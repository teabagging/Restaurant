We had heard that they had amazing, upscale Southern comfort food, so we were really excited to try this place!\\n\\nSince we had a reservation, we were immediately escorted and seated at one of their tables upstairs.  Judging from the table setting and linen napkin, I immediately realized this was going to be very fancy.  I hadn't looked up this restaurant on Yelp prior to my visit, so I didn't really know what to expect.\\n\\nAfter looking at the menu for a few minutes, we ordered Fried Green Tomatoes to share, and I decided on the Buttermilk Fried Chicken for my entree.  It didn't take too long for our food to arrive, which was nice.\\n\\n* Fried Green Tomatoes ($7.50) - This was only the second time in my life that I had fried green tomatoes, and I guess I know for sure now that I'm not a fan.  These in particular were smothered in a marinara-like red pepper sauce and goat cheese.  They were okay, but I don't like goat cheese and realized that I really don't like the crunchiness of fried green tomatoes.\\n\\n* Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($17) - The fried chicken entree includes garlic-flavored collard greens and mashed potatoes.  I usually don't really like collard greens, but these were delicious!  I really liked the garlicky twist on the beloved Southern comfort dish.  The mashed potatoes were yummy but nothing out of the ordinary.  The fried chicken itself was good - and I loved the fact that it is served deboned!  However, the flavor of the batter wasn't anything spectacular, so I don't understand how this entree could be worth $17!  I've had much better-tasting Southern fried chicken in L.A. that's affordable!\\n\\nOverall, South City Kitchen gets 3.5 stars for their good food and great service, but the food is super overpriced for what it is.  I realize it is an upscale restaurant, but for the price, I expected a whole lot more out of the fried chicken entree.

The collard greens they served on the side were the first I'd ever tried, and they were so good that I learned how to make them and cook them at home about once or twice a week now. My boyfriend got the brisket on one occasion and it was delicious, but after you've tried the chicken it's possible you won't want anything else. I've tried a few different cocktails since the first time I've been there, and I've liked them all. They make a decent whiskey sour, which I'm pretty picky about. The only reason that it didn't earn a full fledged 5 stars from me is because of the mashed potatoes that came with my meal. They seemed like instant potatoes to me. Not a lot of flavor and pretty smooth and runny. I don't know if they make them from real potatoes or not, I'm just not really into them at all.

The options are all pretty tasty with a Southwestern flair. I'm a fan of the scrambled eggs with chorizo and eggs benedict, sante fe style. The breakfast burrito is decent but the ratio of tortilla to filling is a little too high. The tequila cilantro salmon over a quesadilla and arugula is interesting, too. Best of all is the $7.95 brunch on Saturdays 10am - 3pm and on Sundays 10 - 11am. You can choose from an empanada or granola to start, followed by your choice of 3 or 4 entrees and coffee or tea. That's certainly a great deal! The corn bread and spreads are amazing, and the chile-dusted fries are pretty good as well.\\n\\nThere are also 50-cent tapas every night from 5 - 7pm and all night on Thursdays. The tapas are a bit small and come on a platter of 10 for $5 total. I wish there was a card or something to explain each bite. While the price is right, there wasn't anything particularly compelling about any of the flavors. \\n\\nOverall, the more trips I make to Masa, the lower my opinion of the restaurant dips.

Once inside, you're faced with the large bar, which allows plenty of space if you're having your meal and drinks there.  Or you have the choice of booths or a side room with lots of large windows to let in the natural light.  They did lower the lights at one point to \\"set the dinner mood.\\"  They have a large and quite up to date beer selection, which I was looking forward to and was happily not let down!  They also have a very decently-priced menu including entree-sized salads, pub-sandwiches and a dessert menu.  We were pleased with both the Buffalo Grilled Chicken and Crispy Chicken Salad; the blackened chicken was substitued for the crispy with absolutely no problems from the waiter.  Speaking of service, it was great.  He was very patient (we were a crowd of loud and indecisive women, soooo) and was very attentive to everyone's orders and drinks, which in my book is necessary.

It is probably the worse meal I have had at a restaurant in years. The shrimp was so over cooked, it was tough.

You just have to. And when you do that, you follow up with a visit to Franklin's Barbecue. \\n\\nMy husband and I really wanted to try out Franklin's. We have heard and read so much. However, I'm not willing to wait 4-5 hours for it. After some reading, it turns out you can pre-order! You don't have to wait in line! You go online, pick a date, pick a time, and you order it. There are a few requirements though: you need to order at least 5lbs of meat, there is a nonrefundable deposit, and you need to pick it up within 30 mins of your time window. Done deal!\\n\\nWe ordered 2lbs of their famous brisket, 2lbs of their pork ribs, half a lb of their turkey, three sausage links, and potato salad for pick up on 1230pm Saturday.\\n\\nWe got there at exactly 1230pm. We checked in at the teal trailer in the back and waited for our meats to be cut and wrapped for us to go. When you pre-order, you cannot eat there. You have to take it to go. There are plenty of parks in the area and the closest one is just down the street. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes, took our food, and walked to the park. \\n\\nNeedless to say, all that food was more than enough for six people. They provided onions, pickles, and bread. \\n\\nThey are famous for their brisket and honestly, it was the best I have ever had. It was a good combination of meat and fat. However, it can get heavy so be sure to eat bread/pickles/potato salad. It was absolutely delicious and melted in your mouth. I couldn't eat too much of it or I'd start getting overwhelmed with the fat and get nauseous. \\n\\nTheir pork ribs was just okay to me. It was overly seasoned and some parts fell off the bone while others didn't. I felt that the spare ribs could be a little bit more fatty. Either that or the meat just wasn't tender enough.\\n\\nTurkey was so-so. I honestly did not think there was anything special about it. Sausage was pretty good. It was seasoned well but it's not something you need to have. I really liked their potato salad because it was on the tangier side of things so it really did help cut out the fat in the meats. \\n\\nEnd point: just get the brisket. That is the ONLY thing worth getting at Franklin's. But even so, I'm not really sure if I would wait 4-5 hours for it. It's not something that I need to have in my life.

Went to pay for it and the cashier charged me 11.99 and .10 for the bag (without telling me that they charge for bags) so, I didn't want to walk back and share he hassle of adding .99 cents to my salami! \\nJUST BECAREFUL WHEN YOU BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE, and ALWAYS TRIPLE CHECK YOUR PRICE \\nTHEY ARE DEFINITELY OUT TO RIP YOU OFF!"},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Enjoyed lunch on Valentine's Day.

They have a bunch of different types of noodles in soup for $5.99 each and they also have different types of Hong Kong styled dishes including the baked dishes with cheese and much more ($8.99). It's just a regular food court store inside Yaohan Centre and there's nothing too special to the design of the store front. I was able to customize my order by switching the regular vermicelli noodles to a thicker type of noodle! They even had lots of other choices of noodles I could have switched to like instant noodle, macaroni and cheese noodles, and other different types of Asian noodles! \\n\\nI ordered the \\"Xue Cai Rou Si Mian\\" for $5.99. The noodles were really soft and the texture was really good. The taste of the soup didn't really stick to the noodles however so it was a little bit bland. The soup on the other hand was perfect! It wasn't too oily, and there was just the perfect amount of salt to it! The veggies on top were cooked just right as well, they didn't taste undercooked or over cooked. \\n\\nI believe they cook their food by order because it was a bit of a wait to get the food and when it came out it was really hot as well!

She spat it out... no need for the epi-pen this time. It was so creamy and the top was nicely caramelized and rigid. I thoroughly enjoy breaking that sugar into little tiny shards and having a little bit in each bite. It was more almond-y than pistachio-y. The only reason I would know it was pistachio was the colour- it was a pretty pale green. \\n\\nOur server was nice. He was somewhat patient with us, being a large group and all. He came by and filled our waters... Ack, it's not him, but a glass of Coke is $3. There are no refills. We brought too many entertainment cards. There is a limit of three.

Unfortunately, both times I was there late afternoon. \\n\\nEvery place has its pros and cons. On the downside, you have to order and pay for your food at a window. You make your order, give them your table number and your server brings it to you. I'm sure they do it for reasons of efficiency but it has it's drawbacks. On this visit my son paid for the snacks and I bought the beer.  When the beer tab came I forgot to add the cost of the chips and salsa to the tip, thus the server got screwed out of the additional tip which probably would have been about a dollar extra since I round up. If this happens regularly over the course of a shift it can add up. Maybe management factors this in. I don't know. \\n\\nOn the plus side, they have a great selection of craft and national beers.

As far as traditional community groceries go, this one serves its people, and visitors like me, as well as any I've ever visited. Let's run down some of the many really good things about it and then I'll give you the couple of things I don't like.\\n\\nI grew up in the Boston area, near Brookline and Newton, and have been to just about every deli and specialty food store in the area. I used to work in supermarkets too, and from what I've experienced The Butcherie matches up with the best anywhere. Service isn't the greatest in the world, but that's not to be expected in an establishment catering to a specific audience that already knows what it needs. In a store like this the key ingredients that make it a success are its product lines (does it stock what its shoppers want?) and its overall quality. On both accounts, The Butcherie does very well. Just a few examples:\\n\\nThe deli: While the selection isn't the biggest in the world, the stuff behind the counter is of higher quality than that of any grocer or specialty retailer in Boston, and perhaps all of Massachusetts. I love the salami and the numerous salads they serve up. I got a couscous salad there recently for which I'd have gladly paid double. The lox is the best I've had in greater Boston. Hands down. Mmmm.\\n\\nFrozen foods. Ok, so they don't stock as much as, and they don't have the same products as one would have in a traditional grocery store. The \\nButcherie's selection is unique, with a great selection of Israeli, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and kosher items. There are fish items, such as the salmon, that, when cooked, was as good tasing as what I've had in restaurants. From experience I can tell you that it's great for those non-Jews who might want to try something different in their regular cooking, or who may be entertaining Jewish or Israeli guests, and don't want to go wrong with the menu. I love the knishes I find here. The lineup is too extensive to detail in one review, but, suffice to say that, compared to even a traditional grocery store, The Butcherie's frozen section stands out.\\n\\nThe shelves are chock-full of specialty products that one might occasionally find in the ethnic foods sections of some grocery stores, although not all the time and not to the extent of The Butcherie's. Here's an example: Go and get some hummus. Once you've tried some of the brands offered here, you'll never go back to Market Basket or Store 24 for what's on their shelves ever again. For that matter, after a couple of trips to The Butcherie, one will find that there are a lot of tastes, and a level of quality, that they've been missing. Moreover, because this is a kosher establishment the quality of its goods is assured. I've heard complaints about it not being open Saturdays, but...come on, it caters to a largely Jewish audience...what would one expect?\\n\\nHonestly, I've never had a bad experience at The Butcherie, except that it is rather cramped and the prices are higher than in traditional American grocery stores. But for specialty items where the quality is assured, The Butcherie stands out."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"SHUT THE SCREEN DOOR. I can't even. I wanted to write this review last night after we ate there but I was speechless from all the yummyness. I had no words. If you do not eat here, you hate food and your life. I don't mean to be so blunt but seriously, love yourself enough to go here and EAT ALL THE GOOD THINGS.\\n\\nWe found this place by accident. I literally was just searching for restaurants in Portland on yelp and this was the first one that popped up. It had great reviews and so we decided to check it out. \\n\\nThe reviews said to expect a wait up to 40 minutes. We got there shortly after it opened and we were hoping the line would not be too long since we were going to a Jimmy Buffett concert and so we didn't have a ton of time to spare. To our delight and surprise, we got a table right away in their outdoor seating area. At first I was skeptical because I thought it would be chilly but it was covered and had hanging heaters and it was actually very comfortable. The host and the waiter were extremely friendly and helpful.\\n\\nOn the waiters recommendation, we both  ordered the fried chicken, mashed potatoes with ham gravy, collard greens and mac & cheese. Oh and hush puppies to start. (needless to say, we ordered way too much food and took half of it home...)\\n\\nThe fried chicken was boneless which was awesome and it is literally the best fried chicken I've ever eaten in my life. The seasoning is great, crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. The mashed potatoes were so  creamy and delish and with that gravy on top of it... Fuhgeddaboutit. I am not a fan of collard greens but the husband had those and he pretty much licked the bowl. I don't normally order mac & cheese in a restaurant because hello... I can just have that at home but you guys... I can't even begin to describe this mac & cheese.... you just have to trust me and EAT IT. Sooooo creamy and cheeeeeeesy. And then the hush puppies! Let's not forget the hush puppies. Again, these are the best hush puppies I've ever had and they came with this yummy pepper jelly that we had to get some to go.\\n\\nVery reasonably priced and we will definitely be back to this place when we are back in the area. \\n\\nDon't think about it.

Myself and three friends loaded up and made the trip down to IDrive. It sounded like some place I'd love to try........... actually, not so much! We got there and was told there was an hour wait to be seated. Being that it is located in the same area as the Orlando Eye complex, we figured we could walk around and check out stuff while waiting. They also have a candy store and an ice cream area in one. Two of my friends got milkshakes which were right around $10.00- they did say they were delicious though despite the price. We looked around the candy store, and I guess their gimmick here is their lollipops. They have pictures of celebrities all over the place with there lollipops.They actually sell bedazzled lollipop sticks with candies that you can replace. These fancy lollipops come at a fancy price: $25.00 a pop (pun intended!). The lollipops even come with a plastic cover to \\"save it for later\\". I think it's kind of gross, but to each their own. \\n   I tried to find a menu everywhere online for this place, but it was next to impossible. I found one and it had a large variety of steaks to choose from. I was disappointed when I was finally able to sit down and read the novel of a menu with only two steaks on it. It was mostly what I would consider, \\"bar food\\". They have apps, hamburgers, flatbreads, and I think some pastas. There is a full liquor bar there. One of the popular items at this place is their smoking drinks. They serve drinks in goblets and when the waiter pours them, they start steaming. We wanted to get one until we found out that they were $35.00, and you can't even keep the glass! What a rip! Every drink I saw like this stopped smoking in less than a minute. The $35.00 goblets have alcohol, however they do sell non-alcoholic ones for $24.00. I saw many teenage girls there drinking them up like crazy.\\n   By the time we were finally able to sit down, the restaurant had turned into a nightclub. They turned all the lights down and were playing club music so loud that you couldn't hear the waitress when asking her questions.. which was pointless anyway, because she didn't even know the answers!!! What kind of waitress doesn't even know the menu of the establishment she works at? This one apparently. I finally just gave up and just ordered a cheeseburger. As a matter of fact, my entire party ordered hamburgers- probably from the lack of choices. The burger came and it was AIGHT. The craziest thing to me about this place was the fact that they sell an icecream sundae for $99.99!!!!! It has 24 scoops of ice cream and feeds 12 people, but there is still no way on this earth I would shell out a hundred bucks for ice cream. Maybe for a kid's birthday party I could see it. What was neat was the sparklers they put in the sundae. Not the cheesy ones they sell at 4th of July- big and fun ones! I'd also like to mention that it was someone's birthday every 5 minutes. I totally understand this would make a good birthday place for some people, but hearing a birthday song with all the waiters singing and dancing every few minutes was a bit much.\\n   So my overall opinion of the Sugar Factory? Touristy, expensive, and over rated.

But really just order the wings, it may be more expensive, but I think they do the wings much better than the whole chicken.  The wings are crispy, sweet, salty, savory, and just too tempting to pass up.  If you think I'm wrong, then you are not human.  So what do they do to their wings?  I will paraphrase their website: the chicken is fried 3 times, and hand-brushed with their special sauce made with soy, garlic and \\"sun kissed red chili pepper\\".  Now doesn't that sound mouth-watering?!  And don't forget to pair your wings with sochu, sake or beer!

Worst sushi experience of my life. Even though the restaurant was half empty, it took 10 minutes to be seated.

They then proceeded to bring us the wrong order twice and took another 10mins or so give us what we ordered in the first place.

The miso soup tasted like water, the gomae was dry and tasteless. Clearly not fresh. The chicken katsu looked like it had been eaten and spat back out, and was tasteless. I hesitate to even call the rolls \\"rolls\\" - they were terribly  presented and the fish was mushy. See pictures. I guess the nigiri were the only acceptable food, but I still could easily find something better from the local grocery store's prepackaged sushi. However, they are limited to 6 pieces of nigiri per person. I have never in my life been to an all you can eat that has placed a limit on nigiri. I could still taste the uncooked batter on the tempura and tofu. Food: 0.2/5\\n\\nAmbiance: the actual decor of the restaurant is quite nice. It is clean and newly renovated.

We felt bad for her, but that was all she talked about when she came over to our table.  But we left her a good tip just to be nice.\\n\\nI remember getting take out one weekday evening.  We called ahead and asked how long it would take - they told us 30 minutes.  So 30 minutes later, we arrived, and no food.  We kept asking for our food - which was only two entrees, and nobody really cared.  They kept telling us that it will be out.  30 minutes at home and 45 minutes at Olive later, we got our food.\\n\\nThe food is ok.  It is also very inconsistent.  I get the shrimp risotto quite a bit, and sometimes it's way too salty and sometimes not, and sometimes it's very watery, and other times it's really good.\\n\\nThe free salad and bread sticks are a good plus.  They are unlimited, so it's a good filler if you're really hungry.  The bread sticks are incredibly salty though.\\n\\nThey have wine sample tastings.  So they'll usually pour you a little bit of wine for free to try.\\n\\nPersonally, nothing at Olive Garden is worth the price.

I hadn't realized it would be wrapped up in a skin like an eggroll, but the extra crisp of the shell added a dimension to the appetizer that the soft macaroni and cheese would have lacked if it had been simply breaded and deepfried without it.  The four pieces it arrived as was also convenient for our party of 4.  The out-of-towner amongst us ordered the Clam Chowder, New England-Style with Apple Wood Smoked Bacon $9 and announced that it was really good.  The presentation was kind of cool too, as it was poured into the dimple of the soup bowl right at the table.  Portion-wise it may have been a cup or perhaps 10 ounces, but that's just an eyeball guesstimation.\\n\\nFor my entree, I selected the Lobster Roll, Lemon-Tarragon Aioli (Single - 14) Twin - $23.  As my accompanying side, I requested the sweet potato tots, which arrived quite cutely in a metal fryer basket.  Those were tasty little balls.  I would  have preferred them fried crisper, but still it was hard to stop at just one.  And they were plenty to share with the rest of my table.  I didn't particularly notice the lemon tarragon flavors of the aioli lightly dressing the lobster chunks, whether in taste or in presentation, but the roll arrived toasted, the crustacean pieces chunky and plentiful enough, so I considered it a good basic lobster roll in my book.\\n\\nHaving sampled a few of the other entrees from around the table, I found everything to be pretty good.  The polenta, however, that had come with the Spring Vegetable \\"Stew,\\" Baby Vegetables, Lentils, Parmesean Crusted Polenta, Pea Greens $19, deserves a special call out.  It was quite homey and warming; I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe prices are a tad high for the portion - particularly for the appetizers at least, if not as much for the entrees - but with the discount we managed to obtain in pre-planning our meal, it was a reasonable deal, and a good night was had.\\n\\nThe bar at the Artbar seemed to fill up as the night went on.

I vowed to go this morning (Sunday) before the family got into town, since they would not be up for the effort needed to eat at Franklin. I woke up at 8am and got to Franklin via the bus and crossing 35 and 290 at 8:40am with one other guy in the front of the line. I congratulated him on being first in line, and we chatted about BBQ and Austin. He usually arrives early and his friend or friends will pay for his meal who join him later closer to opening (He will tell the waitress floor person his friend's order at 10am so that they can cut off the line for people who get there too late). His previous favorite BBQ spot was the original Salt Lick location. Some of the benefits of getting there early include being closer to the heater when it's colder like today or being in the shade when it's hot.\\n\\nAround 9am, people slowly trickle in with folding chairs, blankets and coolers. I think on this particular day, it would have been ok getting there by 9:20-9:30 am, although you'll be waiting a bit longer after the first turnover in seats. at around 9:45am, the waitress/floor person turns on the heater. First guy in line and I rejoice silently, but I don't actually join under the heat until around 10:30am. At 10am floor person begins taking meat order estimates so she can inform people who get there later that they may not be able to get what they want. At 11am doors open!\\n\\nI ordered a 1/2 lbs of brisket (fatty), 2 ribs, 1 sausage link, 1/4 lbs pulled pork,1/4 lbs turkey, potato salad, cole slaw, and a Big Red for my lunch, and a sample of meat for my family who will be getting in later in the day. Total ran to just over $30.\\n\\nI receive my tray and grab a seat, snap a few bad pictures because I'm too excited. The meats were all tender and juicy. The brisket was easily the star. fat liquidated, flavors flowing with smoke rings and a black smokey crust. I have never had a better piece of brisket. 1 slice is enough with a folded piece of white bread. I sample some of the BBQ sauces, preferring the sweeter, thicker sauces over the more vinegary one, though going sauce-less is fine too. The ribs were more juicy than ribs I've had in the past, but wasn't the best I've ever had, but still great. The sausage link was different from ones I've had in the past. The meat extremely juicy (seeing a trend here?), but the casting was difficult to cut/bite into. The turkey was surprisingly juicy and the crust was smokey and pepper was the most prevalent flavor, but not overwhelming. The pulled pork was tender and swimming in its own juices. The potato salad was thick and yellow with a mostly mustard dominant taste. The slaw was mostly/all? red cabbage. crunchy and mostly vinegary. Lighter than most cole slaws. It was my first time having Big Red and it just seemed like a sweet less carbonated soda. I'm undecided on the pairing with BBQ.\\n\\nThe service was extremely friendly. checking in on your meal, chatting with patrons, asking if you needed anything else. Of the 5 employees I interacted with all 5 had smiles, were quick to respond with requests and questions and were accommodating.\\n\\nIn addition to the guy in front of my on line who was very friendly, the couple I sat next to at a communal table were also very nice and we chatted about some of my pit stops in Austin and up coming pit stops in Texas.

They cook their mushrooms in something that obviously triggers that.  I didn't actually test this of course, but the mushroom last time really brought the sandwich together so I'm more than a little disappointed by this.\\n\\nThe hot sauces I've tried so far really aren't.  Weirdly they don't just have a big bottle of Serracha.

I'd also switch directions that the place is setup so that you walk in the front door to walk up and order.  Right now it's sort of a zig zag, which doesn't make sense for where they put the drinks.\\n* I'm a little wary of the public servant thing to sell stuff.  If you're a former firefighter or cop who had to retire, you're welcome to that and kudos.  But if you're just part of a chain that sells sandwiches trading on the names of no-joke heroes?  I know they've got some charity stuff, but I'd something overt for when it's a topic I take very personally.\\n* Need to lose the TV.\\n* Don't recycle anything.\\n\\nOther notes: \\n\\n* The place was clearly booming on a lunch hour with a lot of people.  That's usually a good sign.\\n* I should have cared more that they didn't give me more options on my sandwich, but for some reason I didn't.

Average drinks at an above average price.

Just a plate of all ten of their tapas that usually go for $1 each. The tapas did not come to the table for 30 minutes during which we were forced to stare at the bread with three questionable butters and spreads (the low lighting made the three little blobs look like unmentionable products of human metabolism). Tapas were nothing special, of the ten 3 were worth ordering and I was downright scared of the mussel. Following that, there was another 40 minutes of staring at the empty tapas plate waiting for entrees. Well... once we'd been there an hour and a half and had nothing but sub-par tapas and terrible service (we didn't see our server for and hour, so opportunity to order new drinks) we decided to book.

Unfortunately, once we were ready to order, the guy ahead of us ordered extra ribs so we were unable to try the ribs.  The brisket was like none I have every tried in my life.  My young kids are finicky eaters and they devoured their chopped beef sandwiches.  My husband has been determined to get back to Franklin's to try the ribs, so about a week ago we woke-up around 6am and headed to Austin.  We ran into traffic and it added about an extra 45min to our ETA, so once we arrived the line was too long, they couldn't guarantee any ribs, so we left and drove all the way back to Grand Prairie without ordering.  We tried it again on Sunday.  We left at 4:30 am, and we were at the top of the line.  Franklin was worth every bit of our time and gas money.  The brisket is like butter.  It's so good you do not even need sauce.  My husband loved the ribs.  I thought the ribs were good, but to me, it does not compare to the brisket.

Our orders ended up being very influenced by what the servers were bringing to other tables because we were definitely being those creeps peeking over everyone's shoulder to see what they ordered haha. As a starter, we went with the shrimp and grits, which were delicious! It was so creamy and flavorful from the shrimp sauce, would definitely order again! As for the main dish, my bf went with the buttermilk fried chicken, which came with a side of gravy, mashed potatoes, and collard greens  - a must as it is their more popular dish and was also recommended by everyone at the tables around us! Portlanders are so friendly :) I, on the other hand, ordered the beef brisket, which came with a side of bbq sauce, bbq baked beans and coleslaw. Both were great dishes! The fried chicken was peppery and super yummy! The brisket with the bbq sauce was good too, but what I loved most about my dish were the sides. The beans and coleslaw were winners on my plate! We also ordered the Mac n cheese as a side, and you HAVE to try it! I typically don't order Mac n cheese at restaurants cause they're so simple, but here, it was amazing. And we also noticed that every single table had ordered a side of it as well. The noodles were al dente and so cheesy and creamy! After all that food we still had to try their ban-offie pie as recommended by our wonderful waiter. It was perfect to end our meal. The crust was sooo good and the cream was very light.

It was one of the BEST Bloody Mary's I've ever had in terms of flavor.

The friend that accompanied me also ordered a bloody and agreed it was arguably one of the best he's had.\\n\\nFor lunch I ordered the Local Vegetable Curry and found it to be very tasty! I love curry but I am often disappointed with the flavor, this turned out to be exceptional. I liked that it was vegetarian--even though I am not-- and I really enjoyed the naan bread that came with it. The only thing I would change about the dish is that I'd make the portion larger as I was still left a little hungry afterwards, thus I ordered another Bloody Mary ;)\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Beef Tongue Tacos per the recommendation of our server and he really enjoyed them.

It was delicious, but here's a tip, don't try and eat it like a normal burger. If you pick it up with your hands, you will make a mess, and more importantly, totally squish the donuts. Unfortunately the donuts don't bounce back if you squish them, so you're doomed once you do. Also, the bottom donut gets pretty soggy. Flavor-wise though, the combination of everything is perfect. The BBQ sauce served with this is AMAZING, and, honestly, the best part of the plate. I got the jalape√±o coleslaw. It was pretty lackluster until I mixed in the amazing BBQ sauce. \\n\\nThe place is seat yourself, and pretty darn loud. Our server was pretty fine until we were checking out. Apparently the $10 sublime burger deal, according to them, was only for the month of May (I went in mid-June), even though I'm pretty sure that other people on yelp said that they used the discount in June. It was only a $1 difference, but I was irritated that they would not honor it even though it was still up on yelp and said nothing about expiring. \\n\\nWe went for Wednesday night and they did trivia.

Came by a few weeks ago on a Sunday night. Showed up and this place was empty. Perhaps they're just not that popular yet? This was exaggerated by the fact that the venue is huge.\\n\\nWith our voucher, we got 1 dozen oysters in the Expo Kitchen up front. The regular menus looks like bar style food with pizzas and meatballs. This was probably the weakest part of our meal. The oysters just weren't good, I assume part of the reason being low turnaround given not too busy as mentioned above. Oysters do keep for a while, but I think you can still taste the difference. And the shucking needs more work, had multiple pieces of shell that had to be spit out. \\n\\nThen we moved into the back Club Room. Now this part if beautifully designed, love the bar, love the fire pit in the middle. The tables were big and spaced far apart, the chairs were amazingly comfortable. I will call it \\"comfy modern\\" with a Spanish flair. There also appears to be a section on the side that can be closed off for private parties.\\n\\nThe menu itself is tapas style/portions and is divided into 4 sections, cold lighter dishes, hot lighter dishes, pasta dishes, and protein dishes. We were hungry and got 5 to share between the 2 of us.\\n\\nThe best:\\n- Crispy soft shell crab: very lightly breaded and very crispy, the charred avocadoes were also very good. I think this was the best soft shell crab I've had in a while.\\n- Polenta with mushroom/truffle sauce: To be honest it's a very ugly dish when you just look at it, a bowl of brown stuff. But the taste was fabulous. The polenta was very creamy, paired with some saltiness from the toppings. I was very surprised at this bowl was our favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nThe OK:\\n- Grilled skirt steak: Nice char on the outside, average tenderness.\\n\\nThe meh:\\n-  Green beans:  Asian style flavors. I think there was way too much black bean sauce, it was overpowering the whole dish.\\n- Spicy lobster bigoli: Never had this shape of pasta before but it was cooked very well. However the downsides again I think the flavors were not balanced well enough here, way to much zesty tomato flavor, and very small pieces of lobster.\\n\\nOverall: A beautiful restaurant, pretty good meal with some ups and downs. I suspect that they'll get even better with time. However, the prices are quite high for the Club Room dishes, and the meal for 2 easily ran us $200 with the above dishes and a couple of drinks a piece. I think some are simply too high for the quantity of food without serving more exotic ingredients. Will I be back to try them again? Probably, but the price point prevents this from otherwise being in regular rotation."},{"name":"Brother's Pizza & Grille","address":"121 Trapelo Rd","city":"Belmont","stars":"3","text":"The Greek style pizza is great, just as I remember it as a kid.

Could use more sauce and maybe sesame oil? the rice was a. it watery because of the spinach (but no complaints- thanks for making sure the veggies are clean!)

Today, I went back with a friend and ordered another slice of cheese. What I got was a miserable old slice that looked like yesterday's leftovers. It wasn't even warm. I told my waiter that that I thought the slice looked unappetizing, so he took it back and talked to his coworker, who was flipping the pies. I heard him retort that he took this slice and another slice, which was served to an adjacent table, from the same pie. As if cheating two people makes the act just. I then observed him take another slice from the same pizza as before (I know because it was the only one on their pizza rack). This second slice was covered in a ridiculous amount of sauce and cheese, to mask its stale nature. The manager and the two cooks were laughing about this attempt to trick me. They didn't notice me watching them from across the restaurant. I was shocked at how rude they could be. When the second slice came out, it was so soaked in sauce and heavy with cheese that bottom of the slice had consistence of raw dough. Also, when I lifted the top layer of excess cheese, I could see the old stale-base layer of cheese. It isn't wise to treat their customers in such an appalling way when one can throw a stone in any direction and hit a superior pizzeria on the drag. Avoid settling for the cheap option! $0.50-$1.00 and you could buy a bigger and tastier slice somewhere else. I'm not here to advertise, but you don't have to look far. If you want to buy by the slice from mellow mushroom, you could become a victim like me (recall that  I had my second and third helping of humiliation helping. Don't worry they'll comp your slice after they waste your time and laugh about deceiving you). My image of Mellow Mushroom is a pizzeria where patrons are played the fool in the eyes of the staff.

I have been wanting to try this place since it opened BUT there's always a crowd and a line. So on this day my girlfriends and I hit this place early on a TH night and got in right away. However right away we felt rushed. The employees seemed stressed and pressured to hurry us along. We couldnt' even stand there, wait for out friend, ask questions about drinks/menu items. They were kinda rude. The cost per bowl is absurd for the amount you get. I know I am harsh but I rarely give negative reviews but this night was not that pleasant and I was so unimpressed that I have to. I so wanted to like this place based on the reviews.I should have listened to my friend who preferred Michi Ramen. But I so wanted to try this place lol.The order came out fast. I ordered the standard. It wasn't even hot :/ The place is def a hole in the wall and unassuming but that's ok bc we've had yummy food at places like this. But this is not it. There's a signal when we were the only asians in the place-sorry to say :/ The waiters kept coming back asking if we were done basically trying to move us along. The edame was ok. My ramen again was small, over salted, 1 piece of pork, egg was alright-can make my own better-sorry again-and oh just disappointing. I tried my friend's who ordered the pork shredded one and it was not good at all-she didn't even finish it. We didn't try the dry ramen but I would not even go back to try-sorry. I hate giving negative reviews but I just don't get this place-esp the way the service was, the crowds lining up, the price, the taste. Its not even all that. I miss the ramen I had in Hawaii-how they really give you your fill-chewier noodles etc. But I do have to say I liked the noodles more than I expected-the consistency was pretty good.

I came to the old location over a year ago. The last time I came I just loved it. A quant little space with good quality food. I got the vibe that the owners and staff genuinely cared about what they were doing. The decor was cute. The food was delicious and inexpensive. The dessert displays were cute. I remember the space was just too small for how popular it was. Parking was a somewhat stressful tetris like operation. Finding a seat was like winning the lottery. So needless to say, I was excited to try the new location that was much bigger. I was excited yet a little expected it to have lost some of it's charm. I thought since it had gotten bigger maybe it had become overrated.\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that this was not the case. The new parking lot is huge. In the Mills area, many of the restaurants require street parking. I'm not the best parallel parker so parking lots relieve some stress for me. The line was long however it moved fast. It seemed like most people in line had been before and were discussing their favorites. That's the thing I like about places like this: the regulars. Feels like a little community of people who share their love of food.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Meatloaf and a coffee. I'm not sure the exact brand of coffee, but it was very good quality. It had a soothing feeling and aroma. The Meatloaf with chips was very filling. I would have liked to have some veggies either on the sandwich or as an option for the side. Nothing fancy. Some carrot sticks would have been great. \\n\\nThe desserts looked wonderful but we were too full. The desserts are something you either come in solely for or take to go. The meals are too filling to eat a dessert directly after. I liked that the desserts had it's own counter. That way if you decide later you want one, you don't have to wait in the normal line.\\n\\nSo this new and improved Seven Bites has my approval. It has maintained the charm and quality it had in the original location. But now, more people can enjoy it. I'm pretty sure they will open another location in another part of Orlando. Maybe it will be the next 4 Rivers with locations across town. I was happy to see this place is not overrated. I will be returning to try more on the menu."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

However, I have to rant about the sketchy cop they've hired as security there. This past weekend, we hosted a baby one month and reserved 6 tables. The restaurant also booked another party of 2 tables in the back and put up one little screen divider to separate the 2 parties. Which not to mention they kept walking through it with no disregard and knocking it down on our guests. Also I found it a little strange to have people from the other party walking through ours because they're entering the back door.\\nBut back to this sketchy cop. So I can understand that for whatever reason the restaurant needs to hire a security cop. However, when I think of security I think of someone who lays low and perhaps standing to the corner just observing. However, this cop was walking into our party and talking to people as if he were a guest. AND not only was he walking through our party, he actually had the nerve to ask one of the guests for the bottle of wine at their table since they weren't drinking it! SERIOUSLY?! Then while we were changing the baby's diaper, the cop walks over, stops, and starts staring at the half naked baby. SOOO inappropriate! Sorry Saigon Seafood, but this guy needs to be talked to or give him the boot. He's definitely not the type of cop you'd feel safe around.

I think I've only had a meal (lunch) here once and I really enjoyed it but I don't know that it qualifies me to give a proper review. \\n\\nThat being said, I had one of the BEST lobster rolls here. I am a lobster roll purest, my favorite place on earth for a lobster roll is the Eagle's Nest diner in Brewer, Maine. A pound of lobster meat tossed with a conservative dollop of mayo on a buttered and toasted hot dog bun. Nothing more to say. So I was skeptical about the Art Bar roll, especially since it seems they tried to upscale it (lemon-tarragon aioli??) But as it was on the prix fixe $20 lunch special I figured why not....I got two (two!) very generous lobster rolls, on the perfect buttered toasted hot dog buns, nothing but lobster and a bit of aioli (aka mayo in this case) and you know what?.....that tarragon tasted really good with the lobster.

He is a big fan of BBQ connoisseur so he just can be picky.  Regardless, overall the food seemed to hit the spot for both of us and the prices were very reasonable for the portion size and food quality.\\n\\nThe thing that really killed the experience was being seated in a cramped spot in the back of the first floor and then being perpetually ignored by our waitress the entire time.  It took at least 20 minutes to even get her attention for the check and even longer to pay.  She did manage to serve everyone else within sight with a positive attitude and so promptly.  We were both friendly to her upon meeting her so I do not know where we went wrong but so it goes.  \\n\\nThe crowd when we were there on a Saturday evening seemed a bit older (upper 20s-40s) than each of us so that may explain the service.

Apparently it shares space with a burrito joint, and the signs for lining up even directed you to one side for ordering flat patties versus the burrito counter. Seeing nothing but counters devoted to wrapping burritos and making carne asada made me skeptical that we were in the wrong place or came at the wrong time. Oh well, we came for their burger and their frozen custard milkshake so we had to stick with it, even though there wasn't a college student in sight eating anything but a burrito. \\n\\nAfter about 5 minutes of sitting in their loft upstairs, we heard our order called out and, low and behold--burgers were actually waiting for us. The buns were very soft, but not quite burger material in my opinion (didn't add any buttery-ness or crisp texture to the burger). Other than that, the rest of the burger was great--I think the fact that we were mentally eating a burger from a burrito joint was throwing off my senses the entire night. No complaints on their dressings or burger patty. Fries were passing, but nothing to write about. \\n\\nThe milkshake which is supposedly made with frozen custard, I looked most forward to, but left a little disappointed with. First sip, and it was very runny and very un-like a milkshake. All the flavors of a vanilla milkshake were there, but it had the consistency of a watery-milkshake (maybe I stand corrected and that's how milkshakes turn out when made with frozen custard?) But I've had frozen custard before and I don't really know how it could make a shake turn out so wet.

The friendly host told us that the two-lobster special would be $30- a price you cannot beat in downtown Boston on the waterfront! During our short wait to be seated, we got a drink from the bar. The long island and margarita were both delicious and refreshing. Only neg. is that they came in plastic cups and there was no salt on the rim of the margarita (maybe we should have asked for salt). We were seated in the outside patio in about 10 minutes, and we ordered the clam chowder and fried shrimp with ginger as appetizers. Both were piping hot and delicious. We both really enjoyed the shrimp. Our main, the two lobster special came with a serving of fries and a small tub of coleslaw. The lobster was cooked perfectly and was very tasty! It quite possibly was the best lobster I've ever had! The fries were crisp and the coleslaw was also nice (note, order another side of coleslaw if you don't want to share ;)). The service was quick, and our server was very friendly and nice. The weather was mild, and we saw the sun set over the city. Overall, we had an excellent experience!

I think that says alot about a business bc kids will eat just about anything and say its good. To add insult to injury the guy there was very unfriendly.  Didn't get a hello nor a goodbye thanks for coming by. Walking into such a small business with 0 customers you would think the man wasn't too busy to even acknowledge us. I guess we interrupted his time on social media. Now to my opinion on these cupcakes.  They were not good I can bake a cake with more flavor and they would be moist and delicious with a cake mix from the store.  My son's cupcake to was super hard and im talking about the cake part I could literally hear my nail tap the damn cupcake! Frosting may as well been from the store. Nothing special about these cupcakes at all Ive read other reviews and like 95% enjoy these cupcakes.  I cant for the life of me figure out how? Maybe if we would have been greeted and made to feel welcomed the cupcakes would have tasted better! Also while in there a woman came in and asked about an order she placed online had her confirmation and everything and the man was clueless!! Omg how do you have the option for online pre order and act as though you knew nothing of it. The man was in the back acting like he was trying to figure out where the cupcakes were comes out asked the woman to bring her printed out confirmation paper like WTH. S he comes back in with the confirmation paper I guess to Prove see wasn't lying bc he made it seem that way. Then he takes the paper goes back to the back just to come back with a lame excuse that it got mixed up.  I doubt they get tons of online orders but what evs. Id say and this is my truth... your better off buying a cake mix and baking your own cupcakes because to  pay for these hard old cupcakes this man gave us was any insult.  They tasted pretty  old as if they had been sitting out at least 3 days. I would have given a better review had the customer service been just a little bit more warm and welcoming. The vibe in there was so far off from what you would expect from a cupcake shop especially with the name HEY CUPCAKE.

Do we dare? We do! So we practically veered into oncoming traffic, parked, and ran to the line lest anyone else get ahead of us. We were told it'd be a 2 hour wait and that the gentleman in brown(5 people ahead of us) was the last guaranteed to get food(they have this shit down to a science). Being the gambling types, we rolled the dice, bought some beers and proceeded to wait. As we are inching closer and closer to the door we are analyzing those 5 people between us and brown shirt, determining that at least one group looks famished and they might order everything in mass quantity. We were getting slightly nervous. Then as were about to walk inside the guy right in front of us has, no shit, 7 people walk up and get in line with him, obviously saving a spot. I could have murdered him, this isn't appropriate line behavior! Now we are full blown stressing, an extra 7 people, how will we eat?! Another 3min and we are about up to order, the late additions order an entire brisket...FUCK!! We get up expecting to have scraps, but the guy pulls out the last brisket of the day!! Joy!! There is a God!! We get a pound of fatty brisket, a sausage, beans and potato salad and a couple more beers. Happiness has a face and its this guys after the nerve racking 2 hours spent hoping against hope that the fatties and the 7 add ons didn't clean them out only to get up there and be one of the last 4 persons who got food. Boy was it good, the brisket melted in your mouth, great smoky flavor and a good hint of pepper. Just like Texas BBQ should be. The sausage was delicious as was the potato salad, the beans were whatever. It was amazing and all, but I wouldn't wait any longer than we did, even that was almost too long, had it not been our last day in Austin we would have gone back to la barbeque, which we had two days earlier, and in this mans humble opinion, was better than Franklins.

Whoah, this one was AWESOME.  Very tasty!  If you come here, you've got to get this one for a starter- btw, the 1/2 order is rather large- it could serve as a light lunch portion for some.

Score: 4.5\\n\\nEntrees\\n1)  Brisket Burger- I just had a bite of this burger- the mix of mayo, mustard, and pimiento (sp?) pepper was spot on, and enhanced the flavor of the brisket instead of masking it.  Solid offering.  Score: 4\\n\\n2)  Ribs/Rib sandwich/Rib combo- I've got to say, these ribs were disappointing.  The ribs were so dry that it reminded us of beef jerky.  That's not cool.  The flavoring was a dry rub, which was decent- but dry rub with dry meat = boo.  If they could somehow make these ribs moist and fall off the bone- I would heap praise... but for now...score: 2.5  A BBQ place has to major on the majors- that means ribs!!!   \\n\\n3) Beef Brisket (part of Rib combo)- I'll have to say their brisket is solid- tasty all the way through.  You can have it chopped or sliced- our waiter recommended 'chopped', so I went ahead with it, and didn't regret it one bit.  I just wish I got a little more.  Score: 4\\n\\nSides: \\n1) Mac 'n Cheese- Meh. Texture was mixed- macaroni was overcooked, and there was a graininess to the cheese- egh.  Score: 2\\n2) Collards- These were done well- a tinge of sweetness in the broth that the collards soaked in.  Definitely recommended.  Score: 4\\n3) Fried Okra- Wes C. mentioned that the fried okra at Cracker Barrel were better than the ones here.  Granted, it was nice that they used larger cuts of okra...but yea, not very exciting. Score: 2\\n4) Onion rings- WAY overfried.  Someone wasn't paying attention and left the rings in the oil for way too long.  Score: 2\\n4) Potato salad- very heavy on the mustard- nothing special.  It's got nothing on the potato salad at Maddy's.  Middle of the road.  Score: 2.5\\n\\nSo in summary, you've got a popular BBQ joint (which evidently gets SUPER ratings from lots of people) that has great appetizers, a good brisket burger, beef-jerky-like ribs, solid brisket, and average to below average sides.   Service was very friendly, which is appreciated. \\n\\nI can't give this place more than a 3.25- not until their ribs get softer and easier to eat."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"A very memorable meal and a great, intimate atmosphere that lends well to a small group or a one-on-one, date-type meal.

Just one?\\n\\nThis kitchen is known for its delicious Uptown Southern food - and it deserves its place in Atlanta's culinary history. One of the first to take the New South experience upscale, it blazed a trail for many of the current chef-driven concepts that embrace the New American style.\\n\\nStill, even a trailblazer - or perhaps, ESPECIALLY a trailblazer like SCK - can evolve. No such thing here. The menu, with few exceptions, reads like any other upscale Southern restaurant. The fact that others have COPIED South City Kitchen doesn't alter the fact that it's a dated menu.\\n\\nMy salmon was perfectly cooked, and it was flavorful if overly salty. Had it been allowed to stand alone, this would have been a 4-star experience, but the chef felt the need to embellish it into tomorrow. The rice was oddly crunchy - didn't understand if it was intentional or a blunder. \\n\\nMy dining companion is a runner who limits herself to 1200 calories a day. She ordered the same dish, and left more than half uneaten - not because she didn't like it, but because it was too rich. And remember, we both ordered the only thing on the menu that didn't contain something fried or buttered or sauced within an inch of its life.\\n\\nMoral of the story: Don't go to a restaurant with the word \\"South\\" in its title if you want to eat something healthy. \\"Healthy Southern food\\" seems to be an oxymoron in this town.\\n\\nRECOMMENDED: For Paula Deen lovers."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Happy hour was super cheap.

If Texas De Brazil is a gas guzzling SUV, then Nelore is a compact hybrid vehicle.  Keeping this analogy in mind one can go into this restaurant with a non biased expectation if you have dined at the aforementioned before.\\n\\nThe Nelore location beats the Texas De Brazil location by a mile.  This is a plus.  I can have the same type of dining at a closer location to my house than International Drive.  This is a monopoly which they have heretofore held in this niche in honor of sharing the premium quality of Brazilian cattle.\\n\\nWinter Park offers an upscale environment not seen in  the \\"Touristville, USA \\" that is Texas De Brazil's location.  After dinner or lunch, one can stroll down Park Avenue for some drinks, lounging, good conversation and even great desserts provided at any of the other fine establishments as well as Peterbrooke's (see my review) amazing chocolates.\\n\\nThe interior (see my photo) is rather small, but it feels cozy.  Another one up that this place has over Texas De Brazil in my opinion is that most of the staff is Brazilian.  As a fellow Brazilian, I give this place a full star for such a commitment to its origins as opposed to falling prey to the pressures of multiculturalism to serve a tourist oriented clientele.  This devalues the whole experience.\\n\\nThe salad bar (see my photos) is delicious, offering a reasonable amount of Brazilian cold cuts and vegetables as well as some hot dishes (see my photos) such as the \\"feijoada\\" (just Google it).\\n\\nThe abundance of meat puts all of history's king's feasts up until the early 20th century to shame.  They wish they had a such an amount of food made possible by their clumsy mercantilistic and feudalistic systems with very little divisions of labor.  One full star for true capitalism (not today's cronyism).  Meat for the masses.\\n\\nThe cuts are delicious and very tender (see all my meat photos, hah, don't get any ideas).  They are well seasoned and offered at any temperature.  If not, you can simply request it and they will provide it to you.  This is a traditional 'rodizio' where servers dressed in \\"gaucho\\" style uniforms serve the meats in large skewers and will slice pieces of it in front of the customers upon request.  The customer is essentially seeing the product before he decides he wants it on his plate.  What could be better than that!?\\n\\nThey also serve fresh baskets of \\"pao de queijo\\" or cheese bread which is a traditional Brazilian baked good that is sold anywhere in the motherland.  They are however a bit stingy as our basket only came with three small pieces.  Perhaps the portly server decided to snack on a few on the way to our table.  It was perfectly fine though, as these were not the best I've had.  Therefore, I deduct one star from this very crucial and integral part of a true Brazilian churrascaria.\\n\\nI have not tried their caipirinha here, but I would assume that this restaurant as well as Texas De Brazil are the two best bets for authentic caipirinhas without any type of American twist to them.\\n\\nGo here for a delicious meal in a cozier atmosphere than Texas De Brazil.  Additionally, stroll flatulently through Park Avenue to relieve some pressure and to digest the copious amount of red meat stuck in your belly.

Mind you before I go on, me and my friends have been and/or currently in the service industry. First of all, our server never introduced himself when he approached the table. When my friend made the reservation the host asked if we were celebrating something special and she said it was a birthday. The server did not seem to care at all. The whole time we were there he never smiled or was remotely friendly. When he got our drink order he took several minutes to bring them to the table. Once he brought the drinks he pointed to the empty seat and asked if \\"those people\\" we're showing up, we said, \\"yes they are on their way\\". Not even five minutes later he approached the table and said that if we didn't order now the food was going to take a long time. So we went ahead and ordered. The food took over 30 minutes to get to the table and the restaurant wasn't busy in the slightest. I understand that sushi takes longer to make but it would have been nice if we would all have gotten our food at the same time since we all ordered at the same time. We had to wait about 10 minutes between each roll. So some people had rolls in front of them and others did not have anything for a long time. The food was great as usual. Once we were done eating the server did not ask if we wanted desert he just brought out the checks without any check presenters, mind you we were sitting outside and it was very windy. Once he ran the cards he brought the checks stacked and handed them to one of my friends for her to pass them accordingly. He then said \\"I only have 5 pens so here\\" and set them on the table. With this said, I will come back to eat there because I enjoy the atmosphere and the food, the problem I had with my experience was solely the server. Next time I come I will make sure that I do not get him as my server. Overall, the experience I had was not what I wanted for my birthday. As I mentioned at the beginning, he didn't give his name otherwise I would've stated it in this review. The only thing I can say is that he had a distinctive mustache."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Food at screen door is better than food from the south.

If you are a fan of margaritas or just tequila, it doesn't get any better than this in the Orlando area. The cover is a little pricey at $100 to get into Epcot, but in some respects, it's almost worth it just to go here. If you're visiting Orlando in the intense heat of the late spring, this is also a great stop to get out of the sun for a while.\\n\\nLa Cava is just a small room off to the side of Mexico's bodega. From the outside you can see the bartenders furiously trying to keep up with the long to go line. Various unique and mysterious tequilas adorn the back of the bar. Because it is Epcot, and most folks are trying to experience everything, the turnover is relatively quick so you don't seem to have to wait long to get a seat. \\n\\nWe were seated within 5 minutes, and was able to grab a small 2 seater and trade off our daughter between our laps. A little tight, but worked for us! The tequila list is long and deep with a lot of varieties. We were there for the margaritas, and tried a couple different kinds, including the Jalepeno and Cucumber. The former wasn't too spicy...would have liked a little more bite for my taste, though the tajin salt rim helped provide a little more taste to it. The latter was exceptionally smooth. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty much just drinks, though they do offer a couple snack items. We grabbed the chips and dips which included salsa, queso and guac. A great option to balance out the margaritas. \\n\\nI highly recommend checking this out, especially before you go to the La Fiesta ride - listening to Donald and his buddies quacking their brains out a lot more bearable after a couple tasty margaritas, let me tell you."},{"name":"Don Tequila","address":"6211 Cleveland Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Solid mexi restaurant.

The first time I had Ramen Tatsuya, it struck me as very salty and nothing to be raving about but I think it was an off day because my friend said it usually isn't like this.  After the second time, it was still meh to me.\\n\\nSo I went on a long hiatus from Ramen Tatsuya and tried other ramen places which were all decent...until I tried this one ramen place that was not very good.  My friend's and my taste buds were not happy after that day and I didn't realize how much my taste buds craved Ramen Tatsuya until I took a bunch of friends who've never tried it before. That day, the original tonkotsu ramen tasted so good and so rich. It was still salty but it was so good.  Made me vow never again to say Ramen Tatsuya is overrated.  \\n\\nThe most recent time I went, I got the old skool ramen and I like the noodles but again the broth was way too salty for me.  I think that's normal for Japanese ramen but I'm a big fan of drinking soup.  The portion sizes are good which means I'm not stuffed but I'm not left hungry.    I can definitely keep eating food afterwards but that would be overeating.\\n\\nWhenever I go, there's never really a wait because I go before the lunch and dinner rush, so like 12:30 or 5 pm. There's definitely just as good ramen or better outside of Austin but I'm glad Ramen Tatsuya exists and it's a great place to bring visitors to because of its consistency."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great spot to take out of town guest for business dinner or for those in town for a long weekend.

Upon my most recent visit last night, I realized I hadn't yelped about this place yet and figured it was long overdue. There's a reason (in fact, very many) that it is my favorite bar in Beverly as I have been here so many times over the past 3 years on numerous occasions with various people. While it may not be everything for everyone, it does have something to offer to everyone, as long as you drink alcohol or have an appetite and don't mind paying a few extra dollars for either. \\n\\nI started going here back in early '07 at the mention of my good friend having seen on the Phantom Gourmet show that the Wild Horse had the best nachos you can get around Boston. Let me tell you, the Phantom knows what he or she is talking about! These are THE BEST NACHOS I have ever had. At my age, having eaten nachos at practically every restaurant/bar I have been to (it's a staple appetizer to order when I'm with one or more persons), these nachos put all others to shame. Please take note: I have lived around Albany, NY, Burlington, VT, and now Boston, MA, having eaten nachos in bars, pubs and restaurants either Irish, American, or Mexican. I guess what I'm trying to communicate here is that I am an expert on nachos. What really puts the Wild Horse on top is the portion of their nachos. It used to be you could only order one size and it was enough to feed three grown men. Now you can order either a small or a large. However, be warned, even the \\"small\\" is about as big as any nachos I have ordered from anywhere else. \\n\\nThe bar does have about 25 or so beers on tap (yes, on tap, as in draft), both imports and microbrews, rare and the norm, that they are constantly rotating. It's worth mentioning that this is the only bar I have seen that features Chimay on tap and it's been a mainstay here since my first visit. They also have a pretty good selection of bottled beers including imports, domestic, and microbrew. Then there is the huge martini list where you cannot go wrong (even I have tried and enjoyed a good many of them and I am not a hard alcohol fan). Some martinis even come in glasses dipped in chocolate. The bar itself has a good selection of liquors and hard alcohol. They also feature their own drink of the day that is a unique combination of liquors and juices. \\n\\nI have really only eaten in the bar area, so most of the dishes I have tried were from the bar food menu, but I have tasted a good number of items and in my opinion the food is fantastic. I can only remember one or two dishes that were just okay. The fried chicken and waffles, while an original concept, does not work very well here as both the chicken and the waffles tasted as though they came from a frozen food section, which you wouldn't expect at $17. Although who knew that maple syrup and fried chicken would go so well together. Menu items worth noting include the said nachos, the vegetarian burger, the potato chip nachos, and the buffalo chicken tenders. The fries themselves are extraordinary. There were also some other dishes like scallops with bacon, macaroni and cheese with truffle oil, and ribs over mashed potatoes that were extremely delicious. Now that they keep the bar and dining room menus mostly separate, I'm not certain which of these is still served. \\n\\nAs for the ambiance, I just love it. Dark, intimate, and posh with friendly service. I can't remember ever having a bad experience with a bartender or waitstaff. There are a few flatscreen TVs in the bar that are usually playing sports. I have been here after work, after softball games, on dates, and for nights out and it all jives. \\n\\nWell, what started out as an intended short summary of a review has now turned into a novel. I guess with all that I have experienced here, it comes as no surprise. Take my recommendation and enjoy the Wild Horse for what it is: Beverly's best eating and drinking bar experience."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious southern cuisine served in a lovely atmosphere.

It's good. Can be really good, depending on what you're looking for. They have a lot more gourmet-ish options that other chains like Five Guys just don't offer. The burgers are bigger than Five Guys and more expensive. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong I've enjoyed everything I've ever had from here, and wouldn't hesitate to go if I was craving a burger in Natick, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, and you won't hear me raving to my friends about that one mystically good burger I had at Smashburger. \\n\\nAlso worth noting is that Smashburger CAN have more of a healthy bent, if you're so inclined. They have tasty veggie stick- fry things that are good and different bun options and healthy alternatives, but let it be known that just because they project a semi-healthy front doesn't mean the burgers aren't still loaded with calories, especially if you're ordering a specialty burger."},{"name":"Tony's Italian Ristoriante","address":"16 W Beck St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"The bartender could use a personality infusion.

They prefer gossiping with each other or silence to interacting with customers.  (Well, that is slightly inaccurate, they love the older people, and they have a few favorite customers that I've seen them turn on the shine for.) They constantly ask people for their orders, over and over.  I always fear that my bag will not actually contain what I wanted, but luckily their constant checking in, \\"that was bacon, right?\\"  \\"you wanted a croissant?\\" has always ended with me getting what I wanted. They are gruff, but not in that endearing old-school diner quality way.  They really just seem unhappy to be working there, unhappy to be serving you.  They basically throw your bag at you, even when they are not in a rush.  I often go when its not busy. The poor service is only worth the hassle because I can get full on less than $3.00. \\n\\nThe prices are dirt cheap to match the dirt and grime all over the floor. Really, whenever I have a seat to wait for my sandwich I regret looking down.  Also, they only take cash.\\n\\nAs for the food.... The muffins are great- lots of variety and interesting flavors, not too dry, not too gooey.  If I was rating the muffins alone, I'd easily give them 4 stars, maybe 5.  The bagels are not great.  They are like the cheapest generic you can get at the grocery store and then let sit out on your counter for days - bready, thick, and dry.  The croissants are pretty good.  They have good flavor, but are little dense and can be dry at times.  I usually get them because they are the best option for a sandwich there.  The eggs are good, cooked well and taste fresh.  The cheese looks and tastes like that stuff that comes in those little plastic, peel off packages that turns into watery goop when it's warmed- the stuff you thought was cheese when you were 4 and then grew up to learn was actually just processed junk.  Sometimes the bacon is cooked to a proper crisp and tastes fresh with just enough moisture and not loaded with grease.  Sometimes it tastes reheated and dry.  They have a good variety of coffees and iced coffees.  I'm not really a coffee drinker, but they make a good iced irish creme.  I got a chocolate milk once that was sour and expired.\\n\\nAfter writing this, I'm not sure why I even go.

The crust was flaky/crunchy, instead of rubbery/chewy, which doesn't happen often in Boston. At least IME.\\n\\nThe roast duck, however, was a disappointment. I'm sure if you like soggy duck... which is somehow what I always end up with in the way of duck when I order it anywhere other than German or Chinese,* so apparently this is just something I should get used to and stop ordering the damn duck, but I was hoping it would be otherwise.\\n*Or *perhaps* they should call it something else, such as pan- or oven-stewed or -boiled... but wth do I know, I'm not a chef.

Yes people, this is going to be a long wait. Accept it, bring good company and get pumped because this ain't your normal food outing. This will require a bit of planning and coordination. To me, the insanely-long wait time is actually a testament to how we do it down here in the South. Slow-paced and easygoing. You're forced to socialize with other people waiting in line and even when you get inside because chances are, you will be sharing your table with strangers. That's actually half of the fun!\\n\\nAs for the food, I think the other reviews have done a pretty darn good job of summing it up. So, I'll just leave with this statement...\\n\\nAaron Franklin's brisket is the best piece of cow I have ever had."},{"name":"Fuji At WoC","address":"1420 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Food is amazing here.

Simply, I was never served water the entire meal, I was never asked how my meal was, I had to ask for a refill of coffee, bartender/server botched my order (he actually recommended adding salmon but he neglected to place the order), side order of fruit was served in a big plate not a bowl, and I was never served the fresh cornbread with the 3 types of homemade butter that kind of makes their brunch special. \\n\\nI asked my server about the corn bread, and he said I could have some...unfortunately I had finished my entire meal already.

Walked in on a monday night - place is half full, some of seats at the bar occupied fleetingly by the folks waiting for their take out orders. I nabbed one in the corner and the bartender swung over right away. Excellent service from her, and rapid delivery of food from the kitchen. \\n\\nI ordered fried pickle chips (half order), which came in a basket large enough to make me wonder if they'd made a mistake. But no, my waitress confirmed: the half order is enough for four people to have a pretty serious pile of pickle chips. And if you've never had them? Stingingly hot bites of sour dipped in creamy ranch. A spectacular food.\\n\\nMy main was a 2 meat combo of brisket and pulled pork. When I was ordering I thought I was getting the pork chopped - they asked \\"sliced or chopped\\" - but it was applied to the brisket. Mac and cheese and baked beans on the side. Mac and cheese was smooth and creamy, a calming foil to the spicier beans and sauce. The meats were roundly seasoned, with deep smoke penetrating, and in some cases, overpowering. \\n\\nMy favorite was the pork, with a tenderness and sweetness that can only come from finely controlled low and slow. This was the pulled pork I've missed. The brisket was a little drier, and the seasoning and smoke flavors felt more raw, rising up as distinct notes. I'd go back and try it again sliced, but my waitress suggested that ribs or wings as other good options. \\n\\nA 10 minute walk from the blue line, I walked through the silent neighborhood to get to the station, holding a little extra meat in a styrofoam box.

Only 1 piece of pork. 1 lengthy piece, but still 1 piece.\\n4. Overpriced\\n5. disproportionate hype/wait to actual quality ratio.\\n\\nLong & Thorough:\\n\\nTatsu-Ya is not bad by any means. In my first year in Austin, I've learned to read all reviews of any Asian food in this area with a grain of salt. Meaning, it's relative to the fact that there's not that many options, resulting in food that's never as good as anywhere else outside of Austin.\\n\\nThe biggest issue I had with Tatsu-Ya is the broth. To be fair, I recognize that this is my preference, but I prefer a fuller, \\"stoutier\\" ramen broth. Something where the flavors really had a chance to seep in. Tatsu-Ya's broth reminded my wife and I of the same thing... it was basically Sapparo Ichiban instant ramen on steroids (Sapparo Ichiiban is something most koreans grow up eating). Not necessarily a bad thing, but not what we were craving.\\n\\nI know people don't want to hear it, but it has to be said. You can get much better ramen in LA for 30% cheaper. You can literally walk into a grocery store (like Mitsuwa off Venice) and grab a bowl of ramen for 8 bucks, with 5 chunks of melt-in-your-mouth braised pork belly. Or you can pay 2 bucks more, and get an accompanying bowl of Chashu rice. (I'm referring to Santouka). \\n\\nCall me an idealist, but there's something that just irks me the wrong way when food is essentially zone-priced and zone-\\"Quality'ed\\". Meaning, the quality of the food goes down and the price goes up just because the knowledge and experience of the people you serve is not up to par with other parts of the country.\\n\\nWe just tried Michi Ramen this past weekend. Michi Ramen, IMO, has better overall broth (as well as options), but they do something REALLLLLYY freaking weird. Instead of a good cut of pork belly, they literally use the same cut as holiday ham.

I have no other ramen places to compare it to but I found the broth really salty, but the creaminess of the fat helped mitigate that saltiness.

Heard good things and thought we'd try it. The food is awesome and I won't get into that. My review is solely about their reservation system: they'll let you reserve a table as long as you have 6 or more in your party.  For dinner service, the only time they'll take a reservation for is 5:00 - the time they open. They're very clear at the time you make the reservation that you must be there, with all six people, within 15 minutes or they will give your table away. The problem is, you still have to wait in line to tell them you have a reservation. If that takes longer than 15 minutes, you're out of luck. Try to cut in line and tell the hostess you have reservations could result in an ugly confrontation with others.  When we got to the front of the line and I told the hostess we had reservations she made a big deal about asking if all 6 of us were there. I thought about telling her 'what the hell does it matter when we had to wait in line like everyone else?'  Figured that conversation was above her pay grade and pointless so, let it go. They really need to start their seating process by calling out the names of those with reservations when they open and then 15 minutes later to be fair.

The crew was in the weeds and not communicating about orders. I witnessed over a dozen people ask for a refund due to the wait. Many of these cancelled orders did not get taken off the line, further slowing things down. I was surprised that the girl taking orders was not warning people about the wait before they placed their orders.  They probably should have stopped taking new orders in order to catch up... There was a string on about 30+ orders still waiting to be made.  My lobster roll was good, but unfortunately the cook failed to pay attention to the rest of the order and the burgers contained ingredients we asked to be left off.

The kicker was despite calling in and placing my order at 6:11 p.m., they didn't start preparing my meal until AFTER I arrived and paid. You would think the cashier would be apologetic for the mishap, but nope. \\n- They package to go orders in the same white sheet of paper used at the meat counter at your local grocery store and roll the bread up in the packaging with the meat.  It's quite disappointing to get home and have to 1) \\"unroll\\" your ribs that are 2) mashed/mixed with two white pieces of soggy bread.

The costumes were a little...TACKY. You would think that being in Orlando, which is tourist capital of the world, with sold out shows every night, with how many shows a week...the production could afford more elaborate and detailed period costumes...A few of the characters had decent costumes, but some of them had cheap colored corduroy or velvet with tacky ribbon.\\n\\nThere's assigned section seats by color, and each color section is given a pirate to cheer for. It's pretty fun, there's competitions in the show where you get to scream your head off for your color pirate to win, I imagine it to be especially entertaining if you're boozed up (like my dad).\\n\\nSo..to the food. Not so good. Limp salad appetizer with salty dressing. My sister had this creamy vegetable soup, probably made from a powder. The main course was a chicken thigh (nice and juicy), Caribbean rice (tasted like salt), shrimp (salty), and roasted garlic potatoes (soggy). For dessert, a sloppy pile of apple cobler (not a slice, it was scooped with an ice cream scooper) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. The dessert was the best.\\n\\nThe show was pretty entertaining though, and I think because it was a pirate show I have to give it a good rating.

The brisket was amazing, the turkey was super tender, the ribs fell off of the bone and the flavor was HUGE. The sauce is good, but a bit unnecessary as the taste of the meat is perfect as is. The pulled pork was made to go with their cole slaw and should not be missed either, the beans were made with pulled pork as well and superior!! Totally worth the wait, but they serve only from 11a til they run out and that is usually about 1:30.

I sheepishly admit that I expected the pizza to be hand tossed perfection, quite possibly sprinkled with unpasteurized tears of Jesus . . .. Food orgasm? Not exactly.  Good pizza? sure.  \\n \\nI enjoyed the way Bonos features creative pizzas in a surprisingly simple menu.  No sides, no garlic bread, no mozzarella sticks, no strombolis, heck not even any drinks.  It's pizza.  All pizzas are 10 inches and 10 bucks regardless of the toppings.  Pick one of their creative concoctions or design your own.  \\n \\nWe took advantage of the 3 pizzas for $25 deal and went with the Lady L (pesto based with lotsa stuff), San Rolando (tomato sauce, pepperoni and sausage) and the Carbonara (Olive oil base with some kinda creamy goodness and bacon) \\n \\nWhen I called in my order the female on the phone was very friendly and helpful.  When she asked if Id like arugula or green onion on my Lady L, I asked which she recommend and ultimately took her advice and got both.  I also asked if it was possible to get mushrooms on the San Rolando, \\"Of course!\\" she shouted and,  \\"your pizzas will be ready in 20 minutes.\\"  . . . 3 pizzas, 20 minutes and $25 bucks.   Sweet tomatoes that was easy. \\n\\nUpon arrival I was prepared for Bonos to be located inside/adjacent to a convenience store so no surprises there but I wasn't expecting it to be 120 degrees inside.  I guess there is some science to an 1800 degree oven in an 800 square foot room but it wasn't expecting it to be so sweaty sticky hot.  Luckily we were planning to take the pizzas home anyway, but there is no way Id have been able to sit inside and eat my saucy dough without some manufactured breeze continuously blowing cool air in my face.   \\n\\nJust like on the phone,  the in person staff were super friendly.  The gal behind the counter quickly asked us if we were \\"Kristen\\" and here to get pizzas. I guess we didn't just look like the other kwicky mart customers (i.e. people who celebrate Wednesday with a 30 pack of natty light and 6 scratch off lotto tickets).  We confirmed her suspicions and handed over the cash in exchange for 3 boxes. Being inside the store wasn't all bad, conveniently we were able to pick up some beverages before heading home (OK  . . OK . . so we ARE the kind of people who punctuate hump day with a 12 pack of Yuengling).   \\n\\nPizza was a little cold by the time we got it home (20 minute drive) but I didn't really mind that much. Crust had that wood fired brick oven thing going but one of the pizzas was a lil beyond the basic brick oven char and what I would consider to be burnt.  This was the only gripe I had regarding taste and quality of ingredients. \\n\\nThe toppings seemed fresh and tasty but I found the San Rolando to be spicy.  Not sure if it was the pepperoni, the sauce or the sausage but something was a lil hot for my delicate 10 year old palate.  Carbonara was a tad salty but hey it's bacon so it's expected.  The cheeses were all fresh and tasty - no Kroger bag of mozzarella here.  \\n\\nOverall Id say this is my second or third favorite pizza in Columbus (Behind Mellow Mushroom and Clever Crow) With that said,  Id rather chew on shoe leather dipped in kerosene than eat Donatos so when I say it's good pizza I mean it."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"You have to walk through a lot of people smoking outdoors to get to the place and for a non smoker that's sickening.

We came here for a ladies brunch on Saturday and were promptly seated by the fireplace (love siting by fireplaces ;) Our server was friendly and attentive. But the trouble started when we opened the menu. Their website features a pretty extensive brunch menu but they do a limited brunch menu on Saturdays--like 6 brunch dishes that are not very exciting. Why don't they state this on their website?! We wouldn't have come there if we knew the menu was so limited ahead of time! Since we already had drinks we figured that we should give the brunch a try.\\n\\nWe ordered the the Crab Benedict, Breakfast Burrito, and Frittata. It turns out that the Crab Benedict does not come with any eggs and was missing the sauteed spinach and tomato that was suppose to come on the dish. Seriously, why put a \\"Benedict\\" on a brunch menu and not include eggs---it has to the be one of the stupidest thing I've ever seen on a brunch menu! My bad for not catching that when ordering but when you see the word Benedict on a brunch menu, you assume that it comes with eggs! The crab cakes were good but 2 tiny crab cakes topped with hollandaise served with a tiny salad (my substitution) for $11 was definitely not worth it. The Breakfast Burrito and Firttata were both flavorless and lackluster. The coffee was fine and the blood mary was good. \\n\\nIn conclusion 3 of the 6 items they serve on the limited brunch menu were all terrible. Needless to say it was a mediocre dining experience, at best, and I definitely won't be back unless it just for drinks."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place, My favorite restaurant in Quincy and South shore area since over 4 Years.

Something else that earned Masa some brownie points was the complimentary basket of cornbread and spreads. Free food is the key to winning my heart and after finishing our freshly baked basket of bread you can bet I had stars in my eyes. My boyfriend and I shared a Caramelized Plantain Empanada, Stuffed Mexican Omelette, and Crispy Texas Toast. Everything was served in very fair portion sizes, without being too excessive. Out of everything, my favourite was the Crispy Texas Toast; it was VERY sweet and rich, with a nice bourbon tang to the maple syrup.

The place is always near full but even at noontime I've always been seated immediately. I noticed for the first time today that they have a space in back for larger parties, when a group of businessmen filed out after a presentation. I saw they were each on separate checks, lined up at the register, and the smiling hostess seemed to have no problem keeping the process organized.  \\n\\nMy favorite dish there is the Kung Pao Beef. They have a white board out front with daily specials, which are also printed and handed out at your table (very helpful). One of the recent specials was saut√©ed green beans with shrimp, chicken and beef. My friend ordered it and offered me a taste - quite good. We've christened Hunan Pearl our go-to place for special occasion lunches and are already planning to meet there again before Christmas.\\n\\nParking is a definite problem, so if you have a schedule to keep I'd recommend going at least 15 minutes early to circle until you find a spot.

With my hands or a fork? I ultimately decided since it was an appetizer, and they were cut in half, they must be eaten like fried mozzarella sticks - with hands. It was only until I was down to my last tomato that I figured, what the heck, why not ask the bartender... who laughed good-naturedly and tried not to make me feel bad about my chosen way of eating it, but after my pressing told me that most people use a fork and knife. Oh crap - I thought they were like french fries! I already sat there eating them like a heathen with my hands in front of the kitchen staff. Hah, oh well. So we learn.\\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes were crispy and a little greasy, and tasted great with the goat cheese. I also ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, one of the cheaper entrees on the menu at a hefty $19, and it was really good. The chicken was breaded crispy on the outside and moist and succulent on the inside, and was de-boned for ease of eating. The mashed potatoes were also great, and I enjoyed the collard greens.

We had no idea where to eat, googled and saw good reviews about this place, including a mention in NY Times and an award in Bon Appetit mag for Best BBQ, 2010.  I'm a BA junkie so figured this was the place to try.\\n\\nWe got to Franklin's about 11:15 am and waited in line for an hour in 105F weather--- worth the wait?  ABSOLUTELY!!!!  I've tried all types of BBQ all over the place and Franklin's was hands down the best BBQ I have ever had.  (Sorry Baby Blues, you've slipped to number 2, but next time you guys head to Austin from CA to try Franklin's, you'll understand).\\n\\nBy the time we got in all they had left was brisket and sausage, so we had a plate of each, potato salad and beans on the side.  The sausage was delicious!  Fantastic smoked flavor, right amount of crunch on the casing, with sweet, moist delicious pork on the inside.  No dipping required, but if you like BBQ sauce they have several yummy options, including their house espresso sauce.\\n\\nNow the brisket (fatty or lean, both good!)..... my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  No knives required, as this was the most tender meat I have had.  Stick your fork into a slice of meat and it falls off in delicate pieces onto your plate.  I took a bite and that juicy, smoky, peppered, crispy skinned piece of heaven melted in my mouth. Melted!!\\n\\nTo top it off the owners and staff are SO nice!  Refreshing that they can keep their spirits up even in the craziness of a packed house for 4-5 hours straight!  Part of the charm of the place is having one of the owners come around and check on your meals, keep you posted while in line as to how long the wait and what meat's left, and recommend his favorite BBQ joints in other towns.  And while we were waiting outside in line one of the girls at Franklin's came out with ice cold local brews and sold them to us for $3 a can to help us cool down.\\n\\nI cannot wait until my next visit!

The recipe probably called for an equal portion of oil and rice.  Both chicken dishes were decent but they were doused in so much sauce that the chicken pieces were literally swimming in it.

We're talking ribs, brisket, turkey, sausage and pulled pork with a side of beans.\\n\\nBrisket is the best in town, no contest. The meat is juicy, succulent and has a incredible taste. The crust on the brisket provides the perfect complexity to compliment the intense umaminess. This brisket doesn't need any BBQ sauce.\\n\\nBut if you want to play with the flavors, there are 3 house made sauces, one is a traditional sauce, one seemed to be a sweeter/hotter style sauce and there was what I believe is a espresso style BBQ sauce. And these sauces are great to try with any of the meats.\\n\\nWhile the pork ribs are complimented by a simple but effective rub and glaze, they benefited greatly from the sauces, which add a needed complexity and enhanced mouthfeel. I like my meat succulent to the maximum. Franklin's ribs are tender, but they don't melt in your mouth. I think there is another place in town that has better ribs than Franklin.\\n\\nThe turkey is great. Moist (especially for breast meat) with a perfect amount of bite and a little bit of chewiness. Pepper rub is perfect seasoning for the meat,\\n\\nThe sausage was satisfactory, it did not have the nuance or depth of flavor I would have liked, Again, I think another BBQ place in town has better sausage.\\n\\nPulled pork is good, perhaps a little leaner and less succulent than I'd like, but nothing some sauce can't fix.\\n\\nThe beans are ok, very soft and have a sweet barbecue flavor. The provide a needed contrast to the meat along with the complimentary pickles and onions. \\n\\nIs it worth the wait? For the brisket, yes. The brisket is the star here, this is why people are braving such a fierce queue. \\n\\nThat being said, if you are not about the brisket, I can honestly say there is another place in Austin with a much shorter line and better pork ribs, pulled pork and sausage. \\n\\nBut Franklin's brisket is a gastronomic experience worth a special journey."},{"name":"Porter Ale House & Gastropub","address":"3715 S 1st St, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best burger in town by far!!

Is it a gastropub or a sports bar?  \\n\\nThe big screen TVs above the bar and the proportions of the furniture make it seem like it a \\"man's bar.\\"  I definitely felt out of place at the bar where there were no purse hooks and the stools had no backs to hang a purse or a coat on.  The foot rest of the bar was about 4 inches lower than where my feet are and the stools didn't have feet rests either.  Yeah, not female friendly at all.  One of the owners said they would be getting purse hooks installed, but still, sitting at a fancy bar watching sports tells me I am not the intended clientele.\\n\\nThe prices and food portions seem a little off.  The oxtail coquettes I had were kind of fatty, and there were a lot of them, like too much for one person of the fairer sex to eat alone, even if they had all been the best ever.  The beet salad was much better.  My $10 cocktail was served with a layer of ice chips and I just kept thinking \\"I could be at _____ now, having this drink made perfectly at happy hour prices.\\"  You can't charge craft cocktail prices and then serve a sub-par drink.  \\n\\nLastly, much like a bar, they make you start a tab when you place your order.  That was the first gastropub I've been to in Austin that has done that, everywhere else treats you more like a restaurant and doesn't make you give them your credit card when you order.

My friend and I made reservations for thursday evening in August. We were seated immediately in a corner table in a quiet location. The atmosphere is noisy and lighting  dim;  neon lights  illuminated our space. Although it is a cavernous space, the restaurant was already filled to capacity at 7:30;  both bars were packed with revelers,  and most of the tables occupied. Chef Michael Scelfo prepares small plates large enough for sharing and focuses on bold flavors and likes to contrast textures and flavors. After perusing the extensive menu, my friend and I selected the following dishes:\\n  GRILLED CAULIFLOWER* Charred Radish & Miso Butter, Peanut Vinaigrette - 12\\n  GRILLED LOCAL BLUEFISH*Celery Root Remoulade, Pickled Garlic Scapes - 16\\n  CRISPY BERKSHIRE PORK BELLYRoasted Harry's Strawberries, Anson Mills Grits - 15\\n  SEARED JAPANESE EGGPLANT, Sheep's Milk Cheese, Crispy Fregola & Garlic, Basil - 13\\nI think it  is gratifying that the young chefs of today are willing to elevate vegetables to a high level. Remember the days of creamed spinach and over-cooked peas? \\nThe cauliflower dish is memorable.  Grilled and charred to caramelize the flavor of a usually bland vegetable;  roasted to perfection, accompanied by smears of miso butter, and crunchy peanuts. Highly flavorful!\\nEqually tasty was the Japanese eggplant; a distant cousin to the giant specie used in European cuisine; grilled and charred, with a  sweeter taste, when smeared into the milky cheese, and  little crunchy bites of the fried Fregola; it was heavenly!\\nMy Pork belly was  a contrast in textures. The skin was crispy and brown, but a forkful of pork yielded a soft unctuous center. Accompanied by creamy grits; Absolutely masterful!\\nI tasted my friend's bluefish, grilled and not over-cooked. The fish tasted fresh and sweet. The Celery root was crunchy and distinctively anise-like in flavor; a good choice in contrast. And the pickled garlic scapes were spicy and added a touch of green.\\nFor dessert we shared a fruit trifle. It was decent but not spectacular. \\nThe atmosphere can be noisey, so be sure to ask for a table away from the bars, if conversation is  important  to you.\\nService is professional, our waitress seem knowledgeable and answered all our questions.  My only complaint would be the lack of a good artisanal bread to accompany such fabulous food, The bread served was flat and tasteless. ~Tiaotse~"},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely a mainstay for entertaining out-of-towners.

All in all; we were very impressed with the fish n chips and the burger, and not at all disappointed with the other two.  The brie in the burger was pretty over the top, but was very tasty.  Big portions of fish with great tasting tartar sauce.  The burger came with tasty BBQ flavored fries; and the burger itself, was deceptively large and filling... actually enough to share.

Some tips to help make the experience so much more fun...#1, plan on an epic long wait (3-5hrs). It's a part of the experience to sit in line, get to know your \\"line-mates\\", share a beer, and to get to know one another. #2, Bring water or drink of choice, some breakfast bars or send a friend to grab breakfast tacos - however you do it, make sure you have munchies until the door opens at 11a. \\n\\n#3, I got there at 550a and was #12 in line. Yes, you read that right. If you want to try everything, you have to get there early. Bank on losing your morning and just accept it for heavenly meat party in your mouth! If you show up later, you'll be in the back of parking lot and up the street which means you might not get any meat as they close once the meat is out.\\n\\n#4, if you show up early enough, Franklin provides chairs to sit in but you can bring your own if you want. Someone comes out about 20min prior to opening to remind you to put your chairs away. Don't worry. Nobody will cut you in line. \\n\\nWhat did I order? I ordered about 1/4lb of everything on the meat menu. Seriously, everything is so good but if you want to focus on 2-3 things, I'd say go for the brisket, sausage, and beef ribs. Ask for a mix of fatty and lean brisket. The sides were an excellent compliment and if you still have room, get a key lime or texas pecan pie to finish off! I even got to shake Aaron Franklin's hand as he was visiting the tables. \\n\\nMake it a point to plan your morning here. It'll be so worth it!"},{"name":"No Mas!

It was kind of a eclectic mix of flavors that didn't work. The broccoli was WAY too salty and the quinoa was quite the opposite. The best part of the dish was the fresh avocado and I wish I had more of that, because everything else was underwhelming. The boyfriend had the huevos rancheros , which was kind of more like a nacho plate.

I am rating a 3 based on three factors: service, food and pricing.\\n\\nThe food was decent. It wasn't amazing and it surely wasn't worth the prices we paid. The fries, which were noted on the website tasted really bland, almost like McDonalds fries sans the salt. If you're going to tell me that people are excited for your fries, please show some love and don't just give me soggy potatoes.\\n\\nThe drinks were also way over priced and incredibly small. We ordered a beer for $10 and a couple mixed drinks. the drinks came in really small glasses and had a ton of clutter at the bottom; mainly huge lime wedges which made the bourbon cobbler taste really sour. The beer was also probably about 1/2 of the bottle, which for $10 makes that a $20 bottle of beer... Yeah, methinks not.\\n\\nThe service was also really weird. Though probably not applicable to anyone, we received a really reluctant treatment when we asked for help with the menu. As the three of us are totally blind, we do really need help when going to a place that does not have a braille menu. Acting like we were an inconvenience just makes us feel uncomfortable; had we not just put in a ton of money on the drinks, we would've just left to another place. the other issue, which I found really odd is that our wings plate could not be split. There were three of us that shared the plate; two on one check and one on the other. Since we hsared, we asked to just split the cost, which we were informed couldn't happen. At a pub, I would imagine this would be a pretty common request; the only solution is to figure out who gets to take the entire plate on their tab.\\n\\nThe food was moderately okay, though I don't think I'll be going back. The service was also okay, and the prices were insane. If I could rate a 2.5 I would go with that.

While in town for a visit, one of my traveling companions requested we find a great brunch spot one day. So I put Yelp to the test and consistently what came up through searching and in Talk threads was Screen Door. So we got up early (on vacation none-the-less), put on our comfy shoes (anticipating a long wait) and made the trek over to Screen Door to see if the hype was worth it. We arrived about quarter of 9 and the line was about half way down the block. We were prepared for this though so it was no surprise. I had fingers crossed that we'd still make it in for the first seating but alas, we fell just short (literally, there was one couple ahead of us and then our party of 3...so close!). I'd say you probably need to get there by 8:30 to guarantee a first seating. Luckily since we were about first in line now, we got seats inside, helped ourselves to some coffee and prepared to wait.\\n\\nWe finally got sat after waiting about an hour after they'd opened the doors, so about what we'd expected. Our server came over right away to take our beverage order and while I was super tempted by the Bloody Mary's I'd seen a couple ladies in line drinking, I decided I needed a caffein boost and ordered some tea instead. Since we'd had plenty of time to look over the menu, the 3 of us were pretty set on what we wanted to order. That was until I saw the daily specials menu and it threw me for a loop! I had my eye on the grits up till that point because it's a Southern style restaurant and I figured I should get something southern. (Let me preface at this point by saying none of the 3 of us eat meat...so the much lauded chicken & waffles/biscuits & gravy dishes weren't on the radar for us). One of the specials was scrambled eggs with peppers, onions, & fresh greens and it sounded right up my alley. So I went against my gut instinct and ordered that instead of the grits. It was good, although I will admit I kind of wish I had gone with the grits. Not because the dish I ordered wasn't well prepared and flavorful...but I realized that it was something I could have found on a menu just about anywhere....where as grits are something you don't see most brunch spots. Oh well, something to look forward to next time I'm in Portland!!\\n\\nThe two girls with me went the sweet route and ordered the bananas foster & vanilla bean french toast dishes. The clear winner there being the bananas foster. I believe it elicited an 'OMG' from all three of us. It was plate licking good!!\\n\\nAfter leaving all 3 of us realized that to really have gotten the full experience of this place, we probably should have ordered more of the Southern style dishes, then the typical brunch dishes. But I can understand the hype. I saw the chicken & waffles rolling out all around us and judging by the somewhat orgasmic looks of those eating it, I'm assuming it's as good as it's hyped to be. \\n\\nSo Screen Door, you still impressed us with your great food, quick service and fun brunch atmosphere. Next time I'm in town, I will head back for the grits!!"},{"name":"The Wild Horse Cafe","address":"392 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my favorite places to eat on the North Shore. menu changes often and the specials are always a surprise.

I wasn't a huge fan of the pulled pork because it was a bit dry, but pulled pork is meant to be eaten with bbq sauce so even though I was a bit disappointed, it wasn't too big of a deal. The potato salad wasn't too great and it was a bit too yellow for me so it kinda worried me with how artificial it was, but oh well you don't really care by the time you've eaten all the bbq...healthy alternatives is really your last concern. The turkey and the sausage were good but not worth anything to rave over, but the brisket and the ribs were what redeemed the rest of the food and makes this place deserve far more than 5 stars. \\n\\nI still can't wrap my head around the fact that I waited 3 hours on a normal Tuesday morning for bbq, but my mouth has now tasted the best and all other bbq is now going to pale in comparison.

We shared the above but I ended my meal with the kale salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing that I substituted for the listed dressing. It was great. My friend ordered a different salad and I took one look and ordered mine instead, happy I did. \\n\\nThe drinks were good, my friend ordered cocktails and I sipped wine and then ginger ale with bitters after the french fries hit home but for the Love of all things fried I'd do it again. \\n\\nGreat place, the front is the bar area with a few scattered tables but the back is actually quite enticing with romantic mood lighting. It's also a great date night location without the quiet and/or expensive intimacy. After all it is a gastropub!!\\n\\nGo enjoy, bring your tums if your not used to unhealthy kind of delicious food.

The ambient aroma on entering was wonderful.  The carts came around very quickly and the variety was excellent.  I am no expert and I don't speak Chinese so I do not know the names of the various dumplings, but everything was delicious.  Everything was flavorful and seemed fresh and delicately spiced.  The women pushing the carts were friendly and explained what the ingredients were when we asked.  The table was kept bussed and clean very efficiently.  What amazed me was that even as we were finishing and were all happily full, more carts were coming around with even more types of dim sum than the many we had already seen and tried.  We all agreed to come back and have a completely different array of dim sum on our next visit.  The check was very reasonable, and we had a great time.

I got stewed chicken, yellow rice, maduros, and black beans. The chicken was flavorful and gave the rice yummy flavor. The rice could have been more flavorful, but the extra sauce from the chicken made up for it. Great plantains, I just wish they gave me more.. a lot more. The black beans were okay. They weren't dry or anything, they just had a weird taste. They weren't too salty like they came out of a can either. The waitress (?) asked me what I wanted to drink and I said water; she them preceded to get bottled water from the fridge. I never drank it because I figured it was going to be extra. I was right. Took it off the bill (I noticed a little huff from her but whatever). I got a mango juice Togo and an empanada. I literally gorged myself with that meal, but I couldn't leave the house of empanadas without one! I got ground beef. And it was amazing. Flavorful and big. Lots of dough so I didn't eat all of it. Will Be back to try more. The thing that grew me off was the mango juice. I saw welshs juices in the grab-it-yourself fridge so I asked if the mango juice was fresh. I saw the orange juicer so I assumed it was just juiced mango. Now idk how other Latin restaurants do it, but this procedure was weird.

We also really enjoyed the biscuits and cornbread - truly amazing.  I had the trout and my husband the salmon for our main courses, and both were solid.  To finish, we had the pecan pie, which was piping hot and INCREDIBLE!\\n\\nOther notes:\\n- cute decor, a little loud on weekend, kids welcome\\n- paid parking lot right across from the restaurant ($5 for all day parking on Sunday!)\\n- it's Atlanta, so no cocktails before 12:30pm on Sunday (boo)\\n\\nThe only reason why I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars was the service.  Our waitress was very nice.  But she made us wait for several minutes while she settled out a LARGE table (and we were starving and had somewhere to be). Overall, the pacing of the meal just seemed a little off.  Additionally, she forgot about the brunch cocktail that I was really looking forward to, which really should be a loss of LOTS of stars since I rarely get these brunch cocktails that I so love.

I have seen many shows over the years here at the outside stage, so going to the inside one was new to me.\\n\\nFirst, let's talk about the band itself. I have decided that if Wes Anderson were ever to make a biopic about a band, THIS would be his model. Appearance and attitude-wise, they are pretty much identical to Richie Tenenbaum: retro '70s 'staches and hair, quirky, slightly ill-fitting \\"highwater\\" pants swirled together with a dash of socially awkward. Work. It. *snap* \\n\\nAnd the lead singer needs a chapter of his very own. This guy is SOOOO excited just to be on stage in front of an audience who's listening that it made all of us super stoked to be there. I swear, if he isn't already on Ritalin, he should be, because at any moment I thought he might just start screaming \\"bright lights! OMG I'm on stage! Oooh, is that a plaid shirt?\\" I was telling someone that he reminded me of a mix of Freddy Mercury and a stand-in singer who finally gets his shot in the spotlight. It was tres cool. \\n\\nI'd never been to the indoor venue and it was pretty cool. It reminded me a little of a hunting lodge, with the stage situated on a lower level so that people can gather on the balcony above and practically be on top of the stage. Which is a little odd, but maybe Willie came by and got all the engineers really high while planning this motha out. The structure and paneling is all oak or some kind of unfinished wood, which lends a nice down-to-earth feel to it. Very casual, very Austin. \\n\\nOther things to note:\\n-B&WY had their name written in Lite-Brites at the merch table. This alone made me want to cry with joy. \\n\\n-There was also a completely non-sequitur band tee with a wooly mammoth on it. Are you kidding me? That's so indie it hurts, people. It HURTS.\\n\\n-There was some dude who kept wanting to take shots with everyone who ended up getting tossed out later. When I passed him on the way to the bathroom, he was literally swaying on his feet, dead asleep. I thought he was meditating at first, but on second glance realized that it was just a little catnap. Fabulous.\\n\\n-Some wasted fashionista 17-year-old (well, dunno how old she was but she SEEMED that age) sidled over to me, looked at me long and hard. \\n\\"Hi?\\" I said, wondering if she was going to spew all over my pink coat. \\"Thiiis,\\" she slurred, pointing one finger at me, then revolving it, presumably pointing out my outfit, \\"what you got going on here. Works.\\" \\nI couldn't decide if I was elated because this was the second time in a month I had been complimented by a complete stranger, or concerned for the dangerously high alcohol content swirling in her stomach and the maternal need to bring her some 7-Up and a plate of Zesta crackers. The former won out.\\n\\nI only take off one star because after the show let out right before midnight, the staff seemed a LITTLE too pushy to get us outta there. I actually had left the venue and was on the sidewalk when I realized I had forgotten to close my tab and had to run back in. The door girl was visibly frustrated at me for even coming back in at all to LET ME GIVE THEM MONEY AND A TIP. Suck it up, people, you just had a great turnout and it's gonna take a little time to herd all the drunk cattle out of the pasture. Geez.\\n\\nOh, and I think I might be eating crow. I remember agreeing with Jaye J. (who was also there; she might be my dining companion) on one of the Talk Threads that live music often bored me. After this show, as well as the rockin' venue in which it was housed, I am getting my fork ready and tucking my bib in.

Get a bigger table!\\n\\nJapayoki Fries ($6 small, $10 large) kennebec fries, seaweed, fried chicken, cheese sauce, jalapeno, bean sprouts, sweet soy, togarashi\\n-Something tasty and coconutty in the yellow sauce (cheese sauce?).\\n-Even a \\"small\\" order is heaped high with salad on top and has large white-meat bites of chicken that it's big enough to look like a light meal all on its own. (We're talking ping pong ball sized).\\n-Chicken chunks fairly tender and definitely not dry.\\n-Could have used a plate to toss everything together like a salad.

My bf and I previously came on a late Sunday morning and line was crazy with a bunch of people waiting both indoors and outdoors. After finding out that we would have to wait 1.5 hours to be seated, we left and decided to come back the next morning. We got up extra bright and early and arrived by 9 AM. No line at all and no wait to be seated, but it was most likely because it was a Monday morning when everyone is at work. Fast forward to ordering, I decided to go with the Texas Veggie Migas and my bf got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich. We waited awhile for our food to come out, which kind of sucked. The scrambled eggs in my dish were plenty flavorful with the pepperjack cheese, chiles, salsa, and onion with a side of crunch factor from the tortilla chips. Eating it with the tortilla made it taste like a well put together breakfast burrito. I don't think my dish was all that special though. If I had the right ingredients, I could have easily made it at home. My dish also came with a side of cheesy grits, which I barely touched and didn't bother to finish since I'm not a huge fan of grits anyway. I ended up not finishing my meal because it was way too much and I left feeling overly stuffed. My bf on the other hand enjoyed his fried chicken biscuit sandwich. I would say that it is hard to go wrong with that type of food because how hard can it be to make?? He didn't finish his grits either and agreed that they weren't really that good. Our waitress was pretty attentive with refilling our water and asking us how our food was, which we appreciated. There was also another waitress walking around asking people if they wanted coffee, so my bf said yes, but didn't realize until we got the bill that we were charged for it. So here is a fair warning! The coffee isn't free and they won't let you know. It didn't taste that great either, just plain coffee with the option of milk/creamer.

Going from seeing how long people wait, going hours before it opens, before even the sun rises to the process of all the back of house work to of course, how amazing and heavenly their brisket is, this was a place I could not miss if I ever had the chance to visit Texas. \\n\\nLuckily, for the past 2 months, we had been planning a surprise visit to a close friend of ours who lives in Houston. Finding out Austin is about 2.5 hours drive away, Austin was definitely a \\"possible visit\\" during our trip. My friend had found out a trick to \\"skip the line\\". Franklin's BBQ offers an option to pre-order and pick up at a specified time. Times are released 6 weeks in advance but there are only like 3-4 times a day that's available. Minimum is 5 pounds needs to be ordered but it can be of any combination. We had ordered for 2 pounds of Brisket, 2 pounds of Pork Spare Ribs, 0.5 pounds of turkey, 2 links of sausage, and 1 pint of potato salad to be picked up at 12:30PM on a Saturday. Only downside is an immediate deposit is required but eh not really a downside if you are definitely going.  \\n\\nWe had left Houston shortly after 09:00AM. Stopping at the Buc-ee's in Katy and Bastrop, we had arrived at Franklin's with a few minutes to spare, before our stated pick-up time. \\n\\nThe pick-up is located behind the restaurant, by the coffee stand. Supposedly there are 3 spots for pick-up and coffee but they were full (even when there were no people at the pick up or the coffee place). Luckily, there was a spot on the street that was a few feet away so I had parked there. \\n\\nPick-up is super easy. After you arrive and pay the leftover amount, they will immediately start preparing your order. Each meat will be individually wrapped. Sliced white bread will be given along with sliced onions and pickles as well. Utensils are available in front of the pick up window as well as wet-wipes. As a rule for pick up, it is not allowed to be consumed on the premises. There was a local park nearby (super walkable in less than 5 minutes that is literally a small street away, on the other side of the houses the coffee shop faces. We had walked over and sat at one of the park benches. \\n\\nLaying everything out, opening all the meat packages... oh my ! Everything looked so good ! Especially the brisket ! \\n\\nOf course we had all went for the brisket first. Oh so fatty looking! Oh so juicy! I had taken up some utensils and cut up some bite size pieces for everyone to dig into. OHHHHH SO MELTY FATTY DELICIOUS YUMMY *imitates Homer's drooling face and sound* ! ! !  BEST BRISKET I'VE EVER HAD ! ! ! Wow ! Though, the weird thing is, the later slices of brisket, was day and night compared to the first few slices. Its almost like they have a fatty version and a lean version. Reading another review, it also seems like they do have a fatty and lean version to offer. I would definitely recommend the fatty one all day every day. Fatty yes. Eat often, definitely not. So why not go ALL FATTY ! Still great with bread. Add a little of the BBQ sauce and go to town with it ! \\n\\nPork spare ribs were greatly seasoned, falling off the bone. I was able to pull the bone straight out of the rib then eat it boneless. \\n\\nTurkey was probably the most disappointing of the few meats. Quite dry. Similar to like a roast turkey breast meat. \\n\\nThe sausages were pretty decent. Well seasoned sausage but with a very thick casing. Mildly difficult to cut through with plastic utensils And may be mildly chewy, but still good. Smokey sausage mmm \\n\\nPotato salad was decent but not my preference. It's has a lot of diced pickles giving it a lot of sour notes. Not really my preference. I typically like potato salad to be more mellower. \\n\\nThey do include two types of BBQ sauce, sliced onions and pickles as mentioned so you can make quick sandwiches with the also provided white bread. We actually wanted more bread at some point. Lol \\n\\nIf I ever have the chance to come back, or go to any other BBQ joint from now on, definitely fatty brisket all day ! Maybe ill try to make it myself... Hope I can get it even half as good !

The interior decorating is great too.  Reminds me of Razoo's, which we have in Texas, except with more authenticity.  I ordered the seafood enchilada, and it was chocked full of shrimp.  For the same price, you would get maybe 4 shrimp in a Pad Thai at a mid-grade Thai place.  Unfortunately, the enchilada sauce was less than ideally good and in my opinion shrimp should not be in an enchilada.  Because of the sauce I don't give them 5 stars.

The chicken pieces were big & butterflied with lots of crunchy skin (my favorite part!). The only thing is they used PLENTY of pepper in the chicken breading, making it a bit more spicy than I'm used to.. Oh well, flavor was still great overall & the chicken was very tender. The sweet potato waffle was good, tasted a little sweeter than your typical waffles. The biscuits & gravy were also good, obviously very heavy. They give you plenty of gravy & it was very tasty, wish I had room to eat more of it. Come on an empty stomach, everything is very filling! Also, my friends really enjoyed their hot chocolate & whipped cream. They loved the whipped cream, it very heavy & we speculated that they make it in-house. \\n\\nOverall an excellent brunch/Southern meal in Portland - possibly my favorite meal during our weekend visit!"},{"name":"Greenhouse Coffee Shop","address":"3 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2","text":"thank god this place is finally gone.  i know, i know, harvard square ain't what it used to be but this time this change is for the better.\\n\\ni came here with my roommate back in my sophomore year of college because we lived right outside of harvard.  i wish i had yelp in my life back then because we would have gone to one of the billion other places to eat.  \\n\\nthe common theme here seems to be that on top of the rude service and lack of someplace to empty my bladder and then stare at my face for twenty minutes, they screw up really simple food.  bad toast?  grilled cheese not actually grilled?  i will now add to this we had the worst omelets i've ever come across in my life.  if there's one thing that totally sickens me, it's runny eggs.  i ALWAYS specify when i'm even craving them enough to order them in the first place that i want them cooked.  thoroughly.  \\n\\nthe fact that they couldn't even get the three ingredients i asked for in the omelet right was bad enough, but aside from the inch on either end,  the rest of the omelet was not even cooked.  if i had wanted to eat the omelet more than i wanted to vomit on my plate, i would have had to use a spoon.   and they seemed to have forgotten the cheese as well, or perhaps i just didn't notice a few shreds floating around in my egg lake.\\n\\nwe had been eying the gorgeous looking cakes in the glass case up front, but after barely being able to stomach part of those omelets [that they also refused to fix, by the way], we just wanted out.  i was disappointed to read that they were dry and not up to par with their appearance, but i guess i wasn't surprised.   so, basically, paying mark up on food you could cook better at home, and crappy service to boot, lovely!"},{"name":"The Oakwood Canadian Bistro","address":"2741 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"A nice blend of modern contemporary interior seating with a dim cozy atmosphere, innovative original menus inspired by local Canadian flavors.

A couple of minutes after I took a bite of the sandwich, our waitress comes over and asks if I've already taken a bite. Even if I hadn't... I had very obviously TOUCHED the sandwich.

Would she have taken it to the other table even though I had touched the sandwich?\\n\\nNext major frustration, ven though the sandwich was an accident, we did order the hummus and grape leaves.

The broth was alright, very creamy and a bit over-complicated. I think at one point it just tasted like hoisin sauce? When I think of ramen, I think of a broth that has taken a week to extract every ounce of flavor from the meat, seaweed etc. And what you are left with, is a mouthful of umami.\\n\\nThis place isn't bad, just not a fan.

Then, said it would be 45 minutes to an hour before I would be able to pick it up (when I started calling an hour ago). I asked if there was anyway for it to be faster and she did absolutely nothing helpful.  No sympathy whatsoever. I don't think I will be back to a place that won't sell food now because there is a chance they can sell it later that night. Bad business. The food here is not good enough to put up with poor service."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It's easy to see why there are so many reviews for Screen Door and why there's always a line.

Order wisely, the portions are very generous. I ordered the Screen Door plate where you can mix and match three \\"sides.\\" Note: they consider fried catfish and a whole pork chop as a \\"side.\\" So I ended up getting catfish, pork chop, a beet salad, and all with a side of cornbread.

The cocktails are bourbon focused, the Whodoo Smash being my drink of choice. While very good, it sounded better on paper than it tasted, and was a bit too Bourbon forward and tart for my taste. \\n\\nFood-wise I tried the Nashville Hot fried chicken thighs, which were crispy, juicy, and had a well-balanced seasoning. Those familiar with Nashville Hot chicken may be a bit disappointed with the mildness of this version, but I found it quite good. The street corn was the highlight of the meal, served alongside a delicious dipping sauce. The mac and cheese was gooey and cheesy as advertised, perhaps missing some of the more solid textures I prefer. The only miss was the heirloom tomato salad, which I found lacking freshness and flavor, and would have hoped for a better display of fresh tomatoes. \\n\\nThe pacing of the meal felt a bit scattered. Our food came out before our drinks with no breaks in between each of the dishes. I know this is the idea behind \\"serve as it's ready\\" small-plate restaurants but some sense of timing would have made the meal more manageable.

But it's really all about expectations.  And Five Guys does what they basically seem to set out to do...\\n\\nLet's go to the chart:\\n\\n1) Get you in and out as quickly as possible, maximizing the space inside for seated patrons.\\n\\nCheck!  They have the ordering line going around the outside of the room, although some folks seemed to have trouble understanding the signs (arrows can be so confusing, after all).  They appeared to subscribe to the Fuddrucker's theory of patron crowd management; use your own supply boxes and stores to create barriers that mark off where the cattle are to be herded.\\n\\n2) Simplify the ordering process so as to make it easy and quick.\\n\\nCheck (mostly)!  They have burgers (with cheese and/or bacon as major addons), fries (hence the name), that offer either \\"Five Guys\\" style (which I think is salt, if last night's experience is an indicator) or Cajun enhancement.  They also offer Dogs (with various accoutrements) and Sandwiches (grilled cheese and veggie options).  To wash it all down, they offer soda cups of varying sizes (well, regular or large) that you can fill yourself from their bounteous fountain.\\n\\nOne part of this that I greatly appreciate is the variety of included trimmings for the aforementioned burgers:  Mayo, Relish, Onions, Lettuce, Pickles, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms, Ketchup & Mustard are all included on your burger unless you specifically ask them not to add them.  On top of that, you may add the following items:  Jalapeno Peppers, Green Peppers, A.1.¬Æ Steak Sauce, Bar-B-Q Sauce & Hot Sauce.  Personally I love that they offer to do what I do with virtually every burger I make at home - replace the ketchup (catsup?) with BBQ sauce.  Next time, I will probably pare down some of the other includes as well...but one needs to experience the intended offering at least once, right?\\n\\n3) Serve up your food fast.\\n\\nWell, they kinda fell down a little on this one.  My wife and I probably waited for around 15 minutes (or so) for our meal (2 burgers and some fries).  I'll write this off to them still streamlining the process and getting everyone up to speed.  That said, the guy working the handoff asked us specifically about our number and let us know when our food was nearly up.  Communication and effort count for quite a bit in my narrow, little world, after all...\\n\\n4) Give you food that doesn't suck.\\n\\nCheck!  The fries actually tasted like potatoes (rather than grease and salt) but they definitely left an oil slick on the bag that they unceremoniously tossed them into.

Although when I lived in Boston, I never went out of my way to go here. Anyway, this review is for Brunch only.\\n\\nWas back in town a couple months back for Beer Summit (the most glorious and heavenly ocassions, for which I still travel all the way from DC to attend)... anyway, I was in need of some serious brunch action, and since it was a most fine and unseasonably warm mid-April morning, I REALLY wanted to sit outside, preferably on/near the water. I grew up in Maine on the ocean, lived in Boston for a stint, but alas... life has a way of throwing curve balls to you, and I moved to DC about 3 years ago. You don't know how much you miss the ocean and the sounds of the harbor until it's gone and hours away. I know, brings tears to your eyes, right?\\n\\nAnyway, like I said, I'm intent on sitting outside this particular morning, which is hard enough in Boston with its complete (but understandable) lack of outdoor patios, never mind in a season other than summer. Some friends and I walked around the North End, and eventually meandered our way over to the harbor, where we spotted Tia's. I remember the scoffing and hating that went on when I lived here, mostly due to the tourists, but decided what the hell... it was absolutely gorgeous outside, and I NEEDED a mimosa and a gross amount of food to combat the hangover creeping up on me, and how bad could it be with those great harbor views and beautiful ocean breeze? I'm seriously thankful I put aside any thoughts of negativity and decided to have brunch here.\\n\\nFood was a little above average, and yeah, you pay a premium for it due to its location, but that's to be expected when a place sits in a waterfront location like this. If I wanted, I definitely could have walked all the way over to Seaport and had much better beer and probably better food, but if you've ever woken up the morning after Beer Summit, you know first hand how many footsteps you actually have in you without food before you get really crabby... or maybe that's just me being the bright little ray of hungover sunshine that I am sometimes :)\\n\\nI do agree that drinks are overpriced. $11 for a mimosa is steep, no matter where you are. And $6 plastic cup Sam Adams don't do much to tickle my fancy, but of course none of this stopped me from having like 3 mimosas and 4 beers. Shet.\\n\\nI'm heading back up in a couple weeks for my bachelorette party and opted to stay at Marriott Long Wharf, specifically so I could literally crawl my way downstairs to the outside patio for a glorious, ocean-breeze, $11 mimosa, hangover curing brunch.

The service was HORRIBLE the section next to us had already gotten and finished their food before we even were served ours. When we did get the food it was cold and the desert we received was not what was on the menu yet the table next to us got the desert on the menu (we got vanilla cake with whipped cream and choc drizzle as opposed to the brownie a la mode). My mother was told she would get fruit as her desert to accommodate her wheat and egg allergy and was served canned fruit that was so hard it couldn't even be chewed. They advertise complimentary soft drinks when you really only get 2 pitchers per bench and only one refill per pitcher.  \\n\\n        The show was slow and was confusing as to what it had to do with the story line sometimes and it took a while to even figure out what the story line was. It was also very loud at parts and we all left with headaches afterwards. After dessert we were than given a tip card suggesting $5 per person for adult and $3 per child. We also had to pay $5 for parking which is only mentioned in the fine print on the purchasing page online. Their gift shop literally consist of about 6-7 bookshelves lined along the wall and is basic stuff you could most likely purchase at Walmart.

If you can't get here by 10, I wouldn't even try. Even after waiting 2 hours for the door to open, we still waited 20 minutes in line even though we were only 5-10 people back. Bring a camping chair, some coffee, and a book or card game.\\n\\nNow, on to the food. The brisket is amazing. I have heard they smoke it for 18 hours. It has the perfect mix of fat and lean meat. It easily won the best brisket of the weekend. The sausage was not too spicy and was the perfect consistency. The ribs were super tender and perfectly seasoned. The turkey...get some of the turkey. Unlike most BBQ places, where you end up with dry, flavorless turkey, Franklin's turkey was moist and flavorful. Granted, it probably is the least healthy thing on the menu. The turkey breast was pulled from a vat of butter, sliced, and then dipped in the butter sauce a second time. The pulled pork was a surprise. The rub was a nice compliment to the meat and it was tender. Try it with the vinegar-based sauce for a little taste of Tennessee. \\n\\nFinally, Aaron Franklin is one of the nicest people I've dealt with at a BBQ joint. He was working the counter and personally sliced our meats. He also took interest in our BBQ trip, even coming to talk with us about it while we ate. \\n\\nI have to admit, I was a skeptic. After all the hype this place received and seeing the line full of hipsters, I wanted to hate it. The food, however, speaks for itself. There is a reason why they sell out before 2 every day. Do yourself a favor and make a trip here early one morning before it gets so popular that you'll have to get in line at 6 am."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I know I may tick off the home crowd, however, I'm wondering why are all these people standing in the rain for some BBQ. Sure, Franklin has a dedicated following and yes they serve a better than average brisket, but waiting sometimes for hours - is it really worth it? In my humble opinion, no! The location adds its own set of challenges, the streets are very narrow, and clogged with cars parked on both sides of the streets. My advice is to follow the rules, somewhat similar to the, \\"soup Nazi's, and order on line before you commit to the join the herd. The quality is a solid four but; my biggest disappointment was the BBQ sauce, I didn't think it was anything special even Rudi's tastes better to me. Bottom line, if you separate the meat quality from the BBQ sauce and temper your expectation you may be a potential groupie and wait in line even during inclement weather - and that's no bull!"},{"name":"Nosh On Seventh","address":"2030 SE 7th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I went to Nosh on Seventh one day when I was waiting an oil change nearby.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich and a great espresso.  The food and espresso was all less than 5 bucks!  The place isn't very flashy but it has some great grub.

Aaron is a really cool guy that talks to his customers and cuts your meat order personally. With hundreds of people waiting hours to get in and pay he could have an ego but he and his staff seemed genuinely nice. The brisket IS 2ND TO NONE TO ANY!!! THIS IS THE BEST BRISKET I'VE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE! I've been to Kansas City, Memphis and other Texas joints. I smoke my own low and slow. Aaron's brisket is soft like butter, it's so tender, it melts in your mouth, you don't even need sauce! His ribs are very good, but I had better in Kansas City and my home made ones are just as good. His beef sausage is good and smoked to perfection. The sides and BBQ sauces are ok, the mustard based potato salad isn't for me. I'm indifferent on the pinto beans and the slaw. Overall they are the brisket king of the world so far. But overall I would have to say Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City is the best I have ever been to so far. Arthur Bryant's ribs and sides with Franklin brisket would be a pure BBQ heaven meal fit for a god. Maybe when I have my RV in Austin I will camp out in it and wait again but be one of the first with a chair I bring.

The fresh homemade tortillas are to die for. A must try is the Chicken Relleno my boyfriend gobbled that down it was so juicy. I ordered the shrimp fajitas with veggies, it came out sizzling hot just the way I love it. The shrimp were succulent and delicious. The prices are very reasonable, especially since it's so close to most of the tourists attractions. Once we finished eating we ventured over to No Mas Hacienda the furniture/jewelry  store.

Be nice; no cutting in line, shoving, pushing, or yelling.  \\n\\nOnce you have your food though, the space inside simpy does not accommodate all who wait in line.  Two objects cannot occupy the same space.  It's physics.  The seat count doubles if it's nice outside, as there's a nice outdoor dining space, but even then it's hit or miss.  But I digress; harping on its weaknesses is self serving, because I'm only hoping to dissuade readers from visiting on the weekends in a feeble attempt at shortening the line up for myself.  \\n\\nIf somehow the space were quadrupled, the only remaining request would be that they explore more efficient ways to move people through line.

Just bring a phone and stalk your friends on the internet. Or eavesdrop on conversations. Or bitterly bitch about the degenerate sociopath who just let her 22 friends cut in line after you just waited an hour. I do all of the above during my regular visits. \\n\\nHaving attended the Texas Monthly BBQ Festival and tried most of offerings from the Top 50 (Snow's, City Market in Luling, Cooper's, Louis Mueller's, the Lockhart joints, etc.) I can tell you Franklin outclasses them all.  \\n\\nFranklin's brisket is world-class: gorgeously caked on the outside with Aaron's rub, succulent inside. The ribs are perfect: delicate, moist and even better than when Franklin first opened. The pulled pork is sublime. The sausage, while excellent, loses out to Luling--but because it's not made in-house, that's understandable.\\n\\nAnd the sauces are deep, inspired works. Sure, some BBQ purists eschew sauces as an interference with sanctity of the meat, but that's often because they're gussied up ketchup. Franklin could convert the non-believers.\\n\\nYes, the wait is often more than an hour. It's like the Cartmanland episode (\\"the lines..Lines..LINES!!!\\") Key tips: Don't bother with the weekends--you'll wait at least an hour unless you show up at 10:15...in which case you're waiting about an hour anyway. On weekdays, showing up at 10:40 before the opening or going at around 12:40 before closing usually does the trick. And you will probably leave smelling like a contract labor cowboy from the hickory smoke in the air, but it's a small price to pay. \\n\\nAaron and his staff are friendly, offer heaping portions, and have created something truly amazing. It's easily one of the best in Austin: beautiful food, a superb value, and plenty of kitsch in the experience. They deserve every bit of their success."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Outstanding southern cuisine, excellent service, and nice ambiance!

After one bite of the chicken sandwich we did not eat any more of it and split the cheeseburger, which had was as overcooked as overcooked can be, tough and tasted like nothing. The chicken sandwich was far worse - inedible, microwaved fat and consistency in the meet which was extremely concerning. This time I was desperate and tried the nachos along with a beer, admittedly it is my own fault because I told myself I would only drink and not eat yet I went back on my promise. I told them to hold the chicken as I knew it to be abhorrent. The nachos were inexcusably bad, no flavor on the cheap, mass produced nacho cheese sauce, chips were stale, no flavor to the \\"chili\\" and found a large hair on top of the dish after two bites. \\n\\nI understand this is an airport, I expect to be overcharged and sacrifice quality. I am happy to pay $10 for a beer when drinking next to my gate, that is not the issue.

My friend ordered the Country Benedict (another weekly special I believe - it looked amazing as well) and a Nutella Turbo (highly highly recommend). \\nYou will find a table to seat yourselves after you've placed your order. There's plenty of seating since the tables are so huge and accommodates groups well. \\nWe sat down and not too long after our drinks and food were served. My friend and I chatted for about 15 minutes and next thing I know the rest of the group (who were waiting outside) were inside about to place their order. Again, don't let the long line deter you especially considering the food comes out quick. \\nI loved what I ordered. I'm not a biscuit person but these were an exception - talk about light and flavorful without the cumbersome flakiness. Same goes for the chive grits - they were another exception. \\nI did run into an issue with my fried chicken being undercooked. I mentioned this to one of the waitresses and they said they would address this to the chef. Not too long after I believe the chef came out with a brand new fried fully cooked chicken and apologized and asked if I needed another biscuit/anything else. To be honest, I just didn't want the honey hot sauce to go to waste haha. I greatly appreciated this gesture. Everyone there was very attentive. \\n\\nWe didn't feel rushed and enjoyed the service.

The two-story set up is awesome, especially with the huge, tall windows in the front letting all that sunlight in. In my opinion, they have the best iced coffee in Portland. Most coffee places get lazy with their cold brew and just pour steaming hot coffee into a plastic container which gets put into a fridge overnight. Of course this leads to the coffee tasting like melted plastic molecules because that's exactly what it is. The in-house iced coffee at Two Stroke comes comes Nitro style, infused with nitrogen gas and contained in a steel barrel, and comes out of a god damn tap; stored and served like a good beer. So all you taste is the cool smooth coffee and not cheap tupperware. When you get it to go, it's not nitrogen infused but I'm pretty sure it comes from a glass container so it still tastes great. \\n\\nSo yeah the iced coffee is amazing, the vintage motorcycle decor is incredible, the people are warm and welcoming, and the service is great...so why 4 stars instead of 5? \\n\\nThe ONLY reason I'm docking a star from this review is because they let junkies basically reside at some of the outdoor tables. I've come here at random times of the day, on random days of the week, once or twice a week, for the past month or so and literally seen the same junkie rolling around on a table right outside the door. Today while I was drinking some iced coffee at a table further down away from junkie 1, a second junkie accosted me for a lighter to hit a crack pipe fashioned out of a beer can that he was brazenly walking around with. Now I'm not blaming Two Stroke for him, but junkie 1 sets a bad precedent that says \\"it's cool to hang out right outside of this place and do drugs because nothing will happen.\\" Broken Window theory in effect. \\n\\nI'm not saying call the cops and chuck these people in jail, but at the very least maybe try and get them some help? Either dial up the non-emergency police number or guide them to the nearest shelter or treatment center. Call Salvation Army or one of the many religious institutions that have volunteers doing this kind of work to get them the shelter and immediate help that they might need and that said volunteers are there to provide. But don't force your customers to have to deal with those issues on your premises, or be made to feel uncomfortable after patronizing your business. \\n\\nWith that being said, I love you Two Stroke and I hope you do the right thing."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love this place and the - albeit tight spaced - atmosphere!

I came on a Wednesday night, so luckily it wasn't busy, but I'm sure it wouldn't  be great on a packed night. \\nSecond, there a bunch of arcade games- but they're sticky with beer. I do not like playing Mortal Kombat 3 for a quarter just to have my buttons stick while trying to pull off Cindel's signature hair flip attack on my opponent.

Once you order, there may still not be any open tables, since the room is small and seating is limited. You may end up standing at the edges waiting for a table for another 10 minutes.

We came at the wrong time, the sun was setting and it was in her face the entire time, otherwise it was enjoyable because honestly the A/C was way too cold for me.  The outdoor service was kind of poor as well, my sister had asked for a side of sour cream and spent the entire meal trying to flag down the waitress to get it, which didn't happen until we were both nearly finished.\\n\\nI had the blackened salmon, also from the Cajun side and it was delicious, had rice and substituted french fries for the beans.  The rice again, was spicier than I expected, but the fries were fantastic!  Nice and skinny, perfectly seasoned and fried to crispy perfection.  The fish was also well seasoned and fresh.  My sister had the chicken burros, which looked good, however my stomach has been a little finicky as of late and I didn't try any (she said it was delicious, would have been better with the sour cream though :P).\\n\\nMike D. and I have come here late when we've been around Harvard Square for drinks, and they still serve the chips which are soooo good.

Lacking two or three categories, I'll try to do them all.\\n\\n1) OUTDOOR VENUE\\n-I've seen more shows here in 2 years than any place in Austin, but that's more due to the caliber of the acts than choosing to go to Stubb's.  (They're also pretty good at marketing upcoming shows to past patrons, making it more likely you'll come back.)   Part big dirt & gravel parking lot, part neighborhood ampitheater, the shows have all generally been very well-organized with great sound.  It can be a wait to get drinks, and it's a haul to the port-a-potties, but for the most part it's pretty hassle-free.\\n\\nOne serious negative: it seems that as more downtown housing is being put in, there is more clamping down on noise ordinances.  Hence, we are now seeing concerts there that are, frankly, too quiet to hear what's going on.  That's sad and kind of maddening.  We're in the Live Music Capital of the World, people, and Stubb's was here first.  If you don't want noise, don't be so stupid as to rent a downtown apartment by the live music venues.  Dumb ass.\\n\\n2) INDOOR VENUE\\nDark, standing-room only for all practical purposes, limited bar. I guess that just makes it like most clubs in Austin, so how much can I pan them?  Low ceiling, except over the band stage, which tends to keep the volume up for band patronsand allow the music to overwhelm the later-dining audience in the restaurant.  My advice is to defer to the outdoor shows whenever possible.\\n\\n3) RESTAURANT\\nBBQ is such a personal taste that you almost have to break it down if it's going to be properly reviewed.  \\"I like\\" and \\"I don't like\\" aren't really appropriate.\\n\\n-brisket - cooked well; tender and moist, but not a lot of flavor on its own.\\n\\n-sauce - peppery-spicy and tart, with a little bit of sweetness, Stubb's sauce is one of the best for my palate.  \\n\\n-sides - gotta love a place that gives you serrrano peppers.  Stubb's actually has vegetables! (collard greens, spinach, house salad) as well as some pretty decent fries. The sides get a big thumbs-up for being a bit more broad than most BBQ joints.\\n\\nOne thing I haven't done that I'd like to do is to attend their Sunday Gospel Brunch.  Heard lots of good things about that, and what says Sunday in Austin more than live gospel music in a bbq joint that's catering to people who probably didn't go to church because they were out too late?\\n\\nIt's not my favorite place for food or music, but I find myself here quite a bit.

I mean seriously every corner seems to have a place advertising that they have world famous roast beef. \\nTypically, these places offer a couple of different sides: onions, mushrooms, mayo, barbeque sauce, cheese - but you have to tell them if you want them and they won't tell you. Its just sort of assumed. Since I didn't know any of this, when we arrived at \\"Supreme Roast Beef\\", I asked \\"What's on it\\" to which I received a quizzical look and was told \\"roast beef of course\\". After I figured out that you placed the toppings with your order, I added mushrooms and onions on the large size roast beef, which comes on a sesame bun. I should point out that the roast beef is served room temperature. All in all, not bad - but a definite surprise if you aren't expecting it. The \\nI also got the breaded scallops, which were good - quite juicy in fact. My friends got an eggplant permission sandwich, which apparent wasn't very good as it didn't actually come with permission (hmm) and a chicken sandwich, which was actually quite good.

Find yourself asking what should you eat while your stay up there? My top answer would be: sushi! If you love sushi like I do then Vancouver has many options to offer. Sushi Town is far shy of a fusion or trendy joint. It's a simple local eatery for Canadians, located outside of metro Vancouver City in a more chilled out place called Burnaby. I'm not saying you need to rent a car and make it a mission to this restaurant. There are many places to go to especially in the city but if you are in these parts of town, then I would recommend giving it a shot. Generally speaking, Vancouver truly has fresh sushi, the chefs give you huge cuts, and the most shocking thing to a Los Angeles native like me was the cheap prices. \\n\\nWe stopped at Sushi Town because this use to be one of her spots back in the day. Steer clear from that Atlantic salmon we're so use to down south. That's AKA \\"farm\\" raised salmon. You're in the Pacific Northwest; this is where you order the freshly caught wild stuff. Get yourself an order of the wild salmon. First notice the huge brick-like cuts sitting before your eyes. No, it's not your lucky day. This is how they do it here. Second, look at the color of the fish itself. Yes, that's what wild salmon flesh looks like. It hasn't been poisoned and intoxicated with a bunch of chemicals and what not. If you are looking for a kick, then try their wild spicy salmon. There's tons of Sriracha (Red Rooster) sauce in it. An aZn college kid's past time favorite condiment.\\n\\nI'm so use to seeing Toro and other such special cuts for \\"MP\\" in LA. That's scary talk for: Do you have your nifty credit card ready sir? Not here. Splurge, live, gorge, and enjoy. I've had many sashimi and all kinds of nigiri sushi, including some of their specialty rolls. All pretty tasty overall. \\n\\nBy the way, we're use to saying hand roll but don't be surprised when they say cone instead. Salmon skin hand roll = salmon skin cone. \\n\\nI like Sushi Town because it's pretty chillaxed. The prices are great and the fish (the two times I've went) was fresh.

We easily got a reservation a few days in advance for Saturday at 7:30... a prime time. We found the subterranean location rather easily, as opposed to some other reviews. The restaurant is a quick walk from the busway entrance/exit of the Harvard Square Red Line T Stop. \\n\\nImmediately, we were impressed by the rustic ambience of the restaurant. Exposed brick and raw wood beam infrastructure make a tight space seem large. The lighting was warm and inviting and the place setting was clean.\\n\\nOur server was nice. He greeted us with an explanation of the style of the restaurant and what to expect, and explained to us that the menu worked from lighter fare to heavier fare, from left to right . Since the style is self-proclaimed \\"American tapas\\", we were excited to try a few different items off the menu, but were a bit discouraged about the price points of several of the items. The food seems a little pricey for the amount provided, but it was delicious. A&H might be a bit ambitious for patrons who aren't used to a menu that encourages the customer to try different plates to experiences the breadth of the chef... like Oleana, for example. But on to the food.\\n\\nChips and Three Onion Dip: a good start (fitting right into the mold of an \\"American\\" joint... who doesn't love chips and dip?). The homemade chips were a fun and delicious way to start the meal. The dip was out of this world. Don't pass on this.\\n\\nCharred Broccoli: broccoli was cooked perfectly (any wannabe grill-stars no how hard it is to master the perfectly cooked piece of broccoli on a grill - A&H did it!) and the squash hummus and cashew crumble were addicting. Great play of texture with this choice. \\n\\nMesquite Tortellini: we learned from our server that the \\"mesquite\\" referred to the type of flour used (who knew?). The cheese and non-fishy fish oil were a great addition to this fun yet surprisingly filling small plate.\\n\\nAll in all, we will return to try more of the delicious small plates that A&H has to offer, but would like to see the price points altered to reflect the size and impact that these small plates have on the consumer. Don't get us wrong - it was delicious and worth going to, but I eat at places like Oleana, Russell House, etc. all the time, and this place didn't stand out from that crowd enough to deserve the prices on the menu."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Ambience and atmosphere is really special-- especially if it's a nice day and the front is open!

I got the prosciutto, peach, and arugula salad. It was SO SMALL. Leaves has wilted underneath the dressing. I finished it quickly and looked around for my server so I could order something else before the kitchen closed. Didn't see him in the dining area. Finally got another server to put in an order of hummus-- she was awesome and I got it right away. Also got a blackberry mojito, which was really good.

There doesn't seem to be a proper way to eat it, but digging through a cone with sauce all over your face goes with the whole trailer scene.\\n\\nDue to happy hour, we got free chili-dusted fries with our cone. Overall their fries are nothing special, just cafeteria fries sprinkled with chili powder.

Their concept is you build your own bowl (Kid's $6.95, Regular $9.95 and Large $12.95) with your choice of rice (jasmine, harvest or wild rice) or noodles, select your vegetables, pick your protein, choose your sauce, and watch your food cook in front of you. It's very similar to Mongolian style cooking, but a ton healthier considering the quality, amount of vegetables, and their specialty sauces (which are actually healthy).\\n\\nWhat I love about Goodbowl is that you get an UNLIMITED amount of vegetables, whatever fits in the bowl is yours. I love my vegetables and when I hear the word unlimited, I go crazy. Their selection of protein includes AAA Certified Angus beef, free run/grain fed/ hormone free chicken, Sakura pork, and tofu. Adding a free run egg will cost $1.95, prawns $3.95, or extra meat $2.95 (regular bowl) and $3.95 (large bowl). The prices here are very reasonable.\\n\\nGOOD WATER\\nSparkling water infused with pineapple, cucumber and oranges. Light and refreshing.\\n\\nCHICKEN SALAD ($11.95)\\nStarting with the chicken salad, it's currently a trial item at Goodbowl and I hope it's here to stay! Loaded with oranges, apples and pears along with broccoli, red peppers and spinach, it's definitely packed with vitamins. The well caramelized chicken tastes juicy and I personally eat my salads with no dressing, which works as long as you have the right ingredients in my opinion. Having salads with no dressing is also recommended by Goodbowl to promote healthier eating. There is a dressing for those who consider it a must need though, a light zesty tangy ginger vinaigrette.\\n\\nCHICKEN/WILD RICE/BIG SHAWN'S MIX/EGG.\\nNow onto the stir frys and off the current Top 5 mixes is the Big Shawn's, a sauce consisting of Thai red curry, Hunan and coconut lime leaf. The fluffy wild rice soaks up the delicious creamy curry and exhibits a hint of tanginess and spiciness. The juicy chicken is also well cooked and seasoned (sesame oil, kosher salt and Madagascar pepper), and the perfectly fried egg has a nice crispiness on the bottom. I highly recommend the Big Shawn's mix. And to add an egg.\\n\\nCHICKEN/NOODLES/AJ'S MIX.\\nAnother sauce off the current Top 5 is AJ's mix, which contains teriyaki, chipotle coconut and Hunan. There is a medium level of spiciness, juicy chicken once again, and you can really taste the coconut. AJ's mix is another one of my favourites. The noodles taste really good as well as creamy and I love how there is a plentiful amount of vegetables!\\n\\nANGUS BEEF/NOODLES/MISO MAPLE.\\nCanada meets the far East with Japanese miso, maple syrup and a hit of chilli and garlic. The smokey and caramelized beef has a medium level of spiciness and this is the spiciest dish out of the four (keep in mind we asked for 2 hot peppers for every plate). The miso flavour is a bit lost in the dish and I would have liked some more sweetness from the maple if anything, but keep in mind Goodbowl focuses on healthy eats.\\n\\nANGUS BEEF/NOODLES/MISO MAPLE.\\nCanada meets the far East with Japanese miso, maple syrup and a hit of chilli and garlic.

Pressed to order. Sometimes fresh pressed juices can taste flat, but the ones here don't. I don't often get juices because I have a juicer at home and make my own concoctions, but at $5.95/juice the price is very reasonable. They also offer $3.95 antioxidant Pomegranate shots.\\n\\nENERGY BITES\\nEnding the healthy meal with some energy bites, these are made with oats, natural peanut butter, flax seed, chocolate chips, honey and chia seeds. I would recommend getting these on the go as a healthy snack or to reduce your stomach hungers throughout the day.\\n\\nOverall I enjoyed Goodbowl. From the open atmosphere, properly executed and quality food to the great prices, it'll definitely be a go to for me after a work out in Richmond."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I should try some other Chinese/Taiwanese places, but the food and the service is good enough to draw me there twice.\\n\\nBefore I go into the positives, the one negative is the price. It's unfair for me to compare Chinese food prices in Los Angeles to Atlanta, but it's sometimes hard for me to order dishes, no matter how good and tasty they are, if the prices are higher than what I believe is fair. It's not like they are SUPER expensive, but I'm just use to good Chinese food at a decent price, like whole fish for $10-15 as opposed to $22.95.\\n\\nNow, the positives. Both times, I found there food to be flavorful, but not overpowering. We ordered Pineapple Shrimp, and it wasn't tooo sweet. We also ordered the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, which again, was not tooo satly like other places I ate at. There Bamboo and Mushroom Chicken soup was very good, though I was they had bigger chunks of chicken. It looked as if the chicken was overly cooked and shriveled, that's why the soup tasted so good. We also orderd the sizzling homemade tofu, which had a nice blend of meat sauce with the tofu.\\n\\nLastly, a Taiwanese would not complete without shaved ice or stinky tofu.

It's parked outside my work so I went almost every week. I've had the pad thai at least 10 times. The first time I ordered the pad thai, I asked if they had peanuts in the Pad Thai because I'm allergic. The lady said they don't add any so after my first order, I never asked about the peanuts again. They have ground peanuts and chili powder beside the utensils so that customers can add it to their own food so I figured they never cook with peanuts. \\n\\nI continued to order the pad thai and it was fine for over half a year until my recent experience. I ordered the pad thai per usual. I brought the food back to work to eat. After several bites I noticed some crunchy bits amongst my noodles. To be safe, I decided to throw away the rest of my lunch and good thing I did! Since the nuts were cooked with the noodles and my allergies are predominantly for raw peanuts, I didn't notice it immediately but the effects kicked in soon after. I understand that it is a restaurant/food truck's prerogative to have nuts in their menu and I do not expect any establishment to omit them; however, nut allergies are very common and if there's any changes to your cooking methods, it should be clearly marked and/or communicated. I had the same item from your truck almost every time I ordered so I don't understand why the sudden need to add peanuts. I can't imagine if this happened to someone with anaphylaxis!!! I can't eat at an establishment that doesn't consider allergies and will randomly add peanuts to dishes. I won't be eating here again."},{"name":"No Mas!

Keep in mind we ordered maybe the most simple things on the menu. Within 5 minutes our waiter comes out with chicken tenders for my friend and we haven't even received a glass of water (they told me they were out of cups at the moment) whatever it's not a big deal. They bring our water 5 minutes later, and the water was warm and only filled half way up the glass. Again not that big of a deal. So they bring out my food a turkey club and our goblet drink.

She says she will be back and go get it fixed ASAP. Meanwhile both me and my other friend have finished our food and they are still trying to fix our other order.

I REALLY wanted to like this place. So much in fact, that we tried on 3 separate occasions to have food from there. The first time was about a week before they moved locations. We spent 20 minutes putting together an order for take out, only to be told they were out of more than half of what we wanted to order. We were told since they were moving next week that they weren't getting in any additional supplies, so they were out of a lot. This was a Tuesday btw. Anyway, after trying a couple back up dishes that they were also out of, we opted to wait until after the move.  So the next time I called POST MOVE, I got an answering machine at 4:30 in the afternoon that told me \\"if you'd like to request a carry out order, leave your name and number and someone will call you back in the next 15 minutes\\" (UMMM, WHAT??). But I left a message anyway. No one ever called. So tonight my family decided to give dining in a try. Right off the bat, we were told there were no grits (of all things) which meant no shrimp and grits for me. Again. My husband and I order the meat sampler platter with the chicken, pulled pork, and ribs, which we were I initially told they were out of too, but they got pulled from the oven apparently just in time, and boy were we glad they did. The ribs were delicious!! Unfortunately, the chicken and pork were both WAY over done and dry. My oldest's chicken fingers were burnt, and we were brought the wrong sides, THREE times. Oh, but somehow, 5 minutes after we ordered, there were grits again!! I told our waiter to go ahead and add the shrimp and grits entree, figuring my husband could just take my portion of the sampler for lunch tomorrow. So after waiting a solid 45 minutes after my family had gotten their food. Yes, literally, they had dessert and had boxed their leftovers before mine came. But it was finally there! It looked fantastic, the smell coming off of it was mouthwatering. I thought to myself, \\"well at least this will be worth the wait!\\" And then I took my first bite into crunchy, flat out, RAW grits. I was so bummed. I asked our waiter to take it away and he apologized again and told us he was sending a manager over. She came and said to me \\"so you didn't like the grits?\\" Like it was some preference to have your food actually cooked when it's brought to you. I told her they were undercooked and she asked if I wanted to look at a menu again. I told her no, we had already spent way too long waiting on food. I said the kitchen must be having a bad day because almost everything came out wrong to which she replied, \\"well that was probably server error\\". First off, RUDE. Second, I'm pretty sure our server didn't forget the bacon in our bacon Mac and cheese. I'm also pretty sure, he didn't add the siracha or jalape√±os to NON SPICY bacon Mac and cheese that we reordered to replace it. And he more than likely didn't pick every piece of brisket our of our brisket baked beans before bringing them to our table, burn my kids chickens fingers, or under cook my grits. At any rate, it really is a shame because their patio seating is awesome and their ribs were GREAT, but so not worth all the issues with the food and a manger with an attitude. For what it's worth, she did take the shrimp and grits off the bill (which I wouldn't have paid for anyway) and give us a discount on the rest, but it didn't make up for a disappointing family dinner out. Unfortunately We weren't the only ones who left unsatisfied. We witnessed several other people sending their orders back, and two tables right around us left because everything was taking so long. We felt bad for our waiter who really was trying, but kept getting dealt a crap hand by the kitchen so we still tipped 20% on what our bill would have been before the grits were  removed and discount added but, good Lord, what a hassle this place was.

Bryant whipped out his smart phone to look for options, and he remembered this place called Bono Pizza that was nearby.  We caravaned over and made it after a few wrong turns.\\n\\nIt looks pretty unassuming from outside.  It's a tiny, tiny little pizzeria tucked away next to a convenience store.  If you are going in from outside, you walk in *behind* the counter and go past the SUPER BLAZING HOT wood-fired oven.  They didn't seem to mind that we came in through the back, as the convenience store attached was closed at the time.  You round the corner and jam yourselves into the teeny tiny tables where you feel that you're constantly in the way--but it's also extremely cozy; there was no harsh lighting and it felt homey.  You can bring a bottle of wine or two, although they frown on bringing in mass quantities of alcohol--it's a family place, not a strip club, so use your best judgment, please.\\n\\nThe pizza they serve is cooked in that same wood-fired oven.  I have heard through the grapevine that they trained the people who run Yellow Brick, and where Yellow Brick gets it all wrong, Bono gets it right;  I won't turn this into a slam against Yellow Brick, but Bono uses *real* kalamata  olives on their Greek pizza--they know quality and they don't scrimp.  We got the three pizzas for $25 deal.  They're not huge pizzas, but the flavor is amazing--everything from the crust up.  She even brought us a little dab of pesto to try for the next time, because she heard us talking about the pesto pizza.  (The pesto? INCREDIBLE. Absolutely delicious--it had just a hint of a garlic bite, which is how I love to make mine at home. Mmmmmmm. It definitely DID NOT come out of a jar--unless they put it into a jar after they made it.)\\n\\nThat's another thing, too--the lady there, whom I would imagine is either the owner or part owner, she's definitely very close to the business, was extremely personable.  You know how sometimes it's fantastic when your server gets in on your conversation, instead of really awkward? That was her, she was great--and, mind you, we shared two bottles of wine among the four of us, so while we were not drunk, we were chatting comfortably about a wealth of topics that some may have considered impolite (like the Columbus burlesque/drag scene).  She chatted with us easily and naturally, and we were all charmed.  She and the gentleman cooking our pizza were both of a rare quality in today's go-go-go cookie cutter retail dining world.  I felt like I was visiting their home rather than eating at a restaurant.  I didn't even see any hours posted, and even though it was getting toward ten-thirty, we weren't being rushed out or anything.  (If we overstayed, we're sorry!)\\n\\nCan I just talk about the pizza for a tiny minute more?  Specifically, the Greek Boy?  It had kalamata olives, fresh spinach, feta--the thing that is great about their pizza is that they don't overload it.  The crust is thin, so it's delicate, and they put just the right amount of toppings on.  The spinach on the Greek Boy was heavenly; usually, feta is my favorite part of a Greek Pizza, but I would eat that pizza for the spinach all day long.\\n\\nI'm rambling.  Good food tends to do that to me.  Summation: Excellent pizza.  Great service.  Rare and wonderful people.  Go!"},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Honestly, I want to give this place a 3.5 but I'm not going to let one dish spoil an entire meal. \\n\\nI came here on a Tuesday evening and ordered the Pickled Corn Pancakes for my main and the Chocolate Bread Pudding w/ Salted Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert. I received complimentary pickled green beans at the beginning of the meal, which were DELICIOUS. If they were their own side, I would have ordered it. \\n\\nThe pancakes were heavenly - so flavorful and soft. The peppers added a nice touch as well, and the maple syrup brought everything together. While the popcorn tasted good, it was kind of weird eating it with a fork. The rest of the dish was so delicious though that I would come back just for that.\\n\\nDessert was really disappointing, and I think this was the I've not finished a dessert. The bread pudding wasn't warm and the texture was just kind of \\"gluey\\". I was expecting something much hotter and easier to dig into - overall, the pudding just felt heavy and unappetizing. I would definitely not recommend getting it."},{"name":"Tatte Bakery & Cafe","address":"70 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food here is unquestionably quality stuff. However, I would definitely recommend going earlier in the day. I went here after work once, 15 minutes before they closed. The servers were in a hurry to close down the shop, so the experience felt pretty rushed, but they were nice enough to still prepare a sandwich for me.\\n\\nI tried the tuna sandwich and a plum tart. The tuna sandwich was just basically a really, really good tuna sandwich. The tuna salad was fresh and flavorful, and the hardboiled egg was a nice touch. The grilled bread was the perfect mix of crunchy and fluffy. As someone who loves tuna sandwiches, this is one of the best I've had. \\n\\nThe plum tart, to be honest, fell a little short for me. It probably would have been better warm and freshly baked. I can't argue that it's a well-made pastry: the crust was absolutely ideal. It was dry, crunchy, and crumbly on the outside but gave way to  a soft, moist interior where it met the plums (I'm so sorry, that was probably the most unappetizing description ever...) The plums, however, were a little too tart, and the whole thing was cold. From a previous visit, I've tried the pear tart, and that is wayyy better. \\n\\nI'll be back again and again, but for brunch next time!"},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Habanero Margaritas are killer...and the food is delicious (albeit rich)."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My second time around...I was an awful terrible person and did not wait in line (for the purposes of an experiment that I will explain below).

They arrived at 8am and were underneath the shade by the stairs. \\n\\nWas I hangry and starving last time? Yes. Did that make a difference in the taste? I'm not sure, maybe, probably, who knows! Therefore, I decided that I wanted to try Franklin's at a normal lunch time without waiting in line starving for hours.\\n\\nAnd what a difference it made eating at 11:30 compared to 1:30! The brisket...was amazing. There wasn't a spec of dryness and it was spot on.
