I really had hope for this place...a lot of hope!\\n\\nVenue: Pannullos is a store front indoor outdoor patio style restuarant. I really like the set up outside and the decor on the inside. The seats are super comfy and there doesn't seem to have a lot of traffic so we walked in and were directed straight to our nearest table. Our server was sweet and got our drink order in right away and promptly took our food order.\\n\\nFood: The menu sounds delicious. They have plenty of different options for the hardcore italian or even the pickiest eater. You can add a side salad or soup onto your meal and pick one of their delicious sounding appetizers. I ordered the Italian Sampler which was the chicken marsala or chicken franco, served over linguine with a stuffed shell marinara. We also chose the option of adding on the salad bar. \\n\\nProblem #1: The salad bar was basic, ice berg lettuce with a small bowl of spinach leaves next to it to help green up your plate. A few salad toppings here and there some of which looked like they had been from yesterday's left overs. It was mediocre at best. \\n\\nProblem #2: We ordered sweet teas and water...and you definitely need the water. The tea was over sweetened. Comparable to running through the McDonalds line. \\n\\nProblem #3: The meal. Our plates arrived relatively quickly so I am assuming they mass produce the meals in the back and probably gave us their first batch because it was around 11:30am when we chose to dine-in and they opened at 11a. The chicken was bland and at first bite you couldn't taste any flavor. The sauce had somewhat of a after taste but not a pleasureful one. The mushrooms were cooked well but they had the same flavor. Still hopeful I tried the linguini and it had this weird lemon after taste that almost turned my stomach. My last hope being the stuff shells also fell short, the shell wasn't cooked long enough and was kind of chewy. The sauce it came with was very bland and almost tasted right out of the can. \\n\\nService: I commend our waitress and the chef. We decided to return our food and ask for something else but couldn't find anything on the menu that could save our lunch hour. The waitress tried giving suggestions and even the chef came out to apologize for our experience and gave his personal suggestions. We decided to leave instead of wasting anymore of our time or theirs.\\n\\nOveral: I hate giving bad reviews but I don't like my time being wasted with bad food. I would only reccomend this place if you want some wine. Its a pretty venue and you can't go wrong with wine bottles. You could probably have a nice happy hour on the patio or at the indoor bar BUT I would not recommend this place for food. They did a great job creating the menu and all of the savory descriptions but now I think they need to take some time and work on the actual product. \\n\\nSorry Pannullos...this didn't hit the mark."},{"name":"Storybook Dining at Artist Point with Snow White","address":"901 Timberline Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"LOVED THIS PLACE!

It is a small, intimate space, with lots of wood beams and a general country feeling inside. I think they may have been trying for a French Proven√ßal country feel, but that's just a guess on my part. Local art hangs on the wall, and on my first visit, one of the people I was dining with actually loved a piece of art so much that he bought it on the spot! Anyway, it can seem and feel cramped at times, but I guess that's part of the charm of dining here. Two long tables flank the center of the little bistro, so that should you desire to share a meal with other guests, you have the opportunity to do so. One wall near the service counter consists of an extensive wine collection. There's also a high table near the entrance for those wanting to eat \\"pub-style.\\" Apparently, this place used to be the former \\"Dandelion\\" restaurant.\\n\\nThe menu offerings are interesting. They serve breakfast all day, so on my first visit, I had the frittata, which also comes with a little salad and a couple of slices of the house bread, plus their famous \\"spreads.\\" Well, the spreads are really just orange marmalade, strawberry preserves, and Nutella in big jars, but it's something of a signature of theirs to offer these, and they gave them the moniker of \\"the spreads.\\" Hey, anyplace that has Nutella is fine by me! They also have a selection of open-faced sandwiches, which they call \\"tartines,\\" as well as lasagna and salad dishes. I am a bread-aholic, and their breads here are good, especially the chewy whole wheat bread, which also serves as the foundation for their open-faced sandwich offerings.\\n\\nI enjoyed my frittata, but to be honest, I was fixated on my breads and spreads (I asked for an extra slice of the whole wheat so I can have more Nutella). My first time here was around 830pm, but that didn't stop me from ordering the breakfast, with coffee. I liked the frittata enough, and for the salad, I improvised by making a vinaigrette with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar already on the table. I've also tried their roast beef open-faced sandwich on another occasion, but overall, the breads and spread are what will keep me coming back here. That, and the staff is attentive and friendly. The prices are very reasonable as well. My frittata with coffee comes out to $10, including TIP, so that's not too bad at all.\\n\\nUPDATE: According to the Austin-American Statesman, it seems the businesses in the area are running into some financial issues with the developer and the city.

As starter, we all had some oysters served on a bed of salt with some tomatoes on top. As far as the presentation goes, the result was pretty poor, but this was the leitmotiv of the night.

I've already decided to try to recreate this at home (and will no doubt fail miserably).\\n\\nHubby and I finished up (low carb diet be damned!) with the birthday cake ice cream sandwiches.  How could anyone resist this??  Luckily they are perfectly proportioned out into two adorable servings, more an ice cream slider than a sandwich, so that there is no fork stabbing for the last bite.  \\n\\nAt the end of all that gluttony plus drinks I told hubby \\"Well, that's another $200 meal.\\"  But I was pleasantly surprised at the much smaller bill.  Of course service was fantastic not only from Elizabeth but from all the seemingly happy friendly folks behind the bar.  And, the decor is super retro cute.  I had my eye on the blowfish looking hanging light over the bar, but had to settle on taking a couple of the cute laundry coasters instead (sorry!).  \\n\\nNow I've decided to call my girl and a coupla other couples to reserve one of the bigger tables for a group dinner.  Maybe my stellar Yelp rep will be restored."},{"name":"Jalisco's Restaurant and Bar","address":"6601 S Congress","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Currently at Jaliscos and it is Fantastic!

It's been a busy year for us, so we were genuinely looking forward to having a romantic evening together. Upon making the reservation, the hostess asked if we were celebrating any special occasion, and I hesitated (in fear of drawing unnecessary attention) before letting her know that we were celebrating our anniversary. Now, I am so glad I mentioned that to her. \\n\\nOnce we were seated at the restaurant, there was an envelope on the table. We opened it, and there was a card signed by the entire team wishing us a happy anniversary. I was shocked, it was the kindest gesture and absolutely set a great tone for the rest of the evening. \\n\\nThen our waiter offered us a glass of complimentary wine for the special occasion and even helped us choose a wine that would compliment our order. \\n\\nOverwhelmed with options (they all looked delicious), we decided to go with the tasting menu and the smoked fish tartine, and the chef knocked the ball out of the park.\\n\\nThe tasting menu came with the following:\\n\\nBranzino: The fish was crispy, yet flakey and delicate. There were no overwhelming flavors in this dish, and it was served with vegetables. It was overall light and a pleasant initial course. \\n\\nWagyu: The steak did not disappoint. The meat was buttery and tender, you could have basically cut it with a fork. It was served with potatoes that had a slight crisp to them. Together, they made a powerful and classic duo. \\n\\nSmoked fish tartine: While this was not part of the tasting menu, I felt that I had to try it, and I'm so glad we did. The balance of the fish was perfect. It wasn't too smokey, nor salty/ fishy. Each flavor complimented each other and reminded me of the open sandwiches I ate while growing up in Russia over the summers.  I would absolutely recommend this dish to anyone.\\n\\nOverall, do yourself a favor and go to this restaurant.

The restaurant has a bit more of a trendy atmosphere to it than your typical hibachi place. I ended up ordering the filet and my wife had the sirloin. We opted for the fried rice for a $3 upcharge as well as the bok choy. If you want any vegetables they end up nickel and diming you on them where most other places give you veggies as part of the hibachi experience.\\n\\nAs most hibachi places go there was a lot of soy sauce and a lot of different salts being used. My filet was nice and tender and melted in your mouth. My wife's sirloin on the other hand was a little on the tough side, I sparked that up to lower quality meat and that it was over cooked.\\n\\nOverall the food was good, but I felt bloated and comatosed when we left.

The pancakes have been touted as some of the best pancakes in Boston. I'm not sure I agree. Texture-wise, they are on point. Fluffy af but equally moist if ordered with berries mixed into the batter. However, with the introduction of creative iterations like lemon-ricotta pancakes and souffl√©, I feel like the bar has been set a little higher in terms of what I consider a \\"damn good pancake\\". \\n\\nSeating is interesting. You do not -- I repeat--DO NOT find a seat on your own before ordering. What you do when you first come in is get in line and think about what you want to order. While waiting, someone will come by and ask you how many are in your party and then he'll proceed to look for an opening while you order your food. I'm sure they've run into issues with this method before, especially during the busy hours on weekends, but it's a part of their system so just roll with it. The atmosphere is fast-paced, it gave me a sense of urgency during my meal, which I didn't like. It's not that anybody necessarily tells you to hurry up, but most people here just sat down to eat then leave. I think in the back of my mind, I knew that everyone waiting in line for food was going to be awkwardly standing until a table cleared up, so I picked up the pace as to not be inconsiderate. \\n\\nOnce you're in, it's a delightful brunch experience.

Not to rain down on the people down south because I may soon be moving down here but dang these people here are as dumb as dog #*!!. First off the waitress taking our order (which was only 2 of us) completely messed up. We CLEARLY ordered eggs w/ cheese and raisin bread (which is an option on their menu) and a waffle with eggs & cheese for me. I also watched as she wrote this down on the pad in front of me so there was no confusion of her trying to remember such a large order.  My wife's food came out with regular white bread instead of raisin and my food came out with no eggs and cheese, just a plain waffle.  Ok I let that slide, honest mistake. The staff was rushing to take our plates off the table, they actually took my wife's OJ before she finished it then the bill came out and it wasn't accurate either.  Now the finale, I go up to pay. I paid with a $20 bill plus the exact change on the bill and the young boy behind the register is giving me back change with one less dollar than I was supposed to get back. I kindly stated to him that I think he made a mistake because I paid exact change and I'm due back this amount of dollars with no change and he stated that he was sorry but that's what the computer was telling him to give me back.  Not That getting back that $1 was a big deal but for a quick 15 minute sit down there were just too many flaws and errors made by this facility.  Outside of the workers the place itself was relatively clean, the service was quick and the food was serviceable.  That's why I gave the 2 stars at the least. Would have gave 2 and a half but definitely not deserving of 3.

Lovely little bistro for lunch/brunch. The ingredients are fresh. The plating is beautiful. Cozy, casual atmosphere.\\n\\nIn my one visit here, I sampled several of the tartines. My favorites were the smoked salmon ($9.95, but seriously worth it) and the brie with apricot preserves. The roast beef was so-so, and the prosciutto with mozzarella was good, but nothing too outstanding. I ordered a special, the frittata with asparagus, mushrooms, and Gruyere. The frittata was delicious. In my opinion, it was a better deal than the tartines--a good-sized portion of the frittata with a couple of bread slices on the side and spring mix salad (which you should try with a little drizzle of their balsamic vinaigrette.

Little Saigon remains my favorite I think, but I'm eager to see what else is out there. I also cook a lot of Viet, Thai, and Lao food at home, so always seeking authenticity and trying to learn more about these cuisines. \\n\\nThe interior is small and the space utilized is awkward so yes, as Anh T. noted, there's a little side area which for some patrons may feel like being sent off to Siberia. Worry not, where-ever you are sitting, expect the service to be rather pokey. I was there late in the afternoon and only a couple other tables were even occupied but nonetheless, the kitchen was very slow getting food out and the waiter seemed disinterested and distracted by other work (we can only hope, he may have been catching Pok√©mon for all I know) he was doing in the small office/cashier area. \\n\\nI ordered bun (noodle-based salad with salad green garnish and choice of meat) with beef. It's not a complex dish to put together, yet it took (as I noted) ample time to be brought out. The only plausible explanation would be that only one cook was in the kitchen and he had to prep it, grill the beef, and then expo it to the waiter. Which, as I only saw that one waiter also, would mean one person back of house, one front of house. Even in the slow period between lunch and dinner (they remain open from start of lunch all through until finish of the dinner hour) this would be a hell of a gamble, to risk two people running the whole operation. But I kinda think that was the case. \\n\\nThe dish however was quite good: the seasonings were nearly perfect and the quality of meat used was fine--not fatty at all. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. For that I'm giving them four stars and only subtracting one for the wait and the weird layout of the restaurant (yes, it shares restrooms with a nail salon and those are out back in a passageway). Why? Because many very good Viet restaurant across the land are hole-in-the-wall places so I cannot fault them from being such when at the epicenter of Colonialtown which is as close to an Asian-town like a Chinatown as you'll probably find in Florida. I would not fault this restaurant for being a bit quirky were it in San Francisco's Chinatown where I used to live, so I won't fault it here, either.

We ordered the cold seafood platter and at $85 dollars we certainly expected much much better. We've had platters at both Joe Fortes and Bluewater and would gladly go there any day over this. The clams and mussels were good, but all of the shrimp were sitting in pools of water, the scallops were bland, the calamari (or octopus?) was tasteless and chewy. Our waitress was sweet however, and I had a lovely glass of rose. \\nDefinitely not anniversary material. Should have ordered an entree perhaps or some of the more pub-style food.

The picanha was great but unfortunately it's about all I can say positively. I was so surprised to hear from the staff that they do not serve fraudinha (flank steak) which is a staple in any charrascaria for lunch.... I WAS THERE FOR DINNER...! (Just for substance; I was there with my son and the bill was over $100, about 50 each). The part that sincerely made me worried, was the reason given for not having flank steak; he simply advised that ownership of the restaurant did not want to spend money in expensive meats.... I was very concerned that we had just eaten some liquidation steaks and the outcome would be costly later. Now, the very very very limited steak options was a pain; but I could be wrong and it could be that it's not liquidation meat and we will be okay...but when the staff advises that the owners are being cheap on the most important item of your menu; I believe I had the right to be a bit concerned. The salad bar followed the same tune, cheap, nothing to mention, and very limited. Just as a bit of advise on Brasilian churrasco; please see below a list of what it should include. Not even going to mention what should be in the salad bar; or the fact that the side dishes left so much room for improvement. THEY are charging just slightly less than the big guys... try fogo de ch√£o.

I happened to have one (*gasp*) a couple of weeks later prepared by my Peruvian friend and - lemme tell you - the sight of them can be a little unsettling to the stomach. \\n\\nIn any case, the aforementioned Peruvian friend has emphasized that Peru doesn't really have an iconic dish aside from guinea pig. They really just pull from other culture's dishes and use their own ingredients. That being said, this restaurant certainly capitalizes off of people willing to paying more for 'exotic' sounding food. My curiosity was piqued though and the fact that I was able to make reservations with them through Opentable on Thanksgiving Day was also super convenient. \\n\\nSince this place was pricier than what we were used to, the S.O. and I decided to split the 3-course prix fixe meal they were offering on this special night. We selected the *Empanadas de Carne* for an appetizer (very filling, crunchy, and tasty), the *Seco a la Nortena*/ lamb shank for the main entree, and the *Alfajores*/ traditional Peruvian cookie for dessert. The lamb shank, I must admit, was ginormous and seasoned nicely. The side of rice and beans was very much appreciated. I was a little disappointed by the puny cookie for the dessert. This was basically caramel stuck in between two wafers then drizzled with powdered sugar. \\n\\nI was glad to have shared this dish and we were both extremely full from everything, even from the complimentary bread offered with the three (lackluster) sauces. I do wonder if the automatic 20% gratuity charge was applied due to the fact that it was Thanksgiving or simply because we had split the meal. In any case, the lamb shank was delectable, plus service was absolutely superb (like woah). 4-stars it is!"},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious!

We played bocce ball while we waited. One thing to note is that they have both bocce ball and horseshoes outside. Nice idea, but the sand for the horseshoes is everywhere... not unintentionally either. The bocce ball has to have gravel, so they made a huge wooden box for the gravel to stay in... the entire area however is covered in sand. I didn't understand why just the hoseshoe area would have sand and not have it just all over the place. No one liked the sand in their shoes, in the car, etc. It was just super unexpected. Another potential problem with the outdoor games was the horseshoes. Alcohol + throwing 2lbs of metal = danger. After a few drinks, my aim was off and I almost nailed someone at the other end. Super dangerous. Maybe ladder golf or cornhole would be better options...\\n\\nA lot of people had made reviews about the beer 'glasses.' What they may not have realized is that if you are inside, you get a real beer glass. If you tell them you plan to go outside, that is the only time that they will give you the plastic party cup.

I didn't think it was spectacular or particularly bad, just mediocre. \\n\\nThere were a lot of children running around at 10pm... which threw me off, but I guess it is a good place for families (besides the horseshoes, ha!)\\n\\nOverall, not bad, but not great."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place deserves 5 stars in the truest sense.

The seating situation was atrocious for my experience. My group had 5 people, one disabled. It was impossible to find seating together. I looked around, and there was no room at the communal tables, and I made a beeline for one of the just vacated separate tables. I got to the table and was looking at it and for a waiter to clean it when a woman ran over and sat at the table. She clearly saw me standing there, because she flashed a smile. I then turned to another table that was just vacated, and another girl hurriedly ran and plopped at a seat. Like, I'm here to eat pizza, not get my cardio workin or get into fisticuffs for a spot. What irked me was that most of the people sitting at these separate tables had groups of two. It's not like there wasn't space at the communal tables for two people. There just wasn't for 5. I guess this is a pizza parlor version of game of thrones. \\n\\nAnyway, after waiting quite some time, we managed to find enough room  to fit on one side of the communal table. Not exactly how I want to spend time while eating. We had to talk over strangers, who looked angry that we dare speak to one another. \\n\\nFor the record, I was looking for a spot that would accommodate my family member who was disabled. If there weren't so many people spread out, this would have been easy to find. \\n\\nWe did call ahead to see if they took reservations, but they do not. \\n\\nMy point is simple: A restaurant experience should not be stressful. It should not have to be game of thrones just to find a spot to sit. If they remedy this, then I will gladly give them five stars. \\n\\nTips:\\n- Only go during off peak hours when you have a group\\n- If your group is small, please use the communal tables instead of the separate tables if possible. \\n- The pizza is delicious, as is the beer. \\n\\nRecommendation for the restaurant: at least during peak hours, please have a server usher people to spots like they do at other restaurants with similar layouts."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Ridiculous, we walked in @5pm to a completely dead restaurant and we're told that maybe we could have a table of we were done by 6.

I wouldn't really say the chicken was fried; breaded, perhaps. But it was still good. The broccoli rabe helped cut the richness of the white sauce and chicken.\\n\\nThe patate was good, too, although our consensus was that it wasn't as good. It was just a lot richer--creamy, fatty, flavorful. That may have also been affected, though, by the fact that we'd each eaten 4 slices of pizza and a bunch of fries... I'd still recommend this pizza, just don't eat a ton at once, haha.\\n\\nAnd the fries were yummy, too! Crispy calamari on crispy fries with a drizzle of a acidic sauce that helped cut into the dish. Our only complaint was the poor coverage of the sauce. Perhaps tossing the fries and calamari in the sauce or having it on the side for dipping would allow for sauce to reach every bite.\\n\\nPrices were as you'd expect for a nice meal. I could see, though, the $4.50 big slices as a good lunch option, if you want something cheaper and faster.\\n\\nAll in all, a great meal with good service in a cool ambiance.

It feels like an almost less-kitchy version of eating in a Cracker Barrel.  Lots of old signs and rustic feel without feeling too put-on.  The service is quick and thorough, and the bathrooms were fairly clean given the big turnover as people were parading in and out during the lunch rush.\\n\\nThey don't have actually fried chicken, just fried chicken breast for sandwiches, so be forewarned if you're really looking forward to it.

The other premixed salads didn't seem very fresh or authentic and I was sad there weren't any hearts of palm.  But to be fair, it was meat nonstop.  Each meat was very well-seasoned and flavorful.  Some other places have a lot more variety which is why I feel like the price left a little to be desired."},{"name":"656 Sports Bar & Grille","address":"656 Pryor St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Waitresses are HORRIBLE!

Food is good and service is thorough but not overly intrusive. Happy Hour until 7pm and offers lots of food and drink discounts like $3 off house wine and side portions of pasta. Had the chicken Parmesan, side gnocchi, bread, and capers salad with prosciutto. Chicken pen quite good and more flaky than usual, which I prefer. Not overly cheesed and large portion. Cheese tasted fresh and sliced Parmesan on spaghetti really solid all in its own. Gnocchi again excels as chewy potato goodness in a palatable pink vodka sauce. Side portion a good size for $9 and worth a try to pass around the table. Bread a little underwhelming as it was a garlic bread variety with 4 slices rather than a loaf to dip into olive oil, as expected. Fine to start but not the best dipping mechanism considering the sauce is so good. Caprese salad a nice rendition and the meat really pulls it away. Loaded on top of the tomato and cheese, this is worth it on its own. Tomato and cheese fine, but a little wet. Open for brunch on weekends, dinner, and now lunch during the week. Wouldn't say this is going to win any dining awards, but if you want your classic Alitalia dishes with large portions in a relaxed environment, It's Italian could be the spot."},{"name":"Bistro Verde","address":"799 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Literally the slowest service I've ever experienced. \\nYou can see 20+ people noodling around and yet nothing gets done. \\nPainful experience."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Best pizza in Austin Texas coming from a New Yorker !!!!!!

I already can't wait for our next visit!!\\n\\nReservations are available through OpenTable, though you may not need one. I live nearby and it never seems to be too busy. The day of, the hostess called to confirm my reservation and asked for our preference regarding seating in the main dining room versus at the teppanyaki tables. I knew I'd be eating sushi so I opted for the main dining room, but she did advise that as long as most of the party is eating teppanyaki, you can order off the regular menu in the teppanyaki dining room as well. \\n\\nThere is a complimentary valet. \\n\\nWe over-ordered per usual and split two appetizers, two entrees, and two items from the sushi menu. I honestly enjoyed everything, and my BF - a notoriously picky eater - was also impressed. We left with a bag of leftovers that were just as good the next day. For two people including just one (AMAZING) cocktail each, the total bill was $115 before tip.\\n\\nWe tried the following: \\n\\nAPPETIZERS:\\n- WONTON TACOS ($8): four mini hard shell wonton tacos come per order, and you can choose either tuna or bulgogi or a combination for the fillings. The tuna is sushi grade and topped with guacamole and jicama slaw. It's a very light, summery combination of flavors. The bulgogi is beef (steak) tossed in gochujang and topped with jicama slaw. It's a much meatier mouthful. I preferred the tuna, and my BF preferred the bulgogi, but they were both good. Recommended! \\n- CRAB STICK FRIES ($7): the menu describes this one as \\"tempura kani, creamy ponzu, pop rocks\\" and it was served with a sesame-flavored miso-based sauce. I'm not sure how the pop rocks were incorporated. I certainly couldn't tell. This was a take it or leave it kind of dish for me... Just nothing too special about it despite the description. Wouldn't order again. \\n\\nENTREES\\n- CHICKEN ($17): the BF ordered the chicken hibachi, described as \\"natural chicken, candied carrot puree, local vegetables, balsamic teriyaki glaze\\" on the main dining room menu. All the hibachi entrees come with soup, salad, and a side of steamed white rice (which can be upgraded to fried rice). The soup and salad were pretty standard. The chicken dish itself was really tasty, and well-portioned. The local vegetables included zucchini, onion, bok choy, mushrooms, etc. Definitely recommended! \\n- HIBACHI FRIED RICE ($12): stir fried rice with soy, butter, egg and onion. We added chicken for another small upcharge. This came with a side of \\"yummy sauce\\" which was a spicy mayo-type creation. Delicious and would absolutely order again. \\n\\nSUSHI\\n- 50 SHADES ROLL ($22): lobster tempura, cream cheese, asparagus, crabstick, lobster claw, jalape√±o ponzu, lemongrass aioli, scallions. I ordered this one at the suggestion of the waitress and we both loved it. The lobster claw meat is absolutely delicious and tasted super-fresh. \\n- JG POKE ($14): tuna poke, avocado, creamy ponzu, and poke sauce. Delicious and so beautifully plated, but I would have been hungry if this is all I ordered. Portion was pretty small compared to the rest of the items we tried. \\n\\nCOCKTAILS: both were to die for!! \\n- BLACK HEART ($11): Bulleit bourbon, Combier creme d'cassis, lime, balsamic Reduction, blackberry, basil\\n- MORNING GLORY ($11): Square One cucumber vodka, elderflower liquer, lemon, cucumber garnish"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The worst manager I've ever seen. \\nI'm visiting Atlanta with my family and I've chosen this place using Yelp.

Home Slice Pizza was a solid place for thin slices that you fold.  Seems like my kind of place!\\n\\nWe visited Home Slice Pizza in South Congress for dinner, and on a Thursday night the place was pretty busy.  We were told that we'd have to wait half an hour, which we didn't mind; but fortunately, a table cleared within 10 minutes.  \\n\\nThe space is large enough, as the entire area serves as a dining area.  There's not much of a bar here.  But they do have alcohol, including prosecco cocktails.  I ordered the F'Heck Yeah prosecco cocktail, which is a sparkling wine base with a lemon Italian ice.  I do like prosecco, which mostly made up the drink; but I was surprised by how little of the lemon Italian ice came with.  It was mainly why I ordered it, so most likely wouldn't get it again, since the lemon Italian ice didn't do much for it.  I didn't taste much lemon flavor.  Not worth the nine bucks. \\n\\nBut the pizza was better.  Since they didn't do slices when we visited (it's only served after 9:30pm), my friend and I shared a large pie, and was able to try two kinds of pizza, as long as the base is the same.  Nice to know they have this option here.  Half of our pizza came with pepperoni and mushroom while the other half came with sausage, ricotta and red peppers.  \\n\\nThe pizza didn't take long to get, and of the two kinds, I enjoyed the sausage, ricotta and red peppers the most.  The ricotta added a nice element to it, a kind of creamy, sour flavor that complemented the saltiness from the sausage and roasted red peppers.  Add some sausage for protein and you have yourself a solid good slice of pizza.  I also liked that the crust was thin enough to fold, which is the quintessential characteristic of a Brooklyn-style pizza.  For the two of us, a large pizza was more than enough, so ended up talking half for leftovers.  \\n\\nI'm glad to have tried Home Slice Pizza, as Brooklyn-style pizza is my favorite kind.

I'm not saying this as a negative point, I'm saying it as a positive, because what I feel is the highlight of the sandwich are all the sauces! There are 3 different sauces used, but boy do they work well together! They blended together really nicely! Again, the freshness of the 4 veggies paired with the 3 sauces, YES, I recommend! \\nAnd again, you might think $12 is pretty pricey for a sandwich, but you get what you pay for in this case.

Anyways, the green peppers aside, the first obvious greatness of this sandwich was the bread. It was nice and warm and the sandwich itself was heated well. The tandoori chicken was incredibly well seasoned and I've mentioned this before in other reviews, that I like having a bit more sauce and this sandwich was no different. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they didn't put enough, I'm just saying they didn't put enough for *my personal preference*.

These past few weeks I haven't been too keen on doing this lately since there are zero shops remaining in Boston where you can sample in the store, and the staff lineup at my two previous favorite shops has changed and more often than I leave the store carrying negative energy from my conversations with condescending. elitist employees. Also, I almost always wind up with 1 or 2 flavors of E-Liquid, out of the 3-5 i bought that are absolute garbage. If your anything like me, (that is to say too friendly and too trusting), The employees rave about this juice and that juice and how they are the best they have so that you'll buy the sub-par product that no one else wants. I have experienced NONE, I repeat, NONE of these issues at The Vape Shop. I know they're fairly new so I went to check them out. The owner/boss, (his name is Jonathan i believe?) was super friendly recommended E-liquids I had never had before, and I picked a 3rd out of the rest of the selection. All 3 E-liquids are phenomenal, 3 for 3. He also introduced me to the UWell Valyrian. For the pat 3 years I have exclusively used Smok hardware. I still love their mods but after buying the Valyrian at The Vape Shop, I immediately ordered another Valyrian online and cleaned out/ retired (for now) my fleet of Smok tanks, both of my TFV8's, and a TFV12, ( I still run my TFV4 though because i honestly think the TFV4-Q4 coil are the best coils Smok has ever made). Had Jonathan not told me how good he thought the Valyrian was I would have never known what I was missing. The most important part for me is that I could tell he recognized I was a fairly experienced user without me having to say so, and because of that he didn't try to take advantage and never tried to upsell me, everything he told me in terms of his opinions of E-liquids, hardware was honest and 100% spot on.

Their chicken is hormone-free and probably one of the happiest chickens alive when it got the ax (not that I could tell the difference in taste, to be honest), but the real magic is in the breading. I don't know what spices they put in that breading, but it's got this zing that'll have you wishing you could order nothing but fried chicken skin. The waffle used to be wayyy bigger (circa 2012), so much so that you'd definitely need a to-go box, but even so, it's real healthy portion of goodness (although healthy is probably the wrong word to use here... heh). The honey butter is so good that you don't even need the syrup... but you should pour some on anyway because it's the freaking weekend.\\n\\nIf you're looking for something more on the breakfast side of brunch, I highly recommend the Frank O' American, which has your standard eggs of your style, hash, sausage links + a HUGE pancake.

Skip the Pulled Pork Hash because, while it's absolutely delicious, it probably won't fill you up (and it's like the most expensive thing on their menu). Last time I went, they had an off-menu Croque Monsieur, which was pretty bomb as well. I also used to plead with the waiting staff weekly to bring back the rotating off-menu omelette (I think they removed this around 2014), which, I swear was probably made up of at least 8 eggs + the best damn tater tots I've ever had.

It's really lovely with lots of brass accents and refurbished wood. Very trendy and definitely expected from a Ford Fry establishment.\\n\\nAs with all of Fry's Atlanta-based restaurants, service and attention to detail are paramount. \\n\\nLUNCH APPETIZERS\\nWe were disappointed to find out that these famous cheesy popovers are only served at dinner time. I'll have to come back and check them out then.\\n\\nWe started with a side of the corn muffins ($5). Fantastic. Sweet and crumbly and served warm with butter, the first bite took me back to my grandma's house as a child.\\n\\nThe Hushpuppies ($7 for four) are unique - in a really good way. This was my favorite of all the delicious appetizers. The Hushpuppies are served on a bed of sweet chili sauce and topped with country ham (which is cooked down so much I thought was just thick-cut sweet bacon pieces). Highly recommended. \\n\\nThe deviled eggs ($5 for two halved eggs) were beautifully garnished and presented in a small cast iron skillet. There weren't any weird takes on them, just normal deviled eggs. Definitely worth trying if you like deviled eggs but you won't be missing anything if you don't. \\n\\nFinally, we tried the Chili & Artichoke Dip ($8). It's baked in a cast iron skillet and a nice thick crust forms under the heat of the broiler. Served with pita chips (which I found a bit tough) but really yummy and a favorite at our table.\\n\\nLUNCH ENTREES\\nOne of my dining companions tried the Skuna Bay Salmon ($19), served with summer beans, king crab and tomato filleto (sauce). The salmon was cooked medium with a nice exterior texture. To my untrained eye it looked larger than a 4oz portion of salmon, but the plate itself was significantly smaller than the other dishes at the table. I believe it would be worthwhile to order some of the sharing sides to supplement this dish.\\n\\nThe Avocado Toast + Lobster ($19) was an enormous thick slab of bread topped with avocado, chunks of fresh lobster, and an absolute mountain of sprouts. Served with a lovely side salad of mixed lettuce and shaved vegetables. A very generous portion, and by far the best dish we tried today.\\n\\nThe Ploughman's ($15) was an excellent take on a very traditional lunchtime meal. If I had to find one thing to complain about it would be as silly as the toast being too thick to spread the tartare on."},{"name":"Victoria Seafood Restaurant","address":"1029 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"When I was at Boston College, we came to Victoria's once or twice a month, and it's the perfect place for a large group of people (I think we brought a group of close to 20 a few times) who don't want to spend too much money. \\n\\nTo reminisce old college times, we came to Victoria's again a few nights ago with a party of 11.

I really love the outdoor area here and it's definitely a fun place to grab a drink, hence the three stars.  But my most recent trip here for brunch was pretty bad.\\n\\nCon #1:  My sis-in-law asked about an obscure ingredient in one of the cocktails and the server couldn't answer her.  It took him about 10 minutes to get an answer for her.  When a restaurant is serving unique cocktails, it seems essential that the waitstaff understand the drink menu.  When I asked what the Smuttynose rotating draft was, he rattled off the name, gave me a sample but didn't tell me what it was like at all.  It ended up being a really spicy beer which shocked me when I took a sip.\\n\\nCon #2:  The food was not very good.  I got the egg and kimchi tacos.  They were totally bland.  The kimchi was basically cucumbers that were thrown in a sauce and the eggs had no flavor.  It was all topped with very flavorless \\"ramen noodles\\" which were essentially 10 hard bland sticks placed haphazardly on top.  There were two tacos in the order with no side, so I paid over $10 for something that should have cost $5.  My in-laws got the bluefish hash with poached eggs and both complained of how the hash contained almost no fish.  And this was after the server told us it was basically a lot of fish with a little bit of potato.  My husband got the french toast which seemed to be the only thing anyone enjoyed.  That being said, it was one piece of french toast for a hefty price tag.  He also ordered the \\"maple bacon\\" on the side which was a significant amount of bacon for $5, but there was nothing \\"maple\\" about it.\\n\\nCon #3:  Why the hell was there cabbage on everyone's plate as a side?  The server made it sound like it was a chef special \\"slaw\\".  It was literally a piece of cabbage, raw, taking up half the plate.  It looked like it was there to fill dead space since the portions were so small.\\n\\nOverall, an extremely disappointing experience.

It's a neighborhood hangout.  The restaurant has many TVs and carries several sports stations (aside from the main ones like ESPN), so it works well as a sports bar.  There's also an outdoor patio.\\n\\nIt's a small place, often busy and sometimes crowded.  It's located next door to Verde Taqueria, which was the old Fox & Hounds space.  Big Easy's parking lot is small and most of times, full.  Parking can be a pain during peak times.  Other parking spots can be found along Collier.  If parking on the street, be careful crossing.\\n\\nBig Easy Grille is named after the city of New Orleans' nickname, \\"The Big Easy.\\"  The business is reminiscent of many of the small bars and restaurants found in NOLA's French Quarter or along Bourbon Street.  So I guess you could say it's just another bar, except it's decorated in all things New Orleans and Louisiana such as a fleur-de-lis on the wall (most people recognize it as the Saints logo) and LSU paraphernalia.\\n\\nI've found the Cajun and Creole food here to be pretty good.  Some dishes are better than others.  They serve just about everything you'd find in southern Louisiana including alligator, catfish, shrimp, crawfish, crab, fried oysters, and andouille sausage.  There's gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, etouffee, po-boy sandwiches, and even beignets.  The menu is reasonably priced with most entrees each $12 or less.  I recommend visiting for their Sunday New Orleans Brunch (Sundays, 12 to 3).\\n\\nThe oyster po-boy is delicious.  It consists of flash-fried Gulf oysters, creole mayo, shredded lettuce, and sliced tomato inside French bread with a tiny slice of lemon on the side.  The baguette is soft and appetizing.  What makes this sandwich are the fresh, sometimes plump Gulf oysters and the addicting creole mayo.  It's a very good and filling sandwich, one that I recommend.\\n\\nThe chicken and sausage gumbo is also very good.  The bowl is served near piping hot and is filled with chunks of chicken, andouille sausage, rice, and assorted vegetables.  It's tasty, hearty, and satisfying.  If you're in the mood for soup, definitely try the gumbo.  Lots of flavor.  You can get a small cup or a bowl.\\n\\nThe jambalaya is OK.  Not my favorite, but not bad either.  It consists of andouille sausage, chicken, vegetables, and red peppers blended with white rice.  It's a little dry and bland compared to the other dishes.  I'd probably steer towards a different side like the Cajun fries or etouffee.\\n\\nIf you come for brunch, order the alligator omelet.  It consists of a two-egg omelet stuffed with alligator sausage, mushroom, and onion.  It's topped with shredded cheese.  The portion size is generous and the filling is savory.  I like to eat the omelet with hot sauce.  Hot sauces available at each table include Trappey's Louisiana Hot Sauce (one I used to eat growing up) and the thicker Bayou Pecker Powder.  They both go great with eggs.\\n\\nThe omelet comes with a piece of plain toast and a side, fresh fruit or cheese grits.  I've tried both.  The fruit consists of a small bowl of sliced cantaloupe, strawberries, and blueberries.  They are indeed fresh, ripe, and sweet.  The cheese grits consist of a small bowl of plain grits topped with shredded cheese, the same cheese that is used on top of the omelets.  Mix the cheese into the grits while the grits are still hot.  It's not bad.\\n\\nService is good.  Food comes out from the kitchen relatively quick and the servers are polite and attentive.\\n\\nAside from the parking and jambalaya, I think Big Easy Grille is a solid neighborhood joint and a good place to get your Cajun and Creole fix.

Bad service spoiled the night out. \\n\\nWe ordered the Margherita pizza, the Salami pizza and an arugula salad. The salad and the Margherita came out together after a very long wait. The Margherita had great promise but was already cold. The Salami pizza came out later and was still warm and gave us a flavor of how the pizza would taste out of the oven. The crust was delicious and not over burnt while there was a good balance of toppings and sauce. They also offered sparkling red wines which were interesting and can be hard to find. \\n\\nMy positive comments start and end at the food. We waited for a more than ten minutes once seated to talk to someone and were not given menus. I asked for hot water or tea which they said they had no way of preparing. We did not see our server throughout the meal and he never asked if we wanted more drinks and brought the bill without asking if we wanted dessert or more food. I could go on and on here but I think you get the point. Honestly, we would have had a nicer experience just eating at the bar. \\n\\nThis place is doing a lot of take out and they seem to have made that a priority over the sit down customers. Let's hope the service improves to match the food. Until then, be careful if this is your night out!\\n\\nOther things to add: the restaurant does not offer a cheap (five dollar or less) draft beer which is something I sometimes like to order instead of a craft beer and they made the odd choice of playing 90's hip hop.

Since it was my first time, they gave a small side of Pot Likker and a crackling (?) corn bread. Love the hospitality! I went with the fried chicken (3 legs) with cheese grits and fried green tomatoes. Got an order of the Georgia Peach Cobbler as well. \\n\\nPot Likker and cornbread: it's a light soup but the flavor is good. I really wish I got this as a side instead but the waitress suggested another side since I was getting this for free. The cornbread was also pretty good. I couldn't really tell but I think there was pork rinds cooked into the cornbread? \\n\\nFried chicken meal: comes with a tray of dinner rolls, corn bread and cinnamon rolls. 6 total even though it was a table for one. It was all way too much food! The drumsticks were large and crispy. The fried green tomatoes were kind of greasy but delicious. I couldn't even finish the cheese grits. Nothing special about it though. \\n\\nPeach Cobbler: decent size but at this point I was so full. My favorite part was definitely the crust on the top.

It was a pretty lousy experience and reminded me of the Massachusetts DMV in the 1990s. Imagine chaos, tons of people, unclear rules, long lines, and the sense of being punished as I failed to secure a couch. This was my third time there so I thought that I had understood the rules. Learn from my mistakes:\\n\\n1. Show up 60-90 minutes before the showing. Parking is extremely limited. \\n2. As you approach the theater, there will be a ridiculous line pouring out into the hallway. You may want to sneak into the inner room and see where that line leads. It's either for the bar or for the movie. Remember, your objective is to secure a couch. If the line is to get into the theater, GET INTO THIS LINE! Plan on being pushed, over-crowded, being cut, and having your personal space invaded. You will be able to pay for your admission (a stamp on the inner wrist) with cash or credit card.\\n3. Sidenote: If you're seeing an evening movie, it will be a 21+ only crowd. Since alcohol is being served, EVERYBODY will be carded whether or not you drink alcohol. It's an Oregon law. Because of that, you can't buy \\"tickets\\" for someone else who isn't present. That person needs to be present to show his/her ID during the purchase of admission. Don't be that wanker who complains, \\"I just wanna buy a ticket for a friend...he's on his way...what do you mean I can't buy his ticket...I just want to complain and waste everybody's time...\\" \\n4. Once you get inside, it will be just like that scene in \\"Far and Away\\" when land is up for grabs. Quickly run to ANY couch and secure it with an article of clothing, baby, or service animal. This is NOT a time to be picky. Any couch is better than no couch - trust me. Your arse will thank you for it. I'm still nursing my 3-day old pressure ulcer from the solo chairs in back.\\n5. At this point if you're hungry or thirsty, you can safely head to the bar. You've \\"reserved\\" your couch with that clothing/baby/service animal. If social norms still apply, hopefully a stranger isn't sitting in your couch and wearing your jacket when you return. Drinks can be ordered and brought to your seat. Food will take ridiculously long and you will be given a number to stick on your couch. Hopefully the servers can find your number in the dark during the movie. (Another reason why the solo chairs stink, the bent plastic thing with your number doesn't stay easily on the back of the chair.)\\n6. If you decide first to eat the mediocre food at McMenamin's, then the entire experience will be easier. You will be there at least 2 hours before the showing, had secured parking, and bought your \\"tickets\\" well in advance. You can get into that evil line early and get into pole position. In front of the line, you will have more couches to choose from. \\n\\nI can't wait to go back in 4-6 months. $3 for a movie is such a great deal."},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Visited this place on a triple date night with friends...Either their AC was broken or they don't have AC so I was dying from heat!

We came at 7:45 pm on a saturday and the place was packed - I'd definitely recommend booking a reservation beforehand.\\n\\nThe menu was filled with a bunch of words that we couldn't really understand (I'll include english translations for all the fancy peruvian terms) so we asked the waitress what she would recommend. She suggested getting 3 tapas + 1 entree, or 2 entrees and 1 tapas for 2 people and recommended the scallops, ceviche and purple potato. Andina specializes in peruvian tapas, so we ended up getting 4 tapas & 1 entree: We got the palta rellena de cangrejo (avo with crab and prawn), carne empanada, conchas a la parrilla (grilled diver scallops with fried onions), langostinos amelcochados (panko crusted prawns), and lomo saltados (beef tenders).\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised by the avocado dish-though maybe that's not really a surprise since I love everything avo related. It was served cold and came with a side salad; it was a nice & light dish to start off the meal with and the crab and prawn complimented the richer flavors of the avocado perfectly. I do have to say that it was a really simple dish that I could probably recreate myself though. Another one of our favorites was the lomo saltado: while the fries weren't anything special and a bit bland, the beef was super tender and I loved that they were bite sized. The scallops were also amazing - they had a deep smokey flavor and I loved that the fried onions served as mini onion rings! \\n\\nHowever, the empanadas and the prawns weren't that great. The prawns were fried a bit too heavily, and mostly just tasted like nicely fried dough and the empanadas had a strange sterile taste to them - would definitely not recommend.\\n\\nOverall, andina's dishes are kind of a hit or miss: they had some pretty good dishes but everything else was a bit too simple or just underwhelming. The food did come super fast, the first dish arriving 10mins after we ordered and everything else coming steadily one after another, and the wait staff were very attentive and helpful. The prices were also very reasonable (came out to $80 for 4 tapas & 1 entree) but this probably wouldn't be one of my go-to spots to hit."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We went to this restaurant on a Saturday at 1pm.

Justin (our server), the atmosphere, the zucca + coffee drink, their baked oysters, and the egg tamale dish were great. The rest, not so much.\\n\\nI'd been wanting to come here for a while now and my brother coming in town to visit from Chicago seemed like the perfect time to give it a try. We started with their baked oysters which are on their bar snacks menu. They were excellent and their homemade mignonette on top with the cheddar cheese made for a delicious bite slurp.\\n\\nWe each did their three course prix-fixe menu sharing all 6 of our choices. We had:\\n\\nSunchoke Flan with Orange. Roasted Fennel, Miso Caramel, and Chicory\\n--Really tasty with great textures.\\n\\nSoft Egg Tamale with Mushroom Ragu and Goat Cottage Cheese\\n--This dish ruined me for the rest of the meal. I am absolutely in love with it and could have had 8 plates of it by itself. It was packed with flavor from all angles. Deep, rich, just an incredible dish. I could happily bath in the mushroom ragu.\\n\\nBowfin Caviar with Smoked Fish, Egg, Beet, Horseradish, Avocado, and Nori\\n--This was pretty good and I felt it tasted like Japan.\\n\\nCoppa Ham with Stewed Pecans / Braised radish / Pasilla Pur√©e\\n--This by far was our least favorite. It was way too salty and not an enjoyable experience to eat. There was nothing redeeming about this dish whatsoever. I'm not one to waste food so I ate my portion completely. I wasn't very happy about it though.\\n\\nButtermilk Rabbit with Ras El Hanout Potatoes, Snow Peas, and Green Garlic\\n--I'm a big sweet potato fan, but for some reason, I didn't feel the flavor fit well with the rabbit. However, everything else separate from the sweet potato went perfectly together and was a nice hearty game stew near it's finest.\\n\\nConfit Goat with Winter Vegetables, Beet mole, Charred Scallion Cr√®me Fra√Æche, and Pea Shoot Salad\\n--Only one bite was tender, fatty, juicy, and flavorful. The rest was a bit dry and not impressive.\\n\\nWould I come again? Definitely! Would I stear clear from half the dishes ordered on this visit? Definitely! I loved the small bistro/home style decor, the cooks were really nice, service excellent, and dishes creative. I'm also pretty sure that pretty much all their ingredients are sourced from local farms and their menu changes every now and again.

If you know me as a Yelper, I basically NEVER give 1 stars, because first I'm pretty positive about all establishments that put in some effort, and I also have very low standards for food (like it doesn't take a lot to impress me, my friends constantly criticize me for loving bottom-shelf alcohol and thinking bad pho tastes amazing!).\\n\\nA little background - the concept of Kennedy school is really awesome - it's an old elementary school repurposed into a hub of different rooms that consist of bars, a gift shop, a hotel-like place where you can stay, a restaurant, a movie theater (cheap tickets actually, would recommend). \\nOther positives of this place are that it's really fun to explore the school if you're new to Portland, parking is free (which is not true of other McMenamins that you want to go to).\\n\\nI had been here 2-3 times during my few months in Portland and I didn't think it was bad - the outdoor restaurant area (it's in the biggest room in the school) serves pretty good Cajun tots for a decent price and a hefty amount, the beer is similar to other McMenamins.\\n\\nHowever, I had one experience here that really made me not want to come back ever again. I'm Asian American and when I get bad service, I rarely attribute it to my being a person of color - but this experience was so bleh that I'm almost 100% sure it's because of the ethnicity of my group of friends.\\n\\nSituation:\\nWe arrive at the front of the restaurant and it's pretty obvious that we're in line before other people that arrive after us. We get seated in a booth (there's 5 of us, and it's a very racially diverse group of people - 2 latinos, 2 Asians, 1 white dude). Shortly after we get seated, a group of 5 white people about our age also get seated like one table away from us.\\n\\nWe get our menus around 7:15pm, but it takes our waiter like 30 minutes (not exaggerating) to come back to take our order (meanwhile, the white group 5 feet away from us has already ordered and drinks are already out for them). The waiter walks by multiple times and we attempt to make eye contact. I even raise my hand once to tell him we're ready to order. He says \\"I'LL BE RIGHT THERE\\" but another 15 minutes goes by and he doesn't come back to check on us. By the time we actually order, it's like maybe 7:50pm. We get pretty standard burgers (I got the dungeon burger, it was okay - I usually like the Cajun tots that come with it but other than that it wasn't that impressive).\\nOur white waiter tells us that food might take a while, so we're like okay. We legit don't get our food until like 8:40pm. When our food comes, we preemptively ask for more ketchup because we all love ketchup, and we know that our waiter probably won't come back to check up on us for the next hour - so we're just looking out for ourselves. His response was a sassy \\"THERE'S KETCHUP ON YOUR PLATES\\" (because there was a small cup of ketchup that came with our fries/burgers). My friends are like..okay.... well we're going to use it so can we get more?...this guy was literally so rude! Meanwhile, that group of white friends is basically done with their meal and is getting ready to go. Also to top this whole experience - I ordered cajun tots but they didn't give me cajun tots, they gave me regular tots - and I didn't even bother trying to get this fixed because I knew our waiter would probably take 100 yrs.\\n\\nThere were so many times throughout this night where we heavily debated just dipping out because our waiter was walking by us without responding to us, the food took forever, and he made no efforts to acknowledge us at all. There was literally no difference between my group of friends and the other group of white friends other than our race (like we were literally all around the same age, my friends and I didn't look sketch and we weren't dressed poorly either, we were literally just a diverse group of friends looking for a good meal). \\n\\nHere on Yelp I've read some other people post reviews about them having really bad service too, and that makes me super sad because this place has potential to literally be so great because the concept is so cool. Unfortunately I'm probably never coming back again, even though they should freaking thank us because we upped the diversity in that restaurant room by like 90% when we walked in -_-"},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is my second visit to TWO Urban Licks and this time around it was pretty amazing.

We don't see a lot of HOTD in So-Cal, so trying this brewery's gems were a breath of fresh air. \\n\\nThis place is easily accessible via the Downtown Portland bus #15, just take it over the Morrison Bridge and hop off on the first exit at the top/end of the bridge. Seems sketchy that you are on a bus stop on top of the bridge, but there are stairs which take you down to the street level and you are about 1 street North West of the brewery. HOTD is totally visible from the top of the bus stop, to the bottom of the stairs, so you can't get lost. It is a big brown industrial building.  The brewery is big, open, clean, and vibrant in colors (teals, greens, etc) which really put me in a hoppy (get it, happy?) mood. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar and started off with the \\"Walk the Dog\\" tasting flight for $12. You get six 3oz tasters of Greg, Blue Dot, Fred, Adam, Doggie Claus, and Fred from the Wood. I felt like a little slut here. \\"Oh I'll try Fred.. Oh now I'll try Adam, mmm he is nice and dark.. Oh Greg you are so smooth.. And Fred you taste so much better aged..\\" All of these beers exceeded my expectations (even though I felt a little whore-ish trying these beers named after men) and I must say the Fred from the Wood (aged for 6 months) was just a trip drinking it vertically with Fred. I also liked Greg and Adam, and Doggie Claus. \\n\\nSince this place is within walking distance of Green Dragon and the soon to be Cascade Barrel House, stop by this place on your beer-adventure!"},{"name":"M√≠ Casa Market","address":"11700 Dessau Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I finally went and adventured to this store.

Pieces of food on EVERY PLATE kind of dirty. A few of us went around to the omelet station to grab plates, and while cleaner, they were still dirty. We made due with the cleanest plates we could find and told our server. When we went to get more food at least 10 minutes later, the same dirty plates were still on the buffet. \\n\\nThe food was okay, but the presentation was terrible. The ravioli was dry and looked like a frozen dinner. The tables were dirty with dripping food, and every single serving utensil was caked with food. There was a big container of maple syrup, which the server told us was for French toast, but there was no French toast the entire time we were there. Not only that, there was not any bread for an Easter brunch buffet. No rolls, no toast, no bagels, none at all. What kind of brunch (especially one that is supposed to be half Italian) has no bread?!? \\n\\nI ordered coffee, and guess what? The mug had food crusted on the outside!! When we got dessert, those plates, while at least dry, had a dirty film on them. Our dirty plates were not cleared quickly, which for a buffet is pretty much the only thing you're paying gratuity for. \\n\\nFor $30 a plate (plus added 20% gratuity!) I feel ripped off, but to top the entire meal off, when we got our check, we were charged for 2 extra plates, which with the added gratuity came out to almost $75. \\n\\nI had never been to this restaurant prior to this, and while I have heard good things, I will never go back.

I really wish that I could get this chicken in the area of the country that I come from. Don't get me wrong, we do have some good fried chicken places, but none as good as this close by. I wish I could just have some of it shipped here. The spiced apples were a hit too. They had the right amount of flavor and did not remind me of apple pie at all. The spiced apples had their own flavor profile that I enjoyed. The okra was good too. It wasn't overly fried, which is when it gets hard too eat okra. The okra also wasn't under-fried either, it was just perfect. Another item that we got to try was called 'pot likker' which was the stock used for their collard greens with cornbread. Man, if collard greens could always taste like that broth did, I would be eating them all the time. Alas, that is not always the case and now I want that recipe for the pot likker. It didn't taste bland or just spinach water. It had some seasoning in it. It had some flavor. I would order that next time. I almost forgot the hushpuppies! How could I forget those? They were so light and fluffy and tasted like a hushpuppy with nothing extra in it. I ate them up like nobody's business. I haven't had good hushpuppies in years, so of course, I'm going to love this. \\n\\nThe server was amazing too.

Voodoo is probably the most sought after, with countless TV plugs and magazine hits, it benefits uniquely from it's seedy downtown location and weirdo reputation.\\n\\nDoughnuts with a twist is one way to describe them.

We all really enjoyed our meals; however it was hot as heck in there and this was before we even got our meals that we noticed how hot it was. Not sure if it was because of the ratio of space to people in the restaurant that was causing the lack of A/C. We would have been cooler dining outdoors with at least the breeze. \\n\\nWhat we ordered:\\n- SPICY CHICKEN RAMEN (mild): my friend really enjoyed her ramen. She said it's the best she's ever had and that is coming from someone who doesn't really like ramen at all.\\n- SPROUTING UP RAMEN: if you say Brussel sprouts, I'm sold. They added a nice crisp and crunch component to this bowl of ramen. I also enjoyed the crunch from the kikurage (wood ear mushroom). What really stood out to me is the thick noodles and I'm totally a fan! The broth is also not too salty unlike most ramen places which I'm really grateful for\\n- CHA CHA CHA RAMEN: got to try a bit of my boyfriend's ramen, and I must say, you can really taste the garlic. They also give you extra garlic with a masher so that you can add more garlic flavors to your dish. Personally, too much garlic for my liking but my boyfriend really enjoyed it.\\n\\nDrinks: they have a drink menu that includes beer, sake, and a speciality cocktail.\\n- STIEGL: look no more though. Under their speciality cocktail menu, is this grapefruit soda beer. Seriously the best tasting beer I've ever had. So good we suggested it to our dining neighbor and she googled it and it says that it's supposed to be really healthy for you! Whatever it is, it's pretty tasty and refreshing with your hot bowl of ramen.\\n\\nOverall, I do see myself frequenting this spot more. The downside is that it's so popular that it seems like there's always a long wait. Plus the spot is so, so small. \\n\\nSome Other Tidbits:\\n+ They don't take reservations, best to just come in and check in with the front. They will call you when your table is ready.\\n+ Where's the A/C at?

I was sent to the catering director, who wanted to have us do menus and contracts, and I explained this was an informal birthday party where everyone would be paying for themselves. His suggestion was to just hang out in the bar. I said again, I wanted to be on the patio. I decided to just book a table for 8 online using opentable and called the hostess again to request the outside area which she said should be fine as it was a Thursday night and they only showed one other large party with reservations. All reservations noted this was a birthday. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we hung out in the bar till everyone in the party arrived and we were a little early. At our arrival it started to sprinkle a little. So they were taking all the patio tables down. I inquired if they might open it back up because it was obvious this was a sprinkle and they said maybe. The hostess showed me the table we would get if not. It fit exactly 8 and was a booth. I explained what happens if a couple extra people show? She said it's all I can do. Meanwhile, the place had maybe 1/4 of the tables full. It was a ghost town. So I was beside myself trying to understand why we were being pushed to this one table as a choice. I said, let's wait a minute to see if the rain stops. In about 15 min the rain did completely clear and I approached again to ask about the patio. The hostess said she needed to check with her manager, who finally but reluctantly said okay. Then, they weren't going to seat us because we were missing 2 people from the party who were stuck in traffic. I said, please, we will start our meals and not wait for them. The place was still about 1/4 full, so I didn't get the problem. \\n\\nThey again reluctantly sat us, and at the time we were the only people on the patio. But finally, I was in the spot I had requested from the start. Mind you there are like 20 tables on the patio. All empty. \\n\\nOur waiter was good, he knows his menu and did a great job of explaining everything.  I wouldn't describe him as a warm personality though. I am\\nquite positive a smile never erupted from his face the entire time. \\n\\nWe had salmon chips (outstanding), Pork Belly (great taste), and brisket Empanadas for starters. The wine list is good and they serve a lot of their wines draft style which is interesting. I like that you could get different sizes and prices were within reason. Food is definitely at the high end, meals are $25-35, so it will add up fast. But the quality of the food was good and if you get the Brisket for example, as my husband did, portion is huge. \\n\\nI do want to note, no one wished my husband a Happy Birthday. No song sung, no dessert given. No attention to the occasion at all. So for that, I am a little bummed. He had a \\"It's my Birthday Sash\\" on and everything. \\n\\nMy overall feelings of my first visit here is that this is a place I may come to once a year. I didn't feel overwhelming excited about it, the consistent problems they kept making about catering to a birthday and a group of 8 was mind-boggling. The place never was full and had plenty of tables empty the entire evening, so I didn't understand the we can't do this or can't do that. At the end of the day, you are in business to help people have a good time at your establishment and in the case of a birthday, make it special, and memorable. Even the decent food can't make up for the annoyance I still feel at how hard they made it to just let us sit with our group on the patio. \\n\\n\\nI definitely will not have an event there. Maybe just a dinner for 2. \\n\\nI thought the parking was fine, I know some people complained about it. It wasn't easy to find where to be but valet was nice and probably the most welcoming people on the property."},{"name":"La Hacienda Mexican Restaurant","address":"2260 S Volusia Ave","city":"Orange City","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for lunch. Sunday afternoon around 130pm. Restaurant was very busy, but no wait for a seat. We were given chips and salsa, and then waited a few minutes for a server. The decor is ok, but honestly the restaurant could use a deep cleaning. It's not that it was dirty, but it seemed a bit greasy.  The server was very friendly and attentive. I ordered a 32 ounce beer, my wife a lemonade. Beer was delivered on a freezing cold much, and stayed cold the entire time we were there. Of course, I ordered cheese dip for the chips. For food, I got the texana fajitas consisting of chicken, steak, shrimp, peppers, onions, squash, mushrooms. And sides of refried beans, lettuce, and rice. I declined the guacamole, sour cream, and pico de Gallo. My wife got chicken enchiladas. Food was served on time and hot. Very large portions. Chicken great, steak great, shrimp, a bit overcooked. My wife enjoyed her enchiladas. We left full and happy! \\nOverall, if you want a good affordable Mexican meal,  this restaurant will not disappoint.

The fried clams were tender, crispy and delish.  My only complaint was they come on top of the fries - which makes everything a little soggy.  But next time I would have them place them separately.

You see, my grandma has limited mobility on her own and when we take her to lunch, we like to go somewhere close to her  (Assembly Square). We typically go to Legals on the Mystic around the corner #should'vestucktowhatweknow, but my mother and I thought it would be nice to take her to a new spot,  sit outside and have a view of the water. I had heard good things about River Bar, the menu looked interesting, and we were excited to try a new spot! \\nFirst let me begin with a couple positives. The location is beautiful and the margaritas that we had were really delicious. The bartenders working that day seemed professional and happy to be there. The bathroom was super clean as was the rest of the restaurant. There was one waiter (who did not serve us) who assisted us in leaving with a wheelchair and he was happy to do so! \\nWe were greeted by a hostess who seemed like our arrival to this restaurant was the equivalent to receiving news that her beloved childhood Golden Retriever \\"Rusty\\" had to be put down. She mustered the strength to show us to a great water-view table and also helped navigate a wheelchair there and I shook it off as, 'hey maybe she's having a bad day.' However, the entire lunch I observed the staff working there including her and she was happily giggling and smiling on her phone for the majority of our lunch. I'm not saying a host has to be Tigger, but a smile and a little upbeat-ness goes a long way in that role..sometimes the host is the first impression of the restaurant and in this case, the initial interaction made me want to high tail it to Legals. \\n(Note: there were a members of the staff who seemed professional and happy to do their job, the rest were like the Bergens in the movie Trolls *If you don't understand that reference here is a video clip to help* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClPZ_0_2Xxk Anyways, they were like the Bergens)\\n\\nThe second person was our waiter. He was fine enough until I tried the sangria and had to send it back. #cringeworthy..I have to say I can name 2 times I sent back a drink. 1 Was when I went Stephanie's on Newbury before seeing the Nutcracker and I failed to realize the margarita had ghost tequila in it so I apologized and asked for something else. The second was this time.\\n\\nBefore I discuss the sangria, I have a big old disclaimer. I am about to do that thing when people talk about how they traveled somewhere and tried something delicious that the place is known for and now they are an expert on said thing and this current thing they are having pales in comparison #gottaspeakmytruth. I bet whoever is reading this (if they still are)is rolling their eyes and saying \\"Let me guess you studied abroad in Spain\\" and you, my friend, would be correct. I did study in Spain and had some of the best sangria of my life and unfortunately the one place in Boston that came close to that sangria has since closed its doors. #MISSYOUTAPEO..\\n\\nNow I recognize River Bar is not a strictly Spanish restaurant so I wasn't expecting the sangria to be award worthy..I wasn't going into this thinking 'this sangria is going to turn me into flamenco dancer Carmen Amaya twirling and stomping on a plaza in Barcelona'... but I did expect it to be drinkable..it wasn't. To me, it tasted like someone melted a crayola crayon (and not a pretty one like cerulean blue) and used it as the sangria base. It was waxy, smoky, and tasted like scotch. Now as someone who makes her own sangria, I know everyone has their different opinions about which wine to use, which brandy, which fruit, other alcohol, juices, etc. But the flavor combo of whatever was in the sangria made me have to send it back. But I wanted to know what was in it! So I told the waiter that I really didn't like it and that it tasted like it went bad. I also asked what they used to make it. I heard some standard ingredients in his reply and them my mother chimed in and said \\"Maybe the wine was corked?\\" OK NOW...his face when my mother said that also resembled the face of the hostess when we walked in..Like Rusty was meeting his fate AGAIN. He was defensive, unapologetic, and didn't even ask if I wanted something else so I had to ask awkwardly for a margarita. If there is a positive in this, I guess this waiter is real loyal to River Bar and will defend it whole-heartedly.\\nThe last thing I will discuss is the food. We ordered a bunch of items to share and there are some positives here. The shrimp skewers and arugula salad were really tasty. The other items actually made my mother and I feel sick. I don't want to YUCK the YUM of others reading this so I will not include what we ordered, but one of the items I ate made me wanted to run, nay BOLT to Legal's order the Legal Sangria and a crab roll and chalk up this experience as a big ole L."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been to a great many taco places, and the Ocoee Taco Company greatly impressed with their family recipes, excellent salsa, and varied options. \\n\\nBesides tacos, I accepted the recommendation of the Shrimp Quesadilla, and it was, in a word, spectacular!

Many of the dishes are classic, but have a bit of a spin to them. Some of these \\"spins\\" spin the flavors of the food way out of control. I had the flat iron steak which was cooked well, but the flavors were not all there. On the other hand, we tried some sort of salmon dish which tasted great. I think depending on when you go it could be a hit or miss honestly.\\n\\nWhat really makes me want to come back to this place is the vibe. It has a very cool and calming trendy atmosphere going for it. This place would be a perfect date spot or a night out with the friend, but it might be awkward for the Mommy or Daddy's bday.\\n\\nOverall I'll give this place a 3.5/5, but round it up to a 4.

The Captain Crunch one was topped with an incredibly sweet white frosting and Captain Crunch and berries cereal. The actual doughnut was soft and fluffy, but we could not finish it because of all the sugar. Talk about sugar high! The bacon maple doughnut was hands down our favorite of the bunch. The flavor of the maple frosting with the bacon were a perfect match and wasn't as sweet as the Captain Crunch one. \\n\\nI've had better tasting doughnuts, but this place has a cool vibe that comes with it.

That's would be fine as that would be a pretty much a standard for a good and legit ramen joint.. if I enjoyed the food more.  They probably can fit a little less than 20 patrons at a time, included a small bar near the kitchen.  Despite that, definitely on par with one of the smallest ramen restaurants in Boston, maybe slightly bigger than Pikaichi.  However, we had no trouble finding seats.. flagging the first red flag about the ramen.\\n\\nSecond, ramen selection.  It's minimal, almost laughable.  I know it's an opening menu (3 types of ramen, one cold appetizer), but even looking at the size of the kitchen and the staff, I'm not sure if they'll even be able to handle an expanded menu.  Time will tell I guess, and I would give this place another shot once that happens.\\n\\nThird and most importantly, the actual ramen.  I ordered the Shoyu (soy) while the gf got the miso.  The noodles were moderately okay, not the best but not the worst.  They were chewy, but were fairly bland.  The meat toppings, being mostly ground/pulled pork, was fairly disappointing - to me, this makes it more of a Chinese style rather than Japanese (gimme my sliced, fatty pork any day!).  Mind you, the ground/pulled pork wasn't tasteless, and you could always add extra sliced pork.. but at a base price of 11-13, things could start to get pricy when you start paying for extra additions.  Luckily, the Miso came with sliced pork, so I was able to steal a piece from my GF to try.. but again, disappointed.  No fat.  Meat wasn't even that tender, and was again, pretty bland.  \\n\\nThe rest of the toppings were minimal, and the soup base wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.

Calamari was the favorite. For dinner, salmon was popular as well as mussels and the lobster Mac and cheese. I think the lobster is a bit hard to find but the portions are large! I enjoyed the fried chicken with lobster Mac. There was a bit of fried kale for garnish on top which was delicious! The fried chicken was crispy and juicy. \\n\\nI say all this to say yes the food is good, but it's not unique and you can enjoy a relaxed meal of equal or better quality at equal or cheaper prices without the stress. \\n\\nEven parking is a hassle. Piedmont doesn't have much street parking. You can try the side roads but who knows what happens there. Uber or Lyft are your best bets.

About 5 later a server walked by and after catching her attention she proceeded to take our order but appeared to be new, that's fine too. We're patient. However, it grew short quickly. After about 45 minutes we had to track down or server because she never can to check on us or give us the status of our order. She finally brought out our food, appetizer with the entree, we still won't complain cause we're ready to eat. The food was cold. My cheese steak dry, it took her forever to bring mayo, calamari, not sauce... My onion rings were warm though. So, I complained to the manager, she didn't seem very helpful initially. So, I sent my cold food back and requested hot food. In the meantime, my friend discover that his chicken BLT didn't come with the bacon or the guacamole that it was supposed to. He are it without complaint because he was hungry. While I waited on my for I requested a container because by that time it had been over an hour and i was on my lunch break. She finally returns with the receipt with only his order. Where's my food? Please get the manger again. The manger states that she was told I didn't want the food. HOW? No ma'am, I do. Chicken Philly with onions and peppers. 15 minutes later my server, bless her heart, brings me wings and fries. Ummm, what is this?? Wrong person. About another 5 minutes later here's my calamari, 10 minutes later, here's my cheese steak (still no mayo) and onion rings. So, how was the food? Calamari a little salty. Cheese steak, no peppers like I surgically specifically asked but it and the onion rings were OK. Needless to say, I was highly disgusted with the entire experience but at least they didn't charge me. The facility is a nice place, hookahs at every table and quite a few TVs.

I sat at the separate oyster bar and we ordered off the menu there. Our bar tender was cordial, but sort of very serious and was strangely quite personality-free. I ordered the peel-n-eat Royal Red shrimp. Royal Reds come from the deep waters of the Gulf and usually are only available in the coastal resort towns in the region). The shrimp served to me were not Royal Reds. They were also completely covered with about a cup of dry seafood boil spice mix over the top. I have never seen cold shrimp served like this. Not only was it impossible to peel the shrimp with all this mess, the flavor was overwhelmed by dry spice. We sampled some raw oysters at $2.50 or $3.00 each depending on East or West Coast source. That's expensive for oysters, even in land-locked Atlanta. We sampled the sausage stuffed squid body as well. It was stuffed with a very spicy sausage meat that completely over powered the squid. The thick remoulade sauce was a poor match and added nothing to the dish.  \\n\\nSome other little tweaks here would be appreciated. For example the oysters were served with home made crackers, a nice touch but they were too sweet and didn't allow the oyster flavor to shine. Traditional saltines are a better match as the bland taste is the perfect foundation for the briney sea creatures. I also didn't care for the cocktail sauce, it was quite sour. The addition of the freshly grated horseradish helped a tiny bit, but raw horseradish is quite a powerful thing. \\n\\nWe tried the blackberry crumble for dessert. It was a nice dish but the thyme ice cream on top ruined it. The spice added a weird contrast to the sweet berries. Again, a simple vanilla bean scoop of ice cream would have been just fine here. \\n\\nThe atmosphere and vibe of The Optimist is a traditional New England fish house. In the coming days I hope the powers that be here work out the recipes to better match that tradition.

After speaking with Michelle, the manager, several times and was given Corn Bread as a substitute until our food was ready we still did not receive our meals. Finally after 4 hours of back and forth we left the restaurant. The service here is terrible!!  What we that was rumored to be a grown and sexy atmosphere ended being nothing but a unfulfilled hood restaurant with terrible to no service.

So, it was set up to me that it would be good barbecue with a great craft beer list. I see they also have bocce courts, which is cool, although obviously no one is playing it when it's 40 degrees outside. They've done a great job at renovating the place, I'll be honest. You can barely tell what it used to be. There's lots of seating, and our wait was minimal.\\n\\nNow, to the food and beer. The \\"craft beer\\" list? Mostly commercial stuff, not too crafty, unless Sam Adams is craft beer to you. Server didn't know what the seasonal beers were, and told me wrong on another one. I'd say I'd give this place a C on craft beer selection. Also, I bought a Terrapin Liquid Bliss, which they brought out in a plastic cup. A plastic cup, like the kind you get at a party. Except I paid $8 for this beer, and I'm not at a party. I was told it was so people could take the beer outside. I don't want to go outside, I want to enjoy a good craft beer inside. This is lame.\\n\\nWe ordered the pitmaster sampler, which included most all of the meats. I'll review each of the meats. The wings? Weird flavor, like charcoal lighter fluid or gas. Also, the server couldn't describe the sauce options, and we couldn't sample them before ordering them. I asked for someone who could describe them, and he sent over the owner's wife. I told him I can't expect to know the flavors, they're not described in the menu, and I've never been there.\\n\\nPulled pork was heated up and lukewarm. Neither of us ate more than a taste. Ribs were pretty good, although not done, and hard to pull off the bone. Brisket was most definitely not sliced as described, but chopped and more like shredded. Flavor was ok, but I was really looking forward to sliced brisket. Sides were ok, fries and corn, although the corn had the same charcoal fluid or gas taste my wife couldn't stand. The standard sauce is actually tasty, and I didn't try the other flavors.\\n\\nOverall, I wish for more for this place, because I want it to succeed. I love barbecue. I love craft beer. And I'd love to spend more time here. But it's just not ready. I'll try again in a month, but they need to work on a lot of things including service. Until then, I'll continue to hit Atlanta's best barbecue, which happens to be not far from here, Heirloom BBQ."},{"name":"Reale's Italian Cafe","address":"13450 N Hwy 183, Ste 230","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I just love spending time with family.

I did not complain or make a commotion and gave my tip and left. I won't ever be back though. I came during a busy Saturday night and was seated next to some Chinese buffet/ Chuck E. Cheese- like buffet booth. Not only were they sticky and not wiped, but they were also old and needed to be replaced. I went and dined at St. Cecilia last week ( same owner) and the experience there were excellent. \\nService: 20-30 servers were walking around so it was not like they had 100 customers per 1 server. It took them 30 minutes before noticing and pouring us lukewarm water ( who knows a fast fill 'em up near the faucet)? The worst service I have ever received at a ($$$) restaurant this year and I have dined at many places. I still tip them at the customary 18% and left. \\n\\nOysters: I ordered a variety of oysters from New Brunswick, Connecticut, and Washington State. I prefer the NB more. It was clean and did not have an after taste. \\nFried Calamari: It was mehhhh. Something I expect from an Olive Garden/movie theater-like Studio Movie Grill/Applebee's food if you know what I mean. Why? It was not freshly breaded and it was definitely pre-made and cooked in a microwave. Again does not justified a ($$$). \\n\\nDrinks: I ordered champagne for myself and a Bronx cocktail (forgot the full name cause I don't care by this point) for my girl. She drank both of them. The drinks are strong, so I do like that! Moreover, she came out happy, which was all that i cared last night. This was the only reason I gave it one extra star. Had it been me, this place honestly only deserves 1. \\nRecommendation: if you want to continue supporting this restaurant, I highly recommend St. Cecilia. The service and food both make this place look like a fast-casual restaurant. The customers next to me wore baggy sweat pants with the straps which are not something you would see at a restaurant. In NYC, you will not even be served and ask to leave. The server placed them next to us. I guess they think we were second class citizen, seated next to second class customer w./ amenities such as a dead kitchen fly burning next to our oyster, drinks, and calamari. Also, the female host (3 of them in the front) when I called in for a reservation was rude and hung upon us. We still made the drive from Alpharetta to here. That's why we didn't get a reservation.

I was at that point in the day where I was so tired and indecisive, but Samantha was very patient with me and answered all my questions. I ordered some Savage Blonde raw oysters, a cup of clam chowder, and a fish sandwich. The oysters were fantastic, ill order more the next time I'm there. The clam chowder was full of clams and bacon, I dipped some of the house bread in my chowder. The fish sandwich was good, but the chowder and oysters were the stars of the night.

May not be important to others but really is to me comfort wise if I'm going to take my time and enjoy my meal to its fullest.\\n\\nService was friendly but did not appear to be experienced in this level of dining. Not that it was fine dining but it's not Sonic either. The clothes, the general slightly disheveled appearance and mannerisms: she was very fidgety and swayed back and forth every time she was at the table speaking to us and taking our order. After one extended visit at our table of several minutes, I thought if I don't quit looking at her I'm going to have motion sickness. \\n\\nThe food was meh. I would not order any of the items again. The arancini was soooo dry! We were told it was made with 4 meats for lots of flavor but it had NO flavor at all. And no cheese. And no perceptible seasoning. It was just an extremely bland and dry fried ball of risotto. Had I tasted this prior to ordering my entr√©e, I never would have ordered the risotto of the day which was spinach and cream risotto and I added scallops. What cream? Again so very dry. It was more rice like then risotto like. And again zero flavor. The scallops were barely seared on one side and it looked  like they were not even flipped to the other side while cooking. They were okay but bland as well. Where's the seasoning??? I ate the scallops and left 90% of the risotto on my plate.\\n\\nMy dining partner had the Bolognese. She said it was OK. I tasted it and thought the same thing. I make much better Bolognese at home and expect more from an Italian restaurant. I'm sure it wasn't but it almost tasted like prepackaged.\\n\\nThey also do not offer any bread before or with your meal. You may order some off the appetizer menu if you like. We did not.\\n\\nThe highlight of the meal was the wine. It was a Super Tuscan that was pretty good. The price by the bottle was about what is expected price wise at three times the retail price. It was warmer than room temperature, possibly due to the fact it was in the upper 90s outside when we were there, so the manager brought over a cooling stick. He was very friendly and helpful.

We had good memory of their dal (which, frankly, tasted a little Indo-Chinese, which we liked) that we once got for delivery, so we thought of trying it again.\\n\\nService was slow. As mentioned in other reviews, it seemed that there was only one person taking care of orders for dinner service (including us, there were only 3 parties present for the whole duration of our dinner). It took a good while for them to give us water and the menu, but eventually they did.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n- One order of samosas (2 pieces): served with the tamarind and mint chutneys. The chutneys were OK, standard, store-bought. The samosas were doughy and bland, and the skin was very thick. Nowhere near the quality of the samosas from Indian Sweets n' Spice down the road. Would not recommend.\\n- Gobi Manchurian: tasted OK but they were not crispy - felt like they were reheated, soggy. Would not recommend.\\n- Malai Kofta: not a lot of koftas (4 pieces I think?); sauce was OK, good consistency, but overly tomato-y and no trace of cashew taste as there should be. Looking at the menu, it felt like they had essentially one or two base sauces and every kind of meat could be cooked in them with small variations - that is, the sauces were not cooked individually. Overall the dish was OK.\\n- Some kind of assorted platter of tandoori meats: we ordered it because a neighboring table ordered some kind of tandoori dish and they served it sizzling on a hot cast iron skillet on a bed of onions and with the sauce (which tasted like the sauce in the malai kofta). It definitely smelled good; most pieces were good, chicken was fairly juicy, there was a tiny piece of fish, two shrimps, and a few chunks of very bland, dry, and overcooked lamb as the \\"kabob\\" part of the tandoori platter that had to be eaten with the sauce, which, again, tasted good but was extremely generic. The dish was OK.\\n- Garlic naan: thin, very crispy, lots of minced garlic and glistening with butter, it was the highlight of the meal. Still felt like it was a dressed-up version of a store-bought naan, though.\\n\\nOverall impressions:\\nPoor, slow service, tired tasting food that felt like they were reheated dishes based on the same sauce with small variations. The price came out to around $50, which was simply too expensive for the amount and quality of the food. It was a far cry from our previous experience with the delivered dal (which was, if memory serves, reasonably priced and rather tasty).

We were a party of four. My first time there. We had to wait for a bit, but this is a \\"trendy\\" joint so the wait wasn't unexpected nor too long.\\n\\nWhen we were seated, our server was pretty good and made sure we were taken care of for drinks. \\n\\nThe food was kind of sub-par for the price level. The prices are only a little too high here, but servings are on the small side and some things weren't prepared all that well. Both my wife and I had bacon with our orders. You get two (?) slices of bacon and it is really undercooked. I like juicy bacon and usually don't care for it overdone and hard, but applying a little heat and actually cooking it (instead of just blanching it) would be preferable. Additionally, two slices is just a bit miserly. My wife ordered two fried eggs with her meal and asked for \\"medium\\" doneness. On my planet that usually means runny yolks and solid whites. Even the cheapest hash slinging house can always get fried eggs done right, so when my wife's eggs arrived we were surprised to see how completely overdone they were. (Hockey pucks). She also got toast with her order and ended up with one piece of uncooked bread with a couple of grill marks across it. Really? One piece of toast? Kind of cheap. \\n\\nI ordered their pancakes. You get two of them and for $1.25 more you can get real maple syrup. I have to admit their cakes were pretty decent and the real stuff syrup was an added plus. A little too expensive though.\\n\\nWe won't likely be coming back. Servers were nice, the place is clean, and the wait wasn't really all that bad. If they could only improve quality and quantity of their food, I think this place would rate much higher. From where I was sitting, I did get to see one of their hamburgers come up to be served. It looked pretty good. As it is, there are too many other good places to eat in Portland to bother with food of this quality. Altogether my wife and I spent $35 for tea, coffee, and breakfast.

It's heaven and comfort food in a bowl.\\n\\nWhile some might be disappointed in their menu size compared to other Viet restaurants in their area, I personally like that their menu is to the point and has a list of staple items that I gravitate towards. By no means is their menu small, but you might not find one of the more obscure combinations that you would find in other joints here. My friends swear by the Bun Bo Hue, citing it to be some of the best in town. Honestly I prefer a little more color and chili oil in my Bun Bo Hue, but that's probably just me and honestly their Bun Bo Hue was very good. Their pho though is definitely the star of this place. I'm not quite sure how to describe what makes it so good, but it's got a layer of complexity that is often missing from other pho shops. \\n\\nSeating is on the smaller size - it definitely feels more of a mom and pop stop with the atmosphere and open-ish kitchen which you can peep right in.

Cocktails and coffee..  the bloody mary and a coffee/rum drink were both lackluster.  Just kind of blah.  Mimosas were okay, but again nothing special and for the price would expect more especially at a brunch.  Espresso tasted like crap.  Coffee was good, but sat a big part of the meal with empty cups.

We had made dinner reservations for January 5, 2017 at 6pm to celebrate our anniversary. The hostesses were friendly and promptly embarked us to our journey. Our tour guide (server), Fletcher, couldn't have made our night any more special. Starting off with some complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate, we went through the itinerary of where we would be exploring: \\n\\nWe first visited Yorkshire and the pudding there was amazing. Baked to be just crispy enough on the outside and gooey on the inside; we knew we were in for a special treat. \\n\\nNext we went ocean side in Spain, and had some Shrimp a la Pancha and Spanish Octopus. The Shrimp a la Pancha here was full of savory umami and cooked to just fall off its shell. The Spanish Octopus was so tender and soft, you wouldn't believe it was octopus you were eating.\\n\\nNext we decided to go visit The King and how majestic he was. Sitting on his high throne, decorated with thyme and other garnishes. The marrow provided a refreshing break from all the perfectly prepared meat. Fletcher was kind enough to order us the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, which he also paid for, it being one of his favorite side dishes to go with the King. Our taste buds were thankful that he did. \\n\\nSaving no room for dessert, we ended our journey here and thanked Fletcher and the staff at King + Duke for an amazing anniversary dinner.

No one said a word to us and they were dressed so casually I first thought that they were diners waiting on their food. (Turns out they were all waiters and waitresses, God only knows if they had had a meeting or something before we got there but several were on their phones) \\n\\nSo, we let ourselves into the restaurant because no one said anything to us. We walked all the way to the back (or front, I guess if you're coming in off the street). It was SO DARK that we decided we would rather eat outside than guess at what we were eating. It was also very cold and very loud. Finally, we asked a bartender where we were supposed to go to get seated and he told us to go back outside. So we hopped up on a table back out on the patio and about 10 minutes pass before a woman came out and asked if we had been helped. We said \\"no\\" and she said she would get us seated in a minute and get us water while we waited. She then turned to a larger party, there for a birthday, and said that they needed to go up front and meet the woman at the desk to get seated. \\n\\nThankfully, the \\"woman at the desk\\" also turned this group away because I would've been pretty miffed about it if they had been seated. Finally we DO see people getting seated (and never got our waters) and so we go BACK upfront to get seated but now we have to stand in a rather sizable line. When we did finally get seated at a table, the music was so loud that we hardly talked to each other. It was 11:25 by the time someone came by to take our orders (we arrived at 10:50. All the food looked to be overpriced but I was certain it was going to be good. I ordered the chicken biscuit meal. I was excited for it, and when it came out it looked delicious! \\n\\nWhen I took a bite, the biscuit was good, the chicken was good, the eggs were on the slimy side (but hell, some people like that) and the potatoes were good. Unfortunately, any other taste in the meal was completely covered up by the amount of salt in their pork gravy. All I could taste was salt. I scraped as much of the gravy off as I could. My husband liked it but still agreed that there was too much salt. I was not pleased. The only reason I could think for over salting food is to prevent it from tasting off if it was getting a little old and I did come home to nearly immediate gastric distress. \\n\\nI never take the time to write reviews so maybe I'm just in a bad mood today, idk. However, leaving this place my thought was, if you want to go to a nice brunch on a day off then you are better off going to one of the other hundred places in Atlanta for brunch and save this one for occasions when you're stuck with people you don't like or want to talk to and are paying for you!"},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Came here for brunch and was not disappointed!

Everyone we encountered, especially our waitress Lauren, were friendly, courteous, and certainly patient given the extremely busy Saturday evening. Unfortunately, there isn't much I can speak highly of beyond that. \\n\\nWe were very excited to visit Mary Mac's. This was my girlfriend's first time visiting Atlanta and my first time going to the Tea Room. Prior to our visit, we asked our friends for recommendations and many immediately suggested Mary Mac's. We don't consider ourselves foodies; but we definitely enjoy Southern comfort food. \\n\\nWhen we were seated, Lauren brought up a bread basket containing cornbread, yeast rolls, and cinnamon rolls. By far the best of the bunch are the cinnamon rolls. The cornbread was forgettable.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Deviled Eggs and Hush Puppies. By far, this was the best part of our meal. If there's anything we would recommend from the list, it would be these two items. Because they were delicious, we looked forward to our entrees.\\n\\nHere's where everything, honestly, went downhill. And again, maybe it's because we were expecting a lot. \\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken with Whipped Potatoes and Broccoli Souffl√©. The portions for everything were generous. The Whipped Potatoes were just that; whipped. They were bland and simply had no flavor. My girlfriend didn't touch the Broccoli Souffl√© at all after the first bite, the dish was very watery and had a distinct unfavorable taste. In fact, we noticed the table next to us returned a side that looked like her Broccoli Souffl√©. The Chicken Fried Chicken's only saving grace was its gravy. However, it wasn't that great and only served as a sauce to the breaded chicken patty which had no flavor whatsoever. \\n\\nI ordered the Four-piece Fried Chicken along with Mac and Cheese plus Collard Greens. The classic and popular Southern comfort food entree. Immediately I noticed something wrong when I saw the color of the fried chicken. It was light brown and didn't appear seasoned enough. As I suspected, the fried chicken really had no flavor whatsoever. Yes it was cooked thoroughly and moist, but bland enough that I didn't care for it at all and didn't finish the meal. The Mac and Cheese seemed undercooked. It contained a layer of dried, melted cheese on top with the macaroni mixed with half baked cheese. The Collard Greens were cooked well, but just bland like everything else.\\n\\nFinally, we got a slice of Peach Cobbler and Pecan Pie. The Pecan Pie was good, but had no pie crust under it. But in general, the pecans were warm and crunchy and better than the entree I had. The Peach Cobbler wasn't as impressive. The crust was soggy with no crunch. On the bright side, the Cobbler slice contained enough peaches that were done just right. Nonetheless, it's definitely not the best Cobbler we've had. \\n\\nIn general, between the wait time (1 hour), finding parking, and recommendations from others, perhaps our expectations were too high. But as I mentioned before, we're not foodies and we appreciate Southern food. Sadly, this was a disappointment for me. And considering the time to find parking and wait for a table, we highly doubt we'll return or recommend to any of our friends."},{"name":"Pastelaria S√£o Paulo","address":"2512 Rio Grande St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is so good!

Maybe they wanted to spread out the customers so the wait staff in that room could get some business. Okay, so the ice tea to me was pretty ordinary. Portions were very good and I enjoyed my chicken and dumplings and sides. Our peach cobbler dessert was the best cobbler I've ever had. Even thinking about it now I recall how good it was.

Which is great for the first few bites, it's heaven -- but not so much towards the end of the meal. \\n\\nThe coffee was great. \\n\\nThe jams and spreads were great. They give you some lemon curd and lingoberry jam, which is tart and rich. \\n\\nThe bread is heavy and seeded, oven toasted and something I'd buy from the store. \\n\\nThe danish pancakes were perfectly round, with a strong scent of cardamom. \\n\\nThe crispy potato dish was fantastic. \\n\\nAll the flavors pop.

Then minutes later a Spanish speaking couple were sat on the next booth next to us.  The waiter was short and to the point.  The chip lady brought us 1 basket of chips, salsa and beans.  Which they are delicious!  The booth next to us got the same.  Later we ran out of chips, salsa and beans and so did the booth next to us.  Our waiter nor did the chip lady offer us any chips at all and they both saw that we we out, they just looked and keep walking.  But with the Spanish speaking couple next to us, received 2 more baskets of chips, salsa and beans without even asking, just brought it to them automatically.  And I also want to add that we had the same waiter.  I mentioned this to my husband and asked if it was maybe because we ordered water to drink but as I walked out I took a peek at their table and they also all had water.  \\n\\nAnd there is also one more thing or incident that has happened several times.

The only redeeming factor here was the delicious crust.. which is basically just partially deep fried deep dish pizza similar to Pizza Hut deep dish..."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Mary Mac's is THE place to put some south in your mouth! \\n\\nThe restaurant/food hall (there's like 5+ dining rooms in here) is an Atlanta food institution since 1945.

I've seen this restaurant on Food network and the travel channel, and I can easily see why. \\n\\n     \\"Great Simple Soul Food + Southern Hospitality + Value for the food = Authentic Southern Experience\\"\\n\\nI sat at the bar along with some other first timers/tourists but looking around, there was plenty of locals.

Lightly golden brown and served at the perfect temperature so you can just jump right into southern perfection. You always hear crispy and juicy, but THIS IS crispy, juicy, with the meat just melting in my mouth. I liked how it wasn't overly seasoned or overly fried, just simple and tasty. The white meat was even juicy! Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. \\n\\nI went with the FRIED GREEN TOMATOES (6.5/10) and CHEESY GRITS side (8/10). The parmesan horseradish had a little bit too much zing for my liking but I liked how the breading wasn't overly seasoned. The cheesy grits were delicious as advertised. \\n\\nI wasn't a big fan of the COMPLIMENTARY CINNAMON ROLLS and bread rolls, but appreciated the hospitality.   \\n\\nFinished the meal off with their signature GEORGIA PEACH COBBLER. $4.5 (8/10). Warm with a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg and the \\"crust\\" falls in between a biscuit and a pie crust. Legit!\\n\\nFried chicken was really good.

Alchemy is right across the street from Nationwide Children's Hospital, so easy to pop over for lunch; they also have a large parking lot, which is not common. The restaurant itself is a huge space with tons of seating, both indoors and outdoors. The setup is a little confusing, since they share their space with The Fitness Loft, but once you find the counter, it's smooth sailing.\\n\\nMy sister and I love a good smoothie bowl, so we were eager to try Alchemy's take. I went for the blueberry almond butter bowl (best seller per the cashier) - with almond butter mixed in with the acai and topped with banana, granola, and coconut, it had such a refreshing flavor that really filled me up. Only wish it had some almond butter on top too! My sister got the nutty dragon, which she raved about - the puffed quinoa was a unique topper, but paired with the cacao nibs, brought together the bowl. We both were impressed with the bowls - they filled us up and were so beautiful and fresh! A great start to the day. I ordered a drip coffee to pair, which was tasty, but did have some grounds in the bottom, so not super great. My sister got the cold brew, which was reasonably priced and super delish. \\n\\nOverall, Alchemy is a great spot for a quick, healthy, fresh lunch or breakfast.

Blue Dahlia has a small inside venue that definitely has an artistic coffee shop feel to it, with art around the walls and a cozy atmosphere.  If you are visiting with a large party, I would definitely recommend making a reservation, as there are only a few large tables that I saw.  They have indoor and outdoor seating, which is great in Austin, and although I did not go out back, one of the staff told me they have fans going full blast to beat the heat.  The table we sat at was comfortable and large enough for an even larger party than ourselves.\\n\\nThe service we received was top notch.  Our waitress was attentive but not overbearing.  She made great recommendations when asked about the soups, cheeses, and specials.  Our party did not have to wait overly long for drinks, and the food even came out quicker than I expected. \\n\\nThe food was also on point, although the menu was a bit hard for me to understand at first.  I guess that's to be expected since I was unfamiliar with most of the dishes.  Also, I have no doubt the waitress would have been helpful had I asked.  For a drink, I ordered a Mocha chino, which was very large and came with it's own cup of chocolate, which I liked.  Other members of my party enjoyed the $2 mimosas, which they said were tasty and strong enough.  My entree, the Coq au Vin Blanc, was a delicious bowl that was very dense with food, and gave me enough for leftovers even after eating for quite a bit.  My complaint about my entree is that it was extremely hot.  Even after dipping the bread on my plate and stirring for a while, the bowl was not edible until I let it cool down for a while.  This was a small nuisance, but not the end of the world.  \\n\\nMy other complaint was the method of paying the check.  I understand that doing separate checks can be harder on the staff, but it's annoying to have to go through a check and add up your own total, when it seems that many other places can do separate checks with no problems.  \\n\\nFor the quality of food that we received, I feel that the restaurant was very inexpensive.  I enjoyed my entree and drink immensely and paid much less than I would for a comparably good meal elsewhere.  It was a great night made better by the quality of the venue.

Food wise, the portions are rather small for the price, but there is a large variety of traditional and fusion dishes which in my opinion is nice. The food itself though is average, nothing stood out or was memorable. The tamarind wings were a little on the over-salty side, beef carpaccio was average (their sauce was way too sweet and not enough flavor balance), the cassava fries tasted like the ones from Costco, but the bo bia was the highlight of the meal as it reminded me of eating them in Vietnam from street vendors. \\n\\nThe service was a miss, the server who was working was probably an international student who was having some communication issues, but in the end we got our food.

Here's what we don't like: \\n\\n- The food is noticeably worse - much blander, sometimes cold, and often made with mistakes (ingredients unwantedly missing or added). At first, my husband and I hoped the cooks might still be finding their footing, but it's now been more than half a year since this location opened and the food has yet to improve. \\n\\n- The service is slower (we've waited 30+ minutes to order every time) and ruder. During our last visit, I ordered a chocolate peanut butter frappe, and our waiter told me they couldn't add peanut butter. I said, \\"Really? The kitchen here has done it for me before. Could you please ask?\\" He walked away without answering and then brought me a plain frappe. \\n\\n- This may seem silly, but the vibe isn't as fun and cool.

I can't remember exactly what I put on mine, but I know there were peppers on there and some pepper aioli.  TBH the burger was not very good, especially for the price.  The most disappointing thing was that I ordered the burger medium-rare and it came out well done, and really didn't have much flavor at all.  The pretzel bun was pretty much the only thing holding it together.\\n\\nI also tried an order of their truffle fries, but again wasn't impressed here.

It's McMenamins Kennedy School, a nearly 100 year old elementary school building that has been converted into a one of a kind destination for dining, drinking, lodging, music, movies, meetings...\\n\\nEverything about this facility is amazing.  The attention to detail in the artwork is incredible-- from huge, bizarre sculptures to tiny painted faces in unlikely places.  There are elementary-themed paintings and historical photographs lining the hallways.  There is a huge gas torch in one of the outdoor seating areas and ornate metal screens over wood-burning fire pits in others.  The Boiler Room makes extensive use of old plumbing fittings as railings and retains some of the original electrical system controls on the walls.  The Detention Bar is a cigar lounge.  The Courtyard and Cypress bars feature lots of outdoor seating.  The Theater Bar will serve you dinner and drinks while watch a ($3!) movie.  \\n\\nWith six bars to choose from on the premises, I think the best thing to do is grab a beer at the first one you come to and then proceed to wander the halls checking the whole place out while you drink!  Then you can find a comfortable place to sit down and enjoy a meal or just order some more drinks...\\n\\nA word of caution about dining, however: the menu is NOT the same at all of the bars within the Kennedy School.  When I was with a group that recently visited and decided to sit in the Boiler Room we were surprised to find a brief menu with a few apps, sandwiches, and pizza-- no fish & chips, burgers, or other dishes that I was expecting to be on the menu.  Turns out that these dishes are available within the Kennedy School, just not at that particular bar.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful though, so I'd recommend approaching a staff member if you have any questions or problems finding exactly what you want while you're here.  Also, don't forget you can always order a beer at one place and then if you decide to go elsewhere you can just pick it up and take it with you!\\n\\nOn the negative side, dining here can be rather slow and expensive.

As other reviewers have said, the chicken was a little overcooked and was not tender at all. They also weren't all that great. The waffles were crunchy and actually pretty good. But they put the tiniest amount of syrup on them. I couldn't taste the syrup at all. I ended up having to go back to ask for more syrup. And a knife. They only gave me a spork.

In lower class cultures, the focus is on getting enough to eat.  Hence, you'll hear a lot of \\"did you get enough to eat?\\" and any communal gathering will be punctuated by an overabundance of food.  As you move up into the middle class, they know there will be enough to eat, and instead the focus shifts to, \\"did it taste good?\\"  As you move into the upper classes, they know the food will taste good, so they wonder \\"did the food look pretty?\\" \\n\\nLet's just say that Lenoir knocks it out of the park on all accounts.  \\n\\nI didn't really know what to expect before I went, I didn't read the menu and I simply went by the Yelp reviews that said, in essence, \\"excellent.\\"  It was also the only place I could find last minute reservations a day before.  \\n\\nI have no idea why that was the case, because this restaurant just became one of my favorites.   The menu is small, but it feels bigger than it is.  It's prixe fixe, so you're going to be paying $38 a person basically, no matter what you do.  But don't worry, it's going to feel like a bargain by the time you're through.  The only options are to add some bread for $5, which I highly recommend, or another serving for $10, which I don't -- because you're going to be full anyway.  You can also get some wine if that's your thing. \\n\\nYour three courses are going to be large and filling.

The salmon chips were okay (Serpas is much better) but they forgot the hush puppies which came out after the entrees. I ordered the brisket which our server said was their best dish. It was a huge hunk of meat on a plate with a sad squash assortment next to it. I felt like Fred Flinstone. The brisket was dry so I had to order extra sauce. The duck was also dry. The hush puppies were overcooked and the crabcake was about the size of a silver dollar. Seriously. As we were leaving the valet was crazy backed up and I noticed we all smelled like we had just left a BBQ. That smoky brisket smell was all over us. Ick. The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant which is cool but they should really think about getting better ventilation. Overall, I think you're paying more for ambiance because the food and drinks just weren't anything special, especially at that price point. If I'm going to drop $100+ on dinner I better actually enjoy more than just dim lighting and live music. I could dim the lights and bust out the Spotify playlist at home for free."},{"name":"Element Bistro","address":"6315 Lookout Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"My ladies group of 14 had our monthly dinner night out at Element.

We had to ask for a desert menu and probably had it on the table for at least 20-30 minutes without them coming back.  Finally called them over, ordered desert and coffee.  The coffee was luke warm which seems strange on a Saturday night when they have plenty of business.

That has been changing recently, as the neighborhood has been changing. A few restaurants have been around forever, though none of them would be anything you would go out of your way for (the exception being Ria's Bluebird). Several have opened and closed rapidly. Mediterranea is the grooviest restaurant the neighborhood has had in the last decade. Generally, Middle Eastern-inspired (I know that doesn't sound good), the menu is gluten-free (that also doesn't sound great unless one is gluten-free) with a lot of vegetarian options and some unusual dishes. I have eaten there twice and prefer the dinner menu, where we have ordered the quartet of spreads, very yummy, the baked feta in red sauce, swell, and the house salad of Boston lettuce, watermelon radish, sweet onions and pistachios, which was spectacular. This place should be of particular interest to vegans. They also have excellent cocktails such as the Blueberry Bramble with Four Roses whiskey, ginger liqueur, blueberries and lemon. The brunch was fine and much healthier than any brunch you would find elsewhere (I don't think they use much oil), though not as inspired as the dinner menu.

I'd say we still waited 45 minutes to an hour from when I put myself on the waitlist to get in.\\n\\nThis place is a little confusing to find, it's not a storefront on the street. It's in an arcade building. Enter and it's the ramen shop on the left ( the one that is busy!). The place is tiny so they take your order when you are about to get seated so they bring you your food soon after you sit down. Unfortunately, when it was our turn to order, they said we had two options: light tomato ramen or creamy tomato ramen, both with chicken. I didn't realize they only served certain things on certain nights or could run out of things. It was only 7:30 PM so it wasn't really that late. It was unclear what happened but I wasn't happy that they didn't tell us this when we checked in initially. I was hoping to get a pork-based ramen in a true ramen broth. If I wanted noodles in a tomatoe-based sauce, I would go to the North End.\\n\\nThe ramen was fine, nothing special, and it wasn't really what we came there for. I don't feel like this is a fair judgment of the place but they really didn't provide me that option. Like most tiny ramen places, you are in and out quickly which would be fine with me if I had really enjoyed the food.\\n\\nI'd much rather go to Santouka at this point but maybe I should go back to try some of the stuff on their main menu."},{"name":"La Hacienda Mexican Restaurant","address":"2260 S Volusia Ave","city":"Orange City","stars":"3.5","text":"This Is a great restaurant has the best Mexican food i have ever tasted and my family has been going here before I was born and evertime we go everyone enjoys the food they serve they have great service and the food is great"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Blueberry, Portland cream, and captain crunch, all for $5.35.

They've renovated the old Draft Pick location that was here and transformed the typical dive-y sports bar locale into a real clean and modern setup. The staff and service is attentive as hell; seems like a lot of familiar faces from the wait staff at 888 which also operates at impeccable efficiency and speed.\\n\\nThe current menu is a rotational experiment, a good way to solicit feedback from early guests. Although there is no issues with being limited, there is a sort of disappointment in looking at a menu that looks almost identical to the items offered at 888, albeit with a 30 - 50% markup.\\n\\nAnd this is ultimately where 1618 fails to meet the mark: not because the food is not good (888 is a personal 5-star and weekly favorite), but because it is nearly identical to everything at 888. Outside of having nicer plates and silverware and a nice venue, the menu items look and feel the same as its more affordable sister restaurant just 7 minutes away. Based on my understanding of what the owners are going for in terms of delivering a slightly tiered up experience, this is where the food lacks real differentiation or creativity. \\n\\nGiven our endless loyalty to 888 (delicious, affordable, efficient), we're hopeful that 1618 will soon find its own niche of a slightly more up-scaled (yet equally delicious, relatively affordable, and efficient) pan-asian restaurant. We'll certainly be back for a round 2 in a few months to see if that's the case."},{"name":"Seize the Bagel - Hazel Dell","address":"9904 NE Hwy 99","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a fantastic spot, I come here on a weekly basis to buy breakfast for my customers.

I do buy the $10 bucket of day-old doughnuts sometimes. The leftovers go to charity for the most part, but you can get your hands on a bucket for super cheap and share them out. They come in a big frosting bucket and must have 20 doughnuts in it. Since I only live 6 hours away and my mom lives in the middle of that drive, there is a doughnut for all!  \\n\\nAll-in-all the cultural Portland vibe and the popularity is indeed worth the visit. If you're going downtown just for this, I suggest you visit their other location because it's not in the hustle and bustle of drunkenness, but rather somewhere with ample parking and seating.

We arrived about 10:45 yesterday (Friday) eager to try the BBQ that we had repeatedly heard compared to Franklin.  The line wasn't too long and moved quickly and before we knew it it was our turn to order.  That is when things started to go bad.  The man taking our order and slapping our food on a tray seemed to have put on his b@#chy britches that morning.  He started out complaining that he had to go out to the smoker to get our prime rib, and his snippiness continued throughout our interaction with him.  That's okay.  I'll put up with a b@#ch who can cook, but minus one star for the bad behavior from someone in a customer service job. \\n\\nBut then we got to the food.  The pork ribs were awful!  Horribly tough and dry.  The flavor was good, but the ribs were so tough they were more like jerky than ribs.  Minus one star.\\n\\nThe brisket was much better.  It was moist, had a nice smoke ring, had good flavor.  The only problem was the quality of the meat.  It was super fatty.  I like moist brisket, but where there is just as much fat as there is meat, and the fat is still intact and hasn't melted, that is just nasty.  I won't deduct a star for this, because it was the only really edible thing on the plate.  But I will slap anyone who compares this crap to Franklin's fabulous brisket.  \\n\\nNext was the prime rib.  Again, poor quality of the meat.  Again just as much fat as meat and the fat was still very much intact.  And the meat was far from tender.  In fact it was so tough that we couldn't come close to cutting it with the plastic knives provided.  Minus a star.\\n\\nLast we had the sausage.  It was good, not great.  One of the better things on a tray now filled with inedible (literally could not chew them) ribs, and big strips of fat from the brisket and prime rib.  Couldn't save the day though.\\n\\nThe sides were good.  If you are a vegetarian, I could see coming here and could even see how J Mueller could get favorable reviews when compared to Franklin.  Other than that, there is no saving grace about this place.\\n---------\\nI'm updating my review to deduct a star because I received a response from the owner that was just as weird and rude as his behavior the day of my visit to his trailer.  Lots of proclamations about how funny he is and how his being a jerk is just shtick.  Like he is the BBQ nazi.  But the thing about the soup nazi is his food rocked and the crap this guy served me SUCKED!  He provided no explanation of why all of his meats were mainly undisoved fat except for the ribs where like bone in jerky.  I didn't need an explanation of why he is an A hole, that is a fact few people dispute.

When I told her I wanted a refund because I would not be ordering from them again, her response is, \\"Why not?\\" I told her because they didn't deliver all the food that I ordered, and then she says, \\"it was only the drink.\\" Of course, I shouldn't have to explain to her that I ordered the drink because I needed it, that I didn't have anything else to drink, because it was a food item that I ordered that they didn't bring me.

As you walk in it takes you to the front where you are greeted by a host. I really like all the glass chalk writing on the outside windows and the fact they have a small area for kiddos to play. Nice looking store, very welcoming \\n\\nMenu - as the name sports the place is a cajun and pizza place. The name makes it kind of sound more like a pizza place that has a cajun take on pizza. But it actually has a full cajun menu and a pizza menu. The pizzas aren't really very cajun-y except for the fact you can add shrimp and crawfish to them. The main allure of there pizza is they use a thin homemade crust. The pizzas they offered looked good and they also have a build your own pizza section.  The cajun menu hits all the main staples of poboys, red beans & rice, gumbo and etouffee. Aside from that they do have some other items but those are the main dishes. Menu looks pretty good and had some decent options. Most of the cajun dishes come in 3 different sizes of normal, large and extra large. So overall it isn't a very big menu but a good size of selections\\n\\nService - one of the best servers I have ever had. The cute young lady was extremely friendly and very genuine. The way she talked was more like we friends or family and not just an order taker. She talked and acted like a normal human being. She asked if I had ever been there and I responded no. She then gave me some great recommendations and even asked if I wanted samples of the Cajun Holy Trinity. Heck yea I want to try out the triforce of cajun food, so she went and brought me a sample of etouffee, red beans & rice and gumbo. On top of that, she was very attentive and I basically did have to ask for anything because she had already brought it or refilled my drink. For a young girl she was on top of her s#$%. Granted I was like the only one in there, but her genuine personality and extremely friendly demeanor was on point. The only \\"problem\\" was she broke one of the cardinal rules of serving. She dropped the check before asking if I needed anything else. Dropping the check before a guest is checked on or asks for it, is basically telling a guest that I'm done with you and goodbye. But she looks really young so she could be fairly new to to game. But no points deducted because she was such an awesome and attentive server. Mad bonus points for service. \\n\\nFood - so I got to sample the trifecta of cajun cuisine.  Which was awesome to be able to sample before choosing. The crawfish etouffee was delicious, it was nice and creamy and had some great seasoning and crawfish flavor. The red beans and rice were also really good. The beans were seasoned well and packed a nice flavor of spices. The gumbo was very flavorful and also sported some great spices and seasonings. The sausage was moist and flavorful and had a great taste. It definitely didnt taste like generic sausage some places use. Having tried all the main players I had a hard time choosing so I went with my servers recommendation of crawfish pirogue. Which is a bread loaf hollowed out, filled with etouffee and then baked with cheese.  I wasnt disappointed in my choice. The bread used was really good, it was crispy and flaky and had  great taste. The bread complimented the etouffee very well. The one thing that was off was that their was too much cheese on top. On some bites the cheese overpowered the dish. So I just scraped off the cheese and everything was great again. Like I said before, the etouffee was really good. It wasnt overly robust but had just the right amount of crawfish and spices so that it isn't super fishy tasting or the spices kicking your tastebuds in the nuts. I really enjoyed all the items that I had. \\n\\nOverall - so I give my coveted 5 star because of the service. The food was great, yeah but the service was stellar. I only give a 5th star for something above and beyond. And it was well earned today. The food was some of the better cajun food I have had. Not the best i have had but definitely a contender in spots of good cajun food.  My food was really good and the samples had some great flavor. Service on point and a decent menu. It is one of the better cajun food restaurants here in north Austin.

(Is Hapeville still a sleepy town now that the Porsche headquarters is there?)  The place is steeped in Chick-Fil-A history and on several occasions I've seen groups taking tours of the kitchen.\\n\\nOn one side of the Dwarf House is a typical Chick-Fil-A fast food counter where you can place orders off the drive thru menu.  The other side there is a diner counter, retro stools and plush booths so that you can sit down and savor your meal on a plate.  For some reason, the diner side is a magnet for senior citizens, police officers and firefighters.  \\n\\nAside from the Chick-Fil-A chicken, the food is amazingly average.  The breakfast items (Grits, Eggs, Toast) are all good but in a standard way.  The lunch items Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potato Casserole, Greens) are on par with standard southern cafeteria food.  Everything is tasty and filling even if unimaginative.\\n\\nI do like the fact that they display the calorie information right on the menu.  I'm there to consume all things buttery and fried but I appreciate having full information.  I'm pretty sure that other diners like being able to make informed decisions too.  \\n\\nThree stars for the food with a fourth added for service.  Many of the waitresses have been working at this same location for 15+ years; their length of service is on their name tags.  They have southern sweetness on lock.  No matter which one of them serves me I'm almost guaranteed to be called Sweetie, Honey or Sugar at some point.\\n\\nThe Dwarf House is a good place for a down-home southern meal and courteous service.

Let me first start by saying this: I get that this is a celebrity sponsored restaurant/bar and that the \\"said\\" celebrity (in this case T.I.) probably has nothing to do with he day to day operations nor the management of the joint - so this review is in no way a reflection of him as an artist; in other words, Keep Buying TI music.\\n\\nSadly, this establishment is run by mostly young African American people and the care/customer service is reflective of today's \\"all about me\\" youth culture. I was highly disappointed in this place after hearing so much hype about it. Like most predominately AA clubs/bars/restaurants, there is what is commonly referred to as the 'black tax', meaning - you're out almost $100 before you even walk in the place and purchase anything on a menu. For example:\\n\\n$20 to valet park (no validation) \\n$20 cover after 11p\\n$20 dress code DOWNGRADE - meaning - sneakers, sweatsuits, Tims, hats, or anything else the bouncer deems not upscale dress. \\n$12-15 for premium, non-well liquor. \\n\\nSo, what is the real message that 925 is trying to send - We want an upscale clientele with an option to downgrade??? Talk about bi-polar.\\n\\nI went to the bar to order a drink (trying to give the place a chance), the waitress stood at the bar updating her FaceBook while myself and about 4 other customers waited for her to turn around. I did my best to get her attention respectfully, which in turn was met with attitude as if I was bothering her..wayminent: aren't you at work??\\n\\nThe drinks were the typical over-iced, 2 oz. pour with the rest mixer - I didn't expect anything less but for $12 for a Bacardi & Coke, I was left feeling like what was the point. (Tip: Pre-Game or have your lady sneak in the airplane sized bottles of spirits)  We chose to go to the balcony section featuring the Hookah ( my guests wanted that) and what did I discover: YEP the infamous Reserved VIP area...translation: pay to sit under the awning and be seen (that's the other $40 part of the 'black tax'). Being a non-baller, I sat on the peripheral of the VIP area and jammed to the sounds of - wait, there was no music on the balcony!!! WTF? The entertainment was the TV over the bar. WE decided we had enough so we proceeded to the downstairs areas. The elevator only fits about six, FYI and only goes two floors down.\\n\\nFloor 3 was bar/private party seemed like everyone was enjoying themselves. Floor 2 much of the same, but I think that this was actually the restaurant part. Couldn't tell because the way the walkway/bar area/make shift dance floor was set up, left me confused. Anyway, the walkway was lined with more \\"baller seats\\" that you had to pre-pay for. After one more drink and being stalked by the photographer, I was ready to go (rhet-ta-go)\\n\\nThe positive take-away from this place was the DJ - Frank Ski...wayminent, doesn't he have a club on Peachtree Street???

On top of that, their atm was broken. Long story short we had to get out of line, walk back to the car, and wait again in line.

I'll just stop and say service was not good.  I had the bouillabaisse and my wife had scallops.  The bouillabaisse was so under seasoned it made me sad.  The seafood in it (1/2 lobster, scrod, mussels, shrimp & clams) were all cooked well, but just under seasoned.  I ate the seafood and left the broth and others stuff in the bowl.

I eat at the Brazilian Steakhouse in Manchester NH twice a week and this is nothing compared to that. I've eaten at other Brazilian steakhouse restaurants and this by far was horrible. 3.00 per can of soda was a little steep. 5.10 for a lemonade was out of control.

I got the Fish and Chips roll and it was way better than the roll I got the first time I was here but it wasn't anything special.\\n\\nSince it was a full house, it was really noisy. I didn't mind it but at one point we we couldn't even hear ourselves talk and literally yelling at each other because of one table behind us being obnoxiously loud. It's a small place and to hear their entire conversation is not something i want to listen to during my whole meal. \\n\\nFood was ok, it came quick but I ended up having a really annoying dinner listening to someone's wedding turn into a disaster and the servers constantly reminding us they're \\"closing at 10pm\\", \\"we close in 5 mins\\", \\"1 min\\"  and \\" we're closed now\\".

So 3.5/5 in terms of overall quality. \\n\\nVeggie sunomono was severely lacking in a nice vinegar flavour as I found it to be quite bland and warm by the item it arrived. Came with slices of cucumber and tomato. 2/5 \\n\\nChopped scallops roll was pretty average, nothing special to write about and I'd give it a solid 4/5 as again, for some reason the flavour was very subtle and almost bland. \\n\\nThe sunny roll was the best, however I found a big hair inside after I had already chewed up a piece of the roll for quite some time so I'm extremely disappointed with that. It was a spicy tuna with deep fried yam on top which in terms of flavour, was a solid 5/5 but the hair drops it down to a 3. \\n\\nOtherwise overall review of this place is a 3, since it was pretty average.

Get the meatballs for apps, but any pasta option will be delicious.  Fairly priced and limited seating so get there early or prepare to wait.\\n\\nI've been meaning to try Ask for Luigi for at least a year now since it's appeared as one of Canada's Top 50 Restaurants.  \\nLocated on the very edge of Gastown (seriously, not even close to Gastown), but closer to Chinatown, Ask for Luigi looks like it's been remodelled from an old house on the corner of the street.  There's street parking, but it's hard to find free parking (I'm always on the hunt for free parking!).  I got there at 6:30pm on a Thursday evening and was told to wait for a table of 2.  The hostess took our name and number and said the wait would be 60-90 mins!  Holy sh*ts!!  But I was desperate to try Ask for Luigi and I'm no foreigner to long lines so my bf and I decided to walk around until the hostess texted us.  \\n\\nShortly before 8pm, we got a text that our table would be ready shortly.  This restaurant is tiny (seriously like the bottom level of a small house) and seats probably less than 50 people at once.  The menu is limited and I've noticed (having read a lot of reviews) that it changes occasionally.   I think the chef just mixes up the pastas and toppings and sauces, but overall the general pantry in the back probably has all the same ingredients at a given time.  The appetizers are all standard and the wine list is good but not extensive for an Italian restaurant.  \\n\\nOur order:\\nMeatballs - The meatballs were probably the best I've ever had! It comes with 3 but large enough for a good sized app and they're filled with cheese, raisins and pine nuts! Absolutely amazing and I know it might sound weird but everything is soft and moist once it's served and I highly recommend it.\\nTagliatelle with chicken liver and pancetta - I preferred the tagliatelle over the papperdelle, while my bf preferred the papperdelle.  The tagliatelle had a more earthy, rich and creamy flavor to it.  Much more complex with the chicken liver and salty pancetta.  \\nDuck ragu papperdelle - The papperdelle tasted exactly like what I thought it would.  It had plenty of duck and ragu and I just love papperdelle pasta in general (so thick and it's a good mouthful).  The safer choice is definitely the papperdelle but if you're feeling adventurous, try the tagliatelle.  \\nThe pasta is all made in-house and fresh every day and you can feel that difference in the texture and bite.  \\n\\nOur bill came to a total just over $60 after tax and tip.  I had an amazing time and stuffed full even without dessert (although I wish I had, seriously regret it).  The service was neither the best nor the worst.  There's plenty of people working on a Thursday night but I'm not going to dock points for average service (it was quite busy even when we left).  Our total time spent dining was probably just over an hour. My only complaint is the wait time since they also don't take reservations (I swear they used to!).  If you're up for an early dinner or don't mind the wait though, I highly recommend Ask for Luigi.  It's a good place for a special event or a dinner for 2.  One of the best Italian restaurants out there across Canada (and I've had a lot in Toronto) and worth the visit."},{"name":"Upper Left Roasters","address":"1204 SE Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"amazing food, great coffee, and friendly employees!!!  i will definitely continue to come here! lots of space in here too."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My first review for 2014! \\n\\nA very popular small doughnut place owned by two guys named Kenneth Pogson & Tres Shannon.

And it turned out that there was one lonely two-top in the middle of the family room available. \\n\\nWe ordered a couple beers and checked out the menu. We decided on some garlic knots, an Italian chef salad and a large #6 (Sausage, Ricotta, and Roasted Red Peppers). \\n\\nOkay, so our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. For sure. The salad was great. The knots were not my favourite, but they were not bad. They were more like big rolls than what I am used to. Then came the pie... It was a behemoth.

I ordered the loaded queso bacon waffle fries as a starter, with 5 Sweet Fire & 5 4th Degree Burn level buffalo wings to follow.\\n\\nService utensils include the traditional Hooter's style wooden plate with knife, fork, napkins & wetnaps, which were brought out after I placed my order.\\n\\nStarter:\\n\\nThe bacon on the queso fries, while not crisp, was certainly cooked at the restaurant and I appreciate the effort. The queso was plain and not at all spicy. The waffle fries were terrible, however. The fries were very bitter, a classic sign of oil oxidation. This really concerned me as most of the menu is fried. I brought this up to a manager upon leaving, who seemed especially confused as to what I meant. This concerned me even more as this is a basic concept in deep frying.\\n\\nHere's the thing, this is a new restaurant; less than 2 months old as of this review. The management and crew should be trained on proper maintenance of the fryers and what can happen if you abuse shortening. That nobody was aware of food being bitter as a symptom of bad fryer oil makes me suspicious of whether they've even changed their oil yet.\\n\\nWings:\\nThe wings were brought out when I was less than halfway through my starter, which is very aggravating. The wings looked great. Woody's breads the wings, which I appreciate(you can get them unbreaded, once again borrowing from Hooter's & Roosters. The Sweet Fire were great and I have no complaints. The buffalo wings are offered at 5 'burn levels' with 5 being the hottest. I got the 4th degree wings. While the wings had the appropriate level of heat, the flavor just wasn't right. Normally, a mild wing sauce is Frank's red hot sauce with liquid butter mixed in, with the heat increasing as the amount of butter decreases. These wings are hotter than straight red hot sauce, so I suspect some sort of capsaicin powder is used. I think these wings lacked depth of flavor that could have been reached with more vinegar, a consequence of not using a pepper sauce as the main form of heat.\\n\\nEven though I'm fine with the level of heat, my face was still messy and certain reactions like sweat and a runny nose are involuntary. Unfortunately, my meal came with only 2 napkins. 1 napkin soaked up my messy fingers and the other napkin wiped my nose.\\n\\nService:\\nAt this point there has been no call backs asking if the fries were ok or asking about a drink refill, so I had to wait several more minutes for the server, Sierra to come back.\\n\\nSierra came back with the check. I asked about more napkins, as my hands were still a mess and my nose was about to start running again. I'm just about halfway through my wings at this point.\\n\\nSierra returned with 2 more napkins and I was never asked about a refill in my unsweetened tea. Those napkins and all wetnaps were completely used up by he time I went to the bathroom to finish cleaning my hands and face. The bathroom had a strong fecal odor and no paper towels.\\n\\nMy suggestions:\\nTrain management and staff on bad frying as well as the enemies of oil. Establish a strict routine for cleaning the fryers and changing the oil.\\n\\nTrain servers on making timely call backs and not serving the main before the starter is done.\\n\\nClean the bathrooms and stock them with the appropriate supplies.\\n\\nSince so much of this place is copied from Hooter's, perhaps copy their use of paper towel holders at every table.\\n\\n*************************************************\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nI have returned, reordering 5 of the Sweet Fire wings as a starter, then ordered a build-your-own burger with habanero cheddar as well as waffle fries after I finished the wings.\\n\\nThe bitterness is gone from the wings as well as the waffle fries. I still only got 2 napkins with my service setting. I really wish they'd add paper towels rolls to the tables or at least start patrons off with 4 or 5 napkins. I asked for more when my wings came out.\\n\\nService was better, but it was still a full 30 minutes before a a call back for a refill occurred. The check only dropped after confirmation that I was finished, so THAT was definitely an improvement.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place now and hope they continue to improve."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"Local taco company that makes you feel at home.Quaint location with a country feel.

When we were seated, we ordered the frog legs, coconut shrimp, lobster fried rice, spring rolls and fried goat cheese, and Mac n cheese. Frog legs were a first for me and I wasn't a fan - it was cooked very well though. The coconut shrimp was delicious and came with a sweet dipping sauce. The breading on the shrimp was very hard and crunchy, and was uncomfortable to eat. Same with the goat cheese - cheese was creamy and a little tart but was very hard to bite into. The Mac and cheese was just okay, a little bland and I didn't like the use of bowtie pasta.

Dish needed salt and while the chicken was well seasoned otherwise, some bites were greasier and less enjoyable than others. Mac was ok, very seasoned and cheesy but kind of mushy and unimpressive. The fried kale on top that I thought would add crunch and interest was ultimately just a greasy kale chip.

When I asked her to take them off because they never came, the manager showed up with them. Then, as usual, the meal and our conversation was interrupted by his apologies and explanations.

How is that possible?I've been coming here for 12 years now. It's got me through some dark days. If it wasn't for Reale's I may have starved after my divorce.\\n      I was first introduced to Reale's by a friend after I lamented about missing home and not being able to get a cannoli or a decent slice of pizza in Texas.\\n      Reale's is a family owned restaurant and walking in takes me back in time and makes me reminisce about those neighborhood Italian places I grew up on.\\n      First of all Reale's has the best pizza in Texas, hands down. Anyone that says different is a blasphemer and I will burn them at the stake.(That's what they used to do to blasphemers, right? Or was that witches?). Fuggedaboutit! My only complaint is that they took the full size Sicilian pizza off the menu.There's a smaller version but it's just not the same. Rumor has it, you can still get the full size. You just have to order ahead.\\n      Reale's is not a get in get out type of restaurant. Italian dinner is to be eaten at a leisurely pace. And that's just the way it is here. The service is good and efficient without being overbearing. Courses aren't rushed out one after the other. Growing up Italian, meals were an important part of life. It's a time for conversations and joyous gatherings. Bonds are formed and battles forged. Expect to take your time when you come here.\\n      Order some wine or an Italian beer(I reccomend the Illuminati and the Moretti). If you're at the bar waiting on your table, Dave will take care of you. While you're in there you'll probably meet some transplanted New Yorkers enjoying their drinks and dinner bantering with Bob or Gino. \\n      Start off with the Calamari. It's fantastic and tasty. The sauce that accompanies it is the Marinara al Diavolo. Spicy!!\\n      The breadsticks can be doughy at times and are kind of bleh. And the salads are nothing to write home about(or Yelp for that matter).\\n       I pretty much have had everything on the menu. Some of my favorites are the Lasagna(Only Mom can do it better), Eggplant Parmigiana(Simply Outstanding!), Meatballs(Tender and Homemade), and Veal Picatta(Mmmm!). \\n      Bob will be coming around to check on how your evening is going as Frankie and Dean croon in the background.\\n      Finish the evening off with one of Gino's Cannolis. Delectable!\\n      Trying to order togo over the phone can be trying especially when dealing with new staff who don't know the menu or anything about Italian food when trying to substitute items. As happened to me when I tried to substitute Rigatoni for Linguini or when i tried to explain how I just wanted a cheese calzone(Menu choices are with meat or spinach)\\n     To sum this up: If you want good basic Italian comfort food Reale's is your place. And if you're searching for that perfect New York Style Pizza in North Austin, your search can happily end here.

It was probably the best part of dinner. I definitely recommend it. Everything after this was just downhill.\\n\\nThe seared tuna was under-seasoned and the vegetables underneath weren't anything to rave about. \\n\\nThe lamb shank was dry and the accompanying beans were chalky and undercooked. The bright yellow sauce sitting under the lamb hardly tasted of anything. The pickled pepper just felt disconnected and random, but it offered a much needed burst of flavor and spice.\\n\\nThe filet mignon was cut absurdly thin and over-cooked--We asked for medium-rare, but it was definitely medium-well and chewy.\\n\\nThe beef cheek was super delicious, but it definitely was not worth $32. It was good but not memorable or unique. I just had a Brunswick stew at a BBQ place earlier that day that gave me the same indifference.\\n\\nOverall, the presentation was extremely low-brow for the price point. Seriously, I've spent not much more elsewhere for a truly gourmet, mind-blowing experience. The table that we were given was literally a tarp placed over what seemed to be an old firepit and none of our plates or glasses could sit up straight because of the uneven surface.\\n\\nOn top of bad food, all the staff seemed on edge and unhappy. When we ordered drinks, the bartender was short and snapped at us and just walked away. At the end of the meal, we were obviously unhappy because we barely touched our plates, but our waiter didn't even bother to assuage the situation.\\n\\nOne good thing about this place is that the patio lighting at sunset made for AMAZING photos, but this does not warrant another visit.

However, my last (ever) visit to Element Bistro was so awful I believe sometching needs to be said. Saturday night at seven thirty we arrive at the restaurant, it appears to not be busy(I did not see the rooftop, there were maybe five tables seated in the large downstairs section) We are immediately greeted and sat at a sticky table next to the kitchen and handed dirty, food stained, and wrinkled menus. I am assuming the manager is who sat us, but the last we would see of her that evening is when she comes back with a blue and stained-brown with filth rag to re-wipe our table, somehow still leaving it sticky? Cue our waitress who greets us in a timely manner, although awkwardly picks a crumb off our now twice wiped yet still dirty table. Not her fault, just worth the mention. My Boyfriend orders a drink and an appetizer, both arrive quickly. Him and I banter about how we first loved this restaurant but each visit seems to have gone downhill as far as the food quality is concerned. Let it be noted that when paying near-fine dinning prices, I expect well executed and consistent food quality. That has not been the case at Element, but since we live so close it was nice to have a restaurant nearby that was.... good-enough. This is where our visit goes way downhill. My Boyfriend orders the seafood trio, which consists of fried seafood and French fries, and I order a small Cesar salad. I was mostly there to order dessert, but unfortunately, never had the chance. A significant amount of time passes when we start to wonder \\"where is our food?\\". As thirty to forty minutes had passed all the other tables downstairs had left and we were left alone with one table across the way finishing their meal. At this point our waitress quickly walks by us and throws a \\"free drink on your next visit\\" coupon on our table and says I know your food is taking a while, then scurries off without offering further explanation or asking if we need anything at that time. We felt somewhat relieved that our wait had been acknowledged, but after another twenty minutes passed without our meal arriving we started to get really antsy. ZERO food had left the kitchen for a solid 30 minutes. We were watching the waitstaff sit and roll silverware and take out trash while we sat there ignored. I wanted to flag down our waitress so I could go ahead and order dessert but could not. I finally get the attention of another waitress and inform her that we have been waiting an hour for our food at this point (one plate of fried food and a salad with no meat).  She goes to the kitchen and returns with my salad and tells us the other food is being plated. My small salad came in an unusually tiny bowl, although this was besides the point, as we waited ANOTHER ten minutes for our Seafood Trio. At this point, my Boyfriend addresses one of the male servers rolling silverware  and informs him that we are about to leave, to which the server replies \\"go ahead, there's a McDonald's up the street\\". \\nAs previously mentioned, after working over a decade in the service industry, I am more than understanding of a busy or short staffed restaurant, long wait times, food mishaps, and the like. But our experience at a restaurant slow enough for the waitstaff to be closing shop, with no food leaving the kitchen at all for half and hour, and waiting over an hour for a plate of fried food is absolutely unacceptable. We were offered no explanation as to why this was happening and were insulted by an employee at the end of our experience.

He was super knowledgeable of the entire menu, and accommodating to my mom's seafood allergy.

It was definitely a bit on the spicy side, but if you like that I'd definitely recommend. My mom had a champagne cocktail of some sort and enjoyed it. \\n\\nApps: The goat cheese mashed potato ball was very unique and good without being too heavy.

I really wasn't feeling that. We can have brunch at any Ritz carlton here is Cali, why not see what ATL is working with and I only had 2 days to do so. So I convinced him and we were on our way. He was so worried about it being packed. So we made a deal, if Mary mac's was packed, we would go to Fat matts bbq right at opening LOL. We even said we'll eat at both spots. Our minds were much more greedy than our stomachs! So we drive in the light rain to this lovely spot and I hop out and ask the hostess, how long was the wait and she said no wait! HOLLLLLLA! It was 11:45am on sunday so get here before the church rush!  Another hostess walked us to our seats. The staff is on the young side but playful and still professional. When we were walking to our seats, I noticed this place has many little dining rooms to dine in. The one we sat in was a little quiet but I still couldn't hear other tables conversations, thank god!\\n\\n\\n\\n  The service here is great. Seriously every where we dined, the service was every bit of Southern comfort! The waiter was so helpful especially with the menu. When we first say, we saw a paper where we guessed you fill in what you want under certain categories. We were confused as F! But the kind server  helped us on how to write out what you want lol. We started with cocktails but we had to wait because in this state you can buy or get a drink until 12pm! I wonder how hell early Brunch works out in these parts! Not a problem, it was only a 15 minute wait for drank LOL. So we looked over the menu and I seriously was in a soul food paradise! I seriously was about to order 2 meals, one for there and one to go haha. I mean I was dead set on wings but I saw they had oxtails for the weekend and that's why I was thinking hmmmmm two meals please LOL. I actually ordered one because we already ordered enough food and I didn't want to look like a total fatazz! So the breakdown :\\n\\n\\n  \\n  Bread basket: What a lovely variety of breads. That crack pork cornbread,mini cinnamon rolls and these other rolls that are so buttery and a very small hint of sweet.  I did taste testing of all three BUT I did take them back with me. Damn good basket of breads. A good amount for two people.\\n \\n\\n  Pot Likker with cracklin' bread: Since we were newbies the kind waiter gave us a taster of this and OMG something that sounds so simple, tastes so frakin good! It's just the broth from the mustard greens and crumble the corn bread into the soup. The corn bread had bits of pork in it!!!!! Damn if I had a sick day, this would hit the spot! Especially if I added some chili flakes for an extra kick! I will get a bowl of this next time!\\n\\n Spicy Deep-Fried \\"Mudbugs\\" : Basically fried crawdaddies :) I actually enjoyed this appetizer but the Italian was not feeling it. He thought it was supposed to be full crawfish. Shell, heads and all. I'm glad it wasn't. I'm not ready for the full crawfish experience just yet :p The breading wasn't to thick and they were fried just right. Lots of flavor but it did miss the spicy factor. I did enjoy the jalapeno tarter sauce. I'd order these again but with a group of friends.\\n\\n Oxtails meal: Every meal comes with two sides but my greedy ass ordered three on top the rice and gravy that comes with the oxtails so basically 4 sides :D My dish came with 5 or 6 oxtails in gravy on a bed of white rice. The flavors were there but I will say they were just a wee bit overcooked and it made them a challenge to eat in a ladylike way. This lady that kept staring at me, ordered the same and she yelled at our kind waiter and told him they were overcooked. He was toooo nice to be spoken to that way! Once I took them back to the hotel, I F'd them up like a cave woman! They know how to season the stars of the show most definitely and the dish would have been 5 stars but the overcooking of meat made it a 3.\\n\\n The sides: They come on a plate of their own HAHA. I choose mac and cheese, greens and cornbread stuffing. The greens were good but I should have chosen the mustard greens to get that taste! You know what I mean. The mac and cheese was fresh and hot but could have been seasoned more with Lawry's and could have been ooey gooey with cheese. The stuffing was passable but I was missing the bits of gizzards like my moms stuffing. That was seasoned well, it just didn't have the out standing taste of your thanksgiving kind of stuffing. The sides menu is quite large, so if I ever get the chance to come back, I will try three more other sides next time LOL.\\n\\n Peach cobbler: This was good peach cobbler but it was missing something. I wish it came out super hot with ice cream on top. I didn't know about the ice cream til I looked at the menu when writing this review! LOL! Cest la vie :p  Next time I'm getting the bread pudding!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Overall I enjoyed my meal here and I think everyone should try this ATL food destination!!!"},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Skipped the line & ordered through yelp online.

Genius! That saved me and my friend time and minimized hunger time. Menu was super simple, 3 choices. My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the Miso Ramen. The order came really quickly. It was piping hot and actually SO GOOD. I was surprised. I haven't found a ramen I liked other than Snappy Ramen so this was unexpected.\\n\\nThe broth was super warm and hearty. The noodles were thicker than most, which I like. The only 2 complaints I have are 1) the meat was TOO thinly sliced. Your girl loves meat.

If these 2 things were addressed, I would've given this ramen an 8. Overall I'd give it a 7.\\n\\nThis restaurant is tiny! Like really tiny.

We walked in and were greeted and seated right away. We were not expecting this at all for a Sunday afternoon, but like I said the restaurant is pretty big. The ambiance is fairly causal and cozy. Once we were seated we were greeted promptly by our waitress. We were told about the specials, but just opted to order from the menu. We ordered fried okra for an appetizer even though you're given complimentary bread and collard green soup. The fried okra was good and the horseradish sauce was a nice compliment to it. The fried okra was nothing spectacular, but was good.\\n\\nFor entrees I ordered the Shrimp and cheese grits with fried green tomatoes and mac n' cheese as sides. The shrimp and grits I am not a fan of. The grits lacked flavor and the shrimp had too much seasoning. Plus they leave the tails on the shrimp and that is a big pet peeve of mine. I understand some cooks like to leave them on for presentation, but for practical purposes they should be left off. If you're a good chef you can make a good looking plate without tails on the shrimp! The mac n' cheese was good, but it tasted just like the way my grandmother makes  hers and how I make mine. Nothing is wrong with that, but as a restaurant there should be something unique about your recipe instead  of tasting just like \\"average joe's\\" home cooked food. Or maybe that's the point? The fried green tomatoes  are very good though! Cooked perfectly and went well the the horseradish sauce. I think the fried green tomatoes were my favorite out of everything I tried.\\n\\nMy fiance ordered the four piece fried chicken with mac n\\" cheese and whipped potatoes as sides.  The fried chicken was very disappointing. It reminded of fried chicken that I could get at a low grade buffet restaurant. It was dry and lacked flavor!

We were only there for a few hours; we did the Boston Freedom Trail walk and wandered around some of the shops in an area with a lot of Italian restaurants. The boyfriend had Bookmarked this place on Yelp for lunch because they were supposed to have a great selection of oysters.\\n\\nUnion Oyster House is famous as America's oldest restaurant. At least, there were signs all over the restaurant proclaiming that. The restaurant was a lot larger than it looked from the street. Because we were there on a Thursday around 11:30 a.m., it wasn't very crowded. We could easily find a table for four. \\n\\nThere's a lot to choose from on the menu, and it's a little pricier. Yet, I enjoyed all the seafood we ordered so much that I wouldn't hesitate to go back if we're ever in the area. Sidenote: enjoy that fresh cornbread. It's so moist, buttery and served warm. If I had more room in my stomach, I would have asked for more bread! \\n\\nHere's what we ordered: \\n\\n\\"Lobster Salad Roll\\": I had my heart set on ordering a lobster roll during our time in Boston. Because there were so many items on the menu I wanted to get, the boyfriend graciously offered to get the lobster salad roll as his entr√©e so I could order something else (but still have half of his sandwich). All sandwiches are served with French fries, cole slaw, lettuce, tomato and dill pickles. The lobster roll was just as glorious as I imagined it would be. The lobster chunks were huge, meaty and oh-so-fresh. I loved this version because it didn't have a lot of mayo in it, either. The sandwich had a refreshing, more citrusy flavor (especially when we squeezed the lime over it), and it really did taste like a salad in sandwich form. The bread was lightly toasted and buttery - absolute perfection. This lived up to my expectations and I was so satisfied after! \\n\\n\\"Freshly Shucked Oysters\\": For half a dozen, these were $16.50. Instead of having them at our table, the boyfriend and I went to the oyster bar and sat at the counter so we could watch the shucking action (before our entrees arrived). There weren't too many people sitting there, so we could leisurely watch the shucking process and our oysters were served. I only ate one out of six, but the boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the variety. The oysters were a decent size, and I was just happy that they didn't taste overly salty. We got back to our table just in time for our entrees to come out. \\n\\n\\"Union Favorites\\": I was indecisive, but this platter features the best of all worlds. It had a trio of a mini lobster cake, crab cake and fish cake that was pan seared and served on a bed of mixed greens with roasted potatoes and red peppers. All entrees were served with house-baked corn bread, vegetables and potatoes. The little cakes were lightly breaded, and I couldn't really tell the difference between them until I bit into each one. The fried fish cake was light and flaky on the inside. I liked the lobster cake and could tell it was lobster because of the larger, meatier chunks. My favorite had to be the crab cakes - I'm a sucker for crab cakes, and these were some of the best I've tasted. There was so much lump crab inside, and the exterior was a delectable golden brown. I didn't eat much of the greens or potatoes (I was full after eating half of the lobster roll and all my cornbread), but the boyfriend enjoyed my veggies. The roasted potatoes were great too; they reminded me of a side you'd get with a breakfast entr√©e. \\n\\n\\"Broiled Boston Scrod\\": Apparently this is a traditional New England dish. It's a younger cod that's crusted with seasoned breadcrumbs. This was a game changer for us - both of my boyfriend's parents ordered this as their entr√©e (one was breaded; one was plain). My boyfriend says he remembers having scrod when he was younger, but he didn't remember it being this flavorful. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between this and the cod we had later during our trip. But, I have to say, that delicious, savory breadcrumb seasoning made all the difference. The scrod was thinly filleted but it was still a good portion. That, paired with potatoes, was delicious. I wouldn't mind ordering this for myself next time. \\n\\n\\"Homemade Lump Crab Cakes\\": I was eyeing these for a while and was tempted to order them, but I ended up getting the sampler instead. These crab cakes are served with a lemon aioli. Since this was my favorite of the three breaded cakes I got in my sampler platter, I would just get the crab cakes straight-up as an entr√©e next time. \\n\\n\\"Fish and Chips\\": I'm sure the fish and chips here are good; they're served with coleslaw. Probably before ordering it, though, I would ask what type of fish is used and if the chips are actual chips (like potato chips) or if they're French fries."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite burgers in town.

The view is of course beautiful. And food was pretty good. But the service is horrendous for an upscale dining place. But let me start this off by saying that I usually don't complain about these things and I'm only upset because I was expecting the restaurant to live up to its caliber. \\n\\nFor the appetizers, we had the beef carpaccio which is the best I've ever had and the tuna tartare which was great and fresh as well. The calamari on the other hand was mediocre, I've had way better. \\n\\nFor the main course I had the seafood cioppino which was good but the bread that came with it was not good. Others also had the lobster ravioli which was flavorful. \\n \\nSo let's talk about service. Coming to such an upscale place I did not expect to run into such an unfriendly staff. First off, our server did not smile at all throughout the evening and I felt like I was not wanted in the restaurant. That made for a very uncomfortable experience throughout the entire evening. She barely spoke two words to us except for when she wanted to up sell some drinks to our kids. Secondly, our utensils were not switched for cleans ones between the appetizer and main course. Thirdly, I would say thank you to the food runners and our server and I don't think they bothered to make eye contact with me and only half the time I got a \\"you're welcome\\" as a response. Fourthly, she didn't give us any shell bowls for our seafood so I had to put my empty shells on my bread plate. And lastly, the part that angers me the most is that we came here for my mother's birthday and when they served the birthday dessert with a candle on it, our table was not cleared off. We all had our entrees still on the table and that is just absolutely unacceptable. Because the entrees were on the table we thought we had time to go to the bathroom before dessert was served. So when my mom got her birthday dessert she was basically the only one at the table. How sad. \\n\\nIt's like no one in the restaurant bothered to take care of us from start to finish. I'm really disappointed in the way they treat their customers and maybe it was just this one night's wait staff.

We had a dozen and half of oysters and half a dozen of clams as well as a cup of clam chowder. \\n\\nThe oysters and clams were freshly shucked to order. I would recommend sitting by the oyster bar if you are ordering oysters, as I was sitting I noticed that a lot it the table orders were sitting by the counter for while before a server would pick it up and bring it to the table, sitting at the bar you get your oysters as soon as they are shucked, can't get any fresher than that right! The chowder was thick, hearty and flavorful! I was shocked at how delicious it was. \\n\\nWhy the 2 star you ask? The main entrees were the reason... We ordered a Caesar Salad to share, my husband opted for the seafood platter and I opted for the broiled fresh Boston scrod which came with a plate of asparagus.

The Caesar salad was good but nothing special just your typical Caesar salad. \\n\\nOverall I would give this restaurant a 2.5 stars only because of the clam chowder!

During this whole time, our waitress only came to check on us ONE time. When we tried to flag her down, she proceeded to put her finger up and say one minute as if we were bugging her. When she did come over, I had already put my coat on ready to leave.

Do NOT bring your German or Japanese business associates here, they will not be happy with you at all. I travel a lot, so I see their point. We have politely for our first round of drinks and it takes a long time, while others around us get quick service. So of course we have asked, and the problem is that I don't pre-tip.

One of our clients always asks to go back there, but he's from Thailand and his culture is to just let loose and this is the place to do it.... HEAVY drinking and the bartenders don't shut anybody down no matter how obnoxious they are. The place attracts heavy drinking on the dance floor, management encourages it, spilt drinks, urine on the floor in the men's room, etc. basically everything you'd expect from that kind of crowd. It's mostly a 45-65 there. The women are good sized, and when they take the dance floor watch out because they'll smack into your table while you eat, it's like eating on a roller coaster when they collide. It's a small place, I realize, but the kind of people that go there are VERY aggressive. Much fewer men on the dance floor, but they run back and forth and spoil it for the rest.

Reviewing McMenamins Kennedy School is going to make my Algebra teacher happy because I will have to use advanced mathematics as an adult ... just like she said so many times ... to actually calculate a star rating of this large expansive destination in the heart of Portland where the rating really depends on what aspect you are reviewing.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, McMenamins Kennedy School is a hotel with lodging in 57 guestrooms ... many in old classrooms with a chalkboard, memories of failed tests, and pre-teen innocence lingering in the air. Lodging is the X in my review equation because I haven't had the chance to spend the night, yet. Lesson learned ... need to plan a night or two as a surprise for my sweetheart.\\n\\nFor the things I did try at McMenamins, the ratings were all over the playground. The long hallways lined with a mix of bars, party rooms, and historic photos keep the whole vibe of the former Kennedy Elementary School (1915 - 1975). It's 2 parts cool and 1 part too strong of a flashback. Stepping into the men's restroom in the boy's locker room looked, felt, and smelt just a little too real. 4-stars for the cool vibe.\\n\\nWatching a movie in the old-school auditorium on an old couch drinking beer and eating pizza was 5-star hipness.  This isn't Imax quality screening or digital sound, but it was pure Portlandia gold. The movies seemed to vary through out the day, so, check online for one that fits your mood ... or don't and just show up like a cool person and see whatever is on next ... with a beer to keep you happy.\\n\\nOk, so, the Courtyard Restaurant was not so great. It wasn't even so so ... except for some awesome Wild Mushroom Pasta ($15.50) with flavorful sauteed mushrooms and shallots in an Alfredo Sauce on Bowtie Pasta. It might be too powerful a flavor punch for those that don't like mushrooms, but I liked it. \\n\\nAn order of waiter-recommended Spicy Chicken Wings ($13) weren't spicy or special, but they were so much better than the 1-star  Dungeness Crab Pizza ($12.50) with ice cold Crab Meat clumped on top of a cold Pizza completely lacking in taste except cold meh. \\n\\nOf course, the locally-brewed draft beers hit the spot for me. Can't go wrong with a seasonal like the Kris Kringle Holiday Ale. Olivia tried a super sweet, but unmemorable daily special cocktail that I've completely forgotten.\\n\\nThe worst part of dinner at the Courtyard Restaurant was horribly slow and inattentive service. Each table near us had a different server and we know this because our server was like never there ... so we had plenty of time to wonder what was going on. We were jealous of a party of 4 that came in 30 minutes after us (thanks Yelp Check-in time stamp), but got drinks AND food before us. We almost walked out twice ... after a 20-minute wait for a greeting and 25-minute wait for drinks. We totally bailed on dessert and went elsewhere to avoid NOT seeing our server any more.\\n\\nDespite the hit-n-miss food and subpar service at the Courtyard Restaurant, I'm a fan of McMenamins Kennedy School. I may not be good at algebra, but the fresh draft beers, overall back-to-school vibe, and totally hip movie theater experience all add up to 4 stars and likely return visits for just about anything except dinner."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Perfect example of how in this country, gimmick = marketing = success.

The brisket was a little different than I imagined, but tasted just fine. I do wish they would cut the fat off of the meet though. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE: I would say it has a business casual atmosphere that can easily go formal depending on the occasion. I wouldn't show up here in a t-shirt and jeans because I would feel too out of place. Unfortunately it was really hot where we were sitting and humid. It was the area near the pothos plant wall. It became really uncomfortable for my party after an hour.\\n\\nSERVICE: The service wasn't that good. Our server was nice, but the amount of time between check-ins and the delivery of our dinner was too long. I think it took about an hour to get our food. Luckily we ordered tons of appetizers to hold us over. Those came out fast. \\n\\nPARKING: The parking lot looks like a maze, but just follow the traffic to the complimentary valet. Coming out they were fairly fast and we didn't ha s to wait long before our cars were brought out to us.

A fairly large, attractive and modern space, that seems to be constantly packed with college students.  No reservations, but you can put your name down and they will text you when your table is ready, so you can wander around nearby Harvard Square.  There is also a small, comfortable waiting area in the restaurant.\\n\\nI enjoyed both ramen we tried, which were top-notch (in my admittedly limited experience).  In particular, the tender sliced pig cheeks, which you add to the separate bowl of ramen, were an interesting change from the usual slice of pork.  I will have to say, however, that the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen had an extremely rich and porky broth.  For me, with the added pig cheeks on top, it was just too rich.  Next time I will probably go for something lighter.  YMMV of course.\\n\\nPersonally, I probably still prefer the wonderful Smoked Miso Ramen at Strip-T's in Watertown, and the Spicy Miso Ramen at Little Big Diner in Newton.  I guess I'm attracted by more non-traditional versions, and the hipper environs.

I had one meal I didn't like at all, the Guac burger.  The veggie patty was just like you'd get in the frozen food section of a supermarket.  I had hoped for, and expected, a home-made veggie burger.  They also charged me a lot of extra money for a gluten-free roll.  \\nI decided to try them again because a coworker raves about the Kale Caesar salad.  Yes, it was $10.95 but I got 2 meals out of it, there was so much salad.  \\nToday I wanted to try something different so chose the Detox salad.  Placed my order online and went over at specified time.  The girl at the counter waited on me and I told her I had placed my order online.  She said, Oh, Ok, they are making it.  Several minutes went by, and I started seeing orders come out for other people, so I went up to ask if she could check on my order.  She looked at her computer screen and said there was no order in my name.  I told her I had paid online with my credit card, so the order should be there.  I was about to take out my phone to show them but thankfully a male employee standing nearby overheard the conversation and came right over.  He whisked out a tablet and lo and behold, there was my order, just like it should be.  The bad part was, this salad is not \\"made to order\\", it is made in the morning and put out in the self-service refrigerated case.  He grabbed a bag, grabbed the salad and dressing and apologized for the confusion.  I applaud him for stepping in, but I wasted over 10 minutes for nothing.

By the time I got back, I had only 15 minutes left to eat.  \\nThis was a staffing thing, which I think is the problem here.  Earlier today, I went in and asked a worker what time they actually opened and he said he didn't know!  The girls at the counter do not seem to understand questions being asked of them.\\nI won't comment on their pricing because their prices are the going rate in this part of town.  We've had an influx of these type restaurants:  Tatte, Chloe, Digg Inn, etc.  Similar menus, similar pricing.  They simply don't open mid-priced restaurants for breakfast/lunch options and no fast food except for Wendy's here.

Took him almost 20 minutes just to bring our drinks out at the beginning of the meal and we didn't even have speciality drinks. The only good thing about the entire meal was the cinnamon rolls. Even the salads were prepared badly. How do you mess up a wedge salad???

That night, we stayed inside. The outdoor, covered patio area looked nice, but there were less people inside and we wanted more privacy. The d√©cor is eclectic and bright; I liked it. Our host was so friendly and nice. He was great.\\n\\nOn the other hand, our waiter was.. OK. I felt bad juju vibes off him, but didn't say anything, thinking it may just be me and a bad radar.

Never been here before, but they treated me like an old friend.\\n\\nStarted with the complementary popovers--perfect cooked, eggy and flavorful inside, perfect crisp and caramelized outside.  Then I had the brussel sprouts salad--unexpected, almost like a special slaw, but more tasty than any coleslaw I'd ever had; unlike most eateries, they went very light on the dressing so you could taste everything.  Intermission was a terrific bourbon-scotch drink they do (I love both liquors, but had never thought to mix them)--just the right balance between smokey and peaty with a citrus zip; this may be my new favorite drink.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor:  get the duck with the raisins marinated in root beer, cooked to the chef's recommended temperature.  Duck is hard to do right, and these folks are pros: perfect salty crispness inside, perfect, juicy tenderness inside. The sauce highlighted the flavor of the duck, didn't overwhelm it.  \\n\\nEnded the night with a surprisingly light sticky toffee pudding.

I felt compelled to write this, in hopes, the restaurant can change their business model. I had 5:30 reservations and were seated at the corner table with 4 friends. Three of us ordered a rib eye but my rib eye was cut into a rectangle looking like a N.Y. Strip.  The rib eye cap, which is the best piece was only 2 inches.  I asked the server, if this was the rib eye because it did not look consistent with the two rib eyes my friends received, circular with lots of\\nEnd cap. He took my rib eye to the Kitchen and returned the same piece to me, confirming it's a rib eye.  The server apologized and stated the butcher cut the piece that way but it is a rib eye.\\n     I don't like making a fuss and almost never send food back. If The Bancroft wants to compete against the other steak establishments, who charge over $50 a steak, they should have trained their staff to better handle this sort of incident.  The server was very attentive and professional. Other restaurants would have trained their staff to send the manager over. The steak should have been replaced, looking like the same cut my other two friends received. Some places, like the Capital Grill would of replaced the steak and not even charge us. I am disappointed with the experience. With drinks, tonight was a $125 mistake. At least, the Dog will be happy with my left overs. (I have pictures of the rib eye but can not upload.)

Get it? Lol. (Post game interview of this bad joke coming soon.) Going here is like getting drizzunk on nice Chardonnay from Napa while enjoying a view of beautiful rolling hills and a perfect sunset. Not like getting wasted with box wine on your best friend's bedroom floor. (Arguably, just as nice, though.) So, wear those nice slacks that you have in your closet. Not the pair of jeans you wipe BBQ sauce on. \\n\\nAnyways, we celebrated my boo-thang's birfday at The Optimist last summer (review long overdue), and we had quite the feast. \\n*****\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nThey're known for their oyster bar and a lot of their shared plates remind me of high-end izakaya plates. Lots of their entrees are very Classic American. What we had:\\n\\n*Shishito Peppers: Nice amount of salt and always plenty to go around. Definitely something worth getting to start off.\\n\\n**Tuna Carpaccio: Absolutely delicious. Definitely recommend and fun to share. \\n\\n**Salmon Carpaccio: Also great and similar to the tuna. \\n\\n**Oysters: They have them from coast-to-coast. Now, I'm not sure whether or not my favorites are still there, but if you like briny and small oysters then get the ones from the Pacific Northwest. (Maybe, specifically Puget Sound?) \\n\\n**Swordfish Steak: Probably my least favorite dish of the night - sort of dry - but not bad. I just wouldn't get it again.\\n\\nFor drinks, they have plenty of wine, beer, and cocktails to pair with your food. I had a few Moscow Mules, and I was set for the rest of my night.\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nWe had to wait a little bit despite making reservations, but it wasn't a big deal. (Just grabbed a drink at their bar.) Regarding table service itself, no qualms here. Definitely top notch, yo. \\n\\nIII. AMBIENCE/ D√âCOR\\nSpacious, gorgeous, and intimate - it's a lovely place for a romantic date or hangout with friends. You could also just stuff your face at the oyster bar by yourself, too. haha. But generally, there are four main areas: patio, oyster bar, main dining room, and bar. \\n\\nThere are lots of places to hangout, but it seems that the patio is where the cool kids are. They have low-hanging white lights dimly shining, corn-hole, and usually live music. Pretty sweet.\\n\\nLots of people complain about parking in this traffic-ridden, I-can't-wait-to-get-the-f****-out-of-my-car metropolitan, and complain about the valet. So, if you live in Atlanta proper, consider taking an Uber or parking in a lot or on the street several blocks down. The Westside is pretty darn safe.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\nPricey for the food, but you're paying for the ambience, service, and the fact that Atlanta doesn't reside on the ocean. --In my humble opinion, though, I think the prices are quite fair. Around $3 for a pretty damn good oyster. $10+ for an appetizer? $15+ for an entree? Totally reasonable.\\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nFun place to dine at!

I was told that he was not going to be allowed to have that beer and that \\"you can take it away from him or we will\\". \\n\\nI walked over to where my friends were having fun, grabbed my boyfriend's beer and went to the bar. I explained the situation to the bartender, who was wonderful about the whole thing, and asked for our money back. I was done with that place. She refunded our money for our four drinks (my friends and come up to the bar and wondered what was going on at that point) and the four of us left. \\n\\nI have never been made to feel so embarrassed and uncomfortable at a bar for having a nice time. Yes, my boyfriend was a little boisterous, but we were playing games and getting into the competition. He was not belligerent or rude to the employees or customers in any way. \\n\\nI feel that those security guards were bored and were on a power trip. They had pegged my boyfriend as someone they could bully and ganged up on us. I'm sure they legitimately felt he was too drunk, but they completely misread the situation and ruined our night. I know that over serving can be a problem and needs to be monitored, which can be hard when people move from bar to bar and there is no way to know how much someone has had to drink. But their behavior towards us was so hostile, I felt unwelcome and bullied.

During this time, all the girls in my group used the single stall bathroom right next to the host stand. When I went in, I made sure to lock the door, yet people walked in on 3 different occasions less than 2 minutes apart. First of all, a restaurant shouldn't make a single stall bathroom available if a lock doesn't work because that could lead to a potentially dangerous situation. Secondly, the three associates at the host stand were too wrapped up in their own conversation to notice despite the door being less than 3 feet away from them... Or maybe they noticed and just didn't care. Either or, the hosts should not engage in such unprofessional behavior.\\n\\nAfter that debacle, my friends and I were finally seated.

It could be that I am just used to the heavy salty flavors of tonkotsu ramen from other places and don't appreciate the subtle flavors at Santouka.

The Ramen was mediocre and would satisfy a ramen craving, but not one where I would drive out of my way for. The salmon cilantro sashimi is overpowered by the soy in the citrus soy sauce that you mainly taste the soy, but the diced jalape√±os and cilantro toppings made it more refreshing to help balance it.

It was a wonderful experience and they did a fantastic job.\\n\\nFirst off, they handled our large group incredibly well. There were 20 of us total and we were in a private room downstairs. We only had one server actually attending to us (multiple to serve the food. We all got our food at the same time!) and she did a fantastic job. I cannot thank her enough.

She took the time to explain the menu to everyone at the beginning of the meal and got everyone's orders correct. It was crazy impressive.\\n\\nI wish I could say more about the food but as a picky eater, this wasn't my type of joint. I went because it was an important dinner but I didn't each much. However, those who enjoyed Peruvian food RAVED about it. There were absolutely no leftovers of any of the family style dishes. Our first course was three parts. A potato dish, ceviche and a salad. Everyone loved it and we got seconds because it was all gone so fast! Our second course was individual and we had the choice of I think four dishes? I got the filet mignon with asparagus and a tamale. It was a decent meal. Wasn't the best but again I'm a picky eater so what do I know? Everyone else was raving about it so I'm gonna assume I'm in the wrong and I am perfectly okay with that. Our last course was dessert served family style again. We got these cute little caramel-lime wafer cookies and some cake square. I didn't try the cookies but everyone liked them. The chocolate cake was very dense and bitter-sweet but tasty. Then we were served coffee and tea! \\n\\nIt was a wonderful evening. I am amazed at how well our server handled everything. From never letting drink glasses go empty to the pacing to remembering everyone's dishes to her patience, she did an amazing job.\\n\\nI will say if we were in the main room, I'm not sure how enjoyable it would have been.

Wow, it was too salty - a common theme I found in in the dishes we tried. The calamari itself didn't seem like fresh squid, but something that was pre-cooked. I didn't like the breading they used for the calamari either. I did enjoy the little fried gherkins. It was the largest portion out of all the appetizers we ordered so I happily shared with the table. My friends all got the coconut shrimp, which I liked the best, but only 3 pieces. Gyoza was not memorable either. \\n\\nSecond Course, I ordered the Lobster fried rice. I was excited, because the presentation looked so cool and pretty with the fried lobster tail placed on top of the rice. It was good, but again too salty! The portion size was good and lots of good lobster chunks. My friends got the fried chicken and lobster mac and cheese. Nothing fusion about this dish lol, but the chicken was actually very tender and juicy. My sister got the crispy beef...was not a fan of this and it was inconsistent with another crispy dish we had at our table. \\n\\nMy dessert was a strawberry cake.

Surely, you would think that to avoid this problem, one should always make a reservation. Yes, that is sound logic. In fact, that is what my party did prior to our last two visits. However, at Andina, your reservation time is meaningless. We had a reservation for 7:30 pm - we arrived and were told we would have to wait 5-10 minutes for a table. Ok, reasonable. 20 minutes go by, we are told again, 5-10 minutes. At this point, nearly 8 pm, the hostess suggests we have a drink at the bar. Ok, fine. We go to the bar and the bar hostess tells us we cannot have a drink at the bar because we don't have a seat and we cannot stand around the bar either. Hm. At 8:15 pm we check again with the hostess to which - surprise, surprise - they say 5-10 minutes. At this point, we are standing against a wall with a bunch of other waiting parties and I pretty much let it fly. I demanded to know what the point of a reservation is if I'm going to have to wait 45 minutes whilst continually being led on in infuriatingly 5-10 minute increments. The hostess and the manager at this point replied - \\"Well there are other people with reservations ahead of you.\\" Oh. So you're disappointing several of your customers. Ok. Somehow that is supposed to appease us or ameliorate the slight? Not okay. In fact, after the manager said that, two nearby parties left because they thought everyone else who was waiting didn't have a reservation. The manager kept saying we cannot predict \\"campers.\\" Except here is why you can. The fact that you have a term for it implies that this happens frequently. Both times we have visited the restaurant this has happened. We are not the only ones continually frustrated. Here's a solution. Call your customers with reservations ahead of time and let them know you're running behind. A reservation is a pseudo-contract, of sorts. It sets an expectation. Otherwise, what is the point?! Yes, your food is great and I suppose that's why people put up with this practice. However, there are strategies management can put in place to help avoid these very frustrating scenarios. It's not just about waiting - it's about expectations and everything else, like childcare, that gets disturbed when people try to plan an evening and do everything in their control to execute it smoothly.

The menu has so many items to select from. The prices are very fair and the portions are generous. I have eaten many of the pasta entrees.

My boyfriend says that he 's usually  weary of asian fusion restaurants and usually rightfully so but Poor Calvin's got it sooo riiiight!  We made a reservation for 8:15 on opentable on a Sunday. Restaurant wasn't pack but we had to wait about 15 mins because it looked like they were only seating diners upstairs and clearing out the downstairs area by bar. The bartender offered to take drink orders for us while we waited. The cocktail I got was  called \\"el Diablo- ginger beer, tequila, cassis liqueur. The lychee sangria was ok, not how I like sangria, it was  more on the juice tasting end instead of being wine or liquor forward. \\n\\nI'm glad we were seated up stairs because the decor at night with the Buddha and lighted  cherry blossom tree  created a nice ambience (see pics). There was a large table seated across from us so restaurant can accommodate large groups.  The website says that the cocktail and food menu changes seasonally. \\n\\nFor appetizer we tried the lobster Wontons  with caviar on the top (14 dollars). Reminded me of crab Rangoon app, but much more elevated of course. At first I was not too thrilled when I saw caviar as an ingredient because I've never had caviar but I always imagined it to just be very fishy tasting. It was not too bad. More so a pop of saltiness. Not the freshest my boyfriend commented only because there was a hint of fishiness and he has very high standards for that. He says if it taste like fish it's not fresh enough. But here I'd agree. If you like caviar, these will blow your mind. Overall 4 stars. \\n\\nEntrees are huge portions, so that's why we didn't get more than one app .The sea bass in  red curry sauce  (37 dollars) with Korean yam mash and quail egg on top was so good 5/5. It was so good that to this day almost a month later I'm still thinking about it and reminiscing of the taste. I've been trying to do some research on finding a recipe that I could use to mimic the dish but I'm sure won't come close. The fish was very fresh. The curry coconut sauce soaked up in the fish was so tasty. I could have just eaten that curry sauce alone. The Peruvian pepper  with olives was a nice little sweet spicy flavor that complimented the dish well.  I went back recently to check out menu and I didn't see this version of the sea bass on menu but another sea bass entree. What a shame if you missed this!\\n\\nWe also had the sweet beef dish (25 dollars). Very good! 4.5 stars. Sweet n  crispy beef. Good huge portion of quality tender beef.

They give you a lot too and it reheats incredibly well. \\n\\nAfterwards, we had their spin on a caramel apple  for desert. This was probably my favorite of the night. It was essentially a chocolate turtle apple; an apple covered in milk chocolate with rich caramel drizzle and pecan pieces, cut into slices.

Chickpeas are insanely cheap. Even organic chickpeas are cheap. You don't need to let them roam and pretend to love them before you kill them off. $9 for a chickpea sandwich without fries is really bad. It's essentially a falafel on a burger bun for $9. I was really hoping it'd be something special that would differentiate it from a mediocre falafel. But, it really didn't. It was standard, and the bun complimented the chickpeas less than the pita. In the future i'd definitely order it \\"on the grass\\" as they say.

We waited 40 minutes for a table (it was lunchtime on a weekend) which we were all fine with since we're from Fort Worth where we regularly eat at an all vegan restaurant called Spiral Diner. We were seated and quickly ordered our food. It took about 30 minutes for the food to come out, but once it did I was more than okay with the wait. I got The Renedict which is a vegan take on eggs benedict, with tofu scramble, and vegan hollandaise sauce. \\nThe food there is pretty tasty, I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in town again."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"1600 Providence Hwy","city":"Norwood","stars":"1.5","text":"Waited nicely 23 minutes fries were not crisp and shown as cooked lady  came in drive asking for hotter fries (why blame her) hate come Fries she sat to talk to friend or employee off duty love to take picture she played milkshake for minutes to fix the machine pathetic don't go to Foxboro route 1 south bc its dirty always Norwood isn't good I guess needs to improve I\\nWill go to downtown Norwood in for now  ok but 14 minutes longer for me"},{"name":"Happy House","address":"4234 N Interstate Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It was amazing food, Love the waitress she was a hoot.

Solid place it seemed. The reservation on open table was seamless.\\nSaturday night came and we were fortunate to find parking outside of the cluster that was the area they are in. What a cluster it was. Valet only parking, in a very popular area to hangout, we witnessed the valet people running headless cramming cars into any nook possible; it seemed like a car shipping port. Next, we had a hard time finding the place because there was no signage whatsoever, and once we walked in far enough, saw the entrance below a terrace or something. Hard to tell. Outside there was a sea of people waiting for their cars. Poor suckers; they would be waiting for a long time in that mess. \\nThe entrance was narrow and full of waiting people. Bad design and layout. Next up was the men's bathroom straight out of a dive bar, and not a \\"hip\\" one, as in one urinal, one wash basin, tiny, and wet with pee and water. For a fancy establishment, this bathroom is unacceptable. The whole place smelled of smoke and roasted chicken, and of course we left with clothes and hair smelling of it. You will see why the layout is so cramped: there's a sea of tables. They maximized seating area.\\nFor the establishment experience, i give them a one star. They should hire a entertainment consultant to redo the experience from parking to finish. It's just awful.\\nAs for the food, it was good food. We ordered the oysters as appetizers, the brisket and steak as entree. All three were very good and the portions generous. Great flavor and texture. They gifted us a brownie with ice cream for our anniversary, which was a nice touch. The wife and I both enjoyed the food in our cramped seating area, practically touching the next table's elbows. Of course, we could hear their conversation, and they complained about the space and smell as well.\\nFor the food and service, I give them four stars.\\nIt's a shame this place is so inconvenient and uncomfortable to go to, if you are not a beltline resident.\\nhard to recommend."},{"name":"The Berry Tavern","address":"2 High St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3","text":"The steak tips and the truffle fries are my favorite!

I ordered the tantan ramen and it did not disappoint. The richness of the broth, spicy garlic oil, and sesame seeds were the right combination to slurp. The noodles had the perfect chew to them, the ground pork had a nice flavor, and the sliced pork was the best ramen pork that I've ever had with soup. The only downfall was that I couldn't finish all of my broth because it was so filling.

Always a great experience. \\n\\nFirst of all- the ambiance.  Rheinlander is divided into many rooms. They have many private rooms that seat about 6-10, as well as multiple hall rooms. The waitress also said they have a larger banquet area that seats about 100.  Its great to reserve a private room for your family, or special function.\\n\\nThey've got a wandering accordion player throughout the evening. Occasionally, several of the staff will belt out good old fashion German tunes with him on the squeezebox. Its a pretty good show and everyone gets involved.\\n\\nNow- the food. BEST German food in Portland. They get special mention for their fondue. You can get it with cubed bread, sausages or soft, warm pretzels. This is so good. I can't go here without ordering it.  The Lentil Soup is another staple I usually order.\\n\\nI've almost always ordered one of the many Shnitzles here. These are to die for. My favorite, however, is the Jaegershnitzle. This is veal (or chicken) served with a nice paprika mushroom sauce. But you really can't go wrong with any of the shnitzles.\\n\\nAnother awesome choice for food is one of the multiple \\"Feasts\\". You have to have at least two people to order, and bring you lots of different kinds of food, served family style. This is a really good way to go.\\n\\n*The food is a sometimes a little too salty, but still delicious. Also- almost everything here is very rich, so prepare for a \\"Food Coma\\" afterwards. \\n\\nI don't know if that whole \\"wait an hour before swimming\\" is true. But you aren't going to be swimming or playing tennis or anything else active for awhile after tucking away a meal here. Portions are very good sized. \\n\\nThe staff is super friendly and very accommodating. \\n\\nI will enjoy eating here again and again."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"fancy. special occasion worthy. delicious tapas - traditional and spin-off. great service. pricy.\\n\\nyou won't be disappointed with andina, thats for sure. but this isnt a place i would go 'just for a meal.' you will see a lot of birthday celebrations here, etc. but definitely worth a visit for some delectable foodie cuisine and to say you are experienced it :)\\n\\nmy favorite item by fav was their traditional ceviche:\\n\\n*cebiche\\nDE PESCADO \\"5 ELEMENTOS\\" *\\nour iconic preparation of fresh fish in leche de tigre\\n\\ngoodness...it was just outstanding. i would have opted to get a large of that and skip one of the other items selected. such fresh fish, amazing flavor.\\n\\n*SOLTERITO\\nYukon Gold potato with a salad of green beans, fresh corn, cotija cheese and tomatoes\\n\\nbeautiful presentation, chilled, and quite refreshing\\n\\n*ANTICUCHO DE PULPO\\ngrilled octopus kebobs with chimichurri and a caper majado de papa\\n\\ni just love octopus now :) giant tentacles, well-cooked and rich in flavor. beautiful as well.\\n\\n*MUSCIAME DE AT√öN\\nthinly-sliced cured tuna loin with chimichurri and an avocado-tomato majado\\n\\nsigh...i will admit this was massively my fault as i didnt really know what we order. tuna jerky. high ocean flavor. major pass for me. there were soooo many other items on the menu and as a girl who loves tuna sashimi, this was just a let down. me no like tuna jerky. if you do, by all means!\\n\\nour server was an absolute doll.
