I came here for Sunday brunch and I have to say it was the best brunch I have ever had. I came here with two other people on Sunday around 10:45. I am glad we got there as early as we did. They don't take reservations and call aheads. They said the wait would be about an hour but we only waited 35 minutes. There are places to sit and water to drink while you wait which is nice. (My other friend went the same day and only waited 40 min out of the expected hour as well.) The service was great for as many people that were there. Our waited never let our waters and coffee get less than half full. It's buffet style so other than the check, which came quickly after we were done, we didn't see our waiter often. The brunch butter was incredible, especially for the price we paid. It was $17.50 a person I believe. As compared to say the Omni Hotel brunch on Sunday, which is $30 a person, this place was so much better, especially for what you pay. They had a huge variety of both breakfast, lunch and dessert items. My favorites were the Migas, cornflake crusted chicken tenders, and the broccoli rice casserole. And then there was the French toast, which I had to go back for seconds for. The atmosphere was an A+. There are so many rooms to Moonshine, each having a different vibe but all so fun. We sat in the outside area with the plastic curtains down to keep us warm. It was nice to feel outside and see the sunshine without having to deal with the wind.

I had heard it was good.I heard it was good here on Yelp.  I also heard it was good from my mom, who ended up being taken here by a hoyty-toyty neighbor of hers for some now forgotten reason.  If my mom didn't like Italian food somewhere, she would definitely mutter something under her breath or sort of make a face.  If she liked it, she would remain silent.  She remained silent about Piazza Italia.I finally ended up at Piazza Italia because some college friends from \\"down under\\" (by one state, that is) had come up to see their relatives and made some time to get together with me.  They were treating and wanted to know of a place.  I looked at the prices for A Cena and thought that would be pushing it.  The prices at Piazza Italia looked more appropriate for them picking up the tab for a party of 3.The food was very good.  The bread was just right.  The pastas were excellent - there were 2 orders of lasagna and 1 order of \\"Gino's favorite,\\" a linguini with egg and meat. I had one of the lasagnas.  The flavor landed at a great midpoint between rich and subtle, and the consistency was among the best I've had upon ordering lasagna.  (Surprisingly, a friend from Las Vegas stumbled upon a diner in Sin City which had a lasagna for a pittance, which I then dreamed about, and is now closed).   I was a little underwhelmed by the dessert.  We didn't order tiramisu or the typical staples at Italian restaurants, but instead ordered goblets of gelato.  Two were lemon flavored and one was a flavor called Bounty.  We tasted each others' gelatos.  It was 3.5-ish in the dessert category.Being the Pearl and resembling an Italian restaurant in downtown Seattle at the base of a condo tower where I did not like the service, I was expecting it to be two peas in a pod.  In short, I expected the service to be a little on the cavalier side.  It was not like that.  The service was informal, affable, and expedient.  The only complaint I might have is that, as is the case with many restaurants, they all rattle off their specials so quickly that you need to ask again.Then, it must pass the litmus test with real Italians, as opposed to fake ones.  The tables on both sides of our table were occupied by natives of Italy.  That's a good sign.As far as the logistics go, you should not attempt to go to Piazza Italia without a reservation.  The other thing is that it is so far up in the Pearl, and almost at the Fremont Bridge, that street parking might be found.  Such was the case with us. Also, I was trying to figure out how the name Piazza Italia came to be.  While not exactly a piazza in an Italianate sense, there is a park-like public space about one block to the east.  I wonder if THAT is the piazza.Piazza Italia fell a tad short of Tre Marie in Montreal, and I mean just a tad, so it gets a strong 4 stars from me."},{"name":"Arleta Library Bakery Cafe","address":"5513 SE 72nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This tiny brunch spot is everything you think and more.

We got the last orders of biscuits and gravy, and that panacotta French toast. I got the Portlander which is a delicious scramble of eggs, bacon, mushrooms, onion, and cheese.

When I say I want to explore a city, I mean I want to eat my way through it. I had heard about Pok Pok from a youtube video I had seen. I put it on my list of must go to restaurants. \\nOnce we arrived they took my cell phone number and said they would text me when a seat opens up. The street that PokPok is on is a charming little street with all kinds of little shops. We took a walk down the street and charted out where were wanted to go for desert after lunch. Finally, we got a text after about 20 minutes. We were quickly seated and enjoyed the outdoor like vibe they had inside the restaurant. I felt like I was in another country. The restaurant was set up in a way that didn't look like the U.S. I loved it! It made me feel like I was somewhere very new and beyond our borders.  \\nI asked the waitress what she recommended. She said the ikes fish sauce wings were the most popular. Half dozen fresh whole natural chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Vietnamese fish sauce and garlic and served with Cu Cai (pickled vegetables). They made it in spicy and non spicy. I ordered two orders of the wings, both spicy and unspicy. She also said Khao Soi Neua the muslim style beef curry is good. It was a Mild Muslim style beef curry noodle soup made with complex dry spice mixture and topped with coconut cream.  Served with house pickled mustard greens, shallots, crispy yellow noodles and roasted chili paste.  We ordered that as well with jasmine rice on the side. \\nOne thing we found odd was that they gave us a tiny dish of complimentary peanuts.  It was about the size of what a 1 year old would eat. I asked her if she could give us a bigger bowl since there is 5 of us. She said it would cost us $5 to get a bigger bowl. I told her I'd pay for it. I did think it was a little weird they were charging us extra for getting more of a complimentary item. FOOD:\\nI was so excited to to try Ikes fish sauce wings. I am usually disapointed with what I get when Im hyped up about a something. I was not disapointed. I would bite into my chicken wing and also take a bite of jasmine rice and it was the MOST PERFECT bite of food imaginable. A bit sticky, crispy, juicy.  It was like all my senses were on high alert. Im not a huge fan of fish sauce but I liked these wings. It is a bit strong on the fish sauce flavor so that is the reason I took a bite of the rice with it but the combination just blew my mind. It was out of this world! I loved every bite. I would give it 5 out of 5 stars for sure! The the muslim style beef curry was good. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be but my husband loved it more than I did which would tell me that it depends on who is eating it. He ate every last bit of it. It was different and had a multitude of flavors orchestrated into one delicious bowl. I would give it a 4 out of 5 if I was rating this alone. Service:\\nService was wonderful. Our waitress was very informative and was able to answer any questions we had. She would describe the food in such detail and I loved that. She was also very quick to get drinks to our table. That is always something that I pay attention to. I give service a 5/5 stars. All in all this is a great experience. I truly recommend this place. If not for the the amazing food...the amazing atmosphere of this place."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is my go to best restaurant.

Despite being 8:30 on a Sunday morning, FitS was quite full, and by the time we left half an hour later, there was a line about twenty people deep -- no doubt a testament to the reputation of the original. Seating is a bit more sparse than the other location, but there's definitely *room* for more, so perhaps that will be rectified soon.I ordered a mocha, my girlfriend ordered a latte, and the two of us split a pecan sticky bun and a cinnamon roll. The pastries behind the counter look beautiful and delicious, so it was hard to pick just two...but we couldn't have been happier with our choices. The pecan sticky bun was very rich, but not overbearingly so, and had the perfect balance of caramel sweetness and the soft and satisfying mouthfeel of dough. For my money, however, the real star of the show was the cinnamon roll. The roll itself was soft, sweet, and delicious, but man oh man...the cream cheese icing. Wow. Most cream cheese icing is good, but *this* icing is on another level entirely. When unicorns dream, this is what they dream of. It's soft, fluffy, not overly sweet, and just plain perfect. The drinks could have been horrible and I would STILL give this location a five-star review for that cinnamon roll alone.Fortunately, the drinks were both excellent as well. I didn't try my girlfriend's latte, but she assured me that it was very good. My mocha was also delicious -- I'd had one at the original location, and this tasted about the same (which is a good thing). It's worth mentioning, however, that you can really taste the cocoa in a FitS mocha...something you can't say about most other coffee shops. I mean *real* cocoa, not just syrup or mixes. The overall price for two specialty drinks and two large, delicious pastries was $17, which is more than reasonable given the high quality of the product. There's really nothing negative I can say about this new location of Fox in the Snow. So long as they get a bit more seating to accommodate the inevitable hordes who will frequent their shop, they will surely rival Stauf's as the best coffee house in German Village."},{"name":"Hey Love","address":"920 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Came in for a drink during happy hour and the services was good and friendly.

I am so excited that they have gua bao Ââ≤ÂåÖ, jelly meat pie ËÇâÂúì, pig blood cake Ë±¨Ë°ÄÔøΩ? oyster pancake Ëöµ‰ªîÔøΩ? Taiwanese vermicelli È∫µÁ∑ö, pork ball (Ë≤¢‰∏∏), pork rice È≠ØËÇâÔøΩ?  various meats simmered in soy sauce ÈπµÊ∞¥: tofu, pig ear, intestine...  and all the other Taiwanese dishes that I can't find in restaurants in S. Florida.  My favorite is hands down the gua bao, an open faced bun filled with a slice of melt-in-your-mouth braised pork belly, along with some cilantro, peanuts and pickled green.  Yup, sweet and savory, soft and crunchy... it nails it all. If you want a little spice, ask for their hot sauce - it's just mildly spicy with a hint of sweetness, and goes really good with the bun. Do not think the pork belly bun is an invention of some New York fusion chef, it's a traditional Taiwanese snack that goes way back. They have beef noodles too, another well known Taiwanese dish.  While the beef and tendons are tender, the noodles and soup are just so-so.  The popcorn chicken is crispy on the outside, spicy with the chili powder, but moist inside.  We also tried the savory soy milk, which comes with fried cruller, scallion and dried shrimp.  Somehow the texture comes out rather custardy, more like tofu pudding than soy milk.  While some are the dishes are a miss, we enjoyed most everything we ordered.  They have many bento boxes available, at an affordable price of around $8, with options like fried pork chop, basil chicken, etc.  Do check their menu board behind the counter, where they list the daily specials.  Which does change daily: soup, dumplings, vermicelli, fried pork chop, and many other.  Also note that they close rather early at night, so if you plan on dinner, make it early bird."},{"name":"Maple Street Biscuit Company - Oviedo","address":"978 City Plaza Way","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"First time here at Maple Street.

Me and one other friend arrived here first at 10:30 and told the hostess that we'd need a table for five. She asked if everyone in the party was already there and I told her no, so she said that she couldn't seat us until everyone arrived. Cool, I said. So me and my friend just chilled out on the patio sitting in one of the few rocking chairs that they have out on the patio.  As we were sitting there, enjoying the weather and exchanging conversations, I grew concerned because the place was getting packed. People kept coming and more people kept waiting out on the patio.So fast forward about 30 minutes later when my friends eventually showed up, we went back to the hostess and we were given one of those pager thingies. \\"Noooooo!!!\\" I yelled out loud silently in my head. But after I sat back down to wait, my pager buzzed. Not even 1 minute after they gave it to me!

The rest was just spring greens with some spinach mixed in. For a non-protein containing salad, one would expect more.  Don't. The $3.00 cookie I had was very dry and my colleague's spiced chai was 50% foam.  **Update-12/2/13- Went in again, due to the lousy weather and it's close... they now do offer a protein (chicken) for the to-go salads, but you have to ask for it... and dish out an additional $4.00... so a small salad with chicken costs you  $13** Staff seems friendly, but don't really seem to all be on the same page as to who is doing what.

Ignoring all that, and I still have nothing positive to say. I got a burger. How do you slap a burger together so poorly?

Everyone who works there is about as friendly and outgoing as can be, and they are always ready and willing to help. \\nThe food is absolutely amazing. They clearly pride themselves on a high quality of food, which us patrons greatly appreciate. Their commitment to good food is so strong, that they actually get their cookies delivered all the way from New York, even though there are closer and cheaper alternatives. They are that committed to having the best quality foods in their restaurant, and it shows, in every bite you take!\\nI love the fact that between the display case / carryout counter and the 2 dinning sections, they have figured out a way of accommodating both \\"quick and cheap in-and-out  lunch visits\\" as well as \\"Fine dining eat in visits\\". \\nBeyond all that, they are also very engaging in the community! My daughter was selling girl scout cookies, and she took them into their restaurant. Not only did they welcome her in without hesitation, but in the end, almost everyone who was on shift that day, ended up buying cookies from her, and they all thanked her for coming, even though, they just did her the favor!!!

Some people complain that it's too salty, like the hubs, but I like it.  The saltiness pairs well with the pickled veggies that comes with the wings or some sticky rice.  The wings can be made spicy, which is what we asked for.  It wasn't spicy.  Papaya Pok Pok salad was light and refreshing.  I wish we had the chance to try more dishes but it's hard work food hopping from place to place.  Biggest gripe about our visit was the seating.

Exactly my thoughts when I asked a friend what else we could do on a 4-day visit. I added it to our itinerary anyway as a filler for in between meals but not necessarily a priority. Well, let me tell you how mistaken I was to underestimate Powell's City of Books. We drove around downtown one evening and when I spotted the entire block that housed the largest bookstore in the world, my jaw dropped; I was in awe. Eyes wide, head turning in various directions, and smiling from ear to ear while enjoying the aroma of used books in the air, I was like a kid in a candy store. They sell both new and old books here and carry just about anything you could imagine. I was overwhelmed with the selections on each floor and after a few minutes of browsing the recommended books of the month, something finally caught my eye. I didn't put that book down until I was done, cover to cover. I walked around the store reading it, stood in between shelves, rode the lift up different floors, found a nook with a bench to read, and walked down flights of stairs to the 1st floor as I finished the book when they were just about to close for the night. The store itself has that warehouse look making any Barnes and Noble look very elegant. And that's exactly the charm that made me love this place so much.

Killer Burger won hands down for Ron and I.  We decided 2017 was the search for the best Mexican food in Portland year.  A noble calling, right?  Well, yes it was until Ron had pre-stroke symptoms and had the big wake-up call: eat right or die.  Mexican food, sad sigh, is not usually prescribed for this condition.  Ron has taken this deadly (I know, sick) seriously and is thriving.  I'm sometimes not as steadfast, so Don Pedro's is right within steps of both the bus and train.  My feet just beat a path to their door twice in two weeks because I hadn't had Mexican food for six months.The parking lot is large and roomy, and there are sidewalks placed conveniently all around (this restaurant is near the junction of Stark and Burnside and also near the Gresham MAX train stop).  There is also a drive-through lane for ordering and takeout.I decided to order in and eat in the restaurant.  The very busy and very friendly staff were on top of everything (these young people hustle I can tell you).  I ordered a wet carnitas asada burrito the first time and a dry carnitas asada burrito at the second visit.  I did not like the sauce at the first visit nor the meat at the first or second visit.  At the first visit, the sauce resembled the bright red sauce on Chinese sweet-and-sour dishes and was sweetish and spicier.  The carnitas asada was way overcooked and nearly had the consistency of small marbles.  Putting some salsa and pico de gallo from the salsa bar did help.I would come again to eat here while remembering to choose chicken as my protein and only order dishes without sauce.  I think it would work better for me.

I loved the concept and the kids had fun making the pancakes and being creative.  The menu had some really creative food items on it.

The bartender said they were out of that bourbon. Seriously?! You're a full bar and ran out at two o'clock in the afternoon when you are open until 2AM?! So he settled for Woodford Rye Manhattan, not as good. A few minutes later after we got our cocktails, someone stocked the shelf with Woodford Reserve Bourbon. Thanks, lazy bartender!

The veggies were the most \\"traditional\\" thing we chose, with something like oyster sauce in the mix.  The ribs were delicious, but as is the case with short ribs, were a bit hard to eat.  The accompanying sauces were excellent though, and gave it a great kick.  The bartender also wisely suggested the sticky rice, which was an excellent complement.  I'm not one to eat with my hands, but once I gave in I was a happy camper.The dungeness crab comes pre-cracked, but even with that being the case it was an incredibly \\"hands on\\" experience.  You had to earn every bite, and the egg-based mush it was sitting on didn't look appealing at all.  Tasted good, but it looked far too similar going in to how it did coming out.

The chicken karaage we ordered was well fried but also....in need of salt or seasoning. The greens they put in the bowl are absolutely filler. There's no seasoning to them.

You've got at least 4 or 5 pools all of which are connected by a lazy river. I'm bald headed, so the following comment is really important to me....the river is almost completely covered in \\"jungle canopy\\". Very well shaded and the river actually moves at a good clip. Hop on your tubes and enjoy the ride. During peak seasons, like when we visited, they serve drinks to people in the river from the side. Some of the pools are for sports, one for babies, one quite and etc. Additionally, the group activities for kids was OUTSTANDING! We had a smore campfire, coloring activities poolside, lemonaides and frozen juices during the hot of the day. They did a bang up job and you didn't have to pay for every kids activity...some that included you walking away with a physical object like a painted coconut or something.We were there for Memorial Day and had no clue they did a special celebration in conjunction with the Ritz.

I'd be totally fine if this is the only thing I ever eat again when I go again (but I'll try something new next time)! Part of me totally wishes I worked or lived downtown, just so I could come here more often. However, my FAVORITE thing about True Food Kitchen, more than the service, the food, and the drinks... The actual restaurant. I loved how open it was. For a downtown location, I was very surprised how BIG this place is. And I LOVED the open kitchen feel. I love to cook, and I loved that I could see the chefs at work, and some of the wines and fruits / veggies out. Our table was right next to the kitchen. The interior design was spot on.

Seated immediately, server did not come to the table for 12 minutes.  We placed our order, and food arrived in about 20 minutes.  It took 15 minutes to bring a pot of tea.  We ordered rice noodles, as we did on the first visit, and oddly, the serving size was noticeably smaller.  We didn't inquire about this, but found it rather odd.  We also ordered the crab Rangoon, which were rather bland, and wrapped in a tough, thick pasta dough... not something we would order again.  Also, ordered were the steamed shumai dumplings, which were well-seasoned and acceptable.  Our last dish was the lemon chicken, which was a flattened, single, deep-fried chicken breast, coated with what appears to be panko crumbs, with a lemon-honey sauce on the side.  The chicken was dry and tasteless, but the sauce helped.  All food presentation was attractive.  The worst part of the experience came with receiving the check.  It took more than 20 minutes to get the check and pay our bill.  The server said they were \\"changing shifts,\\" which accounted for the wait.

Plus we got free churros with goat milk dulce de leche for free when I checked-in on Yelp! Loved the chips and guac! The chips were crunchy but not too hard that would scrape your gums and the guac tasted really good too. My order was the fish taco, it was a good sized cod fish fillet and it came with salsa, sauce and cilantro. I enjoyed the freshness of the flavours together with the battered cod. Hubby got the steak and the chipotle chicken. He enjoyed the steak a lot while the chicken was good. He said that he liked that it was simple, not too much frills but done really well. The free churros arrived freshly made and the goat milk dulce de leche was lovely (and I'm not a huge fan of goat's milk or cheese).Service was great as they were very friendly and prompt.

Second course we had codfish (actually pretty decent, the fish was very flaky and tender with good balanced flavors) and the bavette steak (totally disappointed by, I literally make steak better than this). The dessert was decent but the bartender AGAIN screwed up our order. We ordered the brioche beignet and the matcha panna cotta but he brought us the dulcey ganache instead of the beignet. The matcha panna cotta was an interesting flavor, but plated well and I did enjoy it. The ganache was average.Won't be coming back here again and wouldn't recommend this restaurant.

It is more filling than you'd think. We go on Date Night sometimes as well. There is even a Happy Hour. You need to order a beverage at that time. I recommend a Green Iced Tea, which they will gladly make for you. It's just right for a filling meal of Sushi. The building is an old one, and it's in a great location.

You can also make a day of it, and just ride the MAX or Bus around for a while. You should totally do this as a special occasion day, or night sometime. :) And you can use your card, as well.

The very fact that it was a bookstore that took up an entire city block fascinated me. The technical bookstore, a couple blocks away, always made me feel the same way. There was something amazing about walking into a store the size of yours and seeing the sheer number of books, bigger than any library I had been to. The smell of old paper and literacy was everywhere and almost overpowering.In spite of my fondness for your store as a child, I've decided to move on with my life. No longer will I be perusing the aisles and shelves of your store. Mr. Powell, if you're reading this, here are your reasons why:1. The markup. Everyone knows that Powell's has an insane markup on their books. It's the primary reason that they give you so much more money when you sell books to them /provided you get a gift card/. I certainly understand why small businesses have to mark things up so high, but you're not a small business anymore -- you're a juggernaut. Your store takes up an entire city block. If I want high prices from a large bookstore, I'll go to Borders or Barnes & Noble. They have cafes too, now. Just like your store.2. The Book Buyers. My experience with the used book buyers has always been nothing short of curt and unhelpful. Most recently, I phoned in with a list of books I wanted to sell, including four copies of the same book. They told me they would purchase at least two copies of the aforementioned tome. When I arrived less than two hours later, I was turned away with all four copies, the buyers having purchased nothing. Thanks for the wasted trip, guys. You could have at least paid for the $1.60 in parking I had to pay to have the privilege of hauling four heavy books into your store and waiting in line before being asked to return them to my car.3. Customer service in general. I know you're probably trying to get a cross-section of Portland culture with your employees, but they could do without the pretension and snobbery. Not everyone in town is an Emo hipster type who'd just as soon spit on you as look at you. You're the world's largest independent bookstore. Congrats. Help me find the book I'm looking for. No, I don't care about your skinny jeans and tattoos. After numerous sub-par experiences, I've decided that I'm going elsewhere. Powell's was an incredible experience when I was a child, but it's a mess now -- it's impossible to find parking, the prices are high, and the staff is rude. And I'm frankly scared to use the bathrooms after seeing them in disarray on a number of occasions.I'm giving you two stars in the hopes that you turn it around. Powell's is a Portland landmark, but it's getting to the point that it's really only a place where tourists should shop so they can say they bought something there. Yeah, there's all that garbage about \\"shop local, *ever changing percentage* of your dollar go right back into the local economy,\\" but I can usually save that same amount by shopping Amazon and get the same service there. Lower your prices, reign in your staff, and get them to give me accurate information. I'll probably be back if you do -- hell, you were a part of my childhood. When that happens, give me a call. Sadly,Me"},{"name":"Soto South Lamar","address":"1100 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 2115","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My sushi heart falls to Soto!

I moved away from Boston 2 years ago and this is still the food establishment I miss the most.Most authentic Thai/Vietnamese fusion food you can get. I've tried several Thai dishes here but the Pad Thai is still my favorite. It's because they make it \\"Country Style\\" which has that rich Tamarind sauce with the bright orange color. Most other places have the light bland flavor where most of the noodles are still sad and boringly (yes, I just made up a word, thanks) white colored. I get mines with Chicken or Pork. Complement it with the homemade fried chili oil condiment that's as addictive as crack and you have an amazing taste of Thailand.Always go for the lunch special because it's the same portion as dinner for a cheaper price. Add a couple of bucks and you get the appetizer and soup combo which had the most aromatic bowl of broth I've ever had. It tastes similar to Pho broth but way more aromatic like star anise sucker-punched the broth.

It sounds safe and basic, but boy does it blow other restaurant's flavor out of the water! Order it with whatever protein you want (tofu, chicken, beef).  Sometimes they have specials where they would make it with snapper or shrimp.  Drunken noodles is also a great option where they replace the rice with noodles. The curries are great here too.  The flavors are deep and not watered down. Panang curry is what I typically order at Thai restos and theirs is excellent.  Another favorite is Praram.  It is a stir fry that uses peanut butter in the sauce and it is delicious!  It has similar flavors to the peanut butter dipping sauce in Thai dishes.  I love mine with tofu.The restaurant is in a somewhat removed building away from the rest of the stripmall.  I've seen the building change from a diner, to a cuban spot, to an arepa spot... but now that Mee Thai has taken over, it's definitely gonna be there to stay! It has some of the best Thai food in Orlando and guess what... it made it on the Top Yelp 100 2019!"},{"name":"Casa Alvarez","address":"3161 Walnut St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"This place has some of the best non healthy Mexican food anywhere.

Food didn't take too long to come out which Is definitely a plus. I ordered the spicy version and it was pretty darn good! It isn't as fishy (at all) as the authentic fish sauce wings but the flavor works very well for any person questioning how fish sauce might taste. If you're looking for a unique style of wings, definitely check this place out.

We have wayyyy too many local breweries for a place like this to not have taps. They only offer can and bottle beer. The moonshine drinks they do offer are pretty darn strong and hit or miss taste-wise. I would recommend the hard lemonade, but instead of Titos have them use the strawberry moonshine. Very good! The margarita and regular hard lemonade were good too. \\nThe most amazing part of dinner was the dessert....the skillet apple pie. OMG, this is a must have!!

Possibly the worst staff at a restaurant I have ever experienced EVER! It's my own fault actually because I came here and gave a second try after already having a bad experience a few weeks back. When I originally came here I was just with my son who is almost 2 we were shopping and I decided it would be fun to go eat just us. First of all when I walked in the door the hostess was so RUDE she did not greet me and basically waited about 3 minutes of looking me up and down and said how many. Then told me to wait, I waited probably 7 minutes at the front after seeing plenty of tables available. Now they go to sit me at a 4 chair table with my son didn't offer a high chair or anything again he's only almost 2. I had to ask for a booth and then wait again although there were some available and then ask for a booster seat. They did not offer my son crayons or anything like that even though we saw other kids with balloons he was not offered one of those either. This time around my waitress was actually ok but the food not I got the chicken sandwich the bread was so stale and got my son a grilled cheese that was burnt to a crisp. I left a review on the device on the table after and that was that. That wasn't even the bad one. I happened to be in the area again a few days ago with my son and his dad so I figured hey why not give it another try because I actually like the menu and the decor in the restaurant. BAD idea. We walk in and it was the same girl as the hostess it took about 5 minutes for her to even acknowledge us because she was chatting with other co workers. Then when she was asking how many another coworker came over and interrupted her and said to go on break then they were talking for a minute in front of us. Again asks how many we say 3 and she rolls her eyes and says hold on. Someone else came over and went to seat us and asked if a high chair was needed I asked for a booster seat and if it was a booth again. You would've thought I asked these people for their first born. The attitudes OMG. So we go back to the front now and wait .. And wait .. Annnnd wait. About 10 minutes I forgot to say there was no one else waiting, no one. I asked the young man that was going to be seating us once if it was going to be much longer and a second time if people were sitting there and we were waiting for them to leave. He told me no that the busser is just slow. Umm OK instead of hanging at the hostess stand chatting it up clean the damn table yourself. Now my son is getting restless so I see the balloons and grab one for him myself since no one offered. We finally get seated and I had to ask for a chalk board for him to use. The waitress was pretty bad as well, inattentive, had an attitude, all of that. My son got the Mac and cheese and so did his dad but his dad's was real and my sons was over cooked soupy Kraft, if you have homemade at the restaurant why would you be using that for the kids? Made no sense. I got a different chicken sandwich this time and wait the best part my bread was stale AGAIN! Also had onion strings on it that were inedible. Honestly there is even more to this but I'm getting tired of writing so in closing I will NOT be returning here.

We also ordered (and shared) the baby lamb chops entree and the classical couscous, both of which were deliriously delicious. During the meal, we had a large pot of the mint green tea.

Being a recent transplant to Oregon, I wanted to find somewhere I can regularly get ramen when I make my infrequent trips to Portland. After being here twice, the food was just as good the second time as it was the first time, and definitely sold me on being a frequent visitor. I've gotten the miso ramen, and garlic tonkatsu shoyu ramen, and both have been great selections. The garlic tonkatsu shoyu has probably been my favorite out of the two due to it's incredibly rich flavor and adds great flavor to each bite of noodles. I ordered a chicken chashu don one of the times, and I would recommend the pork chashu done more. The chicken reminded me of boiled chicken which I didn't like as much, and you honestly can't go wrong with pork chashu. The service was also great each time and I went with my girlfriend during off hours, so we didn't have a long wait time at all.

It seems that this Moretti's on Sawmill seems to get an even better review online, so I was super excited to dine at this Moretti's.The first time we tried to dine here, it was on a Saturday and they were completely booked for the night so we weren't even given the option of waiting for a seat. Fair enough.The second time, we called ahead of time for a reservation and was able to snag a seat. My first impression was that this place is smaller and more cramped than the one in Upper Arlington. No wonder we needed to call ahead for seats!We ordered The Italian Plate (which is basically a huge sampler plate w/ spaghetti, ravioli, chicken parm, Italian sausage, etc.) and their sausage pizza. The Italian Plate was just as good here as it is at the Upper Arlington location... but their pizza crust was thicker and less crispy here. They also didn't have the Angry Italian pizza on their menu, which is my favorite pizza at the UA location. I do wish that they offered the same menu choices between the two locations. The service was good, and overall, we had a good experience. The third and most recent time we tried to dine here (which I believe was 8/3/17), I tried calling throughout the day for a reservation but couldn't get through. It was a Thursdays so we thought maybe we can just walk in and get a seat since the phone wasn't working... then it turned out they were closed that entire week for renovation according to a piece of paper on the front door. They could've left a message on their phone or website...So yeah, even though I love the food at Moretti's, trying to dine here seems to be a lot of hassle.

All I can say is: get the drinking vinegars.  They will make you realize how empty your life had been up until that point the sweet, bubbly, tart nectar hits your mortal lips.  Oh yeah, the wings were great.  The papaya salad was the spiciest thing I've ever put in my mouth.  The boar was sour and lean.  The curry soup was nicely balanced between coconut and spice, and the chicken was practically dripping off the bone, it was that tender.  And their pitchers of water are scented with pandan leaves, which is remarkably tasty and also good at stopping the 4th degree burns that will inevitably occur all over your oral mucosa if you eat the papaya salad.

American Food and Beverage popped up and we snagged  7:00 reservations.  However reservations were not needed when we showed up,  the restaurant was only half full and never really got busy. Overall it's a very nice,  laid back casual restaurant with a great bar.   I'll have to stop by and just sit at the bar the next time. The drink menu was interesting,  however wine prices were pretty expensive,  more than $12 a glass and higher than the cocktail prices.   We ordered a Cosmo and a Hibiscus drink.  My dining companion liked the Cosmo.   My Hibiscus drink was a take on the pisco sour.  It was light,  sweet,  and refreshing.Food menu options were not very interesting.   There were not a lot of gluten-free options and it didn't look like they cater much to those with dietary restrictions.   I ordered the crab cake salad and grilled cheese with tomato soup.   The Crab cake was pretty good,  lots of crabmeat and not a lot of filler.   The grilled cheese was pretty disappointing,  only one cheese was used so was bland and had a one note flavor.   The tomato soup was also average.   My dining companion ordered pork shank with grits.   I sampled some and thought it was pretty tasty.   The only complaint there was the dish was served warm (almost cold)  and they were stingy on the grits. I think I'll give this place another shot.

It was the first meal that we ate and it remained one of my favorites until the end. Our flight landed pretty late so we ended up dining about an hour and a half before they were to close but they were still pretty crowded by the time we left! I really appreciated that their service remained top notch and we didn't feel rushed at any point of our meal. We were allowed the full experience of dining at the restaurant and we enjoyed the chic and modern look of the place.  Their menu is very small and straight forward. We didn't feel like eating oysters so late at night so we opted for the hot entrees. CLAM CHOWDER (bacon, buttermilk biscuits): This was one of the best chowders I've ever had. This chowder was rich, creamy, and had more seafood than potatoes which is the way it should be in my opinion. I thought the hint of bacon running through the chowder was a nice touch and the buttermilk biscuit was a welcoming change to oyster crackers. It was delicious. I only wished that I had more for the price!ETHEL'S LOBSTER ROLL (rosemary roll, cole slaw, kettle chips): This lobster roll was stuffed full of lobster which made this my favorite roll that I ate in Boston. It felt almost sinful to be eating that much lobster and we enjoyed it between the two of us. It was served cold and with mayonnaise which is my preferred way of eating lobster rolls. I thought the coleslaw complemented the roll but the kettle chips didn't really add much to the meal. I found the chips to be slightly on the greasy side. I think I wold have preferred french fries. LOBSTER ROE NOODLES (braised short rib, grilled lobster, oyster mushrooms, Pecorino): This was my first time trying lobster roe noodles and for the most part I enjoyed it. However, I found the dish to be very expensive for the portion that was given us. Also, the dish was dying for some sort of acidity or texture. It felt very greasy and heavy towards the end and I was almost bored of the flavor. Thankfully I had some coleslaw from my lobster roll to cut through some of that richness. I think I would pass on this next time and order something else.  This was one of our favorite meals in Boston and one of our nicest. I highly recommend the Island Creek Oyster Bar if you're looking to impress or just want to have date night. It is a bit pricey though so I wouldn't come often but it's nice every once in awhile.

I'll give any ramen a shot even if I'm pretty sure it won't be special because every ramen deserves a chance. There's a Ramen museum in Yokohama where they have satellite branches of about 10 of the best ramen shops from all over the country. You can spend all day eating amazing Ramen.  That place is great. Ramen is great. Obviously I was pretty excited when driving to work way back in the fall and the little Kukai sign caught my eye. I started looking into it and found out they would be opening in February. Then it got pushed back to April.. then May. No matter... I had Yuzu and Shigezo and even foo foo trendy Boxer with their ham-flavored pork belly, stupid loud music and crappy \\"just be glad we let you pay us to taste our food\\" attitude to tied me over till the real deal came to town. And yes, I understand that Kukai is not THE BEST, MOST AUTHENTIC, EXACTLY LIKE THE BEST IN JAPAN Ramen shop. It's a solid \\"-A\\" player in Japan and here in the US too.  By \\"real deal\\" I mean not just good ramen, but a beautiful space, courteous staff and reasonable prices. After four separate visits and eating about half the menu, its pretty much exactly what I expected. So far I have had:\\nGarlic ramen \\nSpicy Ramen\\nShio Ramen\\nHot Tsukumen (pork and shoyu)\\nMiso Ramen\\nPork Belly \\nWings\\nTakoyakiThe noodles differ depending on the type of soup you get. But across the board, they were all cooked just right- \\"al dente\\" like I like it. The broth(we always got regular but you can go low sodium) was also great. There have been a few small inconsistencies which would be expected for such a new place. It was the soft openings after all(which I highly commend their measured, 2 week long, reservation -or sneak in at lunch - opening). On the service side, on one visit we were waiting upfront  when another group came in after and was seated first and we ended up sitting at the big table in the back next to the busy bathroom, when they got the much better spot. That kinda sucked but hey, again it was a soft opening and the woman that sat us was there all day. I know because I was there for lunch earlier and she was there and this was at like 9 pm and she was still going strong. \\nImy only two dissapoinntments are totally personal preference and not a knock on the restaruant. First,  the soup was just not quite hot enough for my liking. Maybe ok right at first, but it didn't take long to get to the point where I wished I could reheat the broth.  I would imagine that this is so they don't overcook the noodles as they sit in the bowl maybe, but I would just like a hotter bowl of soup. Commendations on being consistent but next time I will just ask for it to be hotter in the first place and hopefully that won't be some catastrophic Japanese faux pas where the chef will need to hara-kiri himself in the back alley. Is that racist?\\nSecondly is the the pork belly. Again, totally subjective here but it just doesn't do it for me. Too fatty/greasy even for belly and it was difficult to eat with chop sticks as it kind of unrolls into a long basically thick piece of uncured bacon. And just FYI Japanese people always compliment me on my chopstick skills... ;) I guess I jsut prefer the kakuni block-style.As far as the service is concerned, it is too early to tell. The vivacious redhead that seems to run the place does a great job. Some of the younger guys werre a little out of sorts but I'm sure they will get into the flow soon enough.

The woman in the phone didn't skip a beat when she told me that was no problem. I ask for dishes without onion everywhere I go and people usually make it seem impossible so I really appreciated her ability to do that for me. Food was ready right on time and for a very fair price. I mentioned that I was in from out of town so the server made sure I had extra napkins and plastic forks in case my air bnb didn't provide them for me (without me asking). I also mentioned that my husband liked his food really spicy so she gave us more of the spicy seasoning to go (again without me asking) which I thought was sweet.

I ordered what I always get when trying a Thai restaurant for the first time (for a fair point of comparison), a Panang curry w/ beef.The curry itself was greasy - not one I'd stir up with rice and enjoy. The beef was just okay, and while I enjoyed the peppers I could barely eat the green beans that were underdone. I don't mind a bit of firmness in my green beans, but these were large and still crunchy. They certainly hadn't picked up any of the flavors of the curry.My wife had a Pad Thai. The flavor was fine but the chicken was overcooked to the point that she didn't eat it.Maybe we just ordered the wrong things (although I'd expect Pad Thai and Panang curry to be pretty common orders), but we probably won't be back."},{"name":"Cupcake Mojo","address":"644 Middle St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"This place is always awesome, and I have been a customer for years.Just want to share a quick review and recommend their services for weddings.

Showed up on time and our table was ready.\\nAs we were led to our table, we walked by their cookies and pizza. Wow! my mom was stoked about the garlic knots.\\nThe dinner menu did not include pizza, so we asked for the pizzeria menu as well. I ordered a glass of the Tuscan red blend and a sweet wine, moscato, for mom. Dad went with water, so I asked for a bottle of Sparkling Pellegrino for the table. Felt like Italy!\\nWe started with the baked clams and the antipasto. The clams had way too much breading but otherwise were tasty. The antipasto was great - a nice variety of meats, cheese and olives etc. The tapenade was a bit sweet, interesting flavor there. The complimentary bread basket was amazing! They take the leftover pizza etc and add it to fresh baked bread. Each piece was totally different. I had one full of cheese, it was so good. Mom wanted the garlic knots, so we had a half order of those. Delicious. The house marinara sauce that it comes with is amazing. Reminds me of my favorite italian restaurant as a kid. \\nFor dinner, we shared the Godfather Pizza, 14\\". I had the Calamari Notte, a squid ink pasta with calamari and red sauce. Mom had the frutta di mare, which was a mixture of seafood over pasta. Dad had the Rigatoni Florentine, which is resembled a vodka sauce with chicken, cheese and spinach. \\nAfter dinner, we had so much food left over. We asked for boxes. The staff brought the dessert cart over, but all I wanted was a cannoli. To  my surprise, they sell cannolis for dessert. One order has two, but its not featured on the dessert cart. So we shared the cannolis and I had a cappuccino.  They don't have decaf, heads up. (I get that real italian places wouldn't have decaf, I've been to Italy. In Italy, you can't get milk in your coffee after breakfast, so it's not traditional to have a cappuccino with dinner anyways, nevertheless a decaf one.)\\nOverall, the food was really great. I was sad that they no longer offer the Branzino, even though it's still on their menu. That is what I really wanted to order. The short ribs will be my next order. \\nMy one qualm - you're trying to run a nice italian restaurant. Nice means relaxed and upscale. So, please advise your wait staff to STOP RUSHING US! I don't need you all over me and our table all night long. When we ask for more time, let us have more time! Let us have time to talk and enjoy our food. Do not bring all our dishes out on top of each other. It seemed as if they were trying to get us through all four courses of our meal in record time. I did not appreciate that. For what we spent, we should have been offered a more pleasant experience. They need to treat this place like a restaurant and not a cafe. People are NOT in a hurry. I won't mention how they screwed up our order because it's probably both of our faults, but I am upset about being rushed.

Why is this place busy when the wings are just no bueno? We did notice it was mostly teenagers eating here so maybe that's where all the business is coming from.The service is slower than molasses. When we walked in we were the first in line yet waited 20 min for our order.The sauces are bad. The spicy Korean Q is supposed to be what exactly? The lemon pepper, highly recommended by the cashier, was basically juice sitting in the basket and the wings sat on top. I suggest he stop recommending sauces to customers. Lastly, the mango habanero wasn't spicy. I actually gave the remaining four of the six wings to Seth.

No matter where he was it felt like he was within reaching distance or atleast he made me feel that way.On to the food... The food is definitely better than most buffets out there. I will say there is an emphasis on sushi at this buffet so the hot food options are limited to one very very crowded section and a line for crab which disrupts foot traffic like a 5 car pile up on the highway. The way to the bar is awkwardly positioned was poorly thought out. People race for food. I waited in the \\"line\\" for crab only to be cut by someone. Overall the quality of food is above most average buffets out there. But you can only taste the quality if there is actual food to taste. Not sure if this was a one night thing. But waiting for certain foods to come out taking forever ruined our experience. On top of that the buffet is way overpriced.  I've heard from others Nori Nori was the spot to go to before they raised the prices. While everything seemed nicer the wait for foods to be refilled was a huge let down.

The location is great and very modern looking inside, although I noticed a lot of the tables were a bit greasy. The cashier was super friendly and helpful. When you order, they ask you a question (ours was \\"if you had a pot of gold, what would you spend it on) and your answer is what they'll call when your order is ready, which I love.I selected the squawking goat ($9), a biscuit sandwich with a big cut of fried chicken and a fried goat cheese patty, covered in pepper jelly sauce. I also ordered fried green tomatoes ($5). My friend got the five with a dime ($10)The squawking goat tastes more brunch/lunch than breakfast. It has strong flavors (savory, tangy goat cheese and super sweet jelly sauce), although I found that they fought with each other as opposed to meshing together, and the chicken and biscuit were mostly overpowered. It's a solid dish, but I wouldn't order it again.Eaten separately, the biscuit was fantastic - fluffy and moist, the way it should be.I ate a bit of my friend's five with a dime, and had immediate order regret. The dish had all the right components of a hearty, comforting breakfast - biscuit, egg, bacon, cheese, sausage gravy. The gravy is some of the best I've had. It's super peppery, thick, and creamy. It was so good I wanted to return the next day to order it, but they're closed on Sundays.The fried green tomatoes were good, the breading was well seasoned and they were cooked just right. Not the best I've had, but the house made ranch they were paired with was a great combo.This is my go to comfort breakfast restaurant so if you're looking for something hearty, give it a try."},{"name":"Tso Chinese Delivery","address":"3909 N Interstate 35, Ste E-5","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I LOVE TSO Chinese Delivery!The first time I ordered TCD was a couple of months ago when I flew in late on a Sunday and didn't feel like running out to get something.

I personally  recommend getting the steak tip. The only reason why I won't give a full five star review is because every time order pizza with meat toppings for some reason the meat is super dried out, almost like a beef jerky texture.  I'm left baffled by it every time because I used to be a pizza cook myself for nine years so you can see why this Bothers me a little. Flavor is great but  you'll probably be throwing away some of the toppings. BUT if you get a Hawaiian or full veggie pizza your going to love it.

We were seated at the exact time of our reservation. The acoustics are great, meaning you can clearly hear the person across from you, and not the people at the table next to you. Our waiter was Rick. He was awesome. His jokes are stale, but his service and knowledge were top notch. I ordered a good rum to start. I usually order it neat, with ice on the side. When Rick said they have king cubes, I was in. We started with the Kobe appetizer. It was melt in your mouth good. I had the ribeye. I ordered it medium rare. It was on the rare side, but no big deal, because it's a great steak either way. We had the creamed spinach and sweet potatoes for sides. Both were excellent. Too stuffed for dessert (and too hungry to take pics, dammit!). I definitely recommend this restaurant."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Ummmm... No. Why do people like this place?  This is a tourist trap I think.After deciding on seafood for dinner, we found this place on yelp and figured it just had to be good based on the sheer amount of great reviews. Wrong. After a long wait, I was so excited about the atmosphere, the selection including the raw bar, and was ready to pay a pretty penny for some delicious food. Too bad it lacked the delicious part.  They have a huge selection of oysters from different local areas. My friend got two different ones, couldn't tell the difference between them and said they were just ok. Then came her lobster bisque and my boyfriends clam chowder. The clam chowder was bearable, but it just tasted like salt and cream to me. My boyfriend enjoyed the biscuits. The lobster bisque was horrendous. It tasted like literal dirt!  Hopefully it doesn't always taste like that.... I am guessing they burnt the butter when cooking it. That's the only thing that could explain that awful flavor.  It was dark brown. Not light pink or even light brown. Something definitely wasn't right. Next came my boyfriends lobster roll, and my 1/2 lobster and shrimp cocktail from the raw bar.  My lobster had zero flavor. I might as well have eaten air. So much for freshness. My shrimp however were the only redeeming part of this meal. They were huge, meaty, and tender. An awesome flavor and the cocktail sauce complimented them well.  The lobster roll was another flop. Since their lobster has no flavor, they smothered it in mayo, dill and relish so that it just tasted like coleslaw. Too bad we paid nearly 30 dollars for glorified coleslaw.In the end, I wept a little when we forked over a boatload of cash for a subpar meal. The one good thing was that they comp'd the bisque because my friend couldnt even eat it (she refused to order anything else because everything we had was so disappointing). The funny thing is we were sitting next to other californians (I heard them talking about King Taco) and I heard the following exchange: \\"well, do YOU think this is good?\\" \\"*frowns and shakes head*\\"I later found out from my boyfriends family that boston is NOT the place for seafood, surprisingly enough.This place is a definite AVOID."},{"name":"Milk & Sugar BBQ Bar","address":"5103 Joyce Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"How convenient is it that these guys opened up right across the sky train station!

It was definitely a go-to place for our family during the summer.  I also like how you can get HK style milk tea and add pearls -- the best classic flavour!  The tea flavour is really strong, which I like.  Sometimes milk tea can taste like water -- and who wants that!?I find it a bit strange how they literally changed nothing about the decor..  there's something kind of haunting about it because when you walk inside it still feels like you're at Bamboo Cafe.

There were a few shops just down the road that we went to prior to being seated!We didn't see the full restaurant but we were seated at a table in the corner. If it were at another restaurant, I probably would've asked for a different one, however as to not delay our dining experience, we went ahead with it.I started off with a Mango Cocktail. I enjoyed it after the first couple of sips, not right away, because it wasn't as fruity as I was expecting, more creamy than anything else. And for dinner my husband and I shared the Het Paa Naam Tok, a vegetarian mushroom salad, and also the Spicy wings. The mushroom salad was interesting, it was light with the lemongrass, mint, & cilantro however for me, it tasted too minty. We liked the wings but they weren't as flavorful as expected.Overall, I don't understand the hype of this restaurant. It's a bit disappointing that we waited for so long.

I always go with the chicken, but they also have glazed bacon, falafel, brisket, and more vegetables.  You have toppings / additions such as cukes and radishes, carrots, marinated eggplant, hummus, babaganoush, baked pitas, crispy onions, the list can go on and on.

I always got their burritos when I was younger. When I started attending college, I still came here, and tried other great things like their tacos (the steak and fish ones are my favorite) and plates of goodness (carne asada plate and chile relleno plate). I even tried their menudo when I was hungover one day on the recommendation of some friends (I decided I'm more into menudo's hot sister, pozole). Over the years, I have managed to try 90% of their menu. As a somewhat successful working adult now, I still make a huge deal about this place and come here religiously after work on Fridays. Don Pedro's is my cheat meal. I order the chile relleno plate ($8.99) which comes with your choice of flour or corn tortillas (how I eat it: slice a nice chunk of chile relleno, put it in a corn tortilla with some rice and beans, pour some of their house made RED sauce on, fold in half and indulge). I skip the salad and tell them to just give me more rice and beans (it depends who you get at the cashier - some will take $3 off the $8.99 and give you more rice and beans in place of the salad and some won't take off $3 and give you more corn tortillas). Either way, skip the salad and see what you can get more of because their salad sucks. I also get 3-4 steak tacos on the side (eat these with fresh squeezed lime and their house GREEN sauce).This location is their first location (also their HQ), so you get to partake in a bar of complimentary slow cooked whole baby onions and jalapeno peppers. There is also fresh salsa and other assorted veggies.I didn't write a review for 10 years because this place is getting more popular by the week and I didn't want it to be so crowded that I couldn't continue having my cheat meals here on Fridays.

It was three of us in total. We sat outside To soak in one of Atlanta's last nice, sunny days of Autumn. Brunch = drinking, so you know we had to try the mimosa tower. We were so excited when the tower came out. The Ivy's champagne tower was incomparable to any mimosa serving restaurant we've ever visited. The champagne was in the tower and the orange juice was in a kraft. One of my friends turned the spout to get some champagne and mildew came out. Apparently they forgot to clean the tower from the last time they used it. And from the looks of it, no one had used it in a very long time. We were absolutely disappointed and brought it to our waitresses attention. She apologized about the mildew (yuck!) and took the tower back, offering to bring us champagne bottles instead. We accepted and intubier with our brunch. However, there was a bit of a dent in our experience from seeing the mold in the champagne glass.We decided to stay and order food despite that experience. We chalked it up to someone simply forgetting to remove the spout and clean it separately rather than viewing the restaurant as generally unclean. We shared the 25 wing order and also ordered a side of fries. The wings were Carolina gold and teriyaki. They were some good wings. It's nearly impossible to have amazing wings in Atlanta. There are so many other places to go for \\"mind-blowing\\" wings. They were not as crispy as I would've preferred them. But they were edible. The sauce accompanying the fries were also delicious. Our server (whose name I've forgotten) was amazing. She was very helpful with rectifying the tower situation and recommending food options. I'm giving this place a three simply because of the tower.

The food isn't anything special but novelty wise it delivers for sure. Griddle in the middle of the table allows you to cook your own pancakes. We showed up around 9am on a Tuesday which allowed us to be seated right away. The main attraction menu is easy: pick your pancake batter (buttermilk, chocolate, peanut butter or vegan/gluten free/something) and any toppings you want to put on/in them (chocolate chips, fruit, bacon pieces, etc). They also have some \\"regular\\" breakfast dishes on the menu. We got one buttermilk pancake base, one peanut butter base, chocolate chips, strawberries and apples. I also ordered the avocado toast off the menu. Took awhile for our waitress to show up and ask what we wanted. She seemed nice enough but kind of aloof...Pancake batter and toppings came to the table pretty quickly (as they should though). We immediately got cooking. It's quite fun even for grown adults and we made some horrible attempts at artistic pancakes. I had a blast with it. Our waitress never really returned to check on us though. We were almost done cooking the pancakes by the time the avocado toast came to the table. I get it's not as easy as premade batter but still.... it's toast. Food wise, it was okay. Nothing really special. Avocado toast: this was okay. It was just one slice of wheat bread with a thin layer avocado on top, along with salt, radish slices and some kind of cheese. I'll be honest. Just put the avocado and salt on this. The radish and cheese felt like a lackluster attempt for more ~flavor~. Just keep it simple, it's not that great anyways. I've made better myself. For $6.50 not necessarily worth it. PB Pancakes with Choc Chips: I wasn't getting much of the peanut butter flavor. It was very subtle and almost missing. However with the chocolate chips the batter was tasty enough and hit the spot. Buttermilk Pancakes: Average tasting. Definitely have had worse pancakes before but good for what you would expect at this place. The glass of milk you get is honestly kind of small. Just a warning.

The waitress provided excellent customer service. The atmosphere and drinks are great if you're looking for a fun night out. Unfortunately, the food does not match the strengths of the restaurant. I ordered a green salsa enchilada with barbacoa. The beans and meat had average taste which matches those of Chipotle. The rice was the worst piece of the food- overcooked, flavorless, and dry. The waitress brought me a freshly cooked dish of rice which was still flavorless. My partner had the chimichanga, and had to dissect it in order to find the limited amount of carne asada meat within it . We found that the food place leans towards quantity over quality.

Our waitress Megan was extremely helpful in helping us gauge the amount of food to order. The Crunchwrap and hotdog were not only beautiful and creative but delicious! We ordered a side of spicy mayo and dunked our crunch wrap in it! For dessert we had the deep fried French toast and it did not disappoint! We honestly wish we had more room to eat because we wanted to order the sushi burger and pizza. That being said we'll definitely be back for more! The only critique I have is the bathroom situation.

Powell's is one of them. Taking up a whole city block, it is the largest independent new and used bookstore in the world. Due to its popularity, it is very often busy. This is unlike a Borders or Barnes & Noble, this place seems to be more of a library than a bookstore because the selection is massive. New and used books all go on the same shelves. There are nine color coded rooms and they are sectioned off by category. They do not use the dewey system to categorize, but it seems like how a library would section off.I have a huge stack of unread books to go through and admit I rarely read books, but I still go to Powell's because there is always some title that piques my interest. They have plenty of discounted books, though they are most often paperbacks or older titles. If you are looking for current bestsellers, you could save considerably by going the online bookstore route instead. Also, Powell's has numerous author signings and so you likely will see autographed books for sale here. For any Seattleite headed south, Powell's is a must visit.

And if the chair was already in position you just heard the buttons being mashed. My friends and I as well as others in the theater tried \\"shhhing\\" but that didn't work. The kids kept talking. The parents didn't do anything. The servers in the theater also did nothing to stop the disruption. I even called a server over to ask them to turn the recliners off. They said they couldn't, but then the server went over and asked the adults to get the kids to stop. That didn't work. The parents found it amusing. The only time a server spoke to that family was when I pushed the button. The rest of the time when the theater kept \\"shhing\\" them or saying \\"be quiet\\" the servers did nothing. The entire 3 hour film the children were disruptive. After waiting 21 films to see Endgame I had to have the movie ruined by this. Then upon leaving employees asked my friends and I how our experience was. At the same time all 3 of us said \\"It was the worst experience we've ever had in any movie theater ever.\\" They asked us what happened, we told them, and they said \\"oh ok, sorry that happened. They didn't call a manager, nothing, they did absolutely nothing. Upon walking out the front doors we were then threatened by another customer who overheard us making a complaint about disruptive children. I tried to contact the theater to file a complaint afterwards and the number provided on the website was hanging up on me. Then I tried contacting their Corporate office which wasn't any better. Their Corporate office basically said they will review their procedures to make sure this doesn't happen again. Still nothing has been done to resolve the fact that me and my group had our movie experience completely and utterly destroyed. I would not recommmend anyone going this theater ever.

Be careful when choosing your level of spicy. My first time here it was so spicy I didn't enjoy eating it. This go around I asked for light spice. They do offer blue crab combos and just shrimp plates. I didn't get a picture because I started eating as soon as I got in the car. I was hungry and I could not wait. It would be perfect if they put some tables outside in the front so people could enjoy their food while it's fresh out of the pot.

Notice I didn't say a completely successful one. When I first heard about Slappy Cakes, I jokingly pondered if diners would have to sign a release prior to sitting at a table with a hot griddle. Not surprisingly they have their legal bases covered in fine print on the menu, \\"Tabletop griddles are hot! Please use carefully at your own risk. For safety reasons, children must stay seated and not reach across griddle.\\" Consider yourself warned.Without any guidance from mom, my boys would be perfectly happy at Shari's, IHOP or Biscuit's for breakfast. And apparently so would some of the writing staff at The Oregonian.

My kids love to cook their own food at Korean BBQ restaurants, so I thought this would be a good fit.The oddest part of our visit is that I walked in thinking this was a family restaurant, but left not entirely convinced this is the best choice for kids. I think their happiest customers may be those wanting to have a little childish fun mixed with adult beverages.I hit it at a very good time, mid-week and zero line. I ordered two types of batter: the standard buttermilk and the more interesting peanut butter. They come in easy to use squeeze bottles. Syrup is provided, but everything else is a la cart. So for a dollar or two, you can start adding sweet and savory items to mix in the batter (berries, bacon bits, chocolate chips). These mix-ins come in relatively small portions.The syrup is where things got a little funky. You have your basic 'Aunt Jemima' type maple syrup, then they also offer house made strawberry and blueberry. Two employees warned us in advance that the berry syrups are vinegar based and we may not like them. They were right. And while I appreciated the heads up, I have to wonder why they don't offer something that many of their customers would like?The side order of bacon was two pieces for $2.50. Cooking on the griddle took a little bit of effort, but was mostly successful. Since we stuck with the 'Pancakes at your Table' menu, the price was fine, but it wasn't unique enough that we'll be back anytime soon.

Thankfully, the quality of food is always good and reliable (with the exception of their tuna salad, which I think is gross). The service is extremely spotty; if you're lucky enough to get a manager to take your order (which only seems to happen when it's mobbed), then you're lucky... Otherwise, good luck.On a positive note, their bussers (the folks who clean the dining area) hustle, so it's almost always neat and clean.

This is one of those hot spots where everybody stops by if they are in town, wait time during dinner was 1-1.5 hours for us, we had to get going so we just did take out which was way faster and ate at a cute picnic table right next door. The wings are a must get item, kind of like going to Din Tai Fung to get the soup dumplings or McDonalds to get fries. All the dishes we ordered was very tasty, I believe it's Northern Thai style. There were a lot of favors in each entree, my breath was kicking in fish sauce aroma though so I don't recommend talking to anybody afterwards without brushing your teeth. Not every item on the menu is available for take out, but also not every item on the take out menu is available for dine in. It's located in a trendy neighborhood so even if there's a wait, there's plenty of things to do and walk to in the mean time, they have a system to text you when your table is almost ready.Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"VisitedÔøΩ?this restaurant with my friend last month.

We both left very full.  I liked the crab/shrimp cakes and they were a great starter.  I opted for the steak as the last time I was here, we sampled a surf & turf and they cooked the steak perfectly.  They did a good job on the steak again this time and I really enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes and the crispy onion rings.  The lava cake was excellent, a perfect compliment of chocolate and vanilla and right portion size to share for dessert.

Kevin Rathbun was highly recommended to me by my cousin, who's opinion for food and the finer things in life, I trust implicitly.Upon arrival, I was pleasantly greeted by the host staff and sat at a nice table all to myself, even though I was dining alone. I was greeted promptly by my server, Tony, who had a wonderful personality. He informed me of the nights specials and gave me some time to peruse the menu. I decided to go with a sort of French 75 cocktail and the bone marrow as an appetizer.  It most certainly did NOT disappoint. The flavor was full and rich and it was roasted to perfection. The cocktail was nice and light and spritzy. Perfect for a warm night out on an Atlanta summer evening. I decided to go with a 10 oz. ribeye, cooked medium rare, for my main course with the accompaniment of the black truffle butter, which was in Tony's opinion, a great selection to add to go with my steak. I also went with a glass of Orin Swift's selection on the menu. The ribeye was cooked outstandingly with a nice crust on the outside and a warm, red center inside. Delicious. The wine was an excellent pair to the steak, as expected.Everything food wise was so on point, here is the reason for my 3 star review: I dined alone. The service and personal touch is where this place seems to lack for me. While my server had a wonderful personality, he didn't really seem to make an effort to make me want to enjoy the dining experience here. Now, he did make an effort to upsell me a few times, which I can appreciate, but I'm talking about the personal touch. Interacting with your guests, finding out about what has brought them to Atlanta or just striking up random conversation; especially for someone who is dining alone in a strange city. I don't know if it's because I'm from New Orleans and I'm accustomed to people who work in the food and beverage industry in that city being incredibly hospitable, warm, welcoming and conversational; but when I go out to dinner, even if I dine alone, I go for the experience of dining out and all that comes with it. A little care goes a long way. Because I dined by myself, that doesn't mean I don't want to be bothered. Quite the contrary. I would've loved for my server to ask me how everything was going, strike up a conversation with me, check on me throughout my meal, make me feel warm and welcome. Not once did he, or a manager, or anybody for that matter, make an effort to stop by and see how my meal was going or do a table touch or just strike up a conversation.  I even declined to get dessert because now I am sitting at my table, finishing my glass of wine, and trying to stretch my dining experience to last a mere hour. So props to this place on fantastic price points and food quality, but maybe work on engaging your guests more on a personal level and bringing your standard of service up to make a more memorable dining experience making them want to come back for more.  Maybe I'm old fashioned or maybe I'm accustomed to the hospitality of New Orleans where, even if you go to a casual dining restaurant, they make you feel as though you're there for a five course meal; or maybe I just don't fit into where this current generation is headed, with they're heads stuck down on their phones.  But I know that when I go out, and I spend the amount of money that I spent here at Kevin Rathbun, I would like my dining experience here to last more than 37 minutes without me having to stretch it out to an hour myself, just finishing a glass of wine and composing this review.I will return to this place again next time I'm in Atlanta. I highly recommend it for the outstanding menu and quality, but I think the service could use a little more of a personal touch.Bon Apetit!"},{"name":"Simha Authentic Multi Cuisine Fine Dine Restaurant & Bar","address":"5486 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd, Ste 13","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a VERY NICE Vietnamese owned FUSION restaurant. They don't just have Vietnamese food here. I think I saw Thai and Chinese influences throughout the menu.  The menu is very big, and consisted of everything from rice dishes [com] to noodles likes pho and bun [vermicelli]. They also have spring rolls and other appetizers. FRIED TOFU [DAU HU CHIEN]\\nI'm not even sure what it said on the menu but I had to read it 5 times before I decided this was what I was looking for. I wanted fried tofu with fish sauce. I think the menu called it TEMPURA TOFU or something. Anyway, the batter was delicious, light, and extremely hot. I loved the dish and would definitely order it again. PHO WITH SPRING ROLL\\nAny type of pho (chicken beef shrimp tofu). The beef pho was very good.The lunch combo doesn't give you the option to just have pho. You'll get the spring roll anyway and they charge the combo price... Which I don't like much.The pho was pure and very tasty. We got it with beef to test out the place and I was very happy with it. Lots of fresh herbs and veggies accompany the pho and we inhaled the bowl. The only thing we would improve is the SOUP SPOON. Please get a deeper, more legit soup spoon. The metal ones they have barely hold any soup so we actually asked them for a plastic soup spoon and were much happier. Some things should just not be changed. Spring rolls were legit and very good. We got them with shrimp and it was fresh and light. The peanut sauce is also very good. COCONUT THAI SOUP\\nThe soup is amazing. The coconut milk was perfect in it and it was a great soup if I was craving for some good Thai soup. You can pick the meat of your choice and I picked tofu because I already got beef broth in the pho. Also, coconut soups just taste amazing with tofu period."},{"name":"Octane Atlanta Tech Village","address":"3423 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I can't believe that I can have a Japanese iced coffee here.

It was one of the only diners that had a good vegan breakfast. I just came back today after not having been since winter and it was actually a horrible experience. If I could give negative stars I would.  Apparently the owners sold the place, and it is much worse. As soon as we walked in we noticed it was different.  Much of the fun art was gone from the walls, and it felt very sterile and unpleasant.  Also, none of the cool, interesting employees we used to know greeted us- they all seem to have left. It was very empty for 9:30 am on a saturday. I ordered an omelette but made with tofu, and it was frankly inedible. It just tasted like they threw a ton of mustard seeds onto a pile of tofu. I took one bite and left the rest on the plate. When the owner cleared our table he didnt bother to ask how it was or why I didn't eat it. I used to get a plate piled high full of food, and this portion was a half plate of sad looking tofu and frozen/flash fried potatoes. We also ordered coffee that we never got, and the owner didn't seem to notice when he cleared our table that there were no coffee mugs, and gave us a bill that included the non-existent coffee. He did apologize and take the charge off though, so that was something at least. We couldnt wait to leave this place,  and as long as it is run by these new people I will not be going back.

Well, that might be a bit harsh, but the flavors, freshness, quality, and that indescribable touch family-run touch made my three visits great. On each of my three visits, I got Al Pastor tacos with soft shells... I'm boring like that, unless I'm in TX at Torchy's, but I digress.Anyways, those tortillas, man... Best I've had. Not only are the tortillas themselves yummy, but I love the way they warm them. They become a little toasty and develop a little fluff too!Regarding protein: they don't skimp on the meat! Each time the Al Pastor has been juicy, flavorful, and overall well balanced, a little sweet, and a little salt, and cooked well! No complaints about the veggies. They were fresh, and there was a decent variety. The only thing missing is some diced raw onion. There was raw onion in their wonderful Pico, but other varieties were cooked or pickled (couldn't tell you... I didn't opt for either).I also had a chance to try the queso! Wonderful stuff! Tasted real, homemade and had a pleasant amount of heat. The guacamole was similarly tasty, and leagues better than that place that starts with \\"C\\", and ends with \\"Hipotle\\".Pro-tip: get the potatoes with queso!

Food: I was pretty excited about the chipotle pastrami for the obvious reasons (I've yet to find something chipotle flavored I didn't like and who doesn't like fresh pastrami). So I got that and my lady got their Turkey, Ham and Swiss with Coleslaw. Being the boy scout that I am I knew this was going to be a sandwich of huge proportions so I planned accordingly and ate a smallish breakfast. I know your dying to know if I defeated that sandwich, and I'm here to tell you I ate my sandwich and about a 1/3 of my wife's sandwich. They were both pretty delicious, perfect proportions of each ingredient and the attention to quality really showed with each and every item on the sandwich (harder and harder to find this amount of respect for each item on a plate these days). We got a side of coleslaw which was pretty frickin huge that we maybe ate 1/3 of. The only thing I will say that isn't a glowing positive is that I thought the spice on my sandwich was a little weak. I'm not saying that it wasn't tasty but I was expecting a little more kick based off of the name. Service/Ambiance: This place runs like a well oiled machine/cattle slaughter house. By that I mean you stand in line with a tray order at the deli counter walk down towards the cashier tell them what you've ordered (by then you most likely have your sandwich). Find an empty table and conquer that mountain of a sandwich. Its a pretty noisy place due to all of the people packed in their like sardines, so don't expect a romantic/private setting. Bottom Line: Definitely recommend this place to someone wanting a sandwich in the Boston area. Several people complain about the prices, but you have to factor in the quality of ingredients, sheer mass of the sandwich, and the fact that this place is downtown. I was so full from my lunch I didn't even eat dinner that night, so considering that I would say its a pretty good deal.

It's not that the food itself wasn't good @ Morton's----it was quite good. The occasion for going was more than worth it: the birthday of a dear, dear man I love more than my own life, who always wanted to go to Morton's. To be fair to him, I never let him see the receipt; I grew up w/this man; he would have had kittens if he had known it was gonna be so expensive (I don't even think any of us had any adult beverages with that meal, in case you're wondering. None of us were big drinkers, so certainly no more than 1 drink apiece).\\nHere's the thing: if you're willing to part with several hundred bucks for a meal with your nearest and dearest, are YOU looking for dainty, attractive presentation, e.g.,  3 spears of asparagus and a tiny, symmetrical dollop of taters? B/c I'm just not that guy--- what can I say? Morton's ain't French, and I sure as heck wasn't expecting amuse bouche. True--I ordered the biggest, baddest steak they had--- a 48 bleepin' ouncer. You might say-- what the heck are you worried about sides for, w/that much quality protein? It's cos I happen to want the option of either taking a box home, or ostentatiously leaving an unfinished plate. I believe we have paid plenty for that right, thank you very much.\\nHere's the other thing: It's steak. STEAK. Fantastic steak is NOT hard to do. True, you're better off if you're willing to spend a little more and go through a butcher who knows what they're doing. Let it be granted I am one spoiled mo-fo with my Traeger grills. But I've had great steak from friends with either charcoal or propane or (best of all) Imu pits. It's not as though there is some unfathomable algorithm or calculus involved in making great steak. But it is part of a skill set I think every man should have. Another in this non-negotiable list includes successfully macking random females on public transit, as well as building a WWWIII and WWWZ- proof bunker, but that is a pretty substantial digression.\\nMorton's--- how do you do it? How do you stay in business on such a flimsy premise? Are there THAT many fools out there with way too much money, who think the dollar total on the cheque is an essential part of the experience and come back to you, over and over?

I learned about it through word of mouth - the best form of advertising. People's mouths are generally a lot different than mine however. I appreciate great taste, but for a 5 star rating, I would need to he impressed by the amount of care put into the food and its ingredients. By care, we are talking local, authentic, possibly organic - pok pok is average in this category. They're probably a 4-5 star on the authenticity, but subpar, especially for Portland, in the quality of the ingredients, except for the chillies which they grow themselves - that is fabulous. Due to how much acclaim this restaurant has been given, I wanted to ask my waiter some detailed questions for my unbiased assessment of the restaurant. Now I don't have the full picture, just a snippet, but far more than the average customer has because I ask some serious questions 1. I first asked her about my particular dish: where do the ingredients come from? I ordered the catfish on vermicelli (forget the exact name of the item). The catfish to my surprise is from Vietnam, and farmed. So it has traveled for a very long time, and isn't even wild caught, so its nutritional composition is inferior to the fish people in Vietnam eat when they fish themselves. -1 for authenticity, -2 for not being green. 2. I asked about the \\"turmeric oil\\" that my dish was cooked with. I told my waitress that I had never heard of it. At this point I could tell she switched on \\"patience mode\\" but it didn't last very long as I'll explain; she snapped at me at the end. So the turmeric oil is just turmeric steeped in rice oil. That's pretty cool, but it's not turmeric oil. Again, the reason this is important is because they have a good reputation and I made the decision of casually investigating it during my lunch. So after my meal, I asked the above question and she eventually snapped and said she has \\"other things to do,\\" so I asked the man at the bar who put me in contact with the chef indirectly. 3. I asked waitress to elaborate on each ingredient on the menu and she did kindly, but that was before her patience ran out so she was very kind \\n---\\nThe food itself now was delicious, and was handsomely garnished with lemon balm or some other type of mint. The mint did not taste fresh, but it still added a lightness to the meal. This catfish meal was provided with a fermented fish sauce, that added sweetness and tanginess to the meal, and yes I had to ask the waitress what was in the sauce. The quantity of food was meager; I hadn't eaten breakfast so I was hoping for more. The amount of food served at a typical thai food truck in portland serves more food, for about half the price or less (this meal cost 15). Resultantly, I devoured it in minutes. The vermicelli was also on the oily side - it tasted good but I'm not sure if that's normal for a thai dish. All in all, a nice place to eat but I will probably not be back - it's overpriced (unless they can make a compelling case for the cost), and the lunch and dinner menu is the same; this means that the small lunch I had is going to be a small dinner for someone else, which is worse. Lastly, they should add some more info on this website so people get a better idea of this place. I'm still open to believing that this restaurant is very good/authentic, but I have no idea what that is based off of.For a more unbiased review I should try some of their other items which customers seem to love. Maybe I will."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Totally over rated, too expensive, too crowded, and food is adequate. Parking stinks too.

Like anyone else, vegetarians go to places that are not our choice. This review is for people like me who go out with their friends and make the best of it - whether or not the menu caters to us. I gave them 4 stars, it was honest and not cruel. And I started my review with that caveat that I am a vegetarian. So please, refrain from telling me not to go there. My friends love it and I love my friends so I will keep going and completely stand behind my 4 stars :p In all fairness, it's tough for a vegetarian to review a restaurant with the word \\"Oyster\\" in its name. However, since we've been \\"dragged\\" here so many times with our oyster-loving friends, it's only fair to provide a review from our perspective. First, we LOVE the ambiance in here. The decor with all the oyster shells is lovely. Second, we have been coming here for years and the mixed drinks never disappoint. The menu changes often which we appreciate and they'll even do their best to create a drink based on what you're in the mood for. So, why not 5 stars? I think they could have better vegetarian options. When we go to a nice dinner with friends, it feels childish to order a series of appetizers and call it a meal. Although the asparagus soup is super yummy, it isn't a meal. Nor is a salad...particularly when our friends order that same salad to come WITH their meal. And more often than not, the ONE meal option for vegetarians is full of mushrooms. Surprise! Many vegetarians (and meat eaters) are not a fan of fungi! I get it...you can't please everyone.

Some highlights:  There was a very cool section of books that have received the Coretta Scott King Award.  I love that this selection of books was highlighted and I hope it leads more families to choose one to purchase.  There was also a good selection of graphic novels for children (my 7-year-old daughter picked one out about a girl and her unicorn friend). Finally, as an educator I LOVED that there are little tags around that have hand-written recommendations for kids and teens for the books on the shelves.

And funnily enough almost all of my subsequent visits have been with out-of-towners.  It is one of Portland's landmarks and a very dangerous place if you love books.  When I returned this weekend, after a long absence, I was shocked to discover that Powell's was founded in 1971.  It just seems like one of those places that has been around forever and (I hope) always will be.  I was also comforted by the fact that everything looked the way I remembered it.  No fancy, schmancy remodels here.  I spent most of my time (I gave myself a time limit) in the Red and Purple rooms.  I was trying to find a few specific things and the staff was quick and helpful and didn't need to refer to anything on-line.  They just immediately knew where everything was.  I tend to pick an author and then read everything they've written, and in most book stores they only carry a fraction of an author's work.  At Powell's they carry everything.  So cool. There is a huge selection of children's books, including vintage items, that you just don't find other places.  And so many choices of those insanely cute Timbuk2 messenger bags, which are on my current crush list, and probably the entire line of Knock Knock products (goofy lists and notes).

Our party of 3 tried the corn dog shrimp and the pretzel and pimento appy's.  There were 4 of each one served, just right for an appetizer portion.  The sauce served with the corn dog shrimp makes this dish, otherwise it was average. The pretzel sticks were hot and the pimento spread was spot on.For main courses we went with salads and I hate to say these were VERY average.  My caesar salad was short on dressing and the piece of salmon added was baked or sous vide, just bland. Grilling it would have made all the difference.  The fajita steak salad was in same boat.  Very average. The meat is only served medium or well done and is not very flavorful.  The cornflake chicken salad was best of the three, and the rosemary fries we ordered for the table were a yummy hit.The big plus of the night was the peanut butter mousse pie we shared.

I cancelled the reservation. There are a few problems with this, the first being that rescheduling is NOT the same thing as a cancellation and should not be treated as such. Secondly, talking to me like I am an idiot is uncalled for. I will certainly be going to this location to talk to the manager regarding this--it is unacceptable to charge a cancellation fee for a reschedule and then expect a patron to have any desire whatsoever to then give the restaurant their business."},{"name":"Sichuan Gourmet","address":"91 Middlesex Turnpike","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Enjoyed a dine in lunch experience recently.

Their texture and taste are exactly like those vacuum-sealed noodles found in shelf-stable inexpensive noodle bowls in Asian grocery stores. 2/5Location: the restaurant is very well decorated and noisy.

I am so happy that I found this restaurant.Ordering from the website was easy and painless. I was pleased to find that the prices included sales tax already (and apparently delivery, though I opted for takeout), and tipping was not allowed. I could see my order go into the \\"cooking\\" stage within a minute or two from my account order page. I was able to pick up my food 15 minutes later from a very pleasant hostess, and when I got home I was surprised by the quality of the food. (I ordered General Tso Chicken with steamed rice.) The pieces of chicken tasted fresh--large chunks of delicious white meat with no discernible gristle--and the sauce was perfect--flavorful with a kick, but not too spicy! I've also noticed that I can be sensitive to food that is too salty, but the GT chicken seemed very appropriately salted. In addition, I deeply appreciated the quality plastic packaging for the chicken, and I wonder if it played a role in the food not getting soggy on the trip back home.Thank you, Tso Chinese Delivery, for providing such a delicious meal (with plenty of leftovers) at a reasonable price. Please don't change anything about the General Tso recipe--it's perfect! I have no use for any other takeout/delivery Chinese restaurants in Austin anymore.

Is it because of certain biases - for example, The avocado key lime pie - I love a good key lime pie and this doesn't really taste like a key lime so I'm not sure if I would be running back to this over a good key lime elsewhere.The jackfruit burger was good too, but again burgers elsewhere would be better. I keep looking for an item that stands out here that is done better than elsewhere, even for non-vegans, and I haven't quite found it yet. But would I complain to come here again - no.

Alan also pointed me to the accessible website for ordering food. When I mentioned my allergies, Alan suggested a substitute sauce so that I could enjoy my #1 choice, the Swami. Alan was also very clear in explaining the different kombuchas. When my friend wasn't feeling well enough to stand up and bring her credit card to the register, rather than put her through the hassle, Alan even comped her a free drink. The food was also delicious. The garlic sauce, kale, rice, and other ingredients were in perfect balance with just the right level of seasoning. Not only was it delicious, it sat well in my stomach afterwards and energized me, just as the restaurant name suggests. I loved it so much that I went back the next morning for a Vibrant smoothie and experienced Alan's excellent service once again. An added note, which may seem insignificant to others, but was incredibly rare and special for me: this is the one and only time I've ever had a customer service experience without once being called by the wrong gender.

Finale is a concept that mirrors that of Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego. It gives you a place that focuses on desserts to satisfy your sweet tooth. This gives people on dates a great place to impress that special someone. They even have a portion of the menu dedicated to sharable desserts for two. Anyway, I came here with a friend to try their dessert. Nothing stuck out on the menu so I settled for the hot fudge sundae because I was craving fudge at the time. It didn't look like much and it was pretty small, but it hit the spot and had everything in the right proportions. I hate it when there's too much fudge that overwhelms the ice cream in a fudge sundae. The brownie bites were good and the Tahitian vanilla ice cream satisfied my stomach. This was in the late afternoon so I basically ruined my dinner. On the way out, I grabbed two types of cookies, the peanut butter and also the walnut chocolate chip. They were over two dollars each and didn't really wow me. They were good tasting, but too rich and dense for my liking. Finale is a nice place to share a dessert, but a place like this should impress me both in dessert taste and presentation. Basically, I think the dessert quality did not match up with how nicely the restaurant seemed to be. Some items were a bit overpriced too.

You pour the salsa from the cruet into individual dishes...one for each diner which is especially great if you're eating with anybody who tends to be a double-dipper.  In addition to the salsa that comes with the chips, there is a salsa bar where you are free to go up and select as many of the various salsas and dips as you would like to try.  We especially liked the mango salsa.  This is a fun touch.To drink, I had a regular margarita which was strong and delicious and thankfully not overly sweet. I was asked if I wanted a salted rim and I said yes.  There is an elaborate tequila menu so if you have a special tequila that you like, chances are they have it. My husband had a draft beer.He ordered  pork carnitas enchiladas which he thought were delicious.  I had the chiles rellenos which were excellent! They are beer battered roasted poblano peppers stuffed with Oaxaca cheese and covered with poblano queso sauce and cilantro crema.  This is one of my favorite Mexican style dishes and one I love so much I have made it at home.  This version did not disappoint.  The flavors of the peppers came through nicely which means they weren't overwhelmed with cheese and sauce.We were quite full so when Sergio returned to ask us about dessert we declined so I can't say that I've seen that menu.After this pleasant lunch-time visit we returned a few nights later after work just for a drink and an app.  My husband and I met at the bar.  I again had a salted-rim margarita and he again had a draft beer. The chips and salsa were brought out and again we tried a few of the salsa options from the salsa bar.\\nFor our appetizer we got the taquitos. What arrived were 3 mini-tacos which were actually quite substantial not to mention quite delicious. They were crispy corn tortillas stuffed with roasted poblano peppers, corn, potatoes, caramelized onions and a mix of melted cheeses.  They are served with slaw, pico de gallo, avocados and cilantro crema. \\n  \\nWe chatted with the bartender Carlos who moved here recently from southern California at the request of the owner who wanted him to work at her restaurant.

All were delicious...My friend wasn't too keen on the burger but he didn't seem put out by it either so I suppose it was passable. The corn flake chicken was killer.

It came out warm, cozy, and comfortable like a big warm blanket fresh from the dryer on a cold wintry evening. It just enveloped you in its dark, soft, chocolate-y love and resounding velvety soft crumb. Oh. So. Good.

Excellent all around. The only hitch was finding the place because there is some construction going on in the area. Also, taking a $20 reservation deposit per person (for a Thursday evening reservation) is a bit much. I understand their rationale, but the place was not crowded at all when we arrived. Now, getting to the good stuff. The service was fantastic. Everyone was  friendly and warm. My wife and I both liked our wines very much. We started with the pork belly which was wrapped in some sort of a fresh dough (which looked a bit like a Bao). It was delicious, although the pork belly itself was a bit too chewy. The lobster mushroom pasta was my favorite. Oh, the flavors --- I could live on that :). The Duck in mole sauce was excellent as well. Both the dishes were on the larger side of tapas. Finally, the banana cinnamon bread pudding was delicious as well.

The only thing I can figure is that it's the marketing and hype or lovers of this place have never had really great biscuits and gravy or both. :/Biscuits are not meant to be chewy. Flaky and crumbly are an option biscuits, but never chewy. This dough is way over worked. Also, gravy is not supposed to taste of raw flour, nor is it supposed to be separating due to the over the top fat content. Good gravy is balanced.

It was the only Vietnamese spot in the area and I liked to complain about the prices. Hahahaha oh how young and naive I was back then. What I would give to have Dua close to my new job in Sandy Springs. Sadly, the only Vietnamese place close to here is Com. And compared to them, Dua was a freaking bargain. My pandan rice combo with beef added was $9.50. All lunch combos come with a fountain drink. Hot tea is an extra $.50. Pricey. And to me, not worth it at all. The beef was the same quality beef you'd find in your cheap-o Chinese delivery beef fried rice. My co-worker, however, ordered the large pho, which was a whopping $9.00. And that's just broth with noodles. Meat is extra. If I'd wanted regular old beef pho like I'd find on BuHi, it'd be $3 extra, making my lunch $12 freaking dollars. My co-worker just added vegetables, which were $2.25. So her lunch was $11.25. And the size of the \\"large\\" pho? Barely comparable with a small at a BuHi joint. Now here's the really bizarre part. The pork and shrimp egg roll appetizer is $5.50 for two egg rolls. Which is pretty expensive to begin with. However, if you order the pandan rice combo (which starts with just the rice at $4) and want to add on one pork and shrimp egg roll, it's SEVEN DOLLARS. At this point, I'm partly convinced this place is just trolling us. Because in what world does it make sense to pay $7 to add ONE egg roll to a mound of $4 rice rather than get TWO egg rolls as an appetizer for $5.50?I'll give that the decor and ambiance of the place are a far cry from the no frills atmosphere of a typical BuHi pho place. But jeebus. Their pricing is ridiculous and nonsensical. And the food was only okay. The service, though, was good, so I give them two stars instead of one.I'll also note that the Scoutmob deal is not good for lunch combos. Found that out the hard way. That was our fault for not reading the conditions. So if you want to use the Scoubmob, you must order off the regular menu, which is even MORE expensive. For example, the same dish I ordered off the lunch menu for $9.50 is $13.25 on the regular menu. If you come here because you're too scared to go to Buford Highway (yes, those people exist), then you deserve to pay way-too-fucking-much for the food here. Everyone else, just go to BuHi.

Great service without making you feel uncomfortable. At some nice restaurants I feel as if the servers would give me their first-born sons if I requested. I got the 12 oz filet mignon, medium rare. Highly recommend the black truffle butter with it...heavenly. Paired the steak with an equally delicious cabernet franc from Italy. Also had many good things to say about the mac and cheese, though the side portions are a little too small to be shared. For dessert we ordered one of each, and while each more than satisfied my sweet tooth, my favorites were the creme brulee and the bon bons. I'm not ashamed to say I had to unzip my pants to help me breathe on my drive home.

It was just not the same under its new name/ ownership. SAD. We had it under good authority ( Cindy A. and the friendly cute guy in the car next to us when we tried \\" Lebanese Kitchen\\") , that Welcome India is good. So a couple weeks later I called in two orders of butter chicken, a chicken tikka masala,a  sag paneer, and 3 pieces of naan. Entrees come with rice and are fairly reasonably priced. I ordered it with medium spice. My kid gave the favorite butter chicken a 5. It was not remotely spicy but it had a lot of big chunks of chicken. The naan was devoid of any char but buttery and soft. It is $2 per half circle. There was enough food from one entree  for two teen meals.  Perpetually hungry kid was satisfied. I shared the chicken tikka masala, the second butter chicken, and the sag paneer with my kid's dad, my ex, who has been doing repairs at our house around dinner time. I think that is intentional but ok. We feed him. The sag was not at all spicy, it had plentiful cubes of cheese ( which is good because teen swipes them even after being reminded that you earn those by consuming the spinach!),and  it has a less creamy texture than other sags. I liked it. But I found it a little underseasoned. The chicken tikka was fine. But here is the problem, it was virtually identical to the butter chicken and they are two different things. I know this because my ex and I argued about it and became google warriors trying to figure it out and prove each other wrong. This might be why we are not married anymore. Just sayin'. This tikka ( also not spicy) consisted of  unseasoned breast chunks in a sweet creamy orange sauce that was almost exactly the same color as the other one. In my pics they looked a little different ( of course I cannot find the tikka photo now) but on the plate,  well notsomuch. Chicken tikka masala is allegedly ( according to the 6,305 references we examined) marinated in spices, grilled, then a gravy is added. This was not that.As my ex pointed out, butter chicken was not on the menu but they tried, possibly by adding cream to the tikka?? I am not sure.  We each had leftovers for lunches, too. Which was nice. For the chicken dish issue and the lack of spice, I said  it was a 3. I may be an Irish white girl, but I have eaten a LOT of Indian food both in California and Oregon including at Indian people's houses ( because of the large Asian Pacific Islander population in my neighborhood)  and there was a lack of spice here. Maybe she didn't think we could handle it, my teen said. Both kid and ex asserted it is a solid 5 because of the pricepoint, the large amount of chicken in both dishes, the nice people, and the proximity to our house. So okay,we landed at four. The cute guy in the next car that one time raved about the biryani, so next time we are getting that."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Super fun for a family experience.

Three of us got the scramble with mushrooms, goat cheese and spinach and we all thought it was fantastic.

It is only two pieces but we had 3 different people order it and none of us ate more than a bite or two of ours which was a shame because a lot of each order went to waste but this is yummy and worth a try. The service was good but they definitely need more wait staff as the place became packed and there were only 3 waiters to help everyone.

I didn't even have a Yelp account until tonight.We sat down in our theater seating and pressed the button to order a couple of drinks. Solange greeted us promptly and began taking our order, only handing our party of three one menu to pass amongst ourselves. My girlfriend attempted to order their Spiked Machiatto but was informed after Solange yelled through her microphone multiple times (assuming to the kitchen/bar staff) to see if they had it available. After no response, she informed us that they no longer had it in inventory. My girlfriend was understanding and proceeded to just order a strawberry milkshake. Because we had to pass the menu amongst ourselves to figure out what we wanted for dinner, we needed time to figure out our entree was. Solange told us that if we wanted to put anything else in, that the kitchen closed at midnight and that we needed to hurry. Kind of odd considering the showing starts at 11:15 pm and the movie didn't end until roughly 2:30 am, but we understood and hurried to figure out what we wanted a few minutes after she went to put in our drink order (supposedly).When we were ready to order, we pressed the button on our seat. Another server came to greet us that I didn't catch the name of, and asked what we wanted to order. I told her we already had placed an order with someone, but we wanted to put our food in since the kitchen was about to close. We placed our food order (we did the 2 for $29 deal which consists of one appetizer to split and two entrees, and an additional dessert option for $5 more) and she said that she would check on our drinks and put our food order in. Great - all set up to watch the movie!Since our third person ordered separately but at the same time as my girlfriend and I, we noticed that the entirety of his order came before ours did (including the alcohol). We figured since we also ordered an appetizer and two entrees that it would have longer prep time, so we weren't bothered with the additional wait. Finally, a food runner brings us our nachos to share. No drinks still. We kindly asked our runner to see if she could check on our drinks and informed her what we were missing. She then proceeds to tell us that they're \\"completely out of ice cream so there's no way we can make milkshakes tonight\\". Okay - then we should have been informed when we ordered and not sit here for twenty minutes waiting for items we expected. I still haven't received my drink at this point as well, however, I feel it was a lost cause to remind someone about it after the third time and 30 minutes into the movie showing, and I hated having the wait staff literally blocking my view just so they could inquire about my order in a hushed yelling tone of voice. So here we are, 45 minutes into the movie. Our third person is munching on his burger, sipping his beer and content with his order while we are literally sitting here with a bowl of chicken nachos served lukewarm, a glass of ice water that a runner thought that we had ordered (we didn't, but at this point I would take anything to drink), and no entrees or drinks whatsoever. We never saw Solange or any of the servers again once the movie started, and my girlfriend was so disappointed with the food runners only coming to us to deliver bad news, that she literally had to tell them to, \\"Just go away and stay away.\\"So the movie is near its end and the food runners are left to pass out the checks. Lo and behold, we are still charged a total of $54 for every single item that we ordered, but only received about $6 worth of items! As the food runners came to collect our payment, I told her I was keeping it and would speak later and she ran off. The movie ends and my girlfriend, who at this point is starving due to expecting to have dinner after work at the movies, is furious and upset. We speak to Brad, the current manager of the evening about the experience being completely unorganized and insulting to guests. He said that \\"they're still learning and they're only three weeks old. We apologize, here are some free tickets for next time and don't worry about the check.\\" And passed us off. As someone who has worked primarily in Food Service and leading Hospitality locations across Orlando, this entire experience was incredibly poor, heavily unorganized, and lacking communication across all departments. Where did our order being taken by not one, but TWO servers allow our orders to intentionally get thrown out except for a bowl of nachos, and then at the end everything pops back up in the check that we ordered it?Good luck lasting another month with this staffing."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh man the pulled pork is where it's at!

Our waitress came and took our drink order promptly.  Service was actually the best part of our visit.  Small little place that's located in a small strip plaza. Cute decor and friendly staff. Restrooms are small and not very clean, FYI. We ordered our meals -- my hubs and I ordered the Stoppe Trio which is 3 meatballs of your choosing and served on beans, polenta, or noodles. We both chose polenta and it comes with a side salad.  My meatballs included the chicken parmigiana, Original Italian, and a special one that they didn't have in the menu, polenta and cheese. My hubs meatballs included the sausage and peppers, Original Italian, and the Pork. My friend ordered the trio as well and her meatballs included the crab, chicken Marsala, and Original Italian. My favorite of the evening was the special polenta one then behind that was the original Italian. The polenta one was cheese and crispy on the outside and the Italian was garlicky and just good. My husband's favorite was the Italian one. He didn't like his pork one. The food was not all that hot -- even the polenta wasn't warm at all. The cheese on my chicken parmigiana one was settled onto the ball which meant that it sat for a bit before served. My friend had to actually send her food back because the chicken Marsala ball and crab ball were refrigerator cold. The waitress apologized and assured that they were making hers fresh but when she got the plate back the Marsala one was warm but the crab one was still cold. My daughter ordered the baked ziti and I didn't take a picture but it didn't look that great, flavor wise it was just ok. Nothing to comment solely about. She did order the Mac and cheese meatball and loved that. I did taste it and it was actually really good. My friends hubs ordered the smash with an egg and buffalo chicken ball. He devoured it and said that it was good but that the buffalo chicken needed more spicy. The egg was cooked to perfection!  If you Yelp check in here you'll get a free cannoli. Which I didn't taste but they said was good. Immediately after leaving my daughter got sick and puked.....and our tummies hurt even this morning as I'm writing this review. I believe that they make the balls ahead of time, not sure how far in advance, and refrigerate them to heat them up when served. That's the only explanation I can give for the reason of the balls not being piping hot like food should be when freshly made and served.

If you have visitors from out of town, take them here for a Western dining experience.I find Rudy's food to be a little expensive so a meal there is considered a treat.On an odd note, I observed their patrons to be overwhelmingly male during a weekday lunch.

If its busy, the service will be appallingly slow (but friendly), and even if its not busy, the service will just be of average slowness (but still friendly).They play a good selection of tune, sometimes too loud, and overall I like the feel of the place - low lights, interesting decor, and lots of booths.

On the other hand, I've known Chef Andy a while now, and I can't even remember the last time I looked at the original Soto menu: I walk in, he makes stuff, and I feel pretty good about myself. If you have any concerns about the Art of Sushi at Soto South Lamar, that won't be an issue. But what you will notice is your tiny black dress: If Soto North is sedate upscale casual with occasional flashes of hipster - and who doesn't love their salmon on fire or giant bowls of ice bathed in blue light - then Soto South may come across as unexpected tea ceremony presentation. Every dish I saw was a small painting - colorful, subtle, and all quiet elegance on muted new stoneware. It's the raucous South Lamar ambiance here that will slap you silly with its hip & cool and loud & vibrant. Will you be impressed? Well, are you impressed in Uchi & Odd Duck across the street? Then yes, you'll be impressed.I should disclose I only focus on what I'm being served at the sushi counter, and I only watch the chefs working behind it. I don't pay much attention to the dining room or bar behind me. Maybe next time. Okay, maybe not. You can see pics of our soft open service, I'm just not certain what'll be on the permanent menu. And the current plan for Soto South Lamar is dinner only, by reservation, Tuesday through Saturday. But you can still do lunch with Chef Andy at Soto North. And this may all change by opening day. See what I mean about tweaking?I'll end this with one final thought: If I had to pick one thing that made Soto South Lamar a five star experience for me, it's pretty simple - the Uni pasta is so good, I never want more than three or four bites of it, because I don't want to tarnish the joy of indulgence. Does that make sense? It's the anticipation that makes it go a long way. And that's pretty much as good as it gets.

Their food is standard Southern fare and it's done with decent quality. They are a buffet style restaurant that caters to families. The price is ok, at $9.15/person with water to drink at dinner time. The lunch price is better. However, fairly often, the food is left out too long and gets a bit dry. The overall quality of the various dishes is good. The Mac and cheese could use a little sprucing up, but it's still OK. The dining room is in a bit of a state of disrepair, but it's just showing it's age. They keep the place pretty clean, but you'll see. Rumble and such around during busy hours. That's normal for a buffet. What's not normal is how many times I've been served a dirty set of utensils- literally every time I've ever been here. This time, I put the dirty butter knife on my plate (for them to take it away) and they took it off the plate, took out a napkin, and set it back on the table.  I tried a second time, and when I got back to the table, they'd taken it. I love their fried chicken livers and (when they have it) their fried catfish! The grilled pork chop (when freshly grilled) is pretty tasty too.

The fried calamari tasted very fresh and the cocktail sauce side was really good. When the green chile macaroni came out, I was apprehensive because it looked like mac and cheese and I'm not a fan of cheesy, creamy pasta, but I was pleasantly surprised because it had a nice cajun flavor to it, with some slight heat and spice to it!It was definitely worth the wait and definitely a restaurant I would come back to again in the future when I visit Austin again :)"},{"name":"Focaccia","address":"2 Lowell St","city":"Wilmington","stars":"2.5","text":"A group of 11 of us went for a birthday dinner, the food is TERRIBLE, not ONE of us even remotely enjoyed our food, I had the Lasagna, worst i've ever had, the meatballs I ordered to go with it where dry and gross!

To add fuel to the fire, the food is unique and refined, with items such as poutine and shishito peppers rounding out the menu and experience.In regards to the feel, servers are welcoming, but not necessarily warm. It seems to me they want to give you space, which I can appreciate. With an eclectic interior and a spacious outdoor space, Weather Up can cater to groups big or small.

This is completely different and not in the way you might think. It's not like the Thai/Japanese place around the corner or the Asian melded combo shops doing neither well. This is a blending of food and flavors across borders.I found it perfect to come here with adventurous eaters with healthy appetites because of the family style serving allows you to try many dishes. First off the d√©cor is nice. It's unique, warm inviting. Service is good, very traditional and non conforming. I ate with my hands, no problem as that's normal for my culture and it was encouraged.We tried all the appetizers, love the wings and the papaya went well in cleansing your palate as the wings are a little intense when you go hot, not because of the heat, but the flavors and the heat in whole. The rotisserie bird was good, moist, full of flavor, but not something I couldn't make at home. The spices and flavor profile was clean. Go with their suggestion to get rice off the bat with these.Keeping it light we went with the steak salad, stewed duck, boar collar, ribs, all with sticky rice except the stew we went with jasmine. I'm not a fan of coconut rice.Steak salad was clean, refreshing, steak was spicy. The mint and cilantro are the main culprits. Stewed duck was intense,  with the vinegar sauce, soy broth and tons of spices was too much to indulge. Very rich, do not get if you a sodium issues. The boar collar is kind of like the fish collar, great flavor, but unlike the fish it's not more than any other part, even for the boar. Love the coriander and sugar carmelization. Ribs reminded me of Szechuan with the whiskey bite, ginger and sweetness. Kind of without the numbing sensation of schezuan. Good dipping sauce, but not to be eaten like American BBQ ribs, it's not quite fall off the bone where the sauce needs to go on it, this is dipped, both sauces given are varying degrees of hot. The drinks, oh my, rival the food. I'm a Scotch/Whiskey man so the fact they had Lagavulin, my current favorite is a star in and of itself and they carry 2 Japanese Whiskey's which are killing it at comps.  Red Breast and 3 dozen bourbons. Minimal wine selection.

With that said, the Framingham Panera is really terrible. I recently went in for a quick dinner while running errands on a Friday night at around 6:30pm. I decided on you pick two with half a sandwich and soup. I chose a Panini with avocado. They informed me that they didn't have avocado. I picked a different Panini, and they didn't have the bread or the spread for that one. Finally, I picked a turkey sandwich and asked that it be made as a Panini since I'm pregnant and I cant have deli meat unless it's been heated up. I asked to dine-in and went to get a drink while I waited. They had no lids for my medium drink. When my name was called, everything was in a bag. I told them it was supposed to be for here, and they offered to give me a plate. I said no thanks and sat down. My soup was 1/2 full and the sandwich looked as if it had been tossed on the press for 10 seconds. the cheese was not melted and the turkey was cold. I returned to the counter and nicely asked them to remake everything, and this time, make it for here. The manager rudely asked me \\"what's wrong with what you have?\\" when I listed the problems, he huffed and said \\"fine we'll give you a new meal\\" - never an apology or offer to refund me. \\nEven if this Panera is the most convenient place for a quick meal, I wont be back."},{"name":"Allston Diner","address":"431 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm devastated.

The waitstaff was super nice and there was just honestly nothing not to like about it (except perhaps the weird sinkhole in the booth seat haha).But now... we gave it two tries just in case one was a fluke, and it was worse the second time than the first (at least the first still had the good home fries). New management, the entire staff from before either was fired or quit, and the food is now terrible and like twice as expensive. They took down the fun decor but randomly left some of it up (??), but changed other things so it's all mismatched. Music is now pop top 40 and reggaeton. Hash browns are generic fried potato chunks. Everything was so salty it was almost inedible.

I've gone twice, the first time we ordered a drink and app with our meal and my meal was $45, which the food is really good and I enjoy going and love the location, I don't know if it's worth that price. The second time, I tried one of their mocktails (super good by the way, all their cocktails and mocktails have their fruit juices artfully made and I'm pretty sure they're real juice in their drinks, or so I was told), the second time without an alcoholic drink it was $35 per person.

It's my go-to brunch dish and it's something I can never get enough of (if done well). Caf√© luna definitely won me over with the lobster eggs benedict. Not only was the presentation picture perfect, but everything on the place as cooked to perfection. The English muffins were toasted and not too soggy. The lobster meat was poached in butter and was so sweet 'n tender, even my non-lobster-loving boyfriend gave it a thumbs up. The eggs were perfectly poached so the whites were no longer translucent and the yolk still had a runny consistency. And last but not least, it was topped with the lightest hollandaise sauce I'd ever tasted. Yes, it's a little steep to pay $20 for benedict, but compared to many other places I've been to around the US, this was a very fair price to pay for the amount and quality of food I got. The boyfriend went for the lemon ricotta pancakes, another highly recommended dish as seen on Yelp. They were really light and fluffy, but definitely more sweet and desserty than what I would prefer for breakfast.

Today was no exception. Was looking for a dog friendly restaurant to celebrate my brother's birthday that could accommodate a lab. There is a large patio with several tables that was perfect. They even brought out a doggie water bowl for my brother's dog. She also enjoyed a little platter of rice. The patio was shaded when we were there around noon and the weather was perfect.Was there to celebrate my 26th anniversary and my brother's birthday. He drove 5 hours to meet us there and thoroughly enjoyed everything. One thing to note is that they don't offer any special complimentary treats for birthday celebrations like many other sushi restaurants we have been to (like a fried ice cream ball or cheesecake). However, the server suggested the fried oreos dessert which was perfect for sharing. We tried a few things that are not on the menu and we were not disappointed. I usually find out about the special items watching the Instagram food porn posts they put out. Today, we tried the flaming cheetos battered sushi hotdog, with spicy salmon instead of the standard spicy tuna. It comes with layered thinly sliced cucumbers and avocado, seaweed salad,  spicy crab salad, spicy mayo and masago. It was delicious and worth the $17. It was almost a foot long!We also tried the sushi crunch wrap supreme, not on the menu. You can't tell in the picture but this thing was massive! It was $40 but had enough stuff in it that I equated it to 3-4 regular rolls. It is very difficult to bite into due to the massive size and also difficult to slice through because of the seaweed salad slipping everywhere.  We shared half of it between 4 of us and took the other half home since we were all stuffed. The regular menu rolls are all much larger than most places and they accommodate special requests, like fish substitutions. They do not skimp on the amount of fish in the rolls. I believe most of their rolls can be served regular of tempura battered and fried.Our server was awesome and took care of everything we needed.

Usually places like these refill rice, but they didn't, and they usually refill water as well, which they also didn't. And they are not the kindest to people who are slow orderers. It's like they get annoyed when you've never been here and have to peruse the menu. As for the food, it's pretty good. I ordered: tripe in black bean sauce, roast pork belly, duck and veggie delight. I'd give their food a 3.75. I wish it was piping hot when it comes to the table, but everything was lukewarm as if it had been pre-made and was sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be brought out. The pork belly was a bit disappointing. It has some sort of a gamey aftertaste and the skin was a bit more tough and rubbery than crunchy.

Staff seems super friendly so I'm sure they would have figured something out to help me, but it's pretty disappointing to get a coffee and have it not be the proper temperature. I know it was 8pm and there's not a lot of black coffee being sold, so they probably hadn't brewed it in awhile. But a 24 hour coffee shop should be constantly brewing new coffee or using properly insulated containers, which I felt like it wasn't.I hope it's just an isolated incident, but I have a feeling if it's nighttime their coffee just won't be hot unless I happen to come in right after it's brewed.

She said I could have some if I insist but that they don't drink it and suggest a bottle of water instead. I accepted, but found it kind of frustrating. One friend ordered a glass of wine and another a coke, which came in a can. We ordered the baked mozzarella appetizer. It was fresh mozzarella in a tomato sauce with fresh basil. It came with little crostinis for dipping. I ordered the mac and cheese meatballs on top of the white bean ragu. The food came out quick! It came with 3 meatballs and also a side salad and little piece of focaccia. The owner is very friendly and wants to share something about each dish that comes out so be ready to pause your conversation when your food comes out. The salad was delicious! I'm not sure what dressing came on top, but it was sweet and salty and went perfectly with the arugula, corn, onion, and feta. The meatballs were great. I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese (or whatever it was) on top, which is weird because I loveeeee cheese. But that didn't stop me from eating the entire thing :) I do wish the focaccia was bigger!

It includes the fresh cooked lobster, mussels, clams, squid, shrimp all served in generous portions with the famous tomato wine sauce. This dish is meant to be shared with at least 2-3 people. We finished all of the seafood but the pasta leftover looked like another serving on its own. I highly recommend substituting for the squid ink pasta. it is so good and has lots of flavor with garlic all over. It was nice getting to see the chef cooking the dishes so close. The seafood is so fresh, you can catch a glimpse that some of the lobsters are still alive prior to it being chopped and cooked. The issue that I encountered initially is that the hours on yelp indicates they open at 11 a.m (Saturday visit), we got there 10 minutes prior and just waited with no one in line yet. A few minutes later, another group lined up. Someone opened the door and asked if they were open yet at 11 and they said they wouldn't be ready until 11:30 (Ran into some locals and they told us this is normal but well worth it) To kill time, the bf and I stopped at the Paul Revere house. We came back, they still weren't ready so we just waited until finally 10 minutes before 12 they opened. Inside has very limited seating (max 20ish) and everyone in the party has to be present to be seated. Don't come here expecting super friendly service. The waiter is blunt and efficient with taking your orders and bringing it to the table. We saw him telling a couple up front about how they can just leave if they aren't happy and it wont hurt his feelings. Just come for the food. It was the best meal I've had in awhile.

If the food was tested for sodium intake...I promise this place would be shut down. Must take food to go. There are seats inside, but only to wait for your order. So if you don't live close, this can be a challenge if you want hot crab legs. I got the shrimp plate due to not wanting to travel 30 mins home with crab legs.Messy. They really should double bag the food. I had so much salt/garlic grease at the bottom of my bag. I would have been very upset had it leaked in my car.Next, parking.

One that I'd recommend due to the uniqueness of the food. First thing you will notice is that Pok Pok is located on a road with very limited parking. The first thing you should do is drop someone off to place a name on the waiting list. The wait times here are insane, close to 1.5+ minimum during peak dinner times. Luckily, they do hold your spot via phone number so you're free to wander once you've made the list. Honestly, if you have things to do I would recommend just leaving and coming back instead of waiting around. The wait times are very accurate, don't count on getting a seat earlier than what is told. If you have yelp, it will tie your RSVP to it so hi can keep track of how many people are ahead of. Very nice and convenient. When you do decide to park, you'll have an easier time finding something in the neighborhoods. Menu here is overwhelming. I'd recommend looking up pictures or yelp suggestions, even asking the waiter instead of attempting to read it. What I appreciate is the food here, very unique and so different from anything I've ever had before. Portion sizes are small so you'll end up ordering a few dishes to fill your hunger. Prices are also quite high especially considering portion sizes but nothing too alarming. I ordered the Ike Chicken Wings and the Kung Op Wun Sen.

The staff is amazing, and seems to realize they have the \\"juice\\" at this place.The prices aren't aligned with the areas college student's check book balancing, however, it's a superb bait and switch they can take their parents to when they come visit. More plainly put, the prices won't break the bank, but don't forget your wallet.The Original Moonshine Corndog Shrimp (honey mustard, blueberry swirl) - oh my gosh! gigantic large shrimp dipped and coated in a thick pancake sweet batter, fried to a golden brown is absolutely wonderful.

This appetizer is served as a dish to share, but the taste coat your generosity with selfishness, therefore, I recommend everyone to order their own.\\n¬†¬†\\nMasher - there isn't a size that would be large enough to soothe my greed for this more mashed than whipped caloric vegetable.

On our recent trip to Orlando, Lineage made the list and I'm really glad it did. Its hidden away inside the East End Market (which is awesome in its own right), and it is very unique. First of all the decor is pretty sharp; its basically a stall in the market but they haven't let that detract from the cool, white and black decor they've installed. They also have some very original drinks. I tried the White Cold Brew; its their cold brew coffee with milk, vanilla, and some spices that comes served in a glass bottle (think beer bottle). Its cold, sweet and absolutely delicious. They also roast all their own beans (off site) so they freshness of all their drinks is perfect.They do pretty much have no seating nearby, and while the market itself has plenty of outdoor seating, you will need to carry your drinks there. Not really a big deal but it would be cool if they had a few stools or something. Their drink selection is a little limited, which makes complete sense given their size but don't go expecting a plethora of options.I really did enjoy Lineage and the Market overall.

I have tried the chicken, steak and ground beef variety, and both the steak and chicken were extremely disappointed. The guacamole on the side is nothing special. The flour tortillas taste packaged and certainly not homemade. The pico is also average, as well as the rice. Everything sort of tastes lackluster.

We also tried their crab, crispy pork belly, and bulgogi bao buns. Very good! My favorites were the crispy pork belly and the bulgogi, the best were very soft too. Our sushi rolls were great as well! They have some pretty creative rolls and many of them at that. We didn't spend too much time studying the menu because of so many options! We got the first two that stuck out to us and were pleased.

But it's in a very nice area in Avalon Park where I live. A simple in and out shop, but the quality of the food is top notch. Everything is homemade and using family recipes from the middle east. The owner Mamdu is from Egypt originally, but lived in NYC for decades. He is a really nice and hospitable man and you can tell right away he cares about his customers the way he interacts with them. And he was a former EPA agent, so you know the food is fresh and clean!The falafel is amazing. By far the best ive ever had and I have been around the world including the middle east. My clients from Iran and Iraq who visit me, I took them here and they were surprised how authentic the food was and they agreed with me, pretty badass falafel! I also enjoy the kabobs and kuftas, the rice is perfect, and you can always depend on the gyros.I made a suggesstion to Mamdu to get better filtered water for his machines. he didn't get upset or anything, he took suggesstion seriously, and the next week I came in he remembered me right away and told me he already contacted his distributor to improve the water.

I am not normally a fan of hotel restaurants, but One Bistro was an impressive spot within the Four Points by Sheraton hotel.  The restaurant was not overly crowded, but the bar was lively with most seats occupied when we arrived.Upon being seated in a comfortable booth, we decided against appetizers only due to the food coma coming out of Christmas, but did order entrees off their daily menu.  I had the swordfish which was advertised as a chef's specialty.  The portion size was perfect and the fish expertly grilled and flaky served on a roasted pumpkin puree that surprisingly complimented the dish without overpowering it.  The parmesan encrusted chicken was nicely presented and accompanied by parmesan and herb risotto and roasted baby vegetables in season which were served al dente.  Both dishes satisfied our appetites  and didn't leave room for dessert on this night.  Our waitress was professional, knowledgeable of the menu and wine list, and courteous which added to our pleasant night out.

There has been quite a few price hikes but they are super popular so seems justified. Sadly the food quality seems to have gone down a little but if they're still at max capacity every weekend I guess that's fine too haha. They have a lot of offerings, there's hibachi, sushi bar, sashimi bar, oysters, crab legs, cold food, cooked food, deep fried food, steamed food, ice cream, desserts, and a crepe bar. I love the hibachi because it has scallops and I always get four or five servings of it. It's not the best quality scallops but they're scallops and they're cooked fresh so I like them. Sushi bar has a lot of variety, I try to stick to maybe a rolls worth every meal because of the rice content. I like eating the razor clam, octopus, rainbow, and a couple other rolls that are more fish heavy. Sashimi I really load up on because I love sashimi and most worth. The supply is sometimes low but it's usually pretty well stocked. I believe it's salmon and tuna. The oysters are ok, when I went I was only able to load up my plate once because they go so fast. I douse it in lemon and sauce. There are also cooked oysters served cold which are actually really good because of the nice pepper sauce it has. I avoid the crabs legs because it is a waiting game to get them and they are messy to eat. The cooked food I kinda avoid but I get some chow mein, some steak, some shu mai and dumplings, a little bit of everything that interests me but in very small portions. Usually I think circle back to sashimi for round 2. I avoid the desserts because they are pretty meh and instead go for the crepes! The crepes are one of my favorite things there because their batter is delicious. I usually get two or three. You can choose between perserved fruit to put in and whipped cream and it's made fresh. There's usually a small line but the lady makes them three at a time so it's not a long wait. Ice cream is also meh. I would say the meal is worth the price.

A highlight of the night for sure with good fruit, wine and cordial balance.The meat and cheese board was ok. but the pieces are not cut for sharing for more than two. a bit of extra work but the flavor of the offerings were great. My mom really enjoyed the cheese. We ordered the meat skewer platter. TERRIBLE. Only one of the sausage cooked decently the other sausage disgustingly soggy. The chicken was COLD.  The steak was tender. Only meat worth putting in my mouth and one of the most expensive dishes. There was some type of sauce (sorta?) and it did nothing for the meat. We all were disappointed.Croqueta was great. Crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. They were  satisfying. Boyfriend was happy.Portabello mushroom stuffed with cheeses was very very good. We love mushrooms and my mom wanted a veggie option.We ordered the house ceviche because it well ,duh, we are at a place named ceviche. It was light and flavorful. Veggies crispy and selfish well marinated.We ordered an extra entree of escargot. I am torn about this dish. The snails were cooked lovely and the sauce was ok. It was served in prefrozen phyllo shells, like you buy in the frozen section in the store. That is unacceptable to me. Even when I make pigs in the blanket at home, I butter sheets of phyllo and cut them myself. They were also soggy from all the sauce. These could have been better if they just cared enough to try.I am pretty sure we had another dish I cannot remember, but that tells you about that. I would look at the menu online to jog my memory but ceviche's website is not properly loading...Service was kinda ok, but not really. Waters not refilled, etc. She was a bit absent. Her suggestions were some of our least favorite dishes but the most expensive on the menu... We did order desert, the bread pudding and the creme brulee. Both of which the table really liked. My sister didn't like the creme brulee as much as me, my mom and boyfriend but she did like that that is came with fresh fruit. I LOVED that the creme brulee was in its own dark chocolate cup. It was great. My boyfriend who always loves a good bread pudding really liked theirs and I agree it was good. Not too dry but not overly mushy.

Definitely very good quality. No BBQ sauce needed; that good. Ribs: seriously it just comes off the bone, and the flavor brings it all come together. It's definitely drool-worthy.Sausage: tasted a bit different than I'm used to. Not something I would die for, but not bad. Impression was that...it tasted like sausage and that's about it. Pulled pork: not sure if I just don't like pulled pork, but this wasn't at all on par with the brisket or ribs.

Let's face it: there are only 4 choices, so I thought all of them would be good.Overall, glad to scratch Franklin's off my bucket list of Austin at last!

Pro-tip: Get the pan con lechon with a side of maduros to add inside!So, this is all based on the fact that there is absolutely nothing else of any quality to eat at this terminal other than Zaza's. That makes me SUPER thankful this local brand is here. But why the caveat about the airport food? Because they have to quickly serve folks and get them off to their gate asap. That means the sandwiches are all pre-made and then pressed as you order them. Now, if this were in one of their regular locations, that would bum me out, but I totally get it in this circumstance and so I'm not mad about it at all. This also means you won't be able to customize the sandwiches. Again- no big deal. My recommendation (and go-to every time I fly through terminal B) is ordering the pan con lechon sandwich and a side of maduros. Then open the sandwich and cut up the maduros into that bad boy. I normally find pan con lechon a bit dry, so this adds moisture and some sweetness. I've also ordered their cuban toast, slathered in butter, which makes for a great, quick breakfast.

The quesitos (which we would die for at the other ZaZa's because they are so good) also were disappointing and felt more like leftovers as well. Granted, it's an airport location.

Barlow's themed bar of a classier, upscale, and sophistication for me is always a plus. I like these kind of places, even though it is on the pricier side, it is more relaxed. We did not sit at the bar, but at one of the round tables at the end. DRINKS: I got a Monet Fizz. There's not much to say, but I will say that with the drinks that my friends got, the drinks were not strong, but after one of the cocktails, you were feeling pretty good. I would say that people complain about the weak drinks; I personally found the drinks to be suitable for my tastes. Nothing too crazy or new, but I personally found it quite tasty. SERVICE: Nothing much to say. Our server was new to the area of Portland and probably this job. Friendly and did not bother us as we enjoyed our drinks and company. A good find in the Pearl District and seems to be a fairly new establishments. Perhaps on the steeper side for a drink, but the atmosphere is great.

One of the pieces was just a piece of fat as well... The flavor was strong but there was definitely too much salt.+ Neeua Nam Tok ($15.50): Spicy flank steak salad. This was just pieces of beef and cilantro. It was very flavorful and tangy! But although its description is that it's a salad, IT'S NOT. For $15.50, you'd expect a lot bigger of a portion as well.+ Coconut Ice Cream Sandwich ($7): This was interesting! It came in a piece of bread and truly was a sandwich. The sticky rice was yummy! The ice cream texture was a bit odd though.SERVICE - \\nWe were the first ones at the restaurant when it opened on a Sunday for lunch at 11:30am, and our server was the furthest thing from friendly.

The decor throughout is modern and very instagram friendly . We arrived on a week night and it was busy through the restaurant. We were seated promptly and had a wonderful server. It was still Happy Hour so our server shared about half priced drink specials and appetizers. They provided us with complimentary popcorn that was a really fun touch and tasty! We each chose a house wine and shared the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer. I have a gluten allergy so I wasn't able to enjoy the breading that comes traditionally on the FGT but enjoyed the tomatoes themselves and the dressing and shrimp they were served with. Once I shared with my server about my gluten allergy, she was great at walking me through the menu on what was naturally gluten free and what could be with modifications. I settled on the Backyard Chicken without a bun. Our food was served timely even though it was busy and was delicious. My burger also came with the sweet potato fries (cross contamination warning) and dipping sauce and they were delicious. The portion size for the fries was huge and I couldn't even finish.

My boyfriend pointed to a picture on the menu asking what it was, and the waiter said that they don't serve that and that it's only available through special request/catering (seemed a little odd they would place an image on the menu of something that isn't available to order). He was very nice though and tried to suggest other things. He gave us more time to look at the menu and finally came back about 10 minutes later when we motioned toward him.We then finally placed our orders. The food came over pretty quickly and was DELICIOUS. We got probably the best crab rangoon we have ever had. But then, nobody came to see how our food came out and we were waiting for about 20 minutes after we finished eating to get the check. It seemed a little bit ridiculous that the service was so incredible slow considering we were literally the only people in the restaurant. Maybe just an off night? Super weird.Also, when I go out for Chinese, I like to sample a bunch of different things and usually get a combination plate or something like it.

I came here with my boyfriend and sister on a Saturday and we all 3 left extremely satisfied and full.  I had the largest biscuit sandwich I have ever had.  The hashbrowns were delicious and are a must for all future visits. Service - B.  The lady at the counter was very helpful.  I just wish the staff would bring the food to the customers instead of having to pick it up from the counter.  My only reasoning is for the customers who sit around which is what my party did.  Perhaps something to think about... I am thrilled Maple Street Biscuit Company is a part of Oviedo.  I will be back, again and again."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I gave this place so many tries for lunch & breakfast.  You would really have to have low standards to like this place.  The food has no flavor.  They only have a couple of soups & sandwiches that are decent but not worth the price though.  Today, I decided to try their french toast.  It was not french toast.  It was like a heavy, sweet, disgusting cake.  I also can't stand the female manager.  Although she's weird & overbearingly nice with customers, she's very rude to her employees by reprimanding them in front of customers.  One time, she was helping me and then she just walked away from me to yell at one of the employees.

Shortly after I moved to Porter Square, and was delighted to find a Wings right nearby. Tonight I went down and ordered a DC-10 of Honey BBQ, and was looking forward to great wings covered in plenty of sauce. When i opened the container I noticed very little sauce on the wings themselves, which was confirmed when I took a few bites of my first wing. Needless to say the entire top row had no sauce at all, a major downside as Wings over Worcester has them dripping in sauce.I thought that maybe there had been a slightly mix up, and that they corrected themselves as the second row seemed darker and covered in some amount of sauce. However at the first bite I realized that they gave me buffalo wings, which while still good was not the BBQ style wings I was looking forward to (plus not the same without blue cheese, as I ordered ranch in anticipation of BBQ).This may have been a case of them being overwhelmed on a Saturday night, and will give them another chance to improve their score, but disappointed in my first visit to the local edition of a favored establishment"},{"name":"Bob Evans","address":"7411 W Irlo Bronson Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"Breakfast was breakfast.

I take it it's barbecue? I was there for Meltdown a couple years ago (Three 6 Mafia, et. al.), but was in the VIP section that overlooked the stage as a guest of the radio station. Thank God for that, it soooo wasn't my scene. Down there in the gravel amphitheatre? Not in Prada loafers. I met some guys that seemed to have been pulled straight from those old flash animations...Jake's Booty Call, or something like that. They were white, honestly thought they were ballers, and loudly trolled for booty all night. I met one new person who saved herself in my phone as \\"Hot Shandi\\". I'll take her word on it. I recall being there for Bobaritaville (last year?); again VIP with the radio station. I don't know who won, but I sampled them all. I was a Friend of Bob, and eventually a friend of everyone by the end of that event. As I recall, I hated the gravel then too. Maybe I'm the idiot for wearing Fendi sneakers when I know it's a rock heap. So basically, my frame of reference for this place is the wood patio upstairs that's cordoned off for concerts, and the menu is Miller Lite and watered down rum and diets I use drink tickets to buy.

They were one of the first real bars to come down to the Slaughter area, and I am giving them a star for starting the process because now they are starting to get lost in the flood of south Austin spots to watch a game.Little Woodrows has an excellent beer selection, with several differently themed weeknight specials which are a good deal if you like beer and cheap food.  They have wine of so so quality, where I'd like it better if they knocked about a buck off of the glass price as they are nearing the mark where one glass costs about as much as a bottle of the stuff is retail.  They also don't offer wine by the bottle which is unfortunate when you're lovely wife hates beer and you are there for 4 hours for a football game.There's no hard liquor to be found anywhere at Little Woodrows, which stinks for the early games where a bloody mary always hits the spot.  The menu has recently been modifed where pizza is no longer an option, which I doubt anyone cares about as it was pretty gross anyway.They have ample seating indoor and out with lots of electronic games along with washers set up in the back.  With two other sports bars located in Southpark Meadows, I would assume that a table will be easier to come by than it used to be.

My wife and I went to the grand opening with 3 other couples. Our experience was outstanding.From the moment you walk into the intimate space, you know its going to be a nice evening. Smells of truffle and bacon from the exposed kitchen waft out over the rustic hardwood floors, past the classic, dark wood bar, all the way to the gorgeous curtains on the far end of restaurant that hang in front of huge french doors that look like they can open in the summertime. Even though it is a smaller space, it doesn't feel crowded, and the ambiance soothing, much more restrained than some of the other boutique Portland restaurant we've been to. Cocktails were outstanding. I had the Abby (gin, lillet blanc, Truth) which was delish, and my wife had a bourbon drink, whose name has escaped me, but after I pried it from her clutches, I understood why she was coveting it so. It smelled sweet, like high quality (antica formula, maybe?) sweet vermouth and orange peels, but it tasted firm, almost had a leather smell, maybe. The balance in that drink was impressive. It was my wife's favorite thing of the evening.We moved on to small plates; there was an impressive selection to choose from. We opted for the sweetbreads and the clams. The sweetbreads were easily the best I've ever had. By a mile. They came with a luscious, luscious piece of pork belly and cauliflower. The clams were endowed with a surprise: bacon, smoked as I recall. Anyway, the clams were great and an excellent dipping option for the bread. Now, the bread and butter is on the small plates menu for $3. ($3 for bread? unusual, I thought.) Then I realized why it was $3: the butters. The glorious flavored butters were anchovy, a two other awesome flavors, presented beautifully on the plate and perfect for spreading (don't you hate it when you are at a nice restaurant and the butter is rock hard? yeah, I do too.  what am I supposed to do with this?). After tasting the butters, I sort of felt like I had stollen them. Who in their right mind would part with this butter, at any price?BISON TIME! That is what I'm talking about! I will devour this great beast, and I too will roam the praires of North Portland! Paired with this wonderful potato creation and kale, the bison was cooked to perfection. By this time, I've entered a sort of delirium (I think it was the sweetbreads) and our friends at our table are beginning to realize that their dinners are not safe. I'm shamelessly begging, like a crack addict, for a taste of whatever delight that they have in front of them. I tasted the halibut, the chicken, and the gnocchi. After tasting the halibut, I realized one of Cocotte's greatest strengths: the chefs let the ingredients shine for themselves. Nothing was over salted or over oiled. It was just fresh, delicate halibut in combination with other wonderful flavors. I understood my potato treat in a new way after tasting the halibut. The favors were right up front. The chicken was melt in your mouth amazing, and the gnocchi top notch. Like a good french restaurant, Cocotte has a fine list of mostly French wine, but a good number of local, boutique wines too. At our table, we had the Tillie Claret (made in Neuberg with grapes from Oregon and Washington) and the '06 (I believe) Fleurie, which is a Beaujolais cru from east-central France. Pinot fans will love the Fleurie, which is a similar varietal, but not the same. Both wines were fruity and easy drinking low tannic wines. Both were characteristic of the types of wines on the menu: small production, and high quality. Good range of prices too. Chocolate pot de creme for dessert with almond whipped cream. So good. I have no idea how they made that almond whipped cream so light and flavorful, but it steals the show. I remember plotting a raid on my neighbor's oatmeal cake, but I was so focused on my pot de creme that I missed my chance. Next time. One last thing worth mentioning: the bathroom is stunning. It became a topic of conversation at our table. At one point, someone said, \\"I want my entire house to look like that bathroom.\\" That might be hyping it up too much, but it is perfectly appointed in classy, Cocotte style.To describe Cocotte holistically, the food, the atmosphere, the cocktails, etc., she is balanced, but with sophisticated feminine touch. Attractive and delicious, seemingly, without even trying, which only makes me want her more."},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Usually visit on a Tuesday  or Sunday night, but I've been nearly every night of the week.

My friend, a local SE'er, said this is the best brunch place, especially for what I was craving.  And it was.  I had the orange ricotta griddlecakes and ordered an egg and the chicken apple sausage on the side.  The grub really hit the spot.  I then reached over the next plate-- my boyfriend's-- and tasted his beef hash.  It was so savory and delicious. Fyi, that if you order the chicken and waffle, you are ordering A chicken and waffle.  There is one waffle and then three huge chicken breasts on top of a waffle.  You really will be getting a chicken.Great service, location, and ah-mazing food.  TIP:\\nOf all the places we visited in Portland, this was the only one that had the wait. Because we were ok with sitting outside on a 80+ degree day, we were able to get seated right away.  However, although we arrived less than an hour to closing time, there were about three or four parties still waiting.

Hmph. Gr. Wah. The fried rabbit was coated in so much panko that I couldn't even tell if it was rabbit or chicken in the middle, & it didn't really matter because it was really just an underwhelming, somehow nondescript flavor. The blue cheese, apple, celery, radish & chili oil surrounding it unfortunately still didn't make the dish a success.I'm glad I ordered 2 dishes (as recommended) because they were so small, but my friend ordered pasta carbonara & it ended up being so much food that she couldn't even finish it (luckily she didn't order a side, despite being sneakily encouraged to by our waiter).So it wasn't a bad meal by any means, but for the price?

And don't expect any more seating than the picnic tables on the side of the building. However, do expect to chat with frequent customers about the tasty sandwiches while waiting in the unaired-conditioned store. Do keep it simple and order the classic Cuban, nothing else is as good. Make sure you ask for extra napkins (the traditional mojo sauce leaks out the bread and I've made messes of myself). If you are a girl, flirt back with the owner, he's just a sweet old man who likes to make people smile. Practice your Spanish by exclaiming \\"muchas gracias\\" while walking out the door.

All of the dips here are solid - guac and queso are perfect, and you get a basket of homemade chips with free refills. If you get chips and a fancy shell, you probably don't need more than one taco.

In my mind, this is the only time the margaritas are really worth it, as they aren't very strong. The flavors are fun though. This is in the bar area only, so be prepared to share a bunch of high top tables with your new best friends.

My boyfriend and I sat at a high top bar table on a Tuesday night and it was very quiet. There were a few other people in the bar, but the emptiness did not bother me much because the bartender was attentive and fun to chat with. I wasn't sure what to order to drink and the bartender described the beers on tap perfectly and recommended a beer to me which I really enjoyed. As for tapas, we decided to start with Chicken Taquitos which were good but very small for the price. We also ordered the nachos, which were both amazing and a huge portion.  I would definitely recommend those to anyone! For entrees, we decided to get tacos and split the carne asada tacos and the crispy fish tacos. The carne asada were absolutely fabulous! There were 2 tacos per plate, but they were very full with meat and the meat was marinated well. I give this place 4 stars for the attentive service and good experiences for both brunch and tapas/drinks.

The steak was grilled, seasoned well and was like butter - it was THAT tender.  Fries were excellent.  Hot and crispy.Grilled pork chop - tasty.  Not as tender as the steak but you can't compare something like that.  It's like apples and oranges.Tart tatin - not overly sweet and carmelized soft. Very well done.If there was any complaint I would have, it would be the noise level.

I went up to the counter to ask for a little more gravy and VN proceeded to say \\"Sure!\\" then handed me a salad dressing to go cup (tiny) full of gravy (2 TBS?) and said \\"here you go-that'll be 60 cents please.\\" Wow.

I can see why they did this - probably the most intimate table in the place. But it just felt like we were jammed in a corner.I have to admit that I was a bit overwhelmed by the wine list, but that's a 'me' thing, not them. And our server did a decent job of steering us to a bottle we both enjoyed.The dishes were good-to-very good, though not stellar... one or two dishes were served lukewarm (like the skirt steak, which is definitely NOT meant to be served lukewarm).What really put me over the top was the horrendous music - I know, it sounds petty but it really matters. They were playing 70s classic rock, which is OK (it wasn't very loud) but then, out of nowhere, they shifted to cheesy pop music at a seemingly louder volume, making it much more difficult to talk. Why restaurants feel the need to destroy the groove they're going for with amateur music choices is beyond me...They DID offer us a very nice dessert plate w/ a candle at the end, which was very cool of them (and it was very good). But, at that point, we were just chomping at the bit to get out of there.Perfect place for casual drinks and an appetizer - don't go there for a meal.P.S. - it's worth pointing out that the staff was very nice; none of my gripes are due to poor service - strictly mood and food preparedness."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So good!

The first time was fine: drinks and cheese dip on the patio. Second time, OK food in the main room. This time, a mixture of good and bad. Service was (for the most part) good, mostly because of the eye candy. The host girls (all 4 of them) have a way of making you feel like you're interrupting their gossip, and wouldn't be caught dead smiling. Beer was cold; that's good. Guac and veggie tacos were really good. Chicken tacos were overly soupy, and to be honest, just not very flavorful. Pork tamale was not so good, in that way that Mexican-for-the-masses places tend to make them. But the big no-way of the evening was the steak enchilada. The mole was a 6-year-old's idea of sauce--Hershey's syrup sweet, with no hint of smoky spicing that should have been there. And it turns out, their idea of steak in the enchilada is ground beef. WTF? Our otherwise-nice waiter said there must have been a communication problem. Um, yeah, like maybe the restaurant lies about what's actually in their food? What other explanation is there, considering there are no ground beef enchiladas on the menu? It might seem like a small thing, but for some reason we prefer to not be treated like chumps -- so we'll go elsewhere in the future.

There were a ton of people, and we had to wait around 20 minutes, which sucked, but they gave us a buzzer thing and we made a pit stop at Starbucks across the street.  What also sucked was that when they finally did seat us, they put our party of five at a square table meant for, hey, squares have four pretty non-negotiable sides, so four.  I got stuck at a corner, but it worked out okay since I didn't have a plate.  Anyway, though, Border Cafe was hopping and seems to be a sort of hub for students, or at least I ran into a ton of people I knew in the couple hours I was there.  We sat downstairs and it was cozy, which was great because Cambridge was about as warm as an igloo on the moon.It was comfortable enough in there that I felt compelled to swallow three fruity margaritas, two in frozen form.  Our server (who, by the way, beer goggles aside, was whoa cute) recommended the raspberry, so I ordered that first.  It was definitely good, but the strawberry I ordered next was much better.  I would've ordered another, but decided last minute to go with the melon, which cute server said was better on the rocks.

The employees were great about keeping my rowdy 4 and 5 year old nephew and niece cool and occupied. But even after being told we were lucky that this was a short line - as school had not started yet - we still waited just shy of 3 hours. It was hot like mid to high 90s, and the fact that you just feel dirty and sweaty by the time you get into the place which is brimming full of people inside and out. It's just too much of an ordeal for that great bbq. The meat - ribs, pulled pork, brisket, sausage is delicious. We weren't feeling the potato salad but wish we had gotten more slaw. Their brisket is delicious, I don't need sauce. His meats are prepared simply how I like my bbq. But if I had to stand in line again, not so much.

It seems each new street taco place I find, the more impressed I am with the food up here.Quesabrosa is no different. The only surprise, I didn't see lengua on the menu. It's become a staple for me when I get tacos, but alas no lengua for me on this day. Beef and pork were welcome and tasty options. The green salsa had quite a bit of lime to it but not as much spice as I had hoped. Both meats were great, not really spicy but moist and right on point. I really liked the soft tacos themselves. Homemade and really good.Gotta love good food when you're not necessarily looking for it.Enjoy."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great Seafood place!

The fried chicken was amazing - the flavor was incredible - pairing gluttonously well with the biscuits and gravy. The fried oysters were fresh and tasty, and the breading out of this world. The brisket was well cooked, but was outshined by the mac and cheese. The best side? The pecan crusted, candied bacon. So. Good.

The macaroni and cheese wasn't the traditional Southern dish I'm accustomed to. Elbow noodles weren't used and the cheese sauce was lacking in the taste department. Soul Fire's twist on macaroni and cheese didn't satisfy my appetite. The collard greens were TOUGH and a tad bit too sweet.

Plus the price was right, $7.95 for coffee or tea, an appetizer, and an entr√©e!The bartender, Danny, was very friendly and had a glass of water for me without me even asking.  I ended up with another bartender making my drink, the bloody mary.  It says on the menu that it is Ketel 1, mix, and a pickled jalapeno.  She made it with Tito's and a lemon and lime.   I asked her to remake it and she seemed a little disappointed but explained that she was new and that's how she was trained.  In any event, it was delicious!  Too bad it comes in a tiny glass with lots of ice.  The actual brunch portion of the meal was a comedy of errors.  The waiter kept dropping things, including once on me.  The food took forever to come.  And when it did, my friend's food was cold.  So they ran in and got someone else's dish thinking it was the same thing, but it had avocados, which my friend thought was welcomed surprise.  My food was good.   The huevos rancheros were filling and delicious.  The banana empanada hit the spot and had a yam sort of taste.

I also got the side of grilled veggies. They just tasted so weird I can even describe it.  It was just \\"off\\".  I'm also not a fan of the chicken ribs.  The saving grace for them is my buddy ordered the burger made with the same meat as mine, and he LOVED it.

I decided to have my birthday dinner at this place because it was something different. I read all the terrible reviews on facebook and Yelp and decided to still check it out. Terrible idea! The first issue was the slippery floors. Not exactly sure why but everyone in my party that was wearing heels almost fell. Second my reservation was for 8. 5 additional people showed up which was fine with the waiter at first (didn't catch his name) he moved two tables over and my guest joined our table. 5 mins go by he comes back and tells the table we cannot have the table due to the sugar factory being \\"over booked\\" and the table  being reserved for another party. He offered to have me speak to a manager because the rest of my party was already sitting down. This young man comes up without introducing himself and says sorry guys we have to take the table because we are over booked. One of my friends asked where the people were going to go that was sitting there? His response was there is a 2 hour wait, they can go to the bar or we could all leave.  He decided it was ok to raise his voice at my party about the table and took  them while my party was sitting down. Ask for another manager and a more reasonable one shows up and listened to the issues we were having. He said he would see what could be done and comes back and tells me the same thing. In the meantime my brother and sister in law leave and two of my friends went to sit at the bar. Finally a 3rd manager comes apologizing about what happened asked for me to call my brother to come back while moving the tables back over. He offered to buy his drinks and give my table the King Kong sundae. This place has a lot of work to do! Venue is very small. Loud music plays randomly. Not to mention for some reason managers were out in full force the whole night at different tables with customers arguing. Never again. Goblets were ok. Also one of my friends ordered shots for the whole table and was told he had to go over to the bar to order them. He goes to the bar and the bartenders have no idea how to make the shot or how much to charge him. Lol is all I can do at this point. Happy 24th bday to me!

For example, a horchata margarita. A beautiful blend of everything awesome in life (yes, I mean high quality tequila), plus extra points for authentic horchata with cinnamon, this drink was not something I would have ever conceived as delectable, but holy cow, party in my mouth!!Make no mistake-- I love me some tequila. So perhaps that is why this place has been an amazing find that no one seems to know about.  Service is always consistent and polite, and I love chatting with the bartenders in my horrible Spanish.

The samosas were banging.  I felt like this meal was on the right track!  I looked in my bag and wondered whether or not they had forgotten to pack an extra rice since I ordered two main dishes.  Whatever, I can make the rice last for both dishes.  I found the naan to be underwhelming.  It was a little rubbery and tough.  There wasn't much to the taste.  The tikka masala had a nice creaminess to it, but some of the pieces of chicken were dry.  That didn't stop me from eating the whole thing, but it took away from it.

This menu is definitely not tailored for women. They didn't even have fresh tomatoes as a \\"build your own\\" option. After we got our drinks, it was 20 minutes before she came by to take our order. The green bean fries smelled so awful I had to push them to the other side of the table.We waited approximately 40 minutes to get our food. In the interim, we could see others around us looking around for their server staff. It seemed like the staff would come out and then disappear for long periods of time in the back. The bison burger was OK, the regular cheeseburger was nothing significant and the blackened chicken salad had regular grilled chicken, no blackening or flavor. It took another 20 minutes to get drink refills and then we had to beg the manager to get our ticket so we could leave. We never saw our waitress again after our food was delivered.Overall poor service (although I did see the manager running around making apologies and trying to expedite food and drink orders). The staff disappears for long periods of time, they made no drink or food recommendations, and took too long to greet us. The whole ordeal took over 1 1/2 hours, and it not a very cozy atmosphere.

None of the places I order from would dream of incorporating these sorts of premium toppings. And wait, a 12\\" pizza for 6.99 with ANY amount of toppings? I'm used to settling for two to five generic toppings, and paying out the ass if I want to have a fully loaded pie. Not only that, but pesto sauce is available? Could it be? An actually real pizza place? In my neighborhood? And, wait, what's this? You can load up the salads till your heart's content as well? We ordered it, took average time to get here. The driver was surprisingly jovial, especially in comparison to drivers from the pizza chains. I suspect their business ethics are pretty solid if they can afford to sell quality pies at a lower-than-Dominos price and still employ drivers who aren't visibly upset on their delivery routes. But it could be a fluke. But no, each time our driver has been genuinely kind and laid back. Of course, I'm just speculating here on their ethics, but my first impression is that this is a good business.Our first pies were the slightest bit stale in the crust, I assume because we ordered during peak hours. Definitely excusable considering the drivers' routes are longer at that point. Ordering near closing time yields a fresh, crispy crust. They don't even skimp a tiny bit on the toppings, they're practically falling off of the pizza if you order enough. They stuff the salad to the brim and the house dressing is a nice tangy vinaigrette. I moved back to Austin maybe a year and a half ago. This is the first pizza place I've found that actually deserves to bear the title. The food is delicious, fills me up with considerably less food (I'll eat maybe four slices of chain pizza and a few breadsticks before I feel sated, but I can eat 1 or 2 slices of Mi Pizza, have a bite or two of salad, and be genuinely full for the next few hours), and is gentle on my all-too-sensitive GI tract. And for those sensitive to gluten, they offer a gluten free crust (which I have yet to try) - certainly a plus. Now I can enjoy pizza with my gluten intolerant friends, instead of pigging out in front of them saying \\"I wish you could have some, but...\\"Until I find some higher quality Vietnamese, or Indian food in my area, this may be the only place I order from for a while...Freaking legit.EDIT: I would like to note that the delivery fee of $4.00 is quite steep, especially if it's not going to the driver, and I suspect it's not as is usually the case. Not to mention that drivers and servers are hardly ever paid much more than $2 an hour in most cases. If it IS going to the driver, please let me know, so I'm not tipping 50%...it's not that I wouldn't like to, I'm just not exactly made out of money. But I assert my previous claims. Quality food.\\nEDIT: Today (April 6) I made an order of two pizzas, a salad, a 2-liter, and a cheesecake. They forgot to include my salad, and when the driver returned to bring it to me he also handed me two additional cheesecakes. I was like, holy shit, are you cereal? That is fuckin dope. Thanks guys."},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is the first time I came here for dinner. We came for the wine tasting & dinner night. This included a 5 course meal with wine pairings and dessert with a muscata wine. The night started with a Sauvignon Blanc with pate. I'm not a big fan of whites but this was pretty good and the pate although small was excellent. The next selection included salmon belly paired with a Chardonnay. I didn't care much for the Chardonnay but the salmon belly was good. The third course included a Spanish Tinto (a wonderful red) that came with a small plate of pepper paste on top of spring onions. It was barely a mouthful but delicious. The fourth course was pork belly (fantastic if you are like me and don't mind the fat) paired with a Shiraz (excellent). The fifth and final course included beef on top of wonderful potatoes with herbs. I liked it very much. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy the Cabernet that came with it because by that time I had reached my wine limit :). Then came dessert which was a very interesting shortbread cookie with strawberries and a cream cheese mousse. It was surprisingly good. I didn't mind the muscat pairing with it, but I'd have much preferred a sweet Moscato with it. All in all a great meal.

Of course what makes Kung Fu so much fun is the games. Some of them don't work, some of them do. We usually end up on the shuffle board since there is usually a large group of us. I liked it better inside because outside it's right up against the doors and people hit you sometimes...but it's still cool. They also have the Tabbed Out system with Iphones which I think is pretty cool. It's a pretty hip little place. Nice bathrooms too!

I'm not normally a fan of fish ceviche, I prefer squid/octopus/shellfish, but the flavor was so interesting it worked perfectly.

I've tried a couple of different ramen from different restaurants in Houston and this experience was the best. As I pulled up and I already saw the line going out the door, I expected the line therefore I was willing to wait. I probably had atleast 15-20 people ahead of me so you would think that the wait would take a long time. But, it didn't, I probably waited for about 20 mins. The place is incredibly small so it comes to a surprise that they get the patrons in and out. The place isn't like a normal restaurant, you go up to the cashier and get a number then they bring out the food out to you. My boyfriend and I tried the original and miso hot ramen and also the katsu sliders. The katsu sliders were soooo good. I literally ate it in one bite. But, the ramen is so delicious, the broth was so tasty and it had a creamy texture to it. I'd usually prefer my ramen to have a thicker creamy base then the usual watery base. I finished everything and I usually never finish my food. It was so good that right after we left I wanted to come back.

I had been wanting to try chicken'n'waffles for some time and my friend suggested Screen Door, even though neither of us had been there before. We got there at 12 on Sunday and were told the wait would be at least an hour and a half for a table for two. Okay. We left and walked around Burnside, checked out local shops and farted around for an hour, not a big deal. We were seated at 1:20pm, so actually less time than expected. Still, yes, it is a long wait. But when in good company it goes by fast. We both ordered chicken and waffles and the praline bacon. Soooo good! I will warn, however, that the portion is HUGE. I literally ate 1/4 of my waffle and once piece of chicken. That left me with two giant pieces of delicious chicken and over half of the yummy waffle. This place is very 'Portlandia' and the food stands up to all the reviews. Plus, for the quality and quantity of the food, it is relatively cheap. I've been to a few well known Portland restaurants known for insanely long wait times. Most of them are so cramped you are inches away from other diners and make you feel rushed to eat and run. Screen door creates a casual and- dare I say- relaxed vibe throughout the chaos around. We never once felt rushed or crowded, even though the place was packed, noisy and staff was dancing around the building. Out waiter was super personable, friendly, and attentive.

Being on a relatively tight timeline (we had to be gone in an hour, as in fed, paid, done) we made sure to ask the waiter if this was possible. Reinforcing that we had to be walking out the door in an hour or less, he said this was not a problem. After quickly looking at the menu we each ordered relatively simple dishes (nothing that would take a long time to make - that would be unfair given the timeline). Minutes passed, then ten minutes, then fifteen. Around this time is when you usually see something from the kitchen, as it was not a busy night (us and about three other tables). Another ten minutes passed, and I asked the waiter when we could expect our food. \\"It's coming right out\\". Annnddd another twenty minutes go by. Forty five minutes (as in almost an hour) after ordering, our food arrived. I couldn't believe it. It took at least five minutes for us to order, so that meant we were around the 55 minute mark - five minutes isn't enough to eat a meal. We had to get it packed up, which took the remaining five minutes. All in all, we essentially sat for an hour in a restaurant to order take-out. I made sure at the outset to mention our timeline. I asked several times how things were going. I feel that I was lied to. \\"Coming right out\\" doesn't mean twenty minutes. I've had Bombay take-out before and it was always great. The quality of the food is always high. It's unfortunate that this experience has soured my view of the restaurant's service. I'd recommend doing take-out only."},{"name":"Soul Fire BBQ","address":"182 Harvard Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Been wanting to get in here for such a long time!

The herb covered toast it came with was perfect for scooping sauce.The crispy pork belly was also very good, perfect crispy skin and super tender meat. The grits it came with were a little bland, but a good dish.The hallumi was a pretty good snack sized dish, but could have used more salt, more pickled onions, or a sauce.The parsnips were very underwhelming and bland, I was excited for the chicken skin but it was crumbled (on purpose) and ended up just tasting like burnt crumbs.Overall we really enjoyed our dining experience and will be going again to see what else they have, we will get the clams again!"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Awesome place to eat.

The sauce, which is supposed to be a white wine broth, was very heavy but did not contribute much towards flavouring the dish.Grilled Humboldt squid + pepperoni ragu + potato puree + croquette: This was THE highlight of the night.

The cheese grits were surprisingly perfect, and was like eating a meal made by grandma. The meal also came with 2 eggs and a biscuit. The tails were left on the shrimp, that drives me bonkers.

(My last was three years and four days ago.) Sure, why not? Today I tried their portabello sandwich. Not bad. Granted, it's a pretty simple product, so they can't damage or improve it too easily...a big mushroom, lettuce, tomato, and some kind of sauce on a bun. A fine lunch--not hearty, but enough, and not bad for $4.00. Next time I'll have to try the grilled chicken sandwich, which is only $3.00.It's a decent enough space to eat, especially on a rainy day when you don't want to see what it's like outside (it's inside the Garage, away from any windows). Though the location brings back wonderful memories that almost prejudice me against Flat Patties. The previous tenant in this location was Formaggio, makers of the best sandwiches in Harvard Square, if not the world.

Whatever you get on your plate, they'll charge you according to the weight.  This place is more heavily focused on meat.  So if you're into lots of meat, then this is your place to go.

After going through some House of Cards in preparation for the new season, I got a hankering for some ribs. I don't mean those ribs from the chinese place. I wanted some real southern ribs.  I decided to take on soulfire as a trial. Seriously. If you like southern food (real southern food) or bbq, try this place. You're missing out. Food: unbelievable. Couldn't give a better compliment. Ribs are top notch. Cornbread. Fries. Mac and cheese. Cole slaw. You can't go wrong. Service: no clue. I ordered delivery. But it came pretty quick (maybe 20-30 min?).Overall: amazing. Hands down the best southern joint up in the north. And also, for this price, you can't go wrong.

If you're looking for something really tasty and intensely filling for under $10 at lunch time you can't do much better than Grounds for Appeal, the unassuming cafe in the Law Society building that makes great curry and a solid chai.Personally, I don't care for the Butter Chicken (always find it on the dry side) but almost exclusively get the meat special of the day which usually cycles between badami chicken korma, tikka masala and karahi chicken and combo it with one of the two vegetable specials of the day. Every curry comes with a generous portion of rice and a piece of naan making the combo's easily stretch to two meals depending on your appetite. Portion aside the curry is consistently delicious and rich, just a nice touch of spiciness.I really recommend you give it a shot or at least the chai.

Suckas!There is certainly fresh fish here -- my favorite being the toro -- with large portions to be had as well. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs that night as we ordered miso soup, agedashi tofu, assorted sashimi, a spicy scallop roll, AND Asahi beer for the meal.

I agree with other reviews- the doorman was the best part of the night. My boyfriend and I quickly declined any cocktails due to an underwhelming menu and over priced options. I realize now that we should have snapped some photos of how ridiculous our dishes were.To clarify- I am a former chef, so I'm not your average bitchy customer looking for a free dish or someone ranting about food items they don't know. We ordered the chicken liver mousse- something I've made often and it came in a creme brulee dish covered in small slices of bread, 2 piles of whole grain mustard and 3 grapes that had been cut in half. You could not even see the chicken liver mousse, buried under this crap. And, no big surprise it here was a smear of the mousse on the side/bottom of the dish and I kid you not it tasted like cheezits. I have no idea how you make a mousse taste like that but it was terrible. We sent it back due to the ridiculous portion size and the server brought it back with a tiny bit more mousse in it and blamed the previous portion size on a new line cook-very professional of her. We ordered 4 cheeses from the dessert menu and only got three- and a parmigiano reggiano came as a piece with mostly rind. The marinated anchovies tasted like pledge and came draped over slice bread-all 7 of them- that's a 7$ dish right there.Overall a very disappointing night for a place that appeared as a cool speakeasy/culinary program/concept.

The service is the reason for this rating.

After eating and waiting another 15 minutes to pay and get out, it had become quite an investment of time.  Our server was in the weeds big time; I could tell he had about 6 other tables.  So at first I felt bad for him, as a lot of this obviously isn't his fault.  But then we saw him throughout the night socializing and standing around rather than asking if things were okay, so I lost that sympathy for him.  Plus, he just seemed annoyed to even have to be working.  No, I don't expect people to be happy to be serving me food, nor do I want cheeriness and sunshine.  But a minimum level of attentiveness isn't an unreasonable expectation.  The food was okay.  Your typical bar food; nothing amazing but certainly not the reason for this review.  The home brewed ale was also good.  But the servers, bartenders, and kitchen were all so obviously ill-prepared for a typically busy crowd (the seats were full, but it was hardly jam packed), and the place seemed so utterly disheveled and unorganized, that it had to be indicative of poor management.

My brother gave me 5 pounds of meat from here for my birthday. Best birthday present ever. I had a failed attempt to try the bbq manna when I went one early morning in July. I thought all the students would be gone, and the line would be, oh, about 30 minutes. I brought a book. I waited about 10 minutes at the end of a 50-person line when a dude came out selling bottled water and telling everyone it would be a 2-hour wait if they were in the last third of the line. I went to the front of the line and asked the people when they got there (it was currently 9:30 and the place opened at 10:00). They said they had been there since 6:00 AM. Oh mi gato! I left. We devoured the ribs, chicken, brisket, pork and other amazing tidbits involved in the package. (I liked the briskey the best.) We had the cole slaw and the potato salad. We had our bbq marathon that lasted for days, and caused us to stay in the house and become temporary hermits, not eager to share a morsel. And then it was gone. I have no idea when I will see it again but it was a four-day bbq feast that I will remember forever, as will my angry colon. There are over 800 reviews so I won't go into all the details, but I will share my hot tip. I was told last Sunday that if you purchase more than 5 pounds of meat and order ahead of time, you can go straight to the window. There you go. I haven't tested it yet, since a celebration of sorts would have to be planned, but it might be a good way to get a group of friends together and then you can just sashay right up to the window."},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Simply a beautiful and hip place to eat and enjoy the downtown view. Unique architecture and relaxing fountains are but a few highlights to this place. Plentiful parking as close as across the street (pay garage) make it safe and easy to visit. Facilities are modern, clean and full of natural daylight thanks to floor to ceiling panoramic windows. Dining space is good size and tables aren't too cramped together. Can accommodate larger parties. Full bar is beautiful and can seat about 20 or so.  I'm guessing it's spectacular at night with downtown lights but that will be our next visit. Service is very good and servers are pleasant and attentive without hovering. Menu is quite varied and features a few stunners that seem to be Yelper favs. Went with our son and his wife. I got shrimp and grits. Respectable portion. Shrimp are very large and cooked perfectly. Andouille sausage was amazing and cheddar grits just sinful. Son had brisket Philly that looked and smelled great. Big sandwich too. Daughter in law had cream cheese and lox pizza. It was enormous and packed with toppings. Wife had 3 Little Pigs sandwich which is brisket, bacon and pulled pork topped with house slaw and pickle. Again, large sandwich she enjoyed half of before getting full. Three of us had Bloody Mary's all of which were fantastic made with very premium ingredients. Desert was Classic cream br√ªl√©e. Really good as well.

I also sampled the shrimp wonton and the stuffed Calamari that my husband had, and wow, they were delectable! and the fresh spring rolls ..with the cilantro, are delicious. The green curry had excellent flavor.. the veggies were not soggy, with just a bite of crunch to them. Menu is pretty extensive , and yes...the food is excellent, the curries are wonderful, the  presentation is pleasant.

They had a very unofficial sign printed stating they were not participating in $1 drinks.  We ordered our food and a couple beverages regardless.  When I asked for a couple medium waters, I was told they were something like $.50 each.  For water?  When I am already spending $20 on food?  I can even try to understand putting a price on water to keep undesirables from lingering for free water.  But when someone is ordering a bunch of food, just give them the water as a courtesy!

Shuttled to the hotel, flung my suitcase in the room, fired up Google Maps, and hoofed it the almost-a-mile to the Church of the Holy Franklin Brisket, aka Franklin Barbecue.The line for this place is legendary. People have grown old on this line. They've paid off 30 year mortgages on this line. They've grown massive hipster beards on this line. When I got there (at around 12:30pm on a Sunday), there was a line ... but I was in the door within 10 minutes. Within 45 minutes, I was at the counter. The Baron of Brisket (the guy slicing and serving the awesome) had just pulled a new hunk of beefy splendor from the holding oven. He sliced off the burnt ends - have I mentioned that I am CRAZY for brisket burnt ends? - and, after slicing them into bite sized pieces, he laid them on some butcher paper, and then ... laid them on the counter in front of me.I snagged the burnt-iest end, popped it in my mouth ... and I heard angels singing Willie Nelson's \\"Crazy\\" as that burnt end melted in my mouth.I ordered half a pound of brisket, some cole slaw and potato salad, a can of Tejas lager, said \\"who needs it?\\" to the bread, and plunked down at a table with some strangers to make moaning and purring noises over the meltingly tender and delicious slices of beefy beauty.When it comes to the brisket at Franklin ... son, I *believe*."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We didn't even feel rushed to choose despite the number of people in the room. We finally decided to go with the pork crepinettes (fairly new on the menu we were told) and the smoked pork chops with green beans and potatoes. Yum yum! Perfection! I only wish we ordered the meat medium instead of medium rare. Although it was a little more pink than I usually have my pork, it was the chef's recommendation, and there were thankfully no bathroom episodes afterwards.Portions were definitely reasonable, especially with the delicious corn bread and biscuits that melt in your mouth they give you in the beginning.

I drank my coffee back at my desk and it was really, really good. Yes, that's my technical analysis. I'm so glad I also bought a bag of beans-- some kind of Ethiopian blend. I just finished drinking 30 oz. of it, and I'm hooked. I can't believe coffee that delicious came out of my Mr. Coffee!I'll also say it: BEST COFFEE IN PORTLANDLike a previous reviewer said, the shop is not quirky, but I thought that was refreshing.

I must have drove by this 'dive from the outside' restaurant 200 times...but walking into the big, open inviting interior was quite the surprise.We went with the pot stickers, basil chicken and salt/pepper pork chop.  All were outstanding.The pot stickers were a good size and were amazing.  Nice light thin wrap with good filling.  The soy sauce dip was also outstanding.The basil chicken had great flavor, a nice rich hearty sauce that covered the chicken.  The only problem with this dish is that they use dark meat instead of white meat.  Why is this?  Even if they offered a white meat option at additional cost they'd have a pure winner.The salt and pepper pork chops was the greatest in my book.  I don't think I've ever had pork chops this tasty ever.  Nice chunks of perfectly crispy fried pork chops that were nice and moist on the inside.  I haven't been to Bento yet but I can't imagine pork chops getting much better than this.  You get lots too, it was a plethora of pork.Overall, this place was quite the surprise.

Free fried food is fantastic.The stewed chicken dishes were good, but some were not extremely tender. When I eat Indian dishes like Chicken Masala I expect the meat to be so tender that it falls apart. The decor is nothing special. For me, ambiance is a big part of dining at an Indian restaurant.

But they have gone downhill ;(. Ever since their old chef left there has been a turnover of all new staff as well. Maybe the place was sold to new owners? Regardless, the food quality has gone way way down (the best beef brisket in Vancouver has now become one of the worst among other things), the staff are pretentious and always seem to be grumpy, and they don't have tvs anymore because they \\"are not a pub\\" (when I asked). You no longer taste the heart of this place in every dish.. There is no longer passion here. It pains me to say these things but I do not know what happened. Another sad story of a great Vancouver neighbourhood restaurant with character cooking with love, becoming a pretentious lifeless establishment that has obviously let the good reviews and hype change them for the worst.

I didn't care for the sweet potato medallions, but they were an interesting alternative to fries. My friend had the burger special, which was a bean burger. It was messy to eat, but she said it was really good. Her potato wedges were yummy. Her special was more expensive than my burger, which doesn't make sense to me.

The staff is both helpful and friendly, and the rooms  aren't anything exciting, but nicely updated and clean. The location ended up being ideal for us, as we weren't spending much time in downtown Portland (but for those that are, they may want to consider the westside). We got a great deal that included a free breakfast buffet (which was not a continental breakfast, but a full hot breakfast buffet), and free parking. The hotel is located near the freeways, and provided easy access to the airport.THE POOP:\\nThe hotel is in a strange part of town, definitely caters to the business crowd and folks going to the convention center. Like most of the city hotels, it is mandatory valet parking on the weekends, which can be a downer, but typical for cities. Lastly, and was not a huge deal, but the hotel gym/pool is incredibly tiny.

If you're allergic to lines, good - one less person I have to compete with. Compete with for what you ask?The best BBQ brisket the world has ever known, and there is no debate about this.The flavor that Franklin BBQ has is beyond words, and the secret ingredient is TLC. Everything is stellar, but it's the brisket that causes you to rationalize getting in line for BBQ at 7:45am. Juicy, smokey, and it falls apart in your mouth like butter. It's black as night on the outside, and the smoke ring goes nearly the whole way through. It's an absolute work of art.Sure, Aaron could add more pits and cut a few hours off the smoking, but then you don't have what people will wait 3+ hours for on a Thursday morning. And you would miss the girl selling beer from a grab bag to those waiting in line. And let's not forget the folding chair rental guy across the street, or the people you'll bond with while in line. That's right, Franklin has a multiplier effect.Seriously, this isn't just a restaurant with grub, it's an experience.Franklin has come a long way since its start as a food truck behind a fence of an abandoned gas station, and I couldn't be happier for Aaron and his crew. Great guy and people who love what they do and make, and will chat you up about it all. Do I wish I could go back to the days of only waiting 30-45 minutes in line?

We brought our fair share of beverages to help make the wait more enjoyable and even made friends with the fun fellow next to us.  Sure our total wait for food was 4 1/2 hours, but what else were we going to do that morning (sleep I guess...).  By the time we reached the counter, we had already been served yet another beer and were thoroughly hungry.  Between the 4 of us we ordered 2 lbs of brisket, 2 lbs of ribs, 1/4 lbs of turkey and sausage, and a few sides.  You can go ahead and ignore the turkey and sausage when ordering.  Not that they're bad at all, but they aren't as exceptional as the brisket and ribs.  The brisket literally melts in your mouth (not figuratively) and the ribs come right off the bone every time.  The only side truly worth your time is the beans.  They are both spicy and salty, perfect barbecue beans.

At first I came here out of convenience and necessity, but I quickly became a regular because they do things well. They have tasty coffee (great iced!), and an assortment of baked goods and sandwiches for breakfast or lunch. The vegan options even have flavors\\n that parallel traditional fare; a pleasant surprise for a non-vegan who ventures into that territory periodically. They have a variety of options ranging from healthy spinach and egg whites to the traditional gut-bomb breakfast sandwich, so you can pick to suit your needs. It's also ok to sit for awhile and work without getting hassled by anyone. The laid-back feel has not only been conducive to sitting and working; I've met several pleasant people and neighbors through random conversations and the staff have always been great to me. Many an idea or debate has sprung from the tables here.In summary, I enjoy the place for all the reasons you would like any good local coffee shop, but I love it because it's placed nearby so I'm never disgruntled about having only 1-2 real choices of coffee shop in the area (other is Dunkin). It says a lot when the only option is still a favorite option.In short, this has become my \\"third place\\" after home and work, and I'm not sure of the circumstances of previous reviewers, but can't help but wonder if any perceived \\"coldness\\" has been due to pretension or douche baggerie. The staff have been nothing but kind to me, and generally uber helpful.

One of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. Brisket = 100 out of 100. Friendly service. Wait for horrible weather to avoid the inevitable long line.Waited a little over in hour in gloomy, drizzly weather just past 1pm on a random Wednesday. With a few hours to kill before our flight back home to Los Angeles, my wife and I were able to sneak to la Barbecue right before and decided to check out Franklin on the off-chance that we'd be able to sneak in before a sell-out. Turns out other meats were not guaranteed but brisket would be! The wait in-line went by relatively quickly as we were giddy with nervous excitement. If la had been THAT good just an hour earlier, could Franklin match the hype?When we got to the service counter, the most hipster dude we had seen all week greeted us warmly and inquired if we were from out of town. He guessed LA or Anaheim (disclosure: I was rocking a Lakers hat and Mickey tee) and we revealed we were there for our honeymoon, which was true. He didn't believe us at first but we sheepishly replied we chose Austin for our honeymoon. This is when we experienced the largest helping of Texas hospitality ever. Let's just say that when we ordered a pound of brisket, we came away with much more and some extra complimentary fixins on our tray. We still cannot get over how incredibly nice the servers here were. It felt like Austin itself was saying goodbye. Okay, I'll stop now. Sat down to eat with a full tray. The brisket was as advertised: the best. THE BEST. Excellent smoke, full meaty flavor, and buttery perfectly positioned fat. How do they do that? Fifteen hours in the pit and it certainly shows. I don't think I could stand in line for hours all the time, but if I had to choose one place to eat brisket from for the rest of my life, it would be Franklin Barbecue. I recommend fatty over lean. That junk will melt into your consciousness.The sausage is good. The coleslaw and beans are good. But c'mon man, if you wait in line here, make sure you try some of this brisket.

Alas I had two very different experiences here. The first time I went here I had dinner. I brought a friend, and the place was empty. Completely. Empty. This doesn't usually bother me, except for the fact that the restaurant is ginormous and has tables as far as the eye can see. We were promptly seated, given a pot of hot tea, some water, and we ordered.  To start off with we had the scallion pancakes and fried crab claw. Both were fine, nothing special. I ordered the sweet and sour fish, while my  friend ordered pan fried calamari. Mine was bathing in sweet and sour sauce and was a bit on the greasy side. It was good, but a bit overwhelming. On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised by how well they had cooked my friends calamari. It was juicy and lightly seasoned with some steamed vegetables on the side. Overall, the dining experience was standard take out fare.Dim-sum for Sunday brunch, on the other hand, was a full 180. The restaurant was packed, with a group of people waiting at the door to be seated. We walked in, luckily, with a party of 10 and were promptly seated, as no one else had taken up one of the massive tables. Dim-sum madness ensued. My friends kept taking things off carts, to the point where I no longer knew what I was putting in my mouth. Oh well, as long as it tasted good. And it all did. Everything I ate, which was a lot, tasted amazing. Stand-outs were the turnip cake, pork bbq buns, and breaded garlic prawns -- amazing. Every dumpling was perfectly squishy and juicy! The only disappointment was the sticky rice rolled in banana leaves with beef. A bit bland. As far as the actualy restaurant goes, it's tacky asian fare. Giant golden dragons decorate the ceilings and waiters wear ridiculous red satin vests. It's pretty dirty, not gonna lie, but hey it's about as authentic as a dim-sum experience as you'll geat.

Marbled perfectly and not too fatty, it was flavorful, melt in your mouth perfection. Don't think I've had a brisket so tender in my life. I can see why there are lines for days. Everything else here... Was meh... Pre-ordered 5 pounds of meat so we didn't have to wait in line. Between 3 people that's way too much meat! My eyes are definitely bigger than my stomach. The sausage had a chewy skin on it I had to spit it out. The ribs were so meh to me (Philz BBQ in San  Diego is my favorite for ribs). I ate one rib and half way through I was so disappointed I didn't even want to even take these home. It was fall off the bone but it was so flavorless to me even bathing it in bbq sauce couldn't save it. The potato salad wasn't a sweet potato salad it was more of a vinegar/mustard potato salad. The coleslaw was only average, it wasn't sweet or sour it was just ruffage and a chewy crunchy texture to add to this overload of meat extravaganza we were having. I'm a bit of a sugar monger so I like all my bbq to be a bit on the sweet side including the sides so it left much to be desired for me personally. The bourbon banana cream pie was pretty tasty. There would be pockets of the pie where you get hit with the bourbon flavor. I had to eat this in two sittings but I liked it overall. I purchased one of their sauces to go as a gift  and realized its very water based versus a thick BBQ sauce. I guess its not either of the sauces they serve there as those were both thick...

I especially love food trucks when they're aggregated near my home! This food truck park happens every Thursday evening in Brook Run Park near the playgrounds in the summer into early Fall. There is ALWAYS a King of Pops Cart (YAY) and usually at least one other dessert option (cupcake truck or ice cream). The food trucks themselves rotate week by week and there is always a good selection no matter what you're in the mood for. The Food Truck nights are usually bustling with people of all ages and lots of dogs (well behaved!) on leashes. It's always a good time. This park has a paved 2 mile loop around the park (great walking trail) that also now connects to Pernoshal Park via a paved walkway so you can park further away and walk instead of fighting all the traffic in and out of the park via the only car entrance.Once you get your food, drinks, snacks etc, there are plenty of areas to sit down in both in the shade and under the sun if you're feeling vit D deprived.

The staff is super friendly striking up conversation and asking if you want to watch them make the pizzas. They do not serve drinks, but you can pop right next door to the convenience store and grab whatever you want, which is a larger selection then most restaurants. Bono use to have a BYOB policy, but now, due to legal restrictions, they are no longer able. Dining in was a hassle. The room barely fits two tables, and we sat down at one, to only have the next one taken in minutes, which caused the small space, to seem extremely small. But this is Bono, so you need to expect this. My suggestion is order pick up, since the pizzas are usually done within a record 10 minutes. That way you enjoy their delicious pizzas outside or at your house. The pizzas are rated like a normal wood fired pizza place, although their witty menu gives them some extra points. I would encourage anyone to try out this little Grandview treat, if  you are looking for a light, tasty, and unique pizza (just order out if a hot, small room is an annoyance to you)."},{"name":"Berkshire Farms Market","address":"1 Harborside Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Screw these guys.

There was more breading than clam and they were beaten to submission like a chicken thigh flattened for chicken Parmesan.  I only write this in the spirit of my loyalty and love for McCormick and Schmidt and their goal for continued excellence.  The razor clam should be treated with more respect and love as the delicacy it is and I would like to suggest to the chefs that cook them in all restaurants to consider the subject and other ways of cooking instead of throwing it into a pan covered in panko breading and frying it until you don't know what it is you are eating."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great ATL mainstay.

Last night on a busy Saturday I figured it might be a long shot to be able to get in for dinner, but as I had a friend visiting from Providence and we were close to Harvard Square we decided to go for it.  We got to the restaurant at about 6pm and put our names in for dinner, deciding to wait the estimated hour and a half over a drink at nearby Russell House Tavern instead of waiting in the queue for the bar (which serves the full menu).When we came back at about 7:30pm it turned out that their estimate was pretty good as we only found ourselves waiting another twenty minutes or so.  The house was packed from back to front even though it's pretty large, and even when we were on our way out at nearly 10pm the place was still buzzing and people were sitting down for dinner.  Far more fun and busy than most upscale restaurants nearby at this hour.The decor and ambiance are great; a great mix of hip without entirely capitulating to the \\"look\\" we all see on our Instagram feeds in the litany of trendy new spots across the country that all end up looking the same.  By the same token, the food was experimental and interesting without trying too hard, not to mention delicious.The complimentary picked green beans were an interesting starter, and we went on to order the broccoli, bone marrow croquetas, New York strip and the swordfish for two of us.  While I don't think the style quite amounts to \\"tapas\\" we were certainly able to share and enjoy the meal.  One thing that was a bit odd about the service was how staggered the dishes ended up coming out.  Although we knew that they came out \\"as ready,\\" it seemed odd that that meant nearly thirty minutes for the first plate (the croquetas), another seven or so for the broccoli, then about twenty minutes for the steak and finally the swordfish another ten or so after that.Despite this one strange component the service was lovely; kind people who seem to be genuinely excited about working in the restaurant, with none of the condescension that oftentimes accompanies working at the talk of the town. The food was all beautifully cooked and just delicious, I can't wait to come back and order the rest of the menu over the next couple weeks before I have to head back West."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Food:5 stars, Seating arrangement: 3 stars.We were in town for Halloween Horror Nights and had found this darling little breakfast place through Yelp on a Sunday morning. We were an average sized party for your typical dining establishment but a big party for Se7en Bites, considering you have to squeeze in where you can. The line wrapped around the corner and we saw a girl with a dog saving a table while her friend, partner, whatever, stood in line. Since we were a large party we decided to try and do the same but WE (not her) were told we could not. Now, y'all best believe if we are spending $100+ on breakfast that it would involve at least sitting down and having breakfast together. I think the lady with the red hair was so sweet though, there was this one girl who had a slice of cake and spent over an hour just picking at it but she couldn't get her to leave. Girl, in Miami they would've told you that ya gots to go!We ended up ordering three of the 7th trimesters, and a couple of the waffles with bacon. For dessert, we ordered a moon pie, two huge slices of the pride cake and a Nutella banana bread pudding.  The trimester was oustanding. The pasta was cheesy and warm, not to mention a taste bomb when coupled with the bacon and biscuit. The best part was drizzling some egg yolk all over your soft biscuit, and warm, cheesy pasta (food porn at its finest).  The Nutella banana bread pudding was also five stars. I was actually standing outside with it when I saw people in line talking about it and one girl came back outside to ask me what it was. It has more of a banana taste than a chocolate one but the warm banana slices up top were a nice touch after having the trimester, not to mention the bread pudding was still warm and fluffy.I did enjoy the food at Se7en Bites but when we got our food and there was no place to sit, we had to have them box it up and we proceeded to eat it in our car.

The FoH is always courteous and informative, and our orders have never taken took long.

THAT is what I called being dialled in to your customer's basic expectations and I really respect that. \\nMy one sole criticism of this place is this: We're all loving the loud music and the party vibe but having the FoH yell \\"ORDER NUMBER FIVE THIRTY FIVE\\" over a dubstep remix of Rihanna yelling out what I think is the word \\"work\\" over and over accomplishes nothing. There is also not enough room downstairs for everyone to wait for their order. Thus, my suggestion would be to put a ticket number display on the wall of the mezzanine so everyone wins-customers get fresh, unsoggy (that's not a word) orders and the FoH isn't shouting out only to have customers miss it altogether.

My boyfriend and I asked for his recommendation for brunch cocktails and ordered what we were expecting to be similar to a bellini, so we were confused when the runner brought us drinks that were more like moscow mules. When the server came back, we asked if these were the correct drinks and he quite rudely asserted that they absolutely were correct and stomped away to get a menu to prove that he was right.

Then I opened the menu.First, the prices are outrageous for an Allston Mexican restaurant (even if the food was good, which I'll get to in a second). Allston is full of college kids looking for fast, cheap, decent food. This place serves none of those needs. I cannot believe they would charge upwards of $18 for the food that they had.The service - well, the owner was really nice and seemed concerned. We were asked if everything was ok about 30 times. I took this as a bad sign. Our waitress, who I'm just going to call Helga, was pretty atrocious. I understand the restaurant is fairly new, so maybe that accounts for some of the problems. Helga had to come back 4-5 times just to take our initial order because she forgot to ask the right questions, Helga had no idea what beers they had in stock, and was just extremely disorganized. Helga had so much trouble taking our plates from the table it was comical, and her overall demeanor was just piss poor and uninterested. Like I said though, the owner seemed sweet.The food - Depending on what you get, it ranges from inedible to OK. I went with a big group of people and there were some differing opinions - nobody thought it was worth the money. Don't get anything with chicken - it smelled awful and didn't taste any better. It tasted like it had been just boiled for 3 days then frozen then reheated and minced. They did give us lots of chips and salsa for free, however, which was nice. The cheese dip was ok and one of the better deals there, because otherwise I would have left really, really hungry - there was little on my plate I actually wanted to eat after I had tried it.  Finally, they serve you black beans with most of the dishes - they are just gross. They're like 3x refried and mashed, and stomped on then refried. I have no idea what they are doing to them.Summary: Overpriced, inattentive/inexperienced waitstaff, really nice friendly interior, caring owner, middling food. Probably will not go back again. If they turned this into a Taco Bell, they would make way more money.

The non-moist pieces were tender, but dry and a bit pasty. Pork Ribs was moist and tender. Ribs did not fall off the bone until i bit into it. When I bite into the rib, only the piece I bit into came away, leaving the rest of the meat on the bone. The cartilage from the pork ribs was not tender and not easy to bit into. Sausage was good with a nice smoke flavor.\\n3. Taste was overall pretty good. I liked the moist part of the brisket b/c it had a better smoke and flavor.

They have outdoor seating, but it's closed off on the weekends (at least from my experience). Minus this section, this Clover is still pretty big, but you may have to wait to sit down because there's a lot of people chilling around on their laptops. That and this is right near the T stop and there aren't too many other food joints around.Since they don't have a register, I always get asked by someone behind the counter whether I have questions and/or if I'm ready to order. Sometimes they ask three or four times before I actually know what I want, so that can be pretty annoying. I appreciate their willingness to take my order though.... but I am an inheritly indecisive person!I'm a carnivore, but I've learned to appreciate strictly vegetarian meals especially after making a couple of trips to Clover. Their chickpea fritters are divine, but they always give out so little of it! The platter comes with some delicious hummus, pickled onions, cabbage, carrots, tomato and cucumber salad, and tahini. It's very filling, but I always want more of the falafel!  The two side salads are absolutely awesome too, I like how they change those on a daily basis. I highly recommend trying the curry cauliflower and potato salad, so good! The fries aren't the crispiest, but they are pretty low in calorie so I don't ever feel guilty eating a whole order by myself. And while I don't usually like sugary drinks, I always order strawberry lemonade when I'm here.. it's only 89 calories and is super refreshing.Unlike other Clover spots, they don't have prepared sides and meals.

Rib meat is pink to midway to the bone and explodes with juices. These are giant spare ribs that are tender and have a superb smoky flavor; sauce is completely unnecessary although multiple are available for sampling. My preference tends to the Pitboss.

Both were incredibly delicious. My husband got the Puff the Magic Popper and the Slappy Pappy's Super Sloppy. He really enjoyed both as well. They offer lettuce wraps and vegan dogs so there are options for those with more restrictive diets as well. We went on a weekday around Christmas for lunch and the restaurant was crowded. The service was very fast though, so if you can't get a table right away, I can't imagine you would have to wait very long.

I'm working on blocking small annoyances out of bothering me in daily life but for my Yelp review it took a star off. Thankfully the woman working the counter apologized graciously. Wait wasn't too bad considering it was lunch on a Friday and the reubenette was a pretty average sandwich. Nothing impressed me about this place, nor really bothered me all that much which is why I gave it just a plain 3 star review.

When the weather is nice, my husband and I like to sit out on the porch with drinks while we listen to whichever local band is playing. If we're out late on the weekends, this is the place to go for Happy Hour 10pm-close. Sometimes we just like to meet friends at the bar, grab some drinks and appetizers. But my favorite part about coming here is to eat before concerts. Always make a reservation if it's a concert night otherwise you'll be waiting. Certain concerts will have the Pass the Line option where you need to spend $25 on food and then you'll be allowed in a separate line from general admission and this line gets in sooner. This past week my friend and I made reservations for 4:30pm since we had a concert starting at 6pm. We arrived a few minutes ahead of our reservation but still had about a 10 minute wait. Our server was really friendly, checked on us constantly and was able to point out some new menu options. That's another thing I like, they change their menu so if I haven't been in a while there's something new to check out. Sadly they got rid of my favorite flatbread but the Jalapeno cornbread ($10) is still there! That is a must try! Both my friend and I ordered one each and I snacked on that the entire time. What I didn't love was that our appetizers and entrees were delivered within 5 minutes of each other. We were already at a pretty small two person table so there wasn't a lot of room for all of our food and drinks. For my entr√©e I went with something quick and easy since we had to head out to the line. I ordered a chicken sandwich ($15) on a brioche bun with slaw and pickles. The bread was really soft and I liked the sweetness of the pickle. Sadly a small piece on the end of my sandwich was uncooked. I didn't end up reporting it though because we would have been late to our show. At the end of the day, I know that's not representative of how every meal is here and this is the first time I've had an issue. I absolutely recommend coming here! My husband is a big fan of their Juicy Lucy burger and you can't say no to their fried chicken. We have another concert in a month or so and I'm definitely going to be trying the Pimento cheese dip.

They both tasted well enough though the only difference between the jalepeno brisket and their normal one is a little green sauce they add to it that doesn't actually taste like much.  On top of that they charge an extra $2. Prices here are pretty high for a BBQ joint but I guess you spend for the atmosphere.Their waiters were really bad though.  We sat there right next to the bar and just watched 4-5 of them talk away sitting around.  When we walked in, we asked them if they were going to show a special program on the tv they said they'd ask the manager.  We literally sat 6 feet from where he was at and never saw him leave his station.  He never got back to us either. Our waiter brought us the food and basically ignored us afterwards.

The soft boiled egg was delicious!

Always dependable food and service. This was my first visit since the renovation.The entire place has been toned down a bit with earth tone colors, which is quite nice. Even the beaded curtain separating the bar from the dining room has been tossed. Overall, the aesthetic changes are good.As usual, service was good and dependable, but this time I felt it was not exceptional as it has been in the past. It was a Monday evening, 6:30pm reservation, and we were the first party seated in the dining room. Might have something to do with it.Menu has changed quite a bit from last visit. There is a daily tasting menu. and while it looked fantastic, entire party must select the tasting menu. Better if individual diners could chose the option in my opinion, but I am sure there is a good reason. The menu design is completely different. Snacks are listed first, and while they can be ordered as appetizers, there are in fact, not appetizers. I had the garlic toasted ciabatta and it was wonderful. Vegetables are listed second, and are actually salads. I had the arugula, endive, grapefruit, fennel, parmesan, citrus vinaigrette and it too was wonderful. After the salad, some form of bread was brought to the table. Unfortunately, I did not ask the server what type it was, but it was awesome. Almost seemed like a cheese bread. Whatever is was, I highly recommend it. The next parts of the menu are divided into Seafood and Meats sections. Here is the trick.....the items listed in bold are entrees and those items not in bold are appetizers. How clever.The crab cake and duck confit appetizers were out of this world. I ordered the beef short ribs and could not be happier with my choice. For the dessert, I ordered the lemon pound cake and the angel food strawberry cake. Both were delicious, but the lemon pound cake was freaking incredible.This review may sound like I enjoyed this place a bit too much. Well, I did. There is nothing whatsoever that I could think of that left me wanting (other than the tasting menu option mentioned above). I put this restaurant easily in the top 10 of Atlanta restaurants and that is only because my top five is full of steakhouses (Bones, Chops, Kevin Rathman Steak, Capital Grille, McKendricks).

My boyfriend had a full rack of ribs and he ate every bite enthusiastically and said they were tender and delicious.  They serve everything with several slices of Sunbeam bread, which is a quaint touch.The people who work there are super-friendly, and the night we went they had an awesome blues band playing.  I wish I could truly do justice to how great a night we had there - everything was perfect!We went on a Saturday night around 8:30 and there was a line out the door when we got there, but it moved quickly and we were able to get a table by the time we finished ordering.  By the time we left, though, around 10 or so, they had run out of chicken and ribs.  I didn't factor that into my rating, since we got our food and it was fantastic!

I called the day beforehand and specifically asked if it was toddler friendly and the lady on the phone assured me it was. No kid menu. The brunch menu was so small that I actually ordered an entr√©e with meat when I typically do not eat it- and picked around it. I watched 2 other tables leave the restaurant after looking at the menu. Note: I asked if their regular menu was available and it was not. \\nSecond, service was just bad. Slow and ignorant of the menu. She had to ask the chef about everything we inquired about. We wanted some bread because we were waiting so long and had a hungry mommy, daddy and kiddo- we were told that it would cost like an extra buck. I said that was ok. I guess she assumed 'ok' meant that we didn't want it. I asked her about it after she came back and said she would have to have them make it and did we want a half loaf or full. We said half, as our food was surely coming soon. Sure enough, our food beat the bread. \\nLast, bread finally came (with no butter) and it was not very good. No biggie since we had our food- until we got the check and were charged $4. We are not cheap about food but that was just ridiculous. We asked about the fact that the bill charged for a full loaf and our waitress informed us that was the only way it came. What? Why did you ask us if we would prefer a half? Just really sloppy service. And the loaf didn't look like a full one either. \\nI will say that the food we ordered was yummy, so they have that going for them and I will give an extra star for that.

(But every Southern meal my Grandma made when I was growing up, always had a side of coleslaw, so Screen Door keeps that tradition going!) I had the kahlua chocolate cheesecake for dessert and I was so frickin' excited about how good it was. It was perfectly dense and had just the right amount of sweetness. The chocolate wafer crust had the perfect ratio to the cheesecake. I couldn't finish it, so I took the leftover cheesecake home and had a happy food moment all over again the next day. I really hope they have it the next time we go there! The staff was wonderful and accommodating. We sat down at a 2 person table inside and it felt like we were in an oven, so we asked to be moved to outside and they took care of us right away. The waiter was pleasant and helpful.

The portions are quite large so I'd recommend sharing a few dishes and taking a box home. The dish I was most excited about getting on my first visit was the fried chicken and waffles. I quickly changed my mind after seeing the guy next to me ordered them.  The plate held one waffle with 3 large fried chicken breasts stacked on top with a knife through the middle holding it all together. I'm a big meat eater but the proportion of chicken to waffle looked kind of ridiculous. Everyone I saw eating then took at least an entire chicken breast home with them.

The owner and staff are super friendly and offer to let you watch your pizzas cook in the oven. I recommend the San Rolando and the Carbonara. The eat-in area has 3 small tables and a bar that seats 5. They take their last order at 9:30pm if not sold out. All drinks must be purchased in the adjoining carry-out.

I am a fan of not only the meats but also the sides here; I'm usually not expecting sides to be extraordinary, but they do sides really well here.  They have your usual suspects like coleslaw, mac & cheese, and brunswick stew; you also can step out of the box with your sides by trying the fox-a-roni (a combination of m&c and brunswick stew) and chili mac (pretty self-explanatory).  You can play it safe or step out of your comfort zone; you won't be disappointed either way.I recently learned that they serve baby back ribs exclusively on Mondays.  The baby back ribs have a better meat-to-bone ratio than the usual spare ribs on the menu, and they taste better too.  It's a terrific way to remedy your case of the Mondays.Carpooling / Uber is a must here because the available parking space does not match the actual restaurant's capacity especially on the weekends.

I knew the deal - arrive by 10am (9am is ideal) to ensure that you'll get in before they sell out. Bring reading material and maybe a folding chair to maximize your comfort. My lovely hubs kept me company, which made the 2+ hour wait a lot more bearable. We liked peeking at Aaron Franklin and friends, tending to the 'cue. And feeling smug as several folks popped out of taxis in their business suits, shocked to discover that they were too late to get in on the deliciousness. As the line wended its way into the building, it definitely conjured up childhood memories of anxiously awaiting Space Mountain at Disneyland.By the time we made it to the front of the line, we ordered a pound of fatty brisket, a pound of pork ribs, a 1/4 pound of pulled pork, and a pint of potato salad. We knew we'd barely make a dent, but wanted to enjoy Franklin for a few more meals. The pork ribs were fan-freakin'-tastic. Seriously, like butter. Meaty, delicious butter. The brisket was delish. Nom nom nom. The pulled pork was good, but paled in comparison to the other meats. The potato salad was nice and mustardy with some dill pickle slices thrown in for good measure. That being said, skip the sides and focus on the stars of the show.Franklin completely lived up to its hype. The line can be a drag, but the wait is most certainly worth it.

FIrst of all, the service was phenomenal. Our guy was very friendly, knowledgeable, and happy to make recommendations. We started with some cocktails, and I tried a mezcal drink (French Connection) for the first time based on the server's description. It was a unique drink; intensely smoky and smooth. I am definitely glad I tried it, although I don't think this is a flavor profile everyone would enjoy. JAM's vieux carre was expertly made as well, very impressed with the drinks they are putting out. The food! To start our table shared some small plates of beet-cured salmon, oysters, and chicken liver mousse. The mousse had great flavor and was silky smooth. The oysters served with lemon and a simple mignonette were perfect. The beet-cured salmon was not my favorite in terms of flavor, but was nice when paired with the radish slices and roe. And my God was the presentation of that salmon one of the most gorgeous I've seen. For my main the server recommended the halibut, and it was perfectly cooked, served with a lentil and pea medley and some sort of tasty sauce. I appreciated that this was not over salted. JAM's pork chop was falling apart and had a hint of sweetness in the glaze, the chicken was also supposedly delicious. For desert we shared the carrot cake and bouche sucree. The bouche sucree was baked meringue with lemon cream, blueberries, and pistachio. It was super unique and a real surprise-very good!

Petrol heads need not be disappointed because parking is conveniently located at the Porter Square Exchange mall right across the road. I have never seen them get super crowded, even on Friday evenings, so usually I have got a table pretty quickly. Like I said, I have always liked this place to a beer and burger joint. On the occasions I ventured into the appetizer territory, I was disappointed; especially their tortilla chips. The spicy pepperjack burger is my perennial favorite to go with a few of their ever changing beers on tap. Burgers, standard or made to order, are served with thick fatty fries and I have a number of occasions tried hard to finish all of them. Service has been standard as well.

We thought about leaving (like I said we didn't know) and decided that we would suffer our hunger pangs and wait.  Best decision we ever made.

The decor and atmosphere is really cool and it was a breath of fresh air to have a new and trendy restaurant to try. It was a total bonus that they happened to be having a special on bottled wine, 25% off! The service was great, although (since it is still a new restaurant) I think they really need to work out some kinks in their ordering and delivery system. We got every single item we ordered at the same time. Salad, soup, entree, everything . . . but, they were totally cool about it and did everything they absolutely could to make it right. As a customer, I really appreciated that! As for the food, I ordered the Mushroom soup (OFF THE CHARTS), the Flat Iron Steak (OFF THE CHARTS), & the Endive Salad (Meh, I didn't really like this, but the my friend raved about it . . . I guess it's just a matter of taste.) Also, the bread and butter is really yummy!!!!!!! Loved it!!! I do have to give management some feedback on the dessert: We ordered the Pumpkin Ganache, and it took everything I had to not bust out in total laughter when it was delivered to us. It was $9 and the tiniest dessert I have ever seen in my life. It was literally the size of a wheat thin with a marble-sized scoop of Pumpkin Ganache and a marble sized scoop of ginger ice cream. It's not enough for one person, much less 2 people. It was really quite funny!  It was a dessert for ants. The rest of the portions were very nice-sized . . . I just could not figure this one out.  I'd also like to see a better variety of side items. There were only three to choose from and the sides were kind of weak. I have a feeling they rotate them in and out depending on the night.With all that being said. The place is awesome! Except for the one small snafu, the service was excellent. The food was excellent, I just hope they can do something to improve on the dessert and side items. All and all, I definitely recommend and look forward to my next visit.Also, I noticed the have a big table that seats about 10 people and it is under a magnificent chandelier.

Franklin. Around my 30th birthday, I went to try out it. I had heard about the place from a friend. I got there 20 minutes before they opened to wait in line. The line moved pretty fast. Aaron and his wife were operating out of a trailer at the time. I tried the brisket, ribs, and sausage that day. I thought it was really good especially the ribs. I thought the moist brisket was better than most places, but the lean brisket was really salty. The sides were okay. I really do not eat a whole lot of sides when I go to BBQ restaurants now. It is all about the meat. That's what she said. Shortly after that, they opened a brick and mortar location downtown. I went and ended up waiting in line for over an hour. I thought the brisket was the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. I was hooked at that moment.Most professional critics go to the same place three times before they write a review. I have been to Franklin a half dozen times now since it first opened. This review has been in the works for a very long time. There has been only one time since the initial visit that the brisket was not amazing. Franklin's off day is still better than most barbecue places' good day. This last time I went, the wait was almost two hours. I do not know if I am getting old or what, but I was very impatient this time. The restaurant opens at 11 am, but I got there at 10 am. I was hoping the line was short because it was a Thursday. Boy it was wrong. It was about 30 people deep when I got there.When I finally got to the counter, I ordered two slices of moist brisket, two pork ribs, and a link of sausage. Aaron was behind the counter taking orders and slicing the meats. He is very personable and can carry a conversation with you for a while. He always thanks you for coming in. The prices on their plates have gone up since I had been there. Getting the two meat plate used to be the better deal. The times I ordered by the pound, I spent more than I needed and had too much food. This time I felt like I ordered the perfect amount of food. I had a little left over which I am sure Amber was happy about. The brisket was excellent. It is definitely the best brisket I have ever had. It has a nice bark, and the meat is so tender with a good smoke ring. Aaron uses certified angus beef. Using a higher quality cut goes a long ways and it shows. The fat renders better in a quality brisket. I sometimes dip the brisket in the espresso sauce. The espresso sauce is thick and velvety but yet so smooth. The ribs just fall apart which are also excellent. I know a good rib is supposed to have a little give on the bone, but who cares? If the meat falls off the bone, it is cooked right in my opinion. The sausage is very good as well. I do not think he makes his own sausage, but the casing does have a nice pop to it. I have had the pulled pork in the past which I have enjoyed. I have also tried the turkey which is good, but turkey is not my thing. When it comes to barbecue of late, I avoid the sides. I have gotten sides in the past here because it came with the combo plates. The coleslaw is my favorite side here. It is not heavy on mayonnaise and taste fresh. Franklin has a sandwich called the Tipsy Texan. It has to best sandwich in the world. In between two buns are chopped beef, sliced sausage, and coleslaw. What a great combination! It is messy, but it is so f-ing good. The beans are not bad and have bits of brisket in it. I am not a fan of their potato salad. It is mustard based which I do not like.Franklin is a must for anyone who likes barbecue. It is barbecue bliss. You think you know what good barbecue is and then when you eat at Franklin, your whole world changes. You then start to look for places that serves better barbecue. At this point, I have yet to find anything better. My search continues. If you have not tried Franklin, definitely try it. It is worth standing in line at least once. I would love to eat at Franklin more, but I just do not have enough time to stand in line. Someone want to save me a spot?"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"WOW, such fantastic brisket.I was in the area for work and was told if I could make the time available that I should go early and wait in line.

They turned on misters to keep us cool and came out selling drinks as well.  The people around me were all local folks and I envy them to be able to get this BBQ whenever they have an urge.I went with the brisket, some to eat there and 5 pounds to take home, the owner himself was there cutting it up and providing little morsels to taste as he cut.  Also offered some tidbits on reheating that worked well.  When I got home I cut the brisket into 1lb chunks and triple wrapped it and put it in the freezer.  When we were in the mood we simply thawed it out, cut it into pencil thick slices onto some tin foil and put a little water and a little butter on it and cooked in the oven for about 25 minutes, Fantastic.If you get the chance and have the time I would say GO!Best regards, Tony"},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We stopped by Cypress for a bite and a beer recently.

They were finishing their meal and left soon after. We had a great meal. Then a member of the wait staff came to the table and politely reprimanded us not to tell people to leave a table because we wanted to sit down. We were utterly confused. Said employee told us that the couple who had been at our table were friends of the owner and called him to complain that we kicked them out of their table. The owner then called the restaurant and chewed out an employee over this.

At least it was sunny!A friend and I decided to split The Everything Plate and piled on the sides. Our final platter consisted of half a chicken, ribs, fatty brisket, pulled pork, and their special of the day, a jalape√±o cheddar sausage. We paired that with spicy green beans, chili mac, brunswick stew, chili, and some cornbread. Needless to say, our eyes were wayyyy bigger than our stomachs.I thought the meat quality overall was pretty good. My favorite was the fatty brisket and the chicken. The brisket was tender and moist, but fortunately not too fatty. I loved how moist and tender the chicken was, although I wasn't the biggest fan of the white sauce. Maybe it wasn't hitting the spot that day because everyone else was raving about it. In terms of sides, the chili mac was incredible. There's something about the combination of cheese, meat, and carbs, and this side hit all three amazingly. I could make a meal of it (and probably regret it after too haha). The spicy green beans were also quite tasty and healthy tasting-ish with a bit of kick. The cornbread had its own surprises, including bits of cream cheese hidden in the middle.All in all, I thought our visit was pretty decent for a southern BBQ experience. To be honest, nothing really made the experience unforgettable and worth a trip down by itself, but I did appreciate the service, the flavors, and I'm glad to have checked it off my list."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I have never been disappointed with this restaurant's service or food.

We went here with some friends for an engagement celebration. It's a great place to go with a bunch of people because of the small plates and the community sharing of dishes. Some of the memorable dishes were: The bread and garlic so delicious, the cornbread brussel sprouts were so amazing, definetly the one of the best preparations of brussel sprouts that I have ever had. Also the much talked about shrimp toast was quite tasty. Finally, the dessert board was really good, the only beef with it was that it didn't seem like that much for 4 people, each person had 1 bite of each thing that was on there.

Not a complaint, just preference.(Now, I'm well aware that salt is used generously when smoking or slow cooking meats in quantity, but it was just a little heavy for MY taste)I believe good BBQ needs no sauce, but to be fair I sampled each sauce. \\nEspresso BBQ - little overpowering.

Not really. It's good, but really not worth the hype or the wait. \\nWill I come back? Maybe if I have out of town visitors or a group of people who really, really want to try it.

My un-boyfriend ordered the lobster/sweet potato soup, which was the best food we sampled that night.  The rest of the food we ordered (trout, beef, celery root soup and desserts)were no better than food from Picadilly.  So with one drink each, we dropped $100 including tip.

Then we planned a lunch party.The golden day arrived and we walked right past the score of people waiting in line to a little shack in back. They were super cool Austin-ites. They cut up the brisket for us and we went to a local house where a friend lives. That BBQ is absolutely the best I've had as I try every BBQ joint in Texas. It IS everything you hear about. You'll pay for it, but like Disney - sometimes you gotta pay to play hard. The sausage was good but gristly at times. Not sure I would repeat it. The absolute surprise was the turkey. Holy crap why don't more people rave about it? I wish we would have seriously bought more of it. Trust me here - get the brisket, but also make sure you try the turkey.Had all three sides and wasn't excited about any of them. The beans actually were the best of the three.

That aside, some other pros and cons. The pros: Cozy ambiance and pretty tasty food. The rabbit and mushroom main dishes were very good and the salmon main dish was pretty good. However, the food alone won't be sufficient to draw us back any time soon - especially since we couldn't order their signature chicken dish. The cons: the service was a bit too Applebee's for the price point and ambiance. Our server was intrusive to conversation and editorialized the food (e.g. \\"and here is your delicious and gorgeous Salmon\\" - As the customer, I'll be the judge of whether it's delicious and gorgeous, thanks.) Also, the music was out of place. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think throbbing base is the best accompaniment to cozy French cuisine. I think Cocotte stands a chance in Portland's competitive market if they: figure out their supply challenges with chicken, give their service a bit of coaching, and define the ambiance they are trying to create.

Most Cantonese families dine in but I like to get it to go. Less risk of being overcharged, you don't have to chase grumpy cart people around to get what you want and you can have pleasant conversation without the deafening background noise. For Cantonese families, eating dim sum is the main social event with sometimes noisy conversation, crying babies, children running amok. ha ha good memories. I've had better dim sum in California but this place is pretty good. The prices are lower than California. I'd eat here again. It's better than the dim sum in Portland, OR which is where I usually go. If you are new to dim sum and want to have the Hong Kong dim sum experience, this is a good place to dine in.

My husband and I made the trek from Dallas early Saturday and arrived around 8:15 but we sat in the car until we saw some others starting to trickle in.  We were probably 5th in line and it's no joke that you need to come early because by around 9:30-10 am the line was near the end of the building.  The open at exactly 11 am but if you need to use the restroom you're welcome to go and use the one inside before they open which is great because I thought I was going to have to drive to a gas station if I needed to go. On to the food...I got the two meat plate with ribs and lean brisket while the husband got fatty brisket and sausage. Our sides consisted of cole slaw, potato salad and beans.  The potato salad was pretty generic and I'd skip that. My husband liked their coleslaw and the beans were awesome and I wish I had gotten double beans. \\nNow I love brisket and it's usually my first choice when eating BBQ but I think the ribs here outshone the brisket by far. I'm still thinking about them now and if I were to go back I'd get strictly ribs because they were that good. I didn't care for the sausage at all and I guess the husband didn't either because he only ate half of the link he was given. Would I return here and wait 3 hours again for BBQ? Probably not but the experience was fun and we did enjoy the food but not enough to wait that long. They do let you order food a few weeks in advance to pick up because we saw a few people doing that so I'd do that next time but I think there is a minimum so you'd have to call for details."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Some of the best plates of food I've ever had.

We could not carry on any kind of conversation.  Second, our waiter recommended we upgrade to a special house bourbon in our cocktails, and said that it would be \\"a couple of dollars\\" more expensive.  To me, this means $2.  When I received my check, I was quite surprised to see that I had been charged $19 for a Manhattan.  My fried chicken was $20, and I can't believe this is what I was charged for one drink!

Corned beef hash and eggs. Eggs cooked perfectly. Big chunks of meat and potato. Not really what you would expect in a hash. The potatoes were crisp on the outside like fried chunks of potatoes. Turns out the tasty secret is they are cooked in lard. I did not ask what type of lard as sometimes it's best not to know. Grits with the plain breakfast were ok.

I got my lips around some South City Kitchen cuisine and I liked it. Just off 14th tucked in on Crescent you will find this upscale southern eatery.Despite how long it's been there it still looks fresh and bright. Clean, modern but homey. It can be tough to pull that off but they are doing it in style. Looks matter. Don't lie and say they don't. It's a two story full utilized house turned to all levels of delicious.The menu is absolutely southern. If a dish doesn't naturally lean toward southern it is MADE southern on this menu. ie, a ceasar salad with fried okra. Take that, ceasar!There is a specialty drink menu that I opted to order from. Casa Blanca? Don't mind if I do. Tequila, rosemary,  St. Germain all come together in one happy union.  Notable wine list with a lively action filled bar (behind and in front) that looks promising even before you order any libation.The bread basked is a southern classic, impossibly tender buttermilk biscuits and sweet soft cornbread muffins. Whipped butter is the perfect accessory to this outfit.I ordered up the peach salad to start. Diced juicy ripe sweet peached adorn baby romaine leaves. Additional garnishes of hazelnuts and sweet grass green hill cheese (a Georgia creamery). Sweet pleasant vinagrette brings it all together. While this salad is tasty the cheese is awkard rather than complimentary. I kept thinking it should be a chevre vs something hard and dull in flavor.She crab soup is tasty. Dense roux base thickening with plenty of shellfish stock and very fine bits of crab. Nice flavor. Have a cup, you may tire after more than that to go with a full on bowl. Now for what I really came for. FRIED CHICKEN. I sat there watching easily a dozen plates of this coming out of the kitchen and couldn't wait until one of those plates were coming to me. Incredibly perfect traditional fried chicken. Crisp as you want it without sacraficing moistness.  Smashed skin on potatoes are the bed and I opted for fresh corn and tomato basil side.  A polish plate of southern comfort indeed.  Next we had some pan seared duck. Naturally a duck fat roasted potato adorned this plate along with some tender sauteed spinach.  If you aren't a fan of sweet fruit sauces on your duck you will love this brown garlic jus. It's a bit jarring to see catfish on the menu (does anyone even like catfish?) but trout and scallops are a welcome sight. The service is nothing short of delightful. Attentive, cheerful and seemless. It was worth the wait.

Me too. And let me tell you, BK just doesn't cut it. Tasty Burger fills a need that no fast food chain, diner or gourmet restaurant can. It's tasty, locally-sourced, quality food. You read right. The ingredients at Tasty Burger are free-range, local, hormone-free, and all that other new wave-y good stuff! You can't go wrong with The Big Tasty. I'm not a pickles and onions kind of gal, but I'm a strong believer that menus are there for a reason: it's a concrete list of what the establishment does best. So if they put pickles and onions on the cheeseburger, maybe that means pickles and onions belong on that cheeseburger. They definitely let you add or subtract things to your liking - they call these \\"mods\\" (modifications)- but I say just roll with it. I've also tried the BBQ Onion Burger and the Spicy Jalape√±o Burger, and both were delicious. If you go with two people, the 50-50 onion rings and fries are the way to go. I also love their shakes! They have beer too, usually a nice rotating selection. There's an outdoor take-out window with heaters in the winter and there are picnic tables outside. I bet this location is slammed in the summertime, as it's usually busy inside during the winter. We've either nabbed two spots at the bar or had food to-go. There's usually a wait for tables at night, so plan accordingly. There are about 10 usable parking spots (don't be fooled by the other 30 in the back...those are run by a private company and they chase after you if you park in a spot and make you pay!) There are some meters on the street that are sometimes open, but I recommend walking or riding your bike (or Hubway) because you're probably going to need to even out this meal with some exercise anyway. The one criticism I have is the \\"combo\\" vs. a la carte. You're going to get a beer when you come to Tasty Burger, so why would I get a combo that includes a 16 oz drink and fries for $3? The burgers do not come with fries, which is pretty disappointing. I wish they charged a dollar more to add the fries (and the portion could be reduced because they give a lot of fries) and forget the soda business.

First of all, it was super duper claustrophobic in there, and I hate eating in close quarters (even just standing in line or visiting the restroom was claustrophobic). Way too many people squeezed in there. It even made me anxious to order, because there were so many people, and they were trying to rush us through. And it was hard to see and figure out what one wanted, especially since it is hard to find a menu online before you come. They had an outside but it was unfortunately extremely hot the time we came.I loved the dress of the employees and the artsy feel of the place though and the creativity of the dishes.The food...again I really wanted to like it. It was totally up my alley...but didn't quite make it. I had the biscuits with thyme gravy. I knew as soon as they put the plate down, there was WAY too much biscuit in ratio to gravy. When I asked about extra gravy they went into a whole explanation about it was measured (apparently with the wrong measurement!)...blah, blah, blah, I was getting anxious with the server in my personal space like everyone else in the restaurant, and it was basically an overdrawn speel to say no you can't have more gravy. Or it is going to be a pain in the you know what to get it. The touch of thyme in the gravy was a nice touch though. I would have loved it with a better ratio. Luckily my husband decided to save space for the next meal and let me pick off a lot of the gravy. We just left a ton of uneaten biscuit...what a waste. (Besides, what does that say about the food in front of him, that he is already thinking about the next meal--yikes! Although there is a lot of great food in Orlando that we always have trouble squeezing it all in.).We also got their supposedly amazing and really expensive Mac and cheese...which was definitely not worth it.

But the margarita more than made up for it.We got our table and we greeted with their chips and salsa, something many people have raved about but I found a bit lackluster.

We started with some drinks -- Spencer Trappist was on tap which was very exciting!We also ordered a few appetizers to start: fried cheese steak dumplings with spicy tomato aioli and the 5-layer dip. The dumplings were awesome, and I especially liked the aioli. I was a bit underwhelmed by the 5-layer dip -- it seemed like something I could make at home.

Falafel wrap - Wolf & Bear's falafels are huge, thick patties made with chickpeas and served in a warm, slightly charred pita wrap. The falafels are soft, yet firm, and full of flavor. The wrap is stuffed with homemade hummus, sweet strips of caramelized onions, juicy grilled eggplant, roasted red peppers, and plenty of tangy tahini sauce. Oh my lawd. So fah-reaking orgasmic! Plus, the falafels are grilled, not fried! Sabich wrap - this is a traditional Iraqi/Jewish breakfast sandwich, filled with creamy hummus, a hard-boiled egg, diced onions, salad greens, cucumbers, parsley, pickles, grilled eggplant, and amba (mango pickle), all topped with a house tahini sauce. Substitute the egg for potatoes and you'll have yourself a mouthwatering vegan wrap! I seriously cannot decide on which wrap I adored more. It's like asking me to pick my favorite child (if I actually had kids). I think it might be the falafel wrap because I've always loved falafels, but just by a wee bit. Don't forget the green cilantro hot sauce! I can't handle spicy foods but I kept on squeezing that zesty green sauce onto my wraps!

Don't let that turn you away though; there are some areas to park very close by. Some of the reviews I read mentioned portapotty restrooms and cash only which are no longer the case. They do take cards and the restrooms are very clean and located inside the bar. Now for the positives! The service here was great on a Friday night. We chose to sit on the patio since it was a little cramped and loud inside. We were checked on regularly and everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful. The drinks are good, not too overpoweringly strong and not weak. My boyfriend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich (sometimes you just want something simple!) and from my taste it was spot on and delicious. I enjoy the vibe here and the patrons all seem friendly.

Get there early, bring a good book, take advantage of the complimentary coffee, and sit your ass down to wait for one of the most divine brunches this city has to offer.

My mom had the pork chop, which was also really good, although there was a slightly alpine flavor to it that I wasn't expecting - interesting!By the time we got to dessert, they were out of the yeasted donut I had seen float by the table several times, which was disappointing - but we ordered the sorbet and both flavors (orange-vanilla & meyer lemon) were good. The lemon sorbet was a little too tart/bitter for my tastes, but the vanilla helped add more sweetness to the orange-vanilla sorbet, which made it more palatable.Although tonight was very busy and so service was very slow, our server was very apologetic about it, and seemed genuinely distressed that he could not be more attentive - so any points lost because of how long it took to get drinks, place our order, get the check, etc. pretty much get cancelled out by the points gained by the kindness of the server and, of course, the food itself!I love that they give you madeleines with the check - we took them home to eat later and they were amazing!  Lastly, I really loved the look and feel - the overall ambiance - of Cocotte.

It was refreshing whiskey drink with strawberry. I ordered the biscuits, aged smoked gouda mac & cheese, and the fried chicken sliders.I enjoyed everything I ordered. My favorite item I ordered was my fried chicken sliders. There was definitely a kick there I enjoyed a lot. I wish my orders came out a little closer together.

It's interesting and very nicely done.Order two mimosas, pork belly tacos, eggs benedict, and broccoli fritatta. The mimosas were good, the pork belly tacos were really good as well. It comes as an order of two, and there is a lot of condiments on top of the pork, all adding to the taste.And then we sat for about 20 minutes, and asked our waitress to check on the rest of our order. Then we sit for another 20 minutes, and I see three other tables seated 15-20 minutes after us get their benedict, pizzas, you name it.At this point I'm not even hungry anymore and just ask our waitress(who was quite nice) for the check. She says her manager is coming. He comes and asks what's wrong. Probably not the best time to ask since I went on a 2 minute rant as to what the problem is.

The d√©cor is continued inside with di, red lighting, lots of Buddhas, Chinese newspaper wallpaper, and candles all about.  I can't speak to the authenticity of the decorations, but, for me, they created an enjoyable ambiance.To start we tried the Lion's Head Meatball steamed buns and the Egg Drop and Wonton soups.  The soups were alright, but not fantastic.  They seemed to be missing a little something, I'd probably forego them in the future.  As for the steamed buns, I was expected more of an enclosed steamed pork bun situation like I would get at dim sum.  These were more  folded buns with meat filling.  The flavor was interesting, and I enjoyed them.  You get 3 on the plate.  I'm definitely curious to try some of the other flavors.For entrees we got the Honey Shrimp and the Cashew Chicken, both were delicious!  The honey shrimp seemed lightly fried and coated in a citrusy sweet honey sauce that was amazing.  The cashew chicken was cooked perfectly.  It had a smoky grilled taste with a light sauce, a good about of veggies mixed in, and cashews that were cooked to a softened perfection (no overly crunchy pieces here!).  Both dishes came with a bowl of rice and each was probably enough to feed two people (at least after soup and steamed buns).We were filled to the brim and had enough left over for dinner the next night.  The menu prices are more than you'll find at other takeout Chinese places in the area, but the portions are generous and the entrees are a step above anything else I've tried locally.  Splurge a little bit and treat yourself to a meal here, you're in for a treat.Oh and I almost forgot, they bring fried wontons to the table with their house made duck sauce.  I think they have the best duck sauce I've ever tasted.  It has fresh chunks of pineapple in it, delicious!I should also say the drink menu seemed excellent.  They have some fun looking cocktails on the menu plus the well-loved scorpion bowl.  I haven't tried their drinks here, YET, but I'm sure I will.As for service, the restaurant was not too crowded when I went, it's still on the newer side and it seems word is still spreading.  Our server seemed new, but he was very attentive.  He checked in often to see how we were doing but wasn't overly pestering, and he was helpful when we had questions about the menu.  And when we asked to have our leftovers boxed he gave us fresh rice instead of boxing the remains of what we had left in the bowls.  The owner/manager was also there and stopped by our table to see how everything was.

Unfortunately, my man decided to skip the fried chicken in favor of another entree (see below), which is why South City only got 4 stars from me. Guess we'll have to go back to Atlanta again to try for that extra fried star.The highlight for both of us that evening were our appetizers: the chicken livers and trout dip were both exceptionally good. Chicken livers might not be everyone's cup of tea (the garlic jus was outstanding), but even if you think trout dip is not your thing, give it a whirl. I didn't know what the heck was in \\"holy trinity relish\\" before we ordered, but the extra crunch definitely made the dish.For a place with great fried chicken, I figured that the shrimp and grits would have to be good, and I was right. The shrimp was spicy and smokey, and I've gotta hand it to myself for picking the collard kimchi is a side because that was the ultimate winning combination. Seriously, go there and get that and try to tell me that I'm wrong. The collards gave more of a toothy bite than your typical kimchi and were definitely worth giving a shot, especially if you're a Korean food junkie like me. Unfortunately, the boyfriend's short rib fell seriously short. Not much flavor and just nothing really special there. The side of bok choi and carrots was similar. The atmosphere was warm, and the service was kind and attentive, which definitely made up for the small disappointment.

Not only that, but my wife and I like Franklin so much that we had our rehearsal dinner here despite their limited capacity. Everybody loved the food so much, that it is still all we hear about when we visit our family in Memphis. Franklin succeeded in making converts out of some die-hard pork BBQ Memphians.

I'm a firm believer that the less you specialize in (sushi or burgers), the better you are at that  specific thing.  This place proved me wrong.  First off we had the blackened tuna nachos.  Lightly seared tuna with crab rangoon dip, avocado salsa, and tomatoes.  The tuna was perfect. The flavors blended perfectly.  For main course I had the DION'S OMG! ROLL and spicy tuna roll.  Now one would expect the fancy roll to completely stand out, and it did, but the tuna in the spicy tuna roll melted in your mouth!  Seriously good.  My husband got the Texas Longhorn burger and loved it.  For drinks we got buffalo bacon, bourbon smash, and backyard brew.  All had lovely flavors, and the alcohol flavor wasn't over powering.  These drinks were mixed correctly.  Lastly for dessert we shared a PB&J milkshake.  First, I love milkshakes.  Second, too many places can't make a decent milkshake.  Its either too stiff or too runny, but not cowfish, it was perfect.  Like shakeshack perfect.  Lastly the service was impeccable.  We had Brian as our server, he was lovely and attentive.

I also love that they offer a surprise flight - fun! We also ordered some snacks to accompany the wine. The popcorn is an absolute must! It's so flavorful and served in a nice big bowl. It's drizzled in olive oil with fresh herbs and pecorino. We also got a whipped ricotta dip that had caramelized apples, fried sage, and a lovely smoked honey on top.

The menu was a great combination of taste and texture. We started with a refreshing summer squash soup and fabulous shaved vegetable salad tossed with maytag blue cheese. Both delicious. The uber standouts were the blue corn/lobster hushpuppies and the elk/foie gras sliders - both were impeccable. The garlic stuffed beef tenderloin was also deliciously noteworthy, it was served with grilled asparagus which was perfectly prepared. Also the crispy-skin bass was outstanding and was served with a side dish as well - baby veggies tossed in a citrusy olive oil. There are several special craft cocktails offered, plus an extensive wine list. I had a special tequila mixed with orange slices and cherries, perfect for a hot summer evening.

We were hungry, almost hangry because we only ate breakfast in the morning and saving our appetite for this well acclaimed restaurant. Well worth the one hour wait, but should have came earlier! Otherwise, it was nice to walk around the hawthorne district area. Due to my hangry-ness, I refused to share with my husband and try another dish - thinking that the portions were only enough for one person who already ate lunch. The fried chicken hands down was delicious! I still think about the crunchy, crispy outer layer. However, unless you can handle eating two HUMONGOUS pieces of crunchy chicken goodness, I would recommend sharing it and trying another dish (especially if you're only visiting PDX). In retrospect, I should not have been so greedy and gotten the brisket to share. That was one regret I had since I didn't foresee the portions being that beastly, though my husband and I were both very happy having our own fried chicken plates.

After having a conversation with a cooking professional, I was encouraged to write this because the owners of this establishment would want to know about a food poisoning experience. We dined on Friday, April 24, 2015.First, I must say our server, Kathleen, was absolutely delightful and attentive throughout our meal. Of course, she has nothing to do with food preparation. As far as the food, if you enjoy tapas style plates comprised with lots of edible garnishes, you might enjoy this very noisy establishment. Call it vibrant. Call the menu as having colorful names for throwaway animal parts that I would not usually think to eat. It also has several non-animal items from which to choose. I did like one or two items. The dessert was outstanding. I do not understand how they arrived at calling this \\"American (Traditional)\\" food. The menu doesn't speak that at all. The food presentation was difficult to appreciate because we were seated at a table near the bar where it was almost too dim to even read the menu let alone distinguish colors on our plates.We ordered five plates from the extravagant menu (that's code for: Who eats this?) We chose not to order fried chicken hearts. I'll tell you what we ordered and which of the items I did not eat, but which apparently caused my dinner companion to get violently ill a short time after we arrived home from the restaurant. He presented all the classic symptoms of food poisoning and it wasn't pleasant.Grilled Baby Bok Choy: This was literally incinerated to ashes except for the bulbous base, served with a nearly raw over-easy egg, which my companion ate and I did not. The plate was strewn with black charred bok choy leaves and was practically inedible.New York Strip (8 oz.) steak: Was served already sliced. Not a bad cut, but lots of fat and less meat than I had hoped for. I ate this without getting sick.Fried Baby Octopus: I did not eat. My companion ate it and enjoyed it. It was black and gray.Pork Belly: This was frightening. A large chunk of something that looks like what you find floating in the pork 'n beans can, but the size of a brownie. Pale, glutinous, fat, served with some pork cracklin' that was so hard I couldn't bite through it, so I didn't share this after taking a very small nibble of the big fat chunk thing.Smoked Char: This was a delicious appetizer (which I don't see online now), but it was bursting with complex flavors of smoked fish served on top of bread or toast that had a sweet taste. It was a rich combination of flavors.Can't Recall the Name: This also isn't found online, but it was a pastry shaped similar to a cinnamon roll, but topped with cheese. I enjoy it. I always enjoy pastry of any kind.Smoked Chocolate Bread Pudding: This dessert was served in a cast iron square plate and was heated up on the grill. I am a bread pudding foodie. This was the best. The texture was firm, but still soft enough to eat easily with a spoon. There was plenty of semi-sweet chocolate flavor and the scoop of mocha ice cream on top helped to balance it out with a touch more sweetness. I am very finicky about bread pudding. Most restaurants don't get it right. This was the best I've had in years. Delicious.I had thought we had ended on a high note with the dessert. That was until we got home and my companion became ill. There wasn't any flu going around our circle and it only lasted the night, so it was easy to diagnose as food poisoning. I still recall our pleasant server who helped make an exotic dining experience happy and upbeat.I realize there are myriad ways food can become toxic. Based on the somewhat rushed appearance and preparation of our food, and given how busy the restaurant was even at our early dining time of 7:00 P.M., there is room for carelessness, although one never knows what a supplier might bring to the table too. I realize this restaurant has gained quite a reputation. It just goes to show there's always a risk in dining out, no matter how food-forward the establishment.Overall, I found this restaurant to be too noisy, too dark, and the food not a good value for the price. I was also very sorry that my dear friend became ill after treating me to this meal on my birthday."},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"If you like coconut cream pie,  this place is a must!

I genuinely don't get it.  The butter chicken is comprised of a canned tomato soup, a ladle of cream, some Indian spice with a few chunks of dry chicken breast.  The dahl, easily the cheapest thing to cook in an Indian restaurant, was 20% lentils, 80% shitty creamy sauce.  The 'naan' bread is just thin white bread, more akin to a greek pita than an Indian flatbread.

We went when this place first opened and decided that the pizzas were a little too small for the price (compared to other places) and that they were kind of stingy when you wanted toppings the way you want. We decided back then to cross off Mod Pizza from our list of places to go out to eat.Today we chose to give it one more try and each ordered their regular 11\\" build your own. We still had to play the \\"more, more, more\\" game when it came to toppings. The staff shouldn't be so tight-fisted with the toppings. You'd think that they were paying for the stuff themselves.Our food came quickly enough, and the people were pleasant enough, but the food just isn't good enough to bring me back. About halfway through your first piece all you can taste is salt. All-in-all, just crumby pizza. Two stars because the place is clean and the staff pleasant.

First thing: the only sign is right on the front of the building, so you can probably expect to drive past it. Next: the floors here are slippery and buckling like there is a water leak or something. The floor is made out of the lowest quality wood laminate flooring I've ever seen, and has a fake wood grain that makes it slippery. It's almost like this location was opened in a hurry and without a lot of planning. The walls are bare compared to the other location and the whole vibe is different. It was pretty empty in here at 9 PM on a Saturday. My drink was supposed to have lemonade and 7 up in it (ride the lightning $6) but instead it seemed like a glass of liquor with some ice in it. It was undrinkable. The other people in my party thought it was a glass of water. There doesn't seem to be a consistent dress code, so it's hard to tell who is a server and who isn't, especially since the servers and hostess were sitting at the bar the whole time. The food was not up to the same standard as the downtown location. Just because this is the west side, doesn't mean that people don't expect a certain quality of food and a certain vibe. The whole experience was pretty unacceptable and I love me some dirty franks. Someone in our dining party (7 of us) compared the taste of the chili on their chili dog to paper. Yes, paper. The root beer floats ($6) were halfway full and absolutely not worth the price. I think that if some changes aren't made, this place won't be able to last. perk up the interior, the staff, the food, and then let me know. I'll be willing to give it another shot.I'm not hating on the location of this spot, I actually work on the west side, so I spend A LOT of time in this area and I love it, but I think it could be a lot better than it is. I'm not expecting it to be Cameron Mitchell, I realize that it's just hot dogs, but I don't want to be left with the feeling that I should have just taken my friends from out of town to McDonald's instead."},{"name":"Aria","address":"490 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've lived in Atlanta for 2.5 years now and have been wanting to get to Aria for a while and we finally did to celebrate an fun occasion with family & friends.

One of my friends is good pals with the proprietor/head chef and we were greeted by him and sent an opening course of the soup-- which was amazing. We all then ordered appetizers, I had the fried squash blossom filled with riccota on a beautiful salad. My friend had the foie and it was insane. \\nFor my main course I had the halibut that was a beautiful piece of fish-- prepared perfectly in a lovely broth. Others enjoyed the scallops and spare rib and raved about them both. For dessert we all split the warm cheescake, the espresso chocolate cake, the peach tart and the panna cotta. They were all stunning with the cheescake taking the favorite of the table. The first course was paired with an amazing champagne that we ordered from the menu and the remainder was paired with a perfect 2003 Alex Gambal red that we brought.

We upgraded to vip which was well worth it and didnt cost too much extra as we had $10 off tickets from a coupon book. The VIP gets you into a vip lounge where you can watch the start of the show in comfort before you are allowed in to the main part as they put on a gypsy show at the start. You get a private bar and a appertizzer buffet with mushroom rissto shrimp salmon chicken salad and fruit. You then get front row seating and automatic involvment in tbe show if you want it though there were loads of oppurtunities for the non vips to take part. The food was great starter was a lovely salad with dressing or soup I had mushroom ravoli but my fiance had the chicken breat with pork rice and potaotes, Pudding was ice cream with chocolate drizzle and apple cobbler. During the meal you get unlimted beer, wine and soft drinks. If your a vip you get champagne as well. The adventure was exciting the ship in the middle was fantastic and everyone got a change to get involved the pirates were great and got everyone excited.

I worked in that terminal for years, long before it ever opened. Im retired now but still fly a lot and end up eating there from time to time. I was there again in late October 2015 and still nothing has changed, its a total disaster.    There are lines but the cords in the lines are always all out of whack and there is total lack of control of the line up process. Sometimes there are 2 order takers on the right, and sometimes one. When one just bails out of the position they never adjust the lines, just leave folks to fend for themselves.  At times they open an order taking position on the north side also, but that is off and on and they dont have signage for that line.    People gather in the middle to wait for their food. If you order just a drink you still wait forever. A \\"normal\\" McDonalds can easily process just a drink order, but this one cant. Your order waits for everyone else who ordered whole loads of stuff.   They pile drinks in the middle and often mess up or forget the drinks or give the wrong one.   The staff here also dont seem to have a clue how to deal with the public. For most it's probably their first job.   In all fairness, its hard to get people to go through what they need to get out here and work for what they do. It's also a very busy place and Im sure turnover is high.

We ordered them for the weird-factor (CA is not a land of fried pickles), but then we ate the whole order and had to get a second one. SO GOOD. They told me they make the batter in-house.

Sometime right before the holidays I had several friends in town and we decided to go do a little shopping along Newbury Street, despite the fact that it was raining cats and dawgs.

The space is darkly lit, but appropriate for the day and was very festively decorated. We ordered cocktails and I had the hardest time deciding what I wanted, everything looked great. I think I finally ended up with some sort of mojito. Not the best I've ever had, but decent. None of us could decide what we wanted, so for three people we split 4 plates - vegetable spring rolls, mesculan salad, roasted squash panini and a margarita pizza. All were very good, but the standout was definitely the panini: roasted squash, fresh mozzarella, pine nuts, raisins and balsamic vinegar. To. Die. For.The atmosphere was so nice and the weather outside so miserable, that we decided to camp out for a bit after our plates were cleared. It was abour 3:30 or 4pm and the restaurant was practically dead, so we didn't feel too bad doing this. We ordered a bottle of champagne and got significantly buzzed before heading back out again.

This place is about as authentic as it gets - like walking into Mexico.  However, fair warning to all gringos - this place is not affiliated with the mediocre chain restaurant of the same name.  No tex-mex can be found here.The place is split into two sides: savory and sweet.  On the sweet side, there numerous glass cases filled with Mexican pastries that I cannot begin to name. Cookies, cakes, sweet breads, empanadas, croissants, bolillos, other things stuffed with cream cheese or cajeta.  Grab a metal tray and tongs from the center island and start loading yourself up.  DELICIOUS.  I personally gravitate toward the cream cheese items.  There is also a case of homemade gelatos and fancier cakes which I have not yet tried.Especially not to be missed are the meat pastry items in the heated case at the center island.  Empanadas are filled with various meats like picadillo, ham and cheese, chicken tinga, etc.  (Tinga is my favorite!)  The puff pastry on these empanadas is fabulous - like perfection.  They also have the best kolaches I have ever personally had.  The \\"hot dog\\" component is stuffed with cheese and chiles and has the perfect balance of sweetness and spice.  On the savory side, numerous authentic food items are available that generally fit into the breakfast and lunch category.  My personal favorite is the economical $4 \\"egg sandwich\\", which is stuffed with tomato, scrambled egg, pickled jalepenos, avocado, beans, onions and topped with hot sauce and is so much food that I have to split it.  The torta chilanga is also highly recommended, adding tasty milanesa to the mix.  The tacos aren't quite as good - they are street-food style and are piled high with onions, cilantro and lime but tend to be fairly dripping in grease.  Numerous bowls of tasty aguas frescas are available nearby and should be indulged in.  All in all - pretty much the best weekend breakfast place, ever.  P.S. - This is probably not the place to bring your parents, however.

I recommend to get there before or after the heavy crowds, such as 1pm for lunch or 8pm for dinner. The restaurant is small, and they don't take reservations, so there is usually a line outside the door. When you get inside, they have counter service so you can order and pay ahead. Since it's an urban vibe, the restaurant is arranged with community seating, so that means there's a chance that you'll be sharing a table with other parties -- which I think is pretty cool and fun.The broth is a little salty for me, otherwise, it has a rich flavor and hits the spot when you're in the mood for ramen.If you're new to ramen, I think Tonkotsu Original is a good dish to start with, and then on following visits, you can venture for other dishes. When it's a hot summer month, and you're not in the mood for broth -- go for the Tsukemen dish.

Let me say I've been to my  share of dinner shows - Dixie stampede , medieval times etc . Those all pretty entertaining and decent food . Pirates just kinda fell short for me . From the other reviews I've seen this attraction can be pretty pricey - my fianc√© got our tickets discounted through our hotel & after the evening I'm sure he was happy about that haha . So here's how the evening went - they told us to arrive early for a pre show which we opted out of , we arrived 20 minutes before the actual event . As we pull in we are told it's 5 dollars for parking .. Self parking / I thought that was a little odd since at most places self parking is free & a 5 dollar fee gets you valet parking - also since this is a dinner attraction I think the parking should be part of the over all cost because it isn't cheap , but hey it's a tourist trap & were not cheapos so my fianc√© paid & we parked . As you walk up the outside looks as if it's seen it better days and could use a new coat of paint  but the pirate decor is pretty neat & adds to the theme . We noticed at check in line so my fianc√© got in line , I opted for a cigarette & the boys checked out the pirate stuff outside . After about 15 minutes he came to get me ; from what he told me the organization at the window was really poor . Walking in the front door you are then pestered for a photo op which we turned down in an effort to go in the the theater to be seated . We were escorted to our seats in the orange section towards to back of rows ( which was fine with me & my man ) as soon as we were getting settled a very anxious manager came over & told us that since we only had 4 people we had to move forward - he shoved us into another section like Cattle & we began to attempt to get comfortable again .... That would be too nice then we were asked to move down the row yet AGAIN . At this point I was really annoyed - luckily the waiter showed up & I calmed down at the thought of a lovely adult beverage :) The drinks were over priced - go figure - but my fianc√© & I were just happy to have a little liquor to get through this . Sodas are included in the meal & are ample which is a nice plus . The food was ok , nothing great or even close to the food I've had at other dinner shows . The dessert was un edible it was like a nasty apple pie , soggy & syrupy , with ice cream on top . I gave an extra star for the setting of the show , the ship is really cool & so are the lighting & sound effects . The acting is horrible as is the story line - but his kids enjoyed it & that was all that mattered after all . The audience involvement in the show is pretty cool , each colored section has it's own pirate you root for . Although if you're not sitting close you'll probably miss out , as his kids didn't get picked for anything  . I'd say if you have younger children they might enjoy the show but all in all we weren't impressed :/ .  I'm being nice with the extra star because the decor was pretty neat We agreed next time we'd go to medieval times - it's wayyyy better all around !Management : seriously the 5 dollar parking ??

The menu is maybe ten items long if you aren't counting half and full slabs as separate things. Ribs are just saucy enough, and the sauce on the side is excellent for dipping. Macncheese is great and gooey and my kids love it. Potato salad is excellent as well, and even tastes good to a mid-westerner brought up on the real stuff. Staff knows us by sight now and is super helpful with the kids when they show up (although, to be fair, a four year old dancing on her chair with a rib in her hand and sauce all over her face is hard not to love). The music is also good, but I'm not a music critic, so I just know it works well.I'm from KC, and we're picky about our ribs when we get out to other places, but I've been taking people here for years.

Certainly the best 'nice' Chinese place in the area, and a particularly wonderful option for folks who can't decide between Japanese and Chinese on a particular night (usually how we end up here). On busier nights, it can definitely get noisy, and the service does get noticeably slower; and the prices seem a bit high relative to their portions; however, it usually feels worth it for consistently good food and a casual environment that's always clean and seldom has a line at the door. On weekends, err on the safe side and call ahead.

El Nutri was the first restaurant I tried when I visited Portland for the first time a few years ago.  Since then they've moved out of a truck, into a proper restaurant, and opened two more trucks.  The quality has only gotten better.  Vegan burritos are the best, I've now tried them all.  Had the Gigante this time and was pleasantly surprised.  Chencho's sauce is amazing.  Everything is super vegan veg friendly and the location is probably the best of all three.

Good thing we only waited 30 minutes. We ordered the fried chicken/waffles and the praline bacon waffle. I took a bite of the chicken and it was over seasoned. Gross. There was so much pepper and salt it was hard to eat. I had to order their mushroom gravy (now that was delish) to make it edible. The chicken wasn't even juicy but it was cooked thoroughly. Over seasoning aside, I've definitely have had better fried chicken (there's is just a fancy country fried chicken so don't know what the fuss is all about) from local diners. The waffles were just OK. The praline bacon was awesome though and I would go back for that. Other than, I think Roscoe's still has better chicken and waffles so if you are ever in LA go there so you know how that dish should really taste like (or go to the south for a authentic experience).

I'm not sure what's going on with this location but over the last several months the service has been inconsistent. More recently, I pre-ordered (3 days before) a birthday box of 18 for a friend's birthday dinner. I happened to drive by the day before pick up and noticed they were closed during normal business hours with no sign on the door and worried that this may impact my plans. On the day of pick up I called several times throughout the day to see if they were open and there was no answer, it went straight to voicemail. Assuming I was just being paranoid, I showed up at the time of pick up and they didn't have the order ready - said it had been overlooked and would take time to put together. I was on a tight schedule and asked if they could even change the flavors if it would mean a quicker resolution. The person who helped me was calm and said he wasn't sure why they had been closed or why it was overlooked and said their phones had been down. While I appreciated that they got me out the door in enough time to make it to the dinner on time, it all felt very lackadaisical. They also couldn't make change. While they were assisting me two customers walked in and walked out. Hope the last few months are an outlier because we love supporting local businesses especially those who have stood the test of time in an ever changing Austin."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"5 Cambridge Ctr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Clover is fantastic.

We ordered the chips and 3 cheese dip, charred broccoli, Fingerling potatoes, corn fritters, beet salad, cesear salad and another salad.  Overall the food was great.

I got the pasta dish with some kind of vodka sauce and yes it was pretty good but their margarita pizza was quiet average (which was shame be it looked so good). My husband ordered a pasta dish with mussels (sorry, I don't memorize name of dishes) and it wasn't all that good. It was very disappointing bc appetizer started to yummy. The worst part of all was dessert. We got 2 different desserts, cheesecake and the chocolate one and I have to say, pls don't order desserts here. I think what made the meal worst of all was the service. Seriously they need to hire more servers who can check in more.

I love southern food and I could get into calling people sir and ma'am.

The place was pretty lively when we came on Saturday afternoon for lunch. The bf got a beer and I ordered an Arnold Palmer (half lemonade half ice tea) and it was really good. It wasn't too sweet but still really good. For our entrees I ordered the Fried Chicken Platter my sides were collard greens and rice beans. This was probably the best fried chicken I have ever had. The skin was crispy while the meat was juicy and the pieces were huge. I liked the collard greens they were smokey and yet sweet, the rice and beans were good but not memorable and while I liked the cake texture of the cornbread, it was cold and would have loved them to have warmed it up before serving.  My bf the Soulfire Platter with Spare Ribs and Brisket. He definitely had a lot of food to tackle with this order, I tried both the brisket and the spare ribs and the meat was very tender and with any of the barbecue sauces they had on the table was delicious.

The food is pretty good as far as Italian goes in Atlanta.  It supplanted Rocky's Pizza as my go to option after Rocky's close, when craving my ancestral food and when I am too lazy to cook it myself.  The sauce is a bit sweet for my liking but that seems to be appeal to the masses.  I am also not a fan of the garlic knot rolls as they are super duper messy but again the masses have spoken on that one.  The portions are generous and the chicken parm is a mainstay for me.  The antipasto salads are also solid as are the desserts.  The pizza is pretty good as well but again it is tough to compare to Grandma Lucido's pizza.  Am I a bit biased....of course I am because no one cooks better than Grandma and Dad but if you are close to Northlake and need to feed that craving this is a good place to rely on for Italian food.

It's comforting and romantic in a way.Everything was delicious, minus the bread & butter. The bread was cold and chewy in a bad way. Although the butter was whipped, it was also cold and hard to spread. They should serve the bread warmed and the butter more of a room temperature.We had the Petrale Sole Parmesan (a lot of food), Seafood Newburg (a perfect amount of food), and the Crawfish Boil. My boyfriend was reluctant to order the Crawfish because he lived in Louisiana for years and thought it would not compare. We were all pleasantly surprised, although some of the crawfish were not edible (ie. the tail meat was mushy - which is to be avoided).The crawfish are different here than in Louisiana. They have spikes on the edges of their tail underside, which was a shock when I poked myself accidentally.Best part of the meal was the lobster cream sauce mixed with the rice.The bar area seemed to be less busy for drinking/dining, but more high traffic for entering guests. It's also decorated a bit differently and isn't as private.I love seafood, so I loved our meal, but I'm not going to say it's the best seafood I've had.

We started with an order of the duck pate, and were very surprised at the portion... it was huge - like a large ice cream scoop!  The pate was nicely seasoned and paired well with the bread that came with the dish as well as the assortment of breads (especially the olive one!) that were brought to the table.Most of us ordered tartines (one tuna, one chicken salad, and one brie with preserves) - YUM.  I ate the tuna tartine and was pleasantly surprised that there was no mayo in the tuna which can sometimes be overwhelming.  Instead, the tuna was lightly prepared with a little olive oil, capers, sun dried tomatoes and white beans.  The chicken salad was definitely prepared with mayo (but i think chicken salad typically needs it) and was topped with dried cranberries - I barely even got a bite of it since my husband ate it so quickly!  The tartine with brie and preserves was definitely the richest - but we all loved it.The lone non-tartine diner had a bagel with smashed avocado (preparation suggested by our waiter) and an order of the blueberry blintzes.  The smashed avocado was delicious - I have never thought of subbing out the cream cheese for nature's mayo!  The blintzes were also yummy - none of them made it into a to-go box!Servers was on point (attentive, friendly) - 5 stars for them!Their dinner menu looks amazing (but is only served after 5) and I can't wait to go back to try some items from it!"},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I have never had a cone at a festival, but I can see how this can be the perfect outdoor concert food.

I was down in Florida for a wedding and visiting my friends and family. My best friend mentioned how good The Cowfish in North Carolina was so we agreed to check this location out. We were greeted by friendly staff in what seemed to be the first week or so of operation. Our visit to The Cowfish was November 15th, 2014 at around 6 o'clock.  The wait time was about 60 minutes, which was fine since they just took my cell phone number and we walked around Citywalk while we waited. Once seated, it took a while for the server to get to us. My thought was with all the staff I saw, It seemed like we wouldn't have to wait too long for service and food. I was wrong, as it took about 10-15 minutes to get a menu. Our server, however, did go over the menu with us. My friend recommended that I go with the \\"Burgushi\\". He said when they frequented the Raleigh location, They got the \\"Prime-Time\\" Filet and Lobster Sushi Roll, and it was dynamite. I ordered an avocado roll, Parmesan Truffle Fries, and then the Filet and Lobster Sushi Roll as per their recommendation. The fries were the best part of the meal. They were hot, fresh, maybe slightly overcooked, but otherwise tasty. When the avocado roll came, the rice was under cooked and the avocado a bit too ripe. I've had better Avocado rolls at Publix.When the main course arrived, it didn't look appealing at all. The Filet was cold and the presentation left little to be desired. I ate it knowing that I was hungry but it was not very good. Again, under cooked rice and the meat didn't taste right. Sure, I could have asked to have it taken back but given the poor service and rush to seem to get patrons in and out, I decided to deal with it. My friends were very sad with there meals as well. They told me when they ordered \\"The Prime-Time\\" Filet in NC, it came out hot. This was not the case. Needless to say, we will not be frequenting The Cowfish in Orlando anytime soon.

There was a live blues band (fantastic!), the patio was FULL, and the inside only had a few tables open at any given point.  The walls are covered in crazy stuff, but it was REAL stuff and didn't feel like a Friday's or an Applebees.  My favorite was the photo hanging above the door to the kitchen (don't miss it.. there's something creepy and awesome about it!)  The atmosphere of this place alone was worth the visit.The food, on the other hand, was mixed.  The menu is fairly small, but I think the protein appeals to every person craving BBQ.  There was a pleasantly sizable number of tasty sides.  I ordered a half rack of ribs, a side of baked beans, a slice of pecan pie and a glass of lemonade (everything is a la carte).  I don't generally (ever) like baked beans, but the \\"rum\\" baked beans here were FANTASTIC.  The ribs, on the other hand, were so-so.  They were boiled, not smoked, and the cut was more of cartilage than bone (definitely not something you want to be dealing with on a date... then again, who orders ribs on a date without expecting to be getting messy?) so I was frequently surprised when I bit into the meat.  The flavor of the ribs was also lacking (due to the cooking process), so a majority of the flavor was from their BBQ Sauce.  Overall, not a set of ribs I'd ever crave again.  The pie also left some to be desired.  Having moved here recently, I was really craving some GOOD southern Pecan Pie.  The pie was a little dry, and rather bland.  Not nearly as good as my yankee mom's pecan pie.  The lemonade was FABULOUS.  Better than Chick fil a.  Overall, this was a fun place to go for a different kind of evening, but I had better BBQ working at Smokey Bones in Cincinnati.  I would return, to share the atmosphere with someone.

In fact when I mentioned that I was the DD (designated driver), the bartender told me he'd refill my soda for free if I came back to him.  Stubb's is the perfect epitome of what the Austin music scene is.And just for your amusement, my own tale of Good Karma that happened during the Feist show:My girlfriend and I (I'm 5'10, she's 5'5) were stuck behind a rather tall couple in the crowd, and couldn't see the stage very well.  As it was a sold out show, we were grateful we were as close to the stage as we were.I noticed some people move from in front of them and I tapped the tall guy on the shoulder and asked if we could squeeze in front of them to see over.  He told me that he was saving the spot for his friends but thanked me for asking instead of just shoving our way in front of him.Not 10 seconds afterwards two guys and a girl shoved their way past and stopped right in front of the tall couple.  The couple asked for them to move at first, then it quickly degenerated into an argument.  (Seriously, who gets in a fight at a FEIST concert?! That's like a mosh pit at a Norah Jones concert.)After about 5 minutes of yelling at each other, the rude people left and went somewhere else.  The tall guy turned around and said \\"Did you believe that?  You were nice and asked me while these people just shoved their way past.  You can get in front of us if you like.\\"We ended up with a perfect view of the show and there was still room for their returning friends.

They give you this chicken dish with sides of pickles and raddish. As well, they give you a metal dish to put your bones in!! The soju was smooth and at a good price.Ice cream was yummy.The atmosphere is great. Good vibe with not too much noise.The girls that worked that day were great.

I didn't see her parents for at least 20-30 minutes and had no idea until someone else said she belonged to the owner of the brewery.

Most importantly, it didn't taste like it had come from some do-it-yourself Indian buffet box kit.  Everything dish and appetizer had a taste that was unique to Punjab, making it a cut above many other establishments that are hard to tell apart.  In fact, this is the finest Indian restaurant I've been to in the area, which is very surprising given its unassuming exterior and strip mall location.

I was referred to this restaurant by a man at the W Hotel. I was even staying there but I popped in there to see it and then asked him where to eat. Little did I know he sent me to the exact spot that I wanted-healthy Southern cuisine with new takes on classic dishes.   Our server, Lauren, and I'm not sure if I spelled that correctly, was exceptional. She knew the menu up-and-down, left and right.  The fried green tomatoes melted in my mouth, the biscuits were like someone's grandma was in the back.   And the saut√©ed chicken livers, wow I could go on and on but let me tell you this, I've eaten a lot of fried chicken in my life, a lot. I've limited my intake to just four times a year. The fried chicken breast was the best I ever had, and I'm not exaggerating.   Next visit to Atlanta will require a trip back to this amazing restaurant.

Their side items are a little hit or miss in my opinion.  I don't particularly care for their baked beans and the potato salad isn't my favorite.  The mac and cheese is good on occasion because they use several types of cheeses in it.  On the plus side, I've taken many people to Fat Matt's and they love the food and always have a good time.

Frankly, I'll take bay shrimp cakes over bread crumb cakes. I found myself searching for the crab part of the cake and not being very successful.

I have not had a burger here.What I have, every single time I come here, is the grilled chicken sandwich.Flatties serves up a whole breast of chicken, grilled with some spices (I imagine it is salt, pepper, and a bit of something else). Lettuce, tomato, and I add avacado. Fresh avacado. Yes, this is a 'fast food' joint. But they have avacado. YUM!Top it off with some of their condiments (fantastic relish! jalapenos! red onions! PICKLES - sliced thin! YUM!) They have an array. Since food is really just a vehicle for condiments, go forth and top your sandwich/burger/fries. Enjoy.You can sit at the 'bar' (counter?) and watch the Flatties peeps cook your food fresh for you. I like knowing that my food hasn't been sitting waiting for me for a long time. The other thing, which I think is fantastic, is that they are constantly cleaning this place. There has not been one occasion I can think of where I did not see at least one person scrubbing, washing, or drying something off. OCD me loves cleanliness. You should too.Flatties is also cheap! They even raised their prices in the recent past (within the last year) but I think the sandwich (sans avacado) is still under four bucks.

The corn, maple, and shishito pepper flavors worked really well together, plus there was popcorn on top. You can't beat popcorn.\\n-Sweet pea & peanut hummus: There was surprisingly little of the hummus itself on the plate, but it harmonized really well with the gooey egg and the bacon jam (yes, bacon jam) around it. and the bread that came with it was crusty, soft, and freshly grilled.\\n-Fried smelts: I'm not a fan of these myself, but it came with thin slices of lemon that were also battered and fried, which were awesome.\\n-Crispy pork belly: I didn't have this, but my friends raved about it.\\n-Chicken fried rabbit: Ditto above.\\n-Chips and onion dip: Pretty standard, but great for what it was.\\n-Smoked bread pudding: This was the only unpleasant surprise of the night, and wasn't enough to knock it down to 4 stars.

Hubs thought it had a sweet-ish flavor, I just thought it dry.I consistently enjoy the mac and cheese (creamy) and Frito pie is a favorite.  Hubs generally enjoys the baked beans without complaint.  Collards often lean to spicy; I haven't had the Brunswick stew lately, but the last time they were trying something new (potato chunks? really?) and it was not good enough to have again.  Potato salad is too mustardy for my taste.  Also, they sell the BBQ sauce by the bottle, which is worth taking home.So yeah - I'll continue eating there.

Interesting how the resto is split between a casual light bright dining room and bar and a darker more serious club room style dining room and bar. Choices!!\\nWe have been for brunch which was ok. And most recently for drinks and desserts. \\nBrunch was in the casual area and it was nice but nothing to rave about. \\nDrinks and dessert the other night (after a great dinner at Tiger Mamma )were disappointing at best. \\nSat night at 10 and both areas were not full. \\nThe club room felt more cozy so we opted for that. \\nThe room was nice but the very tipsy \\"regulars\\" at the bar were screeching like little girls with the bar tender and the issue is they were 47 yr old men!!\\nUgh. Nothing I love more than inebriated screechy middle age men who have no idea how annoying they are to others around them. \\nA nice young man came to tell us all the things they were \\"out of\\" and left us with drink/dessert menus. \\nThe waitress never came to take a drink order so I had to order myself at the bar and return to my party at our table. Normally I wouldn't care but really the place was empty. The bartender was surprised and apologized but the waitress was still involved in her private conversation with yet again, other regulars. \\nShe finally came to take an order and was surprised we had already taken care of that. No apologies or explanation. The dessert options were odd and not enticing and this is from one who would be happy with a plate of cookies to the most decadent dessert on earth. Neither was available. We decided to pass. \\nOnce the waitress realized we were a one drink each party we were no longer interesting or worth her time so the bill was brought and we were let know that it was time to settle up. Not so many words but I've been around long enough to be fluent in \\"bad attitude \\". \\nOn the whole we have not been WOWed by Tapestry. \\nToo many great joints in town to frequent. \\nWe wish them luck."},{"name":"Nelore Churrascaria","address":"115 E Lyman Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"If you like Brazilian steakhouses you'll like this place.

And going there totally did not disappoint.Let's get this straight:  Dirty Frank's is a dive.  But it's the best kind of dive, with lots of character, good food, and cheap prices.As you might imagine, Dirty Frank's specializes in hot dogs.  Their wieners are all beef, but they also feature optional bratwurst, vegan dogs (*shakes head*), and even bacon-wrapped hot dogs at a slight upcharge.  The variation comes in their numerous toppings, which can be added a la carte or through their numerous named dogs, such as my choice, the \\"Whoa Nellie!\\" (featuring brisket and bbq sauce) or Jules' favorite, the \\"Seoul Dog\\" (which came with kimchi, sriracha, and mayo).  Further, Dirty Frank's offers quite a few mixed drinks, mainly of the frozen varieties.  I was the DD for the evening, so I only indulged in a normal lime slush, but Jules, Pam, and Jeff all enjoyed various frozen boozy delights, which somewhat set the pace for our evening.One minor note of disappointment were the tater tots.  Offered as a 'homestyle' side designed to take you back to your childhood, they seemed like a good choice.  Ours, though, were fairly unseasoned and bland.

Their beef brisket and catfish are my absolute favorite and the way they make their mashed potatoes with gravy, the potato salad, or the coleslaw is pure art. \\nThe fact that all the produce used is from local farms makes the food so much more enjoyable because you're eating natures finest. \\nLong story short, the Screen Door is a monthly must for me to get my fix. \\nNow go get yours!!!! ;)"},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Good place! Not 5 stars because it's always crowded and the prices are a tad high. They have this specialty corn drink that is phenomenal (or at least they did 1 year ago last time I was there). Definitely worth checking out while in Cambridge!"},{"name":"Lonesome Dove Western Bistro","address":"419 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is amazing here, every bite!\\nIt is creative without getting overly fancy.\\nGreat drink list.\\nWait staff was attentive but not in the way.\\nIt is a stunning space.

They have plenty of well-priced tequilas too if you are into sipping the fine stuff. Chinacos Reposado = :). There used to be a bar/lounge next door, 28 degrees (maybe?), and it had a very chill, polished but low-key un-Boston vibe to it. I'm not sure what happened to the place but it hasn't been there for a while now. Masa keeps that chill atmosphere going and like other \\"similar\\" neighborhood gems (DBar- DOT for ex:) their music selection is often on-point. Come here after work, bring some friends, sit at a high-top and cock-a-few-tails at this oft-forgotten corner of Yupville. You won't regret it.
