Obviously others really like the donuts from blue star so our 2 star rating shouldn't be the reason you don't try it. Keep in mind that we are very adventurous eaters and usually we love weird, out of the ordinary foods. I will say the donuts weren't like anything we have ever eaten before. We didn't like the way they tasted because they were very lemony, very greasy (they left grease stains on everything they touched) and just didn't have the typical donut taste. After eating them I was very disappointed because they had such amazing Yelp reviews from so many people... I expected them to be life changing. As I read more, I realized that they were healthy alternatives to regular donuts as well as cruelty free and gluten free. After knowing that I bumped up my rating from 1 star to 2. The place was super cute and clean, the people were very nice and service was very quick. We got our donuts 30 seconds after we ordered them (on a Thursday morning around 8 am) honestly I still encourage people to try blue star because you either hate it or love it.

Rialto consists of prosciutto, arugula, and buffalo mozz with a salad on the side while the meatball has a unique chipotle/pepper jack twist and also comes with a salad. Sandwiches are definitely well-sized and filling; however, the pricing is a little high around ~13 each.

My requirements were that it had to be vegetarian-friendly and very bland because he's a wimp and doesn't like spices. Although I'm a huge fan of spicy foods, probably because all the smoking has dulled my taste buds.\\n\\nThe people who work here are polite and SO QUIET! I was whispering because I didn't want to look like the ass talking loudly about being drunk or doing it or something. And my table was really, strangely sticky. I touched the surrounding tables to see if maybe it's the lacquer or something and other patrons were looking at me weird cause I guess you're not supposed to touch other tables or something.\\n\\nWe started off with the uh... the #1 [as I ordered it] which is some sort of mashed potato filled pocket that's fried. I ate it with both of the sauces--the mild one which my BF liked [natch] and the hot one which I thought wasn't hot enough. It was okay, but very bland.\\n\\nI'm stupid and for whatever reason, I ordered the chicken curry. I was pissed off as soon as I ordered it, but it was too late. I wanted a more \\"traditional\\" Tibetan food. I've gone to Chi-Chi's and on several occasions, I've ordered the hot dog, but I was 10 years old then. I've always been bad at ordering the right food. He got some tofu/watercress dish which was floating in some sort of oily pool of red. The menu didn't mention that there were onions and tomatoes [two things he hates] so he told the server who promptly took his plate away and brought him a steaming new plate sans tomatoes/onions within eight minutes. Nice!\\n\\nThe decor is pretty lame. The GIGANTIC poster of some mountains is okay, but the whole thing had bubbles on it. If you're going to have a restaurant, and hang something on the wall, it's a good idea to have a nice print that's smoothed down, and use a squeegee fer chrissakes! Unless you're TGI Fridays with your things on the wall hung slightly askew, just get a freaking gay guy to help you out with the steeze. And the salt and pepper shakers are like the ones the Pizza Hut puts their Parmesan cheese and pepper flakes in.\\n\\nYou really need to flag the servers down if you need something or want to leave the place. I don't know if it's over politeness or neglect. I'm going to go for the former. I paid with a credit card and got the world's tiniest stamp-size receipt.\\n\\nAs we left, he was satisfied and happy.

There were at least 5 types of veggies in there. The brown rice was also perfectly cooked. GIANT portion (even it it is brown rice, lots of calories there..). Portions of everything are gigantic it would seem, just looking at others orders. \\n\\nBecause I didn't order a meat entree, the friendly woman behind the counter said I could select a salad. I went with the spinach pasta thing, which I would rate as just ok.

Although I've occasionally eaten here for Sunday lunches, I found much of the food last night to be either old (dried out from earlier in the day), lacking flavor, or simply not made right (grainy broccoli cheese soup, for instance).  The cake sitting out when we got there tasted bad and the one they replaced it with was burnt all around the bottom.  Not everything about the food was bad, but the quality was definitely a lot lower than previous experiences.\\n\\nMy real problem with the meal, however, involves the price of the meals and how I feel Sweet Tomatoes purposely overprices (with supplemental coupons for those in the know) or has alternative interests in mind.  Here's the just of last night's pricing experience.  When I made it to the register I was told that my dinner couldn't apply to the school fundraiser if we were going to use Club Veg coupons so I had to make a quick decision.  I chose the coupon option, which meant no fundraiser participation, because the price of dinner was then going to be much more than planned.  Although I soon realized that the fundraiser flyer we had may have mentioned this in the illegible fine print at the bottom, a deeper look at how Sweet Tomatoes supports such fundraisers is bothersome.  The bill I paid was ~$29 using the same weekly coupons every member of the free Club Veg email club gets.  If I'd paid full menu price, It'd be ~$50 for the same food and Sweet Tomatoes would be \\"donating\\" ~$7.50 of that to my daughter's school.  The way I calculate this situation, Sweet Tomatoes approach to fundraising is to pull in customers with this seemingly community-friendly advertisement while actually making more money for themselves (trying to net ~$13.50 over the coupon sale in my case).  It would make much better sense that I simply donate the remaining $21 to the school and avoid the restaurant in the future.  The situation simply didn't sit right with my wife and I so I felt the need to explain it here.

It was highly recommended from an esteemed friend and it is within walking distance of my place.  However, it was very disappointing.  Make that very, very disappointing - to the point of an hour later wishing I hadn't ate there.  Here's the story.\\n\\nStopped by last night for dinner on a beautiful evening. I loved the look of the place, if you didn't know better, you might think this place had been here for 50 years.  Great job setting the space up, easy access, really big patio out front.\\n\\nFirst, they let you scoop your own sides, which there is a nice selection of.  A few of them, like pecan pie and cornbread are an extra charge, but there was a worker who nicely explained how it all worked.  I grabbed some mac and cheese and some coleslaw, the SO tried the green beans also.  All were pretty good.  They definitely earn a star for their selection of sides!\\n\\nNow onto the main course, we ordered brisket, pork ribs, and jalapeno sausage.  The sausage was underwhelming.  Barely any jalapeno flavor, and some odd cheese stuck in the middle of it.  They could have at least had the sausage warm enough to melt the cheese, but it was solid.  I thought the outer casing was too tough for my liking.  Definitely a below average jalapeno sausage.  I won't order that again.\\n\\nThen I tried the pork rib. The meat actually fell off the bone when I tried to pick up the rib.  not a good sign, clearly overcooked.  Though, there was a decent amount of meat on each rib, I ended up eating it like pulled pork, which it essentially was.  I give the ribs an average rating.\\n\\nNext was the grand finale, the brisket, the most prized edible of Texas BBQ.  It had a nice looking peppery crust.  Looked good (sorry, didn't snap any pics).  However, it was way too fatty.  There was a good 3/4 to 1 inch layer of fat across the whole top.  Now, I don't mind fat on my brisket, but 1/3 of the slice was fat.  Trimming that off also took off a lot of that nice peppery crust.  And, the taste was awful.  It was way overcooked!  The texture was almost like mush in your mouth.   The SO disliked it so much she couldn't even finish hers. I regretted it later, but I finished the brisket.  I've never been to a place in Texas that had such bad brisket.  Seriously overcooked, bad bad bad. And to add insult to injury, it didn't really have much smoke flavor.\\n\\nAs for the bbq sauces, I could barely discern a difference between the original, sweet, and spicy.  The only sauce I found worth eating was their branded hot sauce, which improved the spicy bbq sauce considerably by mixing it in (1:1 ratio was good).\\n\\nFrom the pics on here of others' brisket, I am guessing that I went on an unfortunate night as others' look to be better cooked than what we had.  Maybe they have some consistency issues? I don't know, but considering they are only two blocks away from home, I might give them another try once the memory of the mushy brisket fades."},{"name":"Coast Restaurant","address":"1054 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I took my mom here for her birthday and I had such high expectations because they are part of the Glowbal group, but I was quite disappointed. I had mad reservations for the three of us, and when I had called an hour before we were due to dine asking if we could come in 30 mins earlier, it sounded like they lost our reservation. That was kind of annoying, and I believe that they had lost it as well because our table wasn't set when we arrived and I was told that we took part of a table that was a 9 top that didn't show up.. What if they had shown up? Then we wouldn't have had a table even if we had arrived when we were supposed to arrive. What was even more disappointing was that the person who took my reservation even asked if we were dining for a special occasion and I had said that it was for my moms birthday, but when we paid up, my mom told our server that it was her birthday and she sounded surprised. Which pretty much confirms that our reservation was lost. \\nFood: We ordered the calamari, ahi tuna tartare, the sockeye salmon, the seafood linguine and snow crab legs. The calamari was like wok-fried calamari - very generic, especially with it being a higher end restaurant, I expected better than that.. I've had much better calarmi elsewhere. It also tasted as though it had been swimming in oil. The tartare was quite tasty tho, but how can you go wrong with raw fish. My salmon tasted extremely bland, I had to force myself to finish most of it cause it cost $35. I must admit it looked extremely fresh though. The risotto or orzo rice that came with it was amazing tho, melted in your mouth, probably my favourite part of the meal.\\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere in the restaurant is very very nice, decor is on point - especially with the colour coordination of the furniture and the servers attire. Lighting was just perfect for me, and the music was at a good level with it being loud enough to hear but not so loud that you need to shout. The music style was hip/remixed top 40s, which was enjoyable. \\nService:  I had asked for meal to be coursed, appetizers first and entrees after but we weren't even finished our appetizers yet and they had placed our entrees in the middle as though we were sharing. (?!) And that was pretty much inexcusable for me, especially with it being fine dining, I expected much much better than that. That was basically a rookie mistake in my opinion. I'm not sure whose fault that was cause it was clear that there were many people working the floor. I could tell because all the servers were wearing the same dress and the bussers(?) were all wearing the same tie and dress shirt. (That was a nice touch, but with such a large coorporation, I expected it) Our server was quite nice but I kind of had a feeling that she didn't want to service us, either that or it was too busy in the restaurant. The restaurant was full when we had arrived. I also noticed that a table that had been seated after us had received their calamari before ours which could mean that the server took their order first, but she hadn't even come by to ask us for our order. I had to flag somebody else down to take our order before our server came back to us. \\n\\nFood: 3/5 \\nAtmosphere: 5/5\\nService: 3/5\\n\\nI still tipped her my average 20% because I'm not sure whose fault it is at this point for our poor dining experience at Coast but I don't know if I will ever be back, and I don't think I would recommend this place to anybody, it's definately was not worth the $200 price tag.

After perusing the pictures from all options, I decided on Punjab palace. Even though I'm travelling alone, I got the vegetable masala and the aloo gobi (don't judge!). I always get aloo gobi as a backup at a new restaurant because how bad can potatoes and cauliflower ever be? \\n\\nI was in luck because both entrees were delicious! The vegetable masala had the same broth as chicken tikka masala, only it came with carrots, beans, cauliflower, peppers, etc. So much nicer than having to get heavy paneer for a vegetarian masala experience!!! There were golden raisins and cashews in the broth as well, which reminds me more of nav rattan korma, but the sweetness melded beautifully with the carrots, so I don't mind. The aloo gobi was special! It's never bad, but their cauliflower had a smoky grilled taste and lots of turmeric that made for a bright, grilled finish to a sometimes lackluster dish.\\n\\nI ordered delivery through YELP EAT 24 and the order came early, the driver heeded my special request to call, and he was awesome!

Some of you may be familiar with the characteristic shenanigans of such an institution. I'm still recovering. One of my fondest memories involves lunchtime. Seniors (8th graders) were really important people, and when it was our turn to be at the top of the food chain we were given the privilege... of... helping in the kitchen at lunch. Four lucky eighth-graders left class 30 minutes early, proudly donned aprons, and helped get lunch going. We were so cool, and we knew that the younger classes were as jealous of us as we'd stupidly been of our predecessors. I remember removing scalding hot plates from the industrial dishwashing machines. Through all that fun we got to eat delicacies too intricate to be prepared at my house: hotdogs with sauerkraut, fish sticks, mac & cheese, and hamburgers.\\n\\nA handful of years later: Mooyah. I picked up a call-in order between meetings. On my way back to the office, I started doing what all blessed Americans have the right to do in their cars: eat the fries*.  I was concerned I'd have to consume them without ketchup, or that I'd do something hasty and make a condiment mess in the car.  No need.  They're perfectly salted and seasoned and require no ketchup catastrophe to be delicious.  I love the tasty crispy burned bits on these skin-on fries.\\n\\nAt my desk, I set down the heart attack bag. I whipped out the foil-covered burger and thought: dang, did I accidentally get double the meat? Because this thing is huge, and I'm not sure I can handle it all. And then I unwrapped it. It was all show, little meat. Gristly meat. Catholic school meat, from 8th grade. Prepared in fact with the same little bits of onions, with a slight update on the bread. Folks, the memories came flooding in with every bite.\\n\\nShould I have eaten it? Probably not. This wasn't the most sophisticated patty I've seen recently, I can tell you.

First, this place is an Instagram nerd's wet dream. The design is quirky and perfectly in line with \\"keeping austin weird.\\" That's where the pros stop. Let's start with the name. \\"The Factory\\" conjures up images of a space where folks can get their dose of brain fuel and be productive. However, this is definitely not the case. This is a no laptops or iPad coffee house. While I somewhat understand the reason behind this policy it doesn't seem to fit into the fact that Austin is a huge university town and tech city where so many folks are looking for a place to have coffee, eat and work.  Putting that and their lack of wifi aside, the inviting atmosphere comes to a dramatic halt when you realize that you won't be speaking to an actual person when placing your order. Instead you get to enter your order into an iPad. Again, understandable from a technology/ overhead perspective. Still, this is a strange embrace of technology for a place that feels as if it's running from modern tech. \\"Your iPads aren't welcome.... but please use ours to place your order so we don't have to talk to you.\\" (Introvert friendly?)But let's move beyond and talk about the food. The selection is lacking but they do have two chicken and waffle options. I'm from the Deep South and I LOVE chicken and waffles but this version left a lot to be desired. The chicken was ok but that was only when I could find it under the globs of fried batter. The waffle was bland and had the consistency of a cheese puff. You know, edible styrofoam. I also had a sparkling tea which sounded nice and refreshing. Well, if tea flavored cream soda is your thing, drink up. My partner ordered a latte and was alarmed when he saw that adding an extra shot of expresso was $2.50. Seriously?! It's also an odd choice to serve that hot latte in a tall glass with no insulation. You couldn't pick it up for longer than 3 seconds before burning your hand. By the end of the experience I wasn't surprised that there were only three tables occupied during lunch rush hour. I was very disappointed in this place from the entire execution.

I don't eat red meat or poultry any longer  but I checked the menu and they had a vegetarian option, the shroom Burger. The tiny Shack Shake attached to Peremeter Mall was cute and quaint definitely a cool spot for my niece and I to sit and figure out what the hype was all about while we ingested our food. Inspite of the massive crowd of folks strolling in and out of the resturant  all the table tops and floors were clean and the restroom was surprisingly spotless as well. \\nThe staff was super friendly, although they were extremely busy the young lady at the counter was very patient with me being a first timer and all. My niece and I ordered the same thing, the Shroom Burger and Fries.  The Burger was a big round greasy deep fried mushroom with fixings on top. I am impressed that they have a vegetarian option but was not as impressed with the taste. There was nothing memorable about my fried mushroom burger other than the grease that filled up in my mouth when I bit into it. The fries were good, not too greasy and they were nice and hot.  Definitely not worth the value, $10 is pricey for a burger and fries.\\nI don't typically eat fast food so I gave 4 stars for the customer service, and cleanliness of the restaurant.

After the way my friends and I were treated, we are absolutely positive we will never return. They just lost 14 customers plus everyone that we are telling about our experience. Besides the fact that the service was very slow, there was a roach in my friend's iced tea, and they didn't know who ordered what and kept putting the wrong plates in front of the wrong person, it took them 4 TIMES to get our bills correct!!! We dined from 7:30-9:30pm and were held hostage while they continuously gave us bills with each other's food and drinks on it, for 45 minutes. We didn't leave until 10:15 and we were all flustered and annoyed. If they don't know how to split the checks, they should have told us so, so we could have done it ourselves.\\n\\nThe first 4 couples paid their bills and went outside the last 3 were given bills that were almost 3 times as much as they ordered. \\nThey told our server what to remove and when he came back a 2nd time it still had some of these items on the receipt. They explained exactly what they ordered, again. He then charged their credit cards for an even higher amount than the first bill and didn't bring the itemized receipts this 3rd time. I asked for the manager and when he came over, he had a rude tone and said \\"what's the matter!?\\"I explained that my friends were getting charged for items they didn't order and his response was \\"well, all the food came out to the table and it was good, right?\\" EXCUSE ME??? You're not going to apologize that my birthday dinner is being ruined because your server has zero listening skills and all my friends are annoyed and tired of being stuck at your restaurant? You're not going to comp the items they're being over charged for? You're expecting us to pay for each other's food, when some of my friends didn't even know each other and this was supposed to be a nice opportunity for them to meet, not to buy each other food? \\nI was in shock at the manager's response! He treated us like we were doing something wrong, when we chose his restaurant for a special occasion. I had to walk out before I threw a fit and started throwing plates. My friends felt very wronged. I expected an apology at the very least, we did not expect to be talked down to.

Cherrywood's staff is cool and will mix it up with you (as long as there is no line). Also, they have a beautiful place, with lots of plants outside, variable workspaces, and lots of surprises (like their delicious pies and impressive beer selection). \\n\\nBeware, though, if you are a pretty huge coffee snob, they may disappoint you a little in this region. I enjoy their fancier espresso drinks (cortadito or the cuban), but it's not the tastiest black coffee (Ruta Maya). I usually need sugar for it. But like I said... it's a workhorse place.

First, I was just so impressed by the professionalism of this restaurant.  I called and left a message for a reservation on a Saturday night.  They promptly called me back the following day and booked my reservation.  The day before my visit to Vancouver, they called again to reconfirm that I would be dinning there.  Such great follow-up.\\n\\nWe were about 7 minutes late to our dinner appointment.  I almost freaked out a little because generally, places get really busy on a weekend - Boxing Day weekend.  I really didn't want to lose our reservation since we were so hungry.  There was plenty of parking up in front.  Despite the people waiting in the front area, the restaurant hostess still kept our table reserved.  It was so nice to get to a restaurant and to be immediately seated.  Bravo on this!\\n\\nMy husband and I ordered a French Onion Soup, salmon with brussel sprouts and potatoes and a steak with fries.  There were highlights and lowlights to our meal.  What really stood out was the salmon with brussel sprouts.  It was absolutely cooked to perfection.  The salmon was crispy and buttery.  The flavors were just so rich and perfectly seasoned.  The potatoes and brussel sprouts were also great compliments to my meal.  I ate my entire entree in less than 30  minutes.  The steak and fries were okay.  The steak was cooked perfectly where the texture was medium rare.  However, the seasoning was not to par with what was described in the menu.  It tasted more like a wine sauce rather than a peppercorn sauce that was advertised. The French Onion Soup was also a semi-disappointment.  It tasted good but not great.  It was rich with thick layer of bacon.  It tasted better than what I've had in the past. I don't think this was the fault of the restaurant's though.  I think I just don't really like French Onion Soup and that they cooked a better version of it than what I expected.  I definitely will be coming back.

I feel that Ebi-Ten does what it aims to do: Japanese fast-food.\\n\\nBut don't let the phrase, \\"Japanese fast-food\\" fool you. They serve it hot and fresh, and it tastes even better than most sit-in Japanese restaurants.\\n\\nA couple days back, I dropped by this place upon recommendation from a friend. He had said, \\"yo, check out this place. The food is fast, good, and it isn't too expensive.\\" Well hey, that's incentive enough for me to pay a visit!\\n\\nAmbiance: Man, is this place busy or what? Dinner hours had just begun, and they are already lined up out the door. Needless to say, there were no seats available inside. Treat this place as a take-out joint, because honestly, the ambiance almost discourages you to stay too long. However, I think it serves its purpose.\\n\\nService: The people taking the orders were smiling and friendly. That's all I would ever expect from this place. I'm very satisfied!\\n\\nValue: These are the cheapest Japanese food that I have found, up to date. If you are looking for a deal, then this is where it's at. For a nice meal plus a pop or a large bowl of miso soup, you are charged ~8 dollars. That works for me!\\n\\nFood: The dish my friends and I had were quite good. The chicken teriyaki combo and the beef teriyaki combo were both very tasty. It's almost surprising that the meals here taste better than a lot of the Japanese restaurants around. Did I mention that these guys are fast? 3-4 minutes per order, roughly. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals.\\n\\nVerdict: Filling up that big empty void in my stomach would require more than just a few slices of sushi, and that would probably empty out my paycheck fairly quickly if I was to eat elsewhere. So I propose two possible solutions:\\n\\n1. I can try and make more money... somehow...\\n2. I can go to Ebi-Ten\\n\\nI think the choice is obvious. \\nI need to make more money.\\n\\nBut seriously, Ebi-Ten is definitely worth your visit. If you want to eat Japanese food regularly?

Before dinner we had drinks at the bar near the entrance from the hotel side. Our bartender Jared kept us entertained .What a character - great smile and gift of gab!  He really made us feel welcome and made us feel special even though the bar was full. And he sure knows how to make great drinks, some of the best we've ever had!\\n\\nFor dinner, we sat at the mozarella bar, where the lady in charge immediately offered us complimentary proscuitto. Delicious!  We all ordered different dishes, and she was able to describe them in detail. Two of my dining companions ordered chicken dishes: Hearth Braised Chicken with Apricots, Figs and Dates; Spit Roasted Heritage Chicken with Prosciutto and Lemon..Another ordered the swordfish skewer, and I ordered the lasagna \\"from the Borgia table\\". We shared portions of our entrees, and we found them all outstanding.  The chicken and swordfish were perfectly cooked, moist and tender, with wonderful depth of flavor and beautiful presentation. The lasagna was a taste revelation for me. A wonderful relief from the ubiquitous tomato sauce based versions. Portions were perfectly sized too. \\n\\nWe ordered several different wines and were especially impressed by the reds: Aglianico, Dolcetto, and Multipulciano. All were very good vintages and were served at the correct temperature, something that happens all too rarely. It's touches like this that make a great dining experience. And the service!! Our server Daniel was a true professional: very friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable about wine/ food pairings. In fact, he recommended the wines we chose. We never had to ask for water or wine refills, which were provided often without our noticing. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was warm and welcoming with beautiful lighting and low noise level, which made conversation easy.\\n\\nOverall, a great experience for a bargain price. We will definitely return."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I went here with a group of business colleagues recently and we had a great time.

With that said, the waitress was attentive and quickly comp'd our appetizers to make up for it.  \\n\\nThe food is the real star here, the sandwiches in particular are amazing.  I had the Rowdy's chicken which was juicy and delicious.  I had a half portion of the mac-and-cheese to accompany it which was so good!  I highly recommend the combination of the two.\\n\\nNow this place has space issues as everything is cramped, and they have a style of shared care where you may encounter many different wait staff and bus-staff.  If you can tolerate these things, and want a great sandwich for lunch this is place to go.

The girlfriend took me here for dinner for my birthday :) and it's probably one of my favorite dining experiences ever. We sat at the bar which was awesome cause we had a direct view into the adjacent kitchen so we got to see all the chefs in action assembly the myriad of components of our amazing dinner. I chose a Spanish Pinot (with help from our waitress) to pair with my meal which was quite good. We were served a 12 course tasting + an extra bay scallop dish they were offering (+$6).\\n\\nMenu that night:\\nScotch quail egg, kentucky caviar\\nSunchoke soup, oyster, apple gel, turnip\\nCrab chip, tangerine, fennel\\nBeet trifle, smoked mushroom, blue cheese \\nRoasted chicken dumpling, white truffle, sorghum vinegar\\nLardo, wheat berry porridge, sauerkraut, citrus\\nSnapper, shrimp, field peas, spinach\\nGrilled lamb loin, eggplant, peanut salsa, cilantro\\nSmoked pork custard, green garlic, crispy potato\\nBeer cheese doughnut, apple, fermented chili\\nHoney sorbet, macadamia nut, brie\\nChocolate, orange, chevre\\n\\nEverything was amazing, I don't think there was any particular course I disliked. Some highlights for me included the beet trifle, grilled lamb loin, and beer cheese doughnut. I didn't really think I would like the beet dish as I'm not generally a fan of beets, but I surprisingly enjoyed this one. I think the way the beets were prepared and the earthiness of the mushrooms came together quite well. The lamb was an amazing piece of perfectly cooked meat. The beer cheese doughnut was amazing, it was light and airy but also savory and semi-sweet; never had anything quite like it.\\n\\nService here was amazing, everyone here was so warm and inviting. We got to talk to some of the chefs as they were working and they helped explained some of the more interesting ingredients in depth. The small dining area made the experience much more intimate and it really felt like all the staff was just one big happy family welcoming people to eat in their home. \\n\\nThey even gave us some nice bday gifts! We got an extra dessert cookie dish at the end along with a glass of champagne. They even gave us a mason jar of homemade jam as a parting gift :) We had such great time here, I think that was the first time I ever hugged my waitress after a meal :D I would definitely recommend anyone in Austin or visting to dine at Barley Swine."},{"name":"Twist Frozen Yogurt  Lounge","address":"7535 SW Barnes Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We live in this \\"affluent\\" neighborhood and go to Twist at least once a week.

When she then spills coffee (that stains!) I start to wonder. But when, after spilling on me twice, she tells me that she's going to let me know when the concert downstairs is starting - the concert that I paid good money to see - and then gets around to doing so a full 45 minutes after it has started - I get a little miffed. Well, at least I caught the last two songs. I mean, it is an honest mistake for a busy waitress to forget to tell me and my friend a detail like when the show is starting - but then she shouldn't have offered to do so. I didn't make a special request for her to alert me to this - she brought it up when I mentioned we were seeing the band later. \\n\\nFurthermore, if you spill a drink on a customer once I figure it should be comped. Twice? For sure. I didn't mention this when the bill came, but I shouldn't have to. \\n\\nOn the upside, the food was 3- to 4-star. The appies are mostly standards, but the mains get innovative. They offer good vegan options. The kitchen seems relatively quick. \\n\\nI really want to like Nuba Cafe. I really do. The Waldorf isn't just \\"hipster cool,\\" it is genuinely cool. I like the interior, the seating and tables, and the concept. I like the great events they're putting on, the shows they're having (when I actually get to see the band) and the concept in general. But two of the three times I've gone, the service has been weak, and the third time it was just OK. \\n\\nLet's hope they can put together a stronger team at some point - the Waldorf concept deserves better.\\n\\n(Note: I'll review my experience in the Tiki Lounge at some point - service was far better in there)"},{"name":"Steveston Village Vietnamese Restaurant","address":"120-12480 No 1 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious broth.

Served with real maple syrup, and berry syrup, what a great meal! My husband's roast beef hash was like whoa! If you're the type of person that feels like they never give you enough meat in hash this one is for you! I swear there must have been a whole 10 ounces of beef in there.

It was still pretty full at 8:30, we sat at the bar to watch them work the wok and see the food coming out.

It did take them about 3 mins to figure out we were waiting and were brought a dish when we hadn't ordered anything yet, but in general the rest went smoothly. The people there were all REALLY friendly, we chatted with one of the cooks for a while about the food, and it was nice to see that he was super gung ho about the place. \\n\\nAs for the food, I'd give it only about 3 stars:\\n- Oysters - Fresh, cheap, yay.\\n- DanDan Noodles - Run of the mill noodles w/ peanut sauce spiced up w/ lime + cilantro, can do this at home.\\n- Sweet Potato Fritters - Like a hush puppy, wish it had more Chinese sausage action, but tasty.\\n- Mama Changs Chive dumplings - Sadly, worse than store bought frozen ones. Don't even bother.\\n- Tea Smoked Ribs - Not the transcendental experience previously described, but falling of the bone and flavorful.\\n- Brussels Sprouts - Tasty, but nothing vaguely Chinese about it and do-able at home as well.\\n\\nDesserts/Beverage gets this place 4 stars:\\n- Lychee Soda - I don't even like lychee, but I really enjoyed this.\\n- Vanilla Bean Parfait w/ Orange Granita - Like a really light tasty orange creamsicle.\\n- Choco Mousse w/ 5-spice Marshmallows - Yay for the lactose intolerant! Cuz its made from tofu, but tasted smooth, no suggestion of soy. The \\"mashmallows\\" are actually meringues - an intriguing flavor combo w/ the choco. \\n\\nOverall, the food was just OK, but  I liked the venue, service, concept and desserts.  The whole tab including tip came out to ~$100 for 2, which is not a great value for this type of food - so I think its better to come for dimsum, where many of the same items are avail for half as much.

Our new best friend came bounding over to us smiling and giggling and welcomed us and asked if we had been before.  Nope.

After a bit, I walked back over to Barley and poked my head in to see if we were up yet.  Buffy, the giddy hostess, looked at me and went back to her job.  I got the hint and ducked back out... she then called me as I was walking back to my bar stool and said, \\"Oh come back! I got you the best seat in the house!  he he ha la la .. oh look a squirrel\\".  We really liked Buffy.

It made my tummy feel really good.. and on that note, the sweetbreads with braised bacon and sprouts was the shizzle.  (See what I did there.. tummy=sweetbreads..ahem..)  I have never eaten either, and never would of thought of eating that to begin with.  Neither would I ever pay $41 for a bottle of wine, but I did last night.\\n\\nAnd here is what I think Barley Swine does best.. oodles of atmosphere, which intoxicates you into doing things you wouldn't normally do.

We called the restaurant, and they quite pleasantly changed the order with no problem.  Once one of our naans was missing from the delivery bag.

The delivery driver also apologized when he brought it.  (And we only had to wait about the amount of time it'd take to drive to our house for the replacement).  Given how often we order in (at least once a week) the fact that we've only ever had a missing item once and they were so awesome about the error is pretty amazing.\\n\\nI highly recommend trying them out if you like your Indian food with rich, creamy sauce and spicy.

Perhaps not their doing, but whom ever owns the building. However the restroom does not appear to be handicapped accessible either. One thing I really dislike is when I see the staff prepping food in the dinning area (not in a prep area, but at a table used for seating).

I went here with my friend about a month or so ago because we were already on Huntington Ave for something and figured we'd just eat at this location instead of going to the one we usually go to on Boylston. Bad decision. We got there slightly after 6pm - maybe around 6:15 or so, 6:20 at the very latest I'm pretty sure. We were seated right away (by a very friendly hostess - pretty much the only positive thing about this whole experience) and the restaurant was nowhere near full. About 15 minutes later, our waiter came over to take our drink order. My friend ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of Sangria (which turned out to be really underwhelming and watered-down-tasting). Our waiter asked to see our IDs and did this weird thing where he asked my friend how old she is as he was looking at her ID. She replied \\"23\\" and he said \\"works for me!\\". It was really odd. About another 15 minutes later, he finally came back with our drinks (There was a couple sitting across from us [serviced by the same waiter] who came in after us and got their drinks at least 5 minutes before we did). He didn't give me a straw. I didn't bother to ask for one because it wasn't a big deal, but he didn't notice that I didn't have one until about the third time he came back to our table to check on us (I don't remember for sure, but I think we may have had our food by that point).  My friend and I were talking with each other while having our drinks and didn't have anywhere we had to be at any certain time, so we kind of lost track of time while talking and didn't realize how much time had passed since we placed our food order (when we got our drinks). Eventually we realized something was up and checked the time and realized we had been at the restaurant almost an hour and didn't have our food yet. Finally our food came soon after this, and our waiter told us that the reason it took so long was because they made me the wrong salad and subsequently had to re-make it.  Now, as I previously mentioned, I've been to Uno many times before, and I have ordered that same salad, and because of this I know for a fact that it does not take as long to make as he was claiming it does. Also, for some reason, they put the crispy chicken from my wrong salad on the new salad that they made for me that isn't supposed to come with crispy chicken (and I don't like crispy chicken in salads and this chicken happened to be really overcooked). By the time we left the restaurant it was after 8pm. If I was in a time-crunch and hadn't lost track of time like I had, and didn't have an aversion to complaining about food service workers due to my own experience working as one, I would have complained about this to the manager. I really suggest you not go here and go to the Boylston Street location instead if you're in this area of Boston and have an Uno craving."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been coming here since college.

But maybe they are known for their good looking bartenders too? ;)] The waffles are about the size of your palm and come with your choice of dipping sauces/toppings.

I wouldn't even say I have too much experience with it...a few meals here and there.  It's always proven to be an interesting and somewhat fun (roll up your sleeves and get into it) kind of a dining experience.  So I came to Desta with some friends after seeing some rave reviews on yelp.  There were very few customers when we came one Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Desta, located in a little Ethiopian shopping corner, seemed like a quaint and charming ma and pa kind of restaurant - bonus points already!  We sat outside, and it was a beautiful day.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  I ordered the fish tibbs and was quite impressed with the intensity of flavor the fish had.  It was jam-packed!  The prices were pretty good, too, considering it was seafood, and I would say Desta served us average portions.  My friends got chicken tibbs and they looked pretty delish too.  The best part, of course, was the injera bread.  That stuff will fill you up like nothing else!  One thing I thought was strange was that most Ethiopian places let you do some sort of family style meal where the toppings come out on the injera and you share as a table, but it doesn't seem like Desta has this option.  If my time weren't limited in ATL, I would definitely come back and sample more of the menu.  \\n\\nOther things:\\n- The appetizer we ordered - sambusas - were kind of a rip even though they were tasty.  They were bite-size at best and only came with 4-5 pieces. \\n- I think it's definitely worth noting that ATL has a sizable Ethiopian community.  Nothing better than to support locally owned immigrant communities!\\n- Desta even gives you little wet wipes at the end (cuz Ethiopian can be kinda intense when you get your hands into it).

It was salted plum and it was gross.  But I ordered two more because I was so hungry and just took the salty plum out and ate the rice and soy paper.  They don't give you soy sauce, so at the end of the meal, we finally asked for some to help out my 'rice and soy paper'.

This will actually be the first Yelp review I've ever written after being on here for about 5 years. I had to write it, HAD TO, and if you eat here once you will understand why.\\n\\nThe food. Oh my good God the food. I went on a Friday night with my girlfriend. We had read reviews about Barley Swine and were dressed and set for a unique dining experience. They don't take reservations and we showed up a little late (10:30 and they close at 11:00) so we actually got seated immediately at the bar just in time for last call for food orders. She settled in with a glass of white wine (I don't do white wine so I have no comments about the selection) and I opted for a draft Treehugger (deeeeelicious). \\n\\nThe menu works like a tapas restaurant where everything is kind of a small portion and you share. You order whatever items you want and the culinary geniuses at Barley Swine course it out for you. We ordered five savory items and one dessert to share and both ended up completely satisfied.\\n\\nWe started with some sort of grilled broccoli plate with chili, crushed duck egg, and goat cheese and were immediately transported to another world. The flavor combination in every dish was amazing and it started here with this light, savory ditty. We were immediately in the mindset to take small bites and enjoy every single tingle of flavor there was.\\n\\nOur second dish was a beet \\"salad\\" although it wasn't a salad the way you might think of it. It was roasted beets and some roasted japanese sweet potato and some sort of delicious leafy things. It was drizzled with a lemon sauce and a red beet sauce which were both tangy and delicious on their own. \\n\\nBy this time we were nice and warmed up and it was a good thing too because now it was time for the goat.\\n\\nOh man. The goat.\\n\\nLet me start out by saying that I have eaten amazing food all over and this goat dish firmly placed this dining experience in my all-time top 3 (with being a restaurant in Okayama, Japan where the chef, the hunter, and the owner was all the same wise old Japanese man, and the other being Franklin's brisket). It was....I don't even know what they did to make it so delicious. There were only three good bites total on the plate and we split it and it was still more than enough somehow. Without prior planning, we both ended up chewing our bites with our eyes closed. The dish started out a little salty. Kind of like when you bite into a REALLY good burger and it has a delicious saltiness to it. But that sensation fades away just as soon as you think it might be too much into a subtle combination of meat juices mixed with whatever divine sauce/oil was on the bottom of the plate. It was perfectly tender and melted in my mouth like cotton candy.\\n\\nAs if it couldn't get any better, the goat (oh, the GOAT!) was followed by a chicken fried chicken egg dish. WHAAAT? I know, that's what I said, but it was amazing. It was like a soft-boiled egg batter fried to a bright crispiness, served with some sort of amazing sauce again and some green garlic grits (say that five times fast). This dish mimicked some of the salty-savory qualities of the previous dish but was far less rich and exactly what my palette wanted right then.\\n\\nAt this point we had both had a couple of drinks and the combination of the alcohol and the amazing food swimming in our stomachs had us both grinning like fools in some sort of hypnosis. We felt high off of this food. We would have been content at this point to just sit and stare ecstatically at the wall. \\n\\nBut wait, there were still two more courses remaining in our adventure of indulgence. \\n\\nNext came the sweet potato dish and this one has got to win the flavor-combination-of-the-year award. It was little cubes of sweet potato (crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside), grilled local-farmed bacon (ohmygodbacon), mint yogurt, and pecans. Get a little bit of each one on your spoon and pop it in and all these newfound friends just swim around in your mouth, copulating into something almost spiritual. \\n\\nWe finished off with the hemp-seed brownie, which is NOT a dry, mealy, hippie brownie like you might expect. It was delectable chocolate and peanut butter (my achilles heal) and they served it with a roasted banana ice cream. Now I am not a dessert person so this was not the highlight of the meal (ohmyjesuschrist THE GOAT) but it was a nice way to finish the whole experience. \\n\\nAfter two drinks each, six courses, and some delightful conversation with our bartender Billy (with a 'y', but she's a girl), we got out of there for about $120 including tip. And worth EVERY PENNY.\\n\\n...PS, try the goat."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The young lady and I had planned a trip into Boston yesterday so she could drag me around to clothes stores and I could weep like a child, but the eating situation was still up in the air. \\"Mara just wrote a great review for this chinese place and it's near south station,\\" said Young Lady. Mara, you should know, is a classy dame who really knows where her towel's at, so that was that. \\n\\nParking was a breeze; it's tucked into a not super busy segment of Washington Street. I'm not over-fond of hipsters, but my initial trepidation dissolved as we walked in; people make too big a deal out of this place being \\"trendy\\" or whatever. It's not all kitschy and wacky and full of ironic people plodding away on Apple products,  it's just sort of modern and whimsical and funky. The staff seem to enjoy working there, and we were fortunate to get seated at the bar overlooking the tiny open kitchen, where four of the most coordinated and hardworking line cooks I have ever seen buzzed under the watchful eyes of the eponymous Chang (noteworthy in particular because she asked us how things were and watched every morsel of food that left her kitchen.)  My girlfriend has celiac, so we were both happy that M+C have a dedicated gluten-free menu, a touch that I think a lot of places don't fully comprehend the anxiety-removing presence of. From that we got the Chinese cucumbers, and from the other menu, some pork belly buns. Obviously, too, cocktails. She got a Blood Orange and Campari stinger called a Bittersweet Symphony, which was astringent, perfumey and medicinal, but in a good way. It was just the sort of thing to refresh the senses and encourage the appetite, and we would both order it again. I got a mai tai. I am a Mai Tai Purist, and the offering here includes a citrus-infused rum and yadda yadda, but I can't dock a fusion restaurant points for not making a \\"traditional enough\\" mai tai, no matter how much of an obnoxious snob I am. Theirs was actually quite tasty, and did have orgeat in it, which not enough renditions do these days. It could have been stronger but, you know, I am clearly a drunkard.\\n\\nThe cucumbers were lovely; a bowl quite literally overflowing with slices of cool fresh green half-moons. The sesame paste was intense and almost peanutty, but cut by a vinegar and citrus bite that made eating it easy and fun. The pork belly buns were an interesting deconstruction of a traditional bun, with slices of rich pork belly and sauce topped with some peppery microgreens and wrapped in a slice of steamed bread. A counterpoint of pickled red and green chilies added a bit of punchy zaz. I was tempted to order more to fill my pockets with them. We ordered more food now, the famous Red Miso Glazed Carrots and Spicy Silk Tofu, as well as a bowl of Dan Dan noodles for me. They came out as they finished cooking. The tofu dish and the carrot dish were an interesting study in contrast. The carrots were regular old common carrots, transformed by a highly practiced alchemy into one of the most delicious savory dishes I have ever had. Red Miso is intensely umami, and the wok burners here are like jet engines, so these carrots became a glazed charred thing of beauty. Eat them; they will make your eyes roll back in your head. The tofu, on the other hand, needed no wizardry. I don't mean to say the dish wasn't' expertly prepared; it was! Fragrant, spicy, with fresh bok choy and minced pork, it was as good as any traditional szechuan Ma Po Tofu I have ever had, but the tofu itself, my god. Really good tofu has a fermented lactic tang; this tofu was almost like a really good feta or Indian paneer. This is probably the only time you will ever see me claim that the tofu was the stand-out star of a dish that also included pork. I KNOW! As we were finishing that, I was feeling thirsty (sober) so I ordered a carafe of Mr. Pibb's with limeade and cucumber, refreshing and summery. Whisky-infused appetite bolstered, I tackled the Dan Dan noodles. It says they're another regional style of the original sichuan, but if anything they seemed like a southeast asian riff, with lime and cilantro nicely tempering the spicy sweet thick peanut and sesame sauce. The noodles themselves were toothsome and very resilient without being overly chewy; very nice! At this point we realized that we were very, very full, so we grabbed the check, which was 92 bucks before tip.\\n\\nHere's the critical part; that's a lot for a chinese place, but you wouldn't bat an eye at that if you were at a french bistro. This is a fusion restaurant, in the old pre-overused sense of the word. Creative, high quality, different. I have left restaurants where I spent more and felt less satiated. If you want Chinese food, go to Chinatown, it has some of the best Chinese food in the world. But if you're in the mood for interesting chinese inspired food-art made really well by fun people, you can't do better than this.

Goat cheese salad was good but nothing we couldn't make at home- spring mix greens, sunflower seeds, balsamic vinaigrette and a small dollop of ch√®vre.  The filet mignon was thinner than expected but still cooked perfectly medium rare. The scallops were blackened and not plural.

It was way more food than we expected. \\n\\nAlso, the service was great. I am sure this was in part due to the place being practically empty, but our waitress was very nice and attentive in any case.\\n\\nAs for parking, they'll validate 3 hours at the valet, but NOTHING in the self-park.

Oh, so right. \\n\\nChocolate salted almond: You had me at chocolate.

The bulgogi  goes with the tater tots in a strange but complimenting way. Those two are mist trys.\\n\\nNow for the service portion. The service started off well and ended poorly. I came here with 5 of my friends and asked the waitress to split the tab evenly between us. We signed our card slips and walked outside to walk to our next venture, MJQ. As we were standing outside, our waitress comes outside and asks us if the service was not good? Puzzled, we said no we thought the service was just fine? Then she goes on to state that if the service was good then why did one person fail to tip her? At this point we are all looking around at each other confused. She then proceeds to say the name of the person who didn't leave her tip. It turns out that person left tip in cash and not on her card.\\n\\nHonestly, I have never encountered that type of service in my existence. It was the act of her having to come ask us why we didn't leave her tip that bothered me. I have worked in the service industry as well so I understand what it feels like to get jipped. However, I find it very unprofessional for anyone to follow a customer outside to confront them about \\"failing to pay tip.\\" \\n\\nHopefully this experience did not negatively effect my view on the restaurant bc the food here is definitely worth going back for.

We showed up on a Tuesday around 10am and were able to get sat right away.

Don't put too much of the toppings on it or you won't be able to appreciate the flavor of the waffle on its own. It sort of has this extremely thin glaze over the entire waffle which makes it slightly crunchy but still so soft and moist on the inside. I'm still dreaming of it. The powdered sugar on top compliments it perfectly. Oh-- And don't leave without trying their lavender infused latte..

We came down for just the day - half the day, really - and unfortunately, weather was 90¬∞ and we are not heat-friendly. So trying to figure out things to do in a city we've never been, that's really only known for its food and drink, was a bit difficult. I did some pretty meticulous (read: anal) searching for a lunch spot, a dinner spot, a brewery, and a dessert spot (bonus points if the dinner location had local beer and cider on tap as well as dessert - kill three birds).\\n\\nWell, much to my chagrin, this place did not exist. At least... they do exist, but very few places offer dark beers. Or at least a good selection that we can't go to our grocery store here in Washington and buy. We wanted a real PDX experience.\\n\\nSo imagine my surprise, as I'm surfing through the streets via Google Maps and finding little restaurants to look into on Yelp, that Blue Star Donuts shows up right beside Lardo, where we were wanting to have dinner. I did some quick research and thanks a lot, Yelpers, we found an exquisite winner!\\n\\nThe line was practically out the door when we got there at 4:15 on a Sunday. I wanted to believe that everyone in line was not a first timer, and that their donuts are so good that they've become a staple in the Portland folks' lives. It took us about half an hour from start to finish. The line moved slow enough for us to get a good look at what was available and make decisions. There was only one gentleman working and he kept his cool. Ring up a customer, take their payment, print out a list, fill the order, and donuts go to a new home. Pretty simple.\\n\\nThe place is immaculate and beautiful. I loved the space. I like to use words like \\"warm\\", \\"quaint\\", and \\"cozy\\" for places I love, and BSD is the exact opposite. Tall ceilings, lots of white, and big windows bringing in tons of sunshine (but not a whole lot of warmth which was a plus!).\\n\\nWe ended up buying a blueberry bourbon basil, cinnamon vanilla, the OG, the PB&J, and the passionfruit cacao donut. I won't say how (don't want anyone to try to take advantage of the shop), but I ended up getting two free donuts out of the visit, and I couldn't thank the guy enough. The donuts are anywhere from $2.75 to $3.75 each, so I walked away spending just under $12 for half a dozen - I can't complain one bit. (Thank you again, sir.)\\n\\nWe went to dinner, got to our car, and hit the road to make the three hour trip home. About half way there, I ate half of the OG with the horchata glaze and I was immediately hooked. We got stuck in traffic outside of Olympia and neither one of us could reach the donut box in the back of the car, which was probably for the best because I could have eaten them all right then and there.\\n\\nWe finished them off today and every single one of the flavors were awesome. My other half's only criticism was that he wouldn't have chosen to put habanero in the PB&J, but said it was still a unique combination. I loved the cayenne in the passionfruit cacao, and the hint of cardamom in the cinnamon vanilla was perfect. \\n\\nOn one hand, I'm sad that I live three hours away and won't get these but once in a blue moon. On the other hand, I'm so thankful this shop isn't anywhere near me. I don't know that I could restrain myself. This place blows Voodoo out of the water. They are worth the wait and the price.

Their brioche dough is fluffy, moist, and never too sweet. All their flavors are unique and never overly drenched on the donut. There's always something for everyone. Something sweeter, like their chocolate ganache, or something more savory, like their bacon donut. My favorite is their passionfruit. It's a little tart and a little sweet. \\n\\nThe only thing that bums me out is that they are no longer making donuts fresh in-house. They all come from one baking location and get sent out to all the locations. From what I understand, they do send a few shipments a day (so the donuts are still fresh from the day). But the downside is that once they run out, that's it! You have to wait from another batch to come in. So timing is hard and mostly just luck.

Although, a bit more mackerel would be grand. The matjes (one herring) very tender and good quality but I found it to be a bit too salty, the combination of green beans, bacon & onion were very good. \\nMains. schnitzel, a good size portion. To be honest I don't have a lot of experience with schnitzel. Here goes, the meat (veal) was tender and clearly well prepared, breaded nicely. But, in my opinion, not much flavour to it on its own. Combining the accompanied potato/cucumber salad, which I really liked, and cranberry made for a good dish. Ok, I think I'm not a big fan of schnitzel then. Will have to try the sauerbraten should I return. Halibut, was slightly undercooked, not enough to send back, but enough to notice. For high end food, I  expect exactness.

It could have just as easily been any other sort of meat and I wouldn't have known based on the bucket of distinctly not French sauce dumped over everything on my plate. It kind of tasted like a  barbecue sauce with a sweet teriyaki kick, but not really sure that's a good description. It was strange and unappetizing, and certainly not something that should ever be poured over fish. The sides were identical on everyone's plates, green beans and rice or potatoes like banquet hall food. No thought was placed in whether a different starch might work better with the main. The dessert, a raspberry mousse, wasn't horrible. It was just okay. The escargot was also just okay. Service was a little better than okay. The waiter was friendly and maintained his composure when everyone except one person at my table expressed that the dinner was a disappointment (he had the pork). He even maintained his composure when I fed a bite of my dinner to the manager to show him just how bad it was, to which the manager seemed to agree.

Sadly, that was, literally, the sentiment about their HVAC system. High marks overall for the food and service but the climate and noise level had our diners steaming. A number of standout plates kept us sticking to our seats in the better sense. \\"Tender meatballs in a sauce worthy of many extra slices of crusty bread\\" and \\"superb tuna with canelli beans\\" brought raves but the squid ink dish \\"polarized the table.\\" Drink reviews were mixed but, this being a wine bar, highest praise came from those having wine. The selection of sherries is excellent and tasting portions allowed for a range of sampling. Nearly everyone thought the service was \\"attentive and observant\\" but, thanks to the high noise level, it was often difficult to hear what dishes were being brought to us. With accolades from those who enjoyed the tasting menu, it isn't surprising that several nominations for First Friday Favorite status were received\\n\\nINDIVIDUAL COMMENTS:\\n\\nthe tasting menu was really fun. Good choice overall! Might go back for more squid sometime.\\n--\\nBeautiful tapas restaurant that was unfortunately, a little noisy and hot. The service was excellent - water glass were always full, servers were knowledgeable and patient and deftly handled our large party. I LOVED the per person options which allowed a large group to taste many different tapas at a leisurely pace. I also liked that you could get a taste of a wine (1/2 glass) without committing to a full glass. Sangria was fine but no better than sangria I've had at non-tapas restaurants. Stand out tapas included arancini-like fried balls of manchego and serrano ham, seared tuna with a white bean and cilantro topping, and tender meatballs in a sauce worthy of many extra slices of crusty bread. While impressive, the squid ink rice dish pushed the limits of even this seafood-lover's palate and polarized the table. All in all, I would go back to try the cheese and house-made charcuterie and sample many more wines and cocktails.\\n--\\nThe tasting menu was much more generous than expected and a spectacular value for tapas, which are often overpriced. Overall the tapas were good, not great (with exceptions on both ends for the superb tuna with canelli beans, and the terrible tortilla espana - so sad, i love tortilla, but i'm spoiled by my sister's).  The space is cool, and buzzy and fun, though yes, too hot.  Our server was helpful, and brought us anything we could have wanted, and water was refilled constantly. Letting the tasting menu and excellent service drive the evening gave us lots of time to talk and jjust enjoy without lots of thinking and fussing over details.\\n--\\nThe croquettes, the empanadas, seared tuna with white beans salad, chickpea and spinach casserole, and meatballs were all winners.  Adding to the evening was the waiter - attentive and observant, he took one look at a few of us when the the squid ink \\"main\\" came out and brought the table conciliatory empanadas.  Not every tapa was a winner, but they never are - the option they provided was awesomely cost-effective compared to what would've happened normally. Definitely adds HUGE value to a tapas venue - definitely a reason to go back as part of a larger group.  Unfortunately, it was warm and noisy. Definitely worth going back.\\n--\\nThis was my least favorite FF venue - EVER.  When it comes to tapas I would have to agree with Tim's husband because I've no doubt that if there is a Hell, all they serve there is tapas.    I also found the decor lacking, [There were far too many fried offerings\\n--\\nWhisky Root cocktail with fresh ginger and basil was excellent. The tasting menu was a great way to experience a wide range of the the tapas, definitely an exceptional value. Spinach Chickpea Cazuela was a favorite as well as the Tuna and beautifully blackened Squid Ink Fideos. Service was very attentive. I did not find the room to be too hot as other diners did. I really liked the double sided wall of wine,\\n--\\nI really enjoyed this first Friday. The tasting menu is definitely the way to go with Tapas, seeing as the entire point of tapas is to try a lot of dishes. I think the servers were right on point, always making sure we had plenty to drink, and keeping the food rotating at the perfect pace.  I'm not sure why hell would only serve Tapas, because these bites were a little taste of heaven.\\n--\\nTapas makes me nervous because it can cost so much for so little food. But I loved having a fixed price for a parade of plates. It took the pressure of choosing away and let us just enjoy each other's company. Not every dish was a winner nor what I might choose but there were some outstanding dishes: oh! That cold bean and tuna dish! What was especially nice was that they would also allow anyone to choose anything from the list. I could have done with more AC and less potato tart."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Been here many times food is great!

So, if it wasn't for the price of the donuts I would give them more stars.  I bought 4 donuts and with a tip I think it was like close to $13 bucks. That seems a lot for 4 donuts.

I would have previously rated it a 4/5 before the two experiences I had there within the past week.\\nWe were a party of 10 who was given a brand new server with pretty much no help. To top that off, they gave the poor dude a second large party (12+). The server did tell us about how to place the card in the holder to get any server's attention and said they operate on \\"teamwork\\", but there was little to no teamwork in helping this guy out. Each round of drinks took way to long to get made/delivered. First round of food actually arrived pretty quickly. About the time he started taking the second large group's order is when we were trying to order. Multiple servers walked by or stood at the kiosk right in front of our table without acknowledging our card. He came to take the order cards 10 minutes later when he was done with getting the orders of the other party. 30+ minutes go by and no second round of food had arrived. We ask him to check on it and come to find out it was never put in. At that point I said nevermind and asked for the check. We then had to ask for the check a second time and then track the server down to give him the card.\\nAlthough the server had some room for improvement, that is certainly to be expected with any new person, and we really felt sorry for the guy. This is a clear case of bad management - letting a brand new person serve two large parties with pretty much no help.\\nBad service does seem to be a theme at this restaurant though.

Sincerely appreciated his response so I'm updating the review to 4 stars for the great food and overall good ambience of the restaurant. Original review below.\\n\\n------\\n\\nMy family and I were in the restaurant celebrating our first niece in our family and having a great time. At one point, my sister had asked where her drink was after our brothers got the drinks they ordered. She forgot exactly the drink she ordered and ordered a different drink instead to the server (this was her second drink of the night after a full course dinner). The server said nothing at the time and went to get the drink, but when the server returned, she said she couldn't serve us because my sister didn't remember what she initially ordered. After I confronted the server about this, she said we were too drunk and couldn't continue serving us. \\n\\nI'm writing about this now because obviously we were sober enough to understand and feel disrespected for what happened. We were with our brothers who just happened to drink beers, and it was never questioned if they were too drunk. Why were we (the women) treated like we drank too much, when we were ordering drinks and just having a good time celebrating our niece's recent birth?\\n\\nWe had a wonderful time at the restaurant with the delicious food but were just taken aback by the server's behavior, which put such a negative light on the whole experience. When I explained the situation to the manager on duty, he completely disregarded my comments and just made the situation worse than it could've been."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Parish Cafe, you used to be so wonderful. What happened?\\n\\nThis was one of the places I did not want to review because I went here or got take out 1-3 times a week and it was already busy enough, why make the lines longer, saying how great it was? (they even had to stop doing take out during peak hours). Alas, it is no longer great. \\n\\nThe last 3 times my husband and I ate here we both did not feel well afterward. Once, you think fluke. Twice, coincidence. Three times? I don't know what is going on, but something has changed. \\n\\nI guess I am not the only one that noticed, because on a recent warm Friday evening we met there after work. Last year the patio would have been full, with a waiting list even, but it wasn't. Neither was the restaurant. The entire back half of the place was empty, but they seated everyone up front by the windows. \\n\\nWe ordered our usual (formerly favorite) food and ate. Mistake. Both of us were sick that night. (no, it was not from drinking too much; we did not try their 100+ beers). \\n\\nSo, all I can say is, we need a little time apart. You used to be my go to restaurant. Maybe your mac and cheese is still divine, perhaps your beet salad (when it is on the menu) is still wonderful, but after 3 bad sandwich experiences, I'm a little hesitant to try again.

Of special note, while my friend and I were at the bar before being sat at our table, I happened to notice that Sean (the aforementioned fab and handy bartender) is ALSO handsome!  And watch out ladies, he has an even raspier voice than the Trivago guy!\\n\\n~~~~~\\n\\nSo I have seen a few reviews on here complaining about it seeming like a party at Giuseppe's that they aren't a part of.  I won't presume to know the circumstances of these peoples experiences, but I will relate mine:\\n\\nI am pretty much known by the second or third time I frequent anywhere, especially a special place like Giuseppe's.  The main reason is because I make an effort to get to know everyone that comes up to me on the first time of my visit.  I ask their name, about what they do in their free time, their families, etc.  I am a curious person, and show interest in their lives.  When I walk out my door, I don't look at people as my help, because at the end of the day, we are all someones help.  And when I return to a place, I ask them about their lives, in detail.  And this goes from the owner to the busboy.  Everyone is important to me.\\n\\nIn all, I am saying that one must make an effort first.  If I want instant affirmation, I will go to Panera down the street, or to a Ground Round.  Or a Foot Locker for that matter.  \\n\\nI am used to living in cities where the best clubs and restaurants make you work a little to get the secret handshake.  We have a culture here in Cbus that needs to be shed.  It's the assumption that you are a winner, just for showing up.  It's a really shallow expectation.  We don't make relationships in 5 minutes.  I hate to break the news, but the gal serving you at Panera doesn't give a shit about you.  She cares about her $7.25/hr job and not getting fired by a manager who insists on her smiling and over-greeting everyone who walks in the door, because Panera wants to move rolls.  It's not about relationships, it's about rolls.\\n\\nGiuseppe's is a different kind of place.  Giuseppe is creating a space for fostering relationships, set upon the tapestry of his love of food and fellowship.  If you want to feel like you are part of the family at Giuseppe's (or anywhere else including Panera), be patient, be curious, and be persistent.  It's worth the effort, believe me."},{"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Place","address":"24 Pearl St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I had never had Tibetan food before this place and I must say, I loved this meal so much.

Food was incredibly lackluster, not fresh, and not served warm. \\n\\nTonight a friend and I thought to give it a second chance thinking, oh it was just a fluke before. Yea, no. I didn't listen to my gut and we went in for a dinner around 7. The menu is a disorganized wreck- the salads are listed not under 'salad' but DJs Signatures, are immediately followed by some entrees. They serve soup, but it's not listed anywhere and if I hadn't had asked for them then I wouldn't have known. I was also missing a page in my menu in the back: i guess they serve brunch on the weekends. \\n\\nWe ordered in total, the loaded nachos, mild wings & fries, french onion soup, and a margarita flat bread. I cannot for the life of my figure out what kind of cheese was on the nachos, I'm thinking kraft singles but that is only a guess and I'm basing it on how quickly the cheese congealed. Why that's something I know is beyond me. The wings were dripping in sauce, it was just really too much.  I had really been excited for soup, I guess I was just craving it today. With that being said, imagine my sadness at receiving a bowl of soup that is not only burnt but cold. How does that happen?? Best guess is that it's prepared in advance, frozen, then thawed out. The plate that the flat bread came out on was warmer than the soup. The flatbread was nothing to write home about.\\n\\nOur waitress was very sweet, she wasn't the fastest but it was looking like she was being overextended on the floor. She got every aspect of our order correct, even down to things we wanted on the side as well as our drinks. Towards the end though, she just looked very defeated, and I think that I would to if I had to work there- I've done the waitressing thing before and I can't imagine the tips there are that great. \\n\\nAll in all, I won't go back.

This we were informed by a helpful sign on the door, instead of a helpful message when you dial their phone number (\\"We will be closed October 10 and 11 due to a catering event and will re-open on the 24th.\\")  Nor any kind of notification on their website, which is the sort of thing you might expect a business to do if they are going to be closed for two weekends.

The fried chicken is just a little on the spicy side but it was probably the best fried chicken that I've ever tasted. I included the baked beans and coleslaw and both were very good. I like my baked beans a little on the sweeter side with brown sugar and these were tangy. Nonetheless they were excellent. I seldom rate a restaurant five stars and the only reason why I'm not rating five stars for this is the temperature of the chicken was extremely hot all the way to the end. There was steam coming from the chicken the whole meal. It was almost too hot to eat, but it was so good you couldn't stop. I finished the meal with a slice of the original coconut pie and you will want to give this a try as well. It's like the old-fashioned transparent or chess pie but with coconut.  Very rich but not so much that it was over-the-top.

It wasn't until I spoke to one of their brewers at Denver's Great American Beer Festival that I found out why.

We had the Chana Paneer Masala and Shahi Navratan Korma as our mains, and the Pista Coconut Naan and plain Naan on the side, with a Mango Lassi and Badam Kulfi for dessert. The Chana Paneer was a unique dish, very tasty and creamy; a great protein dish for vegetarians. The Korma was full of vegetables, and delicious as usual. The Pista Coconut Naan was another innovation, and was absolutely fantastic - great on its own or with your main dish. The regular naan was good, very fresh, but considering how much rice came with the meals, it was probably unnecessary in hindsight. The Mango Lassi and Kulfi were both delicious, and the Kulfi was especially flavorful.\\n\\n- FOR THE VEGGIES: Plenty of options here, including daal/lentils, chickpeas, and paneer, plus many vegetable dishes.

So unique and just full of flavor.\\n\\nDough? *  Do not tell me Krispy Kreme dough texture was better than this place.  Ive found way better hole-in-the-wall spots where the dough just melts in your mouth.  Where its soft and flakey.  At blue start it was very heavy and almost cake'y.\\n\\nOverall....A-Ok.  Would i go again? yes.  Would i wait in a long line for about 30 min for? no.  I will add that their service was FAST when u get to order.  That was cool.\\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"Chef Hung Taiwanese Beef Noodle","address":"4151 Hazelbridge Way, Unit 2800","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Good lunch spot.

Finding their restaurant was a bit tricky. Upon entering, it had an old 1970's appearance/ambience to it. Fake plants, cheap decoration - they have a glass shelf with knick-knacks and it was dusty. (You'd think with business being so slow, they could at least clean up a bit?!) \\nI ordered spring roll and was surprised they only serve one - and Pad Thai. The appetizer turned out to be a pleasant surprise that it was a large spring roll (other Thai restaurants I've gone before are usually skinny, the size of my index finger width)  - it was delicious - crispy on the outside and ample of filling. Not like some other places that has super thick crust and little bit of vegetables/meat filling. The Pad Thai dish was then served but they forgot to give me a napkin, fork and/or chopsticks. I realized that nearly all the tables were void of napkins/utensils - so you can tell it's quite a very slow business here.  There was only one other customer at the entire restaurant - I don't mind that. Important thing is the food: Pad Thai dish was DELICIOUS - not too sweet, not too spicy - portion was generous - it was perfect. I will come back for more."},{"name":"Coast Restaurant","address":"1054 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here on a Wednesday night with my friend since I told him I was craving seafood. We arrived just after 6pm without a reservation and was able to be seated immediately as long as we were gone by 8pm. That wasn't going to be a problem since we had a show to catch anyway and this was just going to be a quick dinner. The interior was dark and dimly lit with very attractive decor. Our waiter was extremely nice and attentive so service was great. I ordered the grilled salmon and the truffle fries. My friend ordered the chef's selection of oysters and they were superb. In fact, I am craving them right now even though over 3 weeks have passed. My grilled salmon was delicious. The one gripe I have about it was that the grill marks tasted bitter so that wasn't pleasant. The truffle fries were very tasty and I ended up having to pack it to go since we were in a rush to leave. I also ordered a lychee martini and it was SO good. The tartness covered up the taste of the alcohol so honestly I could've ordered more of it but I was already a bit buzzed from finishing one.

In the short time that I was employed at The Mighty Oak I had two personal incidents, both of which conflicted with my work.

I organize the events for the group, and one of our favorites is the wine tasting event we put on in February each year. The location at which we usually host this event was undergoing renovations so I reached out to a few spots in the area to see where else we could host the tasting, and Pour impressed from the very start.\\nTheir communications were very prompt and extremely friendly. Working to schedule the tasting, agreeing on a price point and running through the schedule was a breeze with Daniel, their General Manager.\\nThe tasting itself was also incredible. Lee, the extremely knowledgeable and personable vendor who Daniel contacted to walk us through the event, did a great job selecting five wines for our group to taste. They were all delicious and well priced (I ended up buying three bottles!). Daniel and his staff paired each glass with great hors devours, including cheese, scallops, flat breads and beef tenderloin. After the tasting we were able to purchase additional glasses of wine, as well as order bottles, for a discount.\\nThe entire thing was flawless and Daniel and the Pour team were awesome to work with.

The food wasn't bad (or at least I don't think it was--it was not memorable, at least), but the experience as a whole was bizarre and uncomfortable. \\n\\nFor starters, no one greeted me and my date for 45 minutes. But we were enjoying one another's conversation and, in fact, we even made a game of guessing whether a server was headed to our table or not (\\"She's coming, she's coming, she's--OOOOHHH she passed us again!\\"). So we didn't make a big stink about it and actually put off collaring one of the oblivious waitstaff for as long as we could.\\n\\nThen, during the meal, some pretty bad \\"entertainment\\" (a balalaika player, if memory serves) set up shop RIGHT NEXT to us (as in, mere inches from our table, with his tip jar, strangely, on our table). We tried to continue our conversation as he plunked away and eyeballed us like an uptight chaperon making sure there's enough space between two dancers at a junior high prom.\\n\\nFast-forward about six years. Ararat is long gone and another Middle-Eastern-ish place is in its stead.\\n\\nBut I was starting to fear that the weirdness of Ararat was alive and well at Phara's. First, the server seemed so busy she didn't even acknowledge us for the longest time (not 45 minutes, but too long). And during the meal a musician (and I use the word charitably) beat a drum while a lady (who turned out be the eponymous Phara) clanged castanets and belly-danced.\\n\\nJudging from the reviews I've seen here, this sort of thing is a desired attraction for some diners. Part of the experience and all that. But for me, a dancer with a forced smile bouncing all over the room while I'm trying to eat--especially when said room is as tiny as the average living room anyway--is simply not cool. Especially when tip jars are placed on each table. I mean, seriously?\\n\\nBut hey, Phara's has some tasty grub. We had the chicken shish kebab ($16) and the shwarma plate (lamb, $14). The sides and the meat were all wonderful, and actually didn't take a long time (though placing our orders sure did). Our drinks (espresso-like Arabica coffee served with a piece of Turkish delight, $3.25, and Morroccan mint tea, $2) were good as well.\\n\\nI don't know anything about the hookahs--I couldn't care less about such a silly trend. Besides, it was 38 degrees outside while we were there; I doubt any collegiate poseurs were huddled around their water-pipes on the patio reading Kafka tonight. We came for the food.\\n\\nAnd I'll certainly go back. But not when there's \\"entertainment.\\" And I won't stay if it looks like the server is as swamped as ours was tonight (oh, did I mention that paying our bill took about 30 minutes because she kept charging us the wrong amount?). \\n\\nWhatever.

I've been in the neighborhood before, during a Saturday brunch outing at Mul's across the street.  It was an easy walk from the Broadway T stop on the Red Line, once I figured that I should exit the station through the right.\\n\\nParking in the area has a 2 hour limit on weekdays for those without resident stickers, but never fear!  Amrhein's has a nice sized lot right next door for their patrons' use.  They've also doctored up a bit of land as a nice patio area for outdoor dining.\\n\\nRight when you enter, you'll find a good sized space separated into booth seating, and high tops in the bar area to the far right.  However, for those who prefer to dine in a slightly less noisy environment, there lays another dining area to the left, cut off from the larger by a solid wall, yet reachable by an inclined entrance way.\\n\\nService was pleasant.  They started us with a nice bread with both butter pats and an olive oil and Parmesan spread.  I loved that it came with a little spoon for serving, so I could get a higher cheese to oil ratio on my bun.\\n\\nWe went with the BRAISED SHORT RIBS 14oz braised short rib served over garlic mashed potatoes $19 and the NEW ZEALAND RACK OF LAMB Served with a rich Cabernet wine sauce, garlic mashed potatoes and vegetable of the day $25, though they let me swap the sides to suit my fancy.  Although they could not let me have the delicious sounding sweet corn and lobster succotash as they hadn't made that much to go with their swordfish entree, I elected to have their creamy risotto with the short ribs and the potatoes au gratin and veggie of the day (glazed carrots) with the lamb.\\n\\nThe short ribs were tasty and tender, but I found the lamb even more tender and tasty.  Both portions were acceptable, as the lamb, though small, came four double chops to the plate.  Everything was good, but my favorite bite was the creamy risotto (cashews, dried cranberries, caramelized onions, and baby spinach).\\n\\nWe opted to share one dessert, and were glad we did!  The COCONUT CREAM PIE Homemade vanilla wafer crust filled with whipped cream and white chocolate $10 was portioned to share, and creamy good, though the crust was a bit too thick and was the sweetest part of the treat.\\n\\nAn ATM is available in their foyer to the left once you enter, but they also accept credit cards.\\n\\nFour stars.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAmrheins is no longer serving brunch on Saturdays; Sunday brunch is only the brunch buffet.\\n\\nI wish they had thought to update their website at the same time that they had updated their menu in July - it would have saved me from disappointment.\\n\\nI checked their website again just now, and am a bit confused - it shows a Sunday brunch menu, but they had told me that they would only be offering a brunch buffet on Sundays, and not an a la carte menu.  My suggestion - call before you go if you have your mind set on ordering something specific.\\n\\n*** 9/2015 ***\\n\\nAnother voucher in hand, another dinner visit to Amrhein's.\\n\\nThe Sacchetti $12 (Pear & Mascarpone tortellini finished with moustarda fruit, chive foundue, and vincotto) was delicious, but a tad pricey for the count of 6 little bundles.  I did however use the bread to wipe up all the luscious creamy sauce.\\n\\nDinner was the Delmonico Steak $28 (16 oz ribeye) with the veggie of the day and swapped sweet potato fries, with the lobster add on for $10, and Amrhein's Lobster Pie $25 (Maine lobster baked with our house crab stuffing and topped with lemon butter) with swapped spinach and risotto.\\n\\nThough ordered medium rare, the steak arrived overcooked, but was quickly whisked away and replaced.  But I had to ask to keep the sides to munch on in the meantime.  The lobster add on was the worst decision.  For our $10, we got the meat of one claw and several knuckles - no tail meat.  It was kind of sad looking, and a bit tough.  The Lobster pie was a little more moist, but still a rather dry dish on the whole though the flavors were good.  The sides were the best part of this course.\\n\\nThe tiramisu $8 was a more normal sized portion dessert, unlike the generous pie of our first visit.  The cream layer was a bit waxy and dense, so definitely not my favorite version of the Italian sweet.\\n\\n3 star visit."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It's a very casual spot.

Probably. As a sidenote: those Wall Street Journal foodies sure have \\"American-sized\\" appetites.\\n\\n7 bucks gets you one of their famous Speed dogs. It's a giant Pearl dog butterflied and soaked in a brown sugar/apple cider concoction before being chucked onto the grill. Sugar exterior = better caramelization. Order it loaded and you'll get it with mustard, house relish, caramelized onions and house bbq sauce.\\n\\nNow this dog is a large dog. Unfortunately it's also an extremely messy dog. The key is to wolf it down as quickly as possible before you realize or care that your hands are dirty. People who like to do the small \\"nibble, put food down, blot face, repeat\\" will not be pleased with getting a Speed dog. For me personally, I found it a bit on the sweet side; the sweet pre-soak along with the sweet relish, sweet onions and sweet bbq made me really want a glass of water afterwards. However, all the different toppings really do somehow magically work together. And the behemoth of a dog will keep you full for many hours.\\n\\nDon't want a dog? 8 bucks gets you their pastrami sandwich. You get medium-thick slices of pastrami chucked onto the grill to give them a slight smokey char before they're put into the bun (same kind as the dog). You can probably get any toppings you want, but with pastrami, typically mustard will do just fine. The pastrami itself is excellent; it's got a good amount of fat (without being too fatty), and the grill treatment brings up the temperature without drying the meat out. I typically like the \\"New York style\\" thick slices of pastrami myself, but Chef Gregg serves up a decent pastrami sandwich. He actually says he likes it even more than the dogs that he serves (SHOCKER).\\n\\nAnyways, they close when they sell out, so get there early. There might also be lines and waiting a long long time under the hot sun when you're hungry sucks, so that's another reason to get there early too. If you get there REAL early, you can order a dog, go into Boston and chill for an hour or two, THEN head out and get another dog before they close (I did this once...).

NYC doesn't have a choice, being mostly located on an island, so it can only grow up, not out. Atlanta has no such excuse.

Garlic butter) which I felt was a good idea as I know some people don't prefer an unadulterated steak.\\n\\nThe wine list is very nice, having pretty much the good bang-for-the-buck wines that should go nicely with beef.\\n\\nThe environment is classic Rat Pack-like with high-backed booths lining the walls, which help keeps the noise down.\\n\\nThe service has almost always been perfect, but recently (Nov-Dec 2007) I had two visits which went so horribly that I had to write in.

Located in the busy core of Richmond, Suhang is usually quite packed and it is recommended for customers to make reservations.  We have personally been eating at Suhang for over three years and their food and service has consistently been top notch!

(Perhaps we'll make another Suhang post but dine-in)\\n\\nSteamed Soup Buns with Pork Filling  - $5.50 (5.75/7)\\nNormally we would give these a 6, but they just didn't taste as amazing when in a Styrofoam box.  However, the quality of this dish was impeccable as the small buns were filled with a plethora of hot steaming soup!\\n\\nPan-Fried Pork Soft Buns  - $6.95 (5.5/7)\\nThese are actually steamed meat buns that are fried at the bottom using a wok!  Eating the bun is a bit difficult because if you bite too hard, the soup inside will spray everywhere.  However, we love this bun because of the steamy soup and it's definitely a classic dish that you have to try!  Unfortunately, we didn't get to devour this dish until 15 minutes after it was prepared so it ended up a bit soggy.\\n\\nMinced Pork with Noodles  - $6.95 (6/7)\\nThis dish remained the same as if we were eating it in the restaurant!  The thick meat sauce and the crisp cucumbers perfectly complemented each other and even though this particular noodle dish is quite heavy, we couldn't stop ourselves from finishing the whole thing!\\n\\nAnyways, Suhang is really the place to be when you feel like Xiao Long Bao (Little Dragon Dumplings?)

Some of the best vegan fine dining we've had in Portland. \\n\\nI'd love to give them 5 stars -- the atmosphere and service were as perfect as our food --however  I would like to see at least one vegan dinner starter on the menu. They have several vegetarian items, and I don't think it's too much to ask that one appetizer be free of animal products. After all, they have vegan dessert options; all that's missing is the starter option. \\n\\nI am looking forward to our next visit.

This pizza maybe the best in Boston.  Sadly though it is far short from the best in the nation.  I did not try their bbq skewers of sausage, lamb, and steak tips though I have to try that next time.  This review is just for the pizza. I ordered the pepperoni garlic and peppers pizza.  When I got the pizza the crust looked well done to over done. The crust was actually burnt in some areas.  The crust was tough and hard.  The sauce was better then normal however I was shocked to find out they don't make their own sauce.  They get it from some Italian company.  The toppings and cheese was pretty good dand had good flavor, but the crust kind of ruined it for me.  Maybe next time I tell them to take my pizza out a couple of minutes early.  It tasted like it was baked in a brick or stone oven.  I was told it's just a regular oven.  Would I recommend this place to others it's a toss up. One down side to it.

I happened to be in that neighborhood while it was happening and I SAW it, and it literally BURNED TO THE GROUND! Absolutely nothing left. Lucky for me I live South anyway.\\n\\nI like this place. They have probably the largest buffet selection of any Chinese buffet I've been to. There are DOZENS of items to select from.\\n\\nThey have all the regular Chinese dishes you'd expect, and a very extensive Sushi selection as well.  Me, I'm not a Sushi fan, but I have friends who like the quality, and REALLY like the fact that you can get a lot more food than you can at a \\"by-the-plate\\" restaurant.  OK, so it's not \\"Uchi quality\\", or so I would expect. I dunno cuz like I said, I don't care for Sushi. But for what you'd spend at Uchi for one meal, for a decent amount of food, you could eat ALL WEEK at BP . If you can afford Uchi, try 'em. Then go to BP at least ONCE & compare. That goes as well for any of you who've already been to Uchi. Try BP at least once; just wear a disguise so you won't be \\"seen\\". Anyone tries both, PLEASE WRITE ME; I'd like to know, from a Sushi aficionado, how they feel about it.\\n\\nBP doesn't list PRICES on their 'site, but I sorta disagree with the $$ overall rating they get. That might be true for dinner (barely) but I usually go for lunch, and not including a glass of iced tea, the buffet itself is UNDER $10.  \\n\\nI've tried many items (but not everything). Of my tastings, the only things I really didn't care for were: the Spicy Seafood Soup. Broth and vegetables were tasty, but gave up on peeling the shrimp or getting any meat out of the tiny crabs. And messy; had to wash my hands before continuing. Just take shrimp and crab out cuz the soup is great, and you still get the flavor from them. And, some Korean concoction that was in a red garlic sauce; NO, not at all! Sauce was very pasty and it really didn't have much flavor to me. \\n\\nI didn't make notes on what all I had, never do. Next time I go, I WILL make a list and give more of a \\"bite-by-bite\\" accounting of each dish in an update.\\n\\nIf BP were a sit-down, full-service restaurant, with a more limited selection, I might give a lower rating than what I give here. But for those who've read some of my other reviews, I take into account what a given restaurant is TRYING TO BE & in this case factoring in the sheer number of dishes and OVERALL quality (hey, can YOU simultaneously prepare maybe 30-40 items and have them ALL come out satisfactory?). \\n\\nIf a place has poor decor but the food and service are good, they're gonna get a higher rating than a really fancy place that has poor food, bad service, or both. Perry's Steakhouse? I gave 'em 5 Stars; they're upscale and very expensive, and they've EXCELLENT. That's what they're TRYING to be, and they've succeeded. Tucci's Southside Subs is obviously a sub shop. Not much in the way of decor, fairly inexpensive, and I gave them 5 Stars; they're not trying to be Perry's, just a plain ol' sub shop that serves the best sub in Austin, and THEY'VE succeeded. THEY are excellent. They're BOTH 5 Star places, even though price and decor are different. I've already got reviews posted for them, and as you can tell I try to give a detailed review as to WHY I like/dislike a place. I can't stop at: \\"The food was good\\" or \\"the food was bad\\". That's not even worth the time to write (or read). I've been to most of the Chinese buffets down south. Most are OK, one is really not very good; Buffet Palace is head-and-shoulders above them ALL.\\n\\nI recommend Buffet Palace, especially if you live close by. BTW, they also have a location in Killeen, near Ft. Hood. Go check 'em out. NOW!\\n\\nBTW, I recommend staying AWAY from the other BP, er, I mean BRITISH Petroleum.

When I've ordered in the restaurant before, it's been slow and sometimes comes out wrong, but I can fix it by sending the food back (not my favorite thing to do). Today when we picked up the order we asked them to confirm that they didn't include onions, cilantro or mayo on the food. They confirmed that to be the case and when we got back to our office...it had onions, cilantro and mayo! We officially give up! Pretty space but we have to feel confident about what we order since one person in our group has food allergies and can not eat onions! \\n\\n\\nUPDATE: Ordered for a group today (4 people) and BarTaco forgot several items we ordered (including someones main entree type item) so we had to GO BACK to the restaurant.

The burger was a goat cheese burger and my only complaint is that it was too small. I will say that the sushi isn't the best sushi I've had and it definitely could be better but it wasn't bad either. My friend got the chipotle bison burger and said it was good although I did not try it. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well.

I loved the lighting, atmosphere and company was pleasant so I was pretty open minded with the food. \\nAs a heath conscious eater, I'm kinda wary of eating out because I'm never sure of the options available. And paying $10 for a salad? No. Just no. I can make those salads at home. \\nSo with my eating habit, I was grateful to learn that BJ's have the \\"Enlightened Entrees\\", which are all under 575 calories. I chose the Creole Tilapia simply because I like fish and tomatoes. My two friends got the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi and a shrimp pasta dish, the name of which I couldn't remember. The guy who's not driving got a Jeremiah Red. \\nThe food came out about 10 minutes later, which I think is decent. My dish was pretty decent. The fish is well-cooked, the sauce is good, the side salad is not bad. For those who don't eat too salty like me, know that the tapenade is salty because of the anchovies. On the health perspective, the dish is pretty balanced: a third each of grain, protein and vegetables. Overall, I would eat it again. \\nMy friends had no complaints about their dishes.\\nThe Jeremiah Red, I had  a small sip of at the beginning of the meal, is good even though I don't drink beer in general. We ordered a triple chocolate pizookie because we heard it was good. Personally, I was way to rich for me so sharing was a good idea. While it was good and my friends did enjoy it to, we didn't finish it simply because it was so rich. I am glad to go back to my 72% dark chocolate and home made ice cream after that. \\n\\nOne complaint, the waiter was terrible with refilling water, terrible enough that one of friend got a bit mad and gave only $1 tip. And I got thirsty enough that I asked to drink from my friend's cup. \\n\\nI will probably come back, although not anytime soon."},{"name":"Engine House Pizza","address":"71 Lafayette St","city":"Salem","stars":"3","text":"Best pizza in Boston.\\nAmazing crust, so much cheese.

Like most restaurants at that time, it was pretty quiet.  The entire front of the place was full of open tables.  The hostess asked us to wait in the bar area for 10 minutes before we could be seated.  I thought it was strange, but we were both really hungry and didn't question the hostess.  The two of us awkwardly stood by the bar watching the tv because we didn't want a drink.  There were two other people having drinks at the bar.  Several minutes later, we saw the hostess put two menus on a table right in front of us.  We both waited for her to get us, since it was obviously our table.  No one else was waiting for a table.  We waited, and waited and waited while watching our empty table.  My husband decided we should leave, as this was absolutely ridiculous, but at that time she walked around the corner to seat us.  Again, we were really hungry so we sat down at our table.  That alone ruined our experience at this restaurant.  I assume the wait was a push to drink at the bar.  The icing on the cake was the waiter that re-filled my water glass also poured half of it down my leg.  He said he was sorry, but he left a huge puddle of water on the floor by my feet.

So this was a must stop. We came around 5 pm on a weekend and there was a really long line. I think we waited about half an hour, just to pay. This is probably one of their most popular locations because it's right downtown. It was the longest wait ever, it felt like. And then we had to wait another 15 minutes for them to get our order together. There were only two guys in front working. One half taking orders and half putting together orders. And the other guy dedicated to putting together bigger orders. Both were moving super slowly also. Like no sense of urgency. But people will wait no matter how slow they are, I guess. I maybe won't come back to this location though. Since it was late in the day, I don't think they had as much variety. But we still found plenty to try. We had the passion fruit cocoa nib, chocolate almond ganache, PB&J, and blueberry bourbon basil. All were delicious.  Only the PB&J was a filled donut and the rest of the regular fried ones. My favorite was the passion fruit. It's my fav flavor even though it also has some chili powder or something because it's slightly spicy. Each donut is about 2-4 bucks so it can add up.

Basically it's set up like a chipotle style with all the fresh ingredients and you can add what ever you like to make it your own. They have plenty of options to chose from, like bacon, other proteins, endless veggies, and cheeses. Plus I split the sweet crepe with granola and the more popular sweet crepe with Nutella, bananas, and strawberries. I preferred the Nutella crepe because of that chocolate taste but the other was good, just a little too much peanut butter for me. \\n\\nHint: ask them to split the crepe for you and they will cut it ahead of time and prepare it on different plates that way you don't have to worry about it after the fact and mess it up.

It took me back to my Tollhouse days. The only problem was that the cookie fell apart really easily, so I had to eat it in small bits.\\n\\nThe cupcake was also really tasty, especially with the subtle vanilla frosting and the fresh blackberries places on top (going forward, I want all of my cupcakes to have fresh berries on top of them). The cake portion of the cupcake was acceptable, but just slightly dry and dense; had it been moister and fluffier, it would have been the perfect cupcake.\\n\\nLastly, the whoopie pie was really awesome. It was basically a banana bread peanut butter sandwich. It not only tasted great, but also felt almost healthy; I think the idea of using banana bread as sandwich slices is a clever one, as well. Also, this whoopie pie was way better than the more traditional chocolate and creme-filling one I had from Vegan Treats.\\n\\nIf Pattycake had more seating and offered some loose-leaf teas (strangely, they sell loose-leaf tea by the packet, but don't offer individual cups of it, even though they do offer cups of coffee), it would be the perfect vegan bakery.

At this point, I let it go because my boyfriend was nearly finished with his duck.

Totally new menu. Upgraded decor.\\n\\nI  had the stuffed Pacific shrimp wrapped in bacon & grilled on wooden skewers. Kind of like I would do it at home on the bbq grill in the early summer. Except that, this night, it was 9¬∞ outside. \\n\\nWhen I stuck one of the warm, cozy, blanketed shrimp with a fork, white cheese oozed out as if it had been impaled by a Roman spear in a cheap Italian movie. I sometimes like cheap Italian movies. If the actors performed like these shrimp, I might order a boxed set from Amazon. But, as we all know about film--Italian or otherwise--there's more to a great movie-going experience than the performances.\\n\\nHaving received some useful feedback from a fellow Yelper, I sampled all of the food items on my plate before adding my personal salsa. Thanks, Keith.\\n\\nThe rice was white and tasteless. I think if you're going to put something on the plate (other than a napkin), it ought to taste different than Charmin. Otherwise, just pass out a coupon for the TP and save the cooking energy. You might even get some sort of a \\"green award\\" by doing so. Thumb down.\\nBut, I digress...\\n\\nThe beans were served in a small crucible (without specific reference to Salem witches) and were pretty tasty. Pinto beans, onions, a couple of other things (unidentifiable in the dim light), and a broth thick enough to eat with a spoon without leaning over the table too much. Thumb up.\\n\\nThe vegetables were sauteed about right, and plentiful. In fact, this was a real plus for this dish. Good variety. Good flavor. Good texture. Thumb up.\\n\\nThe headliner of the dish, the stuffed & wrapped shrimp, were overcooked a bit (which is typical of most local restaurants, I sadly report), making the bacon dry, and the shrimp too firm. A pity. They had a potential winner and squandered the opportunity. Alas, an also-ran at the culinary racetrack. No studding service for this dish. At least not tonight. Thumb down.\\n\\nThe schooner of Negra Modelo was large & cold & fairly inexpensive. An excellent combination. The service was good--about midway between nagging and cold-case. Thumb up.\\n\\nThe lady sitting next to me said that the flan was good. It looked a little too embellished to me. Flan should stand up (literally) on its own. I assume it  tasted OK, though, because she ate is slowly without setting her fork down. Didn't try it, can't opine.\\n\\nLastly, if you might need to make/take a phone call, you'd have to be Foghorn Leghorn to be understood and have bionic ears to hear. Seriously. The music was Selena-Gomez-concert loud. Is this a trend everywhere? Ears down.\\n\\nTherefore, as I finally reach the bottom line of this semi-stream-of-consciousness soliloquy, I must reduce my previous rating a star to numero tres. Las Margaritas does get an honorary \\"Miss Congeniality\\" award for trying hard to get along with really good Latino restaurants.

We all have pretty different tastes, but I can say that the fact that the experience was excellent was something we definitely all agreed on. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Inviting West Coast style... Sort of like a California beach shack. Casual and cool with attention to detail. Had it been a prettier day we would have loved to dine on the patio, but now we have a great excuse to come back!\\n\\nService: excellent. They have a unique ordering system where you place the entire table's order on a piece of paper to streamline things, but our server also went above and beyond this method of service. \\n\\nFood: Drool worthy. Ordered the guacamole, corn and three tacos (duck, wild boar, sesame ribeye). The gauc and corn were uncomplicated, but executed very well. Our entire table ordered the corn and devoured it. The tacos I ordered were a little more ambitious, slightly over seasoned, but delicious nonetheless. I surprisingly enjoyed the ribeye the best, but liked that bartaco offers more gamey proteins. We finished with the churros which were had the perfect crisp outside and doughy inside ratio.\\n\\nDrinks: a pear sangria. A refreshing complement to the flavorful tacos.

On Monday and Tuesday they do offer a fixed price cheap date menu. There were some particular dishes we wanted to try so we skipped this, but it looks well worth trying if you're short on cash. We started with the scallion pancakes which were delicious. Made with flour from Flour Bakery it was flaky and toasted and tasted light and airy, not greasy at all! Thanks to Dan C. I had to try the tea infused spare ribs and I'm glad I did! They were amazing with an interesting flavor from the tea but still maintained the pork flavor. The pork belly buns were tasty, but make sure you are okay with pork belly which tends to be fatty. The hoisin sauce was sweet and spicy. The panko crusted lemon chicken was wonderful. A nice lemony taste and the light crusting went very well together. A side of baby bok choy was fine, similar to what you would get in Chinatown. All of the desserts looked great since they do come from Flour Bakery, but I'm glad I chose the bittersweet chocolate cake with Vietnamese coffee sauce, yummmyyy! This is my sweet tooth talking.\\n\\nNow be prepared to pay more than what you are used to from a restaurant in Chinatown since this is the South End.

The girl was super slow working it too! Once you ordered, you then had to wait for them to call you to get your order. Voodoo has crowd control and service down and we've never waited more than 20 minutes there for an equally long line. When we finally got up to the front, it was an underwhelming experience. Plus, each donut was nearly $4! The donuts were ok but not amazing like I expected. I was very interested in trying the maple bacon.

The crab Rangoon dip is wonderful and had that both times but getting thee rest of the meal right has proven to be a challenge. My wife ordered the Boursin burger without mushrooms the first time. When the burgers came hers was covered in mushrooms. We notified the waitress and a manager came and said he'd take care of it and have a new burger out shortly without mushrooms. The burger did com out fairly quick and without mushrooms, however, my wife had ordered medium well and it came out rare. We told the waitress again and just asked her to forget it as I was done with my food by then. The manager did try to make it right and comped the entire meal and gave us cards for 2 free appetizers. We chalked it up to growing pains since they'd only been open a short time.\\n\\nFast forward a month and we decided to give it another try. We got the crab Rangoon dip again with one of the free appetizer cards and my wife wanted to try the Boursin burger and again asked for medium well and no mushrooms. We were assured this wouldn't be a problem this time.  The burgers came and guess what, yep, hers was covered in mushrooms again. She told the waitress who offered to take it to the kitchen and try to get the mushrooms off of the burger. We declined and told her to forget about it.  About 5 minutes later a manager came over and said he wanted to make things right.  He offered to have the mushrooms removed from the burger in the kitchen and put fresh bacon on it or have a new one made if we wanted to wait 20 minutes. Again we declined as we didn't have an extra 20 minutes since we'd already been there for 45 minutes and I don't think trying to wipe the mushrooms off of the burger I'm paying $14 for is an appropriate solution. I shared my burger and about 10 minutes later the kitchen manager shows up at the table with another Boursin Burger with no mushrooms after we'd told them to forget about it. She said no charge and she'd have it boxed up since we were ready to go. We asked for water to go and she said she'd have the waitress take care of it. The waitress came with the check but no water she said she forgot but would be right back. 10 minutes passed and she's off waiting on other tables so we gave up on the water and paid what remained of the bill and left the free appetizer card and \\ndetermined we'd give up on going back and hoping they could finally get their act together and get our orders right.

I tried other macaroons from other bakeries in DownTown Vancouver and these were the best & a bit bigger than the other ones. It's about $15 for 7 & $25 for 12. You can buy it individually for $2. In my opinion they're better than the Macaroons at Payard Patisserie & Bistro, in Ceasar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV USA. It's like the Sprinkles Cupcakes for Macaroons.....

No old people, no babies screaming and no Denny's vibe.  Just the way I like it.  The only real draw back for me is rude wait staff.  I haven't got the rude girl for a while, but when I get her she does not disappoint.  You have to have a penis for her to condescend a smile at you with your eggs.  Whatever.  Most of the time I think the waitstaff works hard and the chefs work harder.  I don't think it's that expensive.

I walk in and am immediately impressed by the size of this location we see the hostess who immediately tells us she can sit us but the kitchen is behind and we can't order food for 15 minutes..... nice lead in for first time guests. We then question about outside dining to which she went to check if anything was available. 5+ minutes later we see her come through the kitchen, talk with a few other staff members and then come back to the host station and tell us she can seat us outside but we will have to wait 10 minutes because of the kitchen being behind. Of course we thought this was ridiculous and offered to sit and not order anything but she blamed it on her manager who we then asked to speak to. He proceeded to tell us they would seat us in 5 that they needed to clear a table, making a lot more sense if that was the case.\\n\\nFinally we are sat grab some beers and place our order for dinner. I ordered the steak tips, garlic mashed and broccoli. While the steak tips were well marinated and had good flavor the sides were not good. They actually made and error and provided us the incorrect vegetable giving me the opportunity to try the corn, broccoli and garlic mashed. The garlic mashed was very thick and lacking in flavor. The broccoli tasted like low quality frozen veggies it was plain steamed - it even already started to brown. The corn was waterlogged. Probably not too overcooked to start but it had clearly been sitting in water for quite some time and retained that.\\n\\nIn order to spend our groupon we ordered dessert to split chocolate chip cookie pie. It was literally like 3 peggy lawton cookies (yes market basket shoppers...)  with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, some overly large puff pastry and whipped cream.

The star of this operation is the expansive sidewalk caf√©, and if the weather isn't right for outdoor seating, then the indoor space has floor to ceiling windows that make you feel like you're outside. We consider observing the street scape part of the evening's entertainment so we always take a window table, but there is also a very convivial horseshoe shaped bar where regulars and newcomers mingle happily. Everyone always looks relaxed and like they're having a great time (which I feel is unusual in the Boston area).\\n \\nMy husband, who has travelled in Spain extensively, says this is the tapas bar that makes him feel like he is back there, not just because of the menu, but because of the comfortable, friendly vibe, and interestingly, the architecture of the building. It is a type of modern that the Spanish do so well - modern but graceful, never sterile. Don't put too much stock in the interior photos on Yelp - I think the place is much more beautiful and airy, expansive, than the photos might lead you to think. \\n\\nAs for the food, there is a nice offering of tapas with all the standards but also offering seasonal variety. I particularly like the smokiness of the \\"Grilled Pulpo\\" (octopus), the \\"Crispy Oysters\\" which deliciously live up to their title with a light batter that is never greasy, and the many flavorful vegetable tapas which are given as much culinary attention as the protein offerings.\\nThe wine list gives us the opportunity to try many things by the glass that we would otherwise not find in the Boston area.\\n\\nThe service is attentive but relaxed, helpful and knowledgeable. I was shocked to learn after a couple of visits that this is part of a chain. Nothing about this place seems chain-like to me (chain usually being somewhat negative for us).\\n\\nGiven how fine the food and wine always are, we are always very surprised at how low the bill is compared to other places in Boston of a similar level of dining. Sometimes we are here for just a quick drink and a bite, sometimes we treat our visit as dinner, building a multi-course meal from the many options.

The menu is a mix of Korean cuisine and chicken.  Because of that, the menu is quite different than other restaurants around the area, and that is a big plus! We ordered some combo chicken (wings and drumsticks) and we also our first experience with bibimbap!  We elected for the seafood variation of bibimbap  (shrimp, scallops, octopus), and it was amazing!  Great flavor, textures, and colors in it.  The chicken was crispy, cooked almost perfect, and had just the right amount of sauce with it.   They had a solid selection of local brews, and it is such a great location in downtown Salem.  \\n\\nThe Bad:  Two major points here.  First is the service is fucking terrible.  We were there during a slow time and for the entirety of our visit, there were no more than two other parties seated.  In spite of this, the servers, there was one server and a bartender, were more interested in their phones and watching the World Cup than doing their jobs.  After they took our order, not once did they come over to check on us.  They did come over when we called upon them, but this should not be happening.  ( I have seen this happen many times in my career, but never so blatantly in front of customers.). The second thing is they have NO dessert.  They tried to recommend some nearby shops, but after a good meal,  it was a big disappointment to not have the option for something sweet.\\n\\nThe Ugly:    So the big thing here stems from them being a corporate chain.  There is no wiggle room for any special orders or customization (hopefully outside of any allergies.).  No sauce on side allowed for the chicken, and no upgrade on the standard sides for any of the dishes.  You need to purchase a totally separate side, which is annoying.  Did not ruin of experience by any means, just something to be aware of. \\n\\nFinal Word:  Overall, it is worth giving a try.  The food is fantastic,  and with the location it's in, you could easily walk it off if you wanted to (or walk to one of the many nearby bakeries/ sweet shops nearby for dessert. ).

In a neighborhood like West Broadway, places like Sophia's are hard to come by and should be encouraged to continue their investment in the area. Places like this bring residents, which bring development, which makes our neighborhood a better place.\\n\\nThe food I get from Sophia's is always solid. Never knocks my socks off, but it's good stuff. I haven't had breakfast or coffee there, so can't comment on that; only on the lunch menu.\\n\\nMy first problem with Sophia's arises every time I walk in the door. The staff is not warm and welcoming. They almost give off this vibe that they are annoyed to have to work.\\n\\nI also find the menu incredibly overwhelming. There are probably a hundred menu items or maybe even more. When you look around the cafe, there are another 30-40 items lying about for you to grab and go. There's a bakery case. There are empty refrigerator cases. How this place could need space for more food items, I'm not sure.\\n\\nFor a small neighborhood cafe, the quantity of offerings just seems silly. I'd rather see them have a small menu with a few rotating/seasonal items that is very easy to understand and quick to order from.\\n\\nOn the subject of quickness: Sophia's would get zero stars. A previous review from 2008 noted that they are incredibly slow; that has not changed in four years. It takes 10-15 minutes for one sandwich to be made. Now, this is a tough criticism because I know they're carefully putting the sandwich together -- it isn't rushed and it certainly isn't sloppy. They slice the tomatoes for your sandwich, for example; try getting that anywhere else.\\n\\nBut honestly, it's painfully slow. There's no reason they couldn't shave this time down -- and I think reducing the number of menu items, and thereby ingredients on hand, would streamline the process dramatically.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up:\\n\\nPros: Food tastes good, glad to see this type of place in an up-and-coming neighborhood.\\n\\nCons: Very slow, overwhelming menu, unfriendly staff."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The brisket delicious but totally covered in cracked black pepper which was only thing you could taste."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The minimalist decor is open and refreshing.

Both buns use wheat flour.\\n\\nDumplings are generally sold in sets of six, nine, or twelve, and you may customize your order. I got two of each dumpling, plus a curry veggie bao, just for something different.\\n\\nThere are five sauces: Asian chipotle, creamy peanut, soy ponzu, spicy hoisin, and Thai mustard. I decided to try the Asian chipotle (a red sauce), and the Thai mustard (yellow in color).\\n\\nPerfectly steamed products here. Of all the dumplings, the pork was my favorite. Just simple, explosive flavors with the garlic and ginger. I also loved the chicken dumpling here. Despite advertising chiles, I couldn't detect any spice. It's to be expected after destroying my spicy sensors many years ago.\\n\\nThe spinach one was also prepared well, but just didn't have the flavor burst the other two had.\\n\\nI enjoyed the curry veggie bao. Dough steamed nicely, with a delicious, balanced curry filling. I honestly would have liked more filling and less dough here. A cool presentation, having an open top to the bao so one can see what's inside.\\n\\nOf the two sauces I tried, Asian chipotle was the clear winner. A mix of sweet and tang, and a controlled kick from the chipotle. The Thai mustard was also good, but it basically lost via TKO to the chipotle. Those dang peppers simply knock out other contenders.\\n\\nLast, but not least, I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee ($2.50).

We got one round of drinks out of him then he took our orders and vanished. Other people ran our food out, leaving us to guess what kind of taco was on each of the three platters.

Of course, some drunk dude walked through the door and almost sent the heavy ladder onto 20 diners eating along the wall. I was done. Someone had to go fix the ladder, which this drunk idiot left ready to crash. When he tried to tell a server the server treated him like he was the A-H. \\nManagement has reached out and been very nice.

The pastry chef is Thierry  Busset from Cin Cin.  I had been looking forward to tasting these pastries for months.  I tried the Opera Cake and two flavours of macarons - coconut and pistachio.  The Opera Cake was very good but not what I expected.  It is an interpretation that I found a bit sweet and not the texture I prefer.  The bottom layer was crunchy, not cakey like the traditional one.  I was disappointed with this.  Based on this one cake, I would say that Thomas Haas has better cakes.  I look forward to trying other cakes to see how they stack up.\\n\\nThe outstanding product was the macarons.  They were well priced, well made and absolutely delicious.  The coconut was a real treat if you are a coconut fan.  The real stand out was the pistachio.

We sat at the last two open bar seats which worked perfect for us. The bartender, I believe her name was Billy, was absolutely amazing and so friendly! She explained the menu to us and had drinks in front of us in no time. \\n\\nNow for the menu. Um... wow! Talk about the most surprisingly awesome food pairings.

Our first dish arrived within 15 minutes of ordering and the server explained everything that went into it. I won't go through every one in detail, but let me just say...

That obviously didn't happen, but I'm sure he would have done it himself if we weren't so overwhelmed and in a state of drunken stupor at the foods that we had just eaten. We were shocked. We were amazed. We were in a food coma. We couldn't move and we didn't want to. We stayed until they started closing down the restaurant. At the point we finally got up to leave, the bartenders and servers gave us a super friendly goodbye/see ya next time.

Quite good, maybe could use a little more cheese (on the Italian Job, anyway; the mushroom pizza was plenty cheesy). The pasta carbonara was good, but a tad bland.

They added a lot of balsamic vinegar which made the spring mix unappetizing. It was a nice presentation but not worth the money. The entree was good though. We tried lamb, chicken, and beef.. all were excellent. Came with some salad and rice which was also good. The donor kebab was not the best I've tried but not bad either.

No feigned sincerity there. She helped us navigate the extensive wine list and we decided on a local sauvignon blanc (and ended up getting a second one, which by the way the allowance to cork and bring home the remainder makes all too much sense).\\n\\nFish and chips is a meal so hard to resist. But at a place like this with so many fresh, non-fried options, it would have been a shame to waste a main course on just fish and chips. That's where the appetizer menu comes to the rescue. They have \\"fish and chip cones\\" - little edible paper cones with a mini fish and chips combination inside. A survey of all three \\nat our table reveals that they are a winner!\\n\\nWe were also given a complimentary dish of three oysters. After brief coaching, we all gave our first go of it. An appreciated gesture from the restaurant, yet don't think oysters will make it into my rotation anytime soon.\\n\\nFor dinner we made the following decisions and shared: Sable Fish, Halibut, Lobster Mac & Cheese, Hand Cut Frites and Fried Brussel Sprouts. Both of the cuts of fish were of a healthy size, accompanied by rice and fresh vegetables. The halibut had great flavor, very \\"buttery\\" but not overwhelming. The only thing that we couldn't finish was the mac & cheese. The portion was fairly large and compared to the other items, it simply lost the taste battle.\\n\\nWe had two items for dessert: NY Cheesecake and the Lollipop Trio. I'll be honest that the description of the lollis was not drawing me in but the ladies wanted them. And it turns out, they weren't that good.

She gave us a quick tour of the buffet and sat us quickly. The first thing she told us was that the buffet was $14. It was printed in big numbers at the top of the menu, BUFFET - $14. This is odd, considering how on Yelp at the moment they are advertising a $10 buffet special (Monday through Friday, 11am-3pm!) and on April 1 they updated their facebook with the same thing. I do NOT like to be scammed, and I especially don't like it when this is my sell point to get people to come with me to try out your restaurant. I was extremely disappointed, so minus 1 star for you!  \\n\\nOur server was quick to come to the table, fill our waters, and explain the menu. Buffet is $14, but only $6 if you add it on to the Entree. Most of the other lunch options ranged from $9 (sandwiches, burgers ) to $16+ (kebabs, full-on entrees). This is quite pricey for a lunch, but we all carried on. 2 of us chose buffet, the other 2 chose sandwiches.\\n\\nBread came out a few minutes after we got back from the buffet, and I have been told it is fantastic. I thought it was... fine. Plain bread, but fresh or in other words, squishy. Olive oil was plain jane. Why are people raving about this?\\n\\nThe buffet is mainly side dishes. They did have some gyro meat which I thought was fair- juicy, cut right off the shank brazilian steakhouse style, but little seasoning. They had a big plate of fruit, potato salad, a make-your-own salad thing, and a bunch or random dishes that I have no clue what they were. Literally. \\n\\nProbably 75% of the items on the (tiny) buffet were not labeled. Don't get me wrong, everything I had was fresh and delicious, but I had no clue what I was eating! They seem to really cater to the international crowd that knows what's up with Mediterranean food.  If I was a vegetarian, I probably would have loved this buffet as there were all sorts of goodies that did not have meat...but as a carnivore, I felt like this buffet was just a mish-mash of side items. So now it makes sense why you might want to add on this buffet to an entree- because the buffet itself is not really a meal.\\n\\nMy buffet-mate and I were probably halfway through our dishes before our other friends got their meals. The sandwiches they got looked AWESOME. They both said it tasted pretty good too. I will give Truva some credit - all of their food tastes fresh, and from scratch. All of their food LOOKS fresh and from scratch. I'm impressed.\\n\\nOverall, I was left wanting a little more- well actually a little less, in price. But more in terms of value. I imagine I would have felt differently about my experience if every table was full (as I know some other places downtown that are constantly busy but their food sucks and people return there anyway). I really did not feel like $14 was a good price for the buffet, and other lunch items should have been much more reasonably priced.

The first visit, we had absolutely amazing food, the second visit was quite bad, and the third visit was again stellar.  I have to wonder what happened during our second visit (cook out sick? new staff?), as this place is typically ALWAYS busy and that's not a reason for quality to dwindle.\\n\\nOne thing I will say -- if you're in a hurry, DO NOT GO HERE.  They are always limited on staff (who are super friendly, just incredibly busy) and this place is pretty small, so chances are you will wait for a table.  Once your order is taken (this can sometimes even take a while once you're seated), food and drinks come quickly, and the food is typically pretty great (and has vegetarian options!!).  \\n\\nThe menu has a Southern flair, but offers plenty of veggie options, with tofu scrambles and egg dishes with no meat.  My last visit I had the Sunrise Benedict, which was absolutely DELISH.  Char-grilled tomato slice on top of avocado slices, poached eggs and chipotle hollandaise.  Umm, hello, amazing.  The sides are potatoes or grits and all of their pastries/ biscuits are baked in house.  The bread is thick cut and seeded, so I assume they bake them in house, and if not, it's definitely fresh/ local.

The macarons were alright, I thought the cookie was a bit heavy handed and thick, but the filling was good!

It really was dirty and they have cleaned up the place. However, it is not to the standard I believe it should be in.

The seasoning on the tibs is more tomatoey and garlicky than I've had elsewhere--something mildly Italian about it--and delicious.  The very popular tilapia tibs can be faulted for being a little dry sometimes, but is overall a well executed and unique dish.  My favorites are the lamb and beef tibs though, in that order.  The meat flavor really come through in these.  The kitfos and fit-fits are fine (very fresh tasting), but I always find them too mild when you can order tibs instead.  The vegetable sides are mostly excellent and the menu is helpful in describing each of them.  An all vegetarian combo platter is a very good option and will not leave you feeling too heavy, and it's an excellent option to pair with a meat/fish tibs if you are sharing with other people.  Which brings me to the portion size:  most tibs are really big and cost $10~12 and I generally feel like I eat too much.  Basically 3 tibs dishes would be enough for 4 people.  Maybe the option to get smaller portions will work well.  \\n\\nService is very friendly and I just love the feel of Desta.  Some Ethiopian restaurants can be drab, but Desta is lively and has a great patio, people are always having a good time.

Our waitress was incredibly sweet and knew when to check in on us and when to leave us be. This gave us plenty of time to talk and eat without feeling rushed; she always seemed to arrive just when we needed her.\\n\\nI had the Spicy Tuna Burger, which exceeded my expectations. Most places sear a piece of fish, plop it on a bun, and call it a day, but not these guys. The yellowfin shone just on its own and the pickled ginger made every bite taste fresh. I asked for the chipotle mayo on the side and have to say that it was delicious, but you could easily enjoy the burger without it -- I actually forgot it was on my plate until the end, that's how good the base ingredients were.\\n\\nMy father had the Mexican Meatball Sub, which we both agreed was great. Usually, a meatball sub is all bread and no meat, but Parish Cafe doesn't stand for that. There's a good balance of both and the bread is more like a baguette, so no soggy rolls here. The meat was well-seasoned and spicy, setting it apart from the Italian original.\\n\\nIn the past, I've had their Parish Chicken Sandwich and the Zuni Roll, both of which I would recommend. Also, their battered onion rings are awesome.

What is America's obsession with becoming skinny? Let's look at some statistics, shall we?\\n\\n* Up to 24 million people, of all ages and genders, suffer from an eating disorder in the United States (including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder). \\n* Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.\\n* Over one-half of teenage girls and nearly one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives.\\n* 69% of girls in 5th-12th grade reported that magazine pictures influenced their idea of a perfect body shape.\\n* 81% of 10 year olds are afraid of being fat.\\n\\nThose are just a few of the many statistics out there, but it's a concerning trend. Seriously, eighty-freaking-one percent of 10 year olds are afraid of being fat? Girls in the fourth and fifth grade should be worrying about anything else other than their weight. These disordered patterns of thinking start young, and we're surrounded by a society that is constantly telling us we are not thin enough. That is no way to live. \\n\\nI realize that this might seem like a paltry issue to most, and most people probably don't put so much thought into where they spend their money, but I can't just turn a blind eye to this issue. Most people probably think the name is cute and say, \\"Yay! They are promoting a healthy lifestyle!\\" I'm all for that - being healthy is wonderful - but healthy comes in all shapes and sizes. Why this constant push for skinny?  There is no limit to what people will do to become skinny; people die for the pursuit of thinness.\\n\\nObviously, I had severe reservations about their business model. I didn't need yet another thing encouraging my poor eating habits. Browsing their website showed a host of juice cleanses and, in my warped brain, I saw it as, \\"Oh, wow, look - just drink juice for a few days and think of all the weight you could potentially lose. And it would be healthy.\\" That's just fucked, you know? \\n\\nOf course, not everyone has this mindset, and some people can approach the idea of a juice cleanse in a perfectly normal and healthy manner. The problem is that many of us cannot, for whatever reason. This isn't the fault of the business, but it would be nice if there wasn't yet another voice in the endless slew of \\"lose weight\\" chants. \\n\\nWith that being said, I do love juice and couldn't resist. I've tried the Firefly, which is made to order and consists of pineapple, lemon, apple, and mint, and the Pure and Simple, which is a cold pressed juice that consists of kale, cucumber, spinach, apple, parsley, celery, and lemon. Both were absolutely delicious and I could drink them every day of the week. The Pure and Simple is used in many, if not all, of their juice cleanses, which I find pretty exciting because it is just so yummy. \\n\\nMy favorite part of this trailer? It smells so wonderfully good on the inside. The lovely produce smell just wafts out of there and it is heaven. Imagine getting to stand inside that all day long. I imagine that's why the people who work there are so happy. I'd be really happy, too, if I got to smell wonderful fruit and vegetable smells and drink juice for a living. \\n\\nYes, I know that it probably doesn't make sense that I would type up a diatribe and then sing praises about the product, but I love juice and these people know how to make good juice. All feelings about the name aside, they produce a really high quality product, and I have to give credit where credit is due. \\n\\nThe beautiful thing about life is that I can hold both opinions at the same time; it doesn't have to be one or the other.  Will I still purchase and consume their juice? Absolutely. Will I still discuss how the name is harmful in a society that puts too much pressure on individuals to look a certain way? Yes. Love the juice, just not the ideology. \\n\\n** All statistics retrieved from: http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/"},{"name":"Pollo Campero","address":"Disney Marketplace, 1590 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"This was one of my favorite dining stops during our Disney trip.

I remember how much I loved them when I was there, so I jumped at the chance to have them again here in Portland. I ordered one with pork, beans, and cheese, as I was quite hungry at the time. \\n\\nI've never seen a pupusa as big as the one I had at the Honduran Tamale Factory before. One was a small meal! At $3.50 a pop, that's a good deal. That said, I wasn't exactly blown away by what I had. Way more doughy than those I'd had from the little Salvadoran caf√© in Guatemala, it was rather bland, and had relatively little pork, cheese, or beans in it, with most of the room taken up by tortilla. Not at all the little pocket of flavor I remembered. That said, it wasn't bad, and a meal for $3.50 that tastes decent is still a valuable thing in its own right. \\n\\nMy coworkers liked their meals better, generally. I tried the platanos that one of them had, and found them to be  good, though not on the level of some others I've had in Portland. While I didn't get to try the carne asada plate, my other coworker seemed relatively satisfied with it. Also, if you're trying to give your food some more fire, they also have a great array of hot sauces set up for diners to choose from. If I'm in the area again and come back here, I'll definitely avail myself.\\n\\nHonduran Tamale Factory is a really inviting place. I had a nice chat with one of the cooks (I think he's also the owner?), who later came out and joined our table and talked about Last Thursday and city politics with us for a nice while. The fact that it has a covered patio set up with tables and chairs, and even bring the food out to you while you sit and wait makes it a place that's easy to just hang out at over a leisurely late-night dinner. \\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't say that this is a great cart, but it's not bad, either. If you're hungry for late-night grub, I can definitely see this being an option. The best thing about this cart, though, is not its food, but its hospitality.

The buffet itself, outside of salad, has some interesting soup varieties, and I enjoy how they tend to change the theme each month or so to ensure you don't get tired of the same old thing. \\n\\nWhere I feel they fall short though is actual taste of some of their food.  The soups honestly leave something to be desired, and many that I have thought would just be great end up being meh.  Same goes for the pasta station, where it just seems that whatever they tend to cook up over there just always feels so under seasoned.  I know, it might be picky for a buffet, but it is what it is.

Luckily the menu is pretty straightforward; burgers ($4.39-$9.69), fries ($2.99) and frozen custard items (also a chicken sandwich/$6.49 and hot dogs/$3.39-$4.69).  \\nThe burgers are angus beef cooked medium on buttered potato buns, offered in single and double patties. It's a good burger, fresh and definitely a step above fast food. The crinkle cut fries were liberally salted.

I would have to say that regardless of the night, the staff isn't equipped to handle patrons...\\n\\nMy wife and I arrived on a Wednesday night just after 7pm.  Only about 4 tables had patrons sitting at them.  They had a table in the back corner, with a support beam extruding out to where the chair was.  That table was one of the only ones needing to be cleared, and they decided to put us there.  The most cramped table in the entire restaurant, when there were at least 8 other tables open.  That set the mood for our evening.\\n\\nDirectly behind us there were 2 gentleman that were speaking Italian, rather loudly, the entire time.  They liked to swear, one of the guys loudly dropped the f-bomb a couple times, in English.  Well, apparently the table was important (maybe the owner, or a close friend of the owner).  The chef came out to talk to them half a dozen times, and the waitress checked up on them regularly.  Perhaps that's why our service was lacking... they were too focused on the table behind us?\\n\\nAfter being seated, we looked over the menus and decided what we wanted.  A woman came by to fill our water glasses, and I inquired about any dinner specials.  She snapped at me telling me my waitress would provide those...  OK, my bad.  Several minutes later our waitress came by, upon request she shared the dinner specials of the evening and we placed our orders.  My wife ordered a salad an asked for italian dressing.  We're at an Italian restaurant... they didn't have italian dressing.  All they had was vinaigrette; how peculiar!\\n\\nThe food came out in good time, and everything tasted fine.  Our waitress had checked up on us about 2 minutes after the food was dropped off and didn't come back for some time after that.  The bus-girl came to fill our water glasses and we asked for the check, since our waitress hadn't made it by in some time.  She cleared the plates.  5 minutes later our waitress came by and we again asked for the check.  \\n\\nSummary:\\nFood - Good/Average\\nAmbiance - Local family restaurant.

Our server walked us through the menu page by page and was a hoot! She recommended the crab Rangoon dip which we loved. Also it came out of kitchen looking very dramatic and exciting, which was a lot of fun!\\n\\nAll three of us ordered a Bento box to try a wide variety of their food. The Bento comes with a mini burger, sweet potato fries, Edamame, sushi, and cucumber salad. Two of us customized our boxes slightly, and the restaurant was really cool about it. I don't care for cucumber, so i substituted seaweed salad instead. My friend wasn't excited about the jalape√±o popper burger, so they let her sub a regular bacon cheeseburger instead. \\n\\nThe food itself was just okay. Not the best sushi in the city, nor the best burger. I did really enjoy the seaweed salad and the sweet potato fries, but the burger was somewhat dry and bland (even though it was jalape√±o popper), and the sushi was kind of \\"whatever\\" to me.

With so many other brunch places available in Allston, the menu for Breakfast Club never struck me as worth taking the trip down for despite the 4 star rating on Yelp. But one hungry weekend The Boy and I decided to get it delivered and needless to say, it served its purpose but we were underwhelmed.\\n\\nI got the Nutella French Toast. It came with a disproportionately large about of warm melty Nutella compared to the small about of whipped cream to balance it out. The most outrageous thing about this order was that a side of Hash was $8 ($1 or 2 below the price of a main dish) and if you look at the photo below, $8 got us this tiny box of a little too mushy for my tastes hash; also feature shredded carrots which probably contributes to the unusual hash texture. It's certainly a unique flavor but not worth $8 for both quality and portion. \\n\\nCan't say this delivery experience made me interested in actually physically visiting for breakfast/brunch."},{"name":"The Breakfast Club","address":"270 Western Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"This is a solid breakfast joint.

Honestly, we compared sizes and we both had the same sized sandwich except he paid more for it which was disappointing. We were too hungry to complain so we scarfed down our food. Overall the food was just good. The rolls were great, but the sandwich itself seemed a little bland. The hint of scallion cream cheese was a nice touch, but it was still lacking something. We plan on coming back and trying another sandwich that is more original and hope for something with more unique flavor. The mushroom tortellini was fantastic, and the chicken soup again was a little bland for my taste. Looking forward to coming back and trying something new.

We waited at least 20 minutes to get to the front of the line. Good thing is, the bar is to your left while waiting in line(so of course, I ordered a margarita... more on that later). When we finally ordered, it was pretty painless, but it would nice if they had instructions on the HUGE chalkboards so you can look at them while waiting in line. I think it might help the line go a little smoother/quicker.  None the less, we order our food and are told to go to table #2. Problem with that is, there is no rhyme or reason to the table numbering system and we had to search around the packed place to find our table, which inconveniently was right next to others waiting in line(because the line is so long, I feel like this one guy watched me eat my entire burger while waiting to order his..a little awkward). We thought it would take awhile for the food to come out because they were so busy but within 5 minutes we had our burgers(Classic Bacon & Cheese Burger & the El Diablo) as well as our fries & chili cheese sauce. Perfect... Now, time to devour!!\\n\\nThe Margarita was so good but not worth 7$. Dang.. those pricey drinks! My mistake with ordering the margarita was I had only had about 450 calories thus far during the day(crazy busy day at work=unable to eat much) and I had also just finished a 30 minute kickboxing workout. I was running on fumes. So mix that with a pretty strong margarita= tipsy me. I mean, I'm not complaining but I had to ask the hubs to drive home. Hahaha.. yes, I don't drink much at all, so when I do I am a lightweight ;) \\n\\nThe burgers were amazing!  It was definitely worth the wait and really the only reason I am giving this place 4 stars!\\n\\nThe French fries were delicious.  We finished all of them. I don't know if it was because we were so hungry or they were that good, but regardless.. we finished them all... every single one! \\n\\nThe Chili Cheese sauce is good but not great. I do like how they don't smother your fries but instead they put it on the side and you can choose to dip your fries or smother them yourself... definitely helps so your fries don't get soggy. \\n\\nMy husband tends to shy away from places like Hopdoddy merely because of the \\"flair\\". He doesn't like to pay extra for a \\"trendy place full of flair\\" but hey.. I'm glad we went. Although the wait was long & the setup to order/sit is awful, the end result of a delicious burger was worth it. I will definitely be going back :)"},{"name":"La Quercia","address":"3689 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I have been to this resto many times in the past and had really positive experience in terms of quality of food and service. Until this last experience, that is. My husband and I had a celebration dinner here with two other couples in October of 2016. We had made a reservation in advance and while we waited at the bar area, there was a large group of Chinese guests who appeared to be celebrating something. They were drinking a great deal, talking (more like yelling), laughing, and pushing each other to drink more - all at the top of their lungs. Other guests like ourselves were extremely uncomfortable at this boisterous behaviour, but nothing was done by the manager/owner of the resto. At one point, both my husband and I politely told a couple people at this large table that they were extremely loud, but they just replied very loudly, \\"We are celebrating!\\" I assure you that I am not being racist - I am Asian myself! It was an extremely uncomfortable experience and when our table was ready, we literally escaped that bar area. \\nThen at dinner, another unprofessional incident took place. As the food began to arrive, I politely asked our server if I could have some chilli flakes. He said in a rather condescending tone that they didn't have any, and that their kind of food was not supposed to be spiced. I asked if they had any hot sauce or chilli oil, and he replied, irritated, no. I commented in a still polite and friendly tone that most restos would have something that added a little spice to the food if the diner so desired. He told me that I should have brought my own! Our friends saw this and one of them confronted this server, named \\"Chris\\", near the kitchen area why he needed to be so rude to me, that I was only asking for a condiment. I guess the manager must have heard the conversation, and from that point on, \\"Chris\\" never returned to our table. \\n\\nTo be fair, the food was still quality and the second server was a lot better. I was appreciative that Chris never returned to our table - he seemed extremely unhappy and took it out on people around him in an unprofessional way. \\n\\nIt is unfortunate what could have been a wonderful dining-social experience was ruined by other diners and a rude server. Perhaps the management can benefit from enforcing better conduct policies in the resto and also screening their servers for a higher standard of professionalism. For this reason, we will not likely return to this resto."},{"name":"The Original Szechuan Chongqing Seafood Restaurant","address":"1668 W Broadway, Unit 205","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Fine if you like American/Canadian Chinese food.\\n\\nWe went here on a Groupon.

They were gracious despite our two strikes (1. groupon, 2. friend's baby).  They do standard Indian dishes like Navrattan Korma and Shahi Paneer very well and their lamb is halal.  Bukhara has a pretty large and varied menu, including standard North Indian fare, dosas, and creative dishes like coconut lamb curry.  \\n\\nThat being said, the coconut lamb curry was not very well executed.  It was literally  mildly charred lamb CHOPS (complete with bone) in coconut curry sauce.  Creative, yes, but would have been better with boneless chunks of lamb.  \\n\\nNot bad overall. I would probably go back, but will definitely not use Applemaps.  Ever. Again."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I've been here a few times and recently had a lovely dinner here with friends. Their alcoholic beverages are creative and delicious. We had three entrees ranging from lamb, chicken, to salmon and they were quite flavorful and authentic. I do wish that the entrees were accompanied by more than the protein but you can optionally add veggies, rice, plantains, etc. on as a side. They don't take reservations and tend to get busy quickly so suggest arriving early if possible."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Long wait if you don't have reservation, food was okay and too salty.

The food is yummy and affordable. The girl who runs trivia is pretty cool. All around its a good time. I really like the atmosphere. It's comfy but not homey. It's like the kind of place you actually want to chill out with friends. It's clean and let me tell you that the bathroom's pretty. lol. \\nMy only advice to the crew would be to get their wait staff together and teach them on how to team work. Our table needed servicing and my coke sat empty for a hot minute. mmm. yeah. sounds trivial but we all know a good waiter keeps your cup full."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very disappointing (and last) experience at Flip. Just walked out after being seated and summarily ignored by the staff. When I walked in to have lunch around 12:30, the restaurant was about half full. I asked a hostess/server if I could sit at the bar, and she encouraged me to do so. She didn't bother to grab me a menu or let the bartender know I was there, so I sat there for about ten minutes. No one spoke to me even once. Totally pathetic. This place has gone way downhill since its heyday, and there are SO many places in Atlanta that actually want your money, and I'm spending mine at one of them right now!"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm not a connoisseur of Indian cuisine, but I definitely enjoy it from time to time.  Last week I ordered Clay Pit delivery. Came out to about $30 plus delivery charges for two dishes. To me that's kinda pricey especially because when my food arrived, the portions appeared to be child sized. \\n\\nI tried the chicken vindaloo and the beef coconut curry. Yummy indeed, but just not quite enough for the price being charged. Naan also was an extra $2 and even then only came with 2 pieces. With Indian food I feel you need way more than one piece of naan per person. How else can you enjoy all the creamy sauce that's left behind? \\n\\nI also was a little disappointed because my food was not spicy even though I requested it to be extra spicy. Maybe if I had eaten in the restaurant, I would've been able to convey the spice level I desired.\\n\\nIn the future I think I'll only go to Clay Pit to dine-in and skip delivery."},{"name":"The Breakfast Club","address":"270 Western Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Great diner. Prices are resonable. I had pancakes with sausage on the side. I didn't really pay attention to prices at first & was a little surprised that the side of sausage is $2.99 -- the 3 pancakes were $4.79 which is reasonable.  In any case, the food was tasty & served hot.   I was there on a weekday and got a seat right away at the counter. Service was ok -- actually that's the reason for docking them the final star. The place really was not that busy & had the waitress not spent so much time on the phone I would not have waited so long for refill on my drink. I will definitely go again -- it was a good meal!"},{"name":"Petrone's Pizza","address":"438 Main St","city":"Melrose","stars":"3.5","text":"Buffalo chicken calzone.  By far the best thing that I have had here.  The chicken has a great flavor and the crust is thin and tasty.  I have tried their buffalo chicken appetizer, sub, and salad, and for some reason none of them taste nearly as good as when they are in the calzone.  I have tried their subs and wraps and was not overly impressed--not bad, just nothing special--but their homemade pita is very good.  If you are looking for a sandwich, I would highly recommend getting it on this.  Pizza is decent, but I prefer a thinner crust.  Nothing compares to the buffalo chicken calzone, though--try it, you will not be disappointed."},{"name":"Hall of Fame Pizzeria & Wings","address":"912 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"Hall of Fame Pizza is now closed, and for good reason.
