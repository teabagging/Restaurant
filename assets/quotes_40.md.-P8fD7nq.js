Another time I ordered half turkey sandwich with a cup of soup, I was brought chicken schnitzel.  I sat and waited another 10 min for my order to arrive and it was pathetic for the price charged, I would guess MAYBE 2 oz of turkey on big puffy bread, I am sure the soup was also under a 'Cup' as far as portions go.  Had dinner recently with family from out of town and they hadn't been there for years, the first thing they said was 'what happened to this place?  The food has no flavor and very small portions for a one course meal at the price charged' One of us had the chicken schnitzel and the meat was pounded thinner than the batter which made the meat tough as rubber, couldn't cut it with a knife.  The order of sauerbraten was okay but not very tender, lacked flavor and the lentil soup?  Wow, brown liquid, had to add quite of bit of salt and pepper to even taste anything.  Used to love this place but after several visits I am going to have to write it off as the quality has gone downhill over the last few years.

The best thing about this place is the beautiful, huge patio which winds all around the west side of the building to the back, which is the nicest, coolest area....except for the hoards of flies that attack the minute you sit down.  This is always a risk with patio dining but 50 flies on your table is just gross and other restaurants manage this problem effectively.  We ate our mediocre bland tacos as fast as we could whilst swatting all the flies, then got the heck out of there.

It was a little disconcerting to have bottled water instead of water and ice on tap but witnessing the rather not so pleasant water in the area was glad to have bottled after all.  The shared mint tea was delicious.  One of our party had ordered the chicken Briwat and was so taken with the sweet/savory egg roll we ordered a second and third order to share.  We were totally shocked to see a sweet drizzling confection over a chicken egg roll; it arrived piping hot, crunchy and totally delicious.

In each there are several options, and our server told us about a few specials that sounded equally exciting. My friend and I settled on the Tempura Vegetables (asparagus, red peppers, bok choy, red onions) with sweet and spicy dipping sauce; Korean BBQ-style marinated pork skewers; and Tuna Guacamole. The latter was probably the most exciting for me, as it featured the inimitable raw tuna mixed in with mashed avocado and onions, served with plantain tostones as chips. My only complaint was that it could have used a little seasoning, but it didn't stop me from eating it all.\\n\\nThe service was fast and friendly, and the prices quite reasonable. A dish from each column and a pitcher of premium beer for $36 pre-tip. I'll definitely be back.\\n\\nEdit, 12/7/2007: Since this is review of the day, I feel it's appropriate that I update it.

Just because you've traveled all over the states doesn't entitled you to a more defined palate than what is already here. Blame it on your sub par palate. And this is an upscale sushi... why the hell would they allow take out just for you? Seriously, it's hilarious and annoying. They are entitled to keeping the integrity of their business the way they see fit. If you want sushi take out, hit Publix - it's already boxed up for you too.\\n\\nNo restaurants are perfect or perfectly capable of catering to everyone's rambunctious needs. Their waiting time was much longer than I anticipated but it's a hot new dining place, make yourself aware of that so that it doesn't impact your rating capabilities. \\n\\nOn a lighter note, I had an impeccable time dining here. We had a 10pm reservation but we didn't get to sit until 10:30ish. We hung out at the bar and they were fully aware that we were having a long wait... so we had a complimentary edamame while we had our two round of drinks. I had the Mojito and it was refreshing. The second drink was just Ameretto and orange juice... trying to pace ourselves... \\n\\nWe lucked out and got seated at the bar so from now on, if i'm not in a big group, I would always ask to be at the bar... even if I had to change my date... it would be bar. Reasoning, there's so much more happening at the sushi bar than at the tables. You can see Chef Ito in action delicately slicing my otoro (fatty tuna)... it was such an experience on its own. \\n\\nWe ordered the following: Kobe Beef Roll, Lobster Roll, Scallops, Chilean Sea Bass and of course their infamous Green Tea Souffle. I also ordered my Ortoro topped with a slice of jalapeno and caviar. It was my birthday, we don't hold back. I felt spoiled that I can eat all this and it was worth it. \\n\\nThe Kobe Beef roll melts in my mouth...I love the red pepper threads and the fried garlic garnish on each roll. Worth the $35 for a roll of 8. The lobster roll was good but it wasn't amazing like the Kobe Beef since it's so ordinary. \\n\\nThen came this adorable little flaming pot which was cooking our Scallops. Now, my girlfriend and I never go out of our way to order scallops... it just doesn't fancy our ridiculous palate but we made an exception. It was a good exception because the scallops were fresh and delicious. \\n\\nChilean Sea Bass was our last entree and my life felt complete after my first bite. It was just so perfect, nicely seasoned and melts in your mouth. To compliment this and the scallops... would be a bowl of steaming white rice. \\n\\nSo in between orders, I also had my nigiris...Ortoro (fatty tuna) with Caviar, Kobe Beef and Tuna... it was pretty damn amazing. It was fresh, it was the right amount of everything that should be on it in one bite. \\n\\nLastly... the Green Tea Souffle... I remembered one reviewer mentioned that we should order that in advance since it takes about 20 min. to come so we did that. This portion was perfect to share since we had plenty to eat already. The waiter brought out this pretty and broke the souffle to pour their green tea anglaise in the center. This is what makes it so gooey and yummy in the center. The souffle has the perfect crunch on the outside and creamy on the inside. Not too heavy and perfect dessert to end the night. \\n\\nChef Itro introduced his lovely wife, who is the pastry chef behind the souffle and walked us out.

It came open faced, cooked to order at medium-rare (I don't know how they cook it but they manage to keep the meat very evenly done, which is a plus) with a sauce that had a peppery and subtle blue cheese flavour. Lots of garlic-packed gravy between the steak and the bread. As an example of what the kitchen at the Fairmont can do, I'm impressed. \\n\\nNote: this being the Fairmont... it was expensive. Hovering near or slightly above twenty dollars for sandwich and side salad.

I went in here after a game on a Fri night and left my favorite Blazer hat (It had a lot of sentimental value because my friend who passed gave it to me). I realized that I had left it there a couple days later and called to see if they had it. I was thrilled to hear they did and went in as soon as I could, which was the next day. When I got there, there were two \\"hipster dudes\\" who half ass pretended to look for maybe 5min before telling me, with NO apology, that the owner either \\"gave it away or threw it away.\\" I said I would call back in the morning (when someone would actually try looking). Much to my disappointment, the person who answered the next morning also didn't try and just said they'd call me back if they found it and hung up before I could give my info. Unsurprisingly, I never received a call back. I called back again, and this time the manager answered. This time, I was hopeful because she actually sounded like she cared- She took down my info, said she would send out a group text to see if anyone had seen it, and would call me back the next day regardless. Unfortunately, I never received that call back.. AGAIN. So I called a third time two days later, and whoever answered the phone got agitated with me, as if I was inconveniencing them to expect to receive my hat back.. However, I did finally receive a call back only to hear they never found it.. I do not expect people to keep track of my lost items, but if YOU SAY YOU HAVE A CUSTOMERS ITEMS, IT BETTER BE THERE. I don't mind replacing my lost items, but this hat has a lot of sentimental value and is irreplaceable. No one threw it away, and I've worked in the service industry for yrs- It's against policy to give things away in 4 days. What really happened was an employee took it, and no one wanted to confess. But what upsets me most was the lack of care. I had to call 3 times before getting a real response, I wasn't shown any sympathy or understanding, and I barely got a half ass apology let alone offered a credit in return (not that I'd ever go back to support this establishment), even after THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY LOST IT DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION AMONG THEIR OWN STAFF.

It was obvious that she was busy and a little frazzled but quickly brought us our menu and utensils. \\nI asked if they had soy milk and could make lattes out of it. She said yes so I ordered a matcha green tea latte. She brought out a normal soy latte and said that the matcha latte was coming soon. I explained how I didn't want two drinks and just wanted the matcha soy latte. She then became irritated at me for ordering wrong (when I ordered correctly but she misheard). She then said they had used the last of the soy milk on the drink they had just incorrectly made and tried to convince me that it would be okay if I drank the matcha latte because they used so little milk in it. I have light lactose intolerance and I can have a little milk, but it was irritating that she tried to convince me to drink something I didn't want to. It would be similar to telling a vegetarian they could have some meat and it would be okay.I ended up getting the matcha latte with normal milk and it was actually pretty bad. I would not recommend it. \\n\\nAfter the drink fiasco, I was really looking forward to my waffle. When the food finally came, they brought me strawberry pancakes instead. I was supremely irritated now because they messed up literally everything I had ordered. I ended up just eating the pancakes because I was so hungry and by this point I really just wanted to leave. The food wasn't even spectacular! I didn't think the pancakes were anything more special than what I could have gotten at IHOP. I would not go back for them. The person at the the table next to me got the avocado toast and that actually looked delicious.

This is the plus of going a little bit outside the perimeter - this place is probably 3 miles east of 285 - and the value of the food was great. Gyros and wraps were only $5! I was in the mood for chicken, dolmades and a salad and when the initial cost came to $12, the helpful employee said she wanted to figure out a way so that I could save some money.

So good, I would consider becoming his firstborn's Godmother. So good,  I would help him move apartments. So good, I would... well, you get the point.\\n\\nUpon seating us after a grueling horseback trek utilizing muscles-that-were-completely-unprepared-for-gripping-a-saddle-whilst-breaking-into-a-trot-through-a-rocky-path-uphill-both-ways, Brian recommended a mystery stout from Independence Brewery. 'Stout? Bugh. I hate stouts.' So my partner ordered the stout and I stuck by trusty 512 Pale Ale. Still a little delirious from trotting fatigue, I couldn't answer Brian when he asked what appetizer I'd like.\\n\\nBrian: What appetizers would you like to start with today?\\nMe: ....\\n...\\nMe: uh...\\n...\\nMe: er.... \\n...\\nMe: I...\\nBrian: Need some time?\\nMe: God yes.\\n\\nOnce my gluteus maximus settles into a seat that is cushy and very much not hard leather, my brain follows suit. Scanning the appetizers, I see it. Like a hunting retriever, I'm certain I froze, pointing with my snout to the Barbacoa Stackers. After explaining to my partner what the 'coa is, why it is my measuring stick for credible interior Mexican food, and why I could not tear my eyes away from it, I tell Brian and he brings a platter with three tostadas, black beans, cabbage, carrots, a bit of melty queso fresco and the perfect amount of barbacoa. The first bite, and we can't stop laughing. Maybe that's because I got up at 6a that morning to squeeze in a jog before horseback riding, or maybe my body had taken over my mental capacity for thinking rationally, but we were at a loss for ways to verbally express our nirvana.\\n\\nMe: Ohh...... shit.\\nPartner: Oh... my.... [inaudible noise]\\nMe: In your mouth. Put it in your mouth.\\n\\nAfter spewing a slew of nonsense, we could not stop laughing at how inadequate a fork was for shoveling this divinity to our lips, and how gleeful this made me. How often does an APPETIZER crown an entire day for you, hm? Something came over me when I tasted that dish, and now I can't stop thinking about it. Mystery Stout was mysterious because it was a trial brew from Austin's own Independence Brewery. There were only a handful of cases they gave Jack Allen's to try out on their patrons. Unfortunately, this bottle was the sole survivor of their last case. Say what? Yes. We share the bottle, but leave a few ounces after the suggestion of Wonderful Brian, for a mini beer float with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. That is just dirty. Like 29-year-old Trent Reznor bonded & blindfolded dirty.\\n\\nPartner's crispy salmon, crab, firm hothouse tomato wedges (knife and fork sliceable), and roasted tomatillo sauce amalgamation had more than one 'perfect bite' that chefs intend for you to come across. My portobello mushroom, garlic-buttery zucchini, melty swiss, tomatoes and Russian dressing 'burger' was equally fantastic, but difficult to focus on when there was one remaining Barbacoa Stacker staring at me. \\n\\nLeaving the restaurant, 'SO glad you missed that exit for Southwest Parkway.'

We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night and were seated immediately, in a beautiful small dining room with lace curtains and white tablecloths.  The ambiance is that you are dining in a small tratorria in Italy.  On top of that, an elderly accordian player was playing familiar movie themes live and we found ourselves singing along.  There were maybe twelve tables filled with patrons who seemed to be regulars, and it was not five minutes before one of the owners came to our table and introduced himself and told me the story of how he and his partner came to Smyrna 20 years ago and set up this delightful restaurant.  The food arrived quickly and was hot and delicious--I always judge an Italian restaurant the first time by the lasagna, which I ordered, and this was different.  There was hardly any meat sauce or ricotta inside--just stacks and stacks of freshly made pasta and some cheese, then covered in meat sauce and so much fresh ground Parmesan that I didnt even ask for extra--it was already there!   It  was wonderful! My wifes chicken Piccata was equally tasty, but we had no room for the delicious looking desserts.

There are a few outdoor tables which look like they would be nice when weather permits. We were seated immediately, and upon my Yelp check-in I was surprised to see a check-in deal for free spring rolls.\\n\\nService was a bit slow to arrive for our drink orders, taking about 10 minutes.  However, the waitress realized this and apologized, and at no point after that did we find her absent so all is forgiven.  She explained the menu nicely, which was helpful since we were a bit confused at first (there's a section called \\"small plates\\" and other sections for noodles, etc, so were the noodles small plates or full entr√©es?) She also suggested an order-as-you-go method, where instead of ordering everything at once, you can just \\"feel it out\\" and order a couple of things at a time until you're full.\\n\\nSo all in all, we ordered:\\n\\nChar kway teo : a noodle dish with shrimp, chicken and sprouts.  It's smaller than an entr√©e normally would be, but a bit bigger than the \\"small plates\\".  We ordered this and split it.\\n\\nSpring rolls : pretty standard vegetarian spring rolls (the fried variety).  They were good but they didn't pop out at something special.  Being free made them taste even better. :)\\n\\nRoasted Duck : Beautifully cooked, fork-tender slices of duck.  Very nice.\\n\\nFive-spice calamari : An interesting version of fried calamari, with a mild sweetness to it and an interesting flavor. Better than your average fried calamari.\\n\\nBanh mi bulgogi sliders : Three Korean bulgogi sliders with the standard banh mi ingredients (carrot, cucumber, cilantro, mayo) on delicious, crunchy baguette sections.  We loved them enough that we had to get a knife to split the third piece because neither of us wanted to give it up (being a gentleman, I offered the last third to her, but she could tell I wanted it).\\n\\nRoti Canai : A delicious (though a bit oily) bread served with a curry-ish sauce for dipping.  We got this with an extra roti which turned out to be a good idea because there was more than enough sauce for two pieces.\\n\\nBy the time we were done, we were full and happy.  It was a great experience, and while it may have been a bit of an expensive lunch at $35 when all was said and done, it was probably about as much as visiting a decent sushi restaurant.

And  I was looking for a little bite from the sauce, a little drift of fennel from the sausage, some interesting flavors from the cheese, but no... it just seemed bland.  Flavor-wise, we're pretty big fans of Pieology as well as Mod, despite all the nags on both of them.

I must admit the baked mac and cheese I make is better than theirs...kudos for my baked mac and cheese...suggestion, more real chedder!  Also, I don't like cabbage and you have to be quick to tell them you don't want or it will end up on your to go plate, becasue they have a tendancy to not ask you if you want it before they throw it on there.

It wasn't spectacular, but it was ample, filling, consistent and tasty, and on the occasions I ordered from the a la carte menu I found their offerings thoroughly decent---again, not spectacular, but fresh and flavorful and excellent value for the money. A real asset to the local dining scene.\\n\\nWhat the Hell happened?\\nI'm giving a star for service. It was fast and accurate,( aside from the fact that we asked for tea and never got it)  and had just the right level of brusqueness for a Chinese place, but, Oh My God, you call that food?\\n\\nThe hot and sour soup first course was just OK, but the portion has shrunk dramatically since days of yore. Also, the hot part of hot and sour? Not so much. You used to be able to season your food from bottles of hot sauce and vinegar on the table. Not any more.  Kung Pao beef, despite the flowery description in the menu promising a rainbow of flavors from myriad seasonings, tasted of nothing but salt. The beef was grainy and tough with no perceptible beef flavor, the sauce was brown glue, and the whole sorry mess sat in a shocking puddle of oil. I requested it extra spicy, but there was no spice whatsoever, despite huge amounts of sichuan chilis, suggesting said chilis have been sitting around in an open container for longer than they should have been. The accompanying small bowl of rice was just a damp wodge of nothing much and arrived at the table one step away from cold and already forming a skin. Note to kitchen: Some do-ahead jobs are just going to piss people off.\\n\\nMy companion's dish was simply bizarre. The 'rice cakes' were discs of rubber in an immense heap, interspersed with  the odd clot of egg and something that might have been lettuce. It was impossible to make much headway with this unseasoned starchy mountain.

Prior to visiting their pub in Bend many years ago I thought they were merely good.  Then I sampled some of the special brews served on tap there and was convinced of their greatness.  Obsidian stout has long been one of my favorites.  It's good in a bottle, but on a nitro tap?  It's rich, creamy, bitter bliss.  Their cask-conditioned bitter is just like I remember at pubs in Britain.  There are always a number of unique brews on tap (and unavailable elsewhere) that showcase the Northwest's bountiful hop harvest and their brewmaster's skill.  I've been back to their Bend pub many times over the years and was so glad when they opened the Portland location.  Sure, Bend is... nice.  Portland is a helluva lot more fun.  And closer to Seattle.\\n\\nI've been to the Deschutes Brewery and Public House in Portland twice now and the beer and food is every bit as good as I recall it was in Bend.  On both occasions we had to wait to be seated, which is probably to be expected on a Friday or Saturday night.  However, once you check in they'll hand you a big \\"coaster\\" which will flash and notify you when your table is ready.  Head to the bar for a drink or take a stroll around the neighborhood--the range on the coaster is about a block.  Pick up one of their menus that explains all the brews and start planning out which ones you want to try.  If you're new to Deschutes you might want to get one of their samplers.  In general I recommend steering away from their standard brews that you can get in bottles at the grocery store.  They're good, but the reason to come here are for the rotating selections you can't get anywhere else.  One caveat though: it's worth trying whatever they have on nitro or cask, as it makes even their standard brews shine.\\n\\nOn this most recent visit my fellow yelper Kathleen and I scored a table at the bar.  Since we were starving after hiking Mt. Hood, we decided to order our food there and not wait to be seated in the restaurant.  As soon as we sat down a server came over to greet us and take our drink order.  I started off with the pilsner (#005), which was crisp, refreshing and delicious.  Kathleen had the Cascade ale, which is another good choice if you prefer a lighter beer.  Sadly as a diabetic I can't really do the nitro Obsidian anymore, so for my second beer I tried the Hop Trip.  This is a special brew made with a truckload of fresh local hops and is quite a treat for fans of this bitter flower.  For dinner I had a delicious burger with bacon and creamy, tangy Oregon blue cheese.  It came with a side of hot, crispy, golden fries.  My friend chose the elk burger with a side salad, which she seemed to enjoy very much.  I've had it previously and thought it was fantastic. It comes with roasted shallot & thyme aioli and gruyere, is very tender and has a wonderful flavor (kinda like cow, but subtly different).\\n\\nSadly the Deschutes Brewery and Public House is so popular it can seem like a zoo sometimes.  However, I've always found the service to be excellent and the experience is worth the wait.  The food is top-quality and a cut above the average pub grub.  But the beer? It's worth a three hour pilgrimage from Seattle.  This place is Mecca for beer."},{"name":"Everett House of Pizza","address":"722 Broadway","city":"Everett","stars":"2","text":"Rude phone manners!

I have to admit that I'm kind of blown away by how tasty these burger are.  I didn't expect this from a strip mall type location, but Austin seems to have some real jems locked away inside of strip malls.  Now I should also mention that I've only had one type of burger from them so far.  The mushroom and Swiss, but I've had it twice in three days so I think that counts for something.  The burgers come in a regular and large size.  I (being a big eater/person) like the large and find it a good sized burger.  They are moist and seasoned well, the buns are fantastic too.  I just ate the last one about two hours ago and could go for another right now.  I'm not as big a fan of their fries.  I don't think that's their fault at all, I'm just not a big fan of the shoe string cut fry.  I do really like that they have a number of fry options.

A friend got the wedge salad while I was having my first burger, she said it was good.  I personally can't get excited about a wedge salad.  If I want to eat half a head of iceberg lettuce I'll probably just do it at home and save the trip.  I also noticed someone getting one of their shakes while I was in line and it looked fantastic.

Thankfully, on a recent visit to Portland, my Portlander sister's knowledge of cool local hangouts vastly outpaced mine. \\n\\nThe ambiance here is really fun - rowdy, bright, eclectic, with Columbia Sportswear-wearing patrons filling every seat. My sister had made a reservation, and it was definitely much-needed. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, our server was more than happy to act as a beer sommelier for our party. I was in the mood for something tangy and fruity (like a lambic). While Deschutes doesn't make lambics, impressively, the server was familiar with lambics -- and told me that only Belgian monks can make them. Instead, he suggested The Dissident - an \\"oud bruin\\" (Flemish for \\"old brown\\") made with wild yeast. (http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/brew/dissident). It was complex, intriguingly sour, and very drinkable. \\n\\nEveryone enjoyed their food, although the prices were a little high. I ordered the crab roll, which consisted of a small scoop of crab salad piled on top of - not filling the inside of - a tiny, whole bun of brioche. (I'd expected a sandwich). It was tasty, as was the accompanying fish soup, but the portion was a little small for the $17 price. \\n\\nIn contrast, everyone else's portions were positively gargantuan. My sister had the mac and cheese (a truly massive bowl, and delicious); and two others had the chicken and waffles, which were also generous portions and looked delicious. \\n\\nIf I lived in Portland, I can see Deschutes Brewery becoming one of my favorite after-work or weekend haunts."},{"name":"Capo Restaurant","address":"443 West Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Phenomenal restaurant experience!

You know when chickeken get so over cooked and dried out it turns to an amlost plastic consistency? Yeah. No amount of sauce was gonna help that out.  It would have also been nice to have some noticable chunks of blue cheese in their home made blue cheese dipping sauce. It was the consistency of water with the tase of blue cheese, but you never know it  was blue cheese by looking at it. If you are serving wings, everyone like  blue cheese bits in their dipping sauce, \\n\\nMy friend like her Pecan Gorgonzola Salad. Not being a big beef eater, if she has the option, she  usually will add shrimp or salmon to  her salads.  But here, she went with the  chicken option here because for some reason its $3.95 to add chicken and $7.99 to add shrimp on an already $9. salad.  They did giver her two breasts worth of grilled chicken and she did enjoy the salad, but  we still couldnt find the justification of $8 to add shrimp to a salad., other than its Winchester.\\nOur waitress was a bit frazzled and inconsistant. We sat down and she came right over and asked if we wanted anything to drink and if we were ready to order, my friend asked for a an ice tea and a minute more to decide. I asked for a soda water.  She brought the ice tea right over and said she would be right back with mine. Literally 10 minutes later ( you know when you start looking for your waitress, not because you are in a hurry, but you think that she had forgotten about you)  she comes back with my drink and  my friend and I order. My friend orginally asked for the Jumbo shirmp but she was told that they were out of them, and if she  knew what she wanted faster she might have gotten them. No, how about if you didn't make us sit here for 10 minutes she may have gotten them.\\nI also agree with another reviewer, at $2.50 a soda in glasses that aren't the  large bar tumblers, the least you can do if offer a free refill. Two soad waters for $5 is a bit much.\\n\\nOver all it was just ok. Nothing to write home about, nothing special and nothing to warrant a special trip to Winchester. If you are a local, its a  fine and a clean place to sit and get a drink. (FINALLY)\\n We will give it one more try at some point in another month or two see if things  get tweeked a bit.

The pizzamakers seemingly don't put any care into how they top the pizza. In our most recent half and half order, there were 'bald spots' between the two sides (resulting in two unwanted slices), the prosciutto has become far and few between (unlike my very first order), and one half was bigger than the other.

But as soon as you walk through the doors, you're transported to another time. The d√©cor is lovely (typical 50's pastel palette) with red barstools and cozy booths. The best part? They have GLUTEN FREE donuts! If you're GF, you know how rare this is. There was one left. It was coconut and it was incredible. The waitress (I wish I remembered her name) was one of the best I had...she offered to warm up our donuts and provided some great recommendations. Their pastrami hash is reallyyyyy good. Please go here!"},{"name":"Waxy O'Connor's","address":"94 Hartwell Ave","city":"Lexington","stars":"3","text":"I've come here the last several years while in town for business and get-togethers with friends, but probably no more. Sad to say, because there are some highlights like the clam chowder and service overall. But the food quality isn't quite up to the prices charged. And neither was a lukewarm, 3/4 filled Martini worth even half of the $14 charged. I used to enjoy the atmosphere but the last time, the noise level got to us. Even when the singer was taking a break, the music on the house system made conversation difficult. Sorry, I'll have to find a new go-to place."},{"name":"Lee's Golden Buddha","address":"2524 Cobb Pkwy SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"An oldie, but a goodie.  Lee's Golden Buddha 7 is my guilty pleasure for Americanized Chinese food.  There are other Lee's Golden Buddha restaurants in metro Atlanta, but this one is my favorite.  They serve not only Chinese cuisine, but also Malaysian, Thai, and Korean dishes too.  Their Chinese food is surprisingly good and sometimes quite addicting.  Maybe it's all the MSG they use.*\\n\\nThe restaurant's design goes back to the traditional Chinese restaurant style of the 80s and 90s.  There are ornate carvings of dragons in between booths and on the backs of the dark wooden chairs.  There's a golden Buddha and a model ship made of jade at the entrance, a fountain, artwork of golden horses on the walls, and the ceiling has beautifully enameled, hand-carved, boxed Chinese artwork and lighting.  There are booths, tables with and without lazy Susans, and a private dining area.  There's a small bar with TV too.  This place isn't upscale or trendy by any means, but it's nicer than your average casual Chinese joint.  Due to its age, it is a bit worn.\\n\\nThe menu looks like typical American Chinese takeout with additional dishes.  I'm sure a lot of folks come here to grab egg drop soup, egg rolls, and Kung Pao chicken, but this restaurant offers more than that.  Examples include Laksa (a popular Malaysian/Singaporean noodle soup), Cha Chiang Mein (Northern Chinese noodles), curries and Thai noodles such as Pad Thai and Pad See U, and Rendang (Indonesian spicy beef).  Expect to spend about $9 to $13 per entree at dinnertime.\\n\\nMy favorites include:\\nBeef with Scallops - beef and scallops sauteed with vegetables\\nSea Bass with Black Bean Sauce - boneless fish stir-fried with black bean sauce\\nSzechuan Pork - fried slices of pork with Szechuan sauce\\nMu Shu Pork - shredded pork with scrambled eggs, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and other seasonings, served with thin crepes (pancakes)\\n\\nThe portion size here is quite generous, so be prepared to take home leftovers.  Most of the dishes are drenched in copious amounts of sauce.  When it comes to Americanized Chinese cuisine, I'd say that's a bad thing, but Lee's somehow manages to get it right.  Their sauces are rich and sweet, but not overpowering.  You can always ask for more white rice anyway.\\n\\nThe meats are decent quality, always soft and tender.  Their Mu Shu Pork is so good that one time, I ate an entire serving all by myself.  I knew I was eating too much, but I couldn't stop.  It was too good.  I should have saved some for later because that same night, I woke up in bed with what I think was my first case of heartburn!\\n\\nService is excellent.  Older, friendly, and attentive servers.  The food comes out from the kitchen fast.\\n\\nLee's Golden Buddha 7 is located in the same shopping center as Best Buy Cumberland (Cobb Parkway).  In summary, if you're looking for good Americanized Chinese grub in Atlanta, this restaurant is probably your best bet.\\n\\n*I haven't confirmed if they use MSG or not, but based on how the dishes taste, I would be surprised if they didn't."},{"name":"iSpice","address":"451 E Altamonte Dr, Ste FS09","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"So trying any new Indian restaurant is always risky...

My buddy had the chicken cutlets sandwich looked good but I didnt ask. We order the side chips, very good, light and fresh homemade, not thick and had great seasoning. The sweet potatoe hash with brussel sprouts was really good I think I enjoyed them more than my buddy, but something was missing maybe crispy prosciutto?

However, I don't believe it to be the fault of the restaurant, but the bumbling ineptitude of our server. (Be that as it may, I didn't particularly like the food either for how much it cost) Anyway Nicole, darling thing, had all the ditzyness of a stereotypical waitress in an establishment as chic as this, without the waitress part. It took her at least ten minutes from the time we were seated to approach us. Her excuse was \\"I've got three other tables, I'm a little swamped.\\" It then took her ten more minutes to actually bring us our drinks. After finishing my first glass of tea,  it took her another ten minutes to notice, and another five to bring tea. \\n   A side note, (on which I won't pretend to know the details) a woman approached nicole and told her \\"I think you combined my bill with the table next to mine, because I didn't order any of this food.\\" My brother and I exchanged glances and raised eyebrows. Nicole stared at the woman's receipt for a good ten seconds as though it were written in urdu, before exclaiming, \\"Ohhh, I see what I did.\\" The woman seemed fine with the situation, but I'm sure this might not have been the first time nicole has done something like this.\\n   Aside from her snail-like speed, she was also a very forgetful person. We had to ask three times over the course of twenty minutes after being noticed by her to change the channel on the flatscreen over us to a braves game. After she finally took our order and brought our food, there were multiple things wrong with my order. I asked to hold the slaw on my calamari taco, and to hold the bell peppers on my steak taco. Neither of these things were accomplished in the kitchen, so I sent the plate back and asked it to be fixed. The calamari taco was fixed, but the steak taco was not fixed. I didn't want to be the person that sends their food back twice, for fear darling nicole would spit in it, so I just picked off the bell peppers and ate my taco. Mind, I do this because bell peppers upset my stomach, not because I dont like the taste. When nicole saw what I was doing, she chuckled to herself as though she thought I was being childish.\\n   Overall, the food was not worth what we payed for it. The calamari taco was MUCH too sweet, and the steak taco was entirely flavorless. (This explains why they insist on making the taco 20% meat and 80% topping) The queso was alright, but the jalapenos were rubbery.\\n   On another note of forgetfulness, my sister's birthday was mentioned to nicole twice, but she failed to acknowledge it in any way. She asked how old she was, and when told twenty-five, nicole made a confused face. When asked what was the matter, it took her MUCH too long to say \\"You don't look... that old...\\"\\n   Ultimately, I will never eat here again. If I could go back and give my sister another birthday gift, it would be to suggest that she choose another restaurant at which to have dinner. As such, I give you this advice now; save your money and your time, if you want sub-par mexican food at a better price and with better service, you will find a taco bell much to your satisfaction.

If you are coming from downtown, as I was, you might be in a funk over how unattractive this area is. Keep your chin up and your eyes on the prize. For crammed into three long blocks comprised of ugly strip cement malls are hundreds of restaurants, and cafes, some being the finest Asian eateries in Vancouver. Many of these don't post menus on the windows. Maybe they consider it vulgar or maybe the China expats have too much money to care. I had to exit a Vietnamese restaurant because they had no non meat options. Stroll around, and prepared to indulge your stomach. Evenings, you will see groups of young Asians walking around, heading to their choice of eats. Why make dinner, when you have such an amazing selection at reasonable prices to choose from?\\n\\nShanghai Morning was packed when I went in. I was tired after walking for 8 hours and definitely ready to eat. The food here is great. After spying the portions here, I decided to order just one dish, the Braised fish in Wine Sauce. The fish was fresh, and so tender in its delicate wine sauce and paired nicely with the Chinese black fungus, with a slight bitter taste that I thought maybe came from the wine. There was none of that oil you find at the bottom of your plate when you order from many NYC Chinese places. This is Vancouver Chinese, light, properly cooked and well seasoned. There is no excess of salt or grease.  Prices are reasonable, especially given the size of the entrees. The portion as, I expected, would have been enough for two. I devoured it all in its delicious entirety, my only regret that I was so stuffed I could sample anything else there or at any other restaurant that night.\\n\\nService here was perfunctory. They also seemed to speak mostly Chinese and wowed me by understanding my broken Cantonese. Pointing to anything on the menu is an option if  the waitress doesn't understand you. They were packed so they hesitated to give me the sole remaining table that would have seated four, then gave in. Vancouver's Chinese restaurants, I noticed, don't put strangers at your table if you have empty seats, even when packed. They waited politely until I finished every bite of my scrumptious meal, not rushing me out so they could fill the table. Decor won't thrill you, as its not an upscale place but it was no dive and it was clean. Service here isn't the warmest, but they are efficient and professional. Had I been with my friend, we would have ordered more and sampled. The food here is definitely very good and from what I saw and tasted, authentic Chinese."},{"name":"Starlite Diner & Lounge","address":"1750 29th St, Ste 1064","city":"Boulder","stars":"2.5","text":"Went here with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We were all disappointed and extremely annoyed at this place.  First, we had to find a waitress to take our drink order.  It took about 45 minutes for anyone to come take our food order.  Thankfully with the drinks we ordered a couple of starters to enjoy.  The starters, funnels fries and fried pickles, were both tasty.  We did have to ask for the syrup to dip the funnel fries though.  Not a big deal, but it gets worse from there.\\n\\nIt took over an hour to get our food!!  Burgers, etc. should not take over an hour too cook.  Our food came out in waves, so one or two people would get their sandwich and the rest would be sitting there watching them eat.  The birthday person was the LAST one to get her food!!!  Several of us ordered veggie burgers and they charge EXTRA for a veggie burger.  One of the veggie burgers came out with bacon on it!  How ridiculous!  Sweet potatoe tots were ordered instead of fries, but they did not come out.  Basically, they couldn't get things straight and they never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks or bothered to refill water.  \\n\\nWhen we complained about the lack of service and time it took to get our food, they offered a couple dollars off two meals.  That didn't satisfy us.  Eventually they did do more for us with the bill, but we shouldn't have had to keep complaining.  \\n\\nAll in all we were there for almost 3 hours with about 12-15 people and not one of us want to go back.

The place has been very successful that they've established a brick and mortar off of SE Gladstone & SE 38th.\\n\\nI came one evening with my \\"posse\\" to check out SUAE. Unfortunately they had run out of the Meatball sub which I had anticipated to order. I came back again a few nights later, determined to order the darn thing..... and yes it was worth coming back for =)\\n\\n[devour]\\n~~~ [ First Visit ] ~~~\\nPAN FRIED CHICKEN CUTLET ($8.50) - **4 STARS** was breaded well. You can actually order the dish in two ways (both versions are equally popular): \\n(1)  PARM = balsalmic greens, red gravy, provolone & asiago cheese  \\n(2) OLD STYLE = kale,bitter rappini, roasted red bells, provolone & asiago cheese\\n\\nI had ordered the dish PARM style. The Draper Valley chicken was moist! It was breaded & pan fried to juicy perfection. The marinara-like \\"red gravy\\" sauce and melted cheeses definitely did do the sammie justice. This is definitely worth ordering if you're not looking for something as gut-busting as the Broad St. Bomber. The sammie is sliced in half so it's great to share! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shut-up-and-eat-portland#GGomq9mOEI8P7JlXSzt-rQ)\\n\\nBROAD ST. BOMBER ($9) - **5 STARS** was probably the richest item on the menu that we had ordered. Consider it like a \\"Philly Cheesesteak\\". It's definitely filling for one person! You may only want to consume half (unless you want food coma). Here you've got 1/2 lb thin sliced meat, fried onions, cheddar, provolone and choice of hot or sweet peppers. I chose to have sweet peppers and it was exceptional. Flavors were savory, cheesy, and had that definite \\"YUM\\" factor going on. ****CAUTION*** This sammie has a mess factor so beware of some grease spillage running down the palm of your hand! This sammie is also sliced in half for you to easily share!

The sammie consists of 4 pan fried, beef, veal & pork meatballs w/ house made red gravy, provolone, asiago & parmesan. This is a recipe for FOODGASMS. The marinara sauce that comes on the side definitely completes the meal! Meatballs + cheese + carbs = utter amazement on your tastebuds! The meatballs are definitely homemade. None of that frozen junk. The melted cheese definitely adds some \\"oomph\\". If you can't decide what to order here, I think this is a \\"no brainer\\" winner! \\n\\n1.

But I wouldn't share this one =X\\n\\nHOUSE MADE POTATO CHIPS ($2) - **4 STARS** are very WELL made! Just the right amount of saltiness and seasoning to make you want more! Lots of \\"crunch\\" going on. It's definitely worth ordering if you'd like something to complement your sammie. \\n\\nFYI \\n*Meatball subs can run out! Get 'em early!!!

The two things that are consistent is bad service, and decent food. Today was an excellent example of that.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I went to lunch and after sitting at our booth for almost 15 minutes without service, finally placed our order for a cobb salad to split, dressing on the side; fries, and two drinks. Right after my drink came my clumsy ass knocked it over, spilling it all over my phone and wallet. The bus boy was quick to respond with a towel, but I had to ask for extra napkins as ours had been used in an attempt to clean up the mess. Our waitress came to help briefly, but never offered to get me another. That was the last time I would ever see my iced tea as she never offered, nor brought a replacement.\\n\\nOkay, so shit happens, I wouldn't leave a bad review for that. But...\\n\\nWhen our salad came out it was brought in one giant bowl, placed on our table by someone that wasn't our waitress and left that way. We had no silverware, no extra bowl, and no dressing on the side. About 5 minutes later after asking I received my bowl and side of dressing. The bowl was filthy, I mean literally as if it hadn't been washed. There were little flakes of salad and carrots still stuck to it. Really gross. I asked for another bowl. Now, 30+ mins into the experience we were finally ready to eat. We poured the dressing on and started to split up our own salad (in the past the kitchen did this for us at this location); well, to our surprise, the salad already had dressing on it! So now we've got a salad soaked in dressing. Apparently it was tossed with dressing, but the toppings covered up that fact.\\n\\nAaanyway, the chicken on the salad was cold, dry and tough. The rest was good (the fries were great).\\n\\nThe service, however, continued to be terrible. We were never checked on, our waters remained empty nearly the entire lunch, and not only was my GF's drink never refilled, mine never reappeared. I was, however, still charged for it.\\n\\nAfter 10 visits here with continually poor service and mediocre food, I think this time was the last...there are so many great restaurants in this area there is really no reason to patronize and establishment like this. The staff definitely needs work... I'll check in one last time in a few months and see if any changes have been made, but this seems to be a consistent issue at The Original."},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"This was my first trip to Shiki.

But service-wise, I'd prefer to give it a 1.  So I'm giving it a 3 as a compromise.  I would have to agree with another reviewer, Julian G., that the service was rude if not racist.  Went here for lunch with a friend - he's Chinese and I'm Vietnamese.  It was pretty crowded for a Sunday afternoon so we opted to take 2 seats that were open at the bar.  My friend assumed they had the same menu for lunch as they do for dinner so he started to order his usual favorites.  The waitress then informed him that they didn't have those items available for lunch.  When it became apparent that we were considering leaving to find another place, she changed her mind and said it was fine and they could make it for us.  We thanked her, she took our menus, and aside from her bringing over the food, we never saw her face again. She never stopped in to check on us, she never cleared our plates away, and our water glasses remained empty.  Mind you, this place is TINY and we were sitting directly next to where the kitchen was and where she was constantly walking back and forth.  We had to literally flag her down to clear our plates and then again to get the check.  Not wanting to wait another minute, my friend took it upon himself to get up out of his seat and hand her our payment.  My friend actually made a comment that he thought she may be racist against non-Japanese customers because occupying the two seats next to us was a young Japanese couple whose asses were getting some serious kissing.  She never once cracked a smile at us and here she was checking in on them, smiling, and speaking Japanese to them.  It's a shame that I felt so uncomfortable in this restaurant; otherwise, I'd be looking forward to coming here again. This is Brookline - you're going to have non-Japanese customers. If you don't want to lose potential business, you probably should re-consider how you are treating them.

After a night of drinking and dancing and just plain debauchery everyones favorite stop is to this little pizza joint on Orange Ave. Standing in line for what can seem like an eternity, especially when its wrapped around out the door, is an adventure in itself. Don't be surprised to make new friends or invoke new enemies. This is what happens at 2am when a bunch of drunk hungry people are cramped together waiting for that gigantic peperoni slice they feel may never come. If you are really lucky you'll score a knot, Gino's signature rolls which sometimes, but very seldomly, accompany your slice. Now you may wonder is this pizza actually good or just good when you're drunk. The answer to that varies depending on who you ask, but from my stand point of having had it cold for breakfest, after splurging and buying a whole pie one night, Gino's is delicious anytime. And for the record you wouldn't believe the offers we were getting for a slice when we walked out past the accumulating line with that monstrosity. No, the slices aren't as big as the ones you'll find in Adams Morgan for those who have bared witness to those beasts, but they are pretty huge. And they've got lots of flavors to chose from, the white pizza is scrumptious. And I wouldn't say its cheap, but as my brother stated Gino's has a monopoly on late night slices and more than enough patrons willing to shell it out for one. If you're feeling to wiped out from all those red headed sluts to wander about downtown with your late night snack, or breakfest for the real party hardy types, feel free to head up stairs to their dining area. Even grab a beer if you are so inclined. Though from what I can see most of Gino's clientele need to be cut off by the time they stagger to the entrance of this real late night pizza hot spot."},{"name":"Southern Sweets Bakery","address":"186 Rio Cir","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite sister came back from Decatur with a huge cake from Southern Sweets for my birthday.\\n\\nNot only was it beaufiful, but it was delicious.

The staff is always pleasant and attentive but not intrusive.  The bacon cracker jacks and the deviled eggs never disappoint and are good to share.  The small plates are just right in terms of size especially if sharing some starters as mentioned.  The price point for dinner entrees is a little high, you do get a good amount of food, so it is worth it in my opinion.  Honestly, I am hooked on their burger which is always available even if it isn't on the menu at the time.  Two thin patties, cheddar cheese, grilled onions and  home-made pickles, I've never been disappointed.  The burger comes with herb tossed tater tots which are so many I've never seen anyone finish them but they are delicious. This is my suggestion when bringing people for the first time, which we tend to do often, and anyone who has tried it comes away very happy.  It has become the \\"go-to\\" place for a burger in the neighborhood.\\nAs for their cocktails, I believe they are top-notch.  Stick to what is on the menu as those are tried and true.  They hand craft them one at a time and it is translated nicely.  If you aren't familiar with some of the more classic styles it might be hard to get behind a variation they use here but that isn't their issue, it just means the patron needs more spirits education.  I would recommend sitting at the bar and watching the drinks being made as it lends a new level of appreciation to what you receive.  \\nThe atmosphere is one of the few in town that when packed, you can still have a conversation with your dining companions.  I think part of that may be how the place is built but it never has been too loud like so many places these days.

Deschutes has been looking to open a location in Portland for quit some time and chose the former Jim Stevens Auto Body as their location.  \\n\\nThe interior\\nThe Scottish pub ambiance is the right fit for the pearl, but not too trendy inside creating an inviting place for everyone.  Following the green trend, Deschutes reclaimed lumber from the building including a 29 foot beam that was used to create the bar.  The long bar features plenty of space and 16 taps of Deschutes Beers.  While sitting at the bar take a look into the brewery and see what Cam O\`Connor and the crew are brewing.  There is plenty of tables and booths to sit at, but I am sure with the location next to the Gerding Theater and being located in the Pearl in will fill up fast.  The entrance to the dining room is a carved central Oregon inspired scene with animals and natures connecting the pub back to its roots in central Oregon.\\n\\nThe Food\\nWith a selection of NW inspired cuisine ranging from burgers, salads, pizza and sandwiches patrons will have a selection of fine pub grub.  But what this is the Pearl.  For something a little more gourmet try their Lobster Ravioli, Obsidian Braised Beer or Steak & Fries.  Appetizers range in price from $5 to $13.  Lunch from $9 to $12, & Entrees from $11 to $25.\\n\\nThe Beer (The most important Part)\\nImperial Pint (20 oz) $4.25, Half Pint ($2.50) Pitcher $11.75, Sample Tray of six 4oz tasters $6.00\\nWith 16 taps and an experienced brewer like Cam O'Connor Deschutes will not disappoint.  All of the traditional beers including Mirror Pond Ale & Black Butte Porter will be produced here as well as seasonals and a few experimental brews along the way.\\nFor you Abyss fans they do not have this on tap yet, but I am sure at some point they will offer it in limited quantities.\\n\\nThe Brewhouse\\nThe German Made Brewhouse was purchased from a former brewery in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The capacity of the Brewhouse is 21 Beer Barrels per batch or 4,200 beer barrels per year.  After having a few cold ones on your way to the bathroom take a look into the brewery through their large glass observing window and see for yourself this beautiful piece of German craftsmanship accented with shinny copper. \\nCurrent Beers offered\\nCascade Ale\\nMirror Pond Pale Ale\\nBachelor Bitter\\nInversion IPA\\nBlack Butte Porter\\nObsidian Stout\\nGreen Lakes Organic Ale\\n& a few others\\nSo next week on Friday May 2nd head to Deschutes Breweries grand opening and I will see you there.

The flavors were bold, and thats how Iike it. The goji berry chutney gave a sweetness and freshness to the duck liver. Tuna Mole with Lotus Root Chips. The lotus root chips was a good idea, in theory. But the chips were too thin to hold the tuna and avocado. The tuna did not taste that fresh. Chicken Seoul Good (Korean fried chicken with wild mushroom cream, grated parmesan). The chicken was fried to perfection, and the flavors worked really well together. This was my personal favourite dish so far. Heart Attack Rice (Schmatz fried rice, sous vide egg and chicken crackling).

The tacos were delicious as usual, and the nachos were good, but I'm not sure they were worth the price. They layered the cheese (which they don't skimp on) and toppings which is nice, and also use the same pickled jalapenos and onion that are available for the tacos, and a nice chipotle crema drizzle. They're available with meat or without - we ordered them with meat. The nachos came and looked great, although I didn't see any meat, so I took the tray up to the counter to ask if they maybe gave us the no meat option, and they explained that the meat was mixed in with the beans. It was a microscopic amount of meat.\\n\\nAfter coming here a few times now, I've noticed something. The tacos are much smaller if you order them to go, presumably because of the size of the takeout box they put them in. They're not that big to begin with, so $20 (including tip) for 4 tiny tacos and a pop is too much dough.

The hot chicken sandwich was the winner for us - while not as hot as we would have liked, the flavor was there and nicely balanced with their dill ranch and pickles. Solid bun and having the cheese on the outside of the bun was great because it didn't take away from any of the other flavors or textures. Hot chicken was good but with the chicken pieces being massive, there was a lot of chicken meat that you lost the hot flavor. Pimento cheese popovers were really nice - popovers were a bit heavier than I prefer but still good. The biscuits were buttery and flaky - perfectly sized too because a lot of places make them too big that you fill up on biscuits and can't enjoy your meal. \\n\\nI'd definitely come back for the chicken sandwich (probably sub out the fries but I'm not a big steak fry person)."},{"name":"Mezza Luna","address":"1669 Spring Rd SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4.5","text":"Don't order delivery.

The restaurant wasn't even too busy with people to allow this to be excused. (We had the curry meat balls, which are always good. Absolutely do not recommend the Dimsumballs (sp). They have no flavor, just fried.. plainness is the best way I can describe it. And we also tried the golden wontons which were significantly better.) I've let him know we didn't like it but he did not even offer another appetizer instead. He simply remarked, \\"There's nothing I can do about it.\\" And left. Most of our entree's were given to us by totally different servers as this guy was no where to be found and when he did deliver one, the plate was basically slapped against the table and the food nearly fell off. Not even an apology, he just immediately left. At some point, I had to literally tell him to do his job and to please pick up the dirty plates to reduce the clutter. My boyfriend had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a fork in order to eat his steak udon noodles. We didn't have utensils beside chopsticks (Nor were they offered, mind you.) The main entrees were actually good, but honestly the service is not worth returning for. I should not be asking the staff to do their job.

Both were pretty tasty!  The taro was a bit drier but both were flavorful and had a nice crisp outside.\\n\\nVegetarian & Chicken Bean Curd Skin Roll - My mom loves the chicken rolls and always orders it if it's on the menu. This is pretty good. Very meaty... I preferred the vegetarian one more tho.  Mushrooms and veggies :] NOM!\\n\\nPan Fried Chinese Chive Pie - I think these are my favorite item on their menu.  They're like a giant pan fried dumpling or samosa. A nice thin skin and nice and chivey with thick glass noodles, egg and such.  It's a bit light on the filling but the taste is GREAT!  \\n\\nJulienned Pig Eat Salad in Hot Chili Oil - YUM! This is one of my favorite all time dishes.  Crunchy, chewy AND these were nice and THINLY sliced... I don't like it when restaurants cut them too thick. These were perfection!

Next time I'll just eat these IN the resto.\\n\\nPan Fried Pork Buns & Steamed Pork Buns - Both are great.  The pan fried has that nice crunch from the greasy crust. YUM!  The mantou bun is SOOOOO GOOD and tender, fluffy and a nice chew.  The filling had GREAT flavor but it was just a tiny ball:[ I'm a huge meat eater and need my meat in my buns!

All starch, barely any egg and it was just placed on TOP of oysters and spinach not cooked in it. :T  The sauce seemed like same generic brown sauce they gave with lots of other items :T \\n\\nSticky Rice Ball - They also gave me a free ball of rice, basically oil rice that you'd find in a the leaf wrapped zongzhi.  \\n\\nFive Spiced Beef in Shao Bing - Actually I might like these more than the chive pies.. not sure OMG sooo good.  While the bun could've had more layers of flakey and maybe thicker, the flavors and textures were AMAZING. TONS of fresh scallions [which I LOOOOVE] nice tender beef. OMG.

Then, ironically or unironically, the colleague who had asked for the fried pickles didn't have her actual meal order go through, so 11 of us were served roughly 10 minutes before she got her food, which was awkward (and especially not ideal since we were on a bit of a time crunch).\\n\\nMistakes happen at restaurants, that's not the issue.  It was just the way the server handled it.  She couldn't have possibly appeared less interested in being there, or in helping us.  Maybe she was having an off day, but given that the place was nearly empty and we were going to be a table of 12 leaving a rather significant tip, the grump factor was pretty noticeable to all of us - ironically or unironically."},{"name":"Vinito Ristorante","address":"4971 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"This is the only full-service restaurant in the Prime Outlets.

Four farm-fresh tomatoes with a very generous helping of mozzarella, and a really tasty balsamic glaze. I followed with a bowl of Italian Wedding Soup, which is surprisingly rare in Italian restaurants. It was absolutely delicious. The full bar looks perfectly stocked, although I opted for a Yuengling or two... or three.

The chicken has a really great breading that is very crisp and light. Served with real maple syrup and gravy on the side. My friend got the poutine which was also pretty good.

Third time was okay, but tonight...4th time, I've finally decided I will not ever return.  It is okay...and that's it.  We were celebrating my husband's birthday, so just the two of us.  When I called for a reservation, we were told we could not get in until 9:30.  I called back to inquire if we could sit at the bar if we got there at 5:30 when they opened, which they said was absolutely fine.  Well, we arrived at 6 to a nearly empty restaurant.  Even the waitress in the bar was surprised that we were not able to get a table in the restaurant.  So we sat in the bar. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable on the menu.  Before going to the restaurant, I went on Canoe's website to check out the menu as I am on a strict diet prescribed by my doctor, so I wanted to make sure I could find something that would be acceptable.  To my surprise, they had an offer for $4 off their Springer Mountain chicken through the end of December if you downloaded the Springer Mountain mobile app.  So, I thought, what the heck...go for it.  So I tried to download the mobile app, but there was not able to with the link that Canoe had on their website.  I then went ahead and joined the Springer Mountain website as a member and \\"liked\\" them on facebook...and then called Springer Mountain to inquire about this because it was not quite \\"user friendly\\" and I could not download the app to my phone.  Springer Mountain was closed today, so I left a voicemail and brought my paperwork to Canoe.  When I inquired about this, I was promptly told that I needed a \\"download code\\" which of course I didn't have since the site didn't work.  I told them I was still going to order the meal but just wanted to bring it to their attention that they were offering something on their site through the end of December and that the link didn't work.  The waitress said she would ask the manager, but came back and said the offer was no longer valid.  I still ordered the meal anyway, but just feel like if you are going to offer something on your site, you should stand behind it.  I just feel like every time I have gone there it has been a disappointment.  There are way too many excellent restaurants in Atlanta...so don't waste your time going to Canoe.

I'm pretty sure it's a good sign when some nicely-attired stranger looks at you and says, \\"You're really going to love those cheese grits.\\" There were so many interesting choices that we didn't use the included option of ordering eggs, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy directly from our server.\\n\\nI have no doubt this place is always packed on any given Sunday, and I don't know if they do brunch reservations or not, so I'll just share a couple of tips with you: Eat at the bar, you'll avoid the wait, she'll get her mimosas faster, and it kind of feels like being at Barley Swine in daylight. Use a separate plate and make a colorful presentation of pastries and raspberry butter for her to share with you. If she wants it all for herself, that's a whole different issue and I can't help you there. And for the love of common sense, use the complimentary valet service, tip the dude, and open the car door for her. Seriously, were you waiting for an app to tell you that? I promise it'll pay off for you during that long and leisurely drive back into town."},{"name":"CAVA","address":"515 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It's alright.

We had chosen this restaurant in hopes that we'd find an authentic French treat, but I can tell you if you're looking for real French food you'll be disappointed.

As soon as we sat down I immediately liked the style in here...felt kind of Victorian in a way with the white decor.  We were visited a few times by the owner as he said hi and checked in on us.  The menu took forever to read and decide as there were a lot of options to choose from.  I ordered a veggie omelet with egg whites, hash browns and wheat toast.  First of all, usually when I order egg white omelets, the flavor usually tells me how good the chef really is.  It's very rare for a place to make an egg-white omelet taste similar to a normal omelet but Joy Cafe knocked it out of the park.  It wasn't oily but was bursting with flavor and fresh veggies including sundried tomatoes.  Yum.  The hash browns were nice and crisp, not oily at all.  The bread tasted like bakery bread that came with homemade jam.  To top it off, when we received our order, the plates were mixed up.  The owner apologized profusely and later the waitress came over with 2 containers of baked pastries for us to take home.  WOW so generous!  Then my friend and I split a chocolate cupcake for dessert and the reviews are so true, folks.  These cupcakes will render you speechless for at least a few minutes, so make sure not to order one on your first date.  The chocolate was so soft that it was melting onto my fork.  The cream cheese frosting was so smooth and light...not heavy at all which is a pet peeve of mine.  This must be a best kept secret because at noon on a Sunday we didn't have a wait at all even though my friend made a reservation.

The bartender was kind enough to wrap it for the airport but when I got home and unwrapped it, it smelled fruity. So I  looked inside, it appeared to be used because there was wet froth inside the top of the skull crevices and when I turned it upside down a drip came out. Mind you, I didn't order a drink. Lol. Look, I know it's dark inside there and hard to clean the skull mugs but ewww, I'd be weary to come back and order drinks & eat there! Ask for a new mug if you're a collector & inspect them before you buy them. Sorry, I wanted to love this place.

Heads up the menu changes at least a little almost ever day so no guarantee what I mention here will be on the menu when you go. That being said, the dumplings were amazing, soft and savory with a kick of flavor from the broccoli. I also highly recommend the duck if its on the menu, its slices of duck breast and my gosh I've never had such flavorful and tender duck; the sweet potato was a great pairing. The celeriac is also a great dish and can be made veg on request. All dishes are on the smaller end so a standard person will need about 2-3 dishes to eat well. Sharing is highly recommended as my girlfriend and I shared 5 dishes and were quite satisfied. Lots of vegetarian options as well as meat too. \\n\\nThe Service: Not gonna lie, I'm having trouble thinking of a time I've had better service than what I experiences here. Big shout out to TJ on this one! He was such a great guy, very knowledgeable of all the dishes and wines, made great conversation, took great care of us and it was as if we'd been friends for ages. He even got us a small notebook from Staplehouse that had out anniversary date stamped on to it, a small gesture but it meant a lot and was much appreciated. The same quality of service I'm sure could be said for everyone there. \\n\\nThe Rest: Reservations are hard to come by so be on the lookout and pounce on reservations the minute they become available. The whole month of January was booked out within a few hours of it opening in December. They have a good wine list with plenty of variety and the bar is well stocked, didn't have any cocktails but all the drinks looked great and seemed to be made with great care. Only thing is I'd probably ask for a more extensive scotch and whisky list -  they were kind of limited but it's aright. Additionally, its a small location, nothing too big, they probably seat about 40- 50 people at a time.

The waitress knew exactly what she was talking about it was great to have a knowledgeable waitress! I had the black cherry margarita which was wonderful the people I were with had a martini  and a draft beer which they both said was lovely. The pimento cheese was pretty good but to be honest I'm not a huge pimento cheese kind of person. I ordered the pork and chorizo medallions with Mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes which the waitress suggested they were great! My companions ordered the fried pork chop and the other ordered the chicken Mac and cheese. Overall the food was pretty darn good!! Then we couldn't skip dessert of course so my friend ordered the blondie brownie topped with ice cream which was sooooooooooooo good (of course I had a bite). I ordered the red velvet Oreo cheesecake to go and it was not good at all sadly. It was the only thing there that was below average!

Not Tom Yum peanut sauce good.. but good enough. \\n\\nThe place isn't much for atmosphere. A few booths and some tables lined up lunch room style.

I didn't know what to expect but it was really flavorful and unique and I will definitely be back for it. Sunday brunch is extremely popular so come ready for a few hours wait. The good part of the wait is that you can still get drinks and enjoy the atmosphere while you wait to get seated for food. To minimize wait time try heading over around 2/3 PM towards the end of their brunch slot for closer to an hour long wait. Fun fact they do serve manmosas during the week for a slightly higher price of $20 versus $15 at brunch.

We looked this place up online and it looked great. When we arrived I recognized the place and had actually been there one drunken night and remembered it being good. We walked in on a Saturday morning around 10:15. The place wasn't busy, maybe 6 parties. There was 6 of us and we were seated promptly. Our server took our drink order and everything seemed to be going alright. Then she came to take our meal order, that's when things went wrong. In the middle of taking our order she was nodding off as if she was on heroin, or more than likely, pain pills. We had to repeat ourselves to her multiple times to get the order right. We then waited for well over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. While we were waiting the table behind us got up and left before their food came out. Once our food started to arrive everything was wrong. Only one meal had special instructions but every single meal came out wrong and with sides missing. Once we finally got some refills on our drinks we began to eat our food. I ordered biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs over medium and a side of bacon. I got biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs over hard, and a side of hash browns. Luckily they put bacon on my girlfriends sandwich which wasn't supposed to have bacon so I ate that. My biscuit tasted like it was made a month ago, I took two bites and  pushed it aside. I then took a bite of hash browns, again, they tasted extremely old and were cold. Disgusting, I pushed them aside. It's pretty hard to screw up eggs, they did over cook them, but they were the only part of the meal I could eat. The same went for everyone else, the food was horrible and nobody finished their meal. One member of our party never even received their side of home fries even after asking for them twice. When the server came back by the table we asked to see the manager. She then brought us the check and told us she wouldn't charge us for the sides (which are included with the meal, never mind we didn't even get all of our sides). When we laughed and told her again to get the manager she informed us that \\"It wasn't all my fault, the kitchen messed up too\\". We finally talked to the manager who comped 50% of the bill and gave us 4 free meal tickets to come back, which we will never ever use.

With a menu spread across 26 pages, one would definitely be keen to come back for more to try the diverse choices, given the quality of food doing justice to the elaborate spread. \\nAt the same time, this restaurant struggles to keep up with good ambiance parameters, and thus the dilemma to chose between food exclusively and overall dining experience.\\n\\nMENU:\\nI wouldn't even list the menu in brief, for it might surpass the length of the review overall. Yes, the menu is that large and elaborate! With meat/seafood options and entree choices that one could possibly think of, the menu has it all. \\nJust have a look at the menu to believe it! \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nService is quite fast. The waiting staff helps you   clarify any questions regarding menu choices and makes suggestions based on your liking. They are also considerate to mention the cooking time for a particular order placed and prioritize placing orders which take relatively longer time to be prepared. All of the staff are courteous and promptly available.\\n\\n\\nFOOD:\\nOver dinner on a weekday, had the following ordered \\n1. HongKong style Wonton soup ($3): with wontons and Ong choy (water spinach) in a hearty broth, the soup is full of refreshing flavors. \\n2. Steamed Chicken Sui Mai ($3.50): Although it tasted decent, the Sui Mai had dark meat used (meat from chicken thighs) which is not my personal favorite. I usually prefer white meat (from chicken breasts) for dumplings as it reduces chances of remaining undercooked and also has enhanced flavors.\\n3. Fried Chicken wings ($6.75): I so enjoyed these. The wings were fried to perfection and seasoned well. Crispy outside and juicy inside, the wings were truly delectable.\\n4. Broccoli Chicken (~$10): Steamed chicken with broccoli and peppers in white garlic sauce, this dish was quite tasty. The tender chicken in delicious sauce & veggies providing subtle flavors, it was an enjoyable dish.\\n5. Spicy shrimp with Chinese wine sauce in shell ($12.95): Crispy juicy shrimp with shell-on in a spicy wine sauce with garlic cloves, spring onions, bell peppers & chili peppers, this dish is about delicious Cantonese flavors. The portion is huge with as many as 15 large shrimps served. Absolutely scrumptious!\\n\\nI loved the food here. It's a delight to be served with delicious authentic Chinese cuisine. Presentation of food is decent. Each dish is fairly priced and serving portions are huge. The extensive menu makes you want to try more.\\n\\nAMBIANCE:\\nAs a dining restaurant,  the aspect of ambiance is a disappointment! I don't know what to point out particularly but this place just does not feel clean. Lack of ventilation, sticky carpet/floors, a below average decor, old looking table clothes & curtains, the place feels dingy. I also do not understand the banquet style seating. It's just not impressive. As I see from other reviews, this place has had health code issues. While I myself particularly couldn't find one on my visit, at the same time I am easily ready to believe so. Cleanliness and hygiene is something that this restaurant really needs to work on. \\n\\nLOCATION/PARKING:\\nLocated inside a shopping plaza in Chamblee Dunwoody Road, there is enough parking spots. However, this place is usually crowded.\\n\\nTo Sum Up:\\nSurely, I loved the food here, more so as this place offers authentic flavorful Chinese food. The major selling point of this place is its large & elaborate menu choice, owing to which I am keen to try other items. While I am fan of the food here, the ambiance due to low standards of cleanliness, is off putting. Accordingly, I am slightly averse to dine here and it's probably a good idea to have carry-out instead.\\nFor food and service, I would like to rate it a 4, but for ambiance a 2 at max. Owing to the latter, I rate this place a 3 overall.\\nNevertheless, I would recommend to try this place once, solely for it's delicious authentic Chinese food and extensive menu choices."},{"name":"Bombay Kitchen Authentic Indian Cuisine","address":"4107 Lawrenceville Hwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"Sorry, I'm unsure how this place received so many great ratings but this was my first and last order.

The servers were initially pretty cold to me (in great contrast to how the obvious regulars were being received) even though I came in with a smile and a friendly hello. They did warm up to me after a bit, but I could definitely sense an air of either negativity or hostility or whatever coming from them. They definitely looked down on the Hispanic kitchen staff and treated them like ass (sitting at the counter, this was pretty apparent), and overall, took a sort of, how should I say, WT know-it-all attitude. That said, enough smiles from me got them to warm up a bit.\\n\\nThe food was mediocre diner food. Nothing special at all, and at not very special prices. I ordered pretty simple food and it was adequate and edible and that's about all I can say for it. I would expect this type and quality of food from any given roadside diner anywhere in America, which means that as far as the Portland-standard for food goes, it's way below.

The steak was tasteless with a mushy consistency.  As you can see from the pictures this was more of a soup than a stir fry.  Someone else ordered the mac n cheese which looked good but again very, very bland.   The cheese had what I would describe as a powdery taste (which i'm sure is not what's used,  but does taste as such).   This place has great potential if the quality and seasoning of the food were corrected.  That being said the atmosphere can be described as lively with a very, very crowded bar area which is directly within the dining area with lots of young adults in ages of about 22 and up.  Not a bad place to just grab a beer but would not recommend a mixed drink.

I'm not a big chicken-fried person, but my dinner companion had the chicken fried steak and I must admit that my fork wandered to her plate more than once. The portobella sandwich that my husband had was perfect and so large that he took some home to snack on later that day. (OK - I admit that I actually ate his left overs and he was quite miffed!). I had the special of the day - mouthwatering fish tacos that were some of the best in town.\\n\\nShall I go on and on and on about the quail, and the oysters, and the vegetarian ravioli in a spicy sauce that you could just put in a glass and drink?

This month it was Cakes and Ale. I'm surprised it took us this long to come here because I remember when it first opened I was really excited to try it out. \\nAfter reading the reviews on Yelp I tried to lower my expectations because it seemed like this place was really hit or miss. Following the advice given here, we did make a reservation which turned out not to matter because the place was only half full when we got there. \\nI immediately deducted a star because of the stupid curtains in the front. I understand that you're trying to keep out the cold air and I appreciate the thought, but having those curtains causes a huge traffic jam and they are just plain annoying. \\nAfter being seated at the most awkward table (this place is really crowded and poorly laid out) we were quickly greeted by the waitress and our drink order was taken. I just got a beer and my friend ordered the old fashioned from the cocktail menu (shout out to Mad Men!). Her drink was so poorly mixed that she couldn't even finish half of it. She's had an old fashioned before and knew what she was getting, but the fumes from the rye whiskey were overpowering.\\nWe decided to order several appetizers to share- the wild mushroom soup, the arancini (because we've heard so much about them), and the baked clams. Soon after ordering the waitress brought out bread and butter, which was really good. This bread was probably the best part of our meal. It was warm and crispy on the outside but chewy and yeasty on the inside. We asked for two more servings before the night was over.\\nThe food arrived in waves, which was a nice touch since our table was pretty small. The arancini came out first. It was as good as the other reviews said, but nothing that I would be dreaming about. The citrus and fennel pollen worked really well together and the flavor combination was something I hadn't experienced before. The fried balls were a little greasy on the outside, but rice and creamy on the inside. My friend commented that they might have been even better with a light dipping sauce, like a dill cream sauce or something. The wild mushroom soup was really good; rich and creamy with some pecan brittle on top that complemented the soup nicely. The baked clams were nothing special and there was bacon on top which would have been nice to mention on the menu since I don't eat pork.\\nOur server was very attentive and must have been some sort of contortionist to be able to navigate through the, by now, full dining room. \\nUnfortunately, after all the hype and expectations, I was disappointed.

Our food was slow coming out of the kitchen, so the manager comped us some chili cheese fries, which were huge and messy and good.  So, points for that.

I was so disappointed in this place, I am starting the review while still sitting at the table, waiting on our check. Lets start right there. We walking in shortly after 7:30PM. I sat in the car waiting for someone else for 15 minutes, no one walked out. We walk in, we are the only customers. Oh, but wait...as we walk up, the gentleman greets us with a paper takeout menu, asking if we wanted to just grab a menu to go? Should have seen that as a sign! But, it is 8:24, not another soul has entered.  We have completed the lackluster meal & we are WAITING FOR THE CHECK! \\nWhy is the rating a 2 star? I typically reserve 1 stars for places where the food was inedible, not thoroughly cooked, etc. Think of this as more a 1.5 star review. \\nSo, after we sit down, wherever we like, the waiter brings us a menu & olive oil/balsamic for a dip for our bread. I thought the bread was overdone, but I was starving. Lets address this 'parmesan cheese'. If you are a REAL, AUTHENTIC Italian spot, it is NOT okay to serve Kraft Parmesan cheese. It is too soft and not of the proper consistency.  Also, the water cups are too small. They have the water in juice cups. 2 sips, done... Who are they serving, small toddlers? \\nNow for meal... we had the gnocchi with shrimp & crab sauce.  There were 3 shrimp on the plate! Three... and the crab was just torn shreds of crabmeat. Maybe an ounce if you raked it altogether. We had the roasted salmon with broccoli & pasta. If you are leaving this restaurant to shop for food, you arrive at Farmers market before Costco. Meat is cheaper & FRESHER. For some odd reason, they put dehydrated mushrooms on top of the fish with a whole bunch of cut cherry tomatoes.  The broccoli and pasta were drowned in butter.\\nI almost forgot to mention about the starter.  The soup.  They have a broth that is just simmering...  When someone asks for soup, they throw the 'seafood' on top and serve it.  \\n\\nThe 'dinner menu' is significantly costlier than the lunch menu, but it seems that they serve the same food.  All in all, we wasted money coming here and unless some extreme changes are made, anyone who comes behind us will do the same.  If you are serving authentic food, then you can charge authentic prices.  But, if you are going to take the cheap route, then the prices need to reflect that.  Also, if you are going to assume that everyone who comes to the door is coming to get a menu to go home with, then you are never going to have anyone to actually come to sit down in your place."},{"name":"Dapper Duck Bar","address":"28 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"At this small bar, we did not think we would find such great food.

We ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with coleslaw ($5) and the soup/sandwich combo ($7). I ordered the soup of the day which was mushroom soup and a turkey sandwich with red onions, lettuce and some sort of French dressing sauce. Valerie liked her bbq chicken sandwich but thought the chicken should have been shredded and not chopped and liked her coleslaw as well (it wasn't drowning in mayo!) I enjoyed my mushroom soup because it was a light flavorful soup that had a hint of thyme and potatoes in it as well. I liked the fact that it wasn't heavy cream soup which I think is perfect for a light lunch! My sandwich also came with fried potato chips too! Since Val had only spent a whopping $5 on lunch, she decided to splurge on the $5 carrot cake. The cake was a little dry and had a lemony cream center filling but overall it was very tasty indeed! Their website does not offer the listing of their lunch specials but they do offer a variety of daily specials. Both of us agreed that this was a great meal for $10!

I love their appetizers.  The chicken wing is fried golden brown and flavorful... most places are either flavorful but lack the goldeness or viscera, GOT TO TRY!! pretty cheap too. The other mouth watering thing is their beef teriyaki sticks omg soo good.  Most places now a days deep fry them and which takes away the flavor but Braintree Jade keeps it old fashion and uses a grill.  The beef teriyaki is as good as it gets better than chinatown =). I love appetizers hahha but i am really picky too.  \\nAnother thing that I loved was their chicken fingers.  They use a good size WHITE chicken meat piece and not-so overly battered.  Like previous review, the chicken is fresh and juicy =).  They are bigger than average too.  They are like 4 inches long which is so worth it (Other restaurants' chicken fingers are usually like 1/2 the size and have more batter than chicken).  \\nTheir crab ragoon is so-so.  It is a lot of cream cheese...not a big fan of it but if u love them cheesy go for it. I love a lot of flavor so this just didn't do it for me.  You can get a pretty decent meal here and there is always free hot tea.  The managers are pretty nice too.  It is a self serve place. This is your better than average fast food restaurant.  I gave it 4 stars because I think this is a hidden jewel for Americanized Chinese appetizers minus 1 for the crab ragoon (there are other places that add like scallions and stuff).

The scallop risotto was perfectly seasoned, and the scallops were big and sweet.\\n\\nWe both opted for the steak for the main course. While the meat was good, the highlight for me was the mushroom medley on the side.

My wife and I came here for a date night after it sat on our bookmark list for over a year - for some reason every time we wanted to try a new place, it was pushed aside.  What were we thinking?!  A beautiful restaurant, the dining room and courtyard is tucked back from the high street, soft lighting against exposed brick walls make it warm and inviting.  The chef running this bistro was trained in Charleston, SC and like the city itself, his food mixes sophistication and low-country soul.  We started off with a recommended Spanish white wine which was wonderful and notably the entire wine menu was well balanced and accessible; lots of variety across regions and price points that didn't push you deep into your wallet for a great bottle.  First time at this restaurant and mindful of the chef's background, we decided to split their staple shrimp and grits as well as a grilled watermelon salad with fried smelts.  Boy, what a treat.  The shrimp and grits was incredible, one of the best I have had across any restaurant in the south, creamy grits and a rich, reduced piquant sauce.  The grilled watermelon was outstanding, the sweet, caramelized watermelon contrasted with salty, crispy fried smelts and the peppery greens was amazing and frankly almost too much food - so good.  For mains we had salmon and scallops.  My wife's broiled salmon was wonderful with pepper and vegetables, but my scallops with the creamed corn sauce and bacon jam was incredible, a balance of salty and sweet, just awesome.  Finished off our meal with a slice of their decadent pecan pie (Houston's Good Co. ain't got nothing on this pecan pie), coffees, and a glass of port.

Eggs and pancakes for breakfast were unheard of there, and it became the first thing I thought of longingly when I woke up each morning. Yes, IHOP is a chain, but the fact that I intensely craved it in Europe and yearned for it after two hours of physical exertion tells you something. It's dependable, incredibly hearty, and cheap. I usually make around 8374658 changes to my order, and no IHOP has ever messed up. I also love that they offer eggbeaters substitutions and sugar-free syrup.

But, this past Sunday made me not want to go back there again. I work in the service industry and so does my boyfriend. We get it. Things can get tough if something goes wrong with the kitchen or whatever. Can I just say though that COMMUNICATION is the key. - We brought all of our friends here Sunday, Server was rude, water cups empty until we asked multiple times for refills, didn't bring someone a coke then when asked for it gave us a face and said \\"Um, oooook\\". Our food came out 20 mins after 2 people of our party got theirs. One of our steaks were sent back, My poached eggs on my Benedict were hard boiled eggs. And when I asked if she could fix it she rudely replied.- \\"Okay...well, what do you want me to do about it?\\" We asked for a manager to speak to, he came over and really didn't seem like he cared AT ALL about our situation, he took care of my food but when we continued to talk to him, he cut my friend off and told her to let him finish speaking, because he's trying to apologize and say \\"I'm Sorry.\\"  Uhm wow. And the tone of that wasn't very it wasn't very sincere AT ALL. He continued to say how tough the day was and stuff went wrong in the kitchen and that's why our food came out at different times. Okay if this was gonna happen why didn't you let us know that when we sat down. Communication. That's all! Anyway after all that, it really turned me off from going there again.

The ambiance was nice and the views of the river were relaxing. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the food at Canoe. The waiter was extremely polite and knew the menu front and back with the ability to make recommendations from any section. I was impressed with the freshly baked bread (although a bit hard) and liked that everything is prepared freshly. My favorite part of the meal were the appetizers. I shared these though, so it gave me high expectations for the entree. I recommend the shrimp egg rolls and the parmesean truffle fries. Although too much truffle leaves an odd after taste. I ordered the crispy chimchurri chicken tacos, because I didn't really know what else to order because of some of the add-ons (i.e. truffle oil, hot mustard mayo, sweet pepper remoulade) to the basic sandwiches or entrees that I'm more familiar with. I should've went with my first gut which was to order the salmon, but I didn't want the spinach and spaghetti squash salad and I was afraid to substitute the chef's recipe with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. I figured that tacos are simple enough and when the waiter told me that dark meat was used, I envisioned more flavor. Unfortunately, the dish was bland. It was an interesting combination. I didn't expect the beans to be cold. I liked the crunch of the \\"taco shell\\", but the chicken had no flavor. I did like the orange sauce that was drizzled on top. I had to add salt and pepper a few times. For dessert we split a small cheese cake (literally 3 bites finished it and there were 3 of us) and the. Infamous popcorn ice cream sundae. The sundae was large and rich. I definetly recommend it over the cheesecake for sharing. I don't think I could finish it alone. \\nOverall, the experience was okay.

Pete orders a sandwich called the Brooklyn Avenue, which he says is \\"pastrami with the cole slaw right on the sandwich!\\" As soon as I heard it, I thought, \\"Oh snap, they sounds just like that sandwich I had at Gourmand's a few weeks ago.\\" End scene.\\n\\nToday, I was hit with a monster craving for a delicious sandwich, so naturally I made the five minute drive to Gourmand's for a Brooklyn Avenue. Only it isn't called a Brooklyn Avenue. Here, it is called an Orgy. And it is divine. Tons o' pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw, and Russian dressing on rye. Leaves you stuffed to the gills and happy, happy, happy. I washed it down with a Live Oak Hefe, naturally, but could have chosen from several other local beers on tap. I do have to admit, however, that I'm not a fan of their house made potato chips. They're way overcooked and taste like stale grease. But they somewhat make up for it with the little pile of spicy pickled veggies in the opposite corner of the tray. I'm a happy camper when pickled onions are in the mix. \\n\\nI look forward to the day I try the broccoli beer cheese soup in a bread bowl. I just know that it will be amazing.\\n\\nThe building and ambience are hole in the wall/divey, which works for me. The first night I went happened to be trivia night, which was a big plus. I love trivia, but it got a little loud and crowded, which makes it hard to just enjoy dinner. Today it was quiet with just a few other tables of patrons. I look forward to trying it out late night for drinks with friends. \\n\\nAll in all, Gourmand's is wonderful and I intend to make myself a regular. You'd be wise to do the same."},{"name":"King Harvest","address":"1502 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"King Harvest has been my favorite hummus for a long time now but it wasn't until today that I actually got to their location.

Our party of 5 was unfortunate enough to arrive right after a party of 15 who apparently didn't bother to call ahead. Seriously, who does that? While we waited, a few in our party decided to get a drink at the bar so one of my friends asked if we were able to take a drink out front while we waited. She was told we could and then was pretty much ignored for a few minutes. When she was finally able to get the bartender's attention, she asked for a wine list and then we were ignored for another few minutes. When he  finally took their order, he was apologetic so I'll give him that. They got their drinks and we waited for our table. Oddly, there were a few empty tables so I'm not really sure what we were waiting for. \\n\\nFinally we were seated and then.....we waited. And waited. I'll digress here for a moment to interject that I have worked as a hostess, server, cocktail waitress and bartender so, knowing the ins and out of the restaurant industry and the many factors that can affect service, I'm extremely tolerant and patient when it comes to eating out. But, really, this was starting to approach annoying even for me. In the meantime, one of the persons in our party noticed a hair in his beer about halfway through. Not sure if he didn't feel comfortable saying anything or if he just got tired of waiting but he eventually just picked it out. I was just about to get up to let the hostess know that no one had been to our table after about 7 minutes when our server showed up. She was also very apologetic so, ok, at least they've acknowledged both of their missteps so far. However, one of the first things she told us was that they weren't going to be able to do separate checks because of the large party. Um, okaaaay? Not sure why that should have had to affect us and it was an inconvenience since other than one couple, the rest of us were solo. Luckily, I had cash but that's not usually the case. Anyway, she was very nice, knowledgeable, answered our many questions and gave suggestions. \\n\\nI showed her my Yelp check in for the free vegetarian spring rolls and also ordered the 5 spice tofu and curry coconut shrimp. I couldn't tell you in detail what everyone else ordered since I don't eat meat other than seafood so I wasn't partaking in their food. I know there were some kind of tacos (chicken satay, I think), some chicken curry, 5 spice pork and some noodle bowls. Oh yeah, and some edamame so I did have some of that. It was a little overdone and didn't have enough sea salt on it. \\n\\nOur items came out very slowly and one at a time. Since it's tapas-style, I was expecting this but it got a little annoying when a couple of us had gotten a couple items and others hadn't gotten anything. Then....more hair. The person who had hair in his beer also had a piece of hair on the edge of his bowl of curry. Again, he didn't say anything, though...not sure why. \\n\\nMy shrimp was good but nothing special. It was 4 pieces of coconut shrimp with a curry dipping sauce. The sauce had a brothy taste and wasn't sweet so it was a strange combination. My 5 spice tofu was excellent. It was very crispy and the 5 spice taste was great, although quite salty. There was a small amount of cooked onions and peppers served on it but it could have used more. I felt it could have used a dipping sauce of some sort as well so I ordered some sweet Thai chili sauce, which went really well with it. \\n\\nMy friend who got the tacos said they were a little too spicy for her (and she had told the server that she didn't care for spicy) and also said they were very greasy. Everyone else seemed to enjoy the noodle bowls, curry (sans the hair) and 5 spice pork. After a while, I had to tell the server that I never got my spring rolls. Again, she was very apologetic and I got them within a few minutes. \\n\\nTwo of the people in our party have since been back and said the service sucked. I haven't written you off, Hawkers; I'll go back, maybe on a weeknight or weekend afternoon, and hopefully I won't be following a party of 15 who didn't bother to call ahead."},{"name":"Black Horse Tavern","address":"32 Waterfield Rd","city":"Winchester","stars":"3","text":"Had a great dinner!

I figured with the description it would be a brown sauce on the veggies not the entire thing. \\n\\nThe Spring rolls had an oily taste to it, and burnt flavor on top of it. After eating one my stomach felt like it was doing flipflops.  \\n\\nThe only thing they got right was the Hot and Sour soup, and only because it was served hot. \\n\\nI went back to ask if this could be rectified, they told me I got what I ordered. \\n\\nI showed them a picture of Dragon & Pheonix and even showed them a version I made...I was told by the owners that the chef is Chinese and that they go to him for the Chinese menu because they know nothing of it. So they go by what the Chef, which worked in Chinatown (which I believe is BS) said was how things were meant to be. \\n\\nI am sorry to say this, but, What?! I wish I could have a job with that kind of security. \\n\\nYou own the place, you had better know what your chef is serving.  You had better research what the definition of what is served compared to what is served. \\n\\nHow these people stay in business I don't know, but this is insane, I will not be going back there again."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I have been coming to Duh Kuh Bees for the last 8 years, even with the different owners nothing has changed.

Service was good, wine list was varied (always a good thing) and the best part about it is ... they satisfied my urge for Chicken & Friends!\\n\\nFor those of you not as familiar with Houstons, the restaurant had a number of dishes on its menu that have become - er - institutions. Although removed from the menu, regulars could visit the Houstons of choice and order those items confident that although no longer on the menu, Houstons \\"loved\\" them enough to continue to support their food preferences. Well, that has been slowly changing and there are many instances (Bethesda Woodmont Grill, listen up!) when the request was refused. Not so at the Buckhead Houstons!\\n\\nSo, Chicken & Friends consists of a chicken breast, smothered in BBQ sauce, topped with ham and cheese. Delish - and a dish that I used to order at the Dallas Houstons at least once a week. I had even convinced my son that it was the best meal at Houstons and he was a regular participant in the enjoyment of the clucker and its best buds. Accompanied by 1-2 side dishes (the number changed from 2 to 1 over the years), I always ordered the baked potato and usually one of the seasonal vegetables. \\n\\nWell, the meal was not a disappointment - Chicken & Friends, baked potato and fresh tomatoes with a little balsamic vinegrette and basil. ...and my son who is not at Georgia Tech was there to enjoy it with me (his own of course - I don't share!). \\n\\nThey had a Frank Family Chard on the list. I'm usually a red wine drinker but the Frank (one of my favorite wineries) was a requirement. \\n\\nAt the end, the manager came over to ask how our meal was (did she read minds?!).

I don't really understand the decor here. One half of the restaurant/bar definitely seems cooler than the other half and I think it is because one half has a lower ceiling so it just seems more comfy. The side with the higher ceiling has no artwork or anything really, just brightly painted walls which is cool I guess, but it just felt a little uninviting to me and some of my friends we were with. My other problem is the kitchen placement. You should think about putting a door on that kitchen opening or at least switching to a non-blinding florescent light because that light just pours out into what is trying to be a warm, inviting space. Sitting at the bar with my glass of Malbec I was often distracted by this bright light shining in.

Let's relive it anyway.\\n\\nI had the boyfriend place an order here while I was at the store so that I'd go pick it up after I was done.  The only mistake they did make was to leave out the order of fried shrimp.  That made me think that the order of . . . something else, I don't remember what at this point, was something we didn't order.  So, I told him it looked like we got one wrong thing.  The man up front apologized, put in an order for the fried shrimp and left the \\"wrong\\" order in the bag (well, box, we ordered too much!).  I texted the boyfriend and found out I was wrong and he did order what I thought he hadn't.  I felt bad and tried to pay for it, but he was very insistent that I didn't pay for it and helped me on my way.  One small misstep on their part (leaving out the shrimp), but a much larger misstep on my part and they handled it much better than they should have.\\n\\nSo, when I got home, I really wanted to be able to give this place five stars.

Their fare samples from dishes across Southeast Asia executed well and for the most part authentically -- but where they deviate from strict interpretations of the flavors, the result is still quite good and, I feel, captures the \\"essence\\" of the dish.\\n\\nThe concept for Hawker's is right in the name: it's inspired by street hawkers found selling treats on the streets of every town and city throughout Southeast Asia. It also seems to take a cue from Singapore's concept of \\"hawker stations\\" where food stands are gathered into a common 'food court' like space where you can choose from a variety of dishes and styles. The walls actually feature some pretty cool photos of real hawkers from around Asia.\\n\\nWe are in Indonesia, Singapore and the like fairly often (my wife is Indonesian-born and I am Eurasian), and when coming back to Florida, it's definitely hard to find tasty renditions of things like Singapore Mei Fun, Nasi Goreng (Indonesian), Char Kway Teow, Laksa and Mee Goreng. This is an oasis in a desert Southeast Asian cuisine that's not Thai-only. They also started featuring a selection of Bao buns.\\n\\nAlso, because they use actual quality ingredients, their food doesn't use added MSG (beyond what is naturally occurring in soy sauce, etc.). I am MSG sensitive, and this is a worry with almost every Asian joint -- and I'm skeptical when this is claimed. However, true to their word they didn't use it, as I had no adverse reaction.\\n\\nThe design of the dining area is cool. The atmosphere is like an upscale loose rendition of a hawker station, with 'aluminum siding sheet' and reclaimed wood plank wall accents, distressed metal chairs and stools like you'd see in a food stall (but comfy), and asian newspaper print designs on the tables to represent using the material as table coverings. Overall, the experience is great each time we visit. \\n\\nThe restaurant uses a small-plate format (aka \\"tapas\\" portions to use Florida-friendly lingo) and diners share them 'family style', progressively ordering throughout the meal. Their menu is extensive, and thus far we haven't had anything bad, but here are some highlights:\\n\\nSingapore Mie Fun: rice noodles cooked in curry. It's a dry dish, not a soup. It tastes great and captures the spirit of Singapore's fusion pan-asian cuisine -- of which this is a perennial favorite.\\n\\nCurry Laksa: egg noodles in a coconut curry stew, loaded with a boiled egg, shrimp and chicken. Delicious, and something a bit hard to find other places!\\n\\nRoti Canai: Malaysian flatbread with a red curry dipping sauce. If you like Indian Naan or Chinese scallion pancake bread, you'll like this.\\n\\nNasi Goreng and Mie Goreng are likewise are hard-ish to find elsewhere, as they are Indonesian staples, but restaurants specializing in Indonesian food are rare.\\n\\nA final note is that one of the items they get right in capturing the 'street food' flavor of the region is that they use wood charcoal grills, not gas. When traveling through the region, you do notice that this is the method used by actual cooks in the area, particularly street vendors -- as wood charcoal is far more affordable in these places than propane.\\n\\nHighly recommended."},{"name":"Rustic Kitchen","address":"210 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"drinks are well made--flavorful, not too strong, not too watered down. scotch selection is excellent but the food has a lot to be said for."},{"name":"Pad Thai Cafe","address":"1116 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Never disappoints.

I went to BWW to enjoy a dinner with my roommate and my boyfriend. Our waiter told us all boneless wings were 50% off so we proceeded to order a large and a small (we wouldn't have ordered so much without the discount). When we got the check the large wings were originally $20 and the bill charged us $15 while the small was originally $10 and we were charged $7. That is not 50% off. When we called our waiter over to ask why our bill did not reflect the correct deal he said he told us the wrong deal which is not OUR fault and we should have been compensated for what we were told... instead he said \\"it's basically the same thing\\" which it is not. Not only does it stop there BUT as I was walking back to my table from the bathroom there was a large puddle of water on the floor that they decided to mop the floor with in the center passageway and I slipped and fell extremely hard. I preceded to walk to my table and sat down to ice my knee since I had ACL surgery before. The manager then came to our table (probably because he saw the fall) and never asked once if I was ok and never apologized for having big puddle of water in the middle of the passageway. I wasn't offered any ice and I wasn't asked if I was ok. I have woken up with bruised knees and a sore arm and I am extremely upset at BWW for their lack of customer service. I will be reaching out shortly and hopefully there is a different manager available to help since the one from last night obviously doesn't care about their guests.

She finally stopped sorting tickets pushed someone off of a register to give us a refund.  She huffed and puffed the entire time, never once apologizing for the wait, or offering us anything for our trouble and inconvenience.  When my girlfriend said, \\"it just would have been nice if someone would have given us an update when we asked,\\" she looked at us, threw up her hands, and said \\"we're really busy.\\"  That was it!

It's one thing to be a busy at a new restaurant and wait a little longer for food, but to handle a 20+ minute delay on food without an apology, or even acknowledgement is just plain bad service.

I assumed it would be like any other cafe/pastry shop where the food is sitting out under a glass case all day getting dried up and when you order they just grab it and nuke it or something; I was so wrong. We ordered the mushroom tartine ($10) and lime pulled chicken ($12) dishes. Beautiful, large, entree-like servings came out. It was absolutely delicious, and so fresh and healthy tasting. Even the side salad (just a lettuce mix), which usually is an afterthought, was bright and crispy with just the right amount of dressing. I will definitely be coming back and paying full price at the cafe  - the freshness is so worth the slightly pricey cost.

If you are going to play darts just get your beer from the bar it is the fastest way. Several people have suggested coat hooks by the boards but none have appeared. Also on very crowded nights groups will stand in the lanes and if you want to play it is a pain to get them out of the way.\\n\\nThe place gets crowded most nights and seating is first come first serve but I've never had a problem finding seating with random groups if you just ask nicely.

Of the 24 seats, 8 are at the bar. We entered at 7:30 on Valentines Tuesday and every table was occupied.  Before I could look around, one of the staff was enthusiastically indicating to a couple standing to put their coats on. We got the table closest to the bar and kitchen.\\n\\nThe staff move at a fast pace but politely, and having never been there I had to ask for more menu time twice.  Just so they didn't think we were deadbeats, I ordered Miso soup and Ebi sunumono to start for my wife and 9 Yr old daughter and I elected to try the Uzaku (Eel Sunomono) and some Sake to give me time to examine the fresh sheet.\\n\\nPast posters have said the Miso is great and I fully agree! I don't know what it is (hope they don't add MSG?) but it was rich and savoury with a clean finish after each sip. Best in recent memory.\\n\\nI'd drank some sake and decided if I was going to break the bank on the fresh sheet and the Sunomono still hadn't come!  When it did I knew why... The Uzaku is grilled and served hot in a salad of thin sliced cucumber instead of rice noodle like the Ebi.  At $8 it was a pricey choice for Sunomono, but I wanted something different. 3 good sized Eel portions in the salad justified the cost and I enjoyed it despite some small irritating bones. Hot foods take time to prepare here as I later found with our Tempura.\\n\\nI wanted something different that you don't normally see on regular sushi joint menus. They had it, but MY problem was the cost. Local spot prawns at $3.95 each, Hamachi sashimi is $24. So I chose 4 peices of Hamachi Nigiri instead at ~$4 ea. I swear we were served Toro Nigiri. Did they pull a fast one on us hoping we not notice? \\n\\nAt $18 I ordered an assorted sashimi as I always do. Was hoping for some exotic stuff. It was only 4 kinds of fish. I'd rather have 2 pieces of 6 or 8 kind of fish instead!  However, for that cost there was the expected Maguro and Tako but the Salmon was Sockeye instead of Atlantic, and opposite that was Hamachi slices.\\nI'd have preferred to pay $14 for that plate, BUT... It was all very clean and fresh tasting. The Maguro didn't have the sometimes bitter finish to it that you've all tasted. Very enjoyable.\\n\\nOyster Motoyaki served on a big shell. Caremelized at points, close to being charred but this probably added to the flavour. Not bad, but not stellar. \\n\\nWife and daughter shared 4 Maki, all done pretty well with nice presentation. And tempura was done pretty well, despite the wait... I'd forgotten we ordered it by the time it arrived.\\n\\nFinal bill was $107 less taxes and tip for 3 of us with sake, sodas and ice cream. They missed my 3rd sake on the bill, yay :)\\n\\nFreshest, cleanest fish served well with few frills. A little pricey for such a small operation I think, but they offer up the genuine basic product."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Love the almost sphere.

The food is decent, comes in huge portions, and is maybe even somewhat authentic (I'm not really able to judge this). It's not a fancy place, it's just a self-service thing. The price reflects this too, and people shouldn't be expecting a fancy meal. I think 3 stars are fine for a place like this, it doesn't mean this place is crap, the description for 3 stars is \\"A-OK\\", and that's what I think this place is. \\n\\nThe one thing I do need to criticise is this: The last time I was there there were several bits of meat in my vegetarian dish. Now I work in a restaurant myself, and I know that there isn't always time to thoroughly wash out the pan to prepare a meat-free dish. Surely this would be done for allergies, but vegetarianism is not an allergy. I usually choose to be blissfully ignorant about this and just try to not think about my meal cooking the remnants of meat juices. But when a bit of beef shows up in my vegetarian dish, I can't ignore that. I don't mean to be one of \\"those\\" people, but seeing those bits of it just made me lose my appetite completely. And the chef shouldn't be ignoring that either when he is about the prepare a vegetarian dish. I think that is a level of cleanliness I can reasonably expect from a place like Pad Thai. I'm not expecting the pan to be scrubbed clean and disinfected. I just want the bits of meat rinsed out.\\n\\nThe meat in my veggie dish would alone would have knocked down my review to 2 stars, but I think they handled it really well then I pointed it out to them. I didn't want to make a big scene, so I just brought my half-eaten dish up to the counter, pointed out the problem and kindly advised them to rinse out the pans a bit better next time they are preparing a vegetarian dish. They apologized, I told them it was no biggie, and went back to my table. A few minutes later the woman who took my order came back to the table to give me a full refund on the meal. I never would have insisted on that, and I never even mentioned I wanted that when I pointed it out to her.

We got there right before a huge line swarmed in. Brioso is just like Phenix in that it has a hodgepodge of different furniture items throughout the cafe that are attempting to be homey. I'm not quite sure how homey they're trying to be - there was a man in there that was sleeping on the couch. I don't care if he's homeless, an employee, or even a normal paying customer. It was weird and inappropriate. But you know, the place was big enough that my dad and I could sit far away. It was just very, very uncomfortable.\\n\\nAnyway, my dad had a maple latte while I had an iced mocha. The man making my dad's drink took extra care with it and made some nice latte art, but for some reason it was served in a glass instead of a cup? He felt bad asking the barista for a to go cup, but honestly what kind of common sense needs to be had to put a hot drink in a mug? My mocha came out with considerably less fanfare, albeit it done come in an acceptable to-go cold drink cup.\\n\\nThe mocha was fine, and my dad really liked the latte. I was really bummed to find out they won't be serving a breakfast or lunch menu anymore. I was a bit hungry, and I was hoping to get some of the food everyone on Yelp was raving about. Their signs mention their desire to focus on the coffee, but I can't help but think not serving the food people have been talking about will hurt their business. I just can't think that their coffee and apathetically places pastries are going to carry this place.\\n\\nMy dad and I had a great seat to watch the parade, but I just had an eh experience all around. Between the complete lack of concern for its appearance, the disappearance of their food menu, and common sense issues, I don't understand why I would ever choose Brioso over Phenix."},{"name":"Blenders and Bowls - Downtown","address":"206 E 4th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"WOW.

My husband and I are huge foodies and love traveling while trying to get the full flavor of each city passed through and I must say we'd make it a point to come back to Houston's. We ordered the lobster  crab cakes (which came with two sides served as a meal), succulent prime rib (which covered the entire plate), perfectly prepared filet mignon and buttery snapper all served to perfection! Each came with generous sides be sure to try a variety of them. Each meal was so delicious I would rather have stuffed my self to no tomorrow then stop. Our favorite was the prime rib (which is usually a hit or miss at most places) but the prime rib was cooked to absolute perfection with so much flavor and perfectly pink, it definitely needed no such jus sauce at all. The filet had to be our second choice, cooked to medium rare with each bite melting in your mouth. I certainly recommend trying Houston's!

The night started off with a friendly greeting from the hostess who was very forward with us about the two hour wait. We decided it was worth waiting for because we have lived in the area for the last 9 months, anxiously awaiting the opening since construction started. The hostess asked for my number and entered into their system, letting us know we would get a text to confirm the check in. The text also included a link to MyTableUp, which allowed us to view the number of parties in front of us as well as wait times. I personally love expectation setting, so I very much appreciated it.\\n\\nKnowing we would be waiting for up to 2 hours, we headed down to the lower bar to grab a drink. In case you aren't aware, the restaurant is laid out across two floors with a bar on each. The upper floor is more of a traditional setup with a huge center bar and high top tables surrounding it. As you walk downstairs, the lower floor has more of a restaurant vibe. It's slightly quieter and there is more seating with a very attentive wait staff going table to table. Both floors are nicely decorated -- you can tell the owners did not skimp on any of the details.  Huge flat screen TVs are all over the place for patrons to watch games, good music is playing in the background and everything is super clean.  The lower floor also has really cool exposed brick with subway tile and more of an industrial look.\\n\\nOK so back to our experience on the lower floor... We started by ordering a drink standing at the bar. After about 20 minutes (Dorset Hall was absolutely packed the entire time we were there so I would imagine all patrons had this experience), the couple sitting in front of us at the bar left and kindly let us know we could grab their seats. As soon as we sat down, the bartender asked what he could get us from drinks to food. We started with another drink and then checked the app for wait time -- still 14 tables ahead of us, but down from 19 to start. Knowing we still had some time, we ordered the mussels. They came out within 10 minutes and they were AMAZING. We opted for the red sauce but white was also an option. Not only were they delicious but the portion size was massive... Little did we know, this would be the theme for the night, delicious and substantial meals.\\n\\nAbout halfway into our mussels, I received a text that our table was ready (roughly 90 minutes from arriving). We decided to stay at the bar to order dinner since we already had the mussels, prime seating in front of the Bruins game and an awesome bartender.  After the mussels, we ordered our meals -- I got the steak tips and my girlfriend got the fish tacos. And delicious and massive, so big that we boxed up half of each meal to take home.\\n\\nEven though we were stuffed, my girlfriend insisted on the brownie sundae to end the night. And it was well worth it!\\n\\nAfter spending almost 2.5 hours at Dorset Hall in total, we paid the bill and headed home. Our entire bill was sub $100 which was a pleasant surprise. We are used to eating downtown and easily paying over $100, so we almost couldn't believe how great the service and food was for under that amount.\\n\\nWe will certainly be back and have already recommended Dorset Hall to a few friends within the last hour!"},{"name":"Yenching Restaurant","address":"1326 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is crowded only because it's one of the only Chinese restaurants in Harvard Square.

In such a high volume restaurant it can be extremely time consuming to brew our own iced tea while keeping up with coffee and other beverages we mix ourselves. We are more than happy to make you a brewed iced tea upon request whenever you visit in the future - simply ask your server.  We are always willing to go that extra step to ensure you enjoy your time in our pub.\\n\\nNow I ask you. What makes serving instant iced tea any better than serving instant coffee? They have to brew the coffee, don't they? They don't seem to get the connection there. Also, I find the suggestion that I can get brewed tea on request to be counterproductive for a staff that needs to \\"spend more time on the floor with our guests and less time... Rest assured though, that I will be asking for brewed tea. This whole thing reeks of a way to cut corners and save money.\\n\\nI would like to suggest here that those who frequent Deschutes Brewery in The Pearl and believe that instant iced tea is as big of a faux pas as I, to please voice your opinion. Together with a very loud voice, we can get them to change back."},{"name":"Flames Restaurant II","address":"746 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing take out Jamaican joint.

Upon entering,  you might be thinking \\"little bit swank\\", or at least, \\"pretty swank for freakin' No-Po!\\" and you'd be right! So there's a little bit of swank in the mix-- whoever did the interior design clearly has an eye and a talent. But at the same time, there's a lounge-y kinda vibe going on in there, and I can't believe that is accidental. If there had been a grand piano in a corner, w/a tuxedoed hired gun, tickling the ivories, killing 'em, I wouldn't have been in the least bit surprised. Alas, no piano, no tuxedoed hired gun--at least not yet! But they do schedule live music to boogie on down w/o inhibition or remorse...\\n\\n\\n The plush furniture in the corner, past the bar where the gigando big screen dwelleth is indeed lounge central. There is an outdoor patio area which has also benefited from sagacity and masterful attention, just as the interior of the building has. Hard to believe, as you sit and sip your suds, that you're a stone's throw from Hawker's Locker, and the timeless tire shop just kitty corner to this place. Supposedly the big screen is reserved for movies on Sunday eves, but when I was there they (graciously and serendipitously) let the Sunday night NFL game play out.\\n\\n\\nLet's turn our attention to the menu for a moment. They have tomato bisque daily, as well as du jour specials, that are nothing short of decadent, the perfect accompaniment to their paninis.... I, being a painful dork, had to have the \\"Gaba-gool\\" (spicy capicola) and it was splendid. It made me shed a sentimental tear, thinking of that big lug Tony Soprano, and wonder if he really did buy his ticket, and if there ever will be a movie to answer some of the lingering questions from the series. Don't stop believin'!\\n\\n\\nLive music opportunities, as noted above, as well as Tuesday trivia are highlights of the ongoing schedule. By all appearances, this entire operation shows many signs of being a well-oiled and well run machine. I have no idea what degree of experience the owners/mgt. have in running such places, but have to give up huge praise to them for putting together such a classy venue---you know, the better for us to boogie our little tushies off...\\n\\n\\nFolks might blame it on all kinds of things, but as for me, you know I gotta blame it on the boogie...."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place to eat in Austin.

The sandwich must have been 3 - no 4 inches thick.  I had to make a plan for eating it.  I thought I would try cutting it with a fork and knife, but no, it was meant to be eaten with the hands.  I grasped it and sunk my teeth in and the flavors gushed into my mouth as my tongue grappled in ecstasy.  That sounds kinda naughty, but the sandwich was so delicious and with all those calories perhaps it was kinda naughty on my diet - whatever that is at the moment.  \\n\\nI was truly astounded at how massive the sandwich was and concluded that I might destroy my stomach if I ate all of it in one sitting.  So I only ate half, which has never ever happened to me.  Never have I saved half a sandwich for later.  I did eat the second half about 3 hours later and then didn't even have dinner that night I was so full.\\n\\nTo make sure I was confident in my mind-blowing experience I waited this extra day before actually writing the review to make sure everything was digested properly.

I always ordered the chrysanthemum tea which turned out to taste somewhat like either very diluted tea to like drainage water. It was awful, I never comprehend how can anyone messed up with tea. Perhaps the establishment has been trying to cut cost, it is hard to believe the owner does not realize how bad the tea taste. \\n\\nIt was the Labor Day weekend.

The tea tasted just how I expected it to be, dreadful!\\n\\nSo we ordered the following:\\n\\n1) pork porridge - I did not have that but two others did, they said that taste alright.\\n\\n2) BBQ pork bun - the buns were dry and coarse. They supposed to be fluffy. The meat fillings were bland. Oh not to mention, the size of the BBQ pork buns has shrunken tremendously.\\n\\n3) pan fried turnip cake - tasted weird. Too much rice flour.\\n\\n4) shrimp dumpling - the skin of the dumplings was rather tough.\\n\\nWe dared not ordered more. \\n\\nTotal bill including gratuity was closed to $30.

The pasta they use is perfect for soaking up all of the yummy cheese and the chorizo adds the right amount of spice to balance the creaminess. \\n\\nSadly the spicy chicken & waffles was just alright. The chicken was spicy, but the white meat just wasn't as juicy as I had hoped. The dish looks great with all the syrup, but it just the waffle soggy which was disappointing. I wish I ordered the Pork Belly Burger instead.

The upstairs dining area in particular offers a nice perspective of the counter and tables down below, though it's not always open.  I think the lineups here at lunchtime on weekdays is testament to the quality and price point of HGK.   In my opinion, they offer a much better product and experience than Chipotle.\\n\\nThough I've never tried their burritos, I can easily recommend their salads and soups.  They have four salads you can order off the menu - my favourite being the avocado taco salad.  You can also choose to make your own salad with infinite combinations, which I've had pretty good luck with as well.  Some of the options include white/brown rice, quinoa, mixed greens, chicken, chickpeas, apples, dried cranberries, basil, mint, goat cheese, etc etc.  As you might expect they have several choices of salad dressings to complete your meal.  Lastly, their Chipotle chicken soup is excellent, and if you're not starving, can be a meal on its own.\\n\\nIn terms of price,  the menu salads are around $9-$11 and the create-your-owns are $6.50 and up.  The burritos are in the $9 range and the soups are $5 each.  They also have hummus and chips for $3, a number of homemade ice creams ($6-$7)and large oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies for around $2.  The cookies are to die for.  \\n\\nThe staff are usually in a good mood and happy to be here, which is another reason I keep coming back.

They did say that I could come down early and possibly get a spot at the bar or get seated ahead of schedule, so we went over around 8 PM. I won't be making that mistake again.\\n\\nThe space is warm and inviting, but definitely small. By the time we arrived there was a waiting list just to get a spot at the bar and all of the tables were packed. There isn't any seating other than the bar and there really isn't much room to stand around. So, even though we got a few drinks while we waited, we constantly felt like we were in the way of the servers and incoming guests. I don't really fault the restaurant for this because we knowingly showed up an hour before our reservation, but I would have rather been given realistic expectations of what the waiting experience was going to be like. But, we did manage to eventually worm our way onto a couple of bar stools for the last 15 minutes or so of our wait.\\n\\nBecause we (kind of) knew what we were getting ourselves into by showing up an hour early, and because we were actually seated at the time of our reservation (to the minute actually), I didn't really have a BAD experience with the service. But, my hour of awkwardly standing around did give me time to observe the front of house for a while, and I think that the combination of popularity and a small space proves to be overwhelming to the staff on a busy night.\\n\\nWe were instructed by the hostess to place our drink orders with her instead of at the bar, as the sole bartender seemed to be overloaded at the time. I had no problem with that, in theory. But the hostess was running around like a chicken with her head cut off, both trying to wait on us and manage the constant influx of patrons, and she was failing at both tasks miserably. This was really the only part of the night that pissed me off.\\n\\nLook...I get it. Your bartender is overwhelmed and you are trying to pitch in to help her manage the workload. But if you want to volunteer yourself as my waitress, don't make me stand there waiting for my first drink for 15 minutes while you bounce around the room and ESPECIALLY don't give me a condescending eat-shit-and-die look when your bartender spots me and calls me over to ask for my drink order. She had a free moment and wanted to do her job. So don't come over and scold me for not \\"listening to you the first time.\\"\\n\\nThere were a few positive notes about our wait. I hadn't expected the house cocktail list to be as good as it was. I'm surprised that Cakes & Ale doesn't get more attention for their impressive drinks menu, like an H&F or Leon's does. \\n\\nThe other upside to the wait was that it gave us the chance to drool over the giant chalkboard menu and to try the first of our apps for the evening, the Arancini.The Arancini are little balls of risotto with citrus acid wrapped around a chunk of Pecorino reggiono, deep fried, and then dusted with fennel. These were delightful. The fried exterior carries a lot of flavor, though it wasn't greasy, and the fennel and citrus acid gives each mouthful just the appropriate amount of bite. I would recommend getting these, especially if you go with a group.\\n\\nBecause I can't resist trying a dish that I have never eaten before, I couldn't stop myself from ordering the Beef Tongue appetizer as well. Having never had beef tongue, I fully expected to get a mouthful of shoe leather, albeit flavor-packed shoe leather. I couldn't have been more wrong. The first thing that I noticed was how tender the beef tongue was. It wasn't \\"melt in your mouth\\" tender, but my teeth met with very little resistance with each bite. The combination of the tongue, salsa verde, and sunchoke remoulade pair wonderfully. This was way more satisfying that I expected.\\n\\nFor our entr√©es, my date went for the Gnocchi and Braised Guinea Hen and I ordered the Red Wine and Tomato Braised Wild Striped Bass with carrots, olives, turnips, and a sunchoke and potato puree.  While the flavor on the hen dish was good, and the Hen was well seasoned and prepared, I was a little less than thrilled with the gnocchi. Unfortunately, the texture was too mushy. But, overcooked gnocchi aside, the rest of the flavors were fresh, savory, and satisfying.\\n\\nThe bass was a nice, warming, comfort-food type dish. It didn't blow me away, but there were no disappointments either. I would order it again. \\n\\nI really enjoyed the meal here and I definitely plan to return, though I will make a point to arrive much closer to my actual reservation time. I love the fact that the menu changes so frequently and I'm looking forward to seeing what Allin and Wong cook up next."},{"name":"Gustav's Pub & Grill","address":"10350 SW Greenburg Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Have been a fan for 13 years now.

Hey, Gilligan, get your ass away from Ginger so she can sliver on down here! We found one small piece of ginger in our entire dish. I do enjoy good irony. \\n\\nThe Pho Tai was cool. And I mean literally, because it was on the cool side of tepid. I'm not a big fan of tepid, but Thai basil and hot cock sauce can mask a multitude of sins, especially if you're a pho fan who's hungry. We always admire the spring rolls and peanut sauce here. \\n\\nWhat makes this place a keeper for us is the casual atmosphere and the friendly and laid-back staff, who kept offering to join another table to ours to make more room for our stuff.

Upon closer look, it seems that for some reason, people have been posting pictures from the Shanghai Morning Restaurant not far from Yuan on this Yelp page.

The entrance is a little hidden and the d√©cor is not nearly as fancy as other similar restaurants around. \\n\\nFrom a paper menu only in traditional Chinese without pictures, we ordered the xiaolongbao, roasted duck and dan dan noodles. The xiaolongbao came out very quick and was pretty good and surprisingly affordable. But everything went south from there. \\n\\nThe next thing that they brought us was a huge place of tofu skin wrapped around mushrooms. We were confused and the waiter was not very nice about it. She showed us the receipt and we realized that we ordered a vegetarian roasted duck dish, an item under the meat section... Needless to say the dish was not very enjoyable. \\n\\nFinally, the dan dan noodles had zero meat, all I could taste was peanuts and peanut butter, and it was extremely heavy. FYI, dan dan noodles by definition are supposed to come with minced pork/beef.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was pretty disappointing. I'm being super generous by giving 2 stars for their xiaolongbao.

She did ask if we wanted an appetizer. \\"Can I bring you some calamari now?\\" As though we had ordered it. Rude.\\n\\nI came back later that week for a nightcap. Went to the bar, and found the bar tender chatting with someone. Not making drinks. I tried to order, but he said, \\"There's table service over there.\\" When he was clearly doing nothing. So we sat at a table, and a waitress came by maybe five minutes later. \\"It's almost closing time. What do you want?\\" We had come in at 11:30. But because of the bartender, it was closer to 11:40 when she approached. We ordered. She came back. Okay drinks. Then at 11:50 we placed another order. \\"That's last call.\\" And then basically mopped the floor around us, wiped down our table while we were sitting there. If you close at midnight, you close at midnight. Don't make people feel like they are imposing on you for being there.\\n\\nFinally, I made the mistake of coming back during a football game. The bartender served me this time, but was basically watching the football game the whole time. He only served me when I made a point of waving him down. Otherwise, his eyes were glued to the screen, and he ignored the bar. Hey, Texas is mad for football. But do your job.\\n\\nWhat is surprising is not that we had bad service. That happens, people have off nights, whatever. But the fact that it was so shockingly and consistently bad over several days--each time with different staff--that is really telling."},{"name":"Ginza Japanese Restaurant","address":"1002 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"I very happily stumbled upon this place while in the throes of a massive sushi craving at work.

We started with the spinach dip and it was quite good, salsas and flavors, warm chips and a good blend of cheese and spinach all wrapped up. Needless to say this was going to be a good night. \\n\\nNow I'll have to admit, to this day I still can't remember what I had, I think it was the prime rib....yeah, that was it, something about meat melting in your mouth and your eyes rolling into the back of your head lets you know that it's the real thing.

All of this was pretty good, though somewhat typical; the gyoza sticks in my mind as being pretty solid. The skin was nice and thin, and was fried just to a slight burn, and paired with a nice, pungent sauce. The tofu was the best of these dishes for me - really awesome, savory broth that had a touch of bacon flavor, and soft hunks of gently fried tofu.\\n\\nFor fish time, we split a crazy maki, which was a futo-style roll with shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, roe, and a mayo sauce. Again, good, but unremarkable. On the positive side, it wasn't overly riced, so didn't hit the stomach like a total depth charge as big rolls can, on the downside, no really singing flavor. We also split a sashimi deluxe, which was kind of disappointing. The tuna, salmon, and yellowtail are to be expected and were all good. Beyond that, we got whitefish, surf clam, octopus, a crab stick roll, and a mackerel roll. These were all of the take-it-or-leave-it variety.

From the moment our group walked through the door, we basked in the genuine warmth of old-fashinioned Irish hospitality. It was hard to believe that we were on Lansdowne Street and in the shadow of a Yankees/Sox game.\\n\\nAfter an all smiles welcome, we were struck by the look and feel of the Lansdowne. I mean, who ever designed this place got it spot on. The dark oak fixturing is beautiful and a pub table runs vein-like through the Lansdowne's center. It doesn't just feel authentic, it feels like the place has a soul. \\n\\nLooks aside, the Lansdowne is more than just a pretty Irish lass. Surprisingly, the food is terrific. I say surprisingly because no matter which side of the Atlantic you are on, pubs are not typically known for their food. The Lansdowne will be known as an exception to that old saw. Our group was unanimously impressed with the skillet cooked mussels. They will be on the top of my dance card when I return. My health conscious wife had plenty to pick from on the Lansdowne's menu and chose the baby spinach salad. She raved about the various textures and flavors of the salad. It gave me great comfort because I knew she would come back to a place that I clearly related to and loved.\\n\\nSince my wife had the salad, I thought that this green lighted me to try the fish and chips. Don't ask me how I came to this conclusion. After my order was placed, I picked up on a scornful look away for my seemingly unhealthy choice. Honestly, I wanted a taste of the Lansdowne's chips (fries to you) but really wanted to check out the batter on the fish. After taking my first bite, I realized how much thought went into the food. The batter was airy, delicate and melted in your mouth. The fish itself was cooked to perfection. Hell, even my wife approved after a couple of bites. The last person in our party took on the salmon dish and wiped his plate clean in glee. I think he may have mumbled \\"delicious\\" three times while devouring his meal. Regarding the desserts, we gave the fried Mars bar and the Apple Crisp a go. I'm not sure what to say about the fried Mars Bar but the apple crisp was out of this world. The fried Mars bar warranted a bite by everyone but only a bite. It wasn't that the Mars bars was bad or inedible but you just knew that it could raise the probability of heart disease.\\n\\nOur party didn't try the wine but we had plenty of the different Lansdowne's beer offerings. We had a great night at the Lansdowne Pub and cannot wait to go back. It's going to be a fun night whether the Sox are in town or not."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I am a big fan of Hawkers.

Not as much as I should have.\\n\\nLet me explain.\\n\\nWhat do you do when you get caught in the rain at a theme park with minimal food options...well, we opted to try something new. Yelp reviewers rated the Yak and Yeti a 4.5 and in truth, it was a 3.5 out of 5 for me.\\n\\nThe ambiance and decor is truly top notch. It really does look like a fixed up shack in Asia. The entryway is small and didn't accommodate all the restaurant goers and people taking shelter from the rain. Lineup to get a table was unclear, as I wasn't sure whether they were cashiers or greeters, they were primarily behind computer terminals. So, if you see what I described , head to them to get a table. You can also use the Disney my experience app to reserve a table but that requires a credit card. Wait times quoted were accurate, as we were told 25-30 minutes and we were called within that time.\\n\\nWhen we were called, we got a seat and the dining room was very spacious. However, there were empty tables waiting to be filled. So, I wonder if the wait was necessary. \\n\\nThe menu is limited and expensive, Dumplings were double the cost of anywhere else that I have eaten. So, the food was multiplied by a factor of 2. They do have a kids menu for $9, which gives the kids ample food. Both my kids ordered corn dogs and got 6-7 little corn dogs with a side and a drink. \\n\\nMy daughter also ordered a won ton noodle soup for $6, I don't mind paying the premium but what she and I were both disappointed in was the fact that it had only one singular dumpling in the soup, that is inexcusable...accurate but inexcusable (dish is called won ton (singular) soup). Lots of disappointment there. It was served with a bunch of friend crispy wonton pastries, which she didn't eat. As she was eating her soup, the rest of us were starving. I wish the restaurant would consider giving us something to munch on while we waited for our entrees. \\n\\nThankfully, soda refills are free. Our waiter was attentive but not always available when we needed him, we don't blame him as he was busy. Service was a 4.5 out of 5.\\n\\nWe also ordered a dim sum basket ($15) that had 3 pot stickers/dumplings , a couple of pork siu mai, couple of shrimp Sui mai. The Sui mai was very small. The dip had good flavour. We asked that the pork pot stickers be cooked without the rest as one person in our party was allergic to seafood but was told that they could not do that because the dish was premade.\\n\\nIn fact, most of the food had good flavour. Here's what we found:\\n\\nWe ordered a burger 54 (not really Asian), which was satisfying but salty. \\n\\nWe also had a chicken teriyaki which was quite nice, it had fried rice, teriyaki chicken, pineapple, veggies and was overall a full plate. The flavours just jumped off the dish.\\n\\nWe also had the chicken fried rice and saut√©ed baby bok Choy. \\n\\nThe chicken fried rice was not cooked properly as it was crunchy. Trying the teriyaki chicken fried rice revealed that it was also crunchy. This was returned several times without success. The waiter was very patient. I eventually had to switch to white rice which now made my meal vegetarian which was not what I wanted. \\n\\nThe bok choy had a very different flavour than I am used to but it wasn't distasteful. \\n\\nSo, the food is a 1 , consistency of food 1, innovation of flavour when they work is 4.\\n\\nWould I come back? Probably not, perhaps, I will make the trek to the rainforest cafe but the weather always threatens thunder and rain. \\n\\nThey gave us a comment card but no way to fill it out or where to place it anonymously. But it asked if the manager came by, which he didn't, which was a shame, as I would have shared my opinions then.\\n\\nBut to recap, excellent service and innovative flavours, inconsistent food and great decor. Pick what is important to you. I am glad I tried it but not for that food at that price."},{"name":"My Granny's Kitchen","address":"7800 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I came here as part of Truck by Truck West and got to try chicken and waffles as well as fried mac and cheese.\\n\\nThe chicken was tasty but the waffle was kind of soggy however I came 15 minutes before closing so that might be the problem.\\n\\nThat being said, I'm surprised they close at 10pm on a Friday night.

We live in SW Austin and have been for years searching for a place like this.  We were there on a Sunday afternoon and were just looking for a couple of drinks and an appetizer on a perfect Austin afternoon.  We sat on the patio, which is very nice.  A bar on the patio makes good service an expectation and in our case a reality.  An excellent ambience, with one small exception, that being the music played over the sound system.  More on that later.  One thing I look for first is a selection of good beers on draft.  This is 5 star for me and they only have 4 beers, but all are local beers, which is amazing for this are.  4 for 4 is stupid really.  Other bars in the area have one or two.  I congratulate Jack on this.  We only ordered one appetizer since we weren't there for dinner.  Got the red chile cheese fries.  Easily the best fries we have ever had.  We can't wait to try the rest of the menu, reads like a porn channel for the food network lovers out there.  Seriously I was sweating just reading it.

She commented on how \\"f*cking\\" cold it was outside that evening. I'm not uptight when it comes to language but I would expect a hostess not use such vulgarity upon our first meeting. It was an odd and inappropriate adverb for the situation.\\n\\nIt was nearing 9pm and perhaps that is why the crowd consisted of plenty of noisy young men who all resembled fraternity pledges: waxed eyebrows, crooked baseball caps, pre-worn denim, and apparent disregard for other restaurant patrons' dining experience as they shouted words between each other.\\n\\nThe wait staff matched the crowd. Our waiter(s), two because we had to flag someone else down to get our check, were dismissive and snobby. It felt like we were bothering them to ask for advice between two menu items. No \\"thank yous\\" from any Kell's employee all evening, either.\\n\\nOne of our party, of African descent, ordered a drink at the bar.

It is a small restaurant with all the tables very closely located to each other.  We are lucky to sit at a corner by our own right in front of the sushi bar.  We discover that there is a late night menu.  No wonder why so many people!  We order Salmon and Tuna sashimi, each for $4.95, a Salmon skin hand roll for 1.99, a Beef Udon $5.50 and a Sukiyaki.  The sashimi is fresh and each has 3 or 4 pieces.  The slice is about 1/2 inch thick, better than in Toronto.  The hand roll is a bit loosely packed and it falls apart when you try to eat it.

Chicago Freshii has their system down to a science - their quality is consistent in product, customer service, and experience.\\n\\nBoston Freshii is far from this standard, but I will continue to support this location in the hopes that they are able to work out their bugs and attain the level of dependability as the Chicago locations. These are my observations from visiting seven times thus far since December.\\n\\nFreshii is an excellent option for customizable, healthy lunches. It is also one of the few fresh juice bars (not smoothie, but juice) in the financial district, which is valuable in and of itself. I always choose the 7 Vegetable Soup because it's a giant serving of vegetable broth, crisp vegetables, and brown rice.\\n\\nThe first time I ordered this soup at this location (after it being my lunch of choice for years in Chicago), it had vegetable peels heaped in with the veggies, there was no tofu (which - in fairness - the description did not include tofu, but I hadn't noticed because I am used to it being standard from Chicago), and the broth was almost flavorless. The next time I ordered the soup, I paid extra for tofu, and the broth was slightly better, but - most egregiously - there were two pieces of chicken that had made it into the soup (I have been a vegetarian for 20+ years). The next several times of ordering, I paid extra for the tofu, and the broth and vegetable quality continued to improve (with no additional chicken scraps found, thankfully). Two visits ago, I ordered the soup, with the tofu added, but this time it seemed to cause a lot of confusion. The person assisting me said that he would replace the chicken (which is not in the description, and aside from the stray scraps, had never been in the soup) with the tofu so that I wouldn't have to pay extra. While that was appreciated, it confused and concerned me that chicken (he thought) was otherwise standard.\\n\\nThe last time I went for lunch - about a week ago - I ordered the soup again adding tofu (trying so hard...) and this time I was curtly told that tofu is already in the soup. I replied that I was happy to hear they added it as standard. The representative replied that it has always been included. I have seen this person every time I have been there the past two months, and she has charged me extra in the past for tofu. I replied \\"Great. Weird, though, because I get this literally every time I come here and have never had tofu included as standard.\\" She replied, \\"We have always made it with tofu.\\" At this point, I just paid and walked away, but her attitude was strangely rude given the context and my demeanor (which was not confrontational or otherwise anything but neutral, at worst) and evinced the confusion from the staff that I have been experiencing every time I go.\\n\\nThe point is not whether I have to pay for tofu, but instead that the staff should be well-trained in the menu and overall customer service, and providing a consistent product, and I don't think this has been fully implemented here.\\n\\nThat said - many of the other staff members are nice and efficient, and the manager is there every time I am there, and I believe he is trying to make the system better. My only other complaint is that the juices are $6.49, which is expensive, but worth a splurge every once in a while. My problem with the price, though, is that it is the same price as that charged in Chicago, but is quite small compared to the standard Chicago size. The price should either go down on these, or larger cups should be used (a matter of a few more ounces).\\n\\nSo - every visit is seemingly more annoying than it should be, and I am never totally satisfied with my experience, but I will keep giving it another chance in the hopes that it will continue to improve."},{"name":"Jovita's Mexican Restaurant","address":"1619 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"\\"Do you want a fried egg on that?\\" It's like she read my mind. \\n\\nThe food wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional either.

I was pretty excited, since Uno's has some awesome food for a decent price.  However, I was truly disappointed by the service.  It was during a busy dinner hour, so I understand that, but I can't help but wonder how difficult it is to crack a smile when on the job.  Having been in food service, I completely understand the stress of a server, but with due time in the industry, you learn how to manage the stress and become more efficient with your time.  I honestly didn't see this in our waitress.  We thought it was her first day on the job, but we then found out she had been working at the Uno's since 2013.  It sure didn't show... And let me tell you why.\\n\\nFirst of all, she completely messed up our orders.  My party asked for certain condiments and sides, but didn't get them.  There was a side of guac and french fries with my order, but I didn't ask for any of it.  When my friend didn't get her side salad with her meal, we asked our waitress and she replied with, \\"Oh, okay.\\"  No apologies, whatsoever.  It would have been more courteous that way, but she made us feel a little bit dumb.\\n\\nThen, when we asked for more waters from ANOTHER waitress because ours had been MIA for 30 minutes after we got our meals, she came around and talked to the other waitress and said in a sassy voice, \\"Oh, not enough water?\\"  We're right next to you... It's water... Why do you have to be so condescending?\\n\\nLASTLY, we split the tab three ways and she did NOT understand how to do it.  It probably took a good 10 tries for her to be able to finally put things on the correct tabs.  No apologies.  When she handed us the checks, we told her that the orders were wrong and she just said, \\"Oh, can you just subtract $3 from that one and add $3 to the other checks?\\" NOT KNOWING the other checks were wrong.  Then she just grabbed the checks and ran away.  This process took at least 15 minutes.  Sheesh!\\n\\nI give the place two stars instead of one because the food was awesome.

My theory is that they're hiding from the rest of the world, much like its patrons who wear their sunglasses (at night) indoors. \\n\\nI hear mixed reviews of the food, but they do have some vegan options here including a Sloppy Jane that looked fairly good from across the table. One gripe? No fries. Sorry, but when you've been drinking whiskey the whole night a plate of fries is pretty much required (but 5th Quadrant is within stumbling distance!)\\n\\nThere's really very little character to this bar and nothing sticks out aside from the large hipster quotient - EXCEPT for the first experience I had when ordering a drink. My friend ordered a beer and I asked for a double whiskey and ginger. The bartender told me that they \\"didn't do doubles.\\" I must have looked fairly incredulous, because she followed it up with \\"it would just be straight whiskey.\\" \\n\\nHighly doubtful, sez I, but I took her at her word and ordered a single.

The selection was fairly small and unlabeled. Not a huge problem for me, honestly, but others should know this. The waitresses seemed nice, though a man who may have been the owner was somewhat rude. Again, not a big problem for me, personally-- I kind of like restaurants with quirky owners.\\nWhat I tend to judge restaurants on most of all is, well, the food. And in this case it wasn't... especially tasty. By no means was it bad, but it just didn't have very much flavor. It was very much MILD, not spicy by any measure. One of the curries was also slightly chalky in texture. The chai I ordered, too, was flavorless and looked almost like cheap hot chocolate. The naan, the oft-delicious staple of the Indian buffet experience, was also a bit flat and flavorless.\\nWhat they DID do well, IMHO, were the samosas and pakoras. Both were nommy and I would eat more of them. From the other reviews it seems like it's a fairly different restaurant for dinners, so don't take my review to be a judgment on their dinner service or selection! But if at lunch you're looking for some good, spicy curries that leaving you wishing you had an extra stomach or three, don't come here for them. Not bad, but not especially good, either.

All I needed was to down some currywurst while jamming to World Beat with my pals Barack Obama and Jessica Alba.  I'm telling you, it was a fusion day of Mad Libs combinations that wasn't entirely unpleasant, but didn't exactly hit the mark.\\n\\nThe wife and I tried in vain to come up with somewhere, someTHING to eat that we hadn't had seemingly a million times before. Granted, earlier that day I'd just eaten a lamb, spinach, yogurt combo wrapped in a tortilla, but my wife's gluten allergy has put the wrap on wraps. After digging deep, my brain going in full Yelp mode, my iPhone augmenting reality, and my laptop searching cyberspace for a Tron-tastic find, I remembered a relatively new burger joint on Ponce. A dim memory, yes...what was it called? Some fusion place....that serves burgers...they fuse flavors together into different ground meats.....wait, it'll come to me....ah, hell. Whatever it's called, it's in the old Thai Palate space.\\n\\nWe arrived and there was one other table occupied. (On the other hand, customers in MF Sushi next door were packed in like sardines, damn cannibals.) Now I know some would enter an empty restaurant hesitantly, but me being the line hater I am, LOVES an empty restaurant. Granted, the food may be fresher where the customer turnover is better, but my patience wears thinner than Kate Moss after a coke binge. So to extend the metaphor a bit further, SCORE!\\n\\nI ordered a Malay burger with a side of fries while my wife ordered a regular cheeseburger (sans bun) with a side of sweet potato fries. The food, in short, was tasty though not exactly crave-worthy. My Malay burger tasted more Indian than anything. And yes, I understand that Malaysian and India cuisine have many commonalities, but I kept thinking with each bite, \\"This would be better named 'The Indian Burger'\\" which I guess, being a HAMBURGER, would be kind of offensive to most of India.\\n\\nSo Malay it is then.\\n\\nMy second observation was that my burger's taste really depended heavily on the whatever topping is schmeered on the meat. While the meat was juicy, had some of the flavors been incorporated into the actual patty, I think it would've been more successful. Again, with a dozen or so burger choices, I recognize why the kitchen would do this, but in this case function definitely impacts form. Also, you can say the same thing about the Vortex (and actually, I have on occasion.)\\n\\nThe fries were crunchy, battered I think. They reminded me of a higher-quality fry from Checkers (or at least a serving of Checkers fries cooked in oil that had been changed out more than once a year.) Unfortunately this also meant no fried for the wife. However, we didn't see any such batter on the sweet potato fries which she prefers anyway.\\n\\nIn all, I kind of liked this place. I didn't encounter the same service issues it seems that plagued the other Yelpers. My burger, at least, was on par with the Vortex's; my wife concurred with hers. Still, the entire \\"fusion\\" aspect didn't quite hit the mark but, as with horseshoes and hand grenades, it was close enough.\\n\\nThree and half stars rounded up to four."},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Meggan was terrific in supplying my punk @$$ with delicious brews.

First, let me say that my boyfriend and I have dined here twice before, and the food and service were wonderful.  The last time was on a Sunday (fried chicken supper club) about a month ago, and it was so delicious and our waitress was so nice, we decided to make it a monthly date night.  So we went back for the fried chicken again last night....only this time it came out very pink, even slightly bloody, and obviously undercooked. Our bartender/server had stepped away, but the hostess was nearby and noticed that something was wrong, and she very sweetly offered to take it back to the kitchen for us.  This is the first time in my life I've EVER had to send food back, and I felt bad that half a chicken had to go to waste since we had cut into it and they couldn't exactly stick it back in the fryer.  But it was their mistake, not ours, and we weren't about to risk eating undercooked chicken.  The bartender and the cook came over and gave us a very half-hearted apology and said they would send out another batch.  We were very nice and understanding and said it was no problem, we didn't mind waiting.  We weren't even upset at this point-- mistakes happen, and the hostess had been very attentive in noticing and taking care of the problem.  So we wait patiently and drink our beers until the next chicken comes out.  My boyfriend grabs two pieces and cuts into them, and they are pink and undercooked AGAIN.  We alert the bartender, again very politely, and my boyfriend laughs, \\"Is it just me, or does this still look pink?\\"  The bartender refrains from commenting and says he will go get the chef.  The chef comes out, looking annoyed, and my boyfriend shows him that the chicken is still pink, undercooked, and rubbery when trying to cut into it with a knife.  The chef doesn't apologize, just says \\"I temp checked it myself and I assure you, it's fine\\"...Awkward pause.  My boyfriend politely explains that although it may be \\"safe\\" to eat, it is still visibly undercooked and rubbery and therefore not very palatable.  (I mean, come on, there's a reason you can't order chicken medium rare...)  So after this awkward exchange, and more pressure from the chef telling us \\"it's fine\\", my boyfriend says \\"Well, I guess if you temp checked it, I'll eat it.  I'd hate for another chicken to go to waste.\\"  I asked if I could send the other 2 pieces we hadn't cut into back to be fried for a few more minutes, and they obliged.  (Those pieces came back perfectly well done and white all the way through, and not overcooked at all with those few extra minutes.)  Our lukewarm bartender knocked off two of our $4 beers and a coffee to \\"make things right\\" but the more I think back on our experience, the more upset I am.  I have to agree with the other reviewers who say this place seems to be lacking in good service-- I should NOT have left this pricey of a restaurant feeling like I was inconveniencing the chef or the bartender by TWICE (and very politely) having to send back the UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN that we paid $34 for, without receiving so much as a sincere apology.  We should NOT have felt obligated/pressured by the chef to eat the second undercooked chicken we received just so another batch wouldn't be wasted due to his own error.  When I told a friend about our experience this morning, she said she had been served undercooked chicken here before as well and was afraid to go back.  We obviously weren't the first ones to notice and complain about this issue, so I'm surprised the chef hasn't figured out to adjust the cooking time.  I don't care what the thermometer says, fully cooked chicken is NOT pink/bloody or rubbery!  I'm sorry to say that even though our first two experiences here were great, we will not be going back to Dai Due, and I will be warning everyone I know to steer clear of this place (at least on fried chicken night) and not to expect good customer service if anything is wrong with their food.  I only wish I had taken a picture of the chicken to post along with this review because it was so obviously undercooked that it was laughable how annoyed and unapologetic the chef was.  I have a feeling he didn't want to take the fall for ruining not one, but TWO $30 plates of fried chicken.  Instead, my boyfriend felt obligated to eat the second batch of undercooked chicken that he had already cut into, even though it was rubbery and he was worried about getting food poisoning.  Oh well.  I guess that's what we get for being so nice and understanding about such an unacceptable and painfully awkward experience.

I guess it's hard to get inventive with Smoked Salmon though.\\nPeppercorn Crusted Kangaroo Loin, Black Pepper Rosti, Mushroom Jus - Holy. This is the meat of the gods. As our server promised, this was a gamey version of a filet. Beautifully cooked, I only wished for more. I was a little freaked out by the fact that I was eating Roo from Winnie the Pooh though...\\n\\nOur entrees were also beautifully cooked:\\n\\nSlow Roasted Rabbit - YES. Just YES. A little stringy in consistency, but otherwise it tastes like chicken. The jus was just ok in comparison, but the mushroom ravioli was amazing. A must order. It's basically perfect in every way.\\nGrilled Duck Breast - omg. YES. Who thought you could eat duck medium rare. I was wary at first, but thanks to Google, yes, you can. It seemed deliciously evil to be eating the poultry (but red meat) rare. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the flavors were intensified by the Char Siu and forbidden rice. I never thought this Asian inspired dish would taste so un-Asian. This was probably one of the best American duck dishes I've ever tasted.\\n\\nWe were coerced into dessert, but we didn't regret it. The Chocolate Grotto reminded me of a large Ferrero Roche chocolate. The inside was creamier and richer like mousse. \\n\\nHonestly, anything you order? You can't go wrong.

Not only did one of the waiter's working there looking exactly like Lafayette from True Blood, he ended up grabbing our attention pretty early in our meals by screaming over the entire restaurant that some good friends of his (that were at his table) just got married. The girl was in her wedding dress and the guy in his suit and they stood up while Lafayette made his announcement. In the announcement, he said that this couple tried to get married 5 times in 2009 and on the last night of the year they were finally successful. This gave my boyfriend and I a lot of material throughout the rest of our dinner, and I am still wondering how does one fail one time getting married, let alone FIVE? I still cannot solve this conundrum. Honestly, I'm hoping that the couple that was in there will read this review and contact me and let me know. \\n\\nI mean, really, one time - ok, the reservation you made fell through or something.

It's more like the waiting room outside the gates. \\n\\nThe barbecue sauce certainly is about the best tasting and with the best aroma I've had. They serve it hot too, which makes a big difference. Though I don't like sweet or spicy barbecue sauce so I can only really comment fairly on the original. I did try the sweet and didn't like it but like I said I don't like sweet barbecue sauce so it's not fair to rate that. \\n\\nThey have a good variety of southern style sides. I don't know of any other place that serves southern cooking so that's a plus. This is the first time I've ever been able to try that kind of cuisine. But the mixed greens were spicy. Why would you make greens spicy? Why would you make any vegetable spicy? \\n\\nThe fries were fresh cut and perfectly delicious. They rank up there with the fries at Penn Station and 5 Guys. \\n\\nThe meats were very good but not excellent. They were a little on the dry side and they didn't have that smoked, charred tasted that barbecue is supposed to have. It just tastes like it was cooked in the oven. For it to truly be barbecue, and to have that taste that we love so much, it's really got to be cooked on a barbecue. This place calls itself barbecue but there's no fire involved at all as far as I can tell. Isn't that a bit like a place calling itself an ice cream shop and then only serving popsicles? \\n\\nAnother thing I don't like about this place is the way they serve the food. They put your sides on the tray and leave it sitting there on the counter while they take 10-15 minutes to get your \\"barbecued\\" meat out of the oven and cut it fresh. So by the time you get your food, the sides have gone cold. Then you have two choices: eat the meat first and let the sides get even more cold, or eat the cold sides first and let the meat get equally as cold. \\n\\nWhen I was ordering, the server gave me samples of the different kinds of meat. They were delicious, though still not really barbecued. But when I got my food, it was nothing like the samples. The meat was dry and lukewarm. The samples were fresh and juicy. Is that just a coincidence? \\n\\nI went to a Yelp Elite event at another City Barbecue location last year. I had pulled pork and some ribs. The meats were delicious, smokey and charred the way they should be. Why is this one not serving the same quality food? \\n\\nI will go back to this place, but I am disappointed and underwhelmed.

We absolutely enjoyed the unique experience, the excellent service of the crew, and the decent meal accompaniments on board. However, I completely realize that to really enjoy this, you really have to go with the right people and have the right expectations in mind.\\n\\nFirst off - You should come here to enjoy the food, but NOT FOR THE FOOD. The food here is decent to good (the best were the deserts). They make a HUGE effort on presentation and making it look nice, but the reality is that some the chicken and fish is a little bit dry, but at least everything is decently seasoned and well cooked. Essentially, it is standard applebees quality (circa early 2000s before they got super fancy). And yes, the drinks are SUPER expensive - like 7 dollars a mixed drink, but then again it isn't that bad for a boat.\\n\\nThe performances are fun if you come not to be \\"wowed\\" by the flare of the performances or to have a \\"concert experience\\". Yes some of the songs are kinda cheesy like from a 90's wedding. But, the fun isn't the song selection, but it is watching the crew (who are servers and singers) SING their heart out and always put up a smile and dance across the boat - and put on a show. Of course watching the grandmas and little kids on the dance floor is kinda funny.\\n\\nWe came for the scenic views, and on a sunny day in Boston, you can't beat this boat. I took the traditional Boston boat cruise before (the just boat and drinks one), and by comparison this was rather luxurious with plenty of room, classy drink options, and seating space. It also seemed like it went much further and longer than the other boat cruise.\\n\\nMy lasting memory of this other than enjoying an afternoon with my sister was how the staff was always super attentive, super friendly, and when they could (AKA: the manager let them), they gave a drink or two on the house."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The manmosa was amazing!!!!!! Came here for brunch with friends. We came early before opening and waited about 15 min before the doors opened. Got seated right away. And if you are there early on Sunday you have to order food and your drink at the same time. Had the eggs benedict. Eggs were cooked perfectly,the string hash potatoes were okay but the event is so unique and fun, I couldn't help but love it. I split the manmosa with a friend. Also, they have a live band play the entire time and it was really fun listening to them jam.
