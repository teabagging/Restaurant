The crab cake was well seasoned and filled with crab instead of bunch of fillers. We had Island Creek oysters, which were perfection. So the lobster roll, it was one of the best I've ever had.

Although the pasta was a tad overcooked, the chilli and tomato sauce was tasty yet not too overpowering. The lobster was freshly killed and cooked, giving some deliciously succulent flesh. The rest of the seafood - mussels, clams and calamari - was fresh and done all right, but nothing particularly rave-worthy. The dish stood out as being a classier take on a homecooked dish. However, for the price of 78 dollars a pan, I thought it was not value for money. \\n\\nMonkfish Marsalla: We had this with squid ink pasta. The pasta had a texture like undercooked udon and was not particularly delicious. What saved the dish was the grilled monkfish fillet that was perfectly cooked, moist and lightly crisped on the outside, smothered by the smooth and sweet marsala wine sauce. This gave the best value at 25 dollars a pan.\\n\\nSpaghetti Aglio Alio (24 dollars a pan): We had this with prawns and scallops and sauteed broccoli. The seafood was properly cooked i.e. not overcooked/undercooked, but lacked natural sweetness and umami. The white wine left a hint of astringency on the tongue while the copious amounts of olive oil and garlic masked most of the flavours of the ingredients and gave an unpleasantly greasy aftertaste. \\n\\nOther things to note:\\n- Our first basket of bread came cold and we only got warm bread on the second round.\\n- With only 20 seats, it gets cramped.

I had the appetizer portion of the Aglio Olio: squid ink pasta with shredded squid and my friend had the Calamari Linguine with red sauce. Both were delicious, had perfectly cooked pasta and just the right amount of sauce to coat the pasta! The squid ink pasta is definitely my go to every time I come here, although I find the amount of squid to vary each time I come. Last night was no disappointment though, there was squid in every bite! My favorite part of this place is that they serve the pasta in the pan it's cooked in! Call me odd, but I like the rustic-ness of it :) Also, they serve good wine in plastic cups filled to the rim. \\n\\nIf you're questioning this place don't.

In fact, Island Creek Oyster Bar surpasses its competitors in certain areas (definitely in choices on the menu and drinks available).  The restaurant has a casual classy ambience that make it a great place to hangout, get some drinks, or go on a fancy date.  The bar is glorious and a wonderful place, filled with great cocktails and also a display of the daily's catch of oysters.  The seafood is incredibly well seasoned and fresh, and all the items on the menu are delicious and savory.  The assortment of oysters is vast and the flavors diverse, pungent, subtle, briney, sweet, and tender.  The staff is extroadinarily kind and put all they effort to make your experience incredible.  In fact, I was there to celebrate my brother's birthday and they overheard he loved cookies & cream ice cream.  For the dessert, they made him a cookies & ice cream cake from scratch, definitely off menu (they told someone to run to Star Market to buy oreos).  Definitely recommend the Crispy Oyster Slider, the Lobster Roll, the Lobster Roll Noodles, the Monkfish, the Honey buttermilk biscuit, the Fries (they are seriously good), and the Banoffee pie.

Too bad, this $15, \\"Black Angus Burger\\" sounds fine, available at the bar only, in what is a well respected establishment. But, as is often the case with well respected establishments and their burgers, not much thought is put into it, yet the price tag is advanced based on location and reputation of adjoining dishes on the menu. Everyone wants to serve a burger, I get it, but where's the love? We all want to join the Boston burger party but no one wants to be prepared. Maybe I'm taking this a bit too seriously, but then again, that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who knows me or this blog. I'm serious about my burgers, maybe I should learn to lighten up. Then again maybe I'll lighten up for the next one.\\n\\nIt's not a bad burger by any stretch, but a cliched example of the price killing any glimmer of respectability. You're paying for ambiance in a lovely restaurant, and location. What ever happened to paying for the product? It's more or less a $9 burger overcharged by about $6. Tasting like a pretty standard beef blend (chuck or sirloin most likely) it has modest seasoning and minimal beef flavor. The requested medium-rare is mostly honored, over-cooked around the edges but a rosy pink on the interior, it's neither overly juicy or completely dry. The fries, promised to be seasoned with Espelette Pepper, a common spice used by many pretentious chefs (kidding of course, it's wonderful) does nothing to live up to its mild heat and aroma teaser. Pale and less than optimal in the crunch factor, they are bland and devoid of pairing with most burgers, let alone a $15 one.\\n\\nGoat Cheese is an uncommon option to top a burger and one we couldn't pass up. It would have worked better had the beef flavor been more predominant, but instead it's all cheese and no beef. Ideally, the sharpness of the goat cheese would have paired beautifully with the salty and rich beef. Maybe in my perfect burger world, but this isn't it. The bun, in the much maligned Brioche neighborhood, is too large to work with the burger, and the addition of iceberg lettuce and raw red onion give it a Pub style feel I had hoped they'd want to avoid.

I guess the avocado oil mixed in gives it that \\"fried\\" quality when flash cooked in their ultra hot ovens. The toppings are not laid on too thick, so the pizzas are light and easy to eat. I think pretty much anyone could handle a whole one. I split the old bay lump crab pizza and the luau. The crab was pretty good, not overcooked like most seafood on pizzas tends to be. The lemon wedge it was served with really came in handy. Overall just good. The Luau, on the other hand, stole the show with big chunks of fresh pineapple and really delicious bbq pulled pork. Really excellent. I'll be craving another tomorrow.\\n\\nOn the downside, the cookie I got for dessert was kinda crappy (underbaked, low quality chocolate, not enough salt) and some of the pizzas had a little too much crust showing. I understand a pizza can show a little more crust than most but when the toppings end halfway from center to edge, come on. The only saving grace is that the crust was decent to eat on its own. Lastly, the crust hardened and got a little unpleasant about 30 minutes after being served, the same way fried dough does. I dunno if I'd recommend taking home leftovers. This style of pizza is best quickly enjoyed while fresh and is unlikely to reheat well. \\n\\nDelicious pizza and fast service.

How often do you expect to hear there's a great, upscale restaurant is in a Kroger shopping center?  \\nSo the wifey and I recently move less than 5 minutes from C&S. And we'd driven by dozens of times, without too much thought.  Until one of her coworkers recommended it.  So tonight, a random Thurs night, we felt like going out to eat, and she suggested C&S and off we went. \\n\\nFirst off, the place is pretty nice. Not stuffy, pretentious nice, but \\"wouldn't be out of place to take someone for a very special meal\\" nice.  The details:\\n-Shrimp and Goat Cheese Beignets - in retrospect, I realize the shrimp was not even noticeable, however, these things were light, fluffy bites of deliciousness. Not at all what I expected. \\n-Grilled oysters - I could've eaten several more plates of these. Outstanding.\\n-Flounder entree - first off, flounder is not something I would generally order, but the server highly recommended it. And rightfully so. As my wife described it, it's light and creamy, with the perfect amount of parmesan. But wait, there's more...the spinach it's served on, while simple, was perfect. If I had to pick a nit, I'd say it was light on the crab, but I can overlook that because it was fantastic.\\n-Tuna Entree - also delicious, with a very nice arugula salad. \\n\\nService was good - a bit stiff and rushed at times, but overall he was on top of things and made good recommendations. \\n\\nAs an avid foodie, I'm trying to figure out how this place was never on my radar before??

It's rather a tight squeeze in there.\\n\\nFood: Wow, it's really amazing.  They're famous for their wings - so flavorful, tender on the inside, crispy on the outside - not over cooked, but a tad on the salty side.  You've got to like the flavor of fish sauce though.  Pork skewers were also very good, liked the peanut sauce and pickled veggies that went with it - the flavors all mix deliciously in your mouth.  Also got the sweet pork belly curry - again, the flavor was complex and amazing.\\n\\nPrices: Most dishes in $15-$17 range, kinda on the expensive side, but well worth it.\\n\\nSo you might ask why only 4 stars.  Well, during the meal I asked my son if he wanted to drink some water since the food was a little salty.  He said no.  I urged him to drink when he leaned in and whispered that the cups were dirty and I said \\"Huh?\\".  He explained that he saw a waiter bring back a dirty cup and dump out the water and put it on another table.  (We were sitting by the bathrooms which was across from where they were doing some of those things so he could have seen that.)  I asked him if he was sure and he nodded his head.  I put down the cup I was drinking from and made a quick mental assessment - cooking the food kills the germs - they must have to wash the dishes to serve the food on because food sticks.  And so I continued eating and waiting until I got back to the car to drink some water.\\n\\nSecond is a small thing, but was sort of annoying.  I ordered curry to go, it came in a paper to go box.

Note that they do not take reservations for the patio seating at the downstairs bar area. I showed up around 5:45 to make sure we were able to get a table and was plesantly surprised when I saw several nice options available. We were seated right next to the edge of the patio and had a nice view partially overlooking the swan boats on the Boston Common. The food was excellent. I had the angus burger, with gruyere. The burger comes with a generous side of spicy fries. My friend had the salmon with a side of fries. I love how they bring a whole tray of condiments with the burger including ketchup, onions and mayo in cute, individual bowls. The brioche roll of my burger was amazing and it was cooked to my specification. I also loved that the fries were served piping hot and fresh. We had perfect weather for patio seating, were not bothered by the sun and even though we were seated close to other patrons, there was enough background nosie so that we weren't overwhelmed by other people's conversations. \\n\\nHowever, I have a few bones to pick with Bistrot du Midi. \\nFirstly, I was overcharged for my wine. It was $10 on the menu but I was charged $12. I wasn't going to make a big deal, but seriously. Not right. Secondly, after we had finished our meal and were lingering over our coffee, an employee  (I am assuming the manager) asked us to move from our table to a high-top closer to the bar so that they could seat a party of 4 on the patio by combining our table with the table of a couple who'd just left. Now, I realize that we were basically done and were just lingering, but I found this rather off-putting. The employee was nice about it and got us new waters for our new location, but it definitely put a damper on the whole experience. Also, I found the service less than stellar. The waiter said he'd get a spoon for my friend's coffee, but never came back with one, so she had to use her cocktail stick to stir her coffee. Also, while other people had breadsticks in their bread baskets, we got only bread.

A little bit of the meatpacking district transported to Fenway, the decor is surely a standout in this town, which is inundated with establishments suffering from the pitiful affliction of the drop ceiling.  Not surprisingly the prices are in line with the surroundings, but happily so is the quality of the seafood.\\n    The place is owned by the venerable and mega successful Oyster farming outfit of the same name based down the shore in Duxbury MA.  Their oysters are found up and down the coast including many kitchens, high and middle end both, in NYC.  They, of course, are offered here, along with a wide selection of other strains, with an especially heavy tilt towards New England varieties.  Be prepared to pay upwards of 3 bucks a bivalve but they are really really good.  Beyond the raw bar, the obvious must order here is the much hyped and insanely rich signature dish of Lobster Roe Noodles.  Said noodles, infused with maybe just the right slight amount of roe flavor, are mixed with big chunks of fresh lobster and slow cooked beef short rib.  Its as gimmicky and delicious as it sounds.  Clam chowder (thin), lobster rolls and the other standards are excellent as well, although, again not quite as good as B&G's, and possible not Neptune's either.  Another hyped dish, the oyster sliders appetizers were among my least favorite of the offerings I've had here, the breading coating them too oddly similar to fish sticks I had thankfully relegated to my 80s childhood memories.\\n        The sleek bar is tended by some quality bartenders and is the only way to go here if you ask me.

I was extremely disappointed in the show.  \\n\\nThe food - It was eatable, but lacked something.  The soup was more like chicken water with three paper thin scallions and a sliver of an eggy thing floating in it.  The salad was even worst.  The lettuce was old and beginning to rot.  However, I didn't noticed it because it was swimming in some non-descript white salad dressing.  The steak and seafood was cooked well except there was an inordinate amount of sauce or sauces used to masked the natural flavors of the food.\\n\\nThankfully, it came with a spoon full of commercially purchased vanilla flavored ice cream.

We started with a dozen island creeks - they were the best of the best, as far as I'm concerned.  Then I ordered the PEI mussels out of the shell prepared with \\"white wine cream, garlic, shallots, parsley.\\"  They were indeed out of the shell, but they were mixed in with a bowl of Israeli cous cous (not mentioned on the menu)  sitting in a pool of what tasted and looked to be just cream.  There was no hint of the promised garlic or shallots.  In fact, there was no trace of any seasoning at all.  I doctored them up with lemon, salt and pepper and they were fine.  Someone else got the \\"Crispy Rhode Island Calamari shaved fennel, kalamata olive, piquillo pepper\\" which was just okay.  The calamari was a bit overdone and the RI style portion of the dish was not there - the piquillo pepper was a sauce.  Again, fine, but not good.  Our third dinner companion ordered the fish sandwich, which he was pleased with.

(I also have a few other dietary preferences/restrictions). I have found almost everything at Life Alive to be a great option! It is vegetarian paradise. Their food is very fresh and they are creative with their ingredients and names (The Feisty Child... how cute is that!) You can also substitute ingredients. (I sometimes add carrots to mine.) \\n\\nTheir smoothies, although a little overpriced in my opinion, are also great! I have tried the Lust Alive and the Island Alive. The Island Alive is a little too sweet for my taste (I am not big on sugary drinks). The Lust Alive has little too much cinnamon but it's an excellent ginger drink. Speaking on ginger drinks, their Ginger Crush is also awesome!\\n\\nOverall, I give this place 5/5 since they have good, fresh, vegetarian food, which is hard to find! It also has a great vibe and works as a lunch/snack/dinner/first date/100th date/family gathering/casual meet up/you name it! \\n\\nThe only complaints I have are that they don't take reservations and that they have too few locations.

Only have 5 minutes to get there or it's given away. OK, I understand the need for speed, but both restaurants are owned by the same person/people, so they're making $ either way. Why not let you finish your food and drinks in a little more time, even 10 minutes would work.  We passed on the 1st table, and started to order another round of drinks when the waitress came back and said ANOTHER table was up. We quickly cancelled the 2nd round of drinks and took the table.

You could get chicken, steak or a combo or each. The price is the same whichever you choose. I really liked that!  The meat was brought to the table in a sizzling skillet, served on a bed of onions, red and green peppers! It was pretty good and had a nice kick to it! It comes with the works: lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. THE FRESH MADE FLOUR TORTILLAS WERE SOOOOOOOOO GOOD! I was literally just eating them alone.

Like Little Red Bike Cafe (LRBC) this is MY kind of place. \\n\\nNick and Sarah have done an amazing job shaping this breakfast nook into what it is today. Rebuilding center smartly used decor. Cozy limited seating. Chill patio out back. Fun midweek specials (Cheesburger Tuesdays, Cuban Wednesdays, Cheesesteak Thursdays). Well thought out menu. Homemade ketchup and jam. Delicious sweet potato biscuits and gravy. The best coffeecake I've ever had (and I've eaten a lot of coffeecake).  Wonderful helpful servers with a great sense of humor. \\n\\nWhile I grew up in the southern most state I wouldn't really say I'm from the South. Still, I like some Biscuits n' Gravy.  Here I think the portioning was just right, not too huge, some nicely sliced pork, and a generous amount of rosemary sausage gravy.  While I liked the seasoning of the library fries I thought they could be a little crisper on the outside and softer inside. \\n\\nAnd while I went to school on the East Coast I hadn't quite made it to Philly. Still, I like to think I can recognize a good cheesesteak when I eat one. With Nick hailing from the city with the cracked bell, this time honored favorite is the real deal here. Chopped up high quality Painted Hills round steak, griddle fried onions, Cheeze Wiz (for those who want it Philadelphia style other options available). The roll it came in had that ideal soft, slightly but not too chewy texture. Put all together it's a simple, straight forward, nothing fancy delight. If you want one, go early (on a Thursday) before they're 86'd. \\n\\nSome thoughts if you plan to eat here:\\n1. Small places with great food, are still small. So if you go on the weekend or during the lunch rush expect to wait. Bring a book. Meet new people.\\n\\n2.  Just because you wait, have reasonable expectations. I think it's silly when people expect something earth shattering just because they sat around for an hour. People who don't have the patience should plan to eat earlier or on a weekday. \\n\\n3. Enjoy the complete experience of the place. The casual feel. The funktified jazz mix. The friendly servers. The whole community aspect. The homemade comfort food.  \\n\\n4. Understand that it's a neighborhood place and that you're a visitor (assuming you don't live in Mt. Scott). Don't complain if you found it hard to find or had to drive far, its not their fault. \\n\\n5.  Eat the Coffeecake. So far I've had it with apples (divine) and bananas (delicious). Moist cake portion, and topping with enough crunch without being burnt or caramelized. \\n\\nI can't wait to return again (I've gone twice in the last two weeks) for the Sicilian Hash (weekend brunch), another Philly, chocolate chip cookies, and everything else. \\n\\nI can't yelp about what other people would like, but places like the ALBC and the LRBC are what I like.

Aside from a few clams that you don't often see (cockle, whelk), the big attraction has to be the presence of uni.  I suppose they do charge enough money to offer all you can eat uni--and it's good quality.  I think the same kind that comes in a whole box that most restaurants use.  I must have had about 12 of these altogether, yum.  \\n\\nThere's a small robata section, from which my favorites items were the ribeye and calamari.   There's a tiny soup section that also serves udon (the noodle is cooked as you order), it was just decent.  From the cold food section I enjoyed  a variety of marinated fish, shellfish.  There's a whole plate of mackerel, great.  I also had about 2 dozens of raw oysters, again pretty fresh.  Unfortunately there's no king crab or lobster, just snow crab and it's not that great quality.\\n\\nTo round out the offering there's a couple of dim sum choices in the hot  food section, tempura, and stuffed shellfish.  Not many dishes worth eating there.  The shrimp shumai wasn't bad though.

I will forever lament the day that my metabolism slowed down and I could no longer afford to eat pizza every single day.  But, Oath Craft is not pizza.\\n\\nI came here last week with a friend.  The interior is very crisp and clean, although it seems like there is a lot of unused space in here as seating is pretty limited.  There are a few tables, booths, and one long table in the middle.  We were both incredibly confused at where to order.  You walk in the front door, then have to walk to the opposite side of the restaurant to order.  Why not put the register/ordering right in the front?  We also thought this might be more like a Chipotle-style place where you choose ingredients as you go down the line but alas, it's not.  And we were lost.\\n\\nOnce we sorted that out, we both ordered our pizzas.  At $11 for an averagely sized personal pizza, this place is no bargain, but a good pizza is worth the money (spoiler: it wasn't).  The cashier was extremely friendly though -- service is definitely the high point of Oath Craft.  \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes later, someone came out to where we were sitting with our pizzas.  That system is a little confusing.  They walk around saying your name until they find you, and we saw more than one occasion where the server couldn't find the customer.  \\n\\nAt first glance, the topping to crust ratio is way off here.  There's like a solid 2-3 inches of crust around the outside with very, very minimal toppings.  Crust is awesome, don't get me wrong.  but this crust is also pretty awful so there's that.  The toppings were fine, nothing to write home about, but neither of us took any issue with those.  The crust is just plain bad.  It's incredibly oily (why??) and has a strange texture.  It tastes kind of like cardboard.  I know they say it's formulated so it cooks quickly, but other places with a similar model (Blaze, for one) don't have that issue.  \\n\\nWould I come back?

Kacey's it is.\\n\\nThe sign on the street touts two very distinct selling points.  First, it suggests that Kacey's has the best fried chicken in town (it doesn't), and secondly, every day your meal will be the same price - seven bucks.  This really should have been our warning sign.  We stopped in under the mistaken assumption that it was a meat-and-three, but no, it was a buffet.  At this point, though, we were so hungry that we decided to stick it out.  Maybe the place was actually good!\\n\\nThe decor and layout of this place was amazing.  Imagine if they put a Golden Corral inside a strip club from the 1980s.  This place seriously looks like Crockett and Tubbs are going to bust in at any moment and clean house - every vertical surface in the place is mirrored.  It's Scarface's All You Can Eat Buffet.  Everything was clean, at least, and most of the food looked pretty inviting.\\n\\nI did a once 'round the hot bar and came back with a plate full of fried chicken, BBQ chicken, BBQ ribs, mashed potatoes, lima beans, candied yams and yeast rolls.  The fried chicken was reasonably good - the meat was fairly juicy, even if the breading was really nothing to write home about.  The BBQ chicken was similar - sufficiently moist meat with a fairly bland sauce.  Ribs were kind of gross, spongy and stringy at the same time.\\n\\nAll of the veggies were acceptable at best.  Nothing seemed to have any seasoning on it - the lima beans were actually pretty good once I hosed them down with salt and pepper, and the candied yams were decent, if a bit sickly-sweet.  The yeast roll was above average.\\n\\nThe desserts looked promising, but were a letdown.  The cakes were from Sysco or similar.  The peach cobbler and banana pudding were both reasonable, but could have been a lot better.  The cobbler was mostly runny syrup, with a thin and crumbly layer of crust on top and peaches sparsely distributed throughout.  The pudding was very thin, again mostly runny gunk with the occasional banana chunk or vanilla wafer to give things texture.\\n\\nTo add insult to insult to injury, our server refilled our drinks exactly once, topping off our diet cokes with fresh sweet tea.  No, seriously.  If you've never had diet coke and sweet tea before, I can safely tell you to NEVER DO SO.

The shop itself was quite small and has many bubble tea options displayed on the four TV screens hung above the counter and they seemed to get a ton of traffic and filled up pretty quickly. \\n\\nVivi Bubble Tea offers a bubble tea adventure with an extensive menu of flavored teas, milk teas, slush drinks, ice jelly teas, and Yakult drinks. Flavored teas range from kumquat lemon to green apple. Milk teas include coconut milk tea, Japanese matcha, chocolate milk tea and more. Ice jelly teas are teas topped with jelly made from fruit pulp. Yakult drinks are fermented milk drinks containing a probiotic known to help improve the immune system. Most Vivi Bubble Tea drinks are served with signature bobas, or tiny orbs of flavor.\\n\\nWhat's cool about Vivi's is the personalization of your order...from amount of sugar, ice, tapioca, jelly, etc. Sort of like the Starbucks of bubble tea.

It had a whole lobster, mussels, huge clams, shrimp, and linguine in a tomato-based sauce.  This sauce is usually spicy but it only had a hint of spiciness here.  Everything blended so well together, the juices from the seafood running into the fra diavolo, and served in its hot cooking pan.\\n\\nWe also had the homemade squid ink pasta with AGLIO OLIO (garlic oil). The texture of the pasta was so chewy and delicious.  It was topped with garlic, olive oil, and tons of calamari bits.  We finished the pasta but kept going on the topping.  I haven't been to Italy, but this was one of the top homemade pastas I've ever had."},{"name":"Meson Sandwiches","address":"6622 Eagle Watch Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I believe this is one of the first days days that this restaurant is open.

DON'T waste your time or money eating here.\\n\\nThis place came highly recommended. My girlfriends and I get together for dinner quite frequently. Someone suggested our favorite spot, UMI (their food and service are amazing), but I suggested that we try something different. Bad mistake. I called MF (we now know what MF stands for, but I'll keep the vulgarity out of my post) to make a reservation.  We were told we couldn't come at the time we wanted because they wanted to provide \\"good service.\\" Well they should have told us not to come at all.  Upon our arrival, there was no one at the door to greet us. We looked past that because we were busy admiring decor and ambiance.  We were now very excited to taste the food and to have an experience that was going to match this beautiful place.  Someone finally came over after we stood there for about 10 min waiting. \\n\\nAfter getting settled in, one of the managers brought us menus and waters and then proceeded to tell us that they don't have a liquor license!! Shouldn't that have been stated over the phone? She said we can walk across the street and go buy some wine if we want.  That was the first blow to our experience.  However, she was kind enough to bring over complimentary calamari because she could tell we were not happy about this. \\n\\nAfter ordering from the extremely large and overwhelming menu, we took a stroll to get some wine.  One of us waited behind, because we figured our salads and soups would arrive fairly quickly. Boy were wrong. When we got back, there was no food on the table. The same manager from earlier came by to bring us wine glasses. We told her we only needed three because one of us was pregnant. She then proceeds to tell us that she doesn't have kids because she's too old but doesn't look her age because she ages like, \\"You black women.\\"  Although she meant for this to be a compliment, it was very unprofessional and way too\\nfamiliar. \\n\\nThirty minutes had passed since we ordered. Our miso soups finally came, which weren't that impressive, and then after about another 20 minutes my friend finally got her octopus salad. Our sushi rolls arrived another 20 min later. Wait. It takes over an hour to roll sushi?!? Not to mention there only about five parties in the entire restaurant so it wasn't even busy.  Finally our rolls come at all different times, and they are all wrong. What are these people doing??? We flag over the waiter, who was obviously hiding from us because he knew the food was wrong, to let him know of the error. I kept my roll because I was starving, but my friend sent hers back and asked for what she ordered.\\n\\nI could go on and on about the entire horrible experience, but I'll cut to the worst part. After speaking to someone about how terrible everything was, we were told that two of our rolls would be comped. When we received the bill, the rolls were still on there. We told the waiter that someone said they were taking them off. The manager then comes over to ask us WHY they should take it off? Duh, because YOU guys offered to do so. He snatches the check from us and then sends over the other manager we had from earlier. She is now at this point, obviously drunk, because she was drinking with the party beside us, and she begins to yell at us about how we ate the rolls so she shouldn't have to comp it. During this argument she said she is going to comp the whole bill, but she wants to give us her point first. When we disagreed with her point, she then said, \\"I was going to comp it, but I'm now not going to comp shit.\\" Who talks like that to paying customers?!?! We weren't loud, we never cursed at her, and we NEVER asked for them to do anything for us. They offered from the beginning, as they should have. \\n\\nAt that point we weren't going to sit there while someone was yelling and cursing at us. We put our credit cards back in our wallets and left. I have NEVER skipped out on a bill, but that whole situation was egregious. We were now fearing for our safety and just wanted to get out. As we get into our vehicle, several of the employees follow us and throw racial slurs and called us bitches while we were driving away. \\n\\nThis was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had. For a moment I thought I was on an episode of Punked. I was waiting for the camera crew to come out! Don't eat here- EVER.  If you like waiting hours for your food, being cursed at, and practically run down in the parking lot, this place is for you!

Papa Ginos consistently comes back as the best pizza I have encountered.  The dough is crunchy and has flavor, the cheese is tangy and the sauce is the best pizza sauce I have had.  The subs are also superb, delicious bread and the best steak and cheese subs I have ever had.  I know these are broad statements, but I love the Papa.   Part of moving back to Boston was to get back to Papa Ginos.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day. this is a fast food joint.

Their shrimp won ton soup was one of the best I've ever tasted (I live in Los Angeles and am always on a quest to find the best won ton soup). Although the won ton soup is plain except for some scallions (no veggies or meat), the broth is tasty and the won tons were the right size and texture. Dip some in the chili paste and I'm in heaven!\\n\\nI also ordered their roast duck, marinated chicken and BBQ pork. It was all delicious with meaty pieces of duck and chicken (on the bone). The marinade flavor was very authentic Chinese. We also tried their sweet and sour shrimp and house special chicken (cut up pieces of chicken on the bone covered with a warm ginger and scallion sauce). Both dishes were well prepared and delicious! You'll be served steam rice with the meal.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and efficient which is rare for a Chinese restaurant.

Everyone at my table had an extremely tough decision to make. Luckily, our waiter was extremely helpful in describing each dish, making recommendations, and helping guide the decision making process. \\n\\nWe all started with the Bibb Lettuce Salad. The honey crisp apples and blue cheese was the perfect pairing. It's a wonderful salad.\\n\\nOur table then shared the sausage appetizer and tuna tartar- both were perfect to share for 4 people. I thought the tartar could have used a crispy garnish of some kind, but the flavor and texture was perfect. And the sausage was filled with savory flavors balanced perfectly by the raisins. A very innovative dish.\\n\\nI decided on the Chitarra pasta for my main. I can never turn down a good seafood pasta and this did not disappoint. The pasta itself was infused with black pepper, and it was served with mussels (no shells), calamari, and sea urchin. Perfect balance of seafood flavor but not overly done. \\n\\nI tasted my dad's duck as well and was blown away. He said it was the best duck he ever had, and I can understand why.\\n\\nWe all shared one chocolate souffl√© for dessert. Usually I find chocolate souffl√© to be too rich but maybe I haven't had it done right before, because this was phenomenal. Fluffy and perfect. They also brought a cheese plate with dessert for my birthday which went perfectly with the wine and souffl√©. \\n\\nIt's a very open room and the acoustics aren't great, so it is very loud in there.

This last time was worth commenting upon.  Located in Kenmore Sq., Island Creek is pretty simple to get to by T and if you find street parking or want to valet, not hard by car.  Always extremely busy, it's a good idea to grab a reservation before heading over.  The staff are friendly and courteous.  The ambiance is modern, fun, and bustling.\\n\\nThe oyster selection is terrific. You will find varieties from all along the east coast as well as from our neighbors up north and out west.  Island Creek gives you big oysters.  You will get your money's worth.  The cocktail sauce and mignionette are very good.  My only slight complaint is that the oyster shucking can be a bit sloppy at times with pieces of shell mixed in with the oyster.  To contrast, you won't encounter this very often at a place like B&G Oysters.\\n\\nFor dinner, my wife had the halibut with pea and mushroom risotto.  It was perfectly cooked, still flaky.  A big portion of fish, it was delicious and we accompanied by the savory risotto.  I had the lobster roll to switch things up.  It was terrific.  On a great buttery roll.  The lobster meat was seasoned with finely diced onions, pickles, and mayo.  The lobster serving could have been more generous for the price but then again we just got back from Maine and are a bit spoiled!  In the past, I have ordered the lobster roe pasta which is as good if not better than all of the reviews singing its praise.  Comparatively, I still give B&G the edge but this is a great second option for oysters.  I would weigh Island Creek as slightly better than Oceanaire though.\\n\\nOverall, Island Creek Oyster Bar is excellent.

They take down one of the ones hanging in the front window and slice it up into manageable bite size portions.  Served with a thick tasty sauce, green onions, and the typical Momofuku style steamed buns.  These are the same buns you would buy at MT Supermarket / what you would get at East Side Kings, and they are seriously addictive.

Both times, they said they were out of the homemade fusilli. Did I miss something in that half hour? It wasn't crowded when I got there either time. Is there a secret handshake? Code word? knock knock joke? Pasta Ponzi? I have their menu and it definitely says homemade fusilli and doesn't say it isn't served early. I ended up going with the mass produced penne that is overcooked like any other standard pasta place in the area. Restaurants pay extra attention to homemade pasta because it cooks so quickly and has to be cooked to order. Thats why I order it!! You guys are better than this. The other time there was no fusilli, I went with the linguine aglie olio and was cooked to perfection, al dente!.

Plus the Avalon Theatre Arcade is just a few blocks down. And it didn't hurt that my friends woke up early to put our name on the list and came back to pick up the rest of us =).\\n\\n~~COST~~\\nCheap! For a drink and a pancake with plenty of toppings, it was only about $20 total per person. \\n\\n~~AMBIANCE~~\\nLots of hustle & bustle, not quite as much of the homey/quirky feel of a lot of places in Portland, but this still had a warm and friendly feel to the place. \\n\\n~~SERVICE~~\\nExcellent! As busy as it was at Slappy Cakes, I found our server to be incredibly cheerful, helpful, and always present/easy to flag down. The wooden beams make you feel like you're in a warm cabin that welcomes you with warm food and happy smiles.\\n\\n~~SOME TIPS IF YOU'RE MAKING PANCAKES~~\\n- Follow your server's advice! I.e., the edge of the griddle is cooler and will take longer to cook the pancakes through, when you put toppings in the batter push them in a little (otherwise when you flip, the toppings will just burn, or melt if it's a cheese).\\n- Got this from an experienced friend: add a dab of batter over the toppings!\\n- Some toppings require extra manipulation - I got apples, which came in really thick chunks, and I found when I sliced them thinner they were much easier to handle in the pancakes.\\n- All toppings are shared! This is probably really obvious to most people, but for some reason I thought the toppings would come mixed into each person's batter. Instead, you get little bowls of each topping and you can always swap/share with everyone at your table.\\n\\nbatter makes for very smooth & good pancakes\\n\\n~~SPECIALTY DRINKS~~\\n* Whiskey for breakfast - 5 stars\\n(pendelton whiskey, fresh lemon juice, maple syrup & egg white. $8)\\nSounds a little excessive for 11am, but this was tasty as heck and the alcohol flavor wasn't overwhelming at all. Everyone loved this drink and my friend got a 2nd order during the meal. It comes with two blueberries on a stick - delicious!\\n\\n* Pumpkin Nog - 3 stars\\n(spiced rum w/ ginger syrup, steamed milk, and pumpkin puree. $7.50)\\nI was really excited about this as all the ingredients (pumpkin & ginger - two of my favorite things)! However, it was a lot stronger (alcohol-wise) than I expected and I wish the pumpkin flavor was more dominant. I did like the fresh pumpkin chunks in the drink.\\n\\n~~BENEDICTS~~\\n* Pork belly benedict - 3.5 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slappy-cakes-portland?select=I0F3wwipCvKahqdz-Kd6tA#O76IE2d8md1y0NZMYnnuHQ\\n(pork belly confit w/ cider marinated coleslaw, topped w/ two poached eggs & a bacon fat hollandaise. $12)\\nThe pork belly was fatty and tender, the biscuit soft & buttery, and the poached eggs had a nice runny yolk. The potatoes were a little bland and didn't have enough crisp, however.\\n\\n~~SPECIALS~~\\n* Candied bacon - 4 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slappy-cakes-portland?select=I0F3wwipCvKahqdz-Kd6tA#dufytujpSujSlBUASGJibw\\n(3 strips of bacon caramelized in brown sugar & topped w/ roasted hazelnuts. $5.50)\\nTasty! Crispy, a good balance of sweet & savory flavors, plus the hazelnuts added a nice additional crunch.\\n\\n* Pancake special (unsure what this was, but tasty) - 4 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slappy-cakes-portland?select=I0F3wwipCvKahqdz-Kd6tA#tac8ggXpdHqfhQm5JtqC-Q\\nTried a bite of my friend's and this was soft, moist, and tasty.\\n\\n~~PANCAKES~~\\nCombo #1:  Whole grain batter, blueberries, creme fraiche\\nCombo #2: Sweet potato batter, blue cheese, bacon, creme fraiche, maple syrup\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slappy-cakes-portland?select=I0F3wwipCvKahqdz-Kd6tA#I0F3wwipCvKahqdz-Kd6tA\\nCombo #3: Buttermilk batter, bacon, blueberries, maple syrup\\nCombo #4: Sweet potato batter, apples, pecans, goat cheese\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slappy-cakes-portland?select=I0F3wwipCvKahqdz-Kd6tA#-hgfSP0FkXO_VVM0OsLK4A\\n\\nCombo #'s aren't from the menu - this was just what each person at the table ended up creating. Everything was delicious! I highly recommend the sweet potato batter - the flavor actually comes through really nicely and my #4 combo worked out with nice autumn flavors, plus the goat cheese added a bit of sweetness while the green apples were crisp and tart. \\n\\nAll the batters came out just dense enough, moist, and just had excellent texture.

Not undercooked, though, and the excess cheese was browned nicely on the edges. The sauce is very thin and SUPER sweet. The cheese, again, is poured on, and congeals quickly into a leathery sort of sheet that falls off of the entire piece when you try to take a bite. Points for not using canned mushrooms, but overall, this was what we call a \\"bummer pizza\\". If this pizza had been free, I would call this a \\"not great pizza\\". But this pizza was not free. I had to pay for this pizza. Bummer.\\n\\nThe Salad:\\nHad high hopes for the Greek salad, since I called ahead and they assured me it comes with pepperoncini and kalamata olives. It does, but when your lettuce is pale green and starting to brown, your tomatoes are mealy, and the feta is added as a dry dusting of some sort, you cease caring about your olives and pepperoncini. Granted, not all the veggies included are in season, but if I've got to put up with the environmental fallout of a globalized food system, at least give me a decent tomato.\\n\\nI'm not mad, Pinky; I'm disappointed.

The last time we went in for dinner both of our wraps were missing key ingredients such as avocado and sun dried tomatoes. The romantic wrap that we got was missing avocado and was left with only garlic, and a tiny portion of greens. Overall the sandwich was little more than a flavorful flour tortilla.  Very disappointing. Upon taking them back in to see if we could get the missing ingredients the manager was rude and declared that they sell the dishes as is, with or without ingredients thy claimed they came with.

My parents went for their anniversary dinner and had the much spoken about Kevin as their waiter. My mom and I returned anticipating the hilarious and informative waitering stylings of Kevin, only to get another server instead. But our spirits would not be dampened. \\n\\nWe began with a grapefruit and rum drink. A little sweet for me, but my mom was lapping it up and searching for her cherry in a matter of minutes. Although the noise level was a little on the high side, the atmosphere was festive and reminded me of a fun New York style restaurant with waiters dressed in cute little coats and a long bar. \\n\\nAfter our drink and some delic raisin walnut bread (again, a bit sweet for me, but my mom was again, swooning), we ordered. My mom got the sea bass served with bok choy and I ordered the sword fish with onion rings and cream spinach. \\n\\nNow, I must admit that I am a fan of Goldfish's sea bass and spinach dish, so I was hard on my mom's, but it even surpassed Goldfish. It was delicious! Her fish was perfectly cooked...buttery and flaky. My fish was hearty and meaty. I let the chef cook it how he feels swordfish should be cooked--medium well. And I'm glad I did...It was like a fish steak with peppercorns on top. If you're not a huge pepper fan, don't order my dish. \\n\\nThe cream spinach was perhaps the highlight of my dish. Decadent and savory with just enough sweetness to cut any bitterness of the spinach. Seriously, my mouth is watering thinking of the the spinach. The onion rings were fun, but I could have done with or without them on the plate...but I am not a huge fried food fan in general unless it involves snickers bars being coated in corn dog batter (but that's for another review!).  \\n\\nWill I return to C&S? Undoubtedly! If for no other reason than to get that damn Kevin! If I go I want to try a steak and some oysters and maybe even some dessert.

Luckily we ran into friends, and while we noticed we were pushing an hour with no call we didn't mind too terribly much. Upon arrival back at the restaurant, it turns out they couldn't read each others hand-writing and had been dialing the wrong number. Whatever. We were sat promptly and they brought out an awesome antipasto dish as an apology. Accepted!\\n\\nWe ordered a Barbera to drink and it was fabulous. I ordered the Linguine Squarciarella which was super decadent/rich/flavorful/guilt-riddled. It was no surprise that it was the favorite at the table. My MIL got the Bucatini which she thought was just ok- I thought it was good, but the noodles were a little thick. There is no doubt that the pasta is freshly made and de-lish. \\n\\nThe service was a bit slow but not annoyingly so, and our server was so...Italian/charming/adorable. In fact, everyone there (servers, owners, patrons) seemed to be Italian. I suppose that's when you know you're in for the real thing, folks.

I'm not a big red meat eater so I usually stick to seafood but my first visit I tried the pork chops and they were divine (the current menu is a little different.) Since then my favorites have become the Pecan Crusted Catfish and Broiled Rainbow Trout.

It definitely wouldn't have been our first choice, but it was almost 10:30PM and we were pretty desperate. We weren't sure if they were open so we made sure to ask. The guy working assured us that they were and told us to pick a table. \\nThe prices were decent for pho. The quality of food was not. I ordered the wonton soup. The broth was a little on the salty side, the wontons had all fallen apart, and the egg noodles were mediocre. I was ready to gnaw my arm off from hunger, so I wolfed the food down anyway. \\nOne of the waitresses came by and dropped off our check fairly quickly. It took them longer to serve us the food than it took for her to give us the check. I paid the check, leaving a 20% tip, and continued eating because I had barely made a dent in my food. \\nAt 10:58pm, the waiter came by to tell us \\"we close at 11, so can you just hurry up?\\" We were still clearly in the process of finishing our food, but we were doing our best to finish quickly. About 5 seconds after he had walked back to he kitchen, the waitress that had dropped off the check came out and gave us a pointed look. \\nNow feeling highly uncomfortable, I started to scarf my food down. The two employees then proceeded to stand by the door with their bags, making it very obvious that we, the paying customers, were inconveniencing them. \\nI wasn't expecting anything spectacular walking into the shop, but considering we did ask if they were still open for customers, and we did tip them decently, I feel like the rude treatment was not only unwarranted, but unacceptable. Sure, the price is cheap, but in my opinion, I'd rather get a cheap meal at McDonald's and be spared the frankly crap decor and service.

Unlike another place I went to where folks rolled out the carts filled with small dishes, here you get a paper menu and another menu with the pictures of each dim sum dish, so you get a general idea of what each one is if you've never had dim sum before. You mark off what you want on the paper menu and hand it back to the server. I like their method as you can see the prices for each dish, so you'll get a general idea of how much you're spending. \\n\\nAll our dishes didn't come out at once, it was staggered, which we did like. The stir fried beef with the crispy noodles was very tasty and not dried out. The shrimp dumplings were also good and so was the roast pork pastry, even though it was a little too sweet for our liking. Each little dish come with 3-4 pieces of dim sum, so it's great for sharing if you're with a group. If you like to add spice to your dim sum, request the chili oil, they will give you the glass container and you can add more or less depending on your taste buds. We love a lot of spice so we pretty much used up half the container, lol. Service was pretty good, our server refilled our water when it was needed. \\n\\nA pretty good dim sum restaurant.

Like, I could probably have eaten a whole pig or something. But regardless. My friend found this place, and after what seemed like a super long time walking, we finally found it. It's a small, cozy little place where you order, pay, and pick up your food at the counter. They have the menu up on a chalkboard, but they also have paper ones as well. You can see them making the food right behind the counter...mmmmmm. The pizzas there looked delicious, but they were huge and I don't know if the two of us could've successfully split one. If you're going there with like 4 people I'd definitely get one though! Too bad they don't sell them by the slice...\\nWe ended up getting the Meatball Pomodero with Linguine ($10.99) and the Shrimp Fra Diavolo with their homemade fusili ($13.99 +$1.95ish for the fusili). I was kind of skeptical about the linguine at first, because I saw some other patrons eating it and it didn't look impressive at all, and I was also skeptical about the shrimp dish as well, because I'm not a huge fan of shrimp. But when the dishes came (definitely in less than the 10-15 minutes they predicted, yay!), they were good. Like, my hunger may have made me biased, but still. The linguine wasn't bad; nothing special but it was still decent. The meatballs (it came with 3) were really good! They were huge and filling, and were nice and moist as well. The tomato sauce seemed fresh, but we did add quite a bit of chili flakes to it to intensify the flavor. The shrimp dish was good as well. The shrimp was a little too overcooked and therefore was tough, but the dish itself was nicely flavored (though it wasn't spicy as advertised- we ended up adding a lot of chili flakes to this as well). The fusili, however, was the star of the dish. It melded well with everything (thank you to the cashier for recommending it!). It was chewy and hearty, and as it was the first time I've ever had fusili, I was pretty amazed. I guess the extra fee was worth it. Between the two of us, we finished the two pretty big dishes. We didn't tip as we paid up at the counter, but the cashier lady was really nice and helpful regardless. The staff is all really cheery and happy and I really appreciated it. If you're looking for homey Italian food that's not too expensive, I would definitely give this a try! As a Northeastern student, Cambridge is a little far for me to travel just for pasta, but if I'm ever in the area I would definitely come back.

They use local or organic ingredients mostly which is nice, and everything always tastes pretty fresh. At this point I've had much of the menu, and some things are better than others. \\n\\nThe Eat Your Veggies bowl is pretty bland unless doused in Sriracha or hot sauce. The bean and cheese and chicken burritos are pretty good and fairly inexpensive, usually the mini burrito is filling enough and a whole burrito makes me feel bad about myself and the direction my life has been taking. As far as salads, both the Highway to Kale and the Kale Cesar salads are really good, the dressing for each is very flavorful and if you like kale you can't go wrong with either.\\n\\nAs far as smoothies go, the PBJ smoothie is my favorite. It has a mix of strawberry, banana, peanut butter and apple juice that somehow tastes almost exactly like a PB&J sandwich.

We came across The Daily Catch on Yelp and the pictures of their food sold the deal! First of all, it was kinda hard to find. They have a very small store front but it's even smaller when you walk in! The kitchen is literally inside the seating area. Therefore, they have only about 5 small tables for service. Luckily we came on a weekday lunch time. I can't imagine the wait time during weekend busy hours. We sat down and realized there was no menu. They have everything they offer on a big blackboard hanging on the wall. One thing to note on the board: CASH ONLY!!!! like other places in this area. We selected two of their popular dishes on the menu then watched the chef went to work. It was great to have the kitchen in the restaurant because we got to see each of preparation steps and smelled the delicious food as it gets ready. I absolutely loved both of dishes we ordered. \\n\\nBLACK PASTA AGLIO OLIO - ground squid sauteed with garlic and olive oil. Two portion sizes, entree or appetizer. Even the appetizer portion was big enough to share. I loved their home-made ink pasta! cooked perfectly, flavorful and compliments perfectly with the ground squid sauce made with garlic and olive oil. It's amazing how simple ingredients can create such complex flavors. I enjoyed every bite of this plate. \\n\\nLOBSTER FRA DIAVOLO - lobster, mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp over pasta in spicy red sauce. Wow! I wish there are more places serving this type of pasta! It features the entire lobster in the pasta. The red spicy tomato sauce was perfect agent combining all the strong seafood flavors. This dish was large enough for 3 people in my opinion. There were lots of seafood and large amount of pasta as well.\\n\\nIt was an amazing lunch for us, probably the best meal we had in Boston.

Pretty much everything was lacking. \\n\\nFirst of all, it's old and in need of some attention. I felt like I was in a 'Restaurant Impossible' episode. We arrived at 4 and so were seated in the cafe area since the dinner area wasn't open. The floor was dirty and damaged and my chair was ripped up a well. We actually liked the decor in the restaurant as well as the great mural behind the sushi counter, but the rest needed maintenance. The bathrooms were small, poorly lit, and dark. The urinal is in plain sight of the non locking door. \\n\\nThis place also seems like it has an identity crisis. A clearly traditional Japanese restaurant with a projector showing ESPN and playing jazz in the background. I was almost as confused as the restaurant was!\\n\\nI also found the food to be largely lackluster. The hand rolls were pretty tasty. The spicy tuna had a lot of meat but was lacking the spicy. The unagi hand roll was tasty. Unfortunately the spicy hamachi roll (not hand roll) was not good. Absolutely flavorless from fish to spicy mayo sauce. The Tokyo ramen was also disappointing. The broth was bland and there was only one piece of meat in the bowl. The meat was the best part and I only got one taste! To their credit, the soft boiled egg was delicious and perfect. \\n\\nThe best thing we had was the okonomiyaki. Prepared well, a generous portion, and a good price. Here's my gripe. We came in wanting it. We were the only people in the restaurant. At 430 we asked for it and were told no because it wasn't 5 yet and they weren't serving dinner. Really? That's the level of service you provide? So we waited as maybe one other table was seated before 5 and then once the clock struck, all of the sudden they were able to make our food.

We were greeted my one of the servers/hosts and gave them the name the reservation was under, only for her to inform us that one had not been made. I had her double check, and sure enough my name was there and we were taken to our table; not a big deal at all, just slightly weird. \\n\\nWe were then greeted by our server who seemed quite nice. We ordered right away, with 4 jasmine teas, 1 soup for 4, and 3 other dishes. \\n\\nI'll start with the good first:\\n1. The jasmine teas arrived pretty quickly. \\n2. The food, when it eventually arrived, was actually quite tasty. \\n\\nAnd that is where the good stuff ends.\\n\\nIt had been about 30 minutes since we had ordered our food, and we hadn't even received our soup yet. We waived one of the other servers down, as our server was no where to be found. We informed her of the situation, and she went to go check on it.  I mean yes, I get that you're busy, but hello, it's damn soup! Finally 10 minutes later, our soup showed up, after a tedious 40 minute wait. \\n\\n10 minutes after that, our first two dishes arrived, along with 3 rice. So what do we see in one of the bowls of rice? A RUBBER BAND. I'm not even kidding, I should have taken a picture, but oh well. \\n\\nNow at this point, I am sure that there are people that would have left given what we had endured, but considering we were so hungry, we bit the bullet. We had our rice exchanged by our original server, who finally decided to show up, and our third dish arrived after that. \\n\\nLet us talk about portions here for a second. Each of the dishes was not even enough to to feed HALF a person. The food was tasty yes, but when the food, which is rather expensive may I add compared to other Thai restaurants, can be finished in three bites and half the plate is filled with plain salad, Houston we've got a problem.  \\n\\nFurthermore, even though our server may have been nice in the beginning, she had turned into a semi-rude emotionless snob, by the end of our dinner. This may be because every single other table was complaining about how no one had received there food, and one table beside us even received a soup that they had already been given earlier. Our server was also approached by a man from another table beside us, who was inquiring about the insane wait times. Instead of being courteous, her response was, \\"look, everyone else's food is delayed too, so what do you want me to do about it?\\". I understand that servers get most of the heat for mistakes being made in the kitchen, but considering that they are the point of contact for the customers, more decency and kindness would not have hurt. \\n\\nSo let's recap. \\nThe GOOD was: seated relatively quickly, tasty food, jasmine tea arrived quickly, which was okay at best. \\n\\nThe BAD was: the insane wait times to actually get our food, the fact that there was a rubber band in the rice, everyone else was complaining, the restaurant was completely disorganized, and our server was not pleasant. \\n\\nJudging by the other reviews, maybe my experience was a one off kind of thing, but I won't be returning to this restaurant to test that theory. There are far better, tastier, and better portion giving Thai restaurants than this one."},{"name":"Thunderbird Coffee","address":"2200 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Near my son's school, so we've stopped here several times.

I never write a bad review, I don't have time for it but what I experienced to day was disappointing. The WORST experience ever.\\n\\nI've been to this restaurant multiple times so I am well aware of the so called \\"policy\\" that every guests have to be present in order to be seated. Ok.. no problem, we respect it (although it's kind of a stupid policy to be honest). Five of us got to the restaurant today and were seated where it was supposed to be a four people seating, it was very uncomfortable so we asked if we could moved to a bigger table (there were 4-5 empty tables). We ordered our food and while we were waiting, my husband called to ask where we are and he decided he wanted to join us. So I informed the server that we won't need to move to another table anymore and asked if we could pull another empty table to combine since we have one more person coming. The server politely denied my request and said the policy doesn't allow to add another person to our group. Are you kidding? I wasn't sure if he was joking.\\n\\nMy friend asked him so what is he gonna do once my husband got here, he said my husband will have to wait and they'll have to seat him at another table. What the heck?? Why do you think my husband would even want to come and be seated by himself at another table watching his wife and friends eating at another table? Ridiculous! The server said he could go talk to the manager, but then the manager came back and inform us about the same stupid policy, saying it would be unfair to the rest of the customers if we were allowed to add one more person to the party (there were about 4-5 empty tables). While this was going on, they brought another couple to the table next to us (the one we requested) so we knew they weren't going to budge. We decided to leave right when the first item was brought to the table. We were disgusted by the way they treated us, we asked for the item to be packed and cancel the rest of our meal. The manager said she would have the item packed for us and she's not going to charge us. No Ma'am, we don't like the way we were treated, that's why we're leaving, we don't want free food. Your free food is as good as slaps in our faces.. keep your food. \\n\\nI know rules are rules but if you're in a service business, you make each decision on case-by-case basis. You bend a little to keep your customers happy. They treated us like we plan this, intentionally tricking and hiding information about another person that might show up? We don't have time for that. Also there's a sign saying that they can begin seating once 70% of party have arrived and there's no other people waiting. So 5 out of 6 is not enough? and there were about 4-5 empty tables.  \\n\\nWe'll never be back. Our server was nice. Food has always been mediocre. Yuzu has wayyyy better ramen, we only come here because it's convenient, but not anymore after today.

I absolutely love Thunderbird! The coffee/espresso here is great. The baristas have all been really friendly. The atmosphere is really nice and friendly. The place is super cute and vibrant and welcoming.\\n\\nThere aren't a ton of seats/outlets, so that might be the biggest pain--finding somewhere to settle down. It's like war if you go at the wrong time. Outside seating is awesome, but I have never seen outlets out there, so it's kind of a hit or miss depending on what you're planning to do at the coffee shop. If you're with friends, and it's nice outside, then there's usually always outside seating available. If it's terrible weather and you want to study, good luck finding a good seat.\\n\\nMy favorite drink is the honey nut latte--it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Even when I ask for extra shots of espresso, it still tastes great and keeps me going for hours.\\n\\nI've tried the Thai Iced Coffee--meh, not my favorite. It tastes like me trying to make coffee with sweetened condensed milk at home (my terrible attempts when I'm craving Viet Iced Coffee), which usually doesn't end so well. I've tasted better Thai Iced Coffee at actual Thai restaurants, but I guess the point here is that it's coffee and sweetened condensed milk.\\n\\nThe only thing I really hate is finding parking. You can park in the local neighborhood, but even then it can get crowded and be a pretty far walk. Sometimes, I get lucky with the parking lot. Other times, some person will pull in even though I've been sitting in my car with my blinker on. Parking is just the worst thing about Thunderbird. \\n\\nOverall, love Thunderbird.

The beds were comfortable (the pull out couch not so much), the staff friendly. \\n\\nA couple caveats though...they literally charge for everything here (seems to be typical of most higher end hotels though)... We asked about their shuttle to the Disney parks and were told we should purchase the 'resort' package at the front desk for an extra $30/day. The resort package included wifi access, gym access (I'm pretty sure that was included already though???), use of the Disney park shuttle (it stated on their website this was free???), and 2 inner tubes...the location is relatively isolated so if you do not have your own car or other means of transportation you are essentially stuck on the resort. \\n\\nThere are a number of food options here but they are also quite pricey. My dad had lunch at the pool as we originally did not have a rental car. He got a sandwich and a beer for $40...yikes. The food and alcohol was cheaper at the Disney parks to our astonishment. Wifi is $15-20/day. Parking is $15-20/day...things are adding up quickly. \\n\\nNo airport shuttle so if you don't rent a car, t costs around $40-50 for a traditional cab. If you didn't rent a car, you can do so through Hertz directly from the hotel. Hertz will drop off the car for you. Convenient? Yes! Cheap? No! It will cost you around $100/day. Do yourself a favor and take an Uber cab ($16) to the airport and rent one there ($25-30/day) if you, like us, did not plan ahead and find yourself stuck on the resort with a limited menu with exorbitant prices.\\n\\nThe pool is only 3.5 ft deep (no diving please haha!) this didn't matter to me but my dad was disappointed. The pool isn't the shape of a traditional pool. It is more of a lazy river but there did seem to be a little lagoon like area. The hotel also has a sort of reciprocity with the Ritz next door and they have a beautiful ( also shallow) pool with fountains in a more traditional shape.\\n\\nSo in sum, the hotel and grounds are picturesque. The rooms are comfortable. The staff is friendly. However, any extras will cost you and add up quite quickly. Do not assume anything is included.

Most places I go to charge any where from $15 to $30 for a single entree of lobster or crab legs.  The main items of lobster and crab legs were excellent and the other items on the buffet were also good.  However, I would say that you don't want to spend $40 plus per plate if you are not inclined to consume lobster and crab legs.  The buffet also has raw oysters, mussels, and clams, which can also be expensive when dining out.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, I found the service staff to be very attentive and helpful.

The beans are stewed so well it would make its own tasty soup. Tip: mix the rice and beans together to make them even more savory and get the different textures. The plate is huge, and everything is good.\\n\\nDid I mention my love for plantains? Thank god for Latin and Caribbean cuisine that features them heavily. Here you can get maduros (cooked sweet plantains) or tostones (fried unsweet plantains, paired with a killer garlic sauce called mojo) on the side. I would eat them both all day long if possible. Plantain and garlic... the ingredients that complement each other never cease to surprise me. And don't forget dessert - their rice pudding is out of this world.

It was absolutely SWIMMING in their delicious alfredo sauce. And yeah, it's cooked al dente - so if you think that's \\"undercooked\\" you might have a problem. But they're a proper Italian restaurant so it's what you would expect.\\n\\nI'd suggest that you get there when they open, but since it seems difficult to know exactly when that is, I'd say - be prepared to wait, but you'll be in and out of there quickly (they're highly motivated to turn over tables) and you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My friend and I came in during a Red Sox game and  Enio took care of us.

Another 2 girls were seated at the table right next to us - a bit too close for comfort but luckily we weren't too distracted by them.\\n\\nOur drink order was taken quickly and drinks arrived shortly after but it took a long while to order our food.  The 2 girls next to us put in their orders before the waiter realized we were still waiting.\\n\\nThere were oodles of options.  Lots of sweet (French Toast all sorts of ways) and savory (eggs all sorts of ways).  There was also an extensive list of sandwiches for lunch.  My friend ordered half an order of chocolate french toast and eggs over easy while I got my usual scrambled eggs w/bacon.  I like that they offer half orders of the french toast because an entire order is always too rich and sweet - sometimes you just want a few bites.  However her \\"half\\" order was still ridiculous and I gladly helped her finish it.  It was DELICIOUS.  My eggs were fine - nothing special.  The rosemary home fries were tasty though.\\n\\nI noticed a long line forming inside and outside of the restaurant, which is typical at a brunch place but what was strange was that there were so many empty tables inside.  I realize now that they were probably reserved but it really didn't make sense to me to have some people waiting outside for what seemed like 20+ minutes while tables were unused inside.  I guess this is why many brunch spots don't take reservations.\\n\\nGetting our check was another challenge - as a previous reviewer wrote, the waiters and waitresses did a good job avoiding our attempts at eye contact.  Luckily I needed to kill some time before catching my bus at South Station so I didn't mind the wait but I can see people on a tighter schedule getting annoyed.  Though the wait staff was friendly and amenable to our requests it they could have been a bit more attentive.\\n\\nOverall it was a good experience for what we needed - a cozy spot to duck in out of the rain with affordable options for caffeine and brunch food where we could hang out and chat, not to far from South Station."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"During my Portland visit I knew I had to check this place out and see what the hype was all about. \\n\\nThe place is super tiny and a little bit of a drive outside of Portland. They offer you and option to sit inside or \\"outdoors\\" with heated gas lamps. Decided to eat outside and I liked it a lot. It seemed very authentic and cute. I did take a peek at the indoor area and it was completely different. They're like two different restaurants, it's crazy! \\n\\nAnyways, the infamous fish sauce wings were just okay to me. I'm not a seafood lover or anything but I didn't think it'd be that heavily flavored with fish sauce. It was too much for me. It was good, but waaaaaayyyyy toooo fishy. I even started peeling off the skin and began eating the meat alone. Just wasn't too impressed with their signature dish. What did impress me was the Khao Soi! Man, that dish really stole the show. That was super delicious and really enjoyed it. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I visited during the lenten season. I gave up rice and wasn't able to try their selection of rice (jasmine, sticky and coconut). I really wanted to try the coconut rice, maybe next time! \\n\\nPok Pok is a cute place that serves up authentic Thai food! the staff is welcoming and friendly.

That is really a rarity in Boston (and it's not that the place was deserted). Both the hostess and the waiter were extremely nice and attentive throughout the meal. It was the best service I've had in some time, which is what is prompting me to write this review. We had a lovely window-side table in this little nook. The wine was excellent.

They have a pretty good happy hour special on margaritas and half off drafts from 4-7.

Service has always been pretty attentive, but definitely not paced for a fast lunch or dinner, so if you're at Gateway and strapped for time I'd probably consider somewhere else. \\n\\nFood: Chips and salsa is your standard tex-mex fare, good but nothing super special.  I am a huge fan of their fajitas, they are fantastic and give you a really good portion.

The restaurant was within walking distance from our hotel and offered French cuisine which seemed to be popular in Boston, MA.  We arrived thirty minutes before the restaurant's final serving time and they allowed us to be seated upstairs and order our whole meal before the kitchen closed that night.  At the restaurant, there were two floors to eat on with different vibes.  The first floor had indoor and outdoor seating as well as a bar with a very European vibe.  The second floor felt more dressy and romantic as the room was quieter and the windows provided an overlook of Boston Common.\\n\\nTo start off, we ordered cocktails from the menu.  My girlfriend had a sweet cocktail while I went with the La Truffe Noire which was a $33 black truffle and bourbon cocktail.  I fell in love with this drink instantly as I have always treasured the flavor of black truffles and bourbon once they entered my life.  The combination provided a delicious cocktail and led me to purchase a second as I have not seen anything like this anywhere else.  I definitely recommend trying this cocktail if you come here, it is well worth the $33.\\n\\nFrom the cru section of the dinner menu, we had the tuna tartare and the lamb tartare.  The tuna tartare was very good and fresh.  The lamb tartare was also very good and provided a nice difference from the usual steak tartare.  I personally love most types of tartare if it involves raw meat or seafood and the lamb was definitely worth trying and I would eat it again.  This was the first time I ever had lamb tartare.  From the premiers plats, I ordered the seared foie gras which was very good.  I also love foie gras and they definitely made it properly compared to some places I have eaten it at in the past year.  We also had the crispy pork belly which was a nice rectangular cut and packed a nice amount of flavor.\\n\\nFor mer & terre, my girlfriend had the cavatelli pasta and I had the braised lamb neck.  The cavatelli pasta was pretty good and the rabbit sausage in it was good.  The braised lamb neck was very good and the meat was so tender it fell right off of the bone.  It was a delicious dish but due to all of the previous food I was unable to finish it and truly enjoy it to the max.  For dessert, we shared the chocolate souffl√© which was extremely good and should definitely be ordered if you dine here.

This place was suggested by Mike from Mike and Patty's(Sandwich Place)...and so we decided to give it a shot...\\n\\nTake Note: We weren't even hungry yet. And yes, we are very well aware that Gluttony is a sin. \\n\\nIt was around 5pm when we walked in. I had no idea this place gets table reservations as early as 5pm. The hostess, greeted us and asked for our reservations. Uhmm. We didn't have one. \\n\\nI told her we were hoping we could just shoot oysters at the bar and grab drinks... but apparently, the oyster bar was already full...BUT super awesome hostess saves the day! She accommodated us to sit at a table with a dinner reservation at 6:30. SOLD. We just have to be out by 6:15-ish...enough time. As i said.. we were only there for oysters and drinks. \\n\\nThat's what I thought.... Well i thought wrong.\\n\\nOur amazing server, brought us the full food and cocktail/wine menu and that's when the drooling phase happened. I saw the words \\"Lobster Roll\\".\\nAnd to make it worse, I saw another server trotting around a tray with a plate of this scrumptious looking Lobster Roll. AND I had to have that. \\n\\nBut then again...we weren't really hungry.\\n\\nAnd so we thought...we could always share...the Lobster roll...and an order of oysters. What a deal.\\n\\nOur server brought us some of their freshly baked bread, and homemade butter. The bread was good...but what made it even better, was the BUTTER. Room-temperatured butter, that's made with cayenne pepper and honey. I seriously wanted to scoop it up and eat it like yogurt.\\n\\nMy friend and i decided to get:\\n\\n*Baked Oysters Special: \\n\\n4 beautifully shucked Island Creek Oysters sitting on a scoop of seasalt, accented with a slice of lemon. \\nThe oysters were fresh, and the celery, onion and bread crumbs topped on them made the whole oyster eating experience truly exceptional. The crusty layer of breadcrumbs didn't overpower the oyster.... and the celery cream that oozes out after sucking the oyster out of the shell is...amazing..Oh gosh. Typing this up and thinking about it makes drool in my mouth. \\n\\n*Ethel's Lobster Roll: \\n\\nMy friend and i told our server to give us two plates so we can split the roll...he came back with 2 plates of already sliced lobster rolls with our own portions of coleslaw and kettle chips!\\nTalk about outstanding customer service.\\nOh gosh. My first bite of this was heavenly. It seriously faded away 98% of my stress level, and made me happy for the rest of the night. First of all, the Rosemary roll was soft and chewy and good.... and the best part..the huge chunks of cold lobster tucked generously in the roll. It was cooked perfectly, and whatever they mixed in there, just left me speechless....that i wanted to keep on chewing and chewing and chewing..until I got to my last bite....I had to pause and.... pose for a picture with it. Ha.\\nIt came with Kettle chips and Coleslaw. But eh. i was super focused on the lobster roll i didn't really pay attention to the sides.\\n\\n* 2009 Domaine Talmard Macon -Chardonnay\\n\\nI really liked the fact that our server came with the whole bottle of it for me to try first, before generously pouring me a glass of my own. \\nOh...this is when our server and I chatted it up. When he checked my ID and found out we're from California. He's so cool...that he gave up tips on where to go to..what to see...and such.\\n\\n\\nAs for the ambiance... I was amazed. It's like a dimly lit restaurant...with the oyster bar on the right, and the high tables on the left... the decor is very minimal, modern and hip. Down the steps, is the bigger dining area wherein the wall is beautifully accented with wood and little ceramic tiles and the ceiling is accented with modern lights. Such a good and classy vibe here.

It came with 4 small pieces. \\n\\nSalmon dish - didn't try as it was friend's dish but the salmon portion was decently sized but came with very little or sparse asparagus.

The wings were by far the BEST out of the 3 options. Nice and spicy, but actually not too spicy. The level was perfectly where it needed to be to give you subtle kick where it was not overpowering. De-boning the wing, and taking a bite with the pickled vegetables, gave the dish a wonderful balance of freshness to the sweet kick of spiciness. I would actually order this dish alone 2-3 times. The final dish, the Sai Ua Samun was honestly alright. Sausage was good, however, I would have passed on this.\\n\\nSomething I really liked about Pok Pok was their alcohol selection.

I returned after many years of aji-abstinence and due to the scarcity of late night choices in Vancouver.  The rice in rolls have improved. From what I remember the rice is softer and tasty compared to years back when it was dry and hard. Fried items are no longer soggy and heavy with oil but lighter like tempura should be.  The chicken thou was dissapointing as the sizzling plate and robata skewers were dry and heavily assaulted... with SALT.  Stay away from the oyster motoyaki unless you have a strong stomach.

Some changes have been good and some not so good.  \\n\\nI decided to stick with the happy hour menu which surprisingly offers a great selection of appetizers from pick 2 dips, chicken wings, quesadillas, deviled eggs, Mexican meatballs etc.  They also offer drink specials as well.  I highly recommend either their house margarita or the prickly pear margarita.  Both are quite tasty! \\n\\nI ordered the chicken quesadillas to start and enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsas while we waited. There is a fire roasted corn and traditional which both are very tasty.  If you're wanting a little heat then stick with the corn salsa. \\n\\nThe quesadillas were very cheesy which is how I like them.  The chicken was seasoned pretty nicely but I have to admit they needed more flavor.  They do come with a small side of guacamole and lettuce which is used to spruce up the flavor and it definitely helped.  \\n\\nThe regular menu started floating around and I noticed that they had Mexican street corn so I decided to order since it's one of my favorite things to order at a Tex mex restaurant.  I honestly expected a whole ear of corn that was covered with crema, spices, and Mexican cheese.  I was surprised to see a mason jar filled with layers of roasted corn, cheese, crema and cilantro.  I took one bite and so many emotions ran through me! I wish that I would have known this was on the menu first before ordering anything.  The party that was going on in my mouth didn't want to stop!!! Lol!!!  My friends thought something was wrong when they saw my face cause I literally froze in time. Yes it was that good!!!!

I had a flight in the early afternoon so I checked out of the hotel around 9 am and got through security by 10. I know that's very early (4 hours) but I like to get to the gate early and not be rushing trying to get through security. So I had some time to kill and decided to get some lunch as my connecting flight in Philly would not give me an opportunity to do so.  I chose Eddie George's Grille 27 because (1) it was close to the gate, (2) seating at the right side of the restaurant had power outlets and (3) the restaurant was bright as it had large windows that overlooked the runway. As I set down I read the reviews on Yelp and come to the general conclusion that the comments fell into two areas - slow service and a good burger. As I had time to kill (2 hours until my flight boarded) I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Burger 27 at 11:55 am and it arrived at 12:05 (10 minutes is not excessive at all IMHO).  The burger is a hand made patty comprised of Short Rib, Beef Chuck and Bacon on a brioche bun and comes with fries lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly. It is very good and because of the bacon it doesn't need any salt.nAs for service there seemed to be only one waitress at first but i noticed that as time went on are and more waitresses appeared (it must be about shift change) in any case my waitress was prompt and courteous.

That said, my visit to Bistro du Midi was fulfilling in every respect. It only receives 4 stars because it would have to be perfect to get 5...don't be put off though. It's well worth a visit.\\nMy evening started with a glass of Pernod downstairs. That pastis puts your palette in the mood for a good Southern French meal. My appetizer was the foie gras. The portion was small, but it's such a rich plate that it was more than adequate. Freshly sauteed and deglased, it melted like butter. Accompanied by a glass of Ste. Croix du Mont (in the style of a Sauterne), I thought I had died and gone to heaven. This was followed by the Classic Bouillabaisse. The chef adds a bit of pastis to the sauce (not typical in my experience). This gave it a very unique and enjoyable flavor, tying it back to my aperitif. The fish was flaky and flavorful. Home-made bread accompanied this plate. A bottle of Sancerre took the sweetness off the pastis. Dessert was a chevre cheesecake. It's hard to go wrong with goat cheese in my estimation, but this was exceptional cheesecake. It was accompanied by a basil sorbet, very unique. Un cafe express finished off a delightful meal.\\nThe service was extraordinary from the Russian waiter (Egor) to the Maitre d' (John) to the General Manager and Sommelier (Randy).

I've always had a ramen dilemma for some of my favorite people in my life just because they don't eat pork.. whether it be dietary restrictions or preferences due to health, religious, or just personal taste buds.  And these people do love ramen or want to try it.\\n\\nThere's actually two places in town, but this is the only Ramen shop out of the two that not only has one chicken based bowl, but has actual chicken meat. The other store has a chicken based broth served only with pork meat. \\n\\nUsually in those rare cases of finding such a place like this.. the meat or broth is only mediocre, but no this place is a gem from any of their bowls: there's no compromise. \\n\\n-\\n\\nMe and my brothers all got Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and I recommend it. It's not as salty as other ramen places, but I prefer it this way: it was right on the money.\\n\\nIf you want extra noodles, it's not half of what you already would've gotten, but double that. I personally think that's way overboard. One of my brothers didn't know and he was dying at finishing his bowl. But, what's awesome is you can choose between three types of noodles: thin, wavy, or wide. \\n\\nMy mom got the Spicy Ramen with the spiciest option (still not spicy for her.. but generally speaking: Japanese spicy is never that spicy).. her soup was enjoyable though. \\n\\nMy dad got the Chicken Rich Ramen. He got the low-sodium version (you can do that to all but one ramen dish on their menu) and it was right on the money for him. I thought it could've been saltier if I had it. He said the chicken was really good. He wasn't expecting it to be that good. \\n\\nOverall everyone liked their food. It was honestly a pain in the butt to find a gem like this, but I did it.\\n\\nProbably going down as one my favorite ramen places. \\n\\n-\\n\\nHowever appetizers: they're whatever.. you're usual anywhere you go kind of thing.\\n\\nI will have to say their Takoyaki is the biggest I've ever seen.

Coming from Philadelphia, I was quite comfortable with Korean food and there were two restaurants near the office: Korea Garden (at this location) and Korea House, near the Winn Dixie supermarket.\\n\\nAfter going to Korea Garden a few times for the Al ji gae (fish egg stew), I started going to Korea House after having a few conversations about photography with the owners' sons.  They didn't have al ji gae, but the den jang ji gae and soon dubu ji gae were better than fine.  I like spicy food.  When I took someone from the office with me for lunch, I always suggested the bul gogi, which amounts to grilled meat with sauce, not unlike American BBQ, I suppose, but unlike Korean BBQ.  Bul gogi and Gal bi are safe choices for people unaccustomed to Korean food.  They aren't particularly spicy, if at all.\\n\\nOf course, with each meal come various side dishes, such as spicy radishes, kim chee, and possibly some sweeter variations of the same items.  You also get white, steamed rice and you're welcome to ask for more.\\n\\nIf you're comfortable with real Japanese eating, you'll find things different in Korean life.  You are not supposed to pick up your rice bowl.  That would be bad manners.  It's also likely to burn you at a restaurant since they use steel bowls with steel covers.  I'm sure Won and Moon gave me funny looks when I picked up the rice bowl in a napkin, so I could eat Japanese style.  It's interesting to me that Korean restaurants anywhere I've eaten use lots of stainless steel, including chopsticks.  I don't believe that happens at Korean people's homes, though.\\n\\nWhen I was recently back there, I tried the new location and it was decidedly different.  It wasn't so much the memory of the two old places or the new furnishings, but the charm of a family-owned restaurant was gone.  The prompt, efficient service that Won and Moon gave was also gone.\\n\\nThe food was still excellent.  The father is amazing at that.  However, the restaurant suddenly seemed over-priced because it didn't feel right.  It's not as though there was anything terribly wrong but I didn't enjoy the experience as much.  It's the best place for Korean food in the Orlando area.  I'd tried the place on West Colonial Drive and it wasn't very good, and there is another place just off South Orange Blossom Trail at Oak Ridge that isn't horrible, but Korea House remains the best.\\n\\nUpdate: I went with 3 other people and things seem to be sorted.  The food was still good but the service has caught up with the location.  I was glad to see that they've added vented locations to one side of the restaurant for Korean BBQ.

Usually, we eat sushi in the bar area and that ultimately seems to work - if you can get a seat they can manage to serve you, but this time we were told it would be a while as they were understaffed (big surprise, they always seem to be suffering from poor service). We noticed a table open (in the bar, not restaurant), and when we asked were told that it might be open or might not, there might be someone ahead of us but they may have gone into the dining room instead. Argghh. Just not worth the aggravation. Oh and by the way - if you're a couple or party of two, don't expect to sit at a table in the bar; we were told \\"our policy is not to permit groups of 2 from using a table with 4 seats\\" and guess what - all the tables in the bar have 4 seats."},{"name":"C&S Seafood & Oyster Bar","address":"3240 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 118","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Nice spot in a strip mall North of Atlanta (not near downtown though).

It's not authentic stuff here honey so don't buy into that bullshit from tourists that have visited the motherland.  That's like an Italian joint with hype being the greatest italian in the area, but also serving Greek and Portugese food... hey, we're all in the same proximity so what the hell! So they serve something different other than pad thai, pad see ew; that makes it authentic? Please. Again there's vietnamese food on the damn menu. I've been to Mexico a couple times, I should go open a mexican restaurant then. The chef's been to Thailand a few times, who cares.\\n\\nThen there's the Mama tom yum instant ramen noodles served with prawns, an occasional special written on the board. (I posted the pic above) Also described on the board as the most popular instant ramen in Thailand. ahahahahaha!!!!!  they're charging you for instant ramen!  That's too funny. My dad eats these when he's too lazy to cook. Did you know you can get these in many if not all the asian stores here... for a few cents or the whole case for like 7 or 8 bucks. At Uwajimaya they sell a larger pack of the mama noodles for under a dollar.  (It also comes in a bowl version, you can probably bring to work and just boil that water yourself.) The guy probably drives down to the local asian store pickin up a case of these to serve in his restaurant, while some gullible chump thinks oh wow, you bought these back all the way from thailand? I'm so honored for this exotic, authentic thai experience on the side of Division! Just like the streets of Bangkok!! I'd like to witness the poor soul that actually orders this.\\n\\nI guess the thing is that they add some prawns aka shrimp to your noodles, maybe some veggies. Big whoop. I should open a restaurant one day, charge for serving you some instant ramen the mainstream has never heard of. I just have to boil water and dump a few extras in and people will think it's special. Brilliance!\\n\\nGetting paid to boil water, possibly even getting tipped as well. That's genius. \\n\\nHere's something else Pok Pok has in common with Thailand and Vietnam, you get to experience what it's like being mugged.

Also, she handled all of the soups by the rim which as a server I fundamentally disagree with and find gross.

I like this coffeeshop--it's close to my office, the staff is extremely friendly and fun, and they pull a mean shot.\\n\\nAs a straight espresso drinker, I favor a richer, smoother, more ristretto and less bitter shot. SBC at this location delivers and delivers consistently. Their iced coffee is from a toddy (i.e., cold filtered)--for those of you not in the know, this process renders a smoother, tastier, and frankly more caffeinated glass of iced coffee. A big plus as far as I'm concerned. I'm not as much of a fan of their drip coffee--as a child of Starbucks, I think their drip suffers from the same problem as their parent, which is to say that they roast their beans a little darker to improve shelf life, which invariably compromises flavor quality. If you like Starbucks' drip, SBC's is just fine. If you prefer your drip with more finesse, head to a Stumptown or to a coffeeshop that carries Stumptown. And their blended ice coffee drinks are right in line with the caffeinated-milkshake things everyone else with a blender and a variety of sugary syrups offers. Foodwise, they've got the standard offerings of pastry--danish, scone, muffin, etc.--and breakfast bagel sandwichy things.\\n\\nPrices are very reasonable, too. A double shot of espresso runs $1.85; drip coffee's about the same; mochas and lattes average $2.50-$3; cream cheese danishes and scones are something like $1.50.\\n\\nAnd, again, the staff rocks."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went for my birthday dinner with a few friends, food was delicious, reasonably priced and the portions are huge, so you can take away to enjoy tomorrow.

My husband was not too happy that the waiter did not inform us of the daily special.

The outside of the tiramisu was stripey-looking because it was made from a stripey sheet of cake.  I don't know what they did to that poor cake to make it so unimpressive, but it was dense, rubbery, bland, and not even moistened with anything.\\n\\nThe mascarpone filling of the tiramisu was indeed wonderful:  dense, rich, creamy, just sweet enough, and with a hint of vanilla.  However, it was icy in the middle, and the person who served it to me didn't even mention that it might want to warm up a bit.  And it definitely did not complement the cake part in any way.\\n\\nMaybe their other desserts are better-- I definitely respect that mascarpone filling.  Maybe their full-sized tiramisu is better than their individual-sized.

Honestly, I don't think it could have possibly gone worse than it did. It was awful in all three areas: food, wine, service. It was so bad, we actually had fun laughing at the absurdity of the situation.\\n\\nThe basics: it was a 7-course pre-fixe menu with wine pairing that came to a total of $625 w/ tax + tip. That's pretty expensive, but it was NYE and if we had excellent food, wine and service it would have been worth it.\\n\\nThe food: The razor clam soup was the star of the night. The venison was average. The yellowtail crudo was borderline disgusting, I can't believe it was even served. The octopus was pretty tasty, but that's just because it was octopus, it had a plain sauce and overcooked peppers on the side, that was it. The Loup de Mer (European Seabass) was ok, it wasn't really cooked well as the skin was soggy which is definitely unpleasant. Both gnocchi dishes were actually really good, especially the truffle one, and the portion size was way too big for a tasting.The foie gras with chocolate was a bad decision as the two did not taste good together. It was overly sweet and you couldn't taste the foie because of the chocolate and the cherry. The dessert seemed like it was purchased at Shaws and dropped on a plate.\\n\\nThe wine: The wine was below average at best, poor if i'm being honest. Several of the wines were $10-15 which is unacceptable for this price point ($95/pairing). In addition to that the order was absurd; it went from champagne to white to champagne to red to white to red. We couldn't believe that the sommelier was serious with the selections he made.\\n\\nThe service: There were many issues with the service. The waiter made a few mistakes including pouring the wrong wine for one of our pairings as well as constantly spilling wine onto the table when he poured. Mistakes are ok as everyone is human, but there were a lot of them. In addition, he was simply not trained well enough to be a waiter at a nice restaurant....which apparently Bistro du Midi really isn't. Wine glasses were left on the table when we were drinking champagne, silverware wasn't set or cleared properly. These are all things that you expect to be correct when you're at a nice restaurant paying as much as we did.\\n\\nIn summary - what we learned is that Bistro du Midi is at best faking it. They are not a nice restaurant despite prices and appearances. The chef, sommelier and waiters were unqualified to put together a meal with a price tag like the one we paid."},{"name":"Papa Gino's Pizzeria","address":"Bunker Hill Mall, 19 Austin Street","city":"Charlestown","stars":"2.5","text":"I am not generally a fan of  \\"fast food\\" pizza joints, but since moving to Charlestown I've become a fan of this Papa G's since it is so convenient and has proven consistent in quality and quick delivery.

I could eat eleventy million pounds of this dish\\n\\n * The \\"Provence\\" Sandwich - Cured ham, honey ham, Gruyere, young arugula, caramelized onion, tomato confiture, filone baguette, organic field greens or pommes frites\\nRating - very nice.  Proof that there is no such thing as 'too much ham'\\n\\n * The \\"Normandy\\" Sandwich - Short rib ragout, blue cheese, red pepper relish, radish sprouts, caramelized onion, filone baguette, organic field greens or pommes frites\\nRating - Brilliant!  The meat was juicy and flavourful and all of the ingredients were a wonderful inclusion in this sandwich.\\n\\n *Mushroom and Goat Cheese Frittata - Open faced omelet, mixed mushrooms, caramelized onion, goat cheese, herbed potato hash, fruit salad\\nRating - delicious.  Did I mention that I love mushrooms???\\n\\n *Bouillabaisse - Proven√ßal fish stew, fresh fish, prawns, scallop, Salt Spring Island mussels, clams, shellfish and tomato broth, rouille\\nRating - amazing.  Warms you through.  Great for those cool autumn days, or those chilly winter brunches, ........or summer, or spring.  \\n\\n * Salt Spring Island Mussels - Daily mussels inspired by the season and whimsy of the Tapenade Bistro kitchen. \\nRating - Unbelievably good.  Probably the best mussels I've ever had.  Last visit I told the server that it should come with a straw to suck up all the gorgeous broth.

We put our names in and walked around the district for about 40 minutes.

Actually, getting ahead of myself; the wine list was entirely in Italian.  Knowing nothing about Italian wine (or any Italian), I asked our waiter for a recommendation for a fruit forward red, similar in body to a Cab - he got it spot on, and it was a very reasonably priced pour.  Now on to the food: the bread basket brought out for pre-meal munching was phenomenal.  There were various crusty loaf portions, as well as a few pieces of marinara slathered foccacia, all served up with some divine olive oil and balsamic.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend had a gnocchi that was one of the specials that evening, and I ordered the Paparadelle al Cinghiale.

Prior to this, I had never had Paparadelle al Cinghiale, but I'm now a believer.

When mixed together, they form a powerful combination of delights in your mouth.  The chicken was very flavorful and surprisingly resisted sogginess in a hot soup.  The fried noodles soften slightly but create a nice mix of crunchiness for each bite.  The broth is a type of red curry that is a bit sweet but not terribly spicy.  The level of spiciness was a bit disappointing but that was pretty much the only disappointment of the meal.  I was a bit surprised by the pickled veggies.

In my inner circle, this means everyone can be happy.    \\n\\nThunderbird has a killer beer selection and great specials.  On Friday nights they have a $2.50 mystery beer special.  On the night we were there, among many good \\"mystery\\" beers (because they were serving more than one type of brew), one of the beers they were serving was the Breckenridge Double IPA.  At over $10 a six pack at Spec's, this is a steal.  Aside from this Friday night special, they have something going on every day.  \\n\\nThe coffee is pretty good -- not the best -- but drinkable.  I believe they use Cuvee.  My boyfriend ordered an espresso one night and was not impressed.  Being that Thunderbird *is* a coffee shop, they get one star off for mediocre coffee.  \\n\\nThe location on Manor is bigger than on Koenig and in my opinion, much more comfortable (unless you sit in the booths right next to the door; then you are sitting on a hard-ass bench at a table that comes up to your chin).  My reason for going to coffee shops is to play nerdy board games, so I like that they have big tables, like the picnic tables outside.  Manor is a relatively quiet street so sitting outside is quite enjoyable.  The clientele is pleasant, and Thunderbird doesn't seem to attract the coffee shop loiterers I've seen elsewhere.  \\n\\nI haven't eaten anything so I can't speak for the food.  All I know is if I'm in mixed company (some want beer, some want coffee) and we want to go somewhere low key to chat, play a game, or listen to live music (because they do that here!

Spring Rolls (2) were a hit with a nice soy based dipping sauce and wrapped individually in plastic wrap to keep them fresh, Bulgogi was nicely prepared with plenty of perfectly cooked rice, not too sticky. I asked the cook to select one of her favorites as my final dish . She surprised me with a spicy seafood noodle dish studded with shrimp and mussels in a deep flavored seafood broth, I enjoyed every last drop.

The boar collar, pork belly, papaya salad, and wings were all delicious, although a friend ordered the wings extra spicy and they came out somewhere between magma and solar flares. I love spicy - I truly, truly do - but these were definitely on the pain side of the spectrum. Like, don't eat and then touch your eyes unless you want to go to the hospital. The friend's fault, I suppose, though none of us could've guessed that extra spicy actually means \\"forged in the fires of Mt. Doom\\". One wing to rule them all, indeed.\\n\\nSo why one star? A few reasons, the most egregious being the 3.5 hour wait. Yes, 3.5 hours. I was ready to throw in the towel and hit up the taco truck down the street about 45 minutes in, but the friend was persistent and so we all suffered down at their Whiskey Soda Lounge. We kept going back - \\"Oh, it'll just be another half hour\\" - for 3.5 hours. Ri.Di.Cu.Lous. Another reason? Tiny food. Overpriced tiny food. If your waiter says, \\"We recommend that everyone order 2-3 dishes\\" you should probably just light something on fire and run away screaming. I simply cannot sign off on Pok Pok. Without the wait?

(I've been coming here since the 90s when it was Caffe Bella Napoli, though I am a regular at many caf√©s up and down Commercial.) One visit to the Drive Coffee Bar is definitely more than enough for me. \\n\\nTEENSY REVIEW\\nClich√© caf√© with drab coffee. \\n\\nMEDIUM REVIEW\\nIf you like flatscreens in your face while you sip a mediocre cappuccino, this is the place for you. \\n\\nLONG-WINDED REVIEW\\nIt feels really generic in here, like if aliens decided to create a coffee habitat to lure humans. Decor: track lighting, gloomy interior with an awkward layout, and TVs on seemingly all the time (there were no playoffs on when I was there, just TVs playing random crap). But at least there were no non-consensual probes around when I was there, so perhaps the aliens didn't like the coffee either and left too. \\n\\nThe only good food here seems to be the exact same food you can find elsewhere. Like, I mean literally the exact same food. They sell the same beer snacks that Off the Rail and Strange Fellows have: pepperoni and cheesesticks. If I want a $6 cheesestick I'd better be drunk -- yes, it's still delicious sober but I feel better about it when I'm drinking. They use syrups for their chai and matcha. They sell Cartem's doughnuts. They sell sandwiches from the Italian deli a block away at 2nd & Commercial (La Grotta De Fromaggio -- it's easy enough for you and me to walk over there and get a fresh sandwich right?). The food they get from elsewhere seems to be more expensive here - but that's just markup I suppose.\\n\\nSpeaking of sandwiches, I don't know if they make the breakfast sandwich in-house, but it is inedible after they squish it into the griller -- it was like a breakfast puck with everything fused together. Maybe they should get someone else to make that for them too. Or maybe it *is* made by another company, and it's only killed on-site? \\n\\nI know the owners run a roaster, but this caf√© seems to have been created by people who have no clue about coffee culture -- whether you're judging by hipster or old skool Italian coffee criteria, this place is a massive FAIL. It's like some weird frankencaf√© that combines the bad bits of both traditional and third-wave aesthetics - dull beans + jacked up hipster prices. Nothing original, either in decor, food or coffee (on second thought, the coffee would probably taste better if they copied other caf√©s on the Drive more closely). And did I mention jacked-up prices? They're like 24-hour caf√© prices +15%. This is the Drive, not Kits. \\n\\nTea selection is good. Don't have the coffee unless you like disappointment. Let alone anything espresso-based. It pains me to tell you that a coffee brand some people named after my neighbourhood is disappointing. I love my neighbourhood. I love coffee too though. Man.\\n\\nThe baristas were nice. That made my experience more sad. I had to feel bad for me *and* for them. \\n\\nTo sum up this place is like its name - bland, generic, soulless. It will probably survive because of its prime location and search engine optimisation, but if you want to enjoy good coffee and atmosphere, and soak up Drive culture and community, there are tons of better caf√©s to choose from on Commercial.

We stopped by for lunch on a Saturday and was able to get a table within 5 minutes. It is a cute restaurant but a little confusing in table arrangements. One side of the restaurant feels like an actual small restaurant and one feels like tables on a random street in Bangkok. I do like the feel of the side table since it brings back many memories of Bangkok. \\n\\nFish Sauce Spicy Wings: I love this dish and I've made this dish multiple times but Pok Pok's is a bit overwhelming and pungent with the smell and salt. It was hard to eat it by itself and definitely need lots of rice to go along with it. We ordered some sticky rice for the table and it accompanied all the different things we ordered well. \\n\\nPapaya Salad: This dish actually need a bit more flavoring and spiciness\\n\\nDeep Fried Fish (talapia) with dipping sauces:  For $26, I find the fish and the sauces to be very ordinary. I can find this dish on any Vietnamese/Asian family dinner table. \\n\\nRotisserie Game Hen: My friends are not up for other adventurous things on the menu so we ordered this dish. I was excited for it until I realized that again the sauces include generic sweet and sour that might have come from a bottle.

We had linguine ala vongole ( my favvvvv dish), spaghetti with poplepettes and gnocchi. Linguine with clams would've tasted a whole lot better with some bottarga aka the dried grey mullets egg. I like it, not loved it. My pasta was overcooked. My friend's gnocchi was ok. I think the sauce killed it with too much salt. Spaghetti and meatballs was good but salty. Overall, it was a salty meal. We used tons of lemons and crush peppers to balance it out. \\n\\nThat being said, we tried coming here for dinner the night before and they had a 2 hour wait.

I don't belong to a religion that practices halal or kosher, but I always feel better eating halal or kosher meat.  From the restaurant's website it says, \\"the animal has been treated respectfully, in both life and death, and your food is 100% cruelty-free.\\" Also halal meat isn't cheap, and this restaurant has so far managed to keep their prices pretty low.

The host, Matt, actually apologized to us for a 30 minute wait. During prime brunch time! (11AM on Labor Day Monday)\\n\\nCafe Luna is a popular brunch place located in the heart of Central Square. Especially with their outdoor seating, it seems that the wait time can be quite long when the weather is nice. Inside, there is bar seating as well as at least 8-10 tables along the wall.\\n\\nThe menu is two full pages of awesomeness. We were so overwhelmed by their variety of sweet and savory choices, but ended up settling on classics: Poached eggs over Jalapeno Mac and Cheese with bacon, Lobster Eggs Benedict, Steak & Lobster Eggs Benedict, and the Avocado and Lobster Omelet. The Jalapeno Mac and Cheese was done very well, with the subtle spiciness hitting you at the end of the bite, and the bacon gave the dish a more three-dimensional flavor with its smokiness. The English muffins in the eggs benedicts were extremely tough and impossible to cut, and they sadly used the lobster claw meat in the benedicts. (We would have preferred the tail meat, but that's probably more expensive.) Also, the avocado in the omelet was merely guacamole instead of fresh avocado slices.\\n\\nOur server, Kim, was extremely sweet. She was enthusiastic and pleasant the entire time. They use an advanced mobile credit card payment system (\\"MIT technology\\"), but when they printed out our receipt, no tip was listed. Kim was confident she saw us select a tip, but when I checked my bank statement later, only the original amount was charged - so sorry! We're going to come back to give you that tip, and we hope all the wrinkles in your system get fixed!\\n\\nOverall, the cafe looks great on paper with a very ambitious menu, but the execution of the food can be improved.

And while the restaurant was beautiful, the view out the window of the Public Gardens was pretty, and service was friendly and attentive, I still have to knock Bistro du Midi for the food.  Portion sizes were small, and many of the dishes I tried were utterly average.  \\n\\nThe slow-cooked pork belly that I had as a starter was good but forgettable.  I tried a bit of the marinated beet salad (with goat cheese!) that my sister ordered, and it was tasty, but if you know me at all, you know that I find all beet salads to be fantastic.\\n\\nI was originally going to get the duck for my entree, but David ended up getting it instead.  When I tried some of it, I found myself glad that I didn't order it.  The lavender jus that it was flavored with was overpowering.  And the dish consisted of a measly 5 or so strips of meat!  I don't eat much, but I think I can manage more than that.\\n\\nInstead, I opted for the goat cheese gnocchi, which was good, but again, not good enough that I'll remember it 6 months from now.  The dish came topped with cauliflower, pine nuts, and a tasty spring pea sauce.  However, if I could do this meal over again, I'd order the grilled pork chop, which was hands-down the best entree I tried.\\n\\nFor dessert, I of course had to get the chocolate souffle.  This was my first-ever souffle, and I enjoyed it immensely.  Decadent, rich, and ridiculously filling, how can you go wrong?  But I am told that it was a bit more dense than souffles typically should be.\\n\\nI can't emphasize enough how beautiful and spacious the restaurant itself is.  We were seated in a particularly nice semi-private area with a great view, so 5 stars for that.  I had a couple cocktails in me and was too buzzed to realize it at the time (yes, I'm a lightweight), but the food had left me a little underwhelmed.

I am now so in love with Life Alive that I am organizing all of my social activities around it, no exaggeration. From the moment you open the door (either the one in front or the delightfully automatically-opening wheelchair-accessible one in back), you are treated to a calming vibe that slows your pulse and your breath. It is the most yogic restaurant I can name in the Boston area. I could feel my desire for caffeine draining out of me, and my need to fill up with other unhealthy combinations of C, H and O left me just as quickly. They sell something called the \\"dandy blend\\" that is a coffee substitute that I haven't tried yet, but I could sense a curiosity stirring. This is the sort of place that harkens back to my days in college co-ops and women's circles. The sort of place that Left Coast-centric types might assume only exists in the Bay Area. What a joy to prove them wrong.\\n\\nOthers have discussed the food already, so I won't go into great detail, except to say that each of the 'warm meals' seems so uniquely delightful that I've set it my goal to try them all. Plus a full juice bar and non-dairy smoothies? What's not to like?\\n\\nThe erstwhile Hollywood Express space has some wacky nooks and crannies on the basement floor (sadly NOT w/c-accessible, my only beef with the place) which the cafe has made inviting by filling with pillows and benches. They've included a lovely playspace for the kids down here, which makes it a haven for parents of a certain age.\\n\\nAnd one final bonus: while health and well-being are clearly high on the list of priorities, the folks at Life Alive are not above selling chocolate, too, so if you can't really break away from those old habits quite yet, you don't have to feel like you're being judged (unlike certain other Cambridge cafes that I have reviewed previously). \\n\\nOne more comment: this place actually snuck nutritional yeast into my \\"I-turn-my-nose-up-at-weird-food\\" bf without his complaining.

Overpriced in general and nothing outstanding... but maybe I made the wrong choices.\\n-the bread was very good: hearty and wheaty and a great counterpoint to the oysters.\\n-the oyster slider was good, on a sweet brioche, but I was disappointed by the size and low oyster:bread ratio\\n-fried cod cheeks were OK, but were a little cold and lacking texture when they came out, and the portion was SUPER small (about 6 mouthfuls) for $14.

Last year, I was pleasantly surprised to see the Vivi Bubble Tea sign come up for this new location on Buford Highway. It opened at the beginning of the year (January 2017).\\n\\nUnfortunately, at the time of writing this review, the teas I've had at this location haven't been as good as the teas I've had in New York. Vivi isn't the only chain where I've noticed significant inconsistencies in the quality and taste of bubble tea between locations. I've had similar experiences with Kung Fu Tea and Quickly, both inside and outside of Atlanta. Vivi Bubble Tea Atlanta hasn't been in business for a full quarter yet, so I'd give them some time to train staff and work the kinks out. There is definitely potential.\\n\\nIf this exact shop opened just about anywhere else in metro Atlanta, I might've rated them one star higher. However, and understandably so, these guys decided to open in the middle of a bubble tea and Asian bakery-cafe hotbed. You're talking stiff competition like Kung Fu Tea, Sweet Hut, and Tea House Formosa; two of which are a stone's throw away. My star rating is also relative to competition in the immediate area.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the Vivi brand is kawaii to the max. It's bright, vivid, and radiant with a lot of white, pink, and yellow. The company's mascots are girly cartoon skulls with anime eyes and long eyelashes. It's definitely a fun and unique look and I would bring people here just to check out the colorful decor and some of the crazy-looking drinks. The inside of the shop looks like the set of a J-pop or K-pop girl group music video. If anything, this place has its amusing color scheme and playful ambiance going for it.\\n\\nThere's a cotton candy machine at the counter where they make cotton candy to be served either by itself or with their Cotton Candy Milk Tea Series. If Vivi is trying to differentiate itself from the competition, the cotton candy drink is one of the attempts. The cotton candy drinks look huge and ridiculous. While eye-catching and great for wow factor and Instagram photos, these drinks essentially amount to bubble tea served with a fluffy cloud of cotton candy on top.\\n\\nThe staff does an amazing job with presentation. If dining in, a cotton candy drink order is served in not one, but two mason jars (one large, one small) atop a thick wooden bread board. Cotton candy engulfs the tea in the larger mason jar. What's the smaller mason jar for? Just more tea, topped with whipped cream. Cotton candy drinks cost $4.95 each and come in four milk tea flavors (black, matcha, tiramisu, taro). The cotton candy topping is berry-flavored and comes in light blue or pink. The cotton candy flavor is random unless you specify.\\n\\nI think the cotton candy drink is fun to order for the novelty, but it's not something I'd order regularly. It's also messy and sticky to eat because the cotton candy immediately starts melting and dripping and it gets stuck to your bubble tea straw. Realistically, these are two things that are meant to be consumed separately.\\n\\nAnother gimmicky drink on Vivi's menu is the Boba Bulb. These are teas that are served in glasses that look like light bulbs. Like the cotton candy drinks, the Boba Bulbs are neat because of their novelty. Only 50 Boba Bulbs are offered per day and they're sold at $5.50 a bulb, two flavors only: Classic (Earl Grey milk tea with honey boba) and Peach (peach green tea, Japanese jelly, and peach slices). I tried the classic and thought it was OK. Other than the distinctive look, it's not any different from ordering a standard bubble milk tea.\\n\\nMost drinks cost $4-5 each with no credit card minimum. Boba (tapioca) is free and other toppings are extra ($0.50 each).\\n\\nOther teas I've tried so far include the Red Moo (includes red bean), Mango Slush, Chocoberry N Cookie, Peach Ice Jelly, Strawberry Lemonjade, Japanese Matcha, and Strawberry Yakult. I liked the Matcha and strawberry Yakult (Japanese yogurt drink) the best. The Strawberry Lemonjade was sour and awful (very off-putting flavor). The Chocoberry and Peach Ice Jelly were both flowery and fragrant.\\n\\nBoba quality has been fresh. Vivi's boba is a bit chewier than the other shops' boba.\\n\\nThey serve snacks too. I've had the popcorn chicken ($5) and Taiwanese BBQ sausage ($2.50) and both are savory and tasty. The chicken comes in five flavors. The sausage is rich and sweet (recommended).\\n\\nService is excellent. Yao, manager Landy, and co-owner Mike are all great."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"So ENORMOUS!  It's nice they have maps.

After double-checking Yelp, reviews seem to back up their recommendations. \\n\\nI decided to come here on a Sunday night with my boyfriend, right after we did a full day of  exploring Boston on foot so we could really work up our appetites. We got here a little bit after 6PM and ended up waiting ~40-45 minutes for a table. Not the longest I've waited for food so I consider that time a success. Definitely easier when you're only a couple of people! There were groups of 4-6 people that were passed up for awhile until enough tables open up. \\n\\nWe got seated at the little corner table in front of window, which was private enough to talk without being interrupted by other patrons. It also offered the outside world a view of exactly what was being served to us! \\n\\nFor the FOOD, we ordered:\\n\\nFRIED CALAMARI -- got the small plate to start. Unlike other reviewers, I actually enjoyed the lightly breaded version they make here! It offers the chance for the squid to really shine. They perfectly fried the squid and had enough tenderness without being rubbery. It was good dipped in the marinara sauce, or just own its own with a dash of Tobasaco.\\n\\nSICILIAN STYLE MUSSELS -- I was so excited when I saw our waitress bring us a bowl piled high with shells. I could smell the fragrant lemon & garlic broth as she headed over to our table.The mussels were fresh, sweet, and the flavor was enhanced by the lemon and garlic. It was simple and tasty! Customers in line outside were definitely eyeing us as we chowed down on this.\\n\\nAGLIO OLIO -- Appetizer size of this portion since got another entree size pasta to share as well. Definitely happy I listened to Yelpers and ordered this! Squid ink pasta was perfectly cooked and al dente. The olive oil and garlic sauce was heavenly...I could smother myself in it. There was also a generous amount of ground squid with the pasta. I had extra to scoop up in bread and to mix with our second pasta dish.\\n\\nCLAMS & CALIMARI COMBO PASTA W/ WHITE SAUCE -- Another great pasta dish that satisfied my carb cravings. Both the clams and calimari were extra fresh and paired well with the white butter/olive oil sauce. I took the garlic and ground squid mixture of the other dish and mixed with this one for an even better flavor combo. \\n\\nFor a DRINK, I got myself a glass of CHARDONNAY. Pretty funny to drink it out of a clear plastic cup, but I liked the vibe of this cute little Italian place. \\n\\n$120 later (food + tax + tip), we left happy, full, and satisfied!

The heat from the spice wasn't overpowering but provided enough of a punch.  We also got the beef with scallions which was solid (beef a bit chewy) but didn't compare to the spicy Sichuan specialities.  We only spent 30$ and had some leftovers.

Barcelona is no longer the nicest place the block! Dinner here really feels like a treat, even though it's not *that* much more expensive than other good sushi places in town. \\n\\nThere are two issues our party had that prevent me from giving MF five stars... \\n\\nFirst, the hostess did not warn us that they didn't have a liquor license yet. Luckily, we could get wine down the street at the market. I understand that new restaurants may not yet be able to serve alcohol, but this absolutely should be stated over the phone to people who call in advance for reservations. I'm sure this won't be an issue in the future, but until they get that license they should make a point to inform their guests ahead of time.\\n\\nSecond, some of the food took forever to get to our table. Two of us ordered rolls, which took a reasonable 20 minutes, but someone else ordered the filet mignon and it took 90 minutes. The filet doesn't even come cooked - you saut√© it yourself over a flame at the table (admittedly it was delicious). So, an hour and a half for raw meat to get to the table. I totally understand that sushi restaurants serve food as it becomes ready, but this was a seriously huge disconnect between the sushi chefs and the rest of the kitchen. My poor friend was starving by the time his food came out. I felt like the filet should have been comped, or perhaps they should have offered us dessert (although not an after-dinner drink, since there was no liquor license). \\n\\nI hope these are just kinks that will be worked out as this new restaurant's staff finds steadier footing, because MF has all the makings of an amazing place... a true destination.

The small portions would not have been such a disappointment if the price tag weren't so huge.

The main reason is that the meal prep/service is disorganized. This is on par with most hippie/hipster restaurants I've gone to (like Veggie Galaxy.) It's okay if you go on a Tuesday at 10am, but if you go around mealtimes or at all on the weekend it turns into a giant cluster. \\n\\nSometimes people equate the fact that this place is always crowded or \\"the line is always out the door\\" to the food being so popular. While this is partially true, I'm pretty sure the line is always out the door because they often have one person ringing people up and answering the phone during a rush. Otherwise, they may have the same amount of customers but the line would seem more manageable because everyone was in and out in a more reasonable time. If this doesn't make sense to you think about the ticket line at the museum of science. Busy place, but the line isn't too long because they get you in and out like they're a well organized machine. \\n\\nIf you still want to go, they let you call your order in. If it's a busy time expect being put on hold or your phone order taking precedence over a poor slob in line's order. Sad face. You can bypass the line this way but it's kinda hilarious because there isn't a marked space for phone orders to stand and wait so often the phone order people cut each other in their own mini line by the side of the cash register.

For a BBQ place they have all of the normal goodies: Pulled pork, brisket, spare & baby back ribs & chicken. They also have pork belly which is something you don't typically find and I was excited to see (Pork belly must be the new bacon b/c it's popping up everywhere). You have the option of getting 1, 2 or 3 meat plates. None of the meats are served w/sauce. \\n\\nEach meat place comes with 2 sides. For sides they, again, have your typical stuff:Mac & Cheese, collards, baked beans, fries. They do put their own twist on some items such as the baked beans being cooked with molasses which gives the beans a sweet flavor. \\n\\nI had the 2 meat plate. Sadly they ran out of pork belly (argh!), so I settled with the baby back ribs and pulled pork. The rub on the ribs was really good. You can definitely tell they were smoked with the nice pink ring around the meat (hence the restaurant name). The pulled pork was also well cooked, but I wish it was pulled a little more. I'm not a fan of having to use a knife to cut my pulled pork. \\n\\nThey have 3 different BBQ sauces you can add: vinegar based, tomato based, and some weird mayonnaise based sauce from Alabama. Not a fan of vinegar based sauces in general, but it was ok. Tomato wasn't bad. The two mixed together was actually pretty good. The mayo sauce was wack; what's wrong with people in Alabama? Yeah, BBQ sauce selection was the weakest point of my meal. \\n\\nI ordered the mac & cheese and baked beans as my sides. Mac & cheese was EXCELLENT. Just the right about of cheesiness. The baked beans weren't bad either, but wasn't blown away. I would definitely order the mac & cheese again, but can live w/o the baked beans. \\n\\nPrices are about the same as Heirloom BBQ. $15 for 2 meat plate (Heirloom is $16). Though I do think you get a little more meat at Heirloom.  They have a lot more on the menu I want to try such as the burger, pulled pork sandwich, and pork belly.\\n\\nThey have a brunch menu too which looks interesting.\\n\\nYou can either park on the street on Nelson St or the buildings parking garage off of Chapel St. There's also a $2, cash only parking lot of Elliot St. I wouldn't bother coming here when the Falcons are playing at home.

Last night for a family birthday dinner we ordered multiple dinners and sides through the online app. The app placed the order correctly but I should note it wants to add a tip prior to you getting your order so in this case I got taken. \\n\\nIt was 7:00 pm on a Friday and they were out of eggplant and linguini. This is not the first time we have ordered and they have been out of what I would think is a basic item for an Italian restaurant. The online system does not indicate what they are out of. When we picked up the food in multiple bags we were assured by the young man that he double checked everything and that we were all set. I made the mistake of trusting him and for the sake of time, since this was a large order, we picked up our order and headed home. Once we got home and unpacked the bags we found that we had been shorted an entire meal. I called back and after the phone was handed around to several different people on their end they days that they made the meal but had no idea where it went. I'm suspicious of that statement because we they reviewed the order that was supposed to have linguini in it, they now said that they were out of linguini. They made a replacement meal, but of course we had to select another pasta. I made a return trip and picked up the meal. Back at home everyone else waited for me to return before they ate so we had 6 lukewarm meals and one hot meal. \\n\\nThe frustration is two fold, one, this is not the first time that we have gotten incorrect orders to bring home.

It has great authentic Northern African food.  I have tried almost every dish on their very limited menu, pretty much everything is good.  It is difficult to go wrong on any dishes on the menu.  That being said, I still want to stress that their lamb dishes are great, as are their appetizers.  I don't usually like sour stuff, but I just cannot pass its lemonade---a must have---even if you don't like sour stuff or lemonade.  Dessert menu is very limited, but certain still maintains high quality.\\n\\nThe environment is sooo homey and intimate.  If fact, if you have a group large than 4, they can hardly fit you with comfortable seating.  So, it is great if you want to just bring a couple of friends along, but certainly not for a big crowd.  The ambience is warm and authentic.  They didn't try too hard to decorate, but that is actually the beauty of it, less pretentiousness and a little bit more of homey feeling.  The entire restaurant is so small, probably only seats 20 people the most at a time, and the kitchen is even smaller, only has about 2 chefs working the most.  Unless you go early (5 or 6pm for dinner) or on week nights, it is almost certain that you have to wait, both for a table and for food.  But still, I keep going back even though half of the time I had to wait.  \\n\\nThe staff had very unique personality.  The first time I went there, I didn't enjoy it much because the owner was a little loud (and it was very much amplified in a small restaurant).  But as I went there a couple more times, I began to love this place and its staff.  The owner is actually a very warm woman and yes, she sometimes talks a little bit more, but she does treat you more like a friend.  Because of that, she is more straightforward and expresses herself more than your typical restaurant owner.  She did not try too hard to please you, but I actually enjoy her straightforward friendliness.  The dinning experience there is more like going back to your hometown and eating at a restaurant you grew up with, even if this is your first time to go dine there.

There was nothing outstanding about the dish, but I was hungry so I finished it. The waitress was absent for most of the time, so asking for anything took a long while. The only time she was quick was taking back my father's plate that had a hair in the mashed potatoes. The hair wasn't even short, it was a long piece... how do you not see that? We were disgusted. (Note that this was the second time this has happened to us here). The first time, however, we were offered sincere apologies and a free dessert form the manager.

The only positive Pok Pok had to offer was a very patient waiter. \\n\\nThe two hostesses should work in the middle of Manhattan, not Portland. Wait, that is a putdown of restaurants in Manhattan, they belong in a snotty, unfriendly restaurant in Manhattan. I've never been treated this way in Manhattan. We were informed a 30- to 45-minute wait. I don't believe the woman even looked me in the eye once. Therefore, that explains why even though we were standing maybe 10 feet from her the entire time we waited, she didn't bother to call out to me when I didn't hear the text come in. Instead, after about an hour, I checked out progress to which the other snob responded, \\"We texted you 9 minutes ago.\\" No apology, no hurrying around to get us seated. I had to ask (because I really was not sure), if a table was still available. The head snob then responded, \\"In a few minutes\\". Then we proceeded to wait another 10 minutes. \\n\\nOur table was literally abutted to another couple's table. That worried me until I realized it was so loud in there, we would barely be able to hear ourselves, let alone them. Was not a problem although I felt sorry for my friend. At least I had a post between myself and the other party. \\n\\nIf the food was fantastic, all this wouldn't have mattered one bit. It was not. The descriptions were all very detailed and very interesting, but to me, nothing was any different than anything I've had better at other Thai restaurants. \\n\\nAll the portions were so small, I probably could have eaten the entire three courses myself. Salad was mostly shredded carrots and cabbage, dressing was nothing different from anything I've ordered at other Thai or Vietnamese restaurants, lime based. It was fine. \\n\\nPork skewers were so grossly overcooked, getting the meat off the skewers was an ordeal. I had to use my hands to wrestle them off. That is the correct verb to use. Took at least 2 minutes to jam it off, and then it slid onto my plate and almost knocked my salad right off. Peanut sauce was extremely watery. Served with 4 tiny, 1-inch bread squares. Maybe two tablespoons of cucumber salad with that. \\n\\nCurry noodles were just this side of mushy. Broth was tasty as long as you like coconut milk.  For condiments for two people: one lime wedge, maybe a tablespoon of pickled greens (Mustard, maybe? I liked those, too bad there was barely enough for a child), maybe 1/4 tsp of very hot chopped pepper concoction (which was about right because it was really hot, fun!) and some other bits that I couldn't even identify because they were so small.\\n\\nDid not go expecting a meal like other \\"standard\\" Thai restaurants.

Nana nana boo boo, no corn for you foo) and with 2 drinks each, our total came to $103. And for fucks sake, tip 20%. If you don't, you're either a real douche-pon, or your server did something completely shitty, and that just doesn't happen there.

Hvnt been here for few years but the last time we went there for dinner. We remembered the food was quite good and service was great too.  Their waiter used to wear these traditional Thai clothes which we thought made the atmosphere a bit unique. Anyways, I guess they changed their dress code for all the waiter now. No more traditional Thai clothes, most of the waiter yesterday was wearing short black skirts and revealing tops kinda like Cautcus Club etc........ \\n\\nMy husband and I sat down while waiting for he rest of my party to arrive. One of the waiter pulled us water but accidentally knocked the entire glass of water on me. I know it was an accident but honestly I did not feel like they were very apologetic.

We ordered probably the typical Thai dishes, Pad Thai, Pad see, papaya salad, tom yum soup, panang etc.  to share...\\n\\nWhen my husband made the reservation, he asked the cost of the corkage fee and we were told it was $15 which seems pretty fair. But when we took out our wine in the restaurant, the waiter told us corkage fee was $20. It would be good to train all the staff so they provide the correct information to all customers. It's only $5 so we didn't say anything more. \\n\\nAs the food arrives, we constantly ask for either another wine glass, additional plates or bowls so we can eat. But everytime we asked each waiter, seems like they just want to ignore us. One waiter even came back and ask us rudely what do we want? The impression we all got was they did not want to serve us at all. Is it a little too much trouble to ask for another plate? Or bowl? No!! Yesterday night was the most horrible service experiences we have ever had.  \\n\\nOne more thing, they also missed two of our orders but they never informed us or even ask us if we want to wait.

The tortillas.... Geez, the tortillas. Maybe the best tortillas I've ever had. House made..... just... delicious. Taco was better than Dan's. (won't compare to Caf√© Java because the bacon is added differently) So amazing.\\n\\nCFC was so tender... tender and juicy, huge portions, maybe best CFC we have ever had. Mashed potatoes delicious, Mac & Cheese also some of the best we've ever had. \\n\\nBacon burger Peter said was really, really good. He ordered medium and thought it might be SLIGHTLY too medium... but he will eat some bloody, bloody beef so this was really nothing to him. He did say he might ask med-well next time. I did not try it because although I love a med to med-rare steak, I'm weird with any kind of pink ground beef. (I saw a review where someone thinks the meat may have gotten them sick - despite the cook, again just a bit off, P was not sick whatsoever.)\\n\\nOnion rings were delicious and actually had flavor. \\n\\nWe ordered 10 tortillas to go - you don't understand how delicious these tortillas are. Wish we would have asked for them to be wrapped as 5 & 5 because they were so fresh that they stuck together a bit.\\n\\nEverything we ordered was under $30 before tip .... I cannot believe that the food is this good, portions this big, and prices this cheap.\\n\\nAll of the staff was so kind. I asked a nice girl who owned the place and she pointed to a gentleman who had walked in mid meal. He was having a salad and I ...  (I don't know why) liked the fact that he pointed out a slight issue with the way his onion was cut - he sure is committed, so it seems, to presenting a perfect plate.\\n\\nWe got up and started to walk out and the gentleman owner wished us well. We told him it was delicious; a really lovely place. He asked where we came from (north north Austin), he said wow, long drive, and we said yes but we will be back - many many times.\\n\\nAnd, fwiw, as we walked down the steps, 2-3 cars pulled up and people started filing in, I guess for their nightly rush.\\n\\nThank you yelpers, for showing us this place."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"yummy moist brisket, amazing creamed corn, but most of all, fun environment!  :-)  Loved sitting on the picnic tables on the patio, drinking from a bottle, eating off waxed paper, and just generally enjoying the experience."},{"name":"Smoke Ring","address":"309 Nelson St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food in a fantastic environment.

The food was not great but not bad. The appetizers were good. Some veggie egg rolls that were nicely cooked, not too greasy and served with a good sweet and sour sauce, and some chicken satay which was good but the peanut sauce served with it was less than flavor full. My dish, ordered mild, could have used a little spice but wasn't bad. My friends sushi was very good (mmm spicy tuna roll). My other friends mild curry dish was very good as well. The Thai ice tea was excellent. \\nAll in all, not too shabby. I was not overly impressed but would be willing to return and give it a second chance.

My friend and I got there pretty early for dinner (a little before 5:00) and we were able to find street parking about as close as it gets. When we walked in the restaurant was practically empty and we were seated promptly. We were right in front of the open kitchen which I thought was pretty neat! I really loved the vibe in the restaurant, it felt very open and bright. \\nI was pretty impressed by the food. After asking our waitress for recommendations I ordered a watermelon mojito. She told me it was a new special and that I would love it. Wow, was she right! Go get one of these while they have them! We split an order of the edamame dumplings which I read were a must. They were definitely tasty, but not \\"to die for, I have to order them again\\" tasty. For entrees I got the seabass and my friend got the teriyaki quinoa bowl with shrimp. Mine was very good, but I liked the quinoa bowl better and will probably get that next time. The seabass was cooked perfectly and was even a little crispy which I liked. The snap peas were a great compliment flavor wise. My only complaint is the umami sauce. It was delicious but it's a strong flavor so I wish there would have been just a little less of it. My friends quinoa bowl was awesome, the grain really absorbed the teriyaki flavor, more than I though it would. She offered to let me have her left overs and I was thrilled but then we forgot them and I was heart broken. \\nOur server was wonderful and so helpful. The food also came out much quicker than I was expecting. My only issue with True Food Kitchen is the price. Our total check was about $85, not including tip.

The Philly Seitan, a nice warm toasty sub with wheat gluten, cashew cheese (spread), grilled onions and peppers, was a delicious combination of all things hippie being served on a soft wheat bun.  The mango and red pepper quinoa is a bit bland, so opt for the kale and carrot caesar salad.  Earthy and not too heavy on the dressing, this salad is a good compliment to the nice Philly.\\n\\nThe raw bruschetta was definitely the most unique food substance I've had in quite some time...  The bread at the bottom was a bound mixture of seeds and some other things...  no flour, no gluten.  Very nutty and fresh tasting.  On top was some of that good ol' cashew spread, some fresh tomatoes and basil.  Besides the unique \\"toast\\" at the bottom, the components would be better off non-vegan...

My boyfriend and I went to Thailand last year and I instantly got flashbacks to the local restaurants we ate at while over there. From the plastic table covers to the small plates and plastic cups, I felt like I re-experienced a little bit of our Thailand trip during our meal.  Now to the noms:\\n\\n* Chang beer: Ooooh reunited and it felt so good!  This Thai beer was all we drank when we were in Thailand and I've been having trouble finding it in the States.  THANK YOU!\\n* Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: For those of you saying that these were really salty, have you had fish sauce before?  Knowing what I was getting into, we ordered these non-spicy and they were packed full of amazing flavor.  I've never had anything like this before. love, love, LOVE salty food, but they're also paired with a bunch of pickled vegetables that help even out the flavor.  It's also great with the coconut rice if you need to dilute it a little more.  You get six large wings with this order, perfect for 3 people.\\n* Khanom Jiin Kaeng Khiaw Waan (vermicelli with green curry and fish balls): This was a lot spicier than I thought it was going to be, but delicious nonetheless.  Definitely needed some water to go with it, but all the flavors came together, especially with the dried fish, pickled garlic, and egg they had on the side.  Avoid the seeds and you should be fine with the spice level.  Paired really well with the coconut and jasmine rice.\\n* Kaeng Hang Leh (sweet pork belly/shoulder curry):  Meat that melts in your mouth! SO DELICIOUS! And AMAZING with jasmine rice.  I'm a rice + sauce person, so I could literally eat all this in one sitting if someone didn't stop me.\\n* Serving sizes: Meant to be served family style, so all this food was a LOT for two people, but we really wanted to get a little bit of everything.  :)  Ultimately, this would have been a perfect amount for three people.  But we took our leftovers to go and devoured it after a good local hike.\\n\\nWould I recommend this place?  To PDX visitors:  Yes.  Definitely.  I'm so glad that someone told me it was essentially a staple.  As a visitor, you have the luxury of going at non-peak times.  Do it.\\n\\nAfter reading through a lot of the negative parts of reviews, these are the cons I gathered: line is long, place is dingy/run down, and food is salty.  My rebuttals and responses to that are:\\n\\n* Line: totally get this; order to-go or try coming during non-peak if you can.  Still worth the try, but may be hard to get in with a large group.\\n* Ambiance: go to Thailand (or look it up) and you'll understand why this place is designed the way it is.  I LOVE IT.  Don't ever change. \\n* Salty: This is the nature of the food.  I truly believe the flavors here are unique, vivid, and completely worthwhile.  Know what you're getting into when you come and be open to what you'll be tasting."},{"name":"MF Sushi Atlanta","address":"299 N Highland Ave NE, Ste K","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It has been years since we last visited MF Sushi (it was still on Ponce the last time we went so a lot has happened between then and now)--but we remembered how wonderful it was back then and went for dinner on Friday night with those expectations.

I like an upbeat atmosphere, and it definitely had that, but talking was nearly impossible.  Service was solid, but the pace of the meal was perhaps a little too quick.  Don't get me wrong--I like for my food to come out quickly, but it really felt like they were just trying to turn tables--it's a small space.     \\n\\nFood: The food is still very good, but it didn't blow us away like it did in the past, with one exception: The sea bass was absolutely amazing.  If you go, you must order this.  The rest of the apps, sushi, rolls, etc. were all good, but nothing that really stood out.  Also--if you order the avocado ball, you should know that it is tiny!!  It looks like a good sized app when you see the pictures online, but in person, it is the size of about two pieces of sushi.

Venue seems a touch rundown, construction around the exterior conf center entrances impeded an easy access.  During lunch, the roof in the Coquina Ballroom started to leak on us.  It was raining cats and dogs, but still, unless it's Irma all over again, I expect the roof to be sound enough for an afternoon shower.  Lunch was plated service.  Salads were plated by staff into individual bowls.  My salad was half the portion of my neighbors' salads, was that a hint I should eat less? Maybe.  Entree was your standard \\"banquet chicken,\\" you know, dry, rock hard, tepid.  This one was wrapped with prosciutto and stuffed with some kind of garlicky forcemeat.  The Demi-glac√© was very salty, the meat was very bland.  A slice of roasted fennel was interesting, but chewy, a single carrot and 2 zucchini sticks seemed a little stingy and def not a healthy protein-starch-veg ratio.  Polenta triangle was OK, also under-seasoned, and flavored with, not my fave, canned pimientos.  Dessert was a choice of massive 1-inch thick, 5-inches across cookies.  They were grand to look at, but not very good (as evidenced by the numbers of half cookies thrown away).  My peanut butter cookie was pretty much raw dough through the middle.

Once you enter the restaurant, you instantly get a waft of the gas from the stoves which was a bit annoying.  After a while, the aroma of the food did overtake it so I forgot about it.  Because the restaurant is small, it felt cozy and warm with the decor and the dimly lit lights.  Definitely a place for a first date.  \\n\\nAfter looking over the menu, I ordered their signature drink, Cherbat and we decided on the Zaatar Coca (flat bread with caramelized onions) as an appetizer.

The different spices definitely came through with each bite.  For our entrees, I chose the Melfouf La Kasbah and the bf chose the Melkha.  Both our entrees were good.  Nothing to rave about.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try out other dishes on the menu.  I will have to say that the Cherbat was very good.

I opted for the Raw Butternut Tacos ($13) which came with two sides; I picked the Mixed Greens and the BBQ Jackfruit and Beans.\\n\\nThe tacos tasted very fresh, and the collard green leaves were a good substitute for tortillas. The \\"pastrami\\" didn't taste like meat but was enjoyable nonetheless. I wouldn't mind ordering either entree again. We enjoyed all the sides, but my favorite was the Jackfruit and Beans, which was as good as a traditional rice and beans dish.\\n\\nFor dessert, we each got a Brownie Bite ($2 each), which were made with cacao powder and almond flour and sweetened with dates. These literally were just one bite. I liked the sweetness from the dates, but the brownies tasted a little powdery due to the cocoa powder.\\n\\nFor a die-hard vegan, this place would be the perfect comfort food joint.

If you want BBQ, you have to let them know before you're seated so that they seat you at a table with a gas grill and vent. The waitstaff will also help you with grilling.

Food, of course, was excellent, and we had a surplus to bring home. The facilities are really nice with one exception.\\n\\nThe party was in mid-April, and there was 55 people in the room. This caused the temperature to climb pretty quickly. All they could do for us is turn the heat off and open a door. The manager didn't want to turn the AC on. That was rather frustrating. At first we had the front doors open, which lead into the main dining area. We were told if we open those doors that we'd have to lower our music and be quieter... That wasn't going to happen with this crowd. Eventually, one of the staff opened the back door, which ended up helping a lot. It was really uncomfortable for about the first hour, hour and a half. I wish they had thought of the heat aspect sooner. I can't imagine we were the first party that was hot.\\n\\nI received many compliments from the party goers about how this party felt more like a wedding reception than a birthday party. To me, that's a great success! I would give Focaccia a 5 star rating, except for the heat issue. I'm a firm believer a business needs to fully cater to their customers, regardless of their own bills.

And it's too bad, because the menu and atmosphere are excellent.

That being said, they make their own ice cream and sorbet, and it's so dope. I took a friend there for her birthday and it was just the perfect place to give her a fun, memorable meal and overall experience. I didn't even call ahead to mention we were celebrating a birthday, we just mentioned it offhand while ordering dessert, and the staff wound up giving us such extra special treatment to help celebrate, for no extra cost (delicious birthday shots, a cute candle in my friend's ice cream dish, and some additional ice cream and sorbet flavors we hadn't ordered for us to try)--the service is prompt and thoughtful, which means a lot at a place that's ALWAYS totally packed (don't try to just stroll into this place unless you love waiting forever, by the way).

The soft boiled egg was also perfect!!  I think if I didn't have the pork bun, I wouldve been a little disappointed that the ramen came with only one piece of meat and it wasn't pork belly either.

The seafood tasted really fresh and the lobster was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nI was getting full but wanted to eat their lobster roll.  It is expensive compared to other places.  The price was $27 I believe.  It came with coleslaw and kettle chips.  The lobster meat was really good but is it worth the money?

The cheese barely encased all of the runny beanage into the tortilla. Also, the staff doesn't seem to be very attentive or driven to take care of the customers... I asked for corn tortillas, and both of mine were put on flour.\\n\\nFortunately, the flour tortillas were nicely charred, and the potatoes in my taco boasted a soft starchiness.

I'd like to say we had a Banner time at the conference; unfortunately, we did--and that's an inside running joke--which is why Moonshine was so very necessary.\\n\\nMoonshine was one of three places I recommended, and, apparently, one of the in-room guide books at the Sheraton praised it highly, so the two ladies in our group latched immediately.  (Note to self: Forget agonizing over analyzing Yelp reviews from now on.  Just pick up one of the hotel rags, close your eyes, point, and nod your head knowingly.)  So off we went in the Navy Blue Durango-of-Peril, doing uweys (if not donuts) on Red River to screech up to the valet parking at Moonshine as if we were trying to beat closing time.\\n\\n\\"The valet opens at 5\\" we were told at 4:50 PM.  The hostess graciously took Danica Patrick's keys--no doubt in an attempt to save countless lives--and seated us immediately.\\n\\nWe chose to sit outside, and, fortunately it was still April, so Austin's heat-seeking missiles of summer torture were not yet fully deployed.  It was actually quite a comfortable experience on their covered patio, and Moonshine had backup fans and misters at the ready just in case.  Kudos to them for being locked and loaded for Austin's climatological nightmares.\\n\\nEveryone except the DD partook of libations, yes, even your humble observer-reviewer.  I chose the Shot of Moonshine as my unwind.  The Brit ordered a round of the beer battered asparagus, which set off a round of obvious conversation concerning recent scientific discoveries related to aspartic acid, initiated by yours truly.  Moonshine offered up seemingly endless baskets of complimentary popcorn to tide us over until the food arrived (more on this subject later).\\n\\nDinner was ordered, and three of us hung with the jalape√±o hanger steak with jalape√±o scallion butter, while another ordered the chicken fried steak with chipotle cream gravy.  All steaks were cooked as ordered, and the hanger steaks were memorably tender and delicious.  I savored the pepper and secretly longed for another.  Conversation dragged as we stuffed our steak holes...\\n\\nA second round of merriment was ordered mid-meal as we contemplated how to cap off the evening.  I switched to the delicious Silvermoon Margarita.  It was decided by the group that a movie was in order, so I suggested \\"Salmon Fishing in The Yemen\\" at the Violet Crown.\\n\\nAlong about this time, our waiter asks if we need anything. At least two popcorn refills had already been provided, but we jokingly said more popcorn--to go!  A few minutes later, our waiter delivers our checks, along with a gigantic bag of popcorn to go, compliments of the house.  Now that's what I call service--excellent all-around--and not centered on this singular event alone.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I didn't get to tag along with the group, as an unexpected situation deterred me.  But, to tell the truth, for those who did go, apparently Moonshine wasn't the only star attraction of the evening.\\n\\nI'll be back, Moonshine.

So two items fell flat for us, the Shrimp Crunch Roll did not crunch at all and it seemed like it was breaded in cruched cookies and it came off as sweet at times and not crisp like I imagined and the Volcano Roll was just a mess, it was a sushi roll covered in a shrimp/crawfish/veggie mix that just destroyed the rolls below and did not add anything but luke warm to cold veggie to the experience.  I would not order either of these ever again.  They just did not do it for me, they were edible but not desirable.  But the Shrimp Tempura Roll was a pleasant suprise and was the cheapest of all the rolls with eight pieces for 3.25.  It held up well, had a cruch and firm texture and just tasted good.

The Kaya Yucantan black bean dip is like no other bean dip we've ever had. Served with hearty-crisp multi-color chips. They can cater to just about anyone, even the vegans with their vegan cheeses. Our all-time favorite dish is the Gobbleritto, we even stop by when they bring it back in April for one day! But now that I'm vegetarian I have to substitute out the turkey (and the gravy). I had them stuff it with their seasonal vegetable, butternut squash, and I just about lost my mind; it was so good. Also, service is usually very good but we've definitely had our new servers, but they are always hiring nice people so it's never bad-attitude service. Recently there was a slip up on our appetizer order and the manager came to us personally to apologize and comp'd our entire order. This is the kind of customer appreciation you can come to expect from Mad Mex! Also, amazing margaritas with seasonal flavors and always so many great local craft beers constantly rotating. We've been to some very nice places in Columbus, but Mad Mex is and probably will always be our favorite place in the entire city."},{"name":"Marcello's at Emory","address":"1540 Ave Pl, Ste B280","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This restaurant is nice inside although it was nearly empty.

There is nothing like an empty restaurant to provide that \\"this isn't going to be good\\" feeling.\\n\\nIf a restaurant has great food, people will overlook everything else. They even wrote a Seinfeld episode around this truth (the abusive soup restaurant episode). But the food here is not good, at least the baked dishes. \\n\\nThree of us had baked dishes (lasagna & ziti) which came out VERY quickly and were clearly heated up. One of us had a dish that was barely warm in the center. Their Caesar salad was something you could easily pick up at Hartsfield Airport: dry tasteless romain strips, buried in spoonfuls of pre-grated Parmesan cheese from a food supply company, accompanied by purchased dressing on the side. The garlic bread was white bread sliced diagonally, smothered in oil, and sprinkled with a garlic powder and spice mixture. Everything tasted like it was from Sysco or US Foods. Nothing tastes fresh and everything was over salted.\\n\\nThe bill for all three of us, including tip, was $65.

The food is decent, the coffee is fine, and select members of the staff are awesome. It's right down the street from my work so I was frequenting this place at least once or twice a week. \\n\\nMaybe a month or so after going there regularly, and after they hired new staff I realized this place wasn't all it was cracked up to be. I was sitting at the low counter by the window and overheard a conversation between a customer and employee. The customer asked what food the employee recommended and the employee told him he honestly didn't eat there and that there was better fresher food down the street, and gave him recommendations. I do admire his honesty with the customer, but from my point of view, eating this overpriced $8 sandwich and then hearing there was fresher, better food down the street made me feel a little gypped. Why would you serve food that your own employees wouldn't recommend eating? You might as well just not serve food at all and stick to coffee if that's the case.\\n\\nAnother occasion, I walk in and they are quite busy (as usual) and wait in line for over ten minutes trying to get an iced coffee, which takes all of two seconds to prepare without ever being greeted, however the staff would look up and acknowledge my presence several times. I have a 30 min lunch break so I expect to get an order in within 10 minutes of my arrival so that I have time to enjoy my coffee and chill out before having to go back into the office. I got so tired of waiting I abruptly walked out the front door and crossed the street to Elaine's Pork and Pie where I got the same quality coffee for nearly half the price. That was pretty much the end of me going to Thunderbird.\\n\\nI do have to say, that their honey nut latte is very good. The le raymond and salmon sandwich are good as well, despite what their own employee said. As I mentioned earlier, they are a tad overpriced, and how they serve customers is a little weird. It's basically whoever you order with makes your coffee or sandwich and sometimes they just leave the register unattended trying to prepare the folks in front of you order. I think they would benefit from having someone always attending the register during rush hours. Also their thai iced coffee is good as well, but she explained to me what was in it and it sounded more like iced coffee and condensed milk. She didn't mention any other ingredients or seem to have any real knowledge of what it was. \\n\\nOverall this place is a nice atmosphere for meeting up with friends for a quick drink, but I would not make this your go to coffee shop, nor give them tons of your money or time unless they change things up.

I am sorry we did. To be fair, we might have hit an \\"off\\" night but our night out was a total disappointment. We arrived at 5:15 and while the door was open we kind of got the impression that they were still closed. Only one person in the kitchen that we could see, we were not greeted in any fashion and instead just took a table by the window and waited. Finally my partner called out to the guy in the kitchen to ask if they were in fact ready to customers and he nodded yes. That gentleman then came out and gave us our menus and walked away. There was no background music and in fact, only the constant and loud rings of their telephone, which he was not answering. Anyhow, we decided to start with an appetizer of spring rolls but when the fellow came back to the table I had a question and it became very clear that he did not actually speak English, and I wasn't even sure if he actually understood me either. At that point we were really tempted to just leave but we were pretty keen on having Thai food and I know, from the past, it was extremely good so we were hopeful it would turn around. Shortly thereafter another person came on shift and came to the table to take our orders. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, my partner ordered a beef dish and he also ordered a side sauteed tiger prawns. I had a diet Coke and he had a Vancouver Island Beer. I reiterated my appetizer order as I still wasn't confident the first fellow actually understood that I wanted it. Anyhow, those arrived after our waiter bellowed out to the kitchen something that we didn't understand. The rolls were good, not too greasy and well stuffed with goodies. A short time later our food arrived .. ugh. My Pad Thai was terrible, it was greasy and while the flavour was okay it certainly did not measure up to my past experience. His dinner was - ummm, interesting. He had ordered a sauteed beef kind of dish and a side of tiger prawns. Do you know there were only 3 tiger prawns! That certainly can't be considered a side of them? He did say the beef was tasty and definitely tender but there was so little of it for the price. I expect that in a fine dining place but certainly not in a casual type of place in New Westminster. Anyhow, we ate our meals (or I ate as much as I could of mine) and then we ordered dessert to share. We ordered the banana and it was good although it could have been cooked a wee bit longer. In the end we promptly left after paying our bill, which was $81. That seemed ridiculously high considering 1) the service, or lack thereof, 2) the type of venue and 3) the serious lack of food for my partner ... I mean, really, 3 tiger prawns and his dish was how much?\\nSo after considerable debate, I would have to say I could not recommend this place for the price. I would if it were more of a casual kind of priced place ... sure, take the chance, but at the price we paid I can't say it is worth the risk.

My main issue was that each dish seemed to be lacking in one area or another.  The Chicken & Biscuits was huge, but the gravy was a little bland and the biscuits were cold, which really took away from the overall richness.  The chilaquiles were good, but missing the traditional cheesiness that is generally considered its trademark.  They added some black beans, which really just made it denser.

I asked to get it without avocado because that just sounded strange on a list of fruit (I know avocado is a fruit but on my taste palette it isn't!). The guy told me he could do it but the consistency wouldn't be the same but I wouldn't really taste it. All right, he must know better than me and if I can't taste it who cares? It all tasted great and he was right! The portion was huge and so filling, not like those Sweetgreen places who feed you a bunch of grass with a teaspoon of some of the good stuff. Anyways, I hope this place does well. One thing I do regret getting is having the peanut butter. Everything goes together unless you have peanut butter in it. The texture just doesn't compliment the rest so next time I won't be adding that, or maybe get it on the side since they just glob a bunch of it on top and it's hard to avoid it.

However, the times they are a changing and Castleberry Hill is no longer a magnet for drug lords, hookers, drunkards, and no-good ruffians of every stripe. Today, the only shots being slung are at the bar - and the only meat being hustled is barbecued. That being said, the Smoke Ring is definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood - hopefully, their presence will help kick some much needed life back into this area. \\n\\nFood: Smoke Ring specializes in Georgia-style barbecue, but the menu also includes contemporary spins on traditional Southern favorites. During my two recent visits, the food has been excellent - however, for the sake of full transparency, the options were severely limited both times. On the first visit during opening week, there were only a half dozen options available. Since the only barbecue item was pulled pork, which I wasn't feeling, I opted for the ultimate grilled cheese with pimento cheese, bacon, and marmalade on sourdough - it was very nicely prepared. During my second visit, I ordered the spare ribs - however, after ordering I was advised that there was an issue in the kitchen and ribs were no longer available. They sent out complimentary pulled pork instead, which was good. However, the real showstopper was the fried green tomato appetizer with goat cheese and red pepper jam, which was among the best renditions of the dish I've had in awhile. \\n\\nService: The service was impeccable during both visits. We were promptly greeted at the door and seated, the waitstaff made a concerted effort to describe the menu items and to offer recommendations, and attentive service was provided throughout the meal. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior of Smoke Ring is probably the most contemporary that I've ever seen for a barbecue restaurant - I'd probably eat more barbecue if this was the standard. The ceilings are high and half the restaurant is comprised of large floor to ceiling windows. The seatings consists of both tables and booths, and there's also a large bar area toward the back. The vibe is very casual and the vast majority of patrons during my visits were sitting at the bar watching sporting events on the televisions. \\n\\nCost: Moderately priced. Appetizers are $3-$10, sandwiches (choice of 1 side) are $10-$15, and barbecue plates are generally $11-$15. The two meat/two side plate is  $15. Sides are $3-$5 and desserts are $5-$6. \\n\\nOther: Smoke Ring is a little tricky to find for first time visitors. The best point of reference is First Station #1, which is essentially right across the street from the restaurant at the juncture of Elliot and Nelson Streets. Nelson St. is one way, so your best bet is to find free street parking on Centennial Olympic Park and just walk over. Additionally, there is a small parking lot across from the fire house on Elliot St - the cost is only $1, but my guess is that the lot owners will wise up to the fact that they can jack up the price now that people may actually want to voluntarily park there."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"What can I say that hasn't been said?

Here's the reason for the disclaimer though: As soon as I am seated I am greeted by a fantastic waitress, Shelley, whom immediately informs me that they \\"specialize in Southern cookin'\\"\\n\\nLet me begin by informing the reader that they do in fact have their heart in the right place.  Everyone was so nice, my water glass never came close to going dry (which you all know is some serious business for me), the mimosa's were strong and delicious (not so much the pomegranate one, it's just not my deal), and the atmosphere was relaxing.\\n\\nDo they specialize in Southern food?  No.  Not at all.  They want to, very much so, but they do not specialize in Southern food.\\n\\nThe food was good but it did not even come close to the front porch of Southern food, yet alone come close to the threshold of the backdoor (the backdoor for all you non-Southern people is where we accept callers of any kind and when you are accepted at the backdoor you are family.  With a good Southern consultant (ummm, me perhaps?!), they would blow the minds of Austin.  \\n\\nThe deviled eggs were lumpy, did not contain even a hint of mayonnaise, mustard, nor pickles.  The \\"biscuits\\" were tiny little things (and they say all everything in Texas is bigger).  The accompanying gravy did not contain a hint of sausage--really, biscuits and gravy and it's not sausage gravy started with bacon grease, really?!  That's not Southern guys.  They do have an egg station, but they do not give you the opportunity to have two eggs cooked over easy--any true Southern diner would have a guy there cooking eggs for you.  The ham was in no way Southern Country Ham; Country Ham is capitalized because it is a proper noun.  It is an institution of the South and if you are going to attempt to represent yourself as a Southern diner, you must have Southern Country Ham guys, seriously, this isn't even up for discussion.  The grits.....yeah, they didn't make the cut either.\\n\\nPlease don't hate me for my honesty.  This was my very first visit to Texas; I found The Moonshine on Yelp and decided I didn't want to eat anywhere else; I want to always be welcome here and most importantly, I want for non-Southern people to have the opportunity to experience true Southern cookin'.\\n\\nWith that said, I am going to send the owners of The Moonshine a pack of Southern Country Ham as well as a roll of ground, hot sausage to put into the gravy.  These two things alone will help immensely.  The deviled eggs deal, well they are going to have to just change their recipe.\\n\\nNot all was lost though, they have an amazing foundation!  The water with cucumbers really made me feel at home.  The simple desire to take care of us from the wait staff echoed that sentiment.  The flavor of the gravy was phenomenal--it was not close to Southern, but it was delicious!  It had a great spicy flavor to it.  They also had a jalapeno sausage that I cut up into small pieces and mixed in with the gravy that really tasted great--maybe if they diced some sausage up and put it in the gravy while they were cooking it, it would come a bit closer to being Southern.  The mimosa's as I stated earlier were great; very strong but no obnoxiously so.\\n\\nAnd.  AND.  They brought me a water to go with the check as I requested, which is a big deal to me.\\n\\nThanks for having me guys and I look forward to seeing you again!  As I mentioned, if you'd like a true Southern consultant, just let me know.  I will work for bourbon drinks ;)"},{"name":"New Brothers Restaurant & Deli","address":"31 Maple St","city":"Danvers","stars":"4","text":"Not so hot for Fish and Veggies.

The menu is expansive, ranging from salads and sandwiches to buckets of homemade ravioli (there's like 10 different kinds, including asparagus, sweet potato and lobster) and other standard Italian-American entrees.  Actually. I was really curious about their  signature \\"mess,\\"  which appeared to be a hodge podge of random, whatever-we-feel-like-throwing-in-the-pan pasta + veg+ meat dish. But after much internal \\ndebate, I finally settled on the eggplant parm sandwich (only $5!) and I have no regrets. It was the perfect sized sandwich with layers of breaded eggplant and just enough oozy cheese and the most delicious, just sweet enough red sauce. The bread was soft and buttery--might even have been garlic bread, but I've yet to verify that. My mouth is watering just remembering it though...YUM. \\n\\nThe boy ordered a plate of ziti with grilled chicken, broccoli and pesto sauce. I liked that you could order the chicken breaded or grilled and with your choice of sauce (red, pesto, garlic/olive oil, or alfredo). The broccoli seemed fresh (not frozen), but the truly amazing thing was the pesto sauce. I don't generally love pesto, but I'd totally order this dish. It was really bright and flavorful. The total for the two of us came to just under $16, so I think it was a pretty good deal considering the portion size and quality. \\n\\nThe counter staff is super nice.

Twenty minutes later our water glasses were empty, we'd studied the menu to the point of memorization, and had thoroughly inspected the grill and considered what sort of amateur surgery could be conducted with such heat, and still no sign of a waiter. The poor saps next to us were still desperately trying to pay their bill, expressing frustration Portland-style (muttering and furrowed brow). My partner's previously ignorant assumption of the staff's incompetence and snobbery was escalated to flat-out fact, and we abandoned ship.

The original did something right, and they franchised across the great land of Chicago. It became popular in the suburbs of course, where there used to be very little authentic \\"chicago\\" places, save of a couple deep dish franchises too. So die-hards rally against it and its success as no longer authentic and just another ho-hum brand. But what they forget, the sandwich is still one of the best damn hot beefs, and the service is always stellar, and every location looks & feels like you walked into downtown chicago circa 1928. They did add salads to appeal to more people, but essentially you can still get a Italian Suasage wrapped in Italian Beef smothered in cheddar sauce, topped with sweet or hot peppers and served on a wet kiaser roll. [OMG my mouth is watering - sorry for the tangent].\\n\\nSo back to Rudy's. Yes its a franchise, but its an authentic Texas franchise. The meat is delicious, and having the choices of lean meats goes a long way for people who like avoid the marbled fat served at other more \\"authentic\\" bbq. The sauce is good and mildly spicy. The cream corned is by far the best I have ever tasted. The iced coolers full of bottled goodness is awesome and can find a unique selection of soda pops. \\n\\nBut all of this is really only equal to four stars. Where does the extra star come from? The ambiance and experience. Rudy's does everything right to appeal to a large audience with high degree of satisfaction to even the pickiest eaters [sans the yocal anti-franchise ppl]. Details are second to none. Where else could you find a live \\"meat camera\\" where a tv shows and overhead view of a cutting board with slabs of meat being sliced? A touchless \\"hand massage\\", not in the washroom, but right in the dining room so you can wet down before and after you dig into your meats. The paper mats on plaid covered community picnic tables. Wood burning stove on the patio. Your cashier will stack all your meats and bread slices into a soda bottling bin to carry to your awaiting table. The whole is really better than just the sum of the parts. \\n\\nAnd one gripe I had, but after many repeated visits, has been diminished: service at first seems very wasteful in the sense of all the paper, styro foam and plastic that is thrown away instead of reusable items. But there is a superb effort to cleanliness and the restaurant uses very little resources in preparation and serving. It is really up to the customers who decide how paper and plastic is used. Take home cups for fountain drinks can be reused. Its not nearly as wasteful as fast food joints or the rows of nuke & serve places the contaminate every strip mall."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"best pancakes ever! light & fluffy - just perfect pancakes.

Both the other valet and I were shocked.

However, I did like the touch of dried shrimp they added to the dish, which added a little texture and salty favor to the dish. \\nNEGATIVES\\n-The restaurant is very small, and it can be somewhat difficult to maneuver around the restaurant. Throughout dinner, we were bumped in by waiters and other customers, which was understandable and inevitable because of the small space, but it made the experience a little less comfortable. \\n-The prices are pretty steep for the small portions.

The fish wasn't that great, but it was a nice gesture.\\n\\nService was okay. We received our bread basket when we sat down. The bread was room temperature. Nothing special.

I've been there three times and all three times someone at our table never received his/her meal.  I don't care how great the food is, when a meal is ruined that way time after time it totally blows it.  The fact that the food is so good makes it worse, in that the person who doesn't get his plate knows he's REALLY missing out!  For the people who did get their food, they can't even enjoy it knowing someone else is waiting... and waiting... and WAITING.  And then for it to never come and they're starving?  That's just the suckiest thing I can think of.  The food really is excellent, but I haven't risked eating at Din Ho in about 8 months and I don't see myself going there again any time soon.  It's even more the shame that it's only a couple of miles from my house and I adore good Chinese BBQ.\\n\\nIf you want oustanding, delicious Chinese BBQ that you can actually RECEIVE WHEN YOU ORDER IT, try First Chinese BBQ in Chinatown Center at Kramar/Lamar.

It sits aside a mini golf course and has a beautiful waterfall landscape. It was a perfect place for my girlfriend and I to eat a low price dinner. When we got to the counter we ordered two buffets and large drinks and used a coupon that we had found in a coupon book that offered one buffet off with the purchase of another adult buffet and large drinks. The woman at the counter was very nice and took this off for us. Even with this free buffet I wish we would have chosen somewhere else to eat. When we advanced through the restaurant the buffet looked horrible, as it appeared that the front of the buffet did not get wiped off leaving cheese and frosting all over the place, and many of the salad items were unfilled. A worker stood behind the counterf for about thirty seconds and just watched me try to scrape what was left of the lettuce, only to go refill an already full cherry tomato bin. I was interested in the pasta but realized my mistake as there was something black floating in the water the pasta was sitting in. We grabbed what we could and took it to the cleanest booth we could find. We then went to get our drinks only to find that there was no ice in the machine and that instead it was spilling out of the runoff tray and all over the floor. Which then brings me to the issue of how dirty the restaurant was. Aside from the ice on the floor there was food and trash, everywhere on the floor. Not just under the tables but also in the middle of the walkways, leaving people to step around piles of used napkins and pizza crusts. Our booth was barely wiped and there were crumbs everywhere. There was even food on the wall. I watched a busboy wipe another table off, only to smack the food on the table onto the floors and chairs and then leave it there. I then watched a guest attempt to grab a few napkins, but was unable because the napkins were jammed in the dispenser so haphazardly, leaving him to open the top of the dispenser and grab them out that way. It was absolutely disgusting. Another thing that was brought to my attention was just how grimy the sneezeguard on the buffet was. I had to bend over to see what was on the buffet because the sneezeguard was so dirty, that you could not see through it. My girlfriend lost her appetite halfway through eating just because the place was so dirty. We left as fast as we could both because of the state of the restaurant itself and also because of the other guests who were running around in either swimsuits or without shirts on.
