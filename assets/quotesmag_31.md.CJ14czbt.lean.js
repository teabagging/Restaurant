Our waitress was careless, non-communicitative, and inattentive. To start, she did not introduce herself. Throughout our entire meal at Arepazo, she seemed to be in a terrible mood. We ordered the empanadas. They come with a delicious lime cilantro dipping sauce. The waitress brought them to our table and set them on the side of the table, hanging half on and half off. As our table was incredibly wobbly, as soon as she let go, they fell on one of my friends at the table. The waitress just looked as us with a scowl on her face. She didn't offer to bring napkins, didn't offer to bring us another order or more sauce....nothing.  We immediately switched tables due to the wobbliness of the table. She looked frustrated that we switched tables and had to clean up all the sauce that spilled everywhere. Not once did she apologize.\\n\\nAs we were ordering our main meals, I asked what type of crab was in the crab cakes. I was curious as Ohio is not near any bodies of water that have crab. I kid you not, she said \\"The crab cakes are nothing special. I've never had anyone ask me that question before.\\" Then she just proceeded to stand and look at me blankly. Perhaps she could have gone back to the chef and asked what type of crab was in the crab cakes. \\n\\nOverall, the food was decent. It was a beautiful spring day and sitting on the patio was wonderful. It is unfortunate that the waitress made our evening less enjoyable. \\n\\nTwo of us ordered the fish tacos.

They are pretty packed on weekend so it's better to come here on a weekday. They are owned by the the same owners of shoya izakaya. The place is very reminiscent of the restaurants in Japan where they have plastic displays of their food in their storefront. \\n\\nWe got seated here pretty quickly. They're menu is not as massive as the one in Shoya. I think they're more of a Ramen restaurant than a full-blown Japanese restaurant. They have a pretty big amount of space but the way they had it designed, the tables were too close to each other.\\n\\nI ordered the tonkotsu curry and my friend ordered fried chicken(can't remember exactly what it's called). The curry had really good flavor, however, I felt like the meat was not proportionate to the amount of rice they gave. Not a big enough slice of meat, in my opinion. The chicken had a gingery flavor. It was good but it seemed undercooked. \\n\\nService here was good. Nothing to complain about.

Done, we went with them- the Volcano roll (tuna, asparagus, cream cheese topped with baked scallop creamy sauce), the Godzilla roll (soft shell crab), the Kodiak roll (tuna, avocado topped with baked salmon), and Oasis roll (tuna, salmon, escolar, topped with lemon juice). All were so good, and the one that impressed was the Oasis roll. Topped with lemon juice, we never would have thought how good it could be, and it was amazing. But Alan eyed one more roll he had to have, the Lobster Bomb (panko shrimp, asparagus, avocado roll then lobster tail baked in mozzarella cheese & mayo mix). Another delicious sushi roll.

The giant shrimp & crab cake needs to be less giant and more shrimp & crab flavour.  \\n\\nMost recently, I was at Street Food City II where I had their crab & shrimp cake sandwich and their prawn & proscuitto tacos. Sounds awesome, right?  Sadly, both items lacked seasoning. I was disappointed in the sandwich most, because had I been blindfolded, I wouldn't have known that there was crab in this.  I was hoping for an improvement on their previous crab & shrimp cake, but I was left hanging. All I could taste was potato with black pepper.  Also, the texture was very mushy so after a couple of bites, the whole thing fell apart.  Good thing I had a fork and lots of napkins. The tacos were better, but they were still screaming out for some salt. \\n\\nI'm hoping that this recent experience was an off-day for them and is not an indication of a slip in quality control.

It was packed and we did have to wait a minute for a table, but everyone here was so friendly and gracious. We noticed two gentlemen having a lean on a table and asked if we could snag it from them, to which they agreed without a second thought. Later we found a larger table and so we handed the tall table to the next people waiting. \\n\\nI love this concept. It's outside, open, and totally chill. The food is affordable, filling, and good value while still being pretty basic. The beer is great, too. I love the toy room and the fact that kids just wander around and no one is concerned. It feels like a neighborhood block party.\\n\\nSo I was sad to learn they are closing down this location and opening up a brick-and-mortar elsewhere with a totally different concept. My cousin's 4-year-old was devastated as this is one of his favorite places to go. Hopefully they will have enough feedback from current visitors to realize they need to incorporate as much of their current feel into the new place as possible."},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"A solid showing and finally a tapas place up to par in Austin.  Definitely makes the list of spots to frequent (3 times in 2 months for me).  Four stars in my book - above average to great.\\n\\nI really like the tapas style of food and I mean Spanish tapas not putting whatever on a small plate, knocking the entree price down by a third and calling it tapas.  This place had a cool vibe, bright space and open kitchen.  It was noisy and even the non-communal seats are close together but that's how they do it in Madrid and Barcelona so maybe I spin that and call it authentic.  Pull up a chair and say hi to your neighbors.\\n\\nWhatever, didn't matter because the food was great and what this place is about.  Meaning they had the staples required like patatas bravas, seasoned olives and macadamia nuts, mushrooms, paella, and a meat and cheese plate.  And the rest of the menu has good range, some uniqueness and great flavor throughout.\\n\\nThe hidden gem on the menu is mushrooms/pine nuts/currants from the starters - pretty hard to believe mushrooms in a sardine can could be that good."},{"name":"Boston Kitchen Pizza","address":"1 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Was visiting Tufts and decided to grab a quick bite to eat.

Gilbert's Wood Fired Steaks & Seafood Columbus","address":"1 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Something is amiss at our favorite restaurant.  They are little things but it's indicative of a possible shift that we're not fans of.  We've been going here for many years and when we came in, there was no one at the front desk.  That has never happened, there have always been two people, one to potentially seat while the other attends to people coming in.  We thought it was odd but didn't think much of it.  Four servers passed us by not even looking our way.  After almost 5 minutes, which doesn't seem long but it is when you're standing there being ignored, more people began to come in behind us and get impatient.  Finally a man asked if we'd been helped and we said no and he said he'd go check to see if there were any tables available since we didn't have a reservation.  We never saw him again. (This was late on a Sunday evening and I checked their website before we left and saw every time slot was available so I didn't think it was necessary)   \\n\\nWhen the hostess did make her way to the stand, she was more concerned with getting her beverage from her friend at the bar and that it had all of the right ingredients in it.  The people behind us yelled over us and said \\"look, we just want to sit down, can we just go into the bar?\\" when she said she'd have to seat them, they walked in there anyway.  So said she'd go check for a table...okay, I can literally see 6 open tables from where I stood and I don't think they're getting a rush after 8pm.  When we were seated, the table was horrible.  The seat had springs popping up and making loud noises and the table rocked back and forth and it was attached to the wall.  (It's one of those little two seat booths)  We ignored it as best we could even though each movement was met with \\"squeak, squeak, squeak\\" all through dinner.  I didn't move in my seat because I was afraid of the ejector seat rocketing me to the ceiling.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons we love it there is their amazing steak sauce.  It's this homemade mesquite deliciousness and we've taken people there just to try this stuff.  So when our steaks arrived and they asked if we needed anything else, we said the steak sauce.  When they brought it out, it was this glaze looking stuff.  We thought the guy made a mistake because he mentioned he was new.  We tried twice to flag down our server (whole other irritating story) and when she came over we said we think he brought us the wrong thing and we needed the steak sauce.  She said that was the steak sauce.  We looked at each other and she said \\"oh, they changed the recipe.\\"  \\n\\n ~*~ record scratch~*~\\n\\nIn that moment, I wanted to curl up in a ball and cry after we both looked at each other in horror.  Yes...it was that good.  We gave the new stuff a try and it's nothing like the old stuff or even like a real steak sauce.  It's like a teriyaki bourbon (?) something or other which is fine if that's what you're in the mood for but it was overpowering and the hubby definitely didn't like it at all.  At least offer the other as an option or start stocking A1 as an alternate for people who want a little something on it but not wanting something so overwhelming.\\n\\nOh yeah and where the heck did the massive bowl of mints go??  Our dinner was never complete without grabbing a few of those teeny mints on the way out as we were bid a cheery adieu by the hostess.  Now no mints, no steak sauce and no goodbye.  Again these all may seem minor but when your formerly favorite restaurant starts letting things slip, you start to wonder if you need to start finding a new favorite restaurant for celebrations."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I went there long time ago but I still remember how delicious the dessert was and I totally recommend it to food lovers like me. :)"},{"name":"Lucky Plus Restaurant","address":"3823 Rupert Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Went there for dim sum on a Monday, assuming the busy weekend would clear out the stale food (classic Asian). \\n\\nShould've turned around as soon as I set afoot...restaurant smelled oddly musty and damp. \\n\\nService was slow, and everything we ordered ranged from mediocre to spoiled.

Please take this all because I want you to make it, so ahead is very blunt review of your menu. Where is your head chef!!?? This menu can not be his or her idea. \\nFor a more upscale looking restaurant, you'd want something special. Add a cheese board or more trendy apps. Devils on Horseback, Charcuterie, something wrapped in bacon. All of your apps could be found at any local chain like 99. Don't be a 99, be an 02155 Carroll's! \\nSalads are B O R I N G. Get crazy and put one with fruit on the menu and perhaps non iceberg lettuce. The mac and cheese was meh. If it's homemade have it be way more flavorful, on the menu describe what kind of mac and cheese it is. \\nKeep ya burgah's as they ah... but add a couple interesting combos on there.. blue cheese stuffed or something for the people who like different. \\nEntrees, if you want to keep the white tables, do this entirely over.

What is a bit odd is the sports bar/book pub dichotomy. On one wall you have nice dark wood surrounding a few shelves of a take one-leave one library filled with paperbacks. Next to it is a row of small one or two person tables -- the perfect set up to curl up with your book and a pint of Smithwicks (on tap with Guinness and Hoegaarden, notably). Yet, on the other side of the narrow room are two HDTVs, one showing a game, the other blasting after-work ESPN sports talk-show jibber-jabber (and their website boasts the cable sporting packages they have on hand). I'm not saying sports and books are mutually exclusive, it's just an odd combo -- usually a place will settle on one or the other. I don't know if Boston or Union Sq needs another bar where I can watch ESPN or a football game, but I would say there is a lack of places where you could sit at a table with a beer and book and maybe play a song on a jukebox without interrupting Pardon My Interruption. \\n\\nMcCabe's is of course in a tough position of being compared to Tir Na Nog, the best bar that Union Sq had going for it. Nothing much has changed from how the Nog was set up, except for perhaps one of the best parts of the Nog -- the kitchen. You won't find a good burger and a fried Milky Way at McCabe's. But you will find some decent live music -- the one thing that has carried over. Oh, and when there isn't a band paying there is a dart board available.\\n\\nThere's some potential here to be more like Atwood's or Shay's -- a comfortable woody place to hang out, rather than a standard issue Boston-Irish bar.  Right now, the library of paperbacks and the smell of new paint is the only thing setting McCabe's apart from the dozens of other Irish bars within walking distance.

I was super excited to try this place out. \\n\\nI made reservations via their online system a few days in advance. 8 people, 8pm, Friday night. \\n\\nI arrived at 8pm and informed the waitress that I had a reservation. Upon looking around I saw all the simulators were full so I was hoping there wasn't a mix up in my reservation! The waitress checked and let us know we booked simulator one however the people were finishing off their round so it'll be a few minutes. Sure- that happens. People run behind. \\n\\nAbout 10 to 15 minutes later, we finally get to go to our simulator to start playing. This is where the issues began. If you have been to One Under, you'll know there is a small table top near the simulators by the computer (with about 3 seats) and behind the simulators there are bigger tables. Well, as luck would have it, the group of guys who were running behind on our booked simulator also decided to stay and take their time hanging out at the table right behind our simulator. So myself and 7 friend just hung around the simulator and small table top wondering when we were going to be able to sit down. We came at 8pm so we also planned on ordering food. \\n\\nAs my friends tried to get the game going, I asked the waitress about the table and if it was included in our booking. She said no it's usually not and has to be reserved separately. That was annoying because nowhere on the online reservation did it indicate this and now I was left thinking my friends would have nowhere to sit. The waitress suggested bringing 5 chairs around our small table top or having my friends at a different table which was about 15 steps away. I said that wasn't ideal because then we'd have to keep walking back and forth and you couldn't even see our simulator from that table. I blatantly asked her if we were going to get the table behind us because if not then we won't be ordering pizza because there's no room to eat it. She said she will see what she can do. All along while my friends are super confused and wondering if they should be ordering pizza (and where we will be eating it) or not. We are 45 minutes into our time and so I just ask the waitress if she can ask the group of guys to move to the empty table (The same one she suggested we go to). She says she'll see what she can do. She comes back and says they're just finishing up their round and then leaving. So I tell my friends we should order. My friends order and the pizzas arrive and there's literally nowhere to put them. I'm super frustrated- the group of guys are still at the table, pizzas are coming with nowhere to put them, and my friends are all just standing around the simulator wondering what's going on. It wasn't a good time. \\n\\nI finally ask to speak to a manager and we come up with the solution to move us to the simulator that is in front of the empty table. Thank you manager (I forgot her name). My group moves over to the new simulator and starts a new game. About 5 minutes in... the machine starts to reset and all our scores are gone. I let the waitress know (Same waitress) and we just continue to play because we were only 1 round in. 15 minutes later, after 6 rounds, the machine decides to reset again and all our scores are gone again. Talk about frustrating. \\n\\nAt that point, I was over it. No one was having fun and it just seemed like problem after problem. I didn't want to play anymore so we decided to just leave. Side note, one of the pizzas we ordered took forever to come out and didn't come out until we decided to pay our bill, basically after everyone else ate. We left the restaurant at 9:30 pm.\\n\\nThe manager was so kind and I know the waitress did her best. Because of them, I give this place 2 stars instead of 1.

I've been ordering this item since they opened and it's still perfection. The succulent pieces of sweet Lobster are tempura fried, lightly dressed and piled in the soft corn tortilla shell over cabbage. Pickled jalapenos can be in the taco or on the side, they have the right amount of heat and tang- they add a great layer of flavor to this dish. The tacos are topped with an avocado creme, a trio of tacos make up the order. \\n\\nI enjoyed an iced tea, watched TV and caught up on emails on my phone. Tacos were out quickly and the bartender made sure my tea was always full while attending to bar orders and other lunch diners around the bar. Great option for a quick bite when your time is short. \\n\\nLunch in the restaurant: Enjoyed a Saturday lunch with friends, no rush. Made reservations through Opentable.com.

To my surprise, the dish came out with a fried fish the length of the plate, much bigger than other restaurants I have been to. The fish was fried nicely and not very greasy. The fries were well cooked but could have used a little more seasoning. Having said that, I was happier seasoning them myself than having someone over season them. The other surprise from the plate were the hush puppies! The plate comes with some hush puppies included, which won me over. I love hush puppies.

Maybe it's a good thing.  \\n\\nHave you ever been to a place that's trying to be way too many things for way too many people?  That's Random Order... but unlike most multi-taskers, Random Order gets it right.  \\n\\nOpen from 6:30am-Midnight most days of the week, it's truly an over-achiever.  That means you can potentially spend the whole day/night there!  I haven't done this yet, but who knows... one of these days I might just get wild and crazy enough to try it!  \\n\\nRandom Order offers breakfast sandwiches (I haven't had them but my friends are big fans).  Really delicious lunch options - order the Rosemary's Baby with Ciabatta (they recently changed the menu and the bread but they'll still make it the way I LOVE it).  Dinner is less specific... it's as if the dinner hours become dessert and cocktail hours.  \\n\\nOne thing I've learned from hanging out at Random Order is that people eat pie for all meals!  Who knew?!  I've watched families, couples, singles, people of all persuasions come in for pie at all times of the day.  This is highly respectable. There are also many non-dairy options if you can't stomach milk or factory-farming.  \\n\\nIn the evening hours, you can expect the atmosphere to get a bit more lively. There's always fun music playing throughout the day, but the music gets even more spirited at night.  It's a fun place to stop for cocktails (or pie), but I might not be the best reviewer for that since I order a drink about as often as I change the oil in my car.  \\n\\nThere are so many nice people that work at Random Order.  The service is always friendly and many of the employees have been around for all the years I've been a customer.  The location rocks -it's within walking distance of everything fun and interesting on Alberta Street.  \\n\\nI would be truly remiss to go without mentioning my favorite detail at Random Order (second only to Rosemary's Baby on Ciabatta!).  There is a wooden library-style magazine rack featuring all the sophisticated magazines I would subscribe to if I made time to read them.  I love this feature and feel especially self-indulgent selecting a magazine and sitting back to enjoy.  \\n\\nIn case you can't tell, I love this place.

I stayed over the Mega-Con weekend last March and couldn't have been happier with my overall experience. \\n\\nMy best friend and I got a room so that we would not have to commute to the convention center nor have to deal with the outrageous convention center parking. Our experience from last year told us that during the weekend the closest parking areas fill up almost immediately and we did not want to have to walk in the heat from one concourse to another! So we got a room at the Peabody and were thrilled to be staying across the street from the Hall in which our Convention was held. We could even see the banner from the 8th floor room that we were on.\\n\\nThe room itself was decadent. We were very impressed. There was a TV in the bathroom mirror and a gorgeous king bed. The bed was like sleeping in a cloud and when you add up an entire day of being on your feet in a crowded convention plus a hot shower in their amazing bathrooms plus a bed that feels like heaven - lets just say I passed out almost instantly. We were even late for the next day's festivities because we did not want to get out of bed!!\\n\\nIt was a great experience because whenever we got bored or restless with the convention, we could just hop back across the street and either take a nap, explore the hotel, get a snack in any of the restaurants or even just hang out by the pool. \\n\\nThe hotel staff were very courteous to ourselves and, we were surprised to see, even some of the other guests who were dressed in costume! Instead of being ostracized, many were stopped and complimented by the staff. I can't say as much as for the other guests of the hotel but, considering what everyone was paying for their rooms and suites, it's nice to know that discrimination wasn't part of their repertoire.\\n\\nWe didn't order room-service because, frankly, nothing on the menu struck a chord with me. Nothing seemed too extraordinary and I do remember being remarkably surprised at the lack of desserts on the menu. I always just assumed that room-service meant ridiculous amounts of chocolate and sweets delivered to your door late at night. \\n\\nAll in all, it was a wonderful experience and something that I plan on repeating each and every year that I attend Mega-Con.

The one thing I like is that there are TVs everywhere! Both outside and inside, which makes Sunday football watching that much easier. The only reason I give this place four stars is because I've only eaten off their breakfast menu (which I would give 5 stars on its own).

Samuel Adams & Harpoon on draft...both good breweries and my beers tasted good, but you can find those everywhere in Boston.

I explained to her that I got the text code from their website and didn't think it was specific to any one location. She reluctantly agreed to honor the deal and proceeded to berate me and complain about the company in front of a line of customers. I was completely dumbfounded and could not believe how rude and unprofessional this woman was! I was tempted to just tell her to forget it and walk out with nothing. I'm assuming this is a franchise business and this woman is the owner or manager? The sandwich alone was $4.15, which was a mini (5\\") Avocado Delight. Comparatively, you can go to Subway or Quiznos and get a sandwich with chips and a drink for about $5.

Oh Tofu. For many Americans it represents healthy living and bad tasting substitutes for meat. In America, they're generally right. At 88 Tofu House, tofu is like having rice. It's great when you throw it in with a whole mess of everything else. Don't be scared off by the name ('cause you know tofu is sooo scary for many Americans.)\\n\\nMmmm. Korean soupy goodness. Sure this place is 'round the clock, and so with any 24 hour food spot, you end up getting lots of reviews saying things like, \\"It's 2am, want some good food? want something to fulfill that after bar, after club food craving?\\" However, much like people in China don't call chinese food, chinese food, you can eat Korean food for breakfast. Yes, as difficult as it may be for Atlantans to not eat grits, biscuits, gravy or all of the other southern comfort foods, you can in fact eat Korean food for breakfast. (I think most of Korea does this.)\\n\\nOrder the soup. Any of them. It'll come out literally bubbling and boiling in it's own super heated bowl. Along with your soup you'll receive a number of small pre-dishes, such as inch long salted fish, flavored strips of squid, sweet cucumber slices, kimchee, and other stuffs.\\n\\nI ordered the shrimp tofu soup with rice hash. The rice hash is basically a number of vegetables and meat thrown over a bowl of rice, a very hot bowl. Oh. It was a nice surprise to also have two fried fish brought out which I expertly deboned and threw into my rice hash. These are salted sea water fish that you can't find at most seafood restaurants. Not the actual type of fish, just the preparation. More like the ones you find dried and bagged at your asian farmer's market, and not the fresh fish section. As muddled as that description is, it taste just like the fish my mom would prepare when we moved to the U.S. after leaving the Phillipines. Things I miss from home.\\n\\nFresh Tofu, packaged tofu, fermented tofu. Maybe the differences and true nuances are lost on me. Maybe, maybe not. I enjoy eating tofu right out of the package, in cold slices as I prepare to fry them. I enjoy fried and pressed tofu. 88 Tofu house serves decently good tofu. Sure it's not going to be as fresh as the stuff they make onsite just down the street, but it's going to be good. Just eat your soup with the tofu bits and let the warmth sink in.\\n\\nOh yes, I ordered the shrimp tofu soup and this was definitely not your average shrimp plate. These were large pieces, complete with shell, legs, and head intact. A real treat. So suck the juices out of the shrimp head before you bite the sucker clean off.\\n\\nThis being a tofu house, there are of course vegetarian options, which unfortunately tend to be closer to the bland side. Seafood flavors abound and are the strength here. Bring your friends that like to eat the ocean. While this isn't the best Korean food around, I'd bet that it's up there as the most comfortable, comforting, and easy going. The space is clean and the service generally attentive. Many Koreans eat here and that's who else was eating there during our breakfast visit.\\n\\nThis isn't some fake Korean/Chinese restaurant that caters to Americanized palates. 88 Tofu is good and warms me from the inside. If you want to show visitors how truly diverse and great Atlanta can be, after you take them to the usual places, surprise them and eat at 88 Tofu."},{"name":"Millenia106","address":"4104 Millenia Blvd, Ste 106","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Outstanding food!

A few other things you should know: it's dog friendly, you can pour your own drip coffee, they have alcohol all the time and make their own bitters and infused liquors."},{"name":"Corner Bakery Cafe","address":"19325 NW Emma Way","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3.5","text":"Had a coupon for a free soup so I decided to give this place a try.

The soup has a lot of sodium and then I had the ham and swiss on pretzel bread (again more salt).  All in all, it was pretty tasty.  I didn't get to ask, but if I go again, I'd ask if I can swap breads from the one listed on the menu.  \\nI'd put this establishment in the same realm as Panera."},{"name":"Downtown CREDO","address":"550 E Rollins St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Super friendly barista.

I always recommend this place to those who are new in town or looking for a new joint. Tin shed absolutely makes sure experience is a good one. \\n\\nHeres a great example. I ordered a breakfast dish that unfortunately had a long brown hair in it. I was surprised and told my server.

Yes, the fried chicken is the best in the city. Yes, civil rights activist ate here. Yes, you should leave room for dessert. Yes, this is where Jovita Moore interviewed Jay -Z. Good for all occasions. Including catering. And if Mike's in the kitchen, you will get your take out order in record breaking time. If you decided to eat in, the space is quaint. Bring your manners, tip your server and take some time to notice all the history on the walls while you wait. Paying with plastic? You need your ID. You cannot swipe and go here. And guess what?

If your looking for Bud Light, this is not your place. In fact if macro-breweries are your thing than you, nothing on this menu will look familiar too you. The Pig only has complex, delicious micro-brews. My favorite was the white-ale which was flavored with citrus and coriander. Amazing! \\n\\nI began my meal with the Gruyere biscuits and the Shrimp and Grits. The biscuits themselves are little creatures of wonder. They are so cheesy and you can literally peel them apart by layer. The shrimp and grits dish, one of their signatures, is drizzled with chorizo oil. The grits have an nice smokey corn flavor that pairs really well with the chorizo oil. \\n\\nFor my main course I had the house-made tagliatelle with New Smyrna Beach little neck clams and house-made sausage in a white-wine lemon garlic sauce. The pasta was great, really reminds you how much different homemade can taste. Same thing goes for the sausage. Just really well made and seasoned (fennel).   \\n\\nSo looking forward to my next visit to the Pig!

A lot of people complain about tea being expensive, but what do they think they are going to pay at a tea house. The owners have rent, taxes, salaries, insurance and other overhead.

The owner/server, Eel Een is absolutely the best, and is a big reason I keep returning.  She knows who I am as soon as I call in an order, and always greets me when I walk in with a friendly smile (and she is ALWAYS there).

It was a Sunday at noon on a game day, so we thought it was going to be packed, but apparently noon was just the perfect time to get in. The crowds started coming in around 12:30pm. \\n\\nWINGS\\nTheir fried buffalo wings (medium) with ranch are in my opinion, perfect. They have a bit of kick, are crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. I usually order ten wings because 6 isn't enough, and ten keeps me full. Their baked wings on the other hand, are not as good. They are not tender, and don't really taste like buffalo wings. \\n\\nSIDES\\nWhen I'm not dieting and want to splurge, I love eating their fries. They're not really anything special, but for some reason they're addicting. When I want to be healthy, I'll get the celery or broccoli. The broccoli is actually delicious. Must be the butter :)\\n\\nATMOSPHERE\\nThis location has plenty of seating and tons of screens with various games playing at the same time. It is actually one of my favorite layouts for a Taco Mac. It is a huge venue and feels more open than some of the configurations of the other locations. \\n\\nSERVICE\\nThis is really where the missed stars are. I had indecisively ordered the blue cheese sauce, but changed my mind at the last minute to ranch and she had noted the change. But later she brought out the blue cheese instead, so I asked if I could have ranch. Since my friend didn't ask for any sauce with his wings, she said, \\"You can have his ranch.\\" Granted I did make it confusing with changing my sauce order last minute, but she shouldn't count that against me. If my friend had gotten sauce, she would've likely charged me for the \\"extra\\" sauce. Also, they don't serve alcohol until 12:30 on Sundays because of a Georgia rule. So my friend had ordered a beer earlier and she said she'd bring it over at 12:30. We had to request her to bring over the beer at 12:45.

So when I moved to Boston, away from my parents, I never thought I would find a place that would have it on their menu. Until I found Oppa sushi . This place is more of a Korean-sushi restaurant, rather than a Japanese sushi restaurant. I was not disappointment in my meal. The chef hooked it up; the portion of my entree was pretty big and had many pieces of sashimi for the price of the dish. \\n\\nThe tteokpoki was average. Nothing to die for. Comes with two fried dumplings on top of the sauce. \\n\\nThe Sushi Regular is a typical dish of variety kinds of fish (nothing too special). The chef puts a little bit of wasabi in between the fish and the rice which my boyfriend enjoyed. \\n\\nThis place is a hole in the wall, small, local family run business.

I had one girl who was very sweet and another who was okay. Not bad, by any means. Also, I know this isn't an upscale joint by any means, but they may want to have a dress code that says no dirty ripped jean shorts and inside out black shirts. I saw a lot of that, and to me it looks like people don't give a crap about what kind of image they project, which then reflects on the place.\\n\\nAs for the food, I had a really amazing apple cider muffin - not at all dry, very simple and very tasty! I picked up a gluten free cupcake for a friend, which I didn't try but just looked great. One day I had iced coffee, the other I had an iced white mocha... and I don't know, maybe my taste buds are different than other people's but I just don't get the appeal. I preferred the latte to the iced coffee, so I'll assume the quality of the espresso-based beverages is better than the brewed iced - but still nothing to write home about. \\n\\nOnce again, I want this place to be awesome, and I want it to be there every time I go back, just a little bit better.

Prosciutto is nice and sweet, not too salty. Burrata is nice and creamy. Crostinis are nicely toasted and brushed with olive oil. Yum.\\n\\n-- Anchovy, olives, chiles pizza (3*)\\nDisappointing. But you know what they say about pizza... The pizza was way too salty overall, the anchovies were unrecognizable on the pie, and the olives were unnecessary. I was expecting nicer fillets of anchovies, perhaps house-cured, but was disappointed by the mushy overcooked bits of fish. The crust was thin and crispy, but lacked body and chewiness.\\n\\n-- Italian sausage, onions, sweet pepper pizza (4*)\\nMuch better than the anchovy one. Onions were sweet, peppers were sweet, sausage was spicy but sadly just a bit overcooked. The crust was better this time. Still thin and crisp, but had a bit more chewiness to it. I should add that we ordered the anchovy pizza on our first visit, and the sausage one on our second visit. Maybe they had an off day on our first visit, or perhaps they are inconsistent making their dough.\\n\\n-- Rigatoni boscaiola (4*)\\nPasta was nicely cooked. Mushrooms good. The sauce was nice, not too rich or heavy. Not very exciting, but quite comforting.\\n\\n-- Chocolate budino (3*)\\nThere's a layer of salted caramel on top of the pudding that's a bit excessive. Half the amount of caramel would have pushed it up to 4 stars. The crunchy salt was just the right amount.\\n\\n-- Tiramisu (4*)\\nA very straightforward tiramisu, which just the right amount of sweetness.\\n\\nOverall, nothing spectacular, but definitely worth returning to."},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Hidden gem!

No, he's not an elder Cuban exile. He is a fan of dark, smokey, slightly mysterious bars. He likes the occasional high quality cigar, and he enjoys a tasty beverage with said smoke. I do not begrudge him any of this. I actually enjoy coming along on his Sunday afternoon swings by Greater Trumps, as long as I get to have a delicious Sidecar!\\n\\nHe always brings the Sunday New York Times, despite the fact that it is too dark to read a darn thing, as far as I can tell. We sit in a booth, in the back, in a corner, in the dark (are any Yelpers even old enough to remember that song lyric?!), He orders some sort of frosty McMennamins' beer or ale, I have my Sidecar made with fresh juice, and then he purchases the cigar...it's a ritual. I fear this will soon go by the wayside due to the new smoking laws soon to be enacted in Oregon. I don't mind a cigar, and I actually relish the scent of good pipe tobacco. It's the cancer sticks I cannot abide, and for this egregious habit, I am thankful for the new law. This will, however, put a damper of our late Sunday afternoon ritual, so adaptation will be in order. I hope Greater Trumps can figure this out, tho' I am sure they will come up with some inventive plan.\\n\\nFor those who do not enjoy a cigar, food is available from The Baghdad Theater. It's only fair-to-middlin', as most food offerings from McMennamins' seem to be.

Overall it was good, but there was some quirks.\\n\\nFirst issue: They only took cash. There was an ATM at the Plaid Pantry next door, but it's still sort of a pain. Second issue: The seating was sort of difficult. The tables mostly seemed to be designated for groups of two or like maybe three, but we had uh. More than that. A few people with our group just left because they didn't like how loud it was (there was some live music of some kind), so we ended up finding a table to seat five of us.\\n\\nThird issue: It may just be me, but reading the rules presented on the menu and trying to figure out how to proceed sort of worked out like a logic puzzle. Like, every person must spend at minimum $4, however most drinks were around $2.75 and the desserts were around $5. We had five people, two of whom couldn't pay for themselves, so we had to like work out what combination of things to get for who such that we weren't in violation of their per-person dining cost.\\n\\nAlso in addition to that, it seems like they run out of their menu items pretty regularly. I tried ordering the lemon mousse cake, but they were out (leaving everything else on their main dessert menu as a chocolate option, unfortunately).\\n\\nOur table ended up getting a few various mochas, the super cider, the jasmine tea, and a couple of dessert items (pot du creme and the chocolate mocha cake). All of the drinks were good, though it seemed like the most well liked was the cider (someone commented that it tasted exactly like liquid apple pie). The desserts were super rich, and the mocha cake almost seemed more like fudge than a cake.\\n\\nOverall though, despite the problems I mentioned, everyone I went with (and stayed to get food) really enjoyed the experience! The bathroom was really cool, and the waiter was nice (though it did take a pretty long time for the waiter to show up in general).

I have enjoyed the food every time and ordered a variety of things from their menu.  They recently underwent renovations and gave the place a very nice face-lift, and also changed the menu a bit.  Here are some highlights of what I enjoy from Golden Light:\\n\\nCrab Rangoon: They are awesomely addictive here, by far the best around!  They are triangle-folded, and heavily stuffed with a cream cheese, crab meat, onion and seasoning.  Everyone I have introduced these to is hooked on them.  Soooooooo good, a must order!\\n\\nEgg Rolls:  I really like these egg rolls, they are stuffed with a mix of the cabbage/pork and seasonings but theirs have a dark green leafy type of cabbage.  It really adds a lot of flavor, they taste great and I think are better than the standard egg rolls you get at most places.\\n\\nSalt and Pepper Shrimp:  Their version is cleaned, de-shelled, butterflied and battered.  You get a large portion of the shrimp which are pan fried and sauteed with a little pepper and onion for flavor, the salt and pepper spice (so good!) and served on a bed of sprouts.  I prefer these to the traditional head-on style.\\n\\nHouse Special Fried Rive:  I like this white-fried-rice version and they pack it with just about everything, chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, peppers, onions, peas and I like to order this extra spicy so they add a good amount of chilli peppers and kick up the heat. \\n\\nBeef and Broccoli:  This is delicious here, the sauce is very good and there is a ton of broccoli which is always cooked just right, bright green, slightly al-dente and not overdone.  The beef is very tender and delicious, much higher quality than a lot of other places use.\\n\\nGive them a try and order some of my suggestions, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. :)"},{"name":"Antica Pizzeria & mozzarella Bar","address":"249 W State Hwy 436, Ste 1105","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"If you ever imagine how pizza from Italy taste like then this is the place for you.

Here's how it all went down...\\n\\nIt was a Friday night, and the current \\"guy I like\\" decided to pop up before heading out with friends. So I pressured him into a walk around the neighborhood because it was a beautiful night to enjoy under the stars--and because my apartment was a mess and I didn't want him to see sh*t everywhere!\\n\\nWe walked through Inman Park into the Virginia-Highlands and back again around Inman Park--seriously, my apartment was THAT bad! So after I was damn near famished/fatigued we decided to give in to the amazing aroma coming from Jack's. \\n\\nUpon entry, we were very clear that we weren't going to be able to get a seat inside. Not only because it was a poppin' Friday night--which appears to also be Bingo night--but the $1 40-oz. of malt liquor (think Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\") seemed to be a blaring hit.\\n\\nMy Mouth: \\"One slice of cheese please.\\" \\nDude-Behind-the-Bar (yea BAR!): \\"It's going to be about an hour.\\" \\nMy Mouth: Really dude??! ARGGGHH! Fine.\\nMy Brain: \\"THANK GOD! He must know how bad my apartment looks too... more time to kill!\\" *happy dance*\\n\\nThe Dude-Behind-the-Bar (DBB) asks if we want two complimentary \\"forties\\". We politely declined and here's why... I'm African-American. So is the \\"guy I like\\". And he's big--6'6\\" big! As two very educated professionals, who were raised with both parents we are FULLY aware that it Is NEVER okay for \\"us\\" to drink forties in public (with or without the customary brown paper bag!) Unless Snoop Dogg hands it to you himself, it's a big NO-NO!\\n\\nBack to the story... so we took two Blue Moon's instead and headed outside to grab a seat on one of the nearby benches. One hour goes by... I go back in to check on my ONE slice of cheese (nothing fancy!) DBB let's me know, it's not ready but offers up another round of beers. I'm not sure if getting us drunk is a common Jack's tactic but but my guy was happy and that's all that mattered in the world (don't forget the trashed a$$ apartment I was hiding.) \\n\\n:30 mins go by and we're accosted by a homeless man who plays the harmonica and comes up with inappropriate lyrics on the spot. My guy starts to get annoyed, I head back in to check on the slice. Not ready! By the time I head back out to the bench, harmonica-dude and my guy seem to have bonded and are looking up YouTube videos on his iPhone. I KID YOU NOT! \\n\\nANOTHER :20 mins go by and we both head inside--it's only Spring, it's starting to get cold--and my slice is done! There's still is no seating, so I just decide to stand over the bar and devour my food... AND IT WAS GOOD AS HELL! \\n\\nNot a little bit good but \\"I might wait for another slice\\" good! I don't know what I was expecting but the homemade sauce, perfect light and crispy crust along with the humongous size was GREAT! And although the amount of time we waited was unimaginable I have to say, DBB made it all very tolerable. Aside from being severely cute, he was attentive, courteous and did every thing one person could do to keep everyone smiling. Even my guy had no complaints on the experience of it all.\\n\\nWe will definitely be making our way back soon. If not only for the amazing pizza, drink specials and late hours but I wouldn't mind seeing the cute DBB again *wink*\\n\\nUPDATE: I hear they offer delivery now so I've kept my apartment consistently spotless from that point forward."},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Last night, we went to celebrate my son's birthday.

For my appetizer I had the local greens with Briar Rose ch√®vre, chimichurri, & radish, a really elevated version of a mixed greens salad.  Choosing an entree was difficult, but I went with the local foraged mushroom stroganoff with fresh pappardelle, hen of the woods, cr√®me fra√Æche, and it was outstanding!

First off, they moved Ravenous Pig to the C&L location and kept a few key items from the C&L menu. I'm sure they had their reasons for doing this, but it was a let down for me because I loved Cask. \\nBut back to Ravenous Pig. In years past, I felt I could order anything on the menu and trust it would be amazing. However, after 3-4 subpar experiences, I felt dubious about returning there for brunch yesterday. \\nWe started with the biscuits and gravy, which was great (those gruyere biscuits are amazing). My husband got their famous pub burger and truffle fries while I opted for the chicken and waffles. The burger was good (it always is) and the fries had great flavor, but they were undercooked. \\nAs for the chicken and waffles... It just didn't work. The chicken, the waffles, the relish....it didn't taste good together and none of the elements worked on their own either. Maybe I missed something, but the flavors just did not blend well. It flat out didn't taste good, which is so disappointing for a restaurant that focuses on American classics such as chicken and waffles. \\nService was good and the atmosphere in the bar is one of the best around.

In contrast, the honey bbq wings were full of zing and tang and not too sweet, which is my usual gripe. My medium border burger was well made and delicious though I was sad to see only a few sprinkles of cheese. When I order a burger with cheese, it would be nice to taste it.

I was warned earlier that day by two people that it might be very difficult to get a table without a reservation.. it was too late - we decided to risk it. We arrived at the establishment, after circling the lot for a few minutes to find a spot, we finally snagged one. Parking is extremely limited here - probably because half of it is roped off for valet. We walked in and checked in with the hostess. She immediately sat us down at a nice secluded table in the back. Perfect! No wait - we were very happy about that. \\n\\nAfter perusing the menu for quite some time, unsure on what to order - we decided to go with the BITE30 menu because of the value & courses. (BITE30: Three courses for $30) We ordered the Steak Tartare & Shrimp and Grits for the appetizer course. Honestly not sure what the brown smear on the plate of the tartare was - a bit unappealing. Although, flavor for both dishes were great! Shrimp and grits were creamy and delicious. We got the Chicken Breast & Basil Tagliatelle for the main course. I enjoyed the salty skin on the chicken breast and the flavor of the beer-naise. The dish was very salty over all. Onion-bacon jam seemed to have truffles mixed into it. The mushroom polenta came in the form of a small square under the chicken breast. The chicken was very moist. As for the Basil Tagliatelle - I am not sure what happened here. The noodles were not impressive at all. Seemed as though they had been sitting and gotten soggy. Very very strange. I've seen other pictures of the dish here on Yelp and it looked a lot more impressive. Next onto the dessert course: Chocolate Tres Leches & Pig Tails. The 'coconut macaroon' on the Tres Leches was simply just a chocolate coconut cake object? Tasty none the less. Flavor of the overall dish was mostly cherry. Was not too impressed - dish looked a bit sad. As for  the Pig Tails - you can't really go wrong with fried dough & sugar. Tasty but not impressed. \\n\\nService was average. Our waiter was patient and friendly. Our water glasses were never empty. I appreciated that.

The bacon in the Caesar felt a bit soggy and the green bean looking thing tasted fishy. At that point, I was already eyeballing Blue Label, just sitting there staring back at me. $36 for a neat, that's actually not bad for the price of booze in this town. So after eating some Buffalo Sriracha Wings and finishing my Blue Label, I was in a good spot.

In addition to that, they also brought out chicken lemon soup (out of this world amazing), hummus (and I'll just state here, it was perhaps, the best hummus I've had at a restaurant in Austin), and cream puff desserts.

It also doesn't come with cheese or chicken or anything fun like the places I'm used to. They only offer the sauces (garlic, pineapple, chipotle, etc.) which are DIY.

I got the snapper and my husband got the pork porterhouse for our entrees. Both were delicious and so unique, but the porterhouse was one of the best things I've ever tasted. The Mac and cheese was great and the dessert good as well. People talk about this place being expensive but we found the prices to be very reasonable. Good food with quality ingredients shouldn't be \\"cheap\\". We will definitely be back. \\n\\nA side note about the service. \\nWe look young and have had some not good experiences at some local restaurants - I think they think we won't tip well.  But the guy who waited on us here was awesome! If he's working next time we go, we are asking for him."},{"name":"Go Fish Go Sushi","address":"363 S State St, Ste B","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm rating this 5 stars for what it is, every plate on the sushi belt is $1.50 with a drink order.  The fish is fresh, the dishes are colorful and my girlfriends and I go there often.  We have it down, we go at 11:45am or right at 12 noon and try to sit in front of the chef's counter to get first dibs on whatever is coming our fresh.  The belt is filled with all kinds of rolls and after some are taken, he puts out my fav salmon nigiri and others. Seaweed salad is good too.  As with any conveyor sushi, don't go for late lunch or dinner because choices are limited and here you pay regular prices if you order off the menu, so earlier/peak time is best."},{"name":"Boston Tea Stop","address":"54 Jfk St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Mmmm, the first time I went I got the taro milk tea at my friend's suggestion, and I liked it so much I haven't got anything else in all the times I've been there...except a side of mochi ice cream, which was also a nice treat. The Tea Stop has a ton of fruity flavors for the more adventurous and a frequent buyer card that will reward loyal customers.

Lucky us! I'm going to break down what we ordered because while all good, the quality (and volume) of each item we ordered varied a LOT. \\n\\nFirst - they bring you bread with an olive oil/olive tapenade that is really delicious. SO delicious in fact we are planning on making our own to keep around the house!\\n\\nWe ordered the following - Roasted Beets, Patatas Bravas, Oxtail, Calimari. Dessert  was Crema Catalina. \\n\\nRoasted Beets - I counted 5, 1/2\\" squares of beets, mayyybe a teaspoon of goat cheese, along with a plate full of arugula. This was the first dish that was brought to us and we thought \\"uh-oh\\". Nothing special about this dish and the level of ingredients plated was insulting. Will not order again. \\n\\nPatatas Bravas - GOOD. So good. Yummy fried potato cubes, spicy tomato sauce and what I initially thought was a lightly poached egg, turned out to be allioli (garlic mayo). Note to self - egg would be divine with this dish as well. Would be a great addition to the Alamo Drafthouse menu, I could see working on a bowl of these throughout a movie. \\n\\nOxtail - Yelp, I ordered this because of you. Everyone praised it as a must have. It was good, but not in the top three favorites of the day. I wish I had ordered something more interesting or with more flavor. We didn't finish this plate, we lost interest. \\n\\nCalamari - Served with a lime aioli. Large portion. Delicious. If you like calamari please order this. \\n\\nFor dessert I had the Crema Catalina, which is a toastedÔøΩ?cinnamon and lemon infused custard with caramelized crust. I love brulees, and this was nicely bruleed, very creamy, very tasty. It reminded me of a ginger cream cookie I have with my tea on occasion. \\n\\nAll in all it was very good, we will definitely go back to sample other items, as the menu is pretty substantial.  \\n\\nWe wanted to order the jamon Iberico but couldn't justify the price. Had it before elsewhere, will have it again, so the novelty tax wasn't worth it. \\n\\n3 out of 5 plates were quite enjoyable, so 3 out of 5 stars will be had.

We had the CHORIZO MOLOTES and they were tiny, lacked chorizo all we tasted was the masa and it was super bland; AGUACHILE was too salty and frankly kinda gross presentation and taste, the prawns were cut in a strange awkward way and again lacked flavor other than salt; SUADERO TACOS was the only dish that had any flavor and that I would get again but for $15 for quarter sized tacos I'd rather go to any taco truck and would find better tacos; FISH A LA DEVIL was just ok, really nothing special other than being over priced and again underwhelming. There's lots of great Tex mex and Mexican food here in Austin but this place misses the mark. The food is over presented and under flavored.

Good coffee.  Nice outdoor seating area.\\n\\nNow the BAD.  They must put a lot of love into their sandwiches because the place was not busy at all (I walked right up to the counter when I got in) and it still took FOREVER to get my sandwiches.  I literally watched the guy making my sandwich gingerly put each leaf of lettuce onto the top of the sandwich one at a time.  Seriously dude?  I had the curry chicken salad and the egg salad sandwich, and love is the only thing they put a lot of into the sandwiches because both were very meager considering their $8+ price tag (I don't remember the exact price and, wouldn't you know it, they don't have the prices on their website!).  Also, while the curry chicken salad was ok, the egg salad had way way way too much dill. The two sandwiches, two iced coffees, and a croissant came to almost $30.  So weak.\\n\\nNow the UGLY.

It's located in the Seoul Plaza, next to Treat your feet. Inside is very spacious with plenty of seats. Some couch seats and some hard metal seats. \\n\\nThey have variety of breads just like the other stores. Nothing special since they all come from the same place. What's special is their shaved ice. They have two types of shaved ice: regular Korean shaved ice where ice is more crunchy and snow shaved ice where ice is soft like snow. I personally like the Korean type shaved ice. I like to chew on my ice rather than have it melts in my mouth. I ordered the green Tea shaved ice. It has shaved ice too with red beans, Mochi, green tea ice cream, and condensed milk. Not much toppings but I don't mind since I'm all about the ice. I asked the lady to separate the red beans, mochi, and the ice cream which she did without hesitation. That's an awesome service! I love the shaved ice but it was bit too sweet. Next time, I might have to ask for condensed milk on the side too. Hahaha. \\n\\nAnother thing I like about this store is that, they are the only store that has a large iced green tea (24oz). Anytime I order from the other stores or white Windmill, they only served 16oz size. I mean it's not that hard!\\n\\nOne thing they could improve is the hours.

A flavor party in your mouth. \\n\\nBRAISED PORK BELLY BUN: Pork belly marinated in a soy ginger shallot marinade then braised to perfection and seared to make it crispy.

C'mon!  Too hungry at this point so we ordered and mentioned maybe that they should erase the clam special out front if they were out.

The interior looked really cozy and comfortable. (To begin with, I am quite protective of my sister and how people talk to her. She is the sweetest girl you will ever meet, so anyone who speaks to her without an ounce of respect is on my bad side. Also, I had just received my first Oregon speeding ticket on my way here. So, I'm slightly on edge already.) I walk in after my cigarette and my sister is at the counter with Rand. My first impression of Rand based on his facial expression when talking to my sister was prude and rude. When my sister finished up with him and sat down, she explained what had happened at the counter:\\n\\nRand, first of all, doesn't seem like the friendliest of people. My sister wanted a pot of tea, and apparently they don't do that here. Okay. That's understandable. She then asked for a second cup for me with some hot water, and he paused, glances at my sister, double taps this piece of paper on the post next to the register and says \\"I can't do that. I can give you a cup, but not water.\\" If he had said \\"I'm sorry, but we don't do that here,\\" then I would have no problem. But, he didn't. Next, he said that \\"people have been abusing this.\\" I'm sorry, but abusing what, exactly? Hot water? Do you charge for hot water? Is it against policy to rebrew a tea bag instead of wasting it? What exactly are people 'abusing?' You're charging $4 for a cup of hot water with a tea bag. So do other places. With the exception of: other places don't have hosts or hostesses speaking down to anyone; it's served in a pot; are willing to give you an extra cup; and aren't prude about their policies.\\n\\nI then go to the other gentlemen with the loose flowing hair and glasses. He is super nice. I asked for the other guy's name and he took his time to explain to me because I misheard it the first two times. Rand comes out from the back, and I ask him if he's the manager here. Verbatim, he also adds (in an extremely condescending manner) that he is \\"not only the manager but the owner.\\" I sit back down and take note of that, hence the first line in this review. About 30 seconds later he comes up to my table and asks \\"Did you have a question?\\" (Please assume that all these quotes I'm referring to are spoken in a condescending manner.) I say, \\"No, I just wanted your name.\\" \\n\\nPlease note that I am the kindest of people until someone talks down to me or anyone I'm with or know. Take a look back at my Yelp review history. I hardly write bad reviews. And I'm sitting in this cafe while writing this review. \\n\\nNow, we can talk about why I'm actually giving this place two stars (instead of one). I'm not that much of a harsh reviewer if you look at my history. The reason for the two stars is because of the other gentleman with the glasses being so polite, and the tea they serve is quite good. \\n\\nTL;DR: Owner has an attitude problem and speaks condescendingly. Tea is good.\\n\\nI want to understand your philosophy on \\"abusing a cup of hot water policy.\\" I understand that you would rather I buy another cup for myself. But, It's like saying I want the espresso grounds from my espresso shot, and you refusing and charging me for it. Also, why do other tea places offer the same amount, or even less than the amount of leaves you gave for the same price? I'm not from here, but Isn't the Portland philosophy all about being green? Shouldn't we reuse and recycle things that we are going to throw away? I'd rather reuse the same leaves to get more out of it, as opposed to wasting leaves for just one brew."},{"name":"Antique Table","address":"2 Essex St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4","text":"The service here was just awful.

Although we didn't have reservations, we were fortunate enough to get the last table for three in the small, but kitchy fun dining room.  Unfortunately, we were seated just after a large birthday party of about 10 people so our waiter was confiscated for most of the evening by them.  Though, I tended to notice that not only the two waiters on duty, but also the manager and the host were absent from the floor for most of our time there.  There seemed to be a party going on in the kitchen as i kept seeing drinks run from the bar to  behind the wall.  \\n\\nRegardless, when the cute waiter did show up he was friendly and efficient.  We ordered quickly and then waited..and waited..and waited for everything to show up.  Our margaritas, though potent, weren't to my taste.  My companions loved them, while i only thought they were mediocre. I much prefer the delicious concoctions of Polovo's or Trudy's - these seemed to be sour with an abundance of lime that over powered the flavor.\\n\\nOur busboy kept our waters full and handed out bread plates - but no bread. At the point that I was going to ask where our food was - it showed up with flourish.  The kitchen had sent everything out at once = apps and dinner - but all on a single beautiful texas inspired platter and the presentation was beautiful and appealing. While I thought the quesadilla of the day - shredded pork with black beans and whatever else - was bland I fell in love with the friend oysters.  Deliciously fried little light clouds served with complimentary dipping sauces.  Equally fun are the fish tacos, full of delicately batter tilapia and very filling for the price.  We also sampled the \\"divorced trout.\\" 2 fillets of trout, one battered and friend and the other grilled - served with rojo and tomitillo sauces that add to the flavors rather than hide as some sauces do.

However, I was not the biggest fan of them. They're giant potato wedges, not fries, and I got a bruised potato. The flavor is there and the texture of the potato is soft, but they were not the thin-cut fries I was expecting. \\n\\nI ordered the Fusilli & Rock Shrimp which is accompanied by roasted tomatoes, spinach, and arugula. For some reason I was really hoping it would be fresh arugula, but it wasn't. The fusilli pasta was great and had a chewy and bouncy-like texture to it. The shrimp was good, but nothing too extraordinary. \\n\\nThe service here is extremely nice, a little too nice, to the point where they want you to order more. Honestly, I'm good with just drinking water (tap water to be specific) and don't need to be asked 5x if I'd like to drink anything else.

Anyway enough reminiscing. \\n\\nMy Aunt raves about this place and I finally had the chance to dine here with her and was happy to agree with her hype. She ordered her usual, the chicken patacon, and I ordered the grilled tilapia salad. My Uncle ordered his usual which is the fried fish taco. We also started our meal with red Sangria and a tilapia ceviche. I must admit that the patacon sounded a bit odd to me with the pounded fried plantain as the base. My skepticism was not needed. The plantain base was a nice touch of sweetness and the texture was similar to a fried thick potato wedge with crispy skin. The toppings were fresh and flavorful and now I can understand why everyone raves about their signature cilantro sauce. I loved my salad. I'm so glad to have a salad to eat that doesn't taste like every other typical salad. I loved that the lettuce in the salad was shredded. Shredded salad lettuce makes me happy. The flavor of the fish was preserved because they did a nice salt/lime juice and didn't douse in a blend of seasoning. It was cooked perfectly as well. Not a touch of dryness. All of the elements in the salad came together very nicely (fresh cilantro, cilantro sauce, lime juice, tomato, fresh sliced avocado). The ceviche was refreshing and I have been craving a glass of that sangria ever sense. I didn't try my Uncles fish tacos but they looked great and I see it is a popular dish according to other reviews. I look forward to my next visit.

It's next to a few other eateries who share the common patio at Brookhaven Station with Mellow Mushroom and Pub71.. Hudson Grill has a decent array and set-up of TV's for sporting events and they have NFL ticket. They also have a relatively adequate bar in both the main and outdoor dining areas serving about 50 beers on tap. The dining room is not terribly unpleasing and it is comfortable. Everything after that goes downhill. The noise levels can peak to areas where discussions in normal volume isn't possible. The parking accommodations are tight and there is overflow parking at the bank across the street, where you are burdened of risking your life of crossing the street. They are owned by the same folks who bring us Cheyenne Grill, Joe's and Cowtippers. Unfortunately with that level of financial backing, they aren't interested in offering quality food or retaining the customer\\n\\nI have visited Hudson many times to catch NFL games or play trivia. I have always been reluctant to order food because of previous unpleasant experiences. The latest experiences further solidified this restaurant either lacks competence in the kitchen or don't give a s h i t  - or both. We 1st ordered the buffalo chicken wings covered wet. When they arrived, I had a few and noticed they were undercooked. There was noticeable fat between the skin and meat. Plus the meat around the joints didn't seem to be fully cooked. I sent those back and didn't make a big deal of it. There's no reason to give the server a hard time if food is not adequately cooked.\\n\\nStill being hungry, I order the burger and sweet potato fries thinking it can't be that terribly bad. Once it got to my table, the fries seemed; hell I don't know, but they were definitely not fresh. It seemed they were over-cooked, left out in the kitchen somewhere to become stale...I wasn't sure what was wrong with them. They had some weird coloration as well. I tried two and that was enough. The burger was medium rare to raw and I ordered medium. The middle was cold too. The bun wasn't fresh either and had a firm consistency. I have had fresher buns from the bakery. I asked the server to return that dish and just settled for beers. She was nice enough to remove the items from the bill and I left a decent tip for her trouble.\\n\\nMy recommendation, go across the way to Pub71 to grab your grub and then if you must see a sporting event on TV's head to Hudson."},{"name":"Wiener Wagon","address":"1199 Main St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"The Wiener Wagon has never failed for over 30 years.

As soon as I saw the name I was pretty sure we would be going to The Ravenous Pig. A quick perusal of yelp reviews and my suspicions were confirmed- this place was awesome. \\n\\nWe arrived around 7 and I was happy to see they have a valet instead of street parking- Winter Park being so hot right now I was worried parking would be a problem/I would have to remember where the car was which I hate. The valet took our car and suggested we get the foie gras (which we did) and we were at our table in under a minute. \\n\\nA side note on seating, we actually picked a booth in the bar area and I think that is actually preferable- it wasn't as bright in the bar, and it seemed to actually be quieter than it was in the main dining area. \\n\\nThe service was prompt and efficient. No complaints.\\n\\nHere is what we ordered:\\n\\nDrinks- We got the Wallflower (a ginger beer drink) and the Gin and Jam (which was made with rhubarb) - both were excellent. \\n\\nGruyere Biscuits- probably our least favorite thing but still pretty good. The butter they come with is a must.\\n\\nSnack Board- The ribs and fish on this were awesome. Pork rinds less so, but still good\\n\\nRoasted Foie Gras- this was killer. It comes with a  cinnamon toast crunch ice cream- and if that alone doesn't sell you on it than you have some serious issues. \\n\\nOrganic Fried Chicken- this was the stand out winner of the evening. It isn't actual whole pieces of chicken, its little circular pieces breaded around the edge- the chicken and breading was perfect. The creamed swiss chard it comes with though was even better than the chicken- and this is coming from someone who generally eats on average 0 vegetables per lifetime. \\n\\nSteak Frites- Ok let's talk about truffle fries. Usually when you get these what happens is there is a big pile of fries and then some sort of truffle flavored liquid has been dumped on top so you get like 10 fries that are deathly level of truffle flavor and then you have all the rest that are just regular fries. At The Ravenous Pig all the fries tasted exactly the same and had the perfect level of truffleocity. The steak was also extremely good but was not life changing the way the fries were.\\n\\nPig tails- this dessert is essentially curly funnel cake pieces with a chocolate dipping sauce- any Midwesterner would approve. \\n\\nOverall our experience at The Pig (yes, we are now on a first name basis) was very good. Is The Pig a 5 star restaurant? No, obviously not given that everything on the menu is less than 30 dollars. Is it way better than most restaurants that are similarly priced? Yes, yes it is."},{"name":"Alfredo's Italian Restaurant","address":"1989 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I had intended to give Alfredo's 4 Stars for the 1972 wood-panel decor and uncomfortably small bar area which will not accomodate all of the hungry, eager-to-be-seated patrons, but as it has been 3 days since I dined there and I am still thinking about how delicious my dinner was, an absolutely first rate pasta dish with an unctuous creamy tomato vodka sauce, I think 5 is appropriate after all.\\n\\nTo help explain why I am still fixated on my entree, I must explain my history with a perfectly made vodka sauce...\\n\\nMany years ago, in Longwood, Florida, there was a tiny little family owned Italian restaurant named Figaro which was \\"our\\" restaurant, and my now ex-husband and I went there every single week without fail. Hunter was an adventurous eater and would simply leave the decision making to the chef/ owner who continuously delighted him with creations that were the envy of the other patrons who smelt and saw them be delivered to us in the tiny 8 table max dining room. \\n\\nI, on the other hand, ordered the same thing every single time: penne al salmone, but made with chicken.  It was my first introduction to the lovely pinky-orange perfection which is a well-made tomato vodka sauce. For the 3 years we lived in our first home nearby, I ate that entree at least once a week.

The Parking lot is tight, probably only enough room for about 12 cars, but there's plenty of on street parking. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE/DECOR:\\nIt's pretty grungy in there, probably like hipster grunge, hmm, more like frat hipster grunge... \\"mixed frat hipster grunge\\" is my final answer. Basically it seems like it should be in the heart of Little Five Points instead of the Highlands, but I guess that just adds to the beauty of this establishment, and well I guess this is technically moreso OFW (Old Fourth Ward). This place it chill, laid back, and sorta chaotic all at the same damn time, I guess a \\"dive bar\\" is what you call it. Lots of drunk folks, people having funs, groups, singles, and couples. There's a back patio, but we didn't go back there. I could certainly smell the cigarette smoke though. And it's clear dog friendly since there was one guy who was walking his pit bull mix back and forth through the restaurant, I wouldn't bring my pampered pooch here though I wouldn't want her get dirty.\\n\\nFOOD: \\nWe ordered cheese pizza, veggie pizza, pesto pizza, and bbq chicken pizza (no pineapples, spinach instead), but instead of bbq chicken we ended up with the hawaiian pizza (no pineapples, spinach instead) (she got my order wrong). All of it was great, although the plain cheese pizza was seriously lacking in comparison to the others. \\n\\nThe slices are a big, this pizza is 100% foldable. The crust is thin, but not paper thin. I'm a fan of papa johns type crust thickness yanno that perfectly in the middle size crust. Although it was thin it was still good and had enough thickness to appease my crust preference palette. \\n\\nThey have many flavors-- besides the classic Supreme, Veggie, etc they have unique flavors like soul food, chill hot dog, big mama, and the hangover. Not to mention they offer a whole hosts of food types, like wings, pizza rolls, and even desserts... oh and of course alcohol, this place is just as much a bar as it is a pizza joint. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nThe girl who took our order was ok at best, but technically she was subpar considering she got one of the pizzas wrong. We ordered the bbq chicken she got the hawaiian,  my friend probably pointed to the order, but she should have repeated the order to ensure it was right. \\n\\nThere's a ton of guy servers and cooks and they all actually seem really cool, and some are actually kinda cute. They definitely all look like one crew-- tatted up, fitted pants, vintage t-shirts... they look very cool and definitely fit the look of this place. \\n\\nThe wait was quite long. I'm pretty positive we would have gotten our food quicker if we would have sat down. After waiting about 15 minutes, she said it would be about 15 minutes, but that turned into 30+ minutes easy. We probably waited an hour total for 4 slices of pizza on a Saturday night. \\n\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nDespite my order being mixed up, I have to still give them a decent rating, b/c the pizza they mixed it up with was really good. The wait was longer than told, the place is grungy and I walked out with my hair smelling like smoke, but even with all that the pizza was truly good. Definitely some of my favorite in the city. Let me be honest and say it's actually the best in the city imho (antico is just hype to me).

Food served wasn't authentic (I guess it's because it wasn't operated by a Japanese person...) \\n\\nFirst of all, my husband and I bought a Groupon ($59 for two) and thought that we had a deal; when we were there, we found out that fellow diners paid $30/ person for the same food with additional chicken (we had no chicken on our plate).. We found that was a rip off because we were paying $0.50 less per person but no chicken for us!!\\n\\nDuring the period of chef cooking, he seemed to have the least amount of teppanyaki knowledge; e.g. Using the same steel spatula on both raw chicken and Cooked steak/prawns/chicken at the same time... That's just common knowledge of food hygiene. Also when we mentioned the teppan wasn't clean enough before he started cooking (a few grains of cooked rice on the teppan), he was nice enough to turn the fire off and started using water and his steel spatula to scrape off the burnt food remnants, then using paper towel to wipe the teppan... However. He scraped the muddy water from the teppan into the trough in front of him, then into the drain.. I mean that's gross... because he used that same spatula to start cooking for us...

If the thought was to pay homage to all things pork, where then were all the pork dishes? Still, it's a catchy name.\\n\\nThe inside is nice, if not noisy. The restaurant is divided into a bar area and a seating area. The dark wood fits the image and the decor was well-conceived. The beer list was competent, but at a pub serving unique, craft beers, why include Brooklyn Lager as your lager choice? The wine list was fine and reasonably priced. Do not come here if you expect a multitude of wine choices or expense account wines.\\n\\nThe pretzels were disastrous. When your attempt to replicate a NY or Philly soft pretzel tastes no better than those available in the freezer aisle, why bother. There was no spin on the classic soft pretzel and it failed miserably. The Tuna carpaccio fared no better. There were so many competing flavors that that the fresh fish drowned. And by competing flavors, I do not mean in a good way.\\n\\nThe Fried Chicken was disappointing. First, why use a poussin (essentially a baby chicken) which has little meat and is impossible to eat. Second, the breading with a honey infusion was not flavorful. The honey at times drenched the breading causing it to lose its crunch. \\nMy friend had raves about his ribeye, but, alas, I did not sample it.

It's just that the circumstances haven't ever really presented themselves for me to try any of them AKA I'm always in the situation of \\"already haven eaten\\" whenever I pass by.  So it was a long-overdue indulgence when the opportunity finally did present itself.\\n\\nThe parking lot is deceptively suspect, because it's a one-way lot, and with the occasional bouts of cars that ebb and flow across North Decatur, simply trying to leave your spot isn't always the most convenient task in the world when you're boxed in by five cars simply trying to leave.  It's almost as if the place is better served for the vast foot traffic of general Decatur, as opposed to us who live and die by our automobiles.\\n\\nEither way, entering Doc Chey's, it's got a casual yet slightly hip ambiance, and the eloquently airbrushed artwork on the walls like to give off the impression that they somewhat have an edge.  But they're clean, and the restaurant doesn't seem overly crowded and seems to breathe easily, so I had a good feeling upon entering.\\n\\nOne thorough examination of the menu should be sufficient for most to get how the ordering process goes - choose your style of bowl, what kind of protein you want, what you want all your sauces and proteins on top of, and any additional veggies.  It's pretty simple for those not afraid of words.\\n\\nGiven the fact that I guess I'm used to Asian fare being slightly less costly than what Doc Chey's charges, my eyebrow arches a little seeing their prices.  Regardless, I also have to remind myself that I'm not a starving student anymore, and I can afford a $12 dinner whenever I please, so it's criticism not warranted.  Besides, the portions were just right, and I was able to walk out of the restaurant satisfied, but not feeling like a pig.\\n\\nAs for the food itself, it was above satisfactory, and I could easily see myself wanting to go back and try some of the other nationalities' styles.  I had gone with the Korean style, which was a pretty decent play on traditional bibimbap, in terms of sauce and spices, but still unique.

The cupcakes did look appealing. So I paid $4 for a small vanilla cupcake. This may be the first cupcake of my life that I've declined to finish. The outer rim had a crunch that I didn't really dislike but was totally not expected for a cupcake. I felt it was more similar to a piece of bread with frosting. Perhaps because most allergens aren't used it tasted different than the typical vegan baked goods I'm used to? I'm not sure but I was not impressed and I will not be back.\\n\\nUPDATE: I decided to give this place another try despite my previous comments because they are at every vegan festival I go to and although their booth is always free from lines (not a good sign) I decided to try them again to support vegan businesses. Sadly I was even more disappointed this time. The donut I had was the worst donut I've ever eaten. It is extremely dense and lacks flavor. I also tried their Mac and cheese and was super disappointed as well. It wasn't so horrible that I threw it out like the donut but I really did not enjoy it. I went home and added my own cheez sauce to it to finish it. Lastly, I tried a baked bread that looked really tasty (this is a change as some of their other stuff doesn't look so great) but unfortunately the bread was rubbery.

I wanted to like this place.  I went there somewhat regularly when they first opened, despite the fact that it was constantly very crowded and the bar is so small that it was nearly impossible to get a stool.  \\n\\nHowever, here is the problem:  they are trying too hard to make everything on the menu hip and \\"artisinal,\\" but not doing a very good job of it.  The mac and cheese has chewy unappealing pork belly in it - God forbid they just use delicious crispy bacon.  The chicken sandwich is actually one of the few normal good things on the menu, but they don't have ranch or honey mustard - they make their own sauces that are not good (there is a buttermilk dill sauce that is a terrible substitute for just plain old good quality ranch dressing).  \\n\\nEven worse, I tried to give this place one last undeserved chance and ordered a breakfast sandwich the other day.  The \\"breakfast sammy\\" on the menu has kale.  Who puts kale on a breakfast sandwich?  Naturally when calling in the order I asked them to hold the kale and the \\"maple chili mustard\\" (whatever that is).  All I wanted was eggs bacon and cheese.  After placing the order with the host I got a call back because THEY WOULD NOT TAKE THE KALE OFF MY BREAKFAST SANDWICH!!  The host gave some excuse about no being able to modify the sandwich, I wasn't really paying attention because I felt like I was in the twilight zone. \\n\\nThe same over-the-top attempt to be trendy and cool similarly infects the tap list.  Maybe mix in a couple normal, mainstream, good beers (i.e. Newcastle) with the smoked-maple-bacon-and-coffee porter...\\n\\nAnyway, my rant is over.

They had a bunch of stuff on the menu, and much of it isn't really Mexican food, which is fine, but I am uppity about my Mexican food.

I'm not sure it knows. The look leans towards a convivial space with a certain southern charm but then there were things that were totally at odds with the environment. Like old blues music (which I normally love) playing outside, but it sounded like it was coming from a cranked up boom box sitting on a table somewhere. Inside the colors and lighting were muted/hushed in the dining room where we were seated, but the size/placement of tables was an incongruous mix of large groups, along with small tables whose diners seemed to want a more intimate experience. But the outside tables lining the porch... they looked like they had their vibe down pat (except for the boom box ;)\\nThe food--good overall but again oddly inconsistent (except the steak, that was just bad...you shouldn't have to saw a $38 steak--but the arugula salad that came with it--great). Fried chicken coating one of the best I've had, but it needed salt (and none on the tables). Baby spinach good--its dressing tasty but so overpowering I didn't finish what is my favorite vegetable. Mashed potatoes great taste--consistency kind of pasty. \\nThere's more, but point probably made.

The short ribs seamed like very tiny leftovers from larger cuts of ribs and it was full of chewy tendon bits. Constantly picking out fat and small bone from my mouth. Which was a bummer because the sauce was pretty good. And Xiao Long Bao's were just okay and could be a lot better had they allow their customers to poor their own soy sauce/vinegar mixture for dipping. They give you a tiny portion, which they didn't give at all last time so it was nice to see, but no way is it enough. \\n\\nWe also ordered the XO dumplings which was new from last time We thought it would be a spicy version. That's what we wanted! We wanted a little kick to our meal. We tried the XO which we thought would be special but honestly, it was kind of gross. Not sure if they all have seafood in them, or if there was a language barrier, but my wife and I could only eat 2 out of the 6. Our meal ended quickly after. The highlight of the meal were the green beans. Very tasty!\\n\\nAnd finally, I know the proper way to eat dumplings is with tea, but it blows my mind they don't offer anything else to drink besides that and water.

My husband and I had friends from VT down. We decided to venture out to backbay. Dillons seemed like a good choice as it was a beautiful, sunny day...especially for November.  They have an outdoor space and large open windows.. Immediately,  the manager told us that we wouldn't be able to sit outside all day. Strange, as I'm fairly certain he was unable to predict how long everybody would stay, but alright, whatever. We said fine, we'll sit by the windows.  We asked if we could put two tables together and put a chair on the end to accommodate our party of five.  After he rolled his eyes and pointed out that most of the chairs available at the bar were being saved, I asked about a chair at the end of the bar. He said fine and brought it over for us. So, to begin with, we had a bit of a sour taste in our mouths.  The server approached us within the first five minutes to take our drink order. However, it took a solid 20 minutes for the drinks to get to our table. Keep in mind, three of these were laguanitas drafts, one a screwdriver, and the last a canned cider. Once we received these, it took another 15 minutes to get our waters. Our server meekly apologized,  explaining that the bar was backed up. I could understand if the bar was three or even two people deep, but not even every seat at the bar was taken. The food took an easy extra 25 minutes. I will say, the spinach and artichoke dip, and buffalo chicken bites were tasty, and absolutely the highlight of the entire experience.  The tostadas were just soggy nachos and the pizza was mediocre at best. Any time we needed anything, including another round, and the check, the server took an absurd amount of time to get what we needed to the table. We ended up telling 6 people in line to go elsewhere. They thanked us and did just that.  Overall, the amount of time that we waited for everything,, the managers apathetic attitude, mediocre food, and the lack of remorse from our server earns them one star.

Not knowing what anything was on the menu I just proceeded to pick things at random. It sounded like my granny and I at Bingo. A7, B33,C51 and so forth.

If I remember correctly this was a Panda Express at one time so I'm glad to see something useful and tasty occupying this space. Moving on the food and as I check my camera shots we started with two steamed buns filled with BBQ pork and mushroom and chicken. I wasn't crazy about the pork; but the chicken variety was really delicious. These buns seem like a patent infringement on the kolaches just down the road at Lone Star. \\n\\nI then sampled the open face steamed chicken \\"Siu Mai\\" as they were out of my first choice. Steamed meats aren't for everyone I guess. Call it a texture \\"thing\\" if you will. Good flavor yet somewhat in the Spam category. It wasn't bad; just not what I expected. My next random choice was the stuffed eggplant and shrimp. Finally, something fried! This dish was worth the visit with its delicate batter and tangy sauce. A deep fried morsel will always be common ground for me. Next on the random sampling was the \\"Cha Siu\\" noodle wraps similar to crepes with pork and soy sauce.

This meant that servers were constantly hovering and refilling water, which was a bit awkward, especially if you're like me and feel the need to say \\"thanks\\"...every single time.  \\n\\nBeing pad thai fanatics, neither of us could be persuaded by anything else on the menu.

The swimming rama was also tasty, but the pad thai was the clear winner. Hopefully, we will be able to break free from the grips of pad thai to order more broadly off the menu for future visits. I also heard the server saying that most menu items can be made vegetarian, by subbing tofu in place of meat.

The bartender happily replaced with loaded baked which was delicious.  Service was just ok at first then changed to very friendly, maybe due to my obvious interest in the beer selection.

The veggie dumplings were pan fried however the dough was uncooked ($7.00).   The chicken dumplings arrived in red dough, which was weirdly interesting however the dumpling flavor was bland ($6.50).   We enjoyed the Emperor dumplings ($9) filled with beef, shrimp, and pork.  Loved the rough-cut raw ginger garnish.  The Hot and Sour soup was tasty however it was served tepid rather than nice and hot.

Mac along with the Midtown location. Tonight we came to the Lindbergh location. Now I've given T. Mac PLENTY of opportunities before I offered this one star review, but the establishment hardly, if ever, rises to the occasion.\\n\\nFor tonight's visit, we came and and were seated promptly. Our server Sha'Vonne came quickly, but that was the first of only two things she did quickly this evening. We ordered fountain beverages to start, along with the queso con carne. The queso came before our sodas did, and the queso was gone before the sodas arrived. My throat was being scorched by fresh jalape√±o seeds before she made her way back to the table. \\n\\nOnce she did bring the beverages, she said \\"I'll be back\\" (though we had long decided on entrees) and immediately went over to a neighboring table (which she spent more time at the entire evening, though we were seated first and were not difficult at all) Another 5 minutes pass (about 20 minutes seated in the restaurant at this point with no entree order placed) and she's back to take our orders. \\n\\nI ordered the Hickory burger, medium, and also convinced one of my buddies to do the same. I ordered regular fries with my burger and my buddy ordered sweet potato fries. My order came back with sweet potato fries, presumably the kitchen's fault as my ticket didn't reflect that mistake. I let the runner who dropped our food know that I did not want sweet potato fries (since Sha'Vonne was nowhere to be found, oh wait, she was at the other table where she spent the majority of our visit.) The food runner whisks away the sweet potato fries and says he will get me my regular fries. another twenty minutes pass and no fries. \\n\\nSha'Vonne shows up and clears the table and I let her know I want my regular fries, and she and in two minutes I have a small plate of COLD regular fries. Take note that the sprite she brought me initially, was the ONLY one I got. I wanted to order alcohol but when I saw that we were not even gonna get minimal attention, I declined. MY buddy had to ask for a glass of water twice before he received it, which was after she cleared the table and was bringing the check.\\n\\nRemember, I mentioned that there were two things she did quickly, the first was coming to the table quickly. The second was bringing the check. That is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. You been slow to the table the entire evening, but can whip the check out in a matter of seconds?! Not acceptable!\\n\\nMy burger was delicious, but the competitive edge for any business is the PEOPLE. I don't have a problem with the food at Taco Mac and if the food was the only deciding factor, this customer would not be lost. But its not the only deciding factor. SERVICE is HUGE and I just consistently receive subpar service. And I think I may be done with T.Mac at this point...\\n\\nI hesitate on reviewing chains, because ultimately nothing will change. But this one star review comes after numerous visits to Atlanta area Taco Mac restaurants and receiving average service at best! I still tipped Sha'Vonne her 20% but this will not end here. I'm tired of giving them my money and receiving low quality in return.

We were greeted late from a female server who was steadily sweeping her section (tables, booths brooms were out from several staff members who had to have noticed we were there) until she noticed we were there. Our greeting (finally) was prompted with an immediate notification of the kitchen was closing and we needed to get our order in as soon as possible.  We ordered and food and drinks came out in a timely fashion. Which is a plus. But we never saw our waitress until she presented the check. It took an additional 10 minutes for her to come back by and retrieve our payment. She seemed occupied with other staff members in the back corner of the store (near the wataburger side). Not to mention the Kitchen music was audible from the dining room which means to tell me that when the doors shut to the outside, there is no awareness to the customers who are inside (from the manager to the staff). It's everyone for themselves. Aggravated we signed out credit card and left. We have yet to return to your locations or have no desire to visit future locations. I hope this is something that y'all can take and coach your team on. It looks like y'all are everywhere here in Austin and business is good. Opening another location right next to my place of work.

We both agreed that our drinks were great (Margherita & Bahama Mama) and we ordered an appetizer (calamari) along with our main course and the next thing the waitress brought (to my friend) was a little bowl of coleslaw.  The appetizer never came (I actually forgot about it myself) and we ordered a 2nd round of drinks (good again) then our meals came - we both happened to order the same dish (Wood-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops) - the first thing I noticed is that everything on the plate was small or tiny lol.  So I was disappointed (to me it was not worth the steep-ish price).  My 2 sides (green beans & rice) were both good.  We reminded our waitress that we never got our appetizer (I won't name her).  After we finished our main course she showed up with the appetizer- but in a shopping bag (even though I never asked for it to be \\"to go\\").  I shrugged my shoulders and told her I needed to order desserts (to go).  She gave us an extra dessert which was nice (I ordered 4).  At home I was impressed with the dessert I ate (key lime pie) but it too was on the small side.  Too bad the service was lacking and the portions/sizes were small.  I think a better name for them is \\"Kid's Lobster\\" - I can't take RL very seriously.  Now for the drinks, I give them 4 stars!

It wasn't fresh or sweet, but I can get over that and will definitely go back!"},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"60 Newport Ave","city":"Quincy","stars":"2.5","text":"Copying and pasting a letter I sent directly to Chipotle's Customer Service. This is a true story:\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nI normally don't complain about restaurants because living in the city means you are often visiting restaurants that are dingy, smelly and have poor sanitation... but, I hold Chipotle to a much higher standard and I figured it was worth submitting this feedback for the sake of future customers as well as the restaurant itself. I will submit the following pros and cons:\\n\\nPros:\\n- Great food as always\\n\\nCons:\\n- I walked in and the entire place wreaked of sweat and mold. I figured it was just the entrance way but the smell persisted through the entire restaurant. I figured I'd blame it on the customers in line who may have had some body odor, but when I sat down with my wife to eat the food I couldn't enjoy the food because the smell was so strong.\\n\\n- There were no forks... Minor complaint, but worth mentioning?\\n\\n- The bathrooms were disgusting. I have been to restaurants where the bathroom was gross but I've never experienced one this disgusting at a Chipotle. It smelled of urine strongly and there was trash everywhere.\\n\\n- The thing that disturbed me the most was that while I was waiting in line, I noticed one of the staff who were helping wrap burritos pull her pants up (while having her gloves on) and proceeded to continue serving and wrapping burritos with the SAME GLOVES. I worked in food services for four and a half years and we got SMOKED by our managers if we didn't change our gloves often and frequently. I should have said something but I figured I'd get bad service if I asked the woman to change her gloves so I just kept my mouth shut. \\n\\n- Staff overall seemed tired, exhausted, and not very happy to be there. That affected the way they served our food. I just found this to be odd because every Chipotle I have been to in Boston (Watertown, Central Square, Harvard, BU, Brighton) has had extremely friendly servers who seemed genuinely happy to be there. The customer service is always what I've appreciated about Chipotle and there wasn't much customer service here at all. \\n\\n- We waited about 10-12 minutes for our turn to get food. I don't mind waiting, but this is uncharacteristic of Chipotle as I have been to Chipotle in Central Square during lunch hour (the busiest hour) and it never took more than 5 minutes for me to get to ordering.\\n\\nAgain, I wish I had voiced these complaints to the manager on duty but I guess I was so infuriated and I didn't want to cause any trouble or discourage any of the employees that I just quietly ate (whatever I could stomach eating) and left.\\n\\nMy wife and I went on Yelp after to see what the rest of Boston and Quincy was saying about this particular location and many of our complaints seem to be echoed here. I always take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt as they are usually written by people with way too much time (that's what I say)- but I guess I've become one of those people who really felt like this restaurant needs a change in managers/ownership or SOMETHING- this restaurant should NOT BE CALLED \\"CHIPOTLE.\\"\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read this- grateful!\\n\\nSincerely,\\nMoses P."},{"name":"Taco-Miendo","address":"2015 W Parmer Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Always friendly and always good food.

We went with the nonna's meatball  trio and tuna three ways for appy. The meatball were huge and I really like the seared tuna the most amongst the three way. We were relatively full with appies but was happy and to see and taste the beautifully presented entrees which included the beef shank, plin and burrata and the duck breast pizza. There were actual large generous slices of duck breast on the pizza which was a very unique and tasty treat! The beef the shank was tender and it was great how it is deboned already for messy eaters like me . Only suggestion is it could add a bit more sauce to the meat to add more flavour to the dish. The tirimisu dessert was one of my favourite parts where it can fool you as a cute potted plant! It not only look good but taste good!

The sponsor booked a hotel at the Taj Boston and I stayed here overnight yesterday and checked out around noon this afternoon. Everything here has been immaculate from service to food to venue. The only reason that I'm not giving this hotel its final star is because of the African American/Black (I did not capture his name) older bellhop who embarrassed me in front of a full lobby about having my feet crossed on a chair that was across from the concierge. He said, \\"We just cleaned the chairs... could you...\\" while walking AWAY from me toward the elevators. I'm a young female who looks about 18 years old when in casual and comfy (my preferred) clothes. In reality, I'm a successful 24 year old graduate student who does not need to be \\"put in my place\\" by ANYONE. No matter who or what you are. So I highly suggest that the next time this gentleman (gentle should probably be excluded) thinks he's being gracious to the hotel or hotel staff, he should truly think twice. I understand that my shoes being on the chair might have been a major faux pas, but I don't think it's appropriate to call anyone out, especially a hotel guest. Just grin and bear it.

I was sold on the balcony and would sacrifice the smaller bed. \\n\\nWe got up to the room and there turned out to be no balcony, and the room was only \\"bigger\\" because there's a couch, two chairs, a desk, and a dining room table -- all things we did not need so much.

I have lived in Orlando for about 6 years and have eaten my way around this town in and out. Fine dining to food trucks and everything in between. I'm a self proclaimed foodie that works in food service. I travel. I eat. \\n\\nLets get to the goods. Winnie's. Orlando's Chinese food offerings leave much to be desired. Being a Jersey boy I am always looking for good sit down Chinese. After 6 years I have finally found \\"my spot\\". \\n\\nThis place looks very unsuspecting from the outside, but is very inviting when you enter the door. Tastefully decorated. Clean smelling. I was instantly excited. Greeted by my would be server I was seated quickly at a very comfy booth. The server was very playful and accommodating. I was excited to see shrimp toast on the menu and quickly ordered that as my appetizer. You can rarely find that in Orlando and I LOVE shrimp toast. As I continued to look over the menu I believe the owner came out to let me know that they were out of shrimp toast! While disappointed I was so happy to see the owner at the table and she made a few suggestions. I was heavily swayed to try the house made shrimp egg roll. Let me tell you that I don't think I could have been happier that they were out of shrimp toast. It was amazing. I make egg rolls. Damn good ones. This made me want to give up making egg rolls. As the egg rolls came out I decided on my entree of Spicy Shrimp and Chicken with cashews. They serve brown rice or jasmine rice with their entrees, but I opted for some veggie fried rice. While waiting for my food I was engaged in conversation with my server as well as another gentleman I believed to be related to the owner. Both were very funny and playful throughout my dining experience. When my food arrived there was a slight \\"delay\\" between the entree and the rice coming out. Maybe 5 minutes. When the rice came out she said, \\"don't worry, I'll get you some dessert for the wait\\". The wait? Really? I was blown away. I thanked her and dug into my meal. The shrimp and chicken were cooked perfectly as were the accompanying vegetables. Just the right amount of flavorful and slightly spicy sauce. The veggie fried rice had great flavor and was not oily at all. As I was finishing up they brought me a complimentary dessert. I am not a huge fan of tiramisu, but this one was quite good. It wasn't house made, but very tasty for a frozen dessert. \\n\\nIt was a little pricey for \\"basic\\" Chinese food, but this place is not doing anything basic.

The tiger skin chocolate cake is really pretty but it has a lighter cocoa taste compared to Western-style chocolate cakes. \\n\\nI like that the bakery is open until quite late, meaning I can get a quick pastry fix anytime that I'm in the area.

The food started to arrive within minutes, but most of it had no flavor, or didn't taste very good.  And the noise - worse than before, almost painful.

I also found random bits of other salad at the bottom (stray tomato, crouton, and a little cheddar cheese) as if they'd begin making a different salad in the bowl and changed midstream.   Ugh.

I was sick of the food court offerings at the Prudential Plaza (my jail cell away from home) and dinner time was coming to a close without a single morsel of sweet crustacean delight. \\n\\nWeak from my diet's lack of lobster and other salt water-dwellers, I agreed to walking down to Cactus Club. I don't normally enjoy margaritas or the standard blah Tex Mex fair. Not to mention, seafood. But slap my fanny and call me Crazy, I was wrong on both counts. \\n\\nWe got there close to midnight and were still able to get a table in the bar area, which is separated from the larger dining room. We had queso with refried beans (so many noms), guacamole (more noms), and I had the quesadilla with... can you guess?? Yes that's right, grilled shrimp. Big, plump, juicy, JUST grilled to cooked shrimpies. And cilantro and grilled onions. CC offers a \\"build your own\\" quesadilla section, which is brilliant, and each quesadilla comes with two toppings. I sprung for the cilantro as a third choice and I'm glad I did. This quesadilla with its multi cheesy gooyness and crispy exterior was a total win for me. \\n\\nEven more surprising, I loved my margarita. I have tequila running through my veins but I don't normally care for its signature cocktail because I don't like sweet beverages, and restaurants love the sugary add-ons in a cocktail. CC used basic, clean ingredients and therefore the tequila actually shown through. They were out of Julio blanc and recommended the Milagro blanc, which was a really nice substitute. \\n\\nThe only draw back was the service. The poor bartender was also moonlighting as our server, along with every other  table in the bar. She did a great job at keeping up, but she clearly needed up.

The wings are baked and they are on the small side but surprisingly I actually liked them!  And on Mondays they are 1/2 off so you can get 10 for $4 (they only come in orders of 10).  The calzone was also delicious, and the most delicious of it all was the SAUCE.  I am a sucker for saucy concoctions and their marinara seriously kicks ass.  The general knowledge trivia was heavily skewed in my opinion (not sure if that is how it usually goes), but the cartoon trivia is fun.  The patrons here also seemed pretty diverse so that is another plus.

The menu is quite restricted from its full one, but the wraps themselves are astoundingly delicious. I've had the Gangsta Wrap and Wrappers Delight, and the tempeh bacon in the latter is one of my favorite things now. I couldn't really tell between the different sauces and flavors in the Gangsta Wrap because there was a lot going on in such a small area, but the taste overall was still great. Mind you, this filling is all wrapped in a flaky, toasted tortilla mmm.\\n\\nOne star off because while the food is topnotch, it's a little shy of being worth the price. For the size you get I'd say $6 is reasonable, but $7-$8 is pushing it (I realize many people might think \\"it's just $2...\\" but alas, I am a college student). I'd love to eat an excessive number of Gangsta Wraps and also support a new food truck, but I can get a more filling sandwich at Bon Me next door for less, so in the meantime these will remain mini-splurges for me."},{"name":"Bloc Somerville","address":"11 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Ashamed to admit that for as long as I've been exploring the nooks and crannies of Union Square, this past weekend marked the first venture in to the (literal) vault that is Bloc 11.\\n\\nIt's a sleek, sexy coffee shop that's modern and somewhat icily hip. Almost too streamlined with an industrial, no-softness approach you'd expect from a cafe phoenix born from the ashes of an old bank.\\n\\nThe line (there's always one) splits at a fulcrum of pastries and today's blends to form two distinct paths. I tell you this so you know when your drink is called, it will be on the side from which it was ordered. May seem obvious, but you'd be surprised at how many patrons found themselves doing laps for their medium chai latte.\\n\\nPrices are on par with an trendy java hut ($3-6 for two sizes of the bean or the leaf) and the pastries ride in same range. Our blueberry scone - not a contender for the 2011 SconeOff, but very well could have been - had a more cohesive, almost bready texture and massive, abundant berries throughout. Delicious, even in spite of an unnecessarily sweet icing (perhaps make it a drizzle?).\\n\\nWhile waiting for our chai and hot chocolate, we took time to explore the dining space in the rear, which actually seemed a little more cottage-like. That is, until you meander past the giant vault door and into a rightfully warm set of benches, positioned lovingly where safe-deposit boxes and enormous wealth once resided. Kitschy, and kind of just there because it always been, but oh so cool. Outdoor seating for all-season al fresco sippage adds a nice touch.\\n\\nHer chai was too weak and watery, which on the plus means it's brewed to order (not Oregon mix) but on the negative means it's too weak and watery. On the flip, my hot cocoa sat rich and thick on the tongue, and had a pleasantly sweet foam I totally mustached.\\n\\nSo far, this is the cafe of choice for morning walks through Union, and I'd love to return for a lunch sandwich (variety, all $9).

I had pretty high expectations after reading the reviews on Yelp and also the review in this week's Columbus Dispatch (3.5 out of 5). I was so hoping to find a great Italian place that is closer to home than Moretti's on Sawmill.  Moretti's on Sawmill is the Italian restaurant in Columbus to which I compare all others.  Unfortunately my wish did not come true.\\nWe did get seated immediately at 5:30 on a Saturday night but we did notice the many empty booths that had 'reserved' signs on them. We were told that they were reserved for the many 6:00/6:30 reservations. So, just a note to those of you wanting to try this place, reservations are a good idea as it is very small with limited seating.\\nMy true test of Italian restaurants is their bread, wedding soup (cup=$3.50, bowl = $4.50) and Spaghetti with Meatballs ($12.95) - so that is what I ordered.  The bread was outstanding - definitely some of the best Italian bread I have had in Columbus.  The wedding soup was a little salty but I honestly didn't have much of a chance to explore the flavors as the cup was so tiny and only about halfway filled; it was gone in 5 spoonful's.  The croutons provided on the side were a nice touch but they literally soaked up almost half of what little soup there was in the cup.  The homemade spaghetti was cooked perfectly, and the meatballs were pretty good, but the tomato sauce was very thick and almost sweet (it reminded me of a pizza sauce) with A LOT of black pepper.  I personally prefer the garlic to add a little 'heat' to the sauce, not a ton of black pepper.  My husband had the Chicken Caprice ($15.95), his only comment was that it was 'OK'.\\nI think I will just continue to make the drive to Moretti's on Sawmill......."},{"name":"Hyatt Regency Orlando","address":"9801 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"An absolutely stunning hotel with lots of history.

Very exciting to have another nice restaurant to frequent! Carroll's has an open airy dining room and a spacious bar with plenty of TV's for you sports fans out there. It's nothing spectacular, but certainly great for Medford. I actually prefer eating in the lively bar area over the dining room. We sat there for a good while and the bar continues to get pretty crowded going into the night on a Friday. Atmosphere...check. \\n\\nSo I'm going to have to disagree with some of the past reviews that Carroll's is overpriced. They have a wide range of items on the menu that run the price gamut. Burgers + Fries for $9-$11, steak tips for $16, and yes, seafood dishes rounding out around $20-ish. Appetizers are really reasonably priced too. \\n\\nWe had a sample of the raw bar, mussels, spicy calamari, cobb salad w/shrimp. Everything was delicious - mussels were nicely cooked with wine, garlic, and onions. The sauce accented the mussels so you could taste the mussels while getting a hint of the other flavors. Spicy calamari was fried perfectly where there was a nice crunch without being greasy. Cobb salad was good - nothing really stood out, but overall a nice salad. Our friend had steak tips which she raved about and everyone at the table tried and yes, they were that good.\\n\\nLastly, you HAVE to try the icecream sundae. It is out of this world!

So they technically opened at 5 pm for dinner but at 4:50 there was already a line outside! (Tip: show up early and line up! The line continues and gets worse during dinner time.) We were the third group in line and got seated pretty quickly. Ended up ordering steamed pork dumplings, pork and shrimp shomai, honey garlic spare ribs, and chicken friend rice. Everything was soooo delicious!! The only thing we didn't get to order was the pork with sauce and steamed buns because they said it would be a 40 minute wait which was crazy. The steamed dumplings and shomai was to die for, personally like the dumplings better tho. My favorite was the honey garlic spare ribs. They tastes sweet and delicious, would definitely recommend!!  For two people we spent about $50 including tip, which might seem a lot but we did order A LOT hahah. \\n\\nWe also went back the next day which was Saturday, Chinese New Yew. We couldn't show up early and didn't have a reservation so I was already worried about the wait we would have to go through. I figured dumpling house on Chinese New Year = long wait times. We got there about 5:45pm and I was right, there were groups in front of us waiting to still be seated. But to my surprise the wait didn't feel that long maybe 20-25 min max. Maybe it was because we were only a two person group. And we basically ordered the same exact thing because we freaking loved it so much hahah. Except this time we ordered the pork with sauce and steamed buns (it was only a 20 min wait! Instead of 40 minutes the day before). Food was great ,again. \\n\\nThey only loose a star for customer service (ish). I actually called the second day we went to make a reservation for later that night to avoid waiting but the lady on the phone said that reservations were all full, yet when we went there we sat closer to the front where the lady who seats people and answers the phone, and I over heard her still far reservations for that night. I was a little annoyed but I just ate my frustrations away with my spare ribs. The waitresses also made us felt like we were rushed to order but I can also understand because it was a packed house for both nights. \\n\\nOverall, a great dumpling/ Chinese restaurant. The ambiance is casual but their decor on the inside is actually very modern and nice. I would say price is decent for the food (ex: steamed pork dumplings were $6.50 I think? And shrimp and pork shomai were $7something) \\n\\nDefinitely a must try if in Vancouver!"},{"name":"Cypriana","address":"505 Semoran Blvd","city":"Casselberry","stars":"3.5","text":"I would love to give this place a great review, but will have to try it again to increase my star rating.

As the adventurous eater matures he zigzags across the culinary landscape, tasting...er...testing the waters of food from around the world. A likely course may lead one first to Mexico, then China, India, Japan (teriyaki), Vietnam, back to Japan (sashimi this time), and then to Africa for Moroccan and Ethiopian fare. The wayfarer on this journey might conclude they did the 'Asian thing' and moved on to the dark continent.\\n\\nAdmittedly, one's route is influenced by the ethnic populations nearby. If you live in Antler, ND your culinary globe trotting probably starts with Dairy Queen and ends with Taco Hell (n√©e Bell). Given the Boston metro area's size and ethnic variety your journey can be exotic and long. And don't forget to stop in Cambodia.\\n\\nMittapheap in Lynn, MA is a nice example of what Cambodian food has to offer. It has a very large menu that touts it's Cambodian fare but also includes Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese. My journey had already been through the latter so I was headed to Cambodia.\\n\\nDid I say the menu was large? It must have had at least 100 items. It is filled with plenty of unfamiliar words and ingredients but the thoughtful owners include a picture of almost every item. Looking at the pictures and picking up the aroma from the kitchen makes the experience feel like smell-a-vision. My cheerful waitress was more than happy to help me choose the right 'channel.'\\n\\nThe restaurant is larger than I expected, based on the small storefront facing the street. It can seat about 80 people. The dining room is clean and quaintly appointed with Cambodian art, images and idols.\\n\\nI arrived at 11:30 AM on a Sunday and a handful of tables were occupied. My two sons (10 and 7) and I were the only gringos, everyone else here was ordering in their native tongue. While not crowded the place felt busier due to the steady stream of patrons arriving for take-out.\\n\\nMy boys are often reluctant to accompany me on culinary expeditions. I lured them in for this one with the promise of chicken wings and white rice. They made me promise not to trick them with any 'secret ingredients.' In previous excursions I've snuck items into their mouths such as rabbit, pig ears and blood pudding, but that's another story.\\n\\nI kept true to my word and they were delighted to see plain old fried chicken wings arrive with a heaping bowl of sticky and fragrant white rice. The boys were happy with their choice but I was less so. These were not wings from the plumpest of chickens. \\n\\nThe New York Times recently ran a story on the increasing cost of wings. It's your basic supply and demand problem. It looks like Mittapheap is settling for wings from the lower end of the quality spectrum. They were ultra-cripsy on the outside and tender on the inside but they just weren't meaty enough. The boys didn't complain.\\n\\nI told our waitress I wanted something Cambodian, that I love soups and I love spicy. She steered me to the Cambodian Sour Soup (Somlor Machu Kroung) which is described on the menu as a \\"popular Cambodian style soup flavored with lemon grass and various Asian herbs with water grass and jalape√±os.\\" You choose the protein - chicken, fish, beef, tripe or pork. I chose the squealer. \\n\\nWhen she returned with the soup she placed an enormous crock in front of me. It is large enough for two diners and probably over a quart in total volume. \\n\\nIt had a wonderful aroma of lemon. The broth was cloudy with pulverized lemon grass and accented with kaffir lime leaves. This was not like a Vietnamese pho or Chinese noodle soup - there were no noodles. It was just chock full of diced pork, string beans, greens and very hot spices. I wanted spicy and I got it. By the time I finished eating I looked like I'd run a marathon. And I loved it.\\n\\nThe soup was rich with flavor and the meat was mostly tender. The color and texture of the meat varied so I'd guess they are using varied cuts. A few of the darker pieces were a bit too tough. The bowl was so big that I just avoided those and stuck to the lighter pieces.\\n\\nI cooled down with a Thai iced tea which included bobas. They have a complete menu of Asian bubble teas, or smoothies.\\n\\nMy first trip to Mittapheap was a success and I can't wait to bring a bring group of fellow adventurers here soon.

Busy but inefficient. Pricey, but chintzy portions. Servers are very distracted. Tables jammed together - way too close to be able to move without banging into other diners - cram as many tables together as possible in order to serve more? Awkward serving plates & bowls that are way too deep to use a fork, but no spoons. Nothing added to our entree: nobody asked if we would like an appetizer, or a salad, or a side vegetable, or a starch, or bread, or even coffee after our meal. Our feeling was that our server was just trying get through the night as quickly as possible, without any headaches. Would it be too much to ask if we would like a salad? Or some bread? Or crackers? Evidently yes. Just get the orders in; get the food out; and hope no one asks for anything else. On top of this place doing everything on how to not operate a fine-dining restaurant, not one of our meals measured up: over-cooked duck; under-cooked fish; lukewarm soup.

We went the first time right after the hurricanes and quite a few items were out of stock. They get most of their products from local grown farmers and vendors in the area. We had a groupon which was well worth the money. On our first visit we went on a Saturday afternoon between lunch and dinner. I opted for the 1/2 chicken with polenta and sausage. They were out of the sausage but you honestly didn't need it in the dish. I have never had a more moist piece of chicken in my life. I am not a dark meat person but this was amazing. The polenta nice and creamy was also served with an array of caramelized carrots. Chef Bruno himself came over to apologize for not having all the ingredients and offered us some drinks on the house to make up for it. We decline but loved the touch. The hubby being the vegetarian that he is, went with the pizza that he thoroughly enjoyed. We also, opted for the chocolate lava type cake clearly made on premises. On our second occasion, we went again on a Saturday afternoon and did not deviate from the chicken dish and pizza and again enjoyed them both. Chef Bruno did come over again on our second visit and not only remembered us, but also remembered where we had sat on our first visit. Great customer service here. The chicken this time had the sausage in it and I am not to sure it needed it as is was great without it. The decor was nice a classy, loved the open kitchen.

They were obviously short staffed because several times during the 3 hours we were there no one was behind the bar.

The food came in an adequate amount of time and we were both very disappointed.  I had the \\"glazed\\" salmon entree.  My friend had the wine salad with salmon added.  Both of our pieces of salmon were very overdone causing them to be dry.  Mine had some type of gel sauce which looked like it had just been spread over the top.  Hers had nothing.  Seasonings were non existent.  The snap peas on my plate were sparse and very stringy.  I had to cut off the ends before eating them as they had not been properly prepared.

Even though it was dark, I loved the area this restaurant is in. Very \\"small townish\\" and the building itself is modern industrial. About 30 minutes north on I-4 from the Disney World area.\\n\\nWhat can I say about this place. After my five day vacation in Orlando, this meal, which was on the very first night we were in town, still stands out like a blinding star in my mind and taste buds. We got a plethora of food here so we could try as much as we could. 9 dishes between 3 people... and all was devoured.\\n\\n- Gruyere Biscuits: Like Red Lobster's biscuits but 10x better.\\n\\n- Mussels & Fries: My friend said this was his favorite dish of the night. I liked it, but the sauce was a little too thick for me. I really love my mussels in a light, white wine sauce, but if you don't mind something a little more heavier... go for it. Also comes with truffle fries to dip in the sauce.\\n\\n- Lobster Tacos: Lived up to the expectations as set by fellow yelpers.\\n\\n- Gatherer Salad: Perfect combo of ingredients and dressing. I'm going to crave this.\\n\\n- Spring Tonic Soup: The crab fritter in this was amazing. It's a thick broth, like a bisque, but the taste was so light. \\n\\n- Foie Gras Pastrami: The strawberry relish was a delightful surprise. I wasn't sure what to expect... fruit and foie gras, really? oh yes. \\n\\n - Suckling Pig & Scallops: I'm a big fan of having a \\"full bite\\" as my first taste - meaning I will put every single element that's on the plate onto my spoon and eat everything at once. I love to see what the chef is imagining when they put a complete dish together and how all the ingredients mix. When I did that for this dish, I literally had to put down my spoon, sit back in my chair, and just REVEL in the flavors. The suckling pig was so moist and juicy and mixed with the scallops, lima beans, etc... omg, so amazing. this was my favorite thing of the night.\\n\\n- Ramp Tortellini: Good flavors, tortellini was made well.\\n\\n- Potato Gnocchi: For me, the texture of the gnocchi was a little off, but my bf who loves gnocchi really liked this. \\n\\n- The Ravenous Pig Old Fashioned cocktail: OKAY, BACON BOURBON? That in itself sounds awesome. The guys liked this, but it was a little too strong for me.\\n\\n- D'Artagnan cocktail: I really liked this - light, yummy and fresh squeezed fruit.\\n\\nThe only non-positive (but not necessarily negative) thing I have to say was that the Tortellini, Gnocchi and Suckling Pig all had similar, if not the same, sauces. Although it was so very good, having one right after another was a little repetitive. \\n\\nThe service was great (including a waiter who had the most awesome handle-bar mustache ever), the experience was incredibly enjoyable.
