The cool cups, for even really little kids, with the straw as the handle, which allows them to drink easily as long as they are remotely familiar with using a cup; the kids plastic wear that is high quality, as well as incredibly cute. As a parent, I REALLY appreciate them thinking of the kids so much. And in thinking of the kids, they are thinking of the parents. This stuff makes taking kids to a place easier. The play area, though filled with older toys, the kids love it. And they have a great time every time we go there. The food though. THE FOOD. I am a vegan, and they've got really good options for us.

Plus, it has the word \\"jerk\\" in it, so I let my 14 year old loose and made all sorts of puns that would probably be more suitable to a Beavis and Butthead episode. \\n\\nBad idea.\\n\\nI got the dinner arrival shortly, and she (my girlfriend) inquisitively took a taste of it. \\"That's pretty spicy, even for me.\\"\\n\\nMy reply was, \\"Eh, it's pretty good.\\" \\n\\nShe knew I was lying. In between mouthfuls of potato salad, which I normally would never eat, to cool my burning mouth, esophagus, and stomach, I chomped down on that burger-like object with the goal of eating every bite, to the last crumb for some semblance of victory, even though it was quite clear I was struggling harder than Milli Vanilli's fabled MTV concert. I struggled, I gasped, and finally my plate was clear. It was glorious. I had done it! The impression was made and no one was the wiser around me! This afterglow was to be short lived.\\n\\nThe next morning after a brunch was, how can I say, not pleasant to a comical proportion. I always laughed and went \\"That will never happen to me!\\" but it did, Redbones' Jamaican Jerk Beef absolutely put a ruin on my digestive system. Like I said earlier, my fault for not being able to handle it.\\n\\nWisely, the last time I went was at around 12:00 after running around town and a concert, I got the steak and cheese. And without a doubt, it was one of the best steak and cheeses I've ever had. Onions, TONS OF CHEESE, good steak, and optional items like tomatoes, lettuce, and a big fat pickle beside it. Add in a Spiked Arnold Palmer and a Dark & Stormy, and all I could do was really rip and tear through the cow flesh like the raptor scene in Jurassic Park. On top of it all it was all cheap! Cheap cheap cheap!\\n\\nService has always been great, and they have Hitachino Nest beer, which makes Redbones my little heart's love.\\n\\nThis review has been a test of the pop culture reference guide.

But we decided to go back to Match with Ligaya to chat and check the place out.  \\n\\nFirst, the cocktails.  I should preface by saying that I'm a horrible booze snob.  Virtually all bars I've ever been to don't know how to make drinks properly.  That said, Match certainly did their darnedest.  I ordered a Manhattan with Rye and two dashes of bitters; they at least got the Rye and the bitters part right.  However, like many bars they treat the vermouth in a Manhattan the say way you would in a Dry Martini - just a splash to coat the inside of the glass and add aroma.  In a Manhattan, you really need a good ounce or so of sweet vermouth.  This being a common mistake, though, I let it slide.  It was an otherwise good drink (though perhaps a little watery from sitting in a shaker with ice for a few minutes.)\\n\\nNext, the food.  This is where Match really shines - we all ordered pizzas off the appetizer menu.  Delicious.  I'm a vegetarian, so I can't comment about the quality of their meat-based dishes, but the \\"Exotic Mushroom\\" pizza was superb (although not very exotic.)  We also ordered a spinach salad with goat cheese, which was quite tasty.  Considering the quality, the prices are fairly reasonable too.\\n\\nFinally, the atmosphere.  We all agreed it was pretty nice.  Mood lighting, swanky design, and half-circle booths (great, as Nicole pointed out, for snuggling up to that special someone on a date.)  It was also, however, quite loud, due not only to the music but also the the acoustics of the space, which cause people's voices to bounce around the room.  Not a huge deal, but expect to project your voice and lean in to talk.\\n\\nAll in all, a great restaurant experience.  4/5 because of the cocktail and the noise.

So, I said I didnt want it. She offered a refund and also offered me a regular pizza, but, I told her I couldnt eat regular crust. They were nice about it. They were professional. Glad they told me. Next time I go to a new pizza place I will ask them about their GF crust, I shouldnt assume, but, they should have it clearly stated on their menu if they are going to be called \\"vegan friendly\\" Both crusts should be vegan.

Upon arrival we were asked what our seating preference was and we said a booth. We had never been there before and assumed there was booths. We were indeed sat at  a booth, however it was directly next to the swinging kitchen door which was a little distracting. The server Chris did a fine job of recommending the Moscow mule cocktail and I enjoyed it and the next one as well. For app we shared a crab cake which was pretty good, but had a little too much breading for my liking. We had ordered a salad that came with our entrees and were served it prior to the crab cake app. My guess was either we looked hungry or perhaps all of the reviews commenting on slow kitchen cook times it was a necessary distraction. Either way the salad was fresh, but the salad dressing was not made in house. When the entrees arrived my lamb was cooked to a perfect med rare that I had requested, but my wife's salmon was dreadfully WAY past the meduim that was also requested. Apparently the kitchen didn't time the two dished to come out at the same time and the salmon had been prepared too early and sat and over cooked. Also they were perhaps miffed a bit on the sub for potatoes for the risotto that my wife ordered since they were just left over baked potatoes cut up and deep fried to a sad looking dark brow color. But again on a positive note my mustard enhanced potato salad that came with the lamb was delicious as was the    accompanying zucchini.

I ordered the Duck confit with pickled radishes, asparagus and potato. Wish the duck was served in a warm broth to add more moisture to the dish, but all in all the dish was deeelicious. I was converted to a radish fan. My dining partner ordered the famous Le Pigeon burger. He said the flavors were there, but oddly only the second half of the burger patty was too salty.

OK- no problemo.  - gave the digits for a call back when the table was ready. \\n\\nHungry took over so we headed over to a side street pizza joint for a snack.

Still elbows to elbows, but the thought of the cute guy sitting diagonally right across from me while I wolf down oysters was not going to be pleasant.  I recommend sitting at the bar instead. \\n\\nWe got 1 1/2 doz of oysters and 1/2 doz. of cherrystones,  hamachi tartare and the roasted wild sea bass.. all to share. \\n\\nThe oysters and cherrystones were very fresh, but I have to say, they were small.  I've had bigger.  The hamachi tartare had nice presentation, but was unfortunately overly tart with citrus flavor.  The people next to us saw what we were picking at and also ordered it.  Too bad they didn't ask us how it was. They took a few bites and had the barista take it away and ordered a salad instead. No joke. \\nThe bass entree was very tasty,  except for the pancetta that the fish was sitting ontop of- it was way too hard.\\n\\nI''m not a fan, but if I feel like spluging and waiting around, I would like to come back again and try their lobster roll."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Late night midnight snacks:\\nSeared Foie gras - pretty good\\nBone marrow - really tasty\\nOyster mushrooms - delicious\\nDouble Brie burger - yumm"},{"name":"Fire of Brazil","address":"218 Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"This place is a terrible representation of what real Brazilian food is like...\\nWe visited Fire of Brazil on May 28th and were first taken away by the overwhelming smell in the restaurant like a wet dirty dog...

The chicken was real tender and real juicy.  \\n\\nThe star of the show was the adobado, though.   I've never had it before so it might be really bad adobado and I don't know it, but what I had was crazy good.  It had a real nice spice to it, all around really flavorful.  Some people would probably find it too greasy, but I thought it was perfect.  \\n\\nOther notes:  The tacos were served with a nice, spicy sauce.  The tortilla chips were a little disappointing -- they tasted kind of stale, honestly.  At just under $2/taco La Casita isn't the cheapest place to grab a taco, either.  \\n\\nIn general, I'd recommend (and will probably go back to) La Casita for the adobado and chicken tacos.

If anything, I think they should offer both hash browns and house potatoes to accommodate both types of customers rather than make only one type of customer a priority. 2. The super scriddle was not nearly as satisfying as it sounds. The egg is baked into the pancake, which makes the pancake very dry and the egg almost completely unnoticeable.

We then moved on to the fried clams. The fried clams were plenty and melted in your mouth. The seafood brodetto/cioppino that was my main course was full blown heaven in a bowl. Crispy fish skin, just enough heat, whole prawns, yup it kicked ass. \\n    The most surprising part about the whole experience was the attitude at the restaurant. I was expecting pretentious entitlement that is inevitable when the wait out the door is never shorter than an hour. This is not what I saw. The dining room is intimate. The server was friendly. The food was unbelievable. This is success.

After growing up in Central New York, where Wegmans' roam free, it was tough being away from that when I moved to Boston. Now that they're open in Burlington, we make an excuse to go as frequently as possible. The staff is all nice and helpful, they have just about everything you could possibly want and the Wegmans brand food is, in some cases, better than the name brand product. What can I say, I love Wegmans. Also, their alcohol prices are generally cheaper than a lot of other package stores in the area which is a big bonus in my book. If you have never been to Wegmans you should go.

The outside of the deep fried egg was a little soggy, not crispy, but that could be because we waited a while to eat it, so that might have been our fault. Once you break through the soggy exterior of the egg, it was runny on the inside, which was a nice sauce over the asparagus, but I felt like the veggies already had enough flavor. Good dish, odd pairing. \\n2) Chicken Fried Trout: Really good! Super tasty! IT heavily deep fried like you would expect with the name \\"chicken fried\\". I liked how although it was heavily deep fried, it didn't appear oily. IT came with really nice lettuce to wrap the fish meat, which was a great pairing! \\n3) Glazed Pork Shoulder: SUPER tender! Really tasty! Just wish it came in a bigger portion. A good portion of it turned out to be fat, so that was a shame. \\n4) Bone marrow: comes with a pita bread, so you can scoop out the bone marrow and spread it on the pita bread to eat it like a pizza. I liked that idea, it's different from how other places serve bone marrow. Super tasty!\\n\\nService: \\nOur waitress was nice, friendly and fast. No complaints. \\n\\nAmbiance: \\nIt's a quaint little restaurant that had extravagant gold and high ceilings to accommodate the second floor that is pushed back further in the restaurant. The front door is SUPER heavy, so it's hard to get inside. It's a little cramped once you get past the heavy door and go inside, even the tables are all seated closely together. There's a candle on each table to set up a romantic ambiance. IT's more quiet, which makes it even easier to eavesdrop on your neighboring tables since they are so close. Haha.\\n\\nPrice: \\nBe prepared to put a dent into your wallet. When you walk out of here, your wallet is going to feel a lot lighter. Well, that's generally expected with French food, this place isn't a lot worse than other French places, but it's no cheap meal. \\n\\nOverall:\\nI enjoyed the food here and the dining experience but the wow factor wasn't really there for me. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted excellent and the experience was great, but it's probably just not my cup of tea.

He barely acknowledged us and had other servers come to our table. He didn't even bother giving us looks either. Okay, I am sorry if I did anything wrong here. I was just trying to enjoy my date with my boyfriend. I still remember this as if it was yesterday. NO customer should be feeling so unwelcomed. I couldn't even enjoy my meal properly because I was so bothered by his rude presence. This is totally unacceptable. And the fact that I am writing a paragraph just about this particular waiter is a problem itself. \\n\\nOn to the food - I was really disappointed with the dark malted chocolate waffle this time around. The creme fraiche was not fresh at all - it was frozen. When I tried spreading it on the waffle, it just turned into water due to the ice that was in it. It just didn't sing together like it did the first time I ordered this. The maple bourbon donuts definitely upgraded. It was so pillowy and had the perfect balance of all the flavors.

We were pleasantly greeted and proceeded to order the Indian and Mexican schnitzel on a baguette.  Once the ordered was ready, it was visually appealing, but unfortunately, looks can be deceiving.  When you have a sandwich with sauce, you need a certain kind of bread to soak up the flavors without getting soggy. I think if the chicken was seasoned and marinated to distinguish the different flavors before frying; the taste would be better than throwing a flavored seasoning on it after it is cooked.  I did not care for the Indian schnitzel, but the Mexican schnitzel was decent.  The fries were good.  I don't care to eat at an establishment when I think I could have made this so much better at home and this was the case with Seven Hens.

I knew they opened at 11:30 am, so I made sure we zipped on over after touring the Paul Revere House in North End (they are very close to one another, just a few streets over). We arrived outside the restaurant at about 10:50 am or so, and we were NOT the first ones in line. So it's not so crazy that you have to show up an hour before or anything, but I would recommend coming by 30-40 minutes before opening to ensure you get a seat as soon as it opens, because Neptune has very limited seating.\\n\\nThey actually opened the doors past 11:30, which was slightly annoying, but oh well. We were seated, drink orders were taken quickly, and we set to ordering our lunch. You can order oysters via a paper menu similar to the ones you see at sushi restaurants. The oyster menus containing a description of every oyster they have, so you just list the number of oysters you'd like by each one on the list. I can't even remember what we ordered exactly, but we ordered two each of six different varieties to create a dozen. I do remember they were all East Coast oysters, of course. They had a couple of West Coast varieties (one of them being the delicious kumamoto) but seeing as we were in Boston, we stuck with East. I remember not liking only one out of the bunch, because I just found it too briny.\\n\\nWe also shared a bowl of the clam chowder. Ehh, not too memorable. It was quite thin and I like my chowder thicker.\\n\\nFor entrees, we shared the Seared Georges Bank Scallops and the Maine Lobster Roll (hot). Food came out relatively quickly considering how packed the place was. Guess it helps to have a specially curated, but small menu. Most people tend to order the lobster roll, anyway. The lobster roll was not too heavy on the butter, which I liked. It allowed me to taste the lobster meat better. Fries were super tasty, nicely crisped, not too potato-ey. I also really enjoyed the scallops. The duck confit added an interesting element to the flavor that I had never experienced before. The scallops were served with the tiniest Brussels sprouts I had ever seen. They were like the size of the tip of my finger (OK, not a helpful comparison, but TINY.

What a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nWe came to the Liberty Hotel on a Saturday night because we heard that the Alibi Bar was a lot of fun (it is).  The Alibi Bar menu, which draws on the Scampo kitchen, is limited, but good so when we got hungry we decided to head over to the source for a late dinner.\\n\\nWhere to begin? Trendy, upscale, outstanding service and a well -thought-out menu.  It's up there with Scarpetta in Miami Beach and Ai Firori in mid-town Manhattan (actually, its better than Ai Fiori). \\n\\nFor starters I had the Jasper's Blonde Oysters and Chipolata Sausages.  O love oysters and the sausage was a nice touch; it's not spicy yet flavorful.  My wife ordered the eggplant side as a starter; I'm not a fan of eggplant, but it was incredibly flavorful and delicious.\\n\\nFor entrees my wife ordered the spaghetti bolonese while I had a more exotic choice - spaghetti with crackings (pork crisps) and hot pepper.  Both were outstanding.\\n\\nFor wine there are several by the glass options.  We opted for the California Cabernet and were not disappointed.\\n\\nDelicious double espressos rounded out the meal.\\n\\nScampo boldly proclaims its being named as one of the top 20 Italian restaurants in America for good reason ... it is.

I was running late, so I decided to take a cab instead of the train from the BU area that cost me about $20.  When I arrived tonight, I learned the whole restaurant was closed for a special private event.  I asked to see the manager.  I told him my dilemma about someone taking down my reservation earlier that week and at the time, it wasn't a problem.  I even said that he could check the reservation log and see that there is a reservation there.  The fact is that I wasn't contacted to let me know that the restaurant was closed that evening. I wouldn't have had to worry about being late, and I would've saved myself $20 tonight.  The other problem was that the manager didn't even apologize. He said to me, \\"I can get you into Umbria tonight.\\" I told him, \\"No thanks! I'm good! Bye!\\" \\n\\nI will not visit this restaurant again.

With a lot of new places in Boston popping out serving crudo, Bar Mezzana's definitely stand out of the pack. \\n\\nThe Prosciutto was also excellent, and the house made mozarella was creamy and yum yum! BF really enjoyed his Beef Tartare and two Pasta dishes that we picked (Orechiette and Tagliolini) were great as well. \\n\\nMy only complaint was the acoustics of the restaurant - even though we were seated in a private section, the noise level was still considerably loud to engage a conversation.

This is some pretty delicious stuff right here.\\n\\nFIRST - on Getting here: \\nOn a stomp-about-around-town this weekend (1/21), we found ourselves making a pit stop at the Krog Street Market just at the perfect time for lunch.   Keep that in mind:  Krog Street Market is *always* a zoo on warm weather weekends.   Bring your patience.   We walked in, but there is a lot for parking on the west side of Krog St. -- again, bring your patience if you plan to drive.  With the Eastside Beltline literally right here, you'll be dealing with a lot of walkers, bikers and skateboarders.  I highly suggest those routes of transportation if you can.   (If not?  Definitely approach off Krog Street instead of Irwin to avoid the foot traffic.)  \\n\\nWhen you get inside, you'll find GC BBQ is in the far back southeast corner of the market.   (same side as Hop City, just keep walking down to the back.)\\n\\nNOW the important stuff -  the FOOD:\\nI got the pulled pork sandwich and my friend got the brisket.  Both were absolutely delicious.  They cut the meat right in front of you, place it between two fluffy thick fresh white pieces of bread and wrap it up with a pickle spear.  On check out, they'll ask what type of sauce you want - the regular or sweet - and you get little containers so you put on as much or as little as you want yourself.  Here's the thing: the sweet is actually a little more tangy/spicier than the regular!  I found a mixture of both together is quite nice.  Oh, the pork was so juicy and tender and I found myself agreeing with my friend: this IS one of the best BBQ places in Atlanta.  I haven't had a sandwich this delicious in quite some time.\\n\\nWe shared a side of macaroni and cheese as well; with the size of the sandwich, a small share was enough, especially because this mac and cheese was really rich and creamy and delicious.  They use rigatoni noodles, which are fabulously big platforms for the glorious, glorious cheese goo.\\n\\nThe one downside?   It is a bit pricey.  $8 for the sandwich (ok, and a pickle spear) but everything else is ala carte:  no sides come with your purchase here.  So two sandwiches, one small side and a bottle of Sprite came to $25.  I think this may only be at this Krog Street Market location though as their website shows sandwich plates coming with 2 sides.  So this might be an indication of the location more than anything else.  \\n\\nIf you like BBQ, do yourself a favor and give GC a try.   I know I'll be going back again: already eyeing up the smoked chicken and the homemade pimento cheese for next time!"},{"name":"The Soup Peddler Real Food & Juice Bar","address":"501 W Mary St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is awesome!

We were headed somewhere together, and I asked her to accompany me as I \\"ran some errands.\\" This, hardly an errand at all, happened to be one of my stops along the journey. My friend had a few samples, and she really enjoyed them. She even asked if they sold cookbooks, because of how much she enjoyed their samples. \\n\\nI am not usually a big fan of gluten-free treats, because they taste gluten-free. The only gluten-free pastry that I ever enjoyed was the short-lived Starbucks Valencia Orange cake (you fad-dieters missed out). Besides, they're loaded with unnatural ingredients and more sugar than any human should consume in a single sitting. \\n\\nI bought the almond chocolate cake (dairy free too!!) and it was very, very good. Full disclosure: I hate chocolate in pastries. I never enjoyed chocolate cupcakes, chocolate cake, chocolate chip cookies. Although I didn't love the cake, I enjoyed the sample enough to buy a full slice, which I ate quickly. It was delicious. I also had a sample of a delicious cupcake: vanilla with vanilla (?) frosting. It was pretty good. I know I limit my palate by not eating chocolate, but I have a right to *some* level of choice, even with food allergies and intolerances.  The non-chocolatey options were very good. My gluten-full friend had a sample of something with homemade nutella, and she absolutely loved it. \\n\\nSo, obviously, there are a lot of sugary treats here, but it's not Violette's Natural Foods Store; it's Violette's Gluten Free Bakery. I'm impressed by their ability to find their niche market and their ability to find such an appropriate location for a gluten-free bakery. I don't know how profitable it is, but I'm willing to bet they went into the business thinking about the desperate need for a space like this one. \\n\\nIt was the least anxiety-provoking experience re: food that I have had in the last 8 or so years. I'm sure gluten-full foods taste different, but I'm not looking to replicate something I know I can't have. I'm looking to be a celiac who gets to be happy eating, no matter where she goes. \\n\\nOf course it opened up in Cambridge first.... OF COURSE; I expect nothing less from the crunchy-granola-bar people I happen to call neighbors. I bet all the fad dieters are happy, too.

The lemon pepper had a something tangy and bitter flavor which I did not care for, but others may like. In regards to the agave sriracha flavor there was definitely a sweet and spicy tang which We liked. The orders come with fries either regular Krinkle cut or sweet potato. During this particular night the sweet potato was not available and thus we cannot not provide an opinion. The regular were seasoned with a seasoned salt and was the best part of the meal. Each fry left you wanting more and I'm not sure if it was the flavor or the salt. Probably a bit of both.

For my taste the sauce had too much mayo and not enough ume.  It is a good concept in theory but not terribly well done.  \\n\\n- the gomaae which had WAAAAY too much sesame.

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner to celebrate our 2 year anniversary (yes I know, how cute right?) this month and we were both very much satisfied with both our meals. I got the 7.5 oz. Petite Filet Mignon and he got the 10 oz. Filet Mignon both included mashed potatoes with this to-die-for gravy and vegetables. But the best part had to have been the lemon basil butter with Maine lobster topped on both of our steaks! Delicious!  We both had drinks too but honestly, I don't remember what I had because I was so fixated on my steak! I think I might have had a Mai Tai. The cost of the dinner was around $170 including tip but it was worth it for what we both had and for the special occasion we were celebrating! \\n\\nHappy hour is a wonderful treat too with the yummy calamari, spicy fries (that's my favorite!), and the burger along with a long list of cheap eats.  But beware, since this place is a popular destination for tourists, those celebrating special occasions, and happy hour enthusiasts, the place gets crowded at its peak times, which is usually, all the time. The best part about this place is of course, the view of downtown Portland from the 30th floor of the Bankcorp building. If you can, try and get there as early as possible to try and snag a window seat so that you're able to enjoy the downtown view.

My husband and I decided to check it out tonight...got there at about 6:30pm on Saturday. There was a table open, and we quickly grabbed it while we perused the menu. We ordered sandwich #2(white bean, smoked paprika pesto, and lettuce on baguette), salad #2(greens, peas, asaparagus, feta, and jamon serrano), and the meat plate. My husband got a beer, and I got a glass of rose.\\n\\nI didn't really enjoy the atmosphere-it's fine, but a little sterile-it definitely needs some warming up. There also seems to be a lot of space and a lack of tables...\\n\\nAnyway, back to the food and drink. Drinks came out promptly. The keg was blown on the beer my husband got, so he got 2/3 beer supposedly for free(I'll explain that later). My rose was delicious. As was the meat plate-salami from long island, coppa, and sopressata from olympic provisions. All good, and loved the pickle garnish (I wish there were more)\\n\\nThey mixed up our order and brought two of the same salad, one with ham, one without. We cleared that up pretty quickly, and our sandwich came out soon. A little bready, but I liked the idea of it. The flavors could have been more pronounced.\\n\\nFor dessert, two Xocatl de David truffles and two caramels. They were really tasty.\\n\\nSo, really, the food they were serving was tasty and made of high quality ingredients, but I guess the atmosphere and service(or lack thereof) was really disappointing. I believe they also charged us for the beer that was supposedly free...it was unclear as they didn't itemize the bill. \\n\\nThey do have a good cheese and specialty food selection, so maybe I would go back for that or to get a sandwich to go."},{"name":"American Craft","address":"1700 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"What a disappointing meal.

I live in Los Angeles, and was visiting my brother who now lives in Austin.  He is a magician, and ended up talking to a group of people who were waiting for a table as he came back from the bathroom.  He told them he was a magician, and because they were there celebrating one of their birthdays, he decided to do a trick for them.  They were all seated at their table (about 6 African American friends in their 30's) while he performed a few tricks for them.  They were not loud, they were not overly excited, they simply exclaimed a few times in amazement, laughed, and commented on how blown away they were by the trick (the typical reaction to great magic tricks).  The restaurant was crowded and loud as it was, and we barely heard this group of people reacting to the trick.  Next thing we know, there's commotion at the table.  A staff member approached the friends, and told them they were being loud and disruptive, and that they needed to control themselves.  My brother was bewildered by this, because they were clearly not being disruptive.  Justifiably so, this group was offended, and defended themselves by disputing the claim that they were being disruptive.  Before we knew it, they were being kicked out of the restaurant.  They obliged, but were clearly upset.  Before they left, they adamantly asked to speak to the manager- Something that any upset customer should be entitled to.  However the Magnolia staff deemed this as also inappropriate behavior, and threatened to call the police if they didn't leave.  When they stated again that they wanted to speak to a manager about the way they were treated, the staff member got on the phone and called the police.  As they began to leave, when they passed by our table, my brother apologized to them for any part he played in causing the problem, and wished the birthday girl a happy birthday.  Rightfully upset, she began to vent to us about the way they were treated, explaining that she felt they were being discriminated against because they were black (and they were the only black customers in the restaurant, I might add.)  We were listening and agreeing with her, and sympathizing with the situation, which we all felt was unjustified on the part of the staff.  At the point, a Magnolia staff member came over and told her to leave, saying that she was \\"disturbing these people at the table.\\"   We immediately corrected him, and told him that we were having a conversation with her, we thought what had happened was wrong, and that she was in no way disturbing us.  At that point, the entire group of friends left, very upset.  \\n\\nWe were all extremely disturbed by what we witnessed tonight.  This was my first time in Texas, and I don't know if this is a Texas thing or just a Magnolia thing, but either way it was unacceptable.  I was horrified.  I don't think I could ever bring myself to ever again patronize a business that treats their African American clientele differently than any other person.  I hate to say it, but I doubt my friends and I (all White) would have received the same treatment if we were laughing a little too loudly, defended ourselves, and asked to speak to a manager. \\n\\nThis was a very troubling experience at Magnolia."},{"name":"SuperChefs Breakfast & More","address":"199 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!

So good that, I didn't even like lobster before I had the lobster roll, now I find myself fantasizing about the next occasion that I can spring $25 for something so good I feel guilty after every bite.  Although a little less glam in comparison to the lobster roll, the Neptune Burger was a pleasant surprise for a seafood joint.

Also, I'd previously noticed how busy Manuel's was during Saturday morning brunch-time and had made a mental note to eat here at some point.\\n\\nOverall we had a good experience. Although this place doesn't serve up the best Tex-Mex in Austin, the food was pretty good.  We started with nice bowl of fresh guacamole and corn chips.  My husband and I both had chicken enchiladas for dinner - with verde and suiza salsa respectively.  I found the Verde a little too mild; bring on the chilli!  \\n\\nThere were far more interesting appetisers and entrees on the menu.  I was tempted by the tuna ceviche and the battered wild-caught bay scallops.  But I've been away from Texas for over 5 weeks, and I was craving Tex-Mex comfort food. Good ole enchiladas. \\n\\nSure prices are a little higher than other Tex-Mex restaurants, but Manuel's is a little more up-market than the competition.  And I assume you are paying more here for the location - rent can't be cheap on Congress. \\n\\nThe decor was nice - low lighting, wooden floors, leather booths, and jazz playing in the background.

I only go to it when I'm really hungry and I'm near it but, after recent experiences I'm done and would rather just go to McDonalds right beside them (even though I hate McDonalds, they seem to be better than this Tim's in a pinch).\\n\\nOne time their debit machine was not working.  I went though the drive through and ordered a bagel, just one single bagel a $2 order.  They had no signage anywhere near the drive through that they could not accept debit.  They also did not inform me prior to ordering.  So I waited in line and eventually got to the window where they told me their debit machine was not working.  I told them debit was all I had and they really should have some signage up.  I told them I didn't have a way to pay, debit was my payment and I wouldn't have come through the drive thru if they had just put up signage like their supposed to.  I could see my bagel sitting there, ready to be handed off but, because THEIR DEBIT MACHINE WAS NOT WORKING and THEY DIDN'T PUT UP ANY SIGNAGE, I couldn't pay.  So what does this woman do?  She takes the bagel and instead of just giving it to me as the it's not my fault the debit machine is broken, and they didn't have any signage up informing me, and THROWS IT IN THE GARBAGE.  Like there's children starving in the world and you just threw out a perfectly good bagel... wtf?!  I drove away empty handed and hungry because, of a situation that was THEIR FAULT and wasted my time while my still hot, perfectly good bagel sat in the trash can.\\n\\nBut, it gets worse folks.\\n\\nThe other day I did go there around 7-8 at night on a cool night, and ordered an iced-coffee.  They were all of iced coffee, ok no big deal, I order an iced capp, their machine is broken, ok slightly annoyed but, whatever I order a hot chocolate, their machine is being cleaned, so I finally just settle and order a plain coffee, BUT NOPE THATS RIGHT YOU GUESSED IT FOLKS, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT EITHER.  It was currently being brewed.\\n\\nSo I decided to get a bagel.  I order four-cheese bagel, \\"sorry we are all out of four cheese\\", ok no big deal I order a twelve grain bagel \\"sorry no 12 grain\\", now I'm really annoyed and order a plain bagel, finally they have that.  So that's all I get.  When I pull away from the window and open it up, the burnt to the point it's actually black.  The entire thing was rock hard, cold and black.  Which is actually a health hazard because, when Bread burns it produces a type of toxic chemical which is why you shouldn't eat extremely burnt bread products.  It wasn't even edible, no part of it could be salvaged.  I go back in a request a new one.  \\"Sorry ma'am that was the last one.\\"  So I order a grilled cheese, and after ALL THIS THEY STILL MAKE ME PAY THE $3 DIFFERENCE.  Really?!  So I just pay it because, I'm getting super hungry.  What do they hand me?  I piece of UNMELTED cheese, in between two pieces of cold bread.  I asked them to please grill it so the cheese melts.  The guy looks at me and says \\"the cheese will never melt\\".\\n\\n...\\n\\n\\nIT'S CHEESE IT MELTS OMG IDIOTS!  I asked for a refund, left and never looked back.

We ordered the Poke. It took FOREVER. The place was empty almost except for us. Poke is raw fish which doesn't seem like it ought to take long to dice and put on a plate, but it was at least 30 minutes. The folks next to us also waited quite a long time for their food. Besides the four of us at the bar, there was maybe two other tables in the whole place. Once we received the poke, the portion was very small. We had thought about getting something else, but we needed to be to work by Monday and couldn't imagine how long cooked food would take if raw food took this long.\\n\\nTo sum up: The beer was good to really good (even with the weird thing with the AB).

I ordered the pulled pork plate with mac n cheese and collard greens.\\n\\nWhile we waited, our server had brought out some cornbread with butter that was really good. The room was packed but the food came out pretty quickly. The portion was very generous. Mac n cheese was absolutely delicious; creamy and cheesy - you could eat a bowl of just that and be very happy! The collard greens were just okay, needed a little seasoning. The server had also brought a side of baked beans by mistake which were really good, much better than the collards.

The difference is JJ's is locally owned, tastier, friendlier, and has a more interesting set of ingredients from which to choose.\\n\\nWhile I have replicated my favorite Chipotle burrito at JJ's- with fine results- I typically prefer to make the Mediterranean version of that same burrito: chicken, lentils instead of beans, tabbouleh, \\"cucumber/dill\\" sauce (essentially tzatziki) instead of salsa, and veggies and feta. It's also an excellent concoction as a bowl or flatbread.\\n\\nWorth special mention is JJ's tabbouleh. I've never cared for tabbouleh but for some reason JJ's is delicious to me and I never skip it.

My most recent visit would bring it down to a 3.5 and I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and roudn it up to a 4.\\n\\nIn my previous visits I usually got the leopold or their red sauce and they never dissapointed. The noodles are cooked to my liking of al dente and the sauce is very flavorful. The pasta came with a slice of their toasted bread, perfect to sop up the sauce with. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 was that I always left feeling a little hungry, I think dor the price, maybe they could do a slightly larger portion or just throw in some onions or peppers..something to make it a little more substantial (a personal preference)\\n\\nGoing back to my most recent visit, I got their at 6pm on saturday and they were sold out of the soup, zucchini noodles and almost oout of noodles and the line was ridiculously long. SO GET  THERE EARLY ON THE WEEKEND!! This didn't affect me too much because I stick to pastas and thankfully, they weren't out of sauce or noodles. While I was waiting in line, the servers were walking around helping people decide what to order and and answering any questions people had. I appreciated this very much because it helped the line go by much quicker and I'm a very indecisive orderer so this was great. I decided to go with pasta/salad combo and I was informed that you could pair any of the salads with any of the pastas. Also, they suggested I try the diavolo as I am a fan of spicy food. II was sold, except when I ordered there was an upcharge for getting the beet salad, which no one infromed me of. OTHER THAN HOUSE SALAD, there will be an UPCHARGE. The foo was tasty but the diavolo was way too oily and could have used a little more lemon flavor and had way tooo much cheese! The beet salad was good but once again maybe could have used some acid or something to spruce it up. Also, the portion of the combo is not as filling as the full order of pasta. Next time I go, I'll stick to my full order of leopold but hey, I tried something new."},{"name":"Slapfish","address":"783 N Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food!

What - that's only 3 stars in the Yelp system?  Never mind then...\\n\\nFirst, let me just say how PAINFUL it is to go to any given Restaurant Row establishment.  We went on a Tuesday, presumably after the worst of rush hour (19:00 reservation), and it still took 15-20 minutes from the time we exited (or tried to) to actually getting to the restaurant.  The way the lights are, I think, south-bound exit ramp folks get screwed.  I swear next time I'd go EAST, do a 'U' and come back and it'll be faster.  That's a shame, since there are many restaurants there I'd like to try or visit again, but I'm just loath to venture down there.\\n\\nEven though we had a reservation, and they weren't busy, there was still a bit of a wait before we were seated.  Ambiance was a mix of faux-elegance and \\"tourist-trap\\" look.  It's fine, really - we didn't come for the d√©cor.  Waiters did not exhibit an attitude toward MD - you say, \\"they'd better not\\", but I have occasionally seen it.  We were very happy to see the 2015 Pinot Gris on the wine list ($34).  This was Wine Enthusiast Best Buy Wine of the Year last year that retails for $13 - so, not an outrageous markup.  And while you could question whether it really is 91 points (I'd give it an 88 or 89), it was a good choice.  \\n\\nWe were served an amuse-bouche for no apparent reason, but we weren't going to argue: a sort of jumbo-sized version of bang-bang shrimp that was good.  We tucked into our oysters, fresh, but rather tasteless (I will find out why later).  Still, a sprinkle of salt, a squish of lemon and we're happy as a ...um, CLAM.  No mignonette was served with it, which sort of surprised me.  (No bread was served throughout the meal either - not cool).  My wife had the lobster for a main course, while I opted for the Mahi-mahi.  Both were good.  The ooey-gooey dessert was excellent.  Service was mixed to good.  We were tagged-team by 2 guys.  One was good (Scotty, I think?) - even poured my wine a couple of times!  Again, you say, \\"They'd better!\\", but I'm telling you, if I had a scientific tally, I swear I'd be one-up on all the wait staff combined, and it's not because I gulp it down at break-neck speed.\\n\\nAs we were leaving, I peered into the work station where they were shucking oysters.

Finding hand pulled noodles used to be damn near impossible in Portland, thankfully not so anymore! I got the chicken and hand pulled noodle stir fry dish (forgive me, I don't know the Chinese name). I got to watch them pull the noodle for my dish! They serve you such a large portion they don't even close the box. One of the best parts is the stir fried vegetables aren't some precut, frozen, afterthought that they throw in. You get beautifully caramelized mushrooms, carrots, green onions, and purple cabbage. The chicken in my dish was seared exceptionally well on the outside, clearly they have a blazing hot wok or flattop in the cart. The hand cut noodles were chewy, and super long. The cut was more consistent and thinner than comparable noodle places, like Frank's. If you're a wuss with spice like I am, make sure to get it mild. It still has a touch of spice. The sauce is primarily savory and salty, not a sweet yakisoba style sauce.  This place is delicious, and thus quite busy. Their is a sign outside politely asking that you do not make special requests during peak hours, make sure and respect that. They will update you on how long you'll be waiting, don't be surprised if it's 20 minutes. But this is freshly made, amazingly laborious food you're getting.

Alexander's Restaurant","address":"4701 Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I, until last night, have only had good experiences at J. Alexander's.  We live in New Jersey but we visit Atlanta frequently because we are planning our formal wedding here.  We generally like the restaurant so much that we're sure to drop in on every visit to the city.  Based on our most recent experience, however, I can only conclude that service is not their first priority and you might better served by another upscale restaurant (Season's 52 is a proximate alternative).\\n\\nWe were seated promptly at our 9:30 pm arrival and after my wife ordered a martini, the waitress told us about the entr√©e specials available for the evening.  They included a halibut and a blue-cheese crusted 8 oz filet mignon.  My wife and I each decided we wanted the specials - she, the filet and for me, the halibut.\\n\\nUpon hearing our order,  the waitress tells us to hold on while she checks with other waitstaff to determine whether the filet mignon special is still available.  She returns and, apparently, it is not.  What the restaurant can do, though, is sell us the 10 oz steak for $2 more and put the blue cheese crust on it.  That sounded outlandish to us so we asked to see the manager.  The manager came over and insisted on this increased pricing for the special,  stating with some eye-rolling, \\"Well, I can't cut it...\\" essentially saying she can't cut the 10 oz steak down to an 8 oz steak.  What a silly idea! No one requested cutting the 10oz steak down to 8 oz; the pricing was the issue. Was it our fault that they'd run out of the special yet continued to advertise it to customers?\\n\\nAt the higher-end restaurants we frequent, if the waitress tells you about the specials and it turns out a special is unavailable, the restaurant bites the bullet and offers what they have for the original price.  Instead, this manager was more willing to let patrons walk out the door, as we did, than to eat the $2 difference between the special 8 oz and the available 10 oz.\\n\\nThis may seem like minor needling but I believe it reflects a poor approach to customer service and I'd hold off on visiting this J. Alexander's for a while - at least until they've either had the time to educate this manager on how to properly deal with customers - or shown her the door.

Once at the front desk I was greeted by a young lady that was very pleasant but this is where the whole weekend went downhill.She never displayed to me my room rate nor did she ask or tell me did I want to use a different card for room incidentals. All I got was a room keys and a finger point around the corner where the elevators were. Let me say this I have 7 years in the hospitality industry and that a no, no! So I went to check the room and it was large and clean at least I thought. I went back down stairs to get my girlfriend and luggage. Once I was almost done unpacking a gentleman with an African accent pops out of nowhere and was very abrasive about not parking where I was at.  I told him that \\"I'm done now and that I'll just move the car.\\" He just repeated what he said and I was like okay but he did take my cart. I believe he saw my annoyed facial expression and was trying to make up for it. Any who we finally got to our room and my girlfriend was impressed at first until she saw that the shower was gross. Dirt and soap scum was all in the grout like water was thrown on and never scrubbed. (picture below) Lucky there was two showers in the room so that we could shower. As well as there was a lamp in the living area that wouldn't turn on but the bulb was still hot. What is a hazard so I unplugged it and proceed to call down stairs and ask for the General Manager.  It was stated to me that the General Manager wouldn't be in until the morning so I had to wait till then. We decided to leave the hotel and get something to eat but I was still bothered by the missed steps. So I decided to check my account and notice that it was charge $376.00 but my room rate with tax was $254.00 for the two nights. So I called the hotel while we were out to asked about my rate. A lady answered the phone and asked what I was being charged. She said $119.00 a night to which I said that's incorrect! It should $109.00 a night with a total of $254.00 for the two nights. I asked her what were the other charges in which she said incidentals. It was $50.00 a day for that plus the $20.00 that was over charge to me. What made me even more upset was I don't understand why the front desk agent never stated this too me so that I could have corrected then as well as put down another card for incidentals. Very frustrating to me because it could have been avoided when I checked in. So when morning arrived I called to the front desk and asked when will the General Manager be in and the guy stated at 11:00am. I said okay and stated that I would call back then. The night before we pre-ordered room service for breakfast the following morning before we went to sleep. The room service came on time and it seem like It was going to great day at the hotel. Then we notice that not all our items we ordered actually came. So once again I had to call down and get someone to bring us the rest of our items. I decided to come down and talk to the General around 11:00am which they told me that he already left for the day. He was there at 6am and left around 10am, which mean that a staff member lied to me. I stated that I needed to get the room rate change because it was incorrect. So they got me the Assistant Manager Michael. Once again I stated to him that my rate was wrong in which he stated that because I \\"extended my rate that it was the reason the rate went up.\\" Which pissed me off even more because that was not the case because I booked the room 3 WEEKS in advance for 2 nights through Trip Advisor, second you can see it on my Hyatt rewards and third I had the confirmation number of it. I really felt like my intelligence was being tested on something so simple as a rate change.  Through our time here it seems that we receive so, so, so treatment than other customers and I just didn't get it. Was it because we weren't having a wedding at the place or a baby shower? Did I have to throw money in the air to get the same service as others? I mean even the staff was rude at times, I just don't get it. So when I checked out I asked to speak with the General Manager again and once again he was not in. So I had to speak with Michael again (Oh Great) and explain to him my disappointment with the stay. He listens to my concerns like he was supposed to do and offered us bunch on the house. I accepted and thought maybe this could be a good note to the visited. Its wasn't, now the bunch at the restaurant was very impressive and the food was good. We sat down and once the server greeted us she asked what did we want to drink. We ordered water and mimosas in which she brought two glasses and one of them had a lipstick all over it. I told her no on that glass and did you see that? She said she was sorry, which seems like everyone was doing at the hotel the whole weekend. After that we asked for straws and never received them.

The prices are good, the drinks are good, the ambiance and service are welcoming.  Getting the food right is a quick fix.\\" \\n\\nI have to start my review off with a quote from another review. I couldn't agree more with the statement above. Starky's is a nice place for when you want to get away from the normal day to day trials of other gay establishments, but the outdated and heavy food is such a let down.\\n\\nI stumbled upon this place a few years ago when I first moved to Portland. I found myself here a couple nights a week, but these days the very mention of this place makes me just roll my eyes. The wait staff clumsily does the best job that they can do, which is forgivable. The food on the other hands is not forgivable, it's just out right terrible. I find myself going only because it's great quality time with friends and associates that don't know better.\\n\\nToday marked the last time that I will be wasting my money in Starky's. There were a couple things wrong with my service today, but screwing up my simple order was the nail in the coffin. I can overlook a lot of things if the food knocks me off my feet. I wanted to keep it simple this time around when ordering. I ordered a California burger from the menu and ended up receiving a plain burger. When I asked the waiter why I received the wrong burger he simply stated that they weren't making those burgers at this time. I think that that's something you discuss with the patron before making the call to change the order and bringing me what you assume is comparable. The plain burger was just OK. The top bun had been toasted, but still tasted stale and cold. The meat patty was mediocre (Salt and Pepper required). I also could have done with the side of fries due to my ever growing waistline and because they were cold. \\n\\nIt seems to be one thing after another when I visit Starky's, but the food is just terrible and there's no gaining my service back without possibly doing in overhaul to kitchen staff.\\n\\nAnd one last thing.

I am much more a cookie and cake person than a milkshake fan when it comes to dessert, but wow- the liquid nitrogen milkshakes at Blue, Inc. were amazing!  I really loved the root beer float milkshake- the marshmallows added a surprising chewiness that really made the drink a unique experience.  Blue, Inc. had a cozy yet urbane atmosphere, and I can't wait to return.  Trade also had a beautiful atmosphere and delicious food- also on my list for future outings.  The burger at Radius was so good that in addition to my portion, I snagged another unclaimed half- too full is not a feeling that I often encounter!  I would have to say that my favorite stop, however, was Miel at the InterContinental.  The honey pear tarte tatin with salted caramel ice cream is probably THE best dessert I have ever had, anywhere.  I grew up in the South, have lived in New Orleans, and eat dessert with the majority of meals, so I have had quite a bit of practice in assessing dessert, and this totally wowed me.  I will return.  This dessert alone merits a night out, and the setting at Miel provides a peaceful, elegant backdrop against which to simply relax and savor the experience.\\n\\nAudrey's enthusiasm is contagious and her knowledge is expansive.

The ornate carvings and detailed ceilings reminiscent of the glorious Golden Hind can only be found in two of my regular coastal home bases, the Biltmore in LA, and the Fairmont Copley. Outstanding decor.\\n\\nThe food is quite excellent, with probably 80% of the menu that is absolutely 5-Star (the bluefish toast, for example), with the rest that maybe try too hard. But very worthy.\\n\\nThe cocktails are exquisite, especially if you like your whiskies and bourbons. It's classic old world charm with just enough creative liberties to keep it current with today's palate.\\n\\nWhere the Oak Room falls short is service and general ambiance. Don't get me wrong, the service is courteous, but painfully boring, and feels like I'm in a library foyer. It's sleepy. If you've been to the Harvard Club in the Back Bay, this is maybe a notch below in excitement, but thankful without the snootiness.\\n\\nThe bar service is on point. But the rest of the lounge/restaurant feels..... geriatric. My server, probably in his 40s, forgot specific orders and instructions twice, and had the energy of a Valium addict.

It took me a while to notice it, but when I looked it over and saw that they delivered breakfast and Ben and Jerrys, who wouldn't get excited? No one in my house had tried it, so I had nothing to go off of there. Even though the outside definitely looked sketchy, a lot of buildings in Somerville are old and sketchy looking, and I've never really had a problem.\\n\\nThis place...there is definitely a problem, to say the least. I found myself getting a little hungry around 10:30 pm and I decided to grab the menu off the fridge, knowing that their hours are until 2 am. I decided to go the healthy option and get a greek salad with grilled shrimp - sounds delightful, right? I'm moving in a week and I figured now is as good a time as any to give this place a shot before I go. 9/10 times I will yelp a place before I order from it, but it's literally a 3 minute walk and I figured I didn't have much to lose, as I think it's actually kind of hard to find really bad food in Somerville since it's so \\"hip\\" and \\"upcoming\\".\\n\\nWhen I called, the service on the phone definitely wasn't the best, but I mean, I don't have extremely high expectations for service when it comes to pickup/delivery places. I had to repeat some things, but not a big deal. He forgot to ask whether I was paying cash or credit and called back to ask, which I thought was a little odd (don't you have the means to process both once I get there?), but again, not a big deal. He said that it would be about 20 minutes, again, totally expected.\\n\\nI grab my coat and head outside for the 3 minute walk. Place definitely still looks sketchy, but man, let me tell you, the inside is way sketchier than the outside. I walk in and the guy is standing with his back to the door, staring longingly at a computer screen. It takes him a second to notice me, and I didn't say anything because I didn't know if he was someone else picking something up or if he worked there. The place clearly was intended for use as an actual Italian restaurant, as there is a long bar which is currently only used for storage, and if you look around the corner there is a room that is clearly supposed to be a dining room. The place is silent, so I assume this dude is the only person who works there. Cook, driver, and phone person all in one! I said that I ordered a salad, and he hands it to me, and again asks whether it was cash or card...I said cash (still not sure why this matters?!). I notice the ticket on my bag says order #11, which is another bad sign because any delivery place on a Friday night in the middle of a busy city should have more than 11 orders by 11 pm. I pay and I go because I do not want to be alone with this dude any longer. \\n\\nThe salad feels heavy which is a nice sign (usually) because it means you're getting your money's worth with fresh ingredients. There's nothing worse than paying for a salad when it's just basically lettuce and a couple of scraps of other things.\\n\\nWhile this salad definitely had stuff in it, approximately 0% of the stuff in it looked appetizing. Immediately upon opening the container, you could smell the olives, and not in a good way. It smelled like bad olives. Sour olives. The shrimp was this awkward brownish grey color...and there were soggy grilled vegetables all over the place. The lettuce was iceberg. The only thing that looked fresh and somewhat appetizing was the boiled egg, but I guess it's hard to serve bad eggs to customers even when you're a crappy place.\\n\\nBecause this meal entailed shrimp and shellfish poisoning is not a joke, I threw the whole salad away. It might be a little unfair to judge food without tasting it, but the smell of the olives literally made my stomach churn. I had to light a candle after throwing it away. Judging from the other reviews and what I had observed, fighting to get my $11 back would have been pointless, and honestly, this guy needs that $11 more than I do. \\n\\nI hope the owners figure out that the restaurant business isn't really for them and close up shop...it would save them some $$$. :("},{"name":"Chago's Caribbean Cuisine","address":"7301 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It's indeed great place to hang out with friends!

Located in an office building on the 30th floor, Portland City Grill has a great view of the city and mountains.  Plus, on Sundays, it's all day happy hour! \\n\\nThe problem though with coming to Portland City Grill is that most likely, all of the window seats/tables are taken, especially on a Sunday.  We came here here in the early afternoon and the place was busy and all of the window tables were taken, so we sat at the bar until a table became available.  And that's what everyone does, scoping out the entire place until we see a party start to shift!  You have to be aggressive though because seriously, everyone is eyeing a window table.  \\n\\nWhen asked about a featured rose on happy hour, the bartender showed me the bottle of rose, which I started with.  Until I got my bill did I learn that it was not on happy hour, so that was disappointing.  However, they do have featured beers less than six bucks and craft cocktails for ten bucks.  The food menu on happy hour is solid.  There are several good deals on the fare here, including more entree plates like the burger, for 10 bucks.  My friend and I shared the Waffle Fries, which were seasoned with ranch and had a side of fry sauce!  Fry sauce is life!  \\n\\nOverall, Portland City Grill is a nice spot for the views and happy hour.

Number one the acoustics and layout lend itself to a brutal dining experience. You cannot hear yourself talk and you are often times on top of your neighbor.  The location is in the middle of the land time forgot.  So this is what happens to flat ugly strip mall infested land that is abandoned for 30 years?   The hostess went off on the other half of our party because we got stuck in I-4 traffic and were 15 minutes late. Arrogant and rude without backing it up with product is no way to go through life. I ate here five times with the old owners when the place was fabulous and two really bad times since the sale.  I won't go back.  Let's start with the french onion soup.  I am familar with the serving of soup in two portions cup or bowl, never before was I familiar with soup being served in a glorified thimble.  The three bites of the french onion soup had good flavor but did not have the over the top cheese layer that usually makes the dish.  The bread was mediocre, perhaps they should contract out to WaWa, it would be an improvement.  The Beef Bourguignon was tough and dry and the apple tart thoroughly underwhelmed.  Basically this is just like the old Le Coq Au Vin except the portions are smaller, the prices are higher, and the food is worse.  If you don't mind those minor adjustments, have at it.  I think what has happened here is that it is still busy because those that were regulars when this place was good are so old they no longer have tastebuds and they don't care if they are going to get fleeced on a meal because they have nothing else to spend their money on.

I would have never known on my own\\". \\nSo, since that day, this has become a regular once every couple of months place I drop in for a bite. Their sandwiches are mostly of the panini variety and they offer various soups and salads as well. Their pricing can't beat the $5 deal of Subway but, if you are willing to pay a couple of bucks more I think they are certainly a better tasting lunch. The ingredients all seem pretty fresh and the sandwich I regularly order is called \\"adobe\\" which is made up of turkey, mozzarella cheese, green peppers, chipotle mayo, and corn relish (which leaves little corn kernels all over the wrapper every time I eat and provide me with a fun afternoon snack of picking up corn kernels with my fingers). I also often get a small bowl of their broccoli and cheddar soup, which is good but has a bit much salt in it.\\nSo, if you get a full sandwich and a small bowl of soup, it sets you back about 10 bucks. You can, of course, skip the soup and you'll be out $7 OR they offer some kind of half sand and small soup or salad combo deal for $6.50.\\nOnly downside?

Their seafood Gumbo reminds me of the bowl I had the first time I visited New Orleans. \\n\\nWe chose to sit at the bar as we usually do and the bartender tonight was right on point. He was very attentive to our needs and even though we were not drinking just made our night enjoyable by paying attention to all of the details. I was drinking unsweet tea with lime and the tea is very good but my glass never reached the bottom. When a busy bartender notices your glass is nearing empty, that is a good bartender. Serving food, making drinks and noticing the details...  GREAT JOB!\\n\\nTonight the wife had the Crawfish Po Boy and dirty rice and of course I had to take a bite just to \\"Make Sure\\" is was a good as usual. lol Yes, it was just as good and the last time I had one and their dirty rice is one of the best you will find. They could serve that plate in The Big Easy with pride. I feasted on the Jambalaya, Crawfish Pie and Chicken File Gumbo even though I was fighting the urge to get the Shrimp and Grits AGAIN... lol I knew I planned to tell everybody about my trip here so I figured I would change it up a bit. I took a bite of the Jambalaya and just enjoyed a food moment. I would try to describe how good it was BUT words can't do it justice. I mixed my rice into the Chicken File Gumbo and that first bit just made me stop, close my eyes and again enjoy another food moment. I could not do it justice with words so I won't try. Finally I took a bit of that crawfish pie. I have never had crawfish pie before but the crust was a perfect complement for that crawfish delight hidden inside. I had to force myself to share a bite with my wife because it was that good. 3 of those and a bowl of the Gumbo would make a great lunch dish!\\n\\nMy advice for those of you that have NOT been to Tibby's is to check it out...  You have NO IDEA what you are missing. For those of you that have been to The Big Easy, you will feel like you are there because the decor and the food makes you feel like you are there. For those of you afraid to step out of your comfort zone and check them out...  Your loss...  Well that and more for me!!!  I felt like a tourist taking a few pictures of the place tonight but I will post them on Yelp and Tripadvisor along with my review..."},{"name":"The Charlatan","address":"1447 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"If you need a place to relax without feeling uncomfortable this place is a good choice. Rocked up on a Friday evening for casual after work drinks and some food. Nice place for solo travellers as the bar is shaped like a square with bar stools around it so you don't feel awkward. I didn't come solo I brought my other half who is one of the most critical/fussy eaters you'll ever meet but on this occasion he couldn't speak highly enough of the 'Meat' burger which he consumed in under 3 minutes!! I opted for the healthier more humane choice of the veggie burger which was just ok but the yam fries killed it - perfection! Would I come back? Better than most on the drive but I would probably try somewhere else first.."},{"name":"The Soup Peddler Real Food & Juice Bar","address":"501 W Mary St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Not the biggest fan of the actual soups.

When we arrived we had a birthday cake and gave it to the hostess. She asked us without hesitation if it needed to go in the freezer or fridge. We said the freezer as it was an ice cream cake. She said 'no problem' and took it from us and proceeded to lead us to our table. From there on it was a pretty mediocre experience. We ordered drinks and some of us got our and others didn't. We asked for an extra chair for someone who was running late and it never came. The food was nothing special for the price and so on and so forth. The reason why I would never recommend this place to anyone was because when we asked the waitress to bring out the birthday cake, she said \\"ok no problem, just give us 1 minute.\\" Then 10 minutes later the manager comes up to our table and says \\"I am sorry but it is against food and safety regulations to serve the birthday cake. We can present it to you but we can't give you any forks or plates.\\" First of all, I have my complete FoodSafe Canada certification and my family owns a few restaurants in which I grew up in and had most of my work experience in and I can confidently say there is no \\"safety regulation\\" against serving a birthday cake. Secondly my friend kindly told the manager that we were not informed of this when we made the reservation/arrived and the hostess took the cake from us without question. The manager got really defensive and rude and basically told us flat out that we were wrong and delusional and the hostess never did such a thing (yet the cake was still in their freezer). He then proceeded to get very nervous and started to stutter and not be able to look any of us in the eye. When the bill came, the tip was included, adding insult to injury. We ended up getting our cake back and it is safe to say my friends birthday dinner was ruined thanks to the Italian Kitchen. However we took the cake down the street to a Tim Hortans and asked them to light it up and serve it to us and they did it happily. All in all I will NEVER recommend the Italian Kitchen to anyone! You can buy canned pasta that tastes the same and not have to deal with their awful staff while saving yourself mega $$. Not worth it at all."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I came here to carbo-load the night before the Boston Marathon.  I knew that it was going to be scorching 80+ degrees at the marathon so I had already lost all PR hope, and was ready to eat more than my normal pre-race amount!  We ordered a pizza to start, then I had some crisp buttery naan, then a spaghetti dish.  Everything was simple, but delicious.  They have a brick oven of some sort where they make all their fresh breads, so anything on the menu served on a bed of of baked carbs is good.  I enjoyed my simple tomato sauced spaghetti, but there was nothing distinctive about it.  I would normally have ordered something slightly more complex, but I am prone to stomach problems during races.  The only complaint I have with the spaghetti is that it came with a small amount of cheese on top which wasn't mentioned in the description on the menu.  This was fine, but I usually also avoid dairy the day before a long run too.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 desserts to split between 6 people.  The tiramisu was fine.  The passion fruit panna cotta was better.\\n\\nService was ok.  The place was very busy so our server was often elsewhere when we needed him.

Also, the driver either went 50mph around a corner or he dropped the bag. When I opened the box, both the pizza and dessert, had been tossed to one side of the box. When I called to speak with the manager he put me on hold for 7 min and when he finally found my order he blamed me for not creating an account, so he could have \\"easily found the correct order.\\" He sent another pizza, not the dessert, and the pizza had half the cheese.

They have a fair selection of burgers; so far I've had the chili cheese burger with Fritos and the Swiss and mushroom burger. Both were cooked about medium-well and still juicy.  They have some other choices that I definitely want to try. The buns seemed like sweet buns (my favorite kind of burger buns), but didn't taste quite like sweet buns--still good though. I think my favorite thing so far are the fries, since they're cooked all the way through and somewhat breaded, so they're soft and fluffy inside and crispy out. My friend has had their sweet potato fries and the onion rings and loves both. I may get onion rings next time I go.\\n\\nA combo meal (possibly only for lunch) costs just $7.99 and includes any burger, fries and a 32 oz. drink--an awesome deal IMO.

However, it always too them a while to figure out how to push the tables together in the otherwise empty dining room and would not let us help them.

Allow me to elaborate:\\n\\n- Their hot sauce consists of two ingredients: chili powder, and melted butter. A LOT of melted butter. That's it. Ever considered drinking the butter you get alongside crab/lobster? Similar taste and consistency, I imagine. \\n\\n- Once upon a time, the smoked sausage was a delicious and hearty link with flavorful pork and spices. Now it tastes like the Devil pinched a bright red loaf onto a bun, put some Dijon mustard on it, and stuck it on your plate. \\n\\n- Didn't see it on the menu, so this one isn't as big a deal, but....I asked if (beyond all hope or reason) they had burnt ends.

I actually just contacted Groupon about them they were so bad.  It took 4 hours for my friends and I to have dinner.  I had to speak with a manager after 2 hours to get the main entree, while our waiter continued to serve the tables around us.  People who were seated after us were served and gone long before we received our dessert.  The waiter then ran my friend's card for charges not covered by the groupon and she found that it was run for an amount greater than the receipt we received.  Ths charge was apparently for a  drink, which he then said I had to pay full price for instead of the nightly special of half price because I used a Groupon.  The waiter then lied repeatedly saying he was the manager (directly followed by this is his first time dealing with omission and additions to bills).  When I was finally able to speak to the manager at the end of the night, it was 1. not the same person I spoke with earlier and 2. he was very dismissive of our concerns about the waiters lying, and (basically) fraudlent charges on my friends card.  He attributed it to them offering the Groupon, so it was busy.  Several other customers experienced the same issue - additional charges on the signature receipt as compared to the original receipt.  Oh, AND they were improperly charging gratuity for parties of less than 4 (the stated policy on the menu and restaurant website) instead of allowing us to designate the amount we were going to pay (on the value of the meal, by the way).  They said the terms of the Groupon stated they would automaticaly add gratuity to any meal paid for with a Groupon (which isn't what mine said).  His solution was that  we should come back for another meal and he'd give us a free hookah -I must've looked like an idiot if he thought  would buy that so he could tell me that he didnt' know who I was or what I was talking about.

None of those $9 one-time use disposable razors that shave as well as rubbing your leg against an old brick building here!\\n\\nI really do appreciate stores like Whole Foods who only carry specific brands, but let's be real, there are times when you want the box of Bagel Bites or the handful of Flaming Hot Cheetos and the all organic cayenne-spiced Wisconsin cheese curd puffs aren't going to cut it. I also like knowing I can save a little cash if I need to, because there are so many options. I can't tell you how many times I have been to the register at WF's and realized I just spent $75 on one quick dinner. I mean, I could have eaten my weight in meat at Fogo for the same cost, people! #perspective \\n\\nWegmans has something for everyone.

We waited like 10 minutes to be greeted by someone and seated. There was no one in the restaurant and our order took 45 minutes.

The place was hopping busy as usual and the service didn't really lack.  Our servers were professional, courteous and assisted in a number of photo's for us.  They knew the menu well and were well versed in describing and helping with some dishes we were not too sure about.  \\n\\nI'm going to do a basic take on each of my dinner companions experiences from what I've heard so you get a varied opinion of options in this review.\\n\\nMy brother who's a Yelper but doesn't write.\\n     He had Pasta, doesn't really matter which one it was,  It was good, the pasta was toothsome and the sauce was decent, but he was expecting more.  For him it was average and deserving of a solid A-OK.  The wine was nice and paired well with his food. (I thought so too).  His take on the Pizza was about the same, maybe a half notch down.  Toppings could be more?\\n\\nMy Cheerful friend who Yelps and writes and has a good sense for food.  \\n     She ordered pasta, but didn't want the olives in it. Although the olives were omitted from her pasta dish, it still had this olive like DRS taste to it.  Pasta was only 1/4 eaten.\\nPizza - ok.  Nothing to write home about.\\n\\nMy Handsome friend who says \\"What's Social Media\\"\\n      He didn't like the Pizza.  Something bitter didn't appeal to him (it was radicchio.  Bear in mind these are all based on personal tastes, I like the pizza).  Crust was ok.\\n     Burrata with prosciutto was ok. it was different compared to the one he had experienced in Quebec.  If you never had it before, you'd probably rate it well.  For his discerning tastebuds having been spoiled by a perfected 5 star rated Burrata,  I would come to the conclusion that Italian's Kitchens version would come to a 3.5 star.  Still that's pretty good.  This is supposed to be one of Italian Kitchens specialty dishes.  It's worth the try.\\n     Pasta was al-dente good, but like my brothers pasta, it was  average.\\nWine a good paring and decent.  \\n    CRACK ON A PLATE - is what we called the Brussel Sprout side dish which was excellent.  So good, worthy of the five star rating, but something that good can't be good for you.  Everyone like the side dishes.  We also ordered a Kale which was nearly as good.  I'd give it a 4 star.\\n\\nMy meal started off good.  The side dishes were as described the same as above.\\nMy take on the Pizza was the crust, the bottom part, the dough made the pizza not stick out and that hand crafted feeling, the poppy bubbly crust I was hoping for wasn't there.  3 stars for me.\\nBurrata, I liked it. I'd give it a 3.5 to 4 stars.\\nThe main course - I got the Salmon which started out good. Meat was cooked medium rare which  I like. It wasn't dry and the flavour was good. I was about to write it up with a 4 star.  Then came the bone in my meat and that stopped that.  Normally when I encounter a bone in my fish I stop eating right there and then.\\nI did just that. Stopped eating and that was that.  Still my main course was deserving of a good rating.  The veggies underneath were flavorred well, maybe too well.  \\n\\nSo here's my take on last night meal which in normal circumstances I would rate this place higher.  see previous reviews.\\n\\nThe place was busy - It's hard to provide good quality food and keep pumping out dishes the way they should be prepared..\\n\\nMe being superstitious, I came in the evening when I usually come in the afternoon.\\nI sat at a different table...  hahahahhaa.\\n\\nService - B+\\nFood - C+\\nPresentation B\\nPasta - al-dente - A+\\nSauces for Pasta - B in most parts.\\nSalmon - B+  (with bone in - C- but that is my own personal issue with bones)\\nSide dishes - B+\\nCrack on a plate AKA Brussel Sprouts - A\\nDesert - C+ \\n\\nShoulda had the meatballs."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The views of the city are unbeatable - absolutely breathtaking.

I've been here before when it used to be Fulton's Crab House. The entrance needs a little change though. It didn't really have a sign or a carpet that hints the entrance door. I just remember that Fulton's used to have a sign right above the door making it easier to know where to go. \\n\\nI was on holiday for the weekend and I was meeting a good friend for brunch. We're major foodies and we enjoy going to as many restaurants as we can to get that perfect meal, picture, and review. Neither of us have been here since its change so we were a little excited. Our reservation was right at 11:30am and we were seated right away on the side of the boat next to a window. We had the whole section to ourselves which was nice for good conversation. \\n\\nFor our starters, my friend ordered the Crab Fries and I ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes. The Crab Fries were ok. The fries were nicely crunchy and not burnt. The crab and the dressing were just plopped on top/middle and not really mixed throughout the rest of the fries. My Fried Green Tomatoes weren't to my liking. They were fried a little too much so I got more crunchy batter instead of the nice sweet flavor of the tomatoes. \\n\\nFor our entrees, I ordered the Fried Clam Roll with a New England Clam Chowder substitute for the fries (I know, clam overload!). My friend ordered off the Brunch Menu, which I have to admit was very limited (4 items) and very disappointing (no bottomless mimosas!). She ended up choosing the Crab and Asparagus Benedict. The dish comes with grilled bacon slab and my friend doesn't eat bacon. She asked our server if there's something else that they can substitute it with (another meat or a vegetable), I was surprised when our server said that they couldn't substitute the bacon with anything else. We're not picky eaters, but my friend strictly does not eat bacon so I was very disappointed when she couldn't sub something that she can't eat for something else that she can. She was happy with her dish at least. The poached eggs were nicely topped on the challah bread, and everything mixed very well. \\nAs for my Fried Clam Roll, it was good. I probably should've ordered it with the pickles on the side, but it was still good. There was a little mix up with my order and I was still brought fries instead of my soup. Nothing I would complain about, but it does waste fries and I already ate quite a few from my friend's Crab Fries. I do have to say that their New England Clam Chowder was delicious! It was thick and creamy and a good amount of clams in the soup. \\n\\nAs for drinks, my friend ordered the Southern Sangria (Medley Bros. Bourbon, peach liqueur, Tempranillo, seasonal fruit). I took a sip, myself, and it was sweet and very strong. She was satisfied with it. \\n\\nFor the overall experience, it was ok. I understand that this restaurant is on Disney property, so yes I thought it was overpriced. We primarily came here for brunch but we were very unsatisfied with the brunch menu. I would've thought they'd have more choices and especially drink specials! What's a brunch without a bottomless mimosa option?? Maybe this place is better for dinner only, I'm not sure. Also, our server seemed a little unsure about what other options can go with the dishes. I would hope that he'd be more prepared for guests who have strict diets and know what the alternatives are. I don't recommend doing their brunch since they don't really have much to offer. Since Disney Springs has a lot more restaurants to choose from now, Paddlefish needs to step up their game to grab the guests' attention."},{"name":"Nick's Pizza & Subs","address":"65 Granite St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"I feel very nostalgic about Nick's because it's down the road from my mom's old office where I also worked during high school.

The meat was so tender and melted in the mouth with every bite. The flavor was a soy sauce based, semi-spicy sauce which reminded me so much of back home. It tasted somewhat as if Sam Choy would've cooked it up, very PacRim~y. The short ribs came on a bed of Danish blue cheese mashed potatoes and veggies, also very tasty. \\n\\nMy dining experience at PCG was great and can't wait to make another trip in the near future.

We ordered some pastillos which looked like fried empanadas pretty much stuffed with pulled pork and monterrey cheese.

Michael always is friendly and smiling. Lisa always says hello and is helpful. The people in the deli know I love the chowder and always tell me when it's available. A great team!

The birthday boy called Saturday to make a reservation. They told him they don't take any but that they'll make an exception for him and will reserve a table for 10:30 AM. We got there and that was a giant lie. We waited until noon to be seated. Maybe that was their way of working up our appetite idk. The wait was only mitigated by the birthday boy buying rounds of mimosas.\\n\\nWhen we were seated the food didn't take TOO long to come out. I got the huevos rancheros which were delicious - I was able to replace the meat with avocado instead and they didn't skimp on the avocado, which I appreciate. \\n\\nThe combo of beans, egg, salsa, and avocado is DELISH. Portion could have been bigger given 13$ charge but I was decently full. They also bring out complimentary berry bread with like 10000% real butter so that helped fill me up.\\n\\nThe side of bacon is DELICIOUS. Crispy, with the perfect amount of the maple syrup taste. Best bacon I've ever had. \\n\\nWarning though - spike coffee is no joke. The taste at first is good, but as soon as you swallow it feels like you are taking a vodka shot. A bit much for a Sunday afternoon for me. Their drinks overall were pretty strong (not a bad thing)."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Food here is awesome and totally worth the wait..

The end result was quite solid (although I'm unsure how my patience would fare in future visits).  \\n\\nWhen you come into Neptune Oyster, you'll discover why the wait time is so long.  The restaurant is pretty tight and small so make sure you're ready to rub shoulders with your friends and neighbors.  One of the great things about Neptune is that they have a great wine list and a tasty one at that.  We had the Vera bottle for about $30 which wasn't too shabby.  As their name also suggests, they also have a good amount of raw seafood.  We had three of the oysters (really can't name them - they all were quite good though) as a checklist is given to you to (prices ranged from $2-$8).  Service was good too and attentive.  \\n\\nThen came the main target - the lobster roll.  I got the buttery iteration.  Let me tell you - it was BUTTERY - not the point of disgust but to the point where I was delighted and fearful for how unhealthy/tasty it was.  The lobster was also quite delicious and fresh and the bread was pretty good (although you can literally taste how soggy it was due to the butter).  It rivals the Barking Crab as one of my favorite lobster rolls in town.

In fact, it's something I've only really started to incorporate into my diet over the last few years.  I've tried to be a little more daring, especially when I travel, and I've gotten to the point where I can appreciate good seafood when it's done right, but the majority of the time I still opt for land dwelling proteins.\\n\\nI was entertaining a few friends for the weekend and one of them wanted some New England clam chowder for dinner.  I saw all of Neptune's stellar reviews on Yelp and after a quick walk from the waterfront, we put our name in for a table.  It was around 5:15pm so the place wasn't too crowded but as soon as we were greeted by the hostess about 5 more parties showed up.  We had made it just in the nick!  Sitting on a random stoop resting our sore feet, watching our \\"5-10 minute\\" wait slowly creep into a half an hour, I started to get grouchy.  The hostess seemed annoyed by us as we checked on our underestimated wait time.  I eyed the menu warily due to the high prices and interesting (read: frightening) varieties of fish and seafood and was all set to hate the place.\\n\\nWhen we eventually did get to sit in the bar-lined tiny rectangular room all of my frustration melted away.  Upon closer inspection, I found the menu creative and intelligent and actually couldn't decide what to order between all of the tasty items.  I wasn't so daring as to take advantage of the raw bar but the table next to us, which we were cozily close to, tried several kinds of oysters and seemed very pleased.\\n\\nWe began with blood orange bellinis which mostly tasted like champagne to me but their crispness was a perfect compliment to the upcoming seafood.  The lobster caprese was sumptuous perfection with enormous chunks of beautifully cooked lobster and fresh buffalo mozzarella, halved red and yellow cherry tomatoes, delicate greens, and a splash of pesto and olive oil.  I tasted this salad slowly, trying to savor every element, looked up from my plate and proclaimed, \\"I have never felt this way about lobster before!\\"  And it's true.  Far from the heavy disguised lobster bisque of my past, this salad was fresh and light and complex and my mouth waters just thinking about it.\\n\\nNeptune's has also perfected the art of the sear.  On Saturdays the special is tuna and this one was cooked just right and served over greens, salty bacon, and creamy avocado, with a side of soft-shell crab.  I ordered the scallops which were nestled amongst mission figs, beets, tomatoes, and a gorgonzola fonduta which added a richness to the creamy melty scallops.  I would risk disease for this undercooked shellfish anyday.  I asked my friend how his mussel dish was and he shook his head and said \\"It was terrible,\\" smiling down on an enormous bowl of empty shells.\\n\\nThe service was the kind of subtle perfection I dream of providing in my own restaurant some day (if I were ever to open one)- magically refilled water glasses, empty plates disappearing from your table before you even know they're gone, salesmanship, personality, and best of all, an extensive knowledge of the food.  This smoothness was especially impressive in such a small and busy space.  The waitresses could have easily been bumping the back of my chair all night or trying to push us out the door.\\n\\nI think the main reason I was able to enjoy the seafood even as the most moderate fish consumer was the ease of the presentation.  I didn't see anyone eating a whole lobster and hacking away violently at the shells.  There were no fish eyes or scales or anything to suggest the previous slimy life of the food on my plate.  Everything was fresh and flavorful and elegantly presented and I couldn't have asked for more.  As you can tell by the novel I just wrote, Neptune's is wonderful.  They provide the kind of meal that transports you, relaxes you, and feeds your soul.  The prices were higher than my usual but not too high for a meal like this.  It was my first true 5-star meal experience of the summer."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I took a trip to Portland and ate at a lot of amazing restaurants that were popular on Yelp.

But when I want something more from my Italian food, I can't bow down to the false gods in the North End any longer. The best Italian food in Boston isn't in the North End anymore. It's in Bay Village at Erbaluce, Porter Square at Giulia, and now the South End at Bar Mezzana. FIGHT ME IF YOU WANNA, I'm sticking to my guns on this.\\n\\nBar Mezzana has the Lynch Gruppo pedigree, a hip location, and a focused menu, so my expectations were sky high going in, and they were still met. Here's the full rundown:\\n\\nWe started with crudo, as it seemed to be a central part of the experience. We got a kingfish crudo that was citrus-y and sweet thanks to Meyer lemon, with herbs and a bit of spice. Truth be told I hardly remember it because the bluefin tuna tartare was so out of this world. It was an ample portion of really good tuna, topped with flower petals and caviar, plated atop a thin puree of herbs. It all came together wonderfully: the caviar provided fat, salt, and fishiness, the tuna was clean and firm, and the herbs helped balance everything out with some less pronounced green flavors. I shoveled it into my mouth by the forkful with no regard for bystanders. I only wish I had some edible vessel, crostini perhaps, with which to maneuver it into my face. I will echo some other reviewers on the price points of the crudo by saying that the tuna was worth every penny, but the kingfish felt overpriced for 4 pieces of fish. But I don't know the costs of the dish, so I'll stop there.\\n\\nMoving on, we skipped the crostini creations, prosciutto, and antipasti. Heathens, I know, but we wanted to ensure that we had enough room for pasta, an entree, and dessert. I'm glad we did this, because we left very full.\\n\\nFor pasta, I had the orechiette with sausage and radicchio. It was dynamite. The pasta was deliciously gluten-y, the sausage was flavored with fennel and chili, and there weren't any unnecessary complications. Perfect pasta, sausage, a little radicchio, done. My fiancee had the lobster paccheri, which was even better. Same execution: perfect al dente tube noodles with a nice portion of lobster. This dish had some heat to it, but the sweet lobster and sun-dried tomatoes married with the spice perfectly and each bite was balanced.\\n\\nWe split an entree, the chicken under a brick. It's a half chicken with panzanella and broccoli rabe. I love this dish, and this was a great presentation. The chicken was moist and tasted like chicken (all to easy to screw up when cooking chicken), the skin was crispy, and the panzanella was a great accompaniment, providing sweet from balsamic vinegar and acidity from the tomatoes. I know... go to a seafood-focused Italian restaurant and order chicken? What am I suggesting? Some damn good chicken, that's what.\\n\\nDessert was two items: the gianduja tart for her, and the blueberry crostata for me. Hers was super chocolatey, with caramel and olive oil somewhere. I ate a bite of it and moved on to mine, which was phenomenal. First, it was huge. Second, the blueberry flavor was awesome and the pastry itself was nearly perfect. And third, the corn gelato was a crazy injection of hyper sweet corn flavor, while also being a great complement to the berries. Who knew?\\n\\nI should note, we also took advantage of their impressively curated wine list and grabbed a bottle of sparkling rosato to help us say goodbye to the warm summer weekends we've been having. The cocktails, wine, and beverage service in general were all great.\\n\\nTo close, Bar Mezzana was great and we'll be back. Service was friendly and natural, while being very attentive. Next time, we'll probably eat a bunch of stuff we didn't have this time, but I'm sure it'll be great. We spent a lot of money on a meal, but didn't have to. You could easily go with a date and grab a cocktail, split prosciutto or antipasti, get a pasta dish apiece, and share a dessert and be out (and very full) for ~$100. Sure, it ain't cheap. But that's a hell of a deal for the food you'll get. The real price drivers on the menu are the crudo and cocktails. Are they worth it? Yes, probably (especially that tuna tartare for $13), but they aren't an absolutely crucial part of your meal here. All in all, a fantastic and fun meal that showcased a lot of great variety in Italian cuisine. Looking forward to returning."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"13586 Village Park Dr, Ste 306","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Having been stationed in Japan for 2 years I guess this place is ok."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been coming here for years for the half pound hamburger.

We were positioned with a complete view of the restaurant, the pass shelf, and the kitchen - and I had a great view of the tandoor and how the cook hand-rolled the naan and placed it inside the oven.  Service was friendly and informative, though I do suspect that we may have been forgotten about a time or two - which was fine except for my water glass often needed refilled (per usual).  \\n\\nOur appetizers included some of that day's specials (a potato croquette or something similar to a samosa), garlic naan, the chutneys, beet salad.  All were excellent.  The chutneys and raita were the perfect accompaniment to everything we had going on at the table.  All four of us ordered a different entree, which we all sampled:  the pork vindalho was delicious but damn spicy (almost too spicy); the chicken tikka was exceptional - tender, juicy, and the table's favorite; the chicken curry was good and well-prepared; and the kashmiri paneer was acceptable, though that was the one dish that left something to be desired (maybe more sauce?).  \\n\\nI don't know how, but we came close to finishing nearly everything on that table.  On a service note, my husband's tikka was not served with the rest of the entrees and we were told it was somehow forgotten.  Our server brought him soup to tide him over, a ****ton of papadum for the table, and also comped one of our appetizers because of the delay.\\n\\nWe can't wait to return!"},{"name":"Fatburger","address":"Harbour Centre, 555 W Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"This location is in Harbour Centre.

In the future it might make more sense for the restaurant to ladle out portions or serve with small bowls. I didn't try the pork belly but my colleagues enjoyed it.

However, if you want to eat at Narcoossee's, Wishes is a nice side benefit. \\n\\nWe made our reservation AFTER the fireworks, which is a nice tip for those of you who, like us, think small children have no place in fine dining. If I'm paying $100 per person for dinner, your little darling flinging crumbs and screeching is not what I want. Post-fireworks you get a much better crowd - and this is true of pretty much any Disney fine dining, fireworks view or not, except V&A's, which has a minimum age requirement (and is worth every penny for that reason alone).\\n\\nThe ambience is sort of New Englandy, but in an Old World way, not an overly kitschy one. The service is mature and attentive but not cloying. It was our first anniversary, and we were immediately brought complimentary champagne with strawberries on the rim. Lovely. Plus, our menus were custom-printed with anniversary wishes.\\n\\nThe food is outstanding. The bread is pretty standard upscale fare, but the butter with Hawaiian sea salt makes it special. The lovely pink salt is sprinkled on the butter, not mixed in, so it adds a delightful crunchy texture in contrast to the velvet mouth feel of a good, high-fat butter. You had me at fat.\\n\\nWe both ordered surf and turf, and neither disappointed. The steaks were cooked as requested and were delicious, and the vegetables were wonderful (mashed potatoes and tender-crisp green beans).

The almond cheesecake lives up to its reputation, and the pecan chocolate torte was borderline illegal. Frankly, I like it better, and that's saying something because that was some fine cheesecake indeed. We ordered a Godiva flight, which was (a) exceptionally reasonably priced in comparison to basically everything else on the menu, and (b) stunning from beginning to end. Caramel, chocolate, and white chocolate Godiva, each with a strawberry and a filled squeeze dropper perched on the glass. The idea is that you bite the strawberry and squeeze the liqueur in your mouth simultaneously.

I can make my tacos a lot healthier which is really important to me.  I don't particularly feel proud of the consumption of flour tortillas or potatoes, but when I can load it with fresh raw veggies I feel like it makes up for a lot.  Here's what you do - (using their smaller containers as measurement) mix all 3 salsas in one of the plastic containers (they lack a balance of flavors separately - too smoky, too spicy, and too bland), dump that whole thing on your taco, top with another container full of pico de gallo, grab a whole mess of cilantro (maybe 1/3 cup?), and sometimes a squirt of lime.

Located on Aloma in the Shopping Center by the Aloma Cinema, Tibby's is a New Orleans-style restaurant that really gets it right.\\n\\nWe went inside and were able to get a table fairly quickly. The restaurant is split into a bar (1/4) area and a restaurant (3/4) area. While there isn't a window to see out front, there is TONS of New Orleans-themed artwork and style all around you. We sat down at our table and were quickly created by Ken. Ken was a very knowledgeable server who walked us through the entire menu and gave great recommendations. \\n\\nAfter taking a look at their expansive menu, we decided to get some Hurricanes to start (only $5 during happy hour), as well as the Crawfish and Fried Green Tomatoes appetizer. The Hurricane had a very good amount of alcohol (rare for a sweet drink), and the appetizer was tasty and included a zangy remoulade sauce that went well with the solid crawfish and fried green tomatoes. While the server said the appetizer was on the small side, it could easily serve as an entree for most people.\\n\\nAfter finishing our drinks, we put in an order for a schooner of draft beer. We didn't know what that was, but it turned out to essentially be a huge goblet! We combined that with a Carrot and Goat Cheese Salad with a side of fried oysters (see my wife's review for details) and some Chicken and Waffles to go with our drinks and the college football game up on the tv. The tasty chicken and waffles dish also came with bacon and cheese on it, as well as some delicious brandy sauce. I decided to order the seafood gumbo on the side rather than the sweet potato fries, but the gumbo wasn't that great and was the only downside to my meal. \\n\\nOverall, Tibby's is an awesome Cajun restaurant with good service, tasty and cheap food, and a fun atmosphere.

He used to know almost everyone there before management changed, as it does frequently now. With that said, I believe I have a good overall feeling for what Joey D's Oakroom is.\\n\\nFirst of all, the service is impeccible. I worked there for a few weeks (not biased) but I know first hand that your service will always be perfect. They even make the servers put the protein(meat) on the dish facing towards you, all food runners and waiters must know your number at the table and WILL make sure no one has to ask, although it does sometimes happen. Life goes on.\\n\\nI find it a rare occasion that I still have room for my entree after sharing an appetizer, having their  fresh salads with included honey glazed croissant, and a drink or two. Some reviewers say its slightly over priced. I say with all the service and extras you get included with your entree, it is more than fair. I wish I could give 4.5 stars, the only minus being the very few sub-par dishes I have had there. Some reviewers tend to disagree with my opinion.\\n\\nSteak - Joey D's is a steakhouse first, their steaks are perfectly cooked and of decently high quality. Not what I typically order, but have sampled family/friends steak orders, and always good. One thing they will tell you IF you ask, their steaks are cooked slightly less than most places. If you order a medium-rare, expect it to be rare, as good steak should be cooked only as long as humanly consumable. If you order your steak anything over medium, perhaps you should try another kind of meat.\\n\\nNow for a list of what I have tried and quality of flavor. Note, all sandwiches at Joey D's Oakroom are huge. Do NOT expect to be chumped by ordering one. Tons of meat on all.\\n\\nShort Rib Ravioli - Absolutely delicious, mushroom sauce, mmm. \\nLobster Ravioli - An appetizer that suits well as an entree, delicious.\\nRoast Beef Sandwich - Sandwich itself is a little lacking in flavor, au jus for dipping is beautiful though, makes up for the sub-par sandwich.\\nOak Room Burger - Decent, nothing to rave about. Fries also decent.\\nReuben Sandwich - Good, not 5 star good, but good. A typical Reuben.\\nFilet Mignon Salad - Low carb(if you care) and super tasty. I get mine rare, bleu cheese crumbles, the vinegarette is nice too. I usually substitute for their house-made bleu cheese dressing though. Mmmmm\\nCaesar Salad - Good.\\nRaw Oyster Shooters - Add Tobasco, only way I truely like oysters. Good.\\nOysters Rockafeller - Not a fan, sorry. \\nOnion Loaf - Buncha onion rings in a cube. That sums it up.\\nChicken Wings - Probably the 2nd best wings I've ever had, the house-made bleu cheese makes it 10x better. House made ranch is good too.\\nHouse Salad - Excellent, love it. I usually get the Brooklyn French dressing. I don't taste walnuts in the salad anymore, which I like personally.\\nHoney Butter Croissants - Best croissant I've ever had. Light, flaky, slightly sweet.\\nRibs - Decent, slightly overcooked, not a fan of sweet sauce but, decent.\\nSouthwest Chicken Penne - It is what the description says it is. Its good.\\nNew Orleans Spicy Shrimp - Description SAYS its messy, and by god they are. I know how to peel shrimp like a pro, these just don't peel like that. Mine were overcooked a little bit, and the \\"spicy\\" sauce they sit in isn't that great, mostly oil. A piece of french bread is served with to dip in but, not worth it really. A slight dissapointment.\\nSides - creamed spinach is decent, capellini marinara was good, everything else is how it sounds, just sides.\\n\\nWell, I apologize for the incredibly long review, but I've been to Joey D's so many times I thought I would share my entire thoughts on it. Overall, a good place, get your money's worth and go back when you can afford. Don't be afraid to ask for to go boxes, 90% of the time I do :)"},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I found my go to Italian restaurant in Austin!\\n\\nDon't be fooled, although it looks like a food truck, this is a fine dining experience all day long.

We paid for the meter for about 2 1/2 hours and the total was $5.50.  Which is better than $15 across the street from the restaurant.  We walked a block to Tin Lizzy's.\\n\\nWe arrived and was seated immediately for a party of four.  I started asking for the $2.22 margaritas right away, LOL.  Our waiter's name was Eric.  At first he was a little stand off-ish and seemed like he was not ready for the crowd to come in and drink ALL Night, lol.  I immediately started to engage with him and tried to make things a easier for him and he softened up.  I made it clear that we were a easy table and I think we proved that.\\n\\nTin Lizzy's sent an email saying it was National Margarita and I knew I want drink and food.  We started with an appetizer from the \\"TIN DIPS.\\"  We had the The Duo, which consist of roja salsa and queso and seasoned chips. The price was $7.99.  The seasoned tortilla chips are EVERYTHING at Lizzy's.\\n\\nAfter the 3rd margarita, I was ready to order my dinner.  They have a huge variety on the menu, tacos, salads, plenty of sides, quesadillas, and skillets.  I opt for the skillet.  I ordered from the Cantina Creation Station, which is where you could pretty much make it your own way.  I order the Cantina Skillet($5.79), it was seasoned rice, grilled red peppers & onions, pickled jalapenos and crispy tortilla strips topped with queso blanco. Served with a side of salsa fresca. I added sour cream and avocado($.99) and fried chicken($2.99).  After the add-ons it was $9.77.  \\n\\nThe Cantina Skillet was worth every penny.  Everything was seasoned very well.  Only thing I forgot to do was add a little heat for spice but, I still enjoyed it.  The portion was just right for me too.  I tried to eat it all.

Had trouble finding parking.  The store front is very small, so it was really easy to miss!  There was maybe about 4-5 parking spots, which seems to be always full when we went in circles to find parking.  We thought there was parking in the back, but no luck.  We ended up doing street parking around the corner, which is not that far.\\n\\nWhile entering the establishment, I could not help but notice that the AC does not seem to be working.  It would be nice if the AC was working on a hot summer day in Austin.. Luckily there are some fans that was in there, which luckily we got to sit next to.  The only problem I had here was with the cashier...  I had told her specifically I wanted extra red and white sauce, and that I can pay for it, she replied \\"okay\\" and although she did not charge me for it, it would be nice to actually get what I specifically requested!!  I had came back up to the cashier and requested for more sauce again, after my food came out.  She only gave me the white sauce, and said that there isn't any red sauce at the moment, and that there will be some in a bit.. 10-15 minutes went by, and still no sauce.. came up to the desk, and asked again, she then gave me the sauce...  She was not busy at all, could she of not given me the sauce earlier or bring it to me?  Or did she not want to give me any and hope that I would just eat my meal without the sauce??\\n\\nAlthough the food was really delicious, the service really lacking.

My personal favorite was their Laab Moo because I'm a firm believer in the spicier the Thai food, the better! The Laab Moo is the spiciest dish on their menu, but all spice levels can be adjusted. Laab Moo is stir fried minced pork with thai chilis, mint, lime, onions, cilantro, in a savory Thai sauce. It comes with refreshing cucumbers on the side for crunch and some sticky rice for dipping. For $10/ box, the portion is HUGE and filling. This 1 dish can easily be split between 2 people, especially if you add an egg for a little extra protein. After washing it all down with their creamy Thai tea, we were in Northern Thai food heaven.\\n\\nThere are plenty of picnic tables and chairs available outside.

We chose a nice small table out of the way in the main dining room. Our waitress came over a few moments later and was very friendly - she asked if we had been there before, and when we answered no, she welcomed us and offered to answer any questions and asked how we had heard about Chago's. She  then took our drink order and gave us some time to look over the menus. Unfortunately, I think she got slammed behind the bar with to-go orders and a few other things because we did have quite a gap before she came back with our teas and took our orders. But, when she came back she did apologize for the wait, and took our order. Our order came out of the kitchen fairly quickly after that, which was appreciated. And our waitress was great after that as well from check-ins, to refills, to check. Great service!\\n\\nMy husband ordered the Carne Frita with black beans and was pretty impressed. The black beans, he said, were the best part of the plate - seasoned really well. The pork was also seasoned well, moist and flavorful. \\n\\nI ordered the Pernil Asado which was also really good. The chicken was super flavorful, moist and went really well with the peas and rice. The peas and rice were the best part of my plate - really well seasoned, moist rice that just went great with everything. I also enjoyed my salad - very fresh greens with tomatoes and cucumbers, topped with an herb vinaigrette that was lovely. Each component of the dish really sang to the other components, I enjoyed it a lot. \\n\\nThe only real beef that I have with Chago's on this visit, besides our wait before ordering when we came in, was that it was not clear on the website or on Yelp that their lunch menu is only served Weds-Fri. We were presented with their dinner menu this afternoon. We had actually come in really wanting to try their award-winning Cuban and their Pernil sandwiches. Not to say that we were disappointed at all with what we got, and we will definitely come back.

This was it. \\n\\nLets start with the negatives- \\n\\nFirst of all I read some of the reviews on this place and I've been here a few times for happy hour (HH). I must agree the food isn't great during HH. Your really paying for the view of the place, but I think most of the people who are reviewing this are not going to the dining room side of the business so they assume that the service and the food (HH food) is crummy at best. However I would say you need to experience the fine dining side before you place this on your \\"86\\" list. \\n\\nI took my GF as a surprise for our one year dating anniversary. Yeah I know, awww... \\nWe got in a little early for a 730 reservation and I did request for a window but apparently the earlier table didn't leave quick enough so we didn't get sat down until 800. We spent the 45 minutes in the bar and had some drinks and a bowl of clam chowder. \\n\\nThe claim chowder was really the worst part of this experience. It was really salty. I thought it was the bacon bits but it wasn't, it was salty and I felt my lips shrivel up. Yes it was that salty, but I didn't return it. I should have but the bread they provided to us helped it a little bit, plus when your hungry you'll eat anything whether it's salty or not. \\n\\nWe finally got to our table an the view of the Burnside Bridge was fantastic! Anyways we went ahead and ordered our entree. GF ordered the Crab Cakes entree and I ordered the Macadamia crusted chicken. When our dinner came to our table after about 20 minutes it was a work of art! The Macadamia crusted chicken was such a work of art it was a shame I had to destroy it like a jerk. Kind of felt like a bully destroying a kids sand castle.\\n\\nThis dish melts in your mouth. Nothing was wrong with it, well except the fact that I ate it all. The crab cakes were good as well. It's packed with REAL crab meat. It wasn't canned or the fake stuff. It was the real deal. Both dishes were not greasy at all. \\n\\nService was great and the place it self is worth going every once in a while.

I went today and had delicious, hot fresh lamb curry that absolutely hit the spot! I ate it with basmati rice (curry comes with a side of rice, about 1.5 cups in the serving) and then placed an additional order for a side of naan, which gives you two large pieces. Today, the naan was super fresh, hot, and glistening with butter, which is my preference (YUM)! However, on other occasions I have been to Teji's, I wasn't as impressed with the overall temperature of my food. Today was perfect though!! \\nI also ordered samosas; an order gets you two fairly large samosas and two small sauces to go with them. They were great!\\n\\nThe look of the restaurant is not impressive in any sense of the word. It is decorated to a minimal extent (no, I am not referring to a 'minimalist' style) with limited amounts of personality or \\"Indian decor\\". I would not describe it as a cute, romantic, or cozy place to eat. I would call it more of a hole-in-the-wall that suits the college vibe of The Drag wonderfully and serves some yummy Indian comfort food.\\n\\nThe service is usually good, and the wait time is usually pretty fast. You order and pay at the counter, get a number, and then the server brings you your food and drink.

We wanted to catch up (all recent college grads), and figured this would be a nice place to try for restaurant week. Some of us ordered off of the special menu, and some did not.\\n\\nTwo of us got there first and sat down and were given water. About a minute later a food runner came over asking us if we wanted water, so we pointed out that we already had some. This was just the start of the food runner and waiter obviously not communicating or paying attention. We then all ordered appetizers. One of the girl's plates came out very quickly, and then 5 minutes passed... and 10 minuets passed... and the waitress didn't notice that no one else had their dishes. Finally she checked on us and saw that there was an issue, and another 5 minutes later the rest of them came. But this awkward delay then lead to all of our main dishes coming out shortly thereafter with not enough time to eat the first course. To top it off, the salads that my friends got off of the restaurant week menu were super salty.\\n\\nThe sole piccata my friend got was rather mushy and lacked the lemon flavor she wanted in the sauce. I got the cacio e pepe as my main and their take on it was different from the traditional, which isn't what I was expecting. Instead of cheese and pepper mixed in to make it a little creamy, it was oil and pepper with a giant piece of melted cheese on top. And guess what? This dish was also SUPER SALTY (and now I'm feeling salty too!). There were giant chunks of something unidentified that were so salty I had to take them out. So I ordered garlic bread in hopes to have something soft to get rid of all the salt in my mouth... and it was hard as a rock and covered in salt! All in all it was really overwhelming, and the waitress upcharged me by offering a bigger portion that was not listed on the menu.\\n\\nThe only saving grace were the desserts which were satisfying and refreshing. But when the check came, we discovered an extra drink that we had to ask her to remove so we didn't have to pay for something we didn't buy.\\n\\nI'd say that the issue was maybe because the plates some of us got aren't normally on the menu, but I really don't know. Even the mainstays were sub-par. I've been to Alibi and the lounge upstairs and have had great experiences, including my sister's wedding party, but I won't be going back to Scampo.

Not the dueling piano concept, though they too merit some review.  No, I particularly enjoy the single piano setting, with intimate seating built around the edge of a beautiful grand piano.  I want to sit near the pianist, get to know him/her, ask their name, and chit chat about songs, song writers, composers, music arrangers, and any other myriad topics that come up when talking about a Sinatra or Nat King Cole ballad.  My spirits always perk up when I sit down, and the pianist begins to caress the ivory keys and the melodic tones and soothing sounds of a song I know jolts my memory and pulls at the strings of my heart.  \\n\\nPortland City Grill fits that bill.  Add in the fact that the place sits at the 30th floor of skyscraper downtown, and the wonderful vista of Portland accompanies the music and enhances the ambiance, you feel grateful for such a wonderful place to visit, socialize, dine at, or just relax in.\\n\\nI went there on a Wednesday night, and the place buzzed with noise, laughter and conversation.  The smells of the kitchen hung in the air, and the bustle of clinking glass from the bar and food being plated out rung through.  But there in the background, the tunes of the piano resonated, just above all the activity.  \\n\\nMy GF and I got there around 8:30p, with reservations for dinner.  But once we saw the piano, we ditched dinner plans at a window table, and settled at the piano, slipping into comfortable stools to enjoy the music, and glance out into the Portland skyline. The waitress working the area, suggested we wait until 9p to take advantage of the happy hour prices.  Awesome on her part.  That saved us quite a bit of money.  Money that we gladly passed onto the waitress and the piano player.\\n\\nThe HH menu showed lots of diversity and tempting options.  The food did not disappoint.  The Kung Pao Calamari came with a sweet and slightly spicy Asian sauce. Very tasty, perfectly deep fried, and very tender.  My GF sampled a few pieces of sushi, and the quality met my expectations.  Any state near the ocean better have great seafood.  :-)  She also enjoyed the 2 Mango Mojitos along with that.  We then topped it all off with some crispy chicken spring rolls, and we never did order the cheeseburger we planned to share.  \\n\\nOverall the experience with PC Grill made it a wonderful evening.  Music, good food, great Happy Hour prices, that is a Sweet Deal.  My only complaint comes from the long wait for service by the wait staff. But with it being so busy, I understood and just kicked back and requested another song from the piano man."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Best burgers in Columbus!

With that on the back burner, Neptune has been on the top of the list of must-try places for a long time.  I was happy to finally get that opportunity last month.\\n\\nWhile everyone raves about their lobster roll, (we ordered it hot, accompanied with fries) which is decent and of course overflowing from the bun with chunks of lobster meat, I don't think it was the best thing on the menu like everyone else says it is.  It is, however, definitely one of the cheaper priced \\"entr√©e\\" items at $27.  \\n\\nInstead, while you're at Neptune, and if you're here for the first time, please do yourself a favor and please get some oysters!!!  Neptune has a person at the window front, shucking various amounts of shell fish (oysters, clams, crab claws, prepping shrimp for shrimp cocktail, etc), which definitely entices people walking along on the street.  The oysters come at roughly ~$3 a pop, but are all definitely worth it.   You are given a paper sheet with about 15 different varieties of oysters.  Each oyster comes with a description stating the size, where it comes from, and the flavor/finish it relates to.  Champagne? Honey Dew? Popcorn finish?  Hells friggen yes!\\n\\nAfterwards, make sure to order the Seared Georges Bank Scallops ($33 - d'anjou pear butter, Long Island duck confit, Brussels sprouts, Maytag blue).  The scallops had a great sear.  The combination of the saltiness from the duck confit and the bomb-dot-com Brussels sprouts were to die for - I never thought in a million years that Brussels sprouts could taste this darn good.\\n\\nNeptune is packed at all hours of the day, and they do not take call ahead reservations. However, a good tip?  Go in, leave your name, party size, and cell phone number.  They'll call you whenever they have a table (or bar space) available, allowing you to roam around and explore the entire North End.  \\n\\nExpect to pay a pretty penny (they accept cash and credit) and don't expect to have much room between you and the person sitting next to you; they make sure to use up every seat.

The waitress (who's service was also subpar on multiple levels) had said since she consumed the beverage, she would have to be charged for it. While I will acknowledge this point is valid, she did consume the bottle, my visiting guest had pointed to the $5.95 draft on the menu and was a foreign guest. If there was any question on the opposite end, this point should have been confirmed by the waitress (it is typical to ask glass or bottle, especially when there is a 4x price difference).  \\n\\nOverall - HORRIBLE experience.

I call it Sysco frozen burgers. I never would have chosen Boston Pizza as a restaurant to visit because of this. But today it all seemed different. The restaurant still seemed dead but the food was awesome. Fresh, crisp and tasty. Even the fries all seemed to be 5 inches long instead of crappy ends from a potato chopped sideways. I was impressed this time and will plan to visit BP again. Nice job. Now you need to spread the word that things have changed because you weren't so good before. IMHO. Nice to see some local beers on tap too."},{"name":"Mary's Cafe","address":"3209 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute place. This makes me think about \\"All About Mary\\" because pictures in the wall were all about the different Mary that we know about in pop culture. \\n\\nNevertheless, this place has great reviews and seems to be the spot for Belgium-style Liege waffles. I came for breakfast so I had a Hyde Park croissant sandwich which has fried egg, tomato, while subbing ham for avocado. Honestly, It was tasty and came with a thin sliver of a watermelon on the side (cute) but the portion was very small. It would not be enough to order one dish here per person. \\n\\nSo onward to the waffles, which I chose blueberry and banana toppings.  I felt they also were using not a lot of their fruits for the toppings since it looked as if they used only a third of a banana and some blueberries. So I'm not entirely convinced if this place would give a good value for the money unless if you want to think that the extra costs are going to employees' hopefully living wages. \\n\\nHowever, the dough for the waffle was definitely unique and the shining star here - it has a yeasty and a delicious earthy and savory taste to it that gives it a nice balance to the sweet toppings on hand here, instead of allowing for the sweetness of waffles to be overdone like in many other places. I would be happy to eat these waffles anytime."},{"name":"DEE DEE","address":"4204 Manchaca Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Soo yummy! The food had so much flavor and was super fresh!

When the six of us arrived, we were told our party couldn't wear hats. A person in our party had a hat that was a leather hat from London and worth a pretty penny. They said \\"this is a resort\\" and that was the reasoning. Yet they were ok with people in flip flops, teens in volleyball spandex, and tank tops... They also didn't offer a hat check. When we were sat, we counted two people in baseball caps all sitting in the same area as us. \\nWe waited 10 minutes for a waiter. They did not ask us for a drink order. They provided a gluten free menu and recommendations, and put in a bread order for the one GF person in the group. \\nWhen they came back we ordered appetizers and had to initiate drink orders on our own. \\nWe ordered calamari, prosciutto, and rice balls. Calamari was rubbery. Rice balls average and proscuitto/melon quite good. All appetizers came out with regular bread as the GF bread still hadn't arrived. Also, they brought out all the drinks but one. So they had to be reminded of it. And when the Pinot Grigio arrived, it was warm - unlike the gluten free bread which was still frozen. So we had to flag down the waiter again and return the GF bread. The GF bread did come out hot eventually but it is dry and flat. \\nWe ordered the tortellini, salmon, veal, GF penne frutti de mare, linguini with clams, and penne with ricotta. \\nFood arrived and had clearly clearly clearly been sitting and baking under a heat lamp. The white wine sauce in the linguini and GF penne frutta de mare were broken, super oily and just generally gross tasting. The GF penne also clearly had pre-frozen \\"frutta de mare\\" - smallest scallops ever, rubbery calamari and shrimp, and tiny clams. And super small seafood portions. We had to cover the food in cheese to make it edible. The GF penne was not eaten which was mine and sucks because I was starving. \\nThe tortellini's sauce had sunken to the bottom of the bowl by the time it got to us so it needed to be mixed. The salmon and the veal were rubbery and had uneventful seasoning. And the penne with ricotta had no ricotta and looked extremely sunburnt from sitting in the heat lamp too long. Generally the food was a crappy two-star Olive Garden level of taste. \\nWe were not offered additional drinks while our glasses were empty. Our dirty plates sat on the table with is clearly done with food for about 10 minutes before the water waiter checked in on us and cleared plates. In that timeframe my husband who ate the veal had to bolt to the bathroom because his stomach had to immediately expel his meal. He came back only to have to leave immediately and go back to the restroom. \\nThe water waiter offered us dessert because our waiter never came back. We all collectively said no and wanted to get the hell out of there. \\nThey then added gratuity automatically. \\nWe are now in the Saratoga Springs cafeteria to finish our meals. \\nIn the end, we would not recommend spending your money or time here. Go to downtown Disney Springs or the Four Seasons instead."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food but the wait times can be excessive sometimes.

We had the chicken bowl (delicious, boneless, perfectly seasoned and crispy chicken with a sample of fried sides), and a side order of ribs, plus corn fritters, mac & cheese and hush puppies.  We had ordered biscuits, but unfortunately they never came, so I was given a refund by DoorDash for those. \\nI know what you're wondering. Yes...we somehow survived! My arteries were so clogged (with golden fried goodness) that as my heart attempted to pump blood, the most it could do was sputter a measly \\"piffffff\\" as one single drop passed through...but, man, it was worth it! The portions were okay, except for the large mac & cheese...but we'll get to that in a few. Again, the fried chicken was great, as were the sides that came with it.  We also had the baby back ribs (sweet, not spicy).  They were very tender and very well seasoned.  A little pricey for a side portion (small 3-4 rib slab for about $7+), but I wanted ribs tonight and ribs were delivered! I don't often crave ribs, but if I do, I know now where to turn from now on! :-) Deeeeelicious! \\nThe only disappointment (aside from the missing biscuits) was the mac & cheese. I was hoping for a rich, traditional baked mac & cheese that you find at many local BBQ and soul food joints. Instead, we  paid about $8 for a small plastic container of elbow pasta in a salty processed and nearly nacho tasting cheese sauce. I thought perhaps the saltiness came from the tear I shed at first bite, but, alas...it was the bright yellow \\"cheese\\" ocean that the pasta was drowning in.  Typically, I judge soul food places by their mac & cheese. This was an EPIC fail... but the rest of the food was so good that I will make an exception!  I would have expected a little more based on the taste and care put into the rest of the menu. Perhaps a beautifully cheesy, rich and creamy mac & cheese with real cheddar and a golden baked crust would have been the straw on the camel's back that would have made me keel over into my grave tonight... so perhaps it's for the better. God works in mysterious ways. Either way, I definitely would order again for the fried chicken and baby back ribs! Yum!\\nSorry. No pics.

Once I got a dismissive \\"We can't ice your drink because it's just not made that way\\" for my drink order.  RUDE.  Funny because they make iced tea lattes at every other freaking cafe!  Unceremoniously told off with no apology and no suggestions of an alternative drink. However, I've had very nice service, too, so service gets 2.5 stars.  \\n\\nThe awesome Allston Sunrise breakfast sandwich is a must! Is it the buttery avocado or the spicy sriracha mayo or the crispy bacon that makes this egg sandwich so damn good? It could be peppered with crack. I love it. It's also very reasonably priced. A great go to and my fave hangover food. 5 stars.\\n\\nDrinks are fine - I'm a fan of the ginger lemon tea - iced. Their summer menu has a honey lavender latte, but for me there was a huge minus with this drink.  While delicious, they didn't have a decaf option! First place I've encountered where decaf lattes are not an option! From country bumpkin cafes to big chains I'm always able to order it.  What the heck Refuge! Their breakfast burrito is boring and pricier than my tried and true Allston Sunrise. \\n\\nThe space itself can be pretty noisy so it's not the best place to come for a catch up date or to study.

It's much more affordable and tastier BUT pho nam is not a bad option especially if you're at Krog. You're paying for the location and the ambience at this place. You can't expect their prices to be as cheap as other restaurants on Buford...just not realistic.

Would I wait 2 hours again?  Probably not.  Food was great and I am glad I have been there but not good enough to make me wait 2 hours to eat it again.

Food was always good and fresh, friendly service and atmosphere. Came to the new location on a Thursday night, wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. The set up of the new restaurant is still spacious with large party rooms and tables. \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was the change in menu. The new location has taken away about half of its original menu. I was a little disappointed because they had some really unique and traditional Japanese dishes, not to mention the selection of BBQ.  Luckily the quality of food was still good, fish still fresh, service still friendly. Although I felt like some dishes are now smaller in portion size. \\n\\nDid I mention they have a one of the fullest bar in any Japanese restaurant downtown. There are also tvs by the bar if you choose to sit at the sushi bar and enjoy a sports game. Price point is higher than your average joint, but quality is definitely better. The four star is based on the quality of the food and service.\\n\\nI will still come back , but nothing will replace the old restaurant in my heart."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love the food here!

Far too many people are afraid to deter from their habitual paths and I suspect many newcomers experience similar slow starts due to the infamous nature of that area for BC's best ramen. \\n\\nRamen Man impressed. A simpler menu to choose from with three ramen soup/stew broths to choose from. \\n\\nI went with a noodle-free (paleo hack, here) pork stew with an extra order of chicken topped with two spinach sides to round everything out. The stew base was rich and creamy. You could taste the depth of the broth turned stew, seasoned perfectly. \\n\\nMy lady had the regular chicken ramen with similar results. A rich and well seasoned broth foaming with chicken goodness. The noodles - from her review - were of the same standard of any of the high end Robson ramen joints. \\n\\nThe only positive criticism I have is to improve ventilation. There was a slightly \\"off\\" smell upon arriving that is not uncommon for many establishments in the West End. Those that adjust their ventilation tend to minimize this. Again - this is NOT unique to The Ramen Man and a suggestion from a satisfied customer. \\n\\nI would not shy away from Ramen Man and I would encourage you to try it.

We ordered a bottle of wine for our meal. Our Bartender Leah (spelling might be wrong) was very personal and had a smile at all times. She did a wonderful job while still helping the table bartender with glasses.We started with the Duck Confit risotto. Which was rich in complex flavors and mushrooms to die for. Great value for the amount of work that needs to be put into it. \\n\\nI had the Icelandic Cod and my wife had the Dried aged  Rib Eye.special. She said hers was very tasty, Mine was one of those meals you dream of having when you go out for a good meal. I was shocked at how good it was. it was put on my top 10 entrees after two bites. The mussels  and cod were cooked perfect. The oysters that they add to this dish were a wonderful surprise. On the bottom of the dish were two thin slices of bread that sucked up some of the complex tomato based sauce. Even the tomatoes and zucchini had such wonderful flavor.I would save some of the begat that they give you before your meal to such more of the sauce. \\n\\nWe finished with the dark chocolate cake with port. I would like to see a ice wine added to the menu and some french pastry but its not my restaurant. \\n\\nOn the way out we meet the General Manager Mike and told him how good it was. We told him we were a little worried to try the Gaslight after reading the yelp reviews.  He admitted that they had some glitches they had to work out in the beginning. After what we were served i would say they did very well at fixing them. I believe that people yelping on everything and everything they do or eat seem to just like their words out there for the world to see. I also believe they don't understand the work that went into the food that was prepared or complex flavor they put into this food.

The light sear on the top really brought out the   salmon's flavor while there's still plenty of raw fish inside the rice to keep everyone satisfied. The jalapeno added an extra kick that kept each piece exciting and wonderful to eat.\\n - Crab Oshi Sushi was just as good. The crab is cooked of course, so don't expect raw fish or anything. But the seared buttery sauce on top of the plentiful crab inside the sushi is a guaranteed success in your mouth.\\n\\nNot only did Tsuki top food expectations, but the staff there was so friendly and welcoming. They encouraged us to feel free to stay and drink tea for as long as we'd like after finishing our food, and they even made sure our cups were full the entire time. As tourists, we asked the staff what they recommended we do around the area and one of the waitresses, Sunny, went above and beyond by giving us a list of her favorite places and wrote them all down for us before we left. \\n\\nSo after we checked everything we could off of Sunny's list, we came back to Tsuki for round two just for the delicious Oshi sushi and to see the wonderful staff again. The second visit was better than the first as one of the waitresses recognized us immediately and walked away laughing to tell the rest that we had come back for the second time. We ordered the same things of course, both as good or better as the first time, and had great conversations with the staff once again. \\n\\nTsuki is great.

That mind blowing and deep art film I saw in 1975 was kind of ponderous and predictable when I got it from Netflix recently. That barbecue at Redbones...\\n\\nI've been coming to Redbones on and off since it first opened. Wow! Was it ever really that good? Was it really so unexceptional last night? Is this a restaurant review, or a treatment for a new ponderous and predictable art film?\\n\\nWe arrived at a little after 7 on a Thursday night. We were told that a table for 3 would be a 20 minute wait. 20 minutes? What? Is the economy that bad or has something gone a little wrong here? I expected to wait an hour in an uncomfortably crowded bar. Walked in downstairs and found multiple open seats and were served immediately. Before my friend and I finished our hefeweizen (8.50), we were seated upstairs. (Listen: I'm not complaining. This was all wonderful and comfortable and totaslly unexpected, but kind of got me wondering about where the crowd was...)\\n\\nSo, here comes the cornbread. Not hot... just a little warm. Not a crunchy top, no sign of corn kernels, no sign of corn mealiness... just kind of doughy, nondescript, low in flavor stuff that butter didn't bring back to life. I said to my friends \\"Well, this ain't worth writing home about,\\" and they agreed. Not what I remembered at all, and really not worth eating.\\n\\nNext up: Buffalo wings and corn fritters. Wings: Meaty yes, crispy, no, certainly not. Hot and flavorful? Hardly. Didn't break a sweat. Didn't even need to reach for the rest of my beer. Didn't need a wet nap. Really, not worth eating. Corn fritters were OK, but somehow not as good as I remembered. They were under fried, or something. While I can't put my finger on it, the word that comes to mind is \\"homogenized.\\" They were missing that hand made, fresh corn kernel and bursting with flavor essence... I guess the other word is \\"bland.\\" When the main meal was served, there was still a fritter in the bowl. Unheard of. My friend said, \\"I'm gonna eat this if no one else wants it.\\" No one else wanted it. THAT pretty much says it all: when these fritters were good, people got bloody fork wounds on their hands if they got too close to the plate.\\n\\nNext up, the Barbecue Belt (18.50) and a pint of Pabst Blue Ribbon (2.62). The PBR was great!\\n\\nThe Belt? Eh. The brisket was not what I've seen elsewhere, nor remember from here: it was of a chunk of meat instead of tender slices. It was utterly lacking in sauce. Although tender and nicely seasoned, it had no hint of smokiness whatsoever. It made me glad that I did not order it as my entree. I anticipated that the ribs would be better. Yeah, they were. They were... OK. Not one of them made me close my eyes and say \\"Mmmm.\\" Not like the old days. Yeah, I ate it. Almost all of it. So what? I was hungry. That wasn't the point.\\n\\nNeither of my dinner companions had much, if anything, to say about the meal as we ate. On this, my memory is 100% crystal clear: when Redbones was Redbones, you talked about the food while you ate it. You raved about the food. You got giddy. You looked at the stuff that you didn't order that was going to other peoples' tables and you leaned towards it and tried to smell it as it went by. Sometimes it looked so good you just ordered some in the middle of the meal. Everyone ate until they couldn't.\\n\\nThe beans and slaw were probably the worst and beans and/or slaw I've ever had. One forkful of slaw was enough. The beans, on the other hand, I picked at throughout the dinner. My mind kept telling me they couldn't be that flavorless and disappointing and that I should just try them again. Stupid mind. My tongue was right the first time.\\n\\nFriends, I came here to praise Redbones, not to bury it, but something happened on the way to the forum."},{"name":"Ceili's Modern Irish Pub","address":"1774 W 7th Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"A friend of mine and I stopped in at Ceili's last Thursday night for a bite to eat before our movie at Fifth Avenue Cinemas.  We arrived at 5pm and we both ordered the classic dish- Beef and Barley Soup.  My friend also ordered a spicy Caesar, and I ordered an Irish Creme Coffee. \\n\\nOur drinks came right away, but my friend had to ask for the Tabasco sauce as it wasn't spicy at all, and I did wonder why a $6.50 kahlua-baileys coffee wouldn't come with whipped cream or any other topping- especially when I had told them they could skip the kahlua in it.\\n\\nThe soup didn't come until 5:20pm but we could see that the reason for the slow service was because there was only our one waitress on despite the pub being almost half full.  The soup was extremely salty, and was clearly poor quality canned Beef and Barley Soup.  We also noticed right away that there was no beef in either of our soups- I was only able to find one tiny, hard 7mm by 7mm cube of 'beef'.  We asked the waitress if there was supposed to be, or if it was just beef broth.  Ten minutes later, at 5:35pm she returned with two small dishes, apparently for us to add more beef (she went and scraped the bottom of the soup pot for us).  I suppose there wasn't any beef down there at the bottom of the pot in the kitchen, because one of the small dishes just contained more barley, and the other dish contained three little bits of beef- all smaller than the one I had been able to find in my own soup.\\n\\nAt that point I gave both of the small dishes to my friend to 'fortify' his soup, and asked to return mine and replace it with the rib bites as I figured that would be quick and fill my stomach before the movie.  I received the rib bites at almost 6pm and I ate as many of them as I could before having to leave at 6:20pm for our movie.\\n\\nThe waitress was nice and none of the situation between slow service (short staffed) or quality of food (beyond her control) was her fault at all.  This bad review is targeted at whoever is managing the place and the food.  \\n\\nTo Ceili's: You are an irish pub.  On one hand, I feel the need to ask why the traditional irish lamb stew wasn't on the menu, but instead I'll just focus on saying- if you're going to offer Beef and Barley soup it had better darn well be hearty like all irish fare.  Money is a poor excuse to start cutting corners by going with store-bought food and cutting back your staff so that the service level can't be maintained.  This will drive your customers away and exacerbate the situation.  If I had been served an amazing soup, you'd be having an excellent review right now- telling the masses that I had a great experience and that maybe things are better.  There's still time to turn the ship around, it's an Irish Pub and people will always come once.  It's whether they ever come back again, that's up to you."},{"name":"China Moon","address":"525 South Ronald Reagan Blvd, Ste 145","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"I have never seen such a clean Chinese food take out spot.

I tried:\\n\\nWellfleet\\nIsland Creek\\nKatama Bay (MAD salty initial taste)\\nOnset\\nRiptide\\nSummerside\\nKumamoto - very crisp and refreshing, tasted noticeably different from the other oysters.\\nKusshi - nice cucumber finish!\\nLittleneck Clams - had a pleasant, mildly chewy texture and great flavor.\\n\\nAmongst my group, we also ordered:\\n\\nFried Ipswich Clams - terribly disappointing unfortunately.  I could hardly taste the clams amidst the copious amounts of batter.  Paired with the tartar sauce, it really didn't taste much different from fried fare one would have from places like Long John Silver's.  Total waste of $19.\\n\\nNeptunes on Piggyback - a very interesting combination of golden raisins, fried oysters, and shredded pork.  Though I wasn't blown away, it was quite tasty and the flavors and textures of each ingredient melded very nicely.\\n\\nYellowtail Hamachi Tartare - Delightfully refreshing fish that matched well with the kimchi.  The flavor of the mint kimchi was surprisingly moderate and didn't overpower the hamachi at all.\\n\\nSeared Georges Bank Scallops - The highlight of the evening, the scallops were absolutely AMAZING and easily the best I've had thus far.  The outer seared layer was thin and crisp and the inside was so velvety smooth it was simply unbelievable.  Highly recommended!\\n\\nNeptuneburger - Solid burger with quality ground beef considering it was ordered well-done.  Not much of a burger person myself, but it was still one of the better ones I've tried.\\n\\nCod (Special of the day) - Okay flavor, but I was rather unimpressed with the texture as it was very grainy.  My friend really didn't enjoy it and thought it was sour, so yeah...go figure.\\n\\nAs for drinks, I had the 2008 Pazo Senorans Albarino and the Chenin Blanc (couldn't get the winery and year, sadly) and enjoyed both.  The former had a great, lightly sweet finish and the latter matched exceptionally well with the seafood.  \\n\\nAs much as I want to give them 5 stars, I gotta drop it down to 4 with the seriously lackluster fried clams and cod.

Sure enough, my order had somehow gotten lost, and by that time, all the nutella cream puffs had flown off the shelves.  That had been the one of the three that I most wanted to try.  Pretty devastating.  When I told the guy, he was just like... oh, sorry.  Could you choose something else?  I settled for a vanilla bean.  Overall: the doughnuts? Fine.  I've definitely had better.  Orange pistachio was very good.  Would get that again.  Would I come back?  Sure, if I was very close by, but I wouldn't go out of my way (at least for the ones I had.)  The nutella cream puff?

When we come on a Friday or Saturday night there can be a wait for a table. \\n\\nNow for the food. They serve the best shrimp and grits I have had locally. The grits are cooked perfectly creamy and served with a wine sauce. I could eat it everyday (*sigh). You just have to try it. They also serve an amazing gumbo, whether it is seafood or the chicken and sausage gumbo. And then there is red beans and rice, po boys, bread, and when you get to dessert, their beignets are life-changing. I do not order dessert at most restaurants, but we always do 100% of the time here. You leave with sugar dusted fingers and mouths. \\n\\nIf you're of drinking age, you can have one of the famous hurricanes or a glass of purple haze in a frosted goblet. Either one does the trick.

There are lots of things you can excuse when a place is busy...  The awkward wait at the door where you debate yourself when nobody comes over for an extended period on whether or not it's seat-yourself, the elbow-to-elbow cramped dining room, the slow or as it was tonight virtually no service as you sit for almost 15 minutes and nobody comes to the table.  These are things you're willing to overlook when the food is THAT GOOD.  Unfortunately for this place, it's not.  Not only is it not THAT GOOD, it's barely cracking JUST AVERAGE.  Here's the thing, the food was edible, filling, and not ridiculously expensive for downtown Boston, but one thing you should never say about pho is that it's bland.  This is bland.  The appetizers were also bland.  If it weren't for sriracha and hoisin I would have had little more than a bowl of water, noodles, and boiled meat...  Sadly, I don't think that's what anybody would expect from pho, but that's what you'll get.

They also have a little stage in the restaurant.  What they do on there who knows but definitely it gives a different vibe than your traditional breakfast joint.\\n\\nI had the corn beef hash and my friend had the works waffle.  The corn beef hash comes with their house corn beef with bell peppers, red onions and hash browns mixed in their house sauce then grilled.  It also comes with a choice of toast.  I also ordered a side of bacon which was okay.  The portion size is huge and the food was pretty good.  Not the best I had but it!s solid.  The corn beef was a bit overlooked, and I would have preferred the corn beef to be separate from the hash browns but they blended it all together and I feel it took away from the corn beef.  Having poached egged over the corn beef was awesome.  The works waffle is a Belgian waffle with warn blueberry compote with crushed hazel nuts with maple syrup.  The waffle was awesome.  Not too sweet and the blueberry compote was fresh and again not too sweet. It was perfect!  The portion size is generous as well considering how much we paid.  It's also great to get your coke in a big 32 oz glass jar.  You'll never have to ask for refills!\\n\\nOur server was okay.

Luckily for us because of this a table outside in the nice night air was readily available.\\n\\nThe food was typically Jody Adams; excellent.  We were pretty surprised that they would actually charge $5 for bread which while delicious and warm, came out in the shape of one large pretzel that everyone had to grab and rip apart.  While I'm by no means a germaphobe, I always wonder why those restaurants who offer this type of bread \\"bowl\\" do this.  You have one piece of bread that four people have to now grab, touch and rip apart.  Does someone take a larger piece?  Does someone feel bad that they're leaving too small a piece, etc. etc.  Enough w the artistic offering; just give a nice bowl of sliced bread that everyone can choose from individually and don't charge for it...\\n\\nBeyond the food, however, the service was terrible.  You never know w service as it might simply be a reflection of a waitress having a bad day, but ours was terrible.  When we asked what she thought of a specific dish (I believe it was the sea bass), or how it was prepared, she began by saying, \\"um, hmmm.  It's breaded and ....\\"  she lost me right there.

Had we not raved, due to time constraints the perennial favorite, the tumble inn diner would have been our stop.\\n\\nSo we ordered, and we quickly learned how dumb ashley was.  Liz got the chocolate chip waffles and milk, Eric got the kielbasa and grits, with cranberry juice, and me the breakfast sampler with iced coffee.    \\n\\nShe did not know what came on the sampler but showed us with her hands the approximate size, what actually came was much smaller, she did not know if the waffles came with eggs nor if my sampler had any options, she had to check with the kitchen as she claimed the weekend menu confused her.\\n\\nShe came back, said eggs did not come with the waffles but gave me a toast choice.  Made my choice, wheat.  We waited, and while we did we wrote and posted some old yelp reviews, bad sign for you 3 yolks.  Ashley you were annoying, you kept coming back, you just wanted to tell us that Eric looked soooo familiar and how you also spent some time living in CT.  Great....and its morning, we are hungry, and we don't care.  \\n\\nFood comes, eventually, and the nightmare truly begins.  Eric puts watery  katchup on his plate, definately not hunts as stated on the label, likely something cheap and canned, the hunts bottle shows an expiration date of over 2 months ago.  Liz digs into her pancakes, there are no chocolate chips and we tend to lean towards thinking they are buckwheat or whole wheat.  Excuse me we call out, Ashley explains that they are the chocolate chip pancakes, that they melt the chocolate chips into the batter.  Another bite leads us to believe her.   They could be chocolate, but still they aren't good.  She pushes them aside and picks from all our plates.  My meal far from perfect, came with scrambled eggs, I don't like scrambled eggs I like them fried or over easy, anything but scrambled.  Did I have an option? I wasn't given one.  \\n\\nAshley returns, Liz tells her to take the waffles away, two or three bites removed.   Check comes, my iced coffee is gone and I want more.  Never offered.  We spend time reading the check, considering how to properly tip with service like this.  Ashley comes back says we are spending too much time with the check wondering if anything us wrong.  We tell her no, there is stuff wrong.  1) the waffles aren't compped, and 2) she wrote down scrambled eggs by my order.  \\n\\nWe decided to comp the waffles ourselves.  Paid and promptly left.  Had you compped the waffles you would have had a tip more than thirty something cents, instead we had to.  We paid and got out ASAP, car in reverse before all the doors were even closed.

I've heard about this place and saw it the other night on Chronicle and decided that I had to give a try, because I love oysters. No one was around to go with me, so I decided to go it alone. I have no problem going to a place to eat lunch by myself, especially in the North End. You always end up talking to someone. \\n\\nBecause its not a very big place, I decided to go at about 2pm for a late lunch to miss the crowds. However, because of all its recent publicity, in The Boston Globe, Chronicle and soon the TV Food Network, I did have to wait about 10 minutes, but it wasn't a bad wait at all.While line, I ended up talking with two very nice women, a mother and daughter who were in Boston for a day trip and and older couple. All at the same time a table and three seats at the bar opened, so the older couple took the table and myself and the other two ladies in line sat together at the bar. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself looks like something out of the 40's. White tile, dark wood, old style fixtures etc. Very nice, comfortable feel to it. Clean, but not cold. \\n\\nThey have a wide variety of oysters to choose from. I really liked how they give you a list with the name of the oyster, origin, the price of each, their size and accurate taste description of each oyster. You just go down the list and put a the number of oysters you want next to its name. Its almost a cross between a sushi order sheet and a wine list. \\n\\nI wanted to compare several different varieties of oysters, because I compare all to the Welfleet oyster. I was raised on those. So I ordered a few Welfleet, a few Katama bay, Kumamoto- from WA, and a Pemaquid from ME and a few cherrystones for good measure. \\nI have to say that the description given on their order sheet is very accurate. For example, they describe the Kumamoto oyster as \\"Sm. sweet, plump, creamy, with hints of honeydew melon.\\" Yeah I know, honeydew melon?! Well I'll be danmed! It did have a honeydew tasting finish on it! LOL! Unreal \\n\\nThe ladies next to me had Neptune's famous hot buttered lobster roll and it looked great! They were both very pleased with it. If you have eat a lobster roll with a knife and fork- isn't really a bad things. Lots of glistening buttered lobster meat in a beautifully buttery toasted roll. \\n\\nThey were great company as well. Thank ladies!\\n\\nI would have like to have tried their clam chowder, but they only offer it by the bowl. I  couldn't have finished a whole bowl. I would have liked just a cup with my raw bar treats, That would have been perfect.\\n\\n I also think they should give that poor bartender a raise or little extra help now thru the holidays. She was slammed. No one just drinks at this bar. She was the bartender, server, cashier, informant, buser, etc and she handled it all very well and with grace, but if that were me I  would have told the owner if he left me out to dry like that again I would quit. But again, she never complained, just apologized for any wait and just kept moving right along. She was like a machine.\\n\\nAlso BONUS for pulling the Guinness in three pours. \\n\\nEverything is done right here. \\n\\nCan't wait to go back!

The whole dish was bland and the potatoes tasted old and greasy and way too big a portion of them. This meal was not something we would ever want to repeat. We cook much much much better at home.

Every time it was just as good as our first experience.  One caveat - if going for the crab, only go on Sunday when the place is packed.  When it's crowded, the fresh pans of deep fried blue crab come out constantly . . . .during the week (evenings) when it's less crowded, the pans come out much more infrequently so you either have to wait a long time for the next batch or settle for crab that has been sitting in the pan for a long time and just isn't as good as the hot, freshly dumped batch.  By the way, everything else we have tried on this buffet is also excellent, especially the sashimi and the ribs.  Service is always excellent and very, very attentive.

My favorite is their pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. Their ribs are pretty wide ranging in their styles and the way that they're made (Memphis-style, Texas red meat, you name it they pretty much have it). They're jerked chicken is also fantastic if you're into spicy food, just make sure you have a full drink near you.\\n\\nTheir beer list also is pretty impressive; the bar upstairs has all the typical offerings along with a crazy variety of craft brews that I had never heard of before. \\n\\nAnother nice thing is that it's not incredibly expensive for a dinner out; you can usually get out of there for around $25 (for the amount of food you get, trust me its a good deal).
