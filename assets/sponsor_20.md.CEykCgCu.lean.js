We could hardly keep the ball in play before the game was over. My friend, who is well-versed in these matters, pointed out the extreme angle of the tables with the leveling screws on the back feet of the machines extended to maximum height. This is a tactic to drain as much money from your patrons as fast as possible and cycle people through with limited play times. We were disgusted.

Read reviews of this place through Yelp and the pictures of the Tamago Nigiri SOLD ME! \\n\\nThe restaurant is located in the shopping plaza nearby Golden Lotus on Sand lake / John Young pkwy - Right nearby 7eleven gas station.\\n\\nThe restaurant is small but comfortable. Bathroom is clean and the soap dispenser is actually soap not watered soap (pet peeve). \\n\\nThe staff here wear genuine japanese kimonos and japanese slippers. And they ARE JAPANESE! I can detect who are Chinese, Koreans, Japanese because I have been around them through years growing up.\\n\\nThe menu they give you is about 3 pcs - Sushi Bar menu, Main Menu and Alcohol Menu. I targeted the sushi bar with 5 ORDERS OF EGG NIGIRI aka TAMAGO NIGIRI. ( see pics ) -- then looking through the main menu The prices are slight cheaper than Hanamizuki (My other favorite authentic japanese restaurant in I-drive) - stopped going there because the prices went up and they stopped serving $12 lunch bento trays (sad face). \\n\\nThe menu has array selection of udon soups, ramen soup, japanese curry and rice bowls. Also appetizers and dinner combo that is a combination of sushi/sashimi pieces with either tempura or teriyaki servings. \\n\\nThe water here is cold and tastes clean which is a plus for me as a diner. Lets talk about service; they are nice and excellent with water service and picking up dirty plates afterwards of eating. \\n\\nThe only complaint I had was when the 5 pcs of tamago was placed one of the staff made a surprise reaction within their language. Kind of rude to react to a diner's order imo. Also you feel as a diner you are being watched as you eat because this place is small. The place got kinda busy but not crowded so when I was almost done with my meal my water glass was empty and it took them a few to refill my glass. Other than that service was not bad.\\n\\nThe food; ORDER THE EGG NIGIRI aka Tamago Nigiri! The tamago is authentic it tastes sweet and savory egg rolled omelet. It is THE BEST BY FAR imo. You can tell they make theirs in the house not the ones you can tell is freezer bought or lack of authenticity when they make Tamago. The layers of this rolled omelet looks amazing and the taste is SUPERB! I can eat 20pcs!!! That is one of the items I will surely come back and order more of -- maybe 20 pieces? Lol\\n\\nThe Agedashi Tofu is good as well the batter was not as crispy as what I had before but the pieces is worth it for the price! The broth is good a tad bit salty to my liking but it was good! I would order this again because the price and the pieces are reasonable! \\n\\nThe Nabeyaki Udon was delicious however I think Hanamizuki's version had more Toppings in their soup than Sushi Tomi's version. The soup however was delicious served in a covered clay pot - the server uncovers the claypot in front of you as you see steam coming out when it is uncovered. The soggy tempura pieces turned me off a bit - Next time I will request Tempura pieces on the side. The tempura pieces is suppose to be served in the soup but the soggy batter is not delightful to see imo. The toppings in this included Tempura shrimp,Tempura white fish,Chicken chunks, sliced fish cakes - I didnt see any vegetables which I was expecting. \\n\\nI will def come back and try the ramen soup and of course their famous EGG NIGIRI! Just thinking about that Nigiri makes my mouth water!! Love love love that tamago!! \\n\\nI just wished they made Bento Lunches (similar to Hanamizuki) for a fair price. Love eating in a tray with small dishes of a variety of foods. Its truly a japanese experience when you eat this way imo."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We had been to the original location of Musashino off Mopac a few years ago and loved it, so we were excited to check out this location on Friday night when folks were in town to babysit.\\n\\nWe got sat right away, and while the ambience/decor is nice, the acoustics are terrible. Our server asked about drinks about a second after we sat down, and when we said we needed a minute, she took 10, and that was annoying. We were excited that they have one of our favorite beers on tap (the Hitachino Nest white ale), so we got one of those and the Ginger 75 to start, along with the seaweed salad and a house salad. The former was nice enough, but the latter had too thick of a dressing on it and came with exactly one half slice of cucumber :(\\n\\nBut sushi. Ooooh dat sushi! It really is so good. We got the Elvis roll, the Black Widow, and the South Sider with yellowtail. The Black Widow was both of our favorites: spice, squid ink rice, tender fish, jalape√±o dipping sauce. Sushi heaven. Both of the other rolls were good, but the only other highlight of the meal was the fatty smoked toro that we got. Treat yoself when there's free babysitting!\\n\\nDessert was a major, major disappointment and a terrible way to round out dinner.

Ewwwww! Like for real? My child can make pancakes!!!! He took them back again & she said some lame excuse about them changing batter every month & a learning curve...blah, blah...like FR? It's pancake batter! Fry then flip!!!! So at this point we were annoyed. The made to order taco bar shuts down at 3....which no one told us it closes early. The buffet kept running out of things and they would say they not bringing anymore out. ***sigh*** ummmm chela is a big NO for all 10 of us there. We were underwhelmed & it wasn't worth the price!

You need Canada.\\" Another number which sent me to Canada delivery and Assembly.  5 more minutes.  They said \\"Oh this is just delivery and assembly.

It's been some years since it was sold. They immediately dropped some of the unique and high quality bakery goods they were known for. Then they altered some basics with cheaper ingredients. Gone are the quality fresh walnuts they used, replaced by dry, bland nut crumbs. But sometime last year, I was even more disappointed to find even their house recipe cinnamon roll lacking. Thinking maybe it was a singular failure and finding so many new cafes and bread product purveyors cropping up nearby, I waited to try again at a later date. Sad to report that did not help and I probably won't be back. Hard, dry, not risen enough and under baked again, reduced cinnamon flavor but excess dry brown sugar on top and wrapped in the weirdest smelling plastic wrap. This is not what Scott's and Sally's reputation was built on when they founded this store decades ago. \\n\\nMaybe it's doing ok on its sandwich shop service or its basic breads, but on its unique baked dessert recipes for brownies and cookies, rolls and muffins, now just a lost part of Boulder's culinary history.

Parking was convenient."},{"name":"Bancroft & Co","address":"210 Andover St","city":"Peabody","stars":"3.5","text":"A few minor but important details denied Bancroft & Co. the fifth star in what will otherwise be a glowing review. So let's quickly dispense with them.\\n1. The hostesses last Saturday night were lovely, but green and unhelpful. To wit, we arrived an hour before our 8 p.m. reservation, intending to sit at the bar and enjoy some oysters, but the bar was packed. Understandable, and a testament to its popularity. The hostess explained there weren't two seats available, but we were welcome to stand at a counter, which was fine. That was it.\\n\\nBut then two seats opened up, so I grabbed them and waved my wife over. Then the bartender asked if the hostess had seated us, and we explained she never mentioned there being a wait list for the bar. He politely explained he couldn't serve us, then, so we returned to the hostess and asked about it. She didn't really reply, but checked, then walked us back to those same seats, where the same bartender served us (and served us well). \\n\\n2. Rather than the hostess informing us when our table was ready, we had to keep track of the time, then abandon the bar when we saw it was time for our reservation and return to the hostess station. We did this, but our table wasn't ready for another 10 minutes, owing to some (understandably) lingering previous diners. Not a big deal, but a bit of an inconvenience for customers who could be drinking at leisure until their table was ready, rather than cooling their heels in the entryway.\\n\\n3. I ordered the steak au poivre cooked medium. It came out on the rarer side of medium rare (though the ends were medium). But ...\\n\\nMAN was that ever a great steak! It was generously crusted with fresh ground pepper or minced peppercorns, charred to perfection. \\n\\nThe wife ordered the rigatoni bolognese, which was delightfully smoky and festooned with just the right amount of sauce. \\n\\nShared sides were the rosemary french fries (delicious, but many restaurants are doing them these days) and polenta, which was creamy and flavorful. (In my mind, I was thinking of risotto, and was briefly confounded when the polenta came out -- my brain cramp. This side was just fine, especially when I dipped slices of the steak into it.)\\n\\nAppetizers: wife had the clam chowder, which she enjoyed. I had the stuffed clams (three in the portion) which were good, though nothing special, especially in comparison to the entrees and the aforementioned oysters, which were perfectly shucked (no grit or shell fragments at all) and presented with a (perhaps too subtle) clear brine. Really a wonderful way to start things off.\\n\\nThe room is elegant, though not stuffy (kind of business casual, though you'll see some gents in ball caps and shorts, which: where were their fathers? Staff are universally attractive and service (except for the green hostesses) was top-notch all the way around. Our waitress, Kat, was exceptional. Lovely and no-nonsense, she was preternaturally right there when we needed another drink at our table, which looked out on the busy mall parking lot and passing pedestrians. At night, a more-pleasant-than-expected view. \\n\\nThe seats are large, well padded and comfortable, with a few ornate touches (a handle that looks like an old door-knocker, for instance). Same is true at the bar, which I recall is marble and surrounded by similarly capacious and comfortable bar stools. A stately vibe. \\n\\nPrice: well, you get what you pay for. Our stay at the bar came to $98 before tip for a dozen oysters and drinks (3 Bulleit bourbons and 2 rose wines). The dinner before tip was about $165 (3 more Bulleits -- we weren't driving! -- 1 more rose; 2 entrees; 2 appetizers; 1 after-dinner cappuccino).\\n\\nIt ain't cheap, but Bancroft & Co. offers some wonderful food and service and an elegant night out.

The pancake is fried to perfection, crispy, rather large in size (hence it being $10) and has a good amount of seafood in it (there is a Kimchi option as well); it is served with a nice soy sauce based dipping sauce but I recommend eating it with spicy mayo. For my entree I order the Bulgogi beef, it came with ginger salad, miso soup, white rice, steamed broccoli, a little bit of kimchi, warm bean sprout and potato salad. The beef was good, the sauce had a nice sweetness to it; I really enjoyed the small portion of potato salad and bean sprouts. My friend ordered the Philly sushi role, which was nice and the Chicken Katsu, which was fine but it barely had any sauce.

The mussels with chorizo were rich in flavor. The mussels were plump and delicate, but I thought the sauce was overly buttery. You could tell that the entire sauce was essentially melted butter rather than just used as a thickener to finish off the natural steaming liquid from the mussels. We shared a 16 oz. rib eye which is why it came pre-cut (a little odd to me), and it cost $40. The steak was nicely seasoned with course black pepper and salt, slightly overcooked but not chewy; we asked for medium.

After seeing it on a  tv, it looked like a really nice place to go with beautifully made tables and excellent bbq.  I almost never get to enjoy bbq because most use soy sauce or beer or something I am allergic to in their sauces, but my mouth was watering, so I called.\\n\\nWhen I asked if anything on their menu was gluten-free, they said they had a gluten-free menu and I could eat all their meats and sauces and listed the sides including the s&p potatoes (deep fried).  I asked if they were deep fried in the same oil as breaded items and she assured me they kept a separate fryer from the breaded food for the salt and pepper potatoes so I could even have those.  She said they were really good about dealing with gluten.  I was  psyched!\\nSo, after standing on concrete flooring for an hour waiting for a table with a noise level that was unbearable, I found what I thought was a comfortable, beautiful restaurant we saw on tv was really a cold, loud assault on the senses with food that was disappointing.\\n\\nAnd, after going through the drill with the waiter about cross-contamination of food and being so sensitive, I was assured several times it was safe to eat the potatoes, that they took allergies very seriously.... I asked him to just confirm everything with the kitchen and come to find out that they were putting breaded stuff in the fryer and I could not have the potatoes. It was a bummer, but no biggie, I was glad he really checked and illness was avoided.  So, what happens next? they serve me the gluten-free potato salad and as I take a big bite of the bacon-bit-covered potato salad, it was obvious from the crunch level of the bacon that it was deep fried.  To be safe, I asked the waiter to confirm that it was not fried with the breaded stuff and what do you know, it was.   My dinner was ruined and they did not even offer to buy me a glass of wine or dessert or anything, just repeated empty apologies from the waiter.  \\n\\nApparently they take it so seriously that when they screw up, they don't even tell a manager or do any damage control.

The atmosphere is airy and casual, which we like, and it's nice to have a limited menu sometimes, especially coming off the heels of our trip to France. We got the croque madame and eggs benedict (switching sausage out for bacon). We were not fans of the benedict since the hollandaise was both too sour and abundant. The croque madame was better, had a well-executed mornay, and was served with a generous heap of fries. We also got our kiddo some fries, and while the portion is mighty, most of them are kinda limp. We did appreciate that their mayonnaise had horseradish in it. Salut to that.\\n\\nAnd a special shoutout to the table's order of beignets, which were warm, crisp, puffy, and drowning in powdered sugar, as they should be.

We ordered the octopus salad, grilled romaine, and a charcuterie board with meats and cheeses. My boyfriend wasn't crazy about the romaine but I felt like we needed some veggies to round out our meal. Who'd think that taking lettuce to a grill and adding some dressing to it would taste sooo good? I must try this at home. The octopus was diced up small and served on a bed of lettuce to which I made lettuce wraps out of it. That was very good, especially after doused with a squeeze of lemon. The charcuterie board had some of the best meats I've ever had: soppressata, ham, and others I can't remember their names, but trust me it's delicious. We still had a little room so we also ordered the Porchetta Spiced Pork Cheeks which was set on top of triple-cheese polenta and the Housemade Meatballs which was on top of the same type of polenta.

The fries weren't salted after they came out of the fryer (making it greasy, not crisp) and the chicken was waaaay overcooked. After our party paid our meals, we were just heading out; then one of the servers accidentally bumped into me and spilled a drink (juice or mocktail) behind me, a bit got on my jacket and my lower right side of my body, leaving my foot and right butt cheek wet and sticky(que the laughter)...\\n\\nAs compensation, the server did say sorry (which did soften my face a little bit, so it saves them from getting a -1/5 stars review, which should exist); and she gave me 1 \\"wet\\" nap to clean myself up from that drink...yes, 1 \\"wet\\" nap...in fact, the \\"wet\\" nap wasn't even wet! If anything, it should just be called  nap. Even my friends helped pat-dry my jacket with multiple table napkins instead of just one, and they don't even work there!\\n\\nMoral of the story, if you're planning to go to Boston Pizza (especially this location); don't order the grilled chicken for your salad unless you want to feed it to your dog, or anything that comes with fries. Don't t wear your favourite clothes because you are bound to get some crap on it, and the servers will probably give you 1 nap...maybe 2 naps after reading this review.\\n\\nI do not recall going out of my way to write a bad review (or any review at all), but because I just wanted a chill night with my friends; but I cannot actually enjoy it with the feeling of my right butt cheek being all wet and sticky...\\n\\nTake notes, Boston Pizza...\\nMake sure to give 2 actually wet naps instead of one.

The average person will recognize (by name) several dishes from their local Americanized Chinese joint, but Canton Cook II is arguably some of the best Cantonese food in Atlanta, and unlike most takeout places in the metro area.  \\n\\nOn our first visit we had:  spicy braised chicken wings, beef chow fun, and spicy garlic pork. \\n\\nAll three were perfectly prepared and complimented each other really well.  Pairing dishes at Chinese restaurants is half the battle.  I tend to lean spicy and/or toward brown sauces, so I avoid dishes with a white sauce.  It's not that they're bad. They just end up being bland after a sauce found in spicy garlic pork. \\n\\nSo I'd recommend two of the 3 dishes they're known for (braised wings and chow fun) as a must on your first visit.  And get the chow fun dry (not wet).   It's insanely good. Their chow fun could go up against any noodle dish at Lan Zhou Ramen. \\n\\nIf I were the chef at Lan Zhou Ramen, and I wanted a worthy opponent, I'd fight the dude at Canton Cook II.  \\n\\nWe look forward to going back as the food is incredible, it's priced affordably and their selection of fresh fish/seafood provides a nice alternative to the standard Cantonese fair most of us see at other restaurants."},{"name":"Frank's Steak House","address":"2310 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"The food tonight was disappointing, my steak had a significant amount of grizzle, the tomatoes were not really ripe in my caprese salad.

But understandably so because sushirittos could save your life. If you have to fight for it, you fight. Because let's face it, they'd do the same for you.\\n\\nAnywho...back to the restaurant. It's a nice mom and pop restaurant that is refreshingly simple. \\"Appa\\" means father in korean.\\n\\nLocation/Parking: They're right across the street from burlington and if I'm not mistaken, it was previously a korean bbq joint. The restaurant is of a good size with nice asian fusion decir. I noticed that their ceilings are just a tad bit low compared to most restaurants. I'm short so it doesn't bother me. They have a decent sized parking lot outside and it's off of buford hwy so be careful driving in and out since the hwy can get pretty busy. \\n\\nMenu/Ordering: The process is very simple. The menu is to the point and has just enough items so that you have choices but doesn't bombard you with so many that you feel like you're taking a language test halfway through. So you pick up a menu at the slot near the door and order at the counter by checking the items you want from a small list. A la carte baby. You give it to them, they ring you up, you pay, and then you grab a table where you'll wait for them to call your order. Or you could just stand to the side and wait if you're doing carryout. I ordered the sushiritto and it was already packed in a to-go box so I'm assuming that's just protocol. By the way, the sushiritto is basically what you'd get in the poke bowl...just wrapped up like a burritolol\\n\\nBreakdown of the menu:\\n\\nA. What style do you want?\\n- Poke bowl\\n- Burrito\\n- Hand roll\\n\\nB. What type of fish? salmon or tuna\\n\\nC. Spicy or Savory? (I got spicy and I honestly don't think it was spicy, but I eat spicy food on a normal basis so this is for you spicy regulars out there..it ain't spicy)\\n\\nAfter, you can choose your choice of sides and drinks and they also have a list in the back that includes appetizers and special sushi rolls. I only got the sushiritto so I can't really chime in on the other items but they seem to have really fresh ingredients so I'd imagine they'd be equally as delicious. \\n\\nThe owners were very nice as well as their employees. The service was very fast too. Shout out to Joe who was very cool and made sure our food was amazingly delicious. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come back again.

I was staying in Burlington for work and my coworker suggested we check this place out (it was on eaters mag). At first I was pretty skeptical because he's not asian and I was weary of the fact that this place also is a well known bar. However, I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nI've been here twice so far and sat at the bar. Both times we had a great experience, great bartenders and vibe. Keep in mind that the upstairs bars is only open thurs-sun and it is recommended to make reservations online at least a day ahead of time. For same day reservations, you should call in.\\n\\nHere's what I've tried:\\n\\nChong Qing Dry Hot Chicken (5/5): One of the best things on the menu, you NEED to get this. Deep fried seasoned chicken with peppers, really tasty and goes well with the fried rice. \\n\\nChengdu Chicken Wings (5/5) - AMAZING. Might seem like chicken overload to order wings as appetizer and the chongqing hot chicken as an entree but trust me its not. This comes with a spicy dipping sauce that is so freakin delicious. Love how crispy the wings are too\\n\\nPea pods with garlic (4/5) - You don't see this on the menu everywhere. Its a really light vegetable. \\n\\nBraised beef with napa cabbage (2/5) - Not very good, it was a little too soupy (way too much sauce) and the beef itself was really chewy and overcooked. Also lacked flavor, would not order again\\n\\nSichuan dumplings (4/5)  - the sauce that this comes with is really tasty and the dumplings themselves are flavorful. The only thing I would change is the fact that they are a bit heavy on the wrapper to filling ratio. Could use more pork filling. \\n\\nHouse special fried rice (4/5) - Not spectacular but still really good\\n\\nAqua Fresca (5/5) - Really refreshing, not sweet type of drink.

Such great flavor and the glaze was a perfect dipping sauce. They also give you a great monkey bread to glaze ratio so you're never left glazeless. We also got the french toast for the table. The french toast was fairly standard and nothing too out of the ordinary. It took some time for our waitress to come around again to take our actual food orders, but we understood since it was very busy. \\n\\nFor entrees, we got the Panzanella Salad, the Open Mezze Sandwich, and the Fried Chicken Sandwich.

Spacious and lovely. We need more patio dining in Vancouver. \\n\\nI have visited twice in the last two weeks. Food has all been good. Fish and chips with brussel sprouts the first time and an array of shared plates the second. The siracha tots, steak bites, flat bread and crab dip. All tasty but a bit heavy for my tastes. The flat bread was smothered in cheese as was the crab dip. The steak bites came over fries and covered in brown gravy. The brussel sprouts also came in a heavy sauce. I did not see many lighter options on the shared menu. Additions on the lighter less saucy side might be welcome. But if you want some cheesy goodness you will love it.  There were some dinner options a bit lighter but we were only wanting snacks. The bread was provided along with our snacks and was super soft and delicious. And free.  I think it was. I guess I didn't check my bill that closely. \\n\\nService was as I would expect in a hotel restaurant. Friendly and attentive.  Waters and drinks were replenished and I never felt we were waiting on anything. \\n\\nPrices on the high side. Nothing I saw on menu less than about 12. And no happy hour on the patio. Seems like downtown Portland waterfront pricing.  It was not at all crowded on a beautiful summer day. I think this place would be packed if there were some lighter less expensive menu items and happy hour available on the patio. What I have why can't we have all menu available in the entire restaurant???  I will never understand this. Also I am wondering why with the remodel they didn't just rearrange the whole place and make the bar near the patio. Seems that would have been a real money maker. As it is now hotel guests may not even be aware of the patio as the bar is right off the lobby. So likely they will stay and eat the more reasonably priced hh food and never venture out to lounge and drink the night away. \\n\\nI likely will come back but it might be saved for social occasions.

The fried green tomatoes are awesome--always juicy with a perfect crust on them. I recommend ordering the jalapeno ranch dip to eat with them. Also got the biscuits which deliver every time. For a savory/sweet combo, put the honey butter and jalapeno ranch on them---delish. Ordered the cheese dip as well which unfortunately was a huge disappointment. It was a super watery flavorless sauce that I'm sure is used for the mac and cheese normally. Would love to see an actual cheddar sauce with pickled jalape√±os or something. Trays: this time I shared a big tray of sausage (okay, very dry this time but it has been better other times; beware it's miniature size), pork belly which has never ever been bad. It's got a charred crust and is smoked to perfection. Brisket has been hit or miss-sometimes very dry, pulled pork is good as well but needs those delicious sauces that are on the table. Fried chicken was ordered once--- wasn't a fan. I know a lot of people love it but it had a weird flavor to it--almost as if something was in the brining liquid and lacked seasoning. For sides--have loved the mac and cheese, farmers salad and potato salad. Ordered the ranch beans once and they were severely undercooked and there was no ranch notes. Drinks here are great and I love a place that lets their staff actually show their personality. All the staff here have been attentive, friendly and sometimes quite hilarious.

After some hesitation, she told me I could \\"hang onto them.\\" About 20 minutes later, I arrived back at the restaurant to pick up my order and was told I was \\"all set.\\" I asked to speak to the manager about a refund. She told me I could just take the calzones and go. After I explained the price discrepancy, she continued to void my original transaction and charge me for the calzones. Rather than apologizing for the inconvenience and offering to do anything to make it right she thanked me and told me to have a nice night. My point is, there were no apologies for the inconvenience of driving home and realizing they had made a mistake and having to drive back. There were no apologies for me not getting the order I wanted or any of the mistakes they made.

I love me some Brazilian steakhouse and Rio was pretty good. The selection wasn't as vast as other places I've been, but you can't argue when servers come around with beef, steak, pork, chicken, sausage, and more. The salad bar game is a little weak at Rio, but who really goes for the salad bar. I love the fact that when you sit down, you're eating within a few minutes. Nothing worse than waiting for service and waiting for food. The portions are generous, the meat is cooked well and the flavors were great. The entertainment came out about halfway through the meal and danced, danced, danced. I would do Rio again for the experience, we had a lot of fun."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Disappointing.

I realize that we should have said something to the waitress, but we had waited so long and just wanted to eat something. I do not think a single one of us finished our meal. That says something when you think of how hungry we were. I live around the corner so this should be a spot I go to. I'll admit when the weather is nice, it's great to sit outside on their patio.

OK, I like the laid back vibe, but when a customer is seen by a server looking around, you may say \\"let me check on your order\\"...nothing.

I've never seen a restaurant fail on so many accounts and I've had some bad experiences at certain establishments over the years.  \\n\\nI arrived with my guest and no one was around to great us at the front desk.  After waiting for several minutes we walked into the bar and found a waitress who said she could seat us in a few minutes.  Eventually we were seated and placed an order for a couple of beers.  After receiving these we waited another ten minutes and our waitress took our order.  We order boneless spare ribs which I asked to be well done, a dried hot chicken and I believe a pan friend noodle with shrimp.  About 10 minutes went by and the boneless spare ribs came out.  Much to my annoyance they were barely cooked and the furthest thing possible from well done.  I would have said something to our waitress but she never came over to see how they were.  In fact both my guest and I were now finished with our first round of drinks but since our waitress didn't come over we couldn't get another round.  Ten minutes after our appetizer our meals came.  The noodles, shrimp, and vegetables were all coated in a disgusting watery milky substance that almost made the dish inedible.  In addition some of the noodles were burnt.  The dried chicken dish was also a major disappointment.  There were small cubes of battered chicken and dried hot peppers.  Unfortunately the \\"chicken\\" was just fried batter, I don't even think I tasted any chicken.  The batter itself was salty and nothing to write home about.  After waiting about 15 minutes after trying to get through our awful food the waitress finally came over.  Yes this was the first time she came back since taking our order at the beginning of the evening.  \\n\\nShe asked how everything was and I said not great and I asked for the check.  She asked what was wrong and I told her the spare ribs weren't well done and the noodles and chicken wasn't up to par.  Her response was \\"my bad\\" in reference to the spare ribs.  She then said that a lot of people didn't like the noodle dish we got because of the milky substance in it.....well thanks for telling us after the fact.  She didn't offer any sort of apology or excuse, she took the food and walked away.  She came back a few minutes later with the check and said nothing.  After I gave her my credit card she took it charged it came back again said nothing and walked away.  On our way out she turned the other way to not look at us.  This is by far the worst service I've ever received in any restaurant.  My only regret is leaving her a tip.  \\n\\nThis place has a really cool bar but beyond that I don't get the appeal.  The Chinese food you can buy in a mall is better than this.  This restaurant would make a great case study for future restaurants on what waiters/waitresses shouldn't do.  Yelp doesn't give me the choice of leaving 0 stars so regrettably I have to give 1.

Tough for me to judge as I am not really a fan of fried cheese curds. 13 year old  really enjoyed his Fish Tacos. 15 year old thought his Salmon (served blackened) was good. Mixed reviews on the ciopinno I ordered. The clams, shrimp, and calamari in this dish were excellent but the cod was over cooked. For a ciopinno , there was not a lot of broth but I did not mind because the broth was not very flavorful. Husband's dish, Surf & Turf was a total disaster. The steak and shrimp were completely over done. The rice was extremely hard and inedible. Our server took the dish back and Husband ordered a lobster roll which was much better. \\n\\nOur server was actually excellent.

What more do you want? 5 stars.\\n\\nFrom the moment I walked into Vino Venue I knew we were going to have a good time. This gem is tucked into an un-assuming shopping center off Chamblee Dunwoody Rd next to a Tuesday Morning. There's plenty of free parking and it would also be super easy for Uber/Lyft drop off. The outside isn't anything exciting, but they do have a cute (little) patio area with some string lights. While the outside was nothing to write home about, the minute you walk into the door you are greeted by the staff at the host station as well as the beautiful sight of hundreds of bottles of wine along the wall. \\n\\nThere were 4 of us stopping in for a tasting and we did not have reservations on this particular Saturday afternoon. We bopped in at 4pm and there was no issue getting us a table in the bar area. We were given our glasses and a little white piece of paper to go around the stem of our glass to indicate we would be partaking in the tasting program. We wasted no time and set our purses and other belongings at the table and stepped right up to the bar. There was a huge bowl of truffle popcorn along with a selection of cheeses (cheddar, goat and brie) with a cute little honey pot. \\n\\nThe gentleman hosting the tasting was a sommelier and was ADORABLE, ya'll. He greeted us and was flashing the biggest smile. He explained that we'd be trying a really exciting flight - Napa vs. Sonoma. We were all about it because this particular group of girlfriends actually traveled to Sonoma a few years ago together and we are California vino lovers. He was as excited as we were to get the tasting started, so he started to pour. He was super knowledgeable and you could totally see his passion for the wine, sharing the stories of the winemakers, as well as describing differences in climates, terroirs and tasting styles. He was absolutely amazing and completely MADE the experience. While he was incredible, I do want to say all of our experience with the staff members were positive - we had a server at our table who was equally friendly and quick to get us anything we requested.\\n\\nFOOD: while not our main objective this visit, we definitely wanted to partake. They had main courses offered in the afternoon but we just wanted to snack. We *almost* ordered the piquillo peppers (and I likely will next time I visit) but decided on the burrata because......cheese. We are a bunch of cheeseheads #obsessed haha. It was served nicely on a cheese board with sliced French bread, arugula tossed in lemon, olive oil and S&P and some prosciutto. It was the perfect size to share between the 4 of us because we all got a slice of bread and just loaded it up. I will say the proscuitto was meh, but the buratta was nice and creamy and with the arugula on top it was delicious. This combined with the free offering of cheeses and popcorn from the tasting bar...we were happy cheese filled campers. :)\\n\\nAll of the wines we tasted that day were spectacular and totally up my alley. One of my friends is a member of their wine club and she gets 6 bottles a month for $100. She said this is by far the best wine club she's ever joined and that the wines have been amazing. They also provide recipes that will pair well with the wines you select for the month. Yes, you get to select the 6 bottles you receive and the list to choose from is extensive. The wines you are presented are all vetted and you're getting a great value. I'm definitely considering becoming a member, I just need to decide between the 4 or 6 bottle club!\\n\\nHighly recommend this experience and can't wait to go back!"},{"name":"Guadalajara Mexican Grill and Bar","address":"2 Florence St","city":"Malden","stars":"4","text":"Tasty food and drinks!

The house salad has more olives than lettuce and the risotto that came with the deer was inedible due to the sheer amount of olives used in the sauce. Think of an olive-based marinara sauce and you'll get a good idea of what it was like. The chicken saltimbocca is way too lemony and is topped with capers, which did not add anything to the dish.

I came here from Canada after I saw the name.

Just look at past reviews .  Invariably Persians have given low ratings for this alone... that it is not an authentic Persian restaurant.  Those of you who think food was great need to go and visit a real Persian restaurant !  If you like this then it is sad.\\n\\nWhen I entered the staff had that kind of a look as if they knew as a Persian I am not going to be impressed.  Hard to explain but I sensed it right away.\\n\\nThe workers  are all Arabic.  Owner is Arabic.  The live music is Arabic.  \\n\\nOnly one khoresht (Persian stew) on menu.\\n\\nThe kebabs don't taste like a Persian cooks here or at least someone who learned it properly.  It tastes like kebabs you would find at Arabic restaurants .  \\n\\nOther clues it is not authentically Persian ....no sumac on table !  Had to be asked for.  No tah dig (burnt rice ?) .  Asked for Persian tea at the end and even this disappointed.  Tea was brought in a beer mug like glass .  No self respecting Persian drinks tea in a beer mug. No taste or aroma like Persian tea.  Dilute.  And the kicker clue that this is really an Arabic restaurant trying to pass itself off as Persian is there was no \\"qand \\" or sugar cubes with the tea.  Just regular sugar .  It is no secret sugar cubes are a classic Persian style of having sugar with tea.  None of my Arabic friends use sugar cubes and seem genuinely surprised when presented with sugar cubes - not knowing you are supposed to put it in mouth and wash it down with the tea - Persian style !\\n\\nPlus what kind of a Persian restaurant has Moroccan live music and no Iranian ?  That pissed me off royally.  Arabic dancing I get but live music is Arabic too ? Come on !!!\\n\\nGratuities automatically added.  I usually give 20% at least anyways.  They add 18% automatically so better read your bill carefully - something I usually am not in the habit of doing .

The bar is locked only on one side, and the kitchen is an open concept (as noted by others). I was seated a little before my designated reservation time. It was only after the third server/employee spoke to me that I realized that courtesy and genuinely caring about the experience of the patron is a huge pillar of Emmer & Rye. This is highly appreciated, especially by solo travelers. \\n\\nOff the menu I did half portions of the glazed carrots and the white sonora triangoli. The mole of the glazed carrots is the true centerpiece here - the housemade miso provides a depth under the smokiness of the mole. The carrots, however, do not whither alongside this powerful mole; the subtle vinegar flavor and crispness plays well with the mole, enabling the two to accent one another well.\\n\\nThe triangoli was executed with care and perfection. It is clear that, as simplistic as the display looks, the attention to flavor is at the forefront; each bite layers perfectly in an ideal pasta dish. The wagyu is not muddled as in other wagyu dishes I've seen - rather than enhance or centerpiece the wagyu, the dish itself is designed to accent the wagyu; you notice it is there, but everything in terms of flavor is meant to uplift the wagyu more.\\n\\nThe dim sum style is definitely a unique quirk of Emmer & Rye. It is genuinely refreshing due to my travel pattern, allowing me to sample much more without needing to buy whole dishes and stuffing myself. Everything I tried was balanced very well and enticed me to try more each time.\\n\\nI finished the evening with the mustang grape tart, per a recommendation from my server Hillary (phenomenal in every respect and attentive every step of the way). The acidity of the grapes and the earthiness of the tart were in high contrast to anything you'd ever call a tart before now. The Texas cheddar added a slight savory note that subdues the sharpness of the grapes and any undue sweetness of the tart. The dish in its individual parts seems unrealistic - hearing them together instills no confidence. However, the flavors seem to fall into place when taken together; the crispness of the tart - contrary to other softer tarts I've seen - as a textural difference that excites the pallet."},{"name":"Sandoval's Cafe & Cantina","address":"460 SW Miller Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was extremely poor.

The place was relatively empty when we arrived around 5:20. The bar was empty, two at the bar and a table of three was seated and eating. That was it. No, that  was  it! No bartender in sight, no servers or busboys in sight. We were at the entrance and was greeted by the hostess. We asked for a table for two. She disappeared for a moment then came back and said OK right this way and headed toward the main dining room. We asked at that point if we could be seated in the bar and she said oh yes you can just go over there and be seated. We returned to the empty bar and found a table but it was not clean so we just kind of stood there and waited for a moment or two or 10 minutes! So we returned to the podium and asked the hostess if the bar was in fact open because we found no one and no one greeted us or acknowledged us or said anything. She said yes, right there pointing to the bartender who had  miraculously shown up. So, we went back to the bar and stood by the same table and once again the bartender disappeared came back with a plate or two for another table walked right past us said nothing did nothing and then disappeared again so now we're here 25 minutes and still haven't even been seated or greeted basically. Went back to the podium now for a third time and asked to just be seated in the main dining room. She went to seat us in the first table when you walk in and we asked if a booth was available, as there were about 50 tables open. She then came back and got us and started walking out towards yet another table and we looked at the booth that we were looking at before and then she said oh that's right you guys wanted a booth. OK sit here and walked away. We sat there for another 10 minutes before anyone came by, I believe it might've been a type of manager who's told us someone would be our server but he could get us drinks.

I've been 4 times now but this last time I had an experience that I'm just so annoyed about that it needed to be mentioned.  I ordered the black garlic ramen with pork belly.  Upon receiving my ramen I noticed two of the three pieces of pork were actually just pure fat. No meat on them.  I asked the waitress if I could get a couple more pieces of pork and showed her my pieces of fat.  She then explained to me that they use traditional pork belly and that has fat on it. I said I understand but these pieces are only fat. Theres no meat on here.  She then continued to go on about how they cook the pork and somethign about how other restaurants use the butt of the pig.  At this point I didn't want to argue about it anymore. I just said \\"ok its fine.\\" and off she went and I continued to enjoy my lunch.  A few minutes later she came back with her phone to show me pictures of what pork belly is. I was so annoyed becasue 1. I've used to work in a Bavarian restaruant and am well aware what pork belly consists of and 2. Is she really going to come over her to try to prove me wrong?  So I pointed to the photo and said \\"yes this is pork belly, and this is what you use right?\\" she answered \\"yes.\\" I then said \\"and this has some fat on it and it has some meat on it right?\\" and she said \\"yes\\" and I said \\"I had one peice that was like this and 2 pieces that did not have any meat. They were only fat.\\"  At this point I'm so irritated because I just wanted to enjoy my lunch break and I can't even believe I'm arguing about this.  She then asked if I wanted a couple more pieces of pork and I thought to myself \\"you've got to be kidding me\\" and just said \\"no thank you\\" because I was just over it. She then told me she took $2 off my bill for the pork and I said thank you but honestly... this coudl have all been avoided has she just got me some dang pork in the first place.

I have gone there in the past and always had good service.  I called Tuesday  3/26/19 afternoon as they are closed Monday.   It was my friend's 54th Birthday and i wanted to do something special for her. I had a local merchant put a \\"Happy Birthday \\" message on their billboard on Rt. 1 (  THANK YOU BCA). I asked the host on the phone if they did anything special for birthdays. he said they do a mini canolli at no cost  or can put candles in the desert. I really did not want  something for nothing and he said he would mark the reservation  so the waiter would bring  the desert with candles as a surprise.  Never happened. That was just the begining..\\n There were only 4 tables eating when we arrived. 3 seating at bar and a few near kitchen booth . not busy at all.  We were unfortunate enough to get Nicholas as our server. We placed our order and he told us there was no Fusilli. I asked how is that possible when they were closed yesterday and they just opened 1 hour ago. the 7 people eating certainly did not eat it all.   when our orders arrived  ( Veal parm and chicken cacciatore) they were delicious. The Perogies could have had more sauce and were naked. we would have liked to have grated cheese on the table however there was none. I saw some at the bar but my server Nicholas vanished and i did not see him ever again until it was time for desert. A pasta dish  with no grated cheese. unacceptable. When i ordered the lemonchella  cake for desert i was expecting the candles. After 12 minutes of waiting for a slice of cake as he vanished again without a trace,  it arrived without the birthday candles. i did  not bother to say anything to disappoint my date . Was better she did not know i planned candles. I still tipped him over 20% . I called the next day  asking for the owner Vincent. I  explained to the  hostess Brianna  and  she was understanding. She asked me to call back later at 5. I spoke  to the manager named \\" GEE\\"   He stated that the chef did not get to \\" Restaurant Depot\\" on time and that's why no Fusilli.

I can get the same packaged stuff at BJ's if i want food  not made on premises or i can go to a chain restaurant that uses SYSCO. \\nanyway, i was told  exactly a week ago the owner Vincent would call me to discuss the incident but it could take a week.  As of today 1 week later still no call.It does not seem he cares to hear from his regular (until today)  customers. if you decide to eat here.,i suggest you do not ask for Nicholas.  it's a shame  because even if they are not making the food on site, i still find it delicious.

Let's start by saying that you just need to ask your waiter what to order as some of the best items you would never pick as they sound weird or even boring. 4-5 small plates in a tapas format ie enough for 2 people and they also have 3 dim sum like walk around tray servings. This place is like visiting Portlandia. For example my wife ordered a mesquite pod that falls from local trees that they ground into flower and toast then top it with sorghum that they pop like popcorn and top with thinly sliced okra and a spray sauce. I'm not making this up. And of course it was delicious. That's just an example. We sat at the chefs table which is so fun. They talked us in to chicken as a shared entree which was amazing with local true organic birds that they soak in broth etc etc. so yes we ordered chicken. The descriptions were almost comical but the food really was amazing. For desert they suggested the bread pudding with no bread and the sorbet and guess what the sorbet was the best thing I ate all night. Sorbet! It was watermelon sorbet with salted Creme on top. Absolutely amazing. Fresh watermelon and salted creme! The prices were reasonable given the quality of the food and service. I love this place and it was very entertaining. Warning my dad who wants spaghetti and meatballs with red sauce would hate this place so only go if you want to see creative usage of local food. Don't expect normal. Oh and they even have a \\"forager\\" on staff who's job is to find wild food growing in fields around Austin to add to the menu like wild onions    Do you know at restaurant with a forager?"},{"name":"Cardone's Restaurant & Bar","address":"377 W Main St","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"We had a reservation for Friday night and arrived early, we were greeted warmly and they were able to seat us and get us drinks while we waited for the rest of our party.\\nThe restaurant is small but comfortable and they do have a covered patio in front.

You are my one true love.\\n\\nEmmer & Rye was the first restaurant I ever dined at in Austin; it stole my heart away and never gave it back. And in a lengthy review/love note, I will tell you why:\\n\\nVibes:\\n\\nThe interior is modern but still cozy. The decor is subtle but pays homage to grains and local ingredients, which is the main staple of their food. A sleek bar is front-and-center right as you enter the restaurant, welcoming guests to have a drink while waiting for a table. The bartenders are always friendly and game to make you any kind of drink you want, even if you only give them a base liquor or a few flavors to start from. I typically come to the restaurant before my reservation time (yes, always make a reservation) just to hang out and relax before being seated.\\n\\nDinner:\\n\\nI am small plates' biggest fan. If you're not in the mood to go on a culinary adventure and pick appetizers off of a rolling cart, share bites with friends, or become familiar with ingredients you've never heard of, then this might not be your place. However, if you're ready to for a real food ~experience~ then you will love having dinner here. \\n\\nEmmer & Rye changes their menu frequently to use ingredients that are in season. I've bid farewell to many a beloved dish, but I'll admit that the constant menu changes keep me coming back for more. One mainstay that is an absolute must is the cacio e pepe. The noodles are freshly made and the sauce is creamy and cheesy without being overly rich. \\n\\nThe circulating cart will pass you a few times during your meal, timed perfectly between courses. Servers are well-versed in how each plate is made and are quick to make suggestions or recommendations if you're overwhelmed by the options. It feels like a \\"choose your own\\" amuse-bouche, which again, I am very into. If there's any part of the food that I've been medium about, it's usually these smaller circulating plates, but it's also part of the fun of trying them because you get to see (and taste) the kitchen's newest experiments. \\n\\nDesserts here are also 100% worth trying. They are typically composed of sweet and savory flavors so even those without a sweet tooth will still find something to enjoy.\\n\\nBrunch:\\n\\nMore freshly-sourced, in-season, carefully-composed food. Their brunch menu is not as expensive as I might expect it to be, however, portions are also typically smaller than you will find at other restaurants around Austin.\\n\\nMany of their entrees, even when they rotate them, feature \\"perfectly scrambled eggs.\\" And yes, if you are wondering, they are perfect. The best scrambled eggs I have ever had. Softer, lighter, and fluffier than you can believe is possible. If you see these on the menu try them.\\n\\nI have seen/heard that they're trying out new themed menus every three months, which I have yet to taste (never fear, I have a brunch reservation this weekend). And if there's anything I love more than small plates, it's a good theme. \\n\\nUntil mid-June their menu is Caribbean-themed after which it will be American Diner-themed for the remainder of the summer. \\n\\nYay Themes! Yay Brunch! \\n\\nService:\\n\\nFrom the hostess stand to the final bill, staff members are attentive, knowledgeable, and kind. They offer recommendations and guidance on the menu without being overly chatty, etc. If any mistakes happen, they are quick to fix them. It's obvious that the people who work here are passionate about the food and your experience as a diner. \\n\\nThe End:\\n\\nIf anyone has made it this far into my review, I salute you.

And all those handful times that I visited Cactus Club from different locations there is never a disappointment time at all! A suggestion from me to anyone who is trying to come here is to make a reservation just to be safe because from times they do get super busy, especially on the weekends. But if you don't mind having to wait 20-40 mins then go right ahead. \\n\\nCustomer service here was great, our server was super nice and she was on top with everything we asked, from refilling our drinks to making sure we were doing okay with our food. She also had conversations with us about the handful of places that are opened and different dessert places that she recommended us to try and that was a plus because any server who interact with their customers just makes everything better. \\n\\nNow! Let's get to the food, when you come here make sure to try their truffle fries and calamari for your appetizers, but make sure you share both of that dish because it can get a lot and trying to eat that by yourself won't be satisfying and sharing is caring right? The first time ever I came here I got the creole steak + prawn and that was amazing, I usually don't like getting steaks at restaurants because they never cook it to your saying but Cactus Club does a great job! Medium rare and it comes out perfect, and the meat just melts in your mouth because of how soft it is. I also recommend the Millionaire's Cut too, it is about the same as the other steak(12oz Strip-loin). \\n\\nAlso if you love some fish tacos, give their Baja Fish Tacos a try! You get 3 tacos and a side of fries, the fish is cooked perfectly. Fish inside is soft and the battered was crispy and not super crunchy. Overall, the experience is 10/10 recommend and trust me, you won't be disappointed at all!"},{"name":"1927 S'mores Company","address":"1126 SW Alder St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If you want the best high quality s'mores kit and additional marshmallows- this place is the winner of all things s'mores!

This is of course the logic behind their local and organic farm-to-table menu of dressed-up Southern dishes. So, naturally, it's going to feature quintessentially Southern ingredients, like truffles and kale. The kale salad with eggplant croutons is like the shirt emblazoned with \\"KALE\\" that Whole Foods sells but without  the humor. The interior design, which features white-washed, wood-grain-exposed woods, might be described as \\"upscale farmhouse,\\" but there's an austerity to it that precludes a down-home, communal feel. This is perhaps reinforced by the price point, which makes it anything but a common watering hole back in the Pleistocene.

I've overlooked a lot, but I recently had two experiences that were so horrible I can't even bring myself to go here anymore.\\n\\nThe first: It was a fairly busy Saturday, and they were quite busy. But somehow they LOST MY SANDWICH. I was on break at the time, and in a hurry. But when I point out that they gave me the wrong sandwich, they acted like I was inconveniencing them, and told me to get BACK IN LINE. Um, no. YOU handed me the wrong sandwich, and it's just good customer service to FIX IT. It took me 45 minutes just to get down there, get my sandwich, and get back to my shop. And my break is only 30 minutes long. Thanks bunches, Subway!\\n\\nBut, okay, fine. It was busy. Accidents happen. They treated me pretty badly, but whatever. I'll give them another shot.\\n\\nA few weeks later, I was there getting a sandwich and a drink, and the guy hands me a drink that had AT LEAST two inches empty. I asked him nicely if he might be able to please finish filling it up for me, since I was going to be stuck at my store all night alone and didn't want to run out of drink halfway through my shift, and he sighed, and huffed, and puffed, and finally filled my cup up. And then...he kept filling it up. So that the ice was sticking WAY out of the cup, and there was no possible way I could get a lid on it without spilling soda everywhere. He handed it back to me with a smirk, knowing full well that he overfilled it.\\n\\nI tried to put a lid on it, and, as predicted, soda went all over the counter. I tried to ask the guy for a napkin to clean it up and he just walked off (NOT going to get me napkins, though). I waited. And waited. And finally the guy came back. And I asked him again if I could please have a napkin. He handed me ONE napkin, again knowing full well that one wouldn't cut it. So I try to mop up my puddle of soda, and then I ask him for another napkin, to which he responds rudely. \\n\\nI finally just snapped and said, \\"LOOK, I'm trying to do you a favor, and my break is almost over. Can I PLEASE have another napkin so I can clean up YOUR counter? Or I can just leave it.\\" He handed me ONE MORE NAPKIN. \\n\\nSo I put the napkin in the puddle and walked off. And I haven't been back since.\\n\\nI admit, I was rude towards the end of that second incident. But most people wouldn't have even tried to clean up the mess...and I was trying to do him a favor.

He got chicken. On a stick. With no seasoning. But we kept on keeping on and tried the scallion pancakes. I'll say this, the scallion pancakes were like a 6/10. The texture was good but once again no seasoning. It's like they were made by a white person or something. Then, me with the blood already drained from my face, tried my veggie delight. \\n\\nWhen I tell you that my four year old niece could have made a better plate than that trash on a plate I am not lying. The veggies were over cooked, under seasoned and practically water chestnuts and celery. Those are the shitty filler veggies in the veggie delight. I've never been so sad in my life.

What's the name of that festival again...\\n\\nThe concept of trying 6-9 different wines from 3:00-5:00 ? What sign me up! LOL. After initially tasting all the wines I found the 1 I absolutely loved which was a sweet dry and I drunk that the remainder of the evening. The Employees interact and drink with you to the point one of the Employees was wasted  and driving. We watched in awe of her drunken state and the Supervisor not taking her keys. I said a prayer that she makes it safely to her destination and no harm comes to her or anyone else... There is also complimentary popcorn, assorted cheese, fruit infused water and a full menu is also available."},{"name":"FuddoYama Ramen","address":"8610 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I don't think I will come to this restaurant again.

Everything is, really. I love the avocado toast. We've been coming here since they opened, and there is nothing on the menu that isn't amazing. But the service gets worse every time I go there. Seriously terrible. I've ordered the avocado toast and they have forgotten to put the avocado on it. We usually order a waffle to go and they forget it 90% of the time.  It's absolutely not worth going after 8:00am on weekends.  Today was the last straw for me. We got there at 11:00, and I knew we would wait. It's fine. But after 30 minutes, we hadn't moved much on the list and there were people behind us being seated. Huh. So at the 45 minute mark I went inside and stood by the desk. The hostess seated another party of three that just walked in immediately, right in front of me. I brought the other two people with me to stand at the hostess stand so that they could see we were all here and ready to go. There were three tables open that stayed that way for the next five minutes -- two were not bussed and one was set up and ready. No one paying any attention to getting the line of people seated. Even after we were seated it took someone another five minutes to come take our order. We are at the one hour mark of our Gigi's visit at this point. After waiting another 20 minutes for our food -- and I can't make this up, friends -- our waiter comes over to tell us that our order \\"got lost\\" and do we still want it??  Seriously. Yes. Actually, we are now EXTREMELY hangry. Food is amazing, we are eating as fast as we can. Ask for the check. Ask them to remove the \\"to go\\" waffle, which they had forgotten as usual and which they eventually comped. \\n\\nAll said, by all means go during the week or at 7:00am on a weekend morning. But the weekends are an absolute nightmare and not even remotely worth it. Gigi's owners/managers/staff:  please get it together.

Again, they'd been sitting for a while, along with the other steamed items we chose. Then we ordered the stuffed peppers, the noodles with shrimp, turnip rice cakes from the cart. The server told us she'd be back with these items. Apparently, the cart items are just for show. After 5 minutes or so, our dim sum plated items arrived. Everything was lukewarm. Then, we decided to order lo mein from the menu thinking that anything freshly cooked would be hot. We got a big plate of noodles that was warm (not hot) on the outside. The broccoli in it was cool/cold (probably just out of the fridge). As we dug deeper into the noodles, we noticed that they too were only lukewarm on the inside; therefore, we surmised our lo mein had been prepared earlier and reheated in a microwave or some other quick heating appliance. \\n\\nWe have 364 days to find a better Chinese restaurant for next Christmas.

They brought the chicken out as 1 piece  that you have to cut up yourself which I thought was strange. I asked the waiter to have the cook chop my chicken. When it came back out it was super cold and he said they had to cook my fried rice.. The rice came out and guess what... It was cold as well. I was in a rush so I just ate it but I told the waiter and manager that I was disappointed in the food today and the manager said its cold because I sat on the patio.. Really ?

Which is pretty rare in these hotels. A few things puts it over the top for me. That being a indoor pool with a hot tub. Plus that Restaurant/ sports bar downstairs lobby level called Burger Theory. Offering up a good selection of craft beers ( counted 9) along with 20 or so on draft. Menu is pretty extensive. Serving up burgers , salads and a nice glass of wine.\\n\\nService was southern hospitality at it's best. So pleasant at the front desk for that early in and check out. Even those wait staff at the restaurant were a pleasant surprise. You can tell that they truly enjoy their jobs with a smile.

I ordered 4 entr√©es, two bulgogi bowls, a spicy chicken bowl and kimchi fried rice.\\nNone were authentic to food served in Korea, which is asking a lot I know... but it was the inconsistent portioning that really got me. Barely any bulgogi made it into either bowl (approx 2/3 of the smallish scoop they use or maybe 1.5 to 2 ounces), and the young lady preparing them pantomimed a second scoop on each which was actually quite comical (it was empty both times). So it was all dry white rice and noodles. Not even enough broth to give the rice some flavor made it to the bowl. The reason this was significant is because it was the bulgogi I came for and the rest was afterthought to round out the meal. \\nThe spicy chicken bowl though was overflowing with chicken. More than I would expect. It was flavorful and very good though not truly authentic to Korea. \\nFrom there it was downhill. The kimchi fried rice was nothing like what you find in Korea on the street or in restaurants. It was closer to a crepe with dry rice and kimchi inside. Nothing fried about it and completely mush if taken to go. Oddly it lost all the heat kimchi normally brings so it was rather bland. Even adding the sides of kimchi didn't really help.\\n\\nOverall given the difficulty of the location, general unfriendliness and the way my order was stopped mid preparation to get the only other customer her tea in conjunction with 3/4 of the dishes being flavorless, I would not recommend K-Bop if you want to taste Korean food.

I loved that they have a designated dance floor and the fact that there's a DJ. On that Friday night I think Boston was kind of dead - I had gone to another lounge beforehand and there was only a handful of people. In Emerald there was no cover and no one was really dancing - only these three girls who were trying to get wild but no one was trying to have it lol. \\n\\nOn Saturday I decided to come back and there was a $20 cover charge per person - we were lucky and only paid $20 for the two of us. As soon as we went in we realized they were hosting a high school reunion too. It was a mixed crowd, half of the people were there because of the reunion and the other half were random people trying to have fun. Overall, I had a blast on Saturday for about an hour and a half and then everyone left (the reunions people decided to call the night early and go home around 11:45 - they couldn't hang lol). The whole thing was pretty crowded for that hour and a half and people were actually dancing/drinking. The DJ was playing some pretty solid music which made me so happy - I was dancing my butt off. Overall, I think the set up of this place is cool (I love dancing so the fact there was a separate dance floor was awesome).

Now you're probably wondering why the one-star review? The place was clean, friendly and empty, the staff was cordial, and the food was average. I give it a one-star review because the bill came to almost $60 for mac & cheese, 2 glasses of cheap red wine and a small carrot cake!!

We ordered the yam fries and they were delicious.  For the meal I ordered the creole steak and prawns, cooked medium.  Both mine and my friend's steaks were not cooked medium as we had ordered.  They were definitely closer to the medium well realm.  The \\"prawns\\" on my steak were small and uninspiring.  \\n\\nThe lower rating comes from our service.  We had to remind our waitress a few times that she hadn't brought our ice waters or silverware.  She also seemed to disappear for long periods of time.

I could see how it could be frustrating for someone who does not speak Spanish to order.

It's very centered around meat and unique dishes that many cultures haven't understood or really given a chance. And I will admit, fermented veggies that my friend's Mother would stow away for months above the fridge used to make my stomach churn. I'm saying this all just to give warning on taking to heart lower ratings from those who don't really know/appreciate Korean food. With that said, I definitely do and am Korean myself. \\n\\nThe menu I admit is intense and intimidating... between random English and Korean fonts mixed with a plethora of options, it's really hard to make a decision. I'm a huge fan of their dolsot ('stone pot') bibimbap ('mixed meal'). It's rice covered in seasoned veggies, chili paste, egg and meat of your choice. I always get beef. It is served in a stone pot which is piping hot. You let the food sit for a couple of minutes allowing the rice to get crunchy where it's touching the stone... when you stir everything together the egg and ingredients cook more and become a mix of crunchy and chewy. It's so delicious and they also bring out a bottle of kochujang sauce, which you drizzle over the entire dish. It's really fantastic and well done here. Many places don't serve this dish in the stone pot which is the finishing touch on both cooking and appeal.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the BBQ. They have pages of meat options and the combos that they come in... it's confusing. But once you pick which you want, grab the meat scissors and start grilling away at your table! Their meat is cut correct with the grain, thick slices and fresh. Dishes all come with banchan -- traditional side dishes and usually about 12 varieties. From seaweed, potato shoots, tofu, spinach, kim chi varieties, daikon, cucumbers, bean sprouts etc... the options are not lacking. \\n\\nAnother dish I recommend is their short rib. It melts off the bone and is served with veggies. Delicious!\\n\\nToji has a great selection of Soju served cold as can be. Beers as well.\\n\\nThe service I also admit can be slow to start with ordering, but once it's in you're golden. This isn't one of your wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am restaurants. You come here to eat, enjoy the food, drink and enjoy the company. Katie is a sweetheart too... if you go you'll meet her, she is always working. You'll definitely spend more here than at other joints but it's worth it! Korean food in general is more pricey.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very clean and modern compared to many Korean joints around town. They also have an addiction to their air conditioning unit, it's seriously always freezing in there and the bathroom is the worst -- like taking a whizz in the great outdoors of Antarctica. Aside from the AC thing I love this place. \\n\\nAll in all I highly recommend this place. Not the best Korean I've had (comparing to K-Town, LA ... Korea central USA) but it's the best in Portland!\\n\\nGun bae!!!!"},{"name":"Texas Roadhouse","address":"102 Boston Providence Hwy","city":"Walpole","stars":"3","text":"Ok, I have been to Texas Roadhouse before but this is the first time here and mostly the last.

Overall, the taste was good but the portion size was small and price was a bit on the high side. For our ramen, I was surprised they asked what kind of noodles we wanted - thick or thin as well as the firmness. It was nice for them to split the portion in half. The Char Shu Bao came in two - they were served with pickles and covered in spicy sauce. For the Char Shu Bao, I wish they had spicy sauce (Sriracha) on the side for those who don't enjoy eating spicy food. I loved the octopus salad - baby octopus marinated in sweet vinegar! The takoyaki was mostly filler and was served with a thick sauce that tasted like A1 / Lea and Perrin sauce. The fresh spring rolls are Vietnamese Style.

Found this place after a hike at Chautauqua (thanks, Yelp!) and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't completely packed (because Pearl St definitely was). We sat down on their open but heated porch--such a treat for a November day in Colorado--just in time to catch the end of brunch (which goes until 2 pm). \\n\\nThere were four in our group and we each ordered drinks--I tried the bloody mary. It was decent, but not my favorite ever. My sister ordered the bloody maria with house infused spicy pepper tequila, which made me wish I was a tequila drinker. The other two in our group ordered The Post Townie Ale in a can and a Corona (always a solid choice).\\n\\nNow for the nosh! I ordered a centro cazuela--a hearty bowl of sweet potato-plantain hash, spinach, two fried eggs, chile rojo, and guac (I had mine without cotija). This was a little on the salty side, but tasty and filling. The rest of the group ordered the breakfast burrito (only $5--such a steal!), the baja fish sandwich, the hash browns, and two of their tacos. I'd have to say the hash browns were the most interesting part of the meal--two scone-shaped cakes doused in green chili and sprinkled with cheese. Their shape made them sort of like getting that perfect corner of the brownie--the crispy edges made them way better than your average hash browns. \\n\\nI was really impressed with their accommodations statement on their menu. They aim to please vegan, raw, vegetarian, pescatarian, gluten free, dairy free, soy free, and paleo diets, which is a huge feat. With so many people working with an allergy, sensitivity, or personal choice these days, it's cool to see a restaurant go the extra mile to be inclusive to their diners.

I really thought I'd done a review, but I guess I never got around to it- until today!\\n\\nMy grandparents have had 2 places that they looove to go to eat Sunday lunch- this is the better one. In all honesty, Maximo's has fantastic gyros, sandwiches, salads, and other Greek fare. \\n\\nPersonally, I love their Persian Chicken Kubideh (in a wrap) and the Philly Cheesesteak (as a sandwich or a wrap). The Persian Chicken Kubideh comes with tzatziki sauce, onions, tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and green peppers. I prefer to add feta cheese to any sandwich or wrap I try- because feta rocks (!) and why not in a Greek restaurant? \\n\\nI prefer their Chicken Caesar salad over the Greek salads, but that's just my personal preference in taste. My uncle is very much in love with their Greek salads. The Chicken Caesar salad comes with thigh meat (which you can change to breast meat if you want- but why would you???) and they season the meat beautifully. The chicken is delightfully tender and wonderfully juicy. Plus, the portion of chicken is fabulous.\\n\\nThere's always a tell-tale sign of whether a restaurant does a good job (or not) on their particular type of food. When it comes to Greek, I think the falafel tells you all you need to know. The falafel here is great! Perfectly crisp all around, yet moist and piping hot in the inside. They make their falafel out of freshly ground chickpeas (not a dried mix) and it shows. \\n\\n[I recommend getting the falafels individually, rather than purchasing the \\"appetizer\\" because you get more falafel for your buck while the appetizer comes with pita bread and hummus- why?]\\n\\nThe kabobs are excellent as well, although they are about double the price of sandwiches/wraps. \\n\\nGive them a shot.

My brisket was nice and moist but very small serving size.  My wife just had the brisket and had 5 slices.  The 2 meat tray had just 2 slices of brisket.  I wasn't necessarily expecting 2 full servings of meat, but given the price premium I wasn't expecting less than half a serving.     The cheesy grits were tasty.  They were served in a mug and were a bit runny which made eating them with a fork a bit of a challenge.  With no spoon in sight I just drank them from the mug.    The coleslaw was very chunky, and okay, but nothing to get overly excited about.  \\n\\nOne of our party was a vegetarian and had a pretty thin selection.

My father in law finally had to get up and ask the hostess to send the Manager over. We had young children who were becoming unruly from hunger. They never brought bread or even refilled our water the entire time. The rude Manager came over and was dismissive, raised his voice and never apologized for anything.

What a joke. When the food finally did come, only half the table received food. They brought a dish over that no one ordered and of course I never received my dish.

It sounded so promising to have a local cafe here in Hamlin.  My neighbors have been anxiously waiting for it to open. \\n\\nGranted, I went on a \\"soft\\" opening day with limited selections.  The coffee was nothing special.  It's in canisters on the side, self service, like WaWa.  The pastry case had only four selections when I was there:  plain croissants, chocolate croissants, Nutella beignets, and Nutella pastry.  Not a big variety at all - but again, this was the soft opening. I can forgive that. \\n\\nHere is what I can't forgive.  I was the only one in the store at about 4pm, and ordered two chocolate croissants and one beignet to go.  The cashier boxed them up, and I left, going over to Publix across the parking lot  When in the car, I opened the box, as I was going to have one of the croissants while I shopped. I noticed then that the order was wrong - I had a Nutella pastry.  So I took it back.  \\n\\nWhat happened when I returned the pastry was inexcusable.  A woman  (manager? owner?) came over to see what was wrong.  She took back the Nutella pastry....and ....wait for it.....put it back in the pastry case to resell it.  As I said, that pastry had been out of the store and in my car, driven to Publix. I didn't touch it, but how did she know that?  It has to be against Board of Health rules to resell food items that have been delivered to customers.  \\n\\nThat health violation alone is enough to have me not return, and the chocolate croissant wasnt good enough to tempt me into changing my mind. They advertise a French pastry chef, but I found the croissant a little dry, and lacking in layers. The chocolate filling was just a few cold studs of chocolate in the middle, not smooth chocolate.  Perhaps this is just a style thing, but it wasn't my preference.  \\n\\nThere is a lot of confusion among my neighbors between this place, and My French Cafe in Lakeside.

A glance at the menu results in a bit of sticker shock for basic family style Indian - many dishes were in the $11-and-up range (whereas at a similar place in, say, SF, you'd be paying in the $8-$9 range at most). The dish options read like your average Indian place. Fortunately when I visited, we had quite a few folks at the table, so we were able to order and sample a decent number of things. \\n\\nMost all of the food offered to us was good but not great. About what I'd find on average in Portland, a town decidedly lacking in good Indian food. For these prices, however, I'd be expecting either larger dishes, more frills (aka atmosphere), or better quality, and really, Annapurna did not deliver on any one of those three. The saag was okay, the aloo gobi was... for lack of a better term, just okay as well, and the naan was small and expensive. It was again, about average quality, but not really for the price.\\n\\nThe major reason to write this otherwise malaise-driven review is to warn you from ordering the papri chaat. This is a dish that's normally comprised of crispy crackers served with some tamarind chutney, mint chutney, and raita, all for dipping. Here, they took cardboard-like thick bread (seriously, it tasted incredibly stale and chewy - like maybe some of yesterday's naan?) and chopped it up and drowned it in a puddled mix of the two chutneys and yogurt. It was a soupy mess with hunks of \\"chewy.\\" Imagine taking very stale, chewy saltines and drenching them in a thin sauce and serving that on a plate. It was inedible (again, I'm being generous here) and all but a few bites of the dish ended up on the plate headed back to the dishwasher. For a group of adventurous eaters, that's saying a lot. \\n\\nOther than that monstrosity, the rest of the meal was simply... okay, with the bill being more expensive than it should be.

We made an easy, last minute reservation for 6:30 p.m. At 4:30 p.m. they still had reservations available for 7:30 p.m., btw.\\n\\nThe layout has changed a bit from the former El Arbol set up. Although I still love the bar/patio on the second floor, I think there are still issues with servers blocking the end of the bar (entry to bathrooms) and people gathering at the top of the steps to mingle. It's still an odd configuration up there. The main entrance has changed to be accessible from the back of the restaurant, from the small parking area, instead of from the front of the restaurant, which was fine except the new \\"reception area\\" is tiny. There were at least 4 - 5 young girls standing around and again, it's an awkward area for greeting, seating and eating. You can no longer access the 2nd floor bar from the parking lot. That stairway has been removed. I didn't make it to the 3rd floor but it's my understanding it's intended to be a private dining area not, as opposed to another bar/patio area.\\n\\nHere's a link to the menu from eater.com: http://oliveandjune-austin.com/olive-...\\n\\nNote the $54 entree and the $24 1/2 chicken. Wow. I inquired about the $54 dollar option because at first glance, it appeared to be a pasta dish (served with gold?). I was told it was a steak dish. I'm not used to seeing prices like that from an Italian place but I was intrigued that they were so proud of their food.\\n\\nWe ordered 3 of the small plates. When i say small plates, I mean small; there was only enough served for 2 bites (2 pieces). We ordered the zucchini which was our favorite, the risotto which we both thought would be a serving dish of typical risotto but turned out to be 2 tater tot sized fried risotto things, and the artichoke. The risotto was unremarkable; it just tasted like fried pasta and the artichoke was better than I've had at other places, texture wise but very bland and a tad bitter.\\n\\nAfter those 3 small plates, we both decided to skip an entree and went for the Escarole Salad and fried egg. The salad and oil dressing were good and fresh but my egg was a bit overdone (think crispy on the edges). This salad is served with diced bits of thick bacon that is warm, not crispy in any way. It was odd to eat bits of fat with my salad. It's an odd combination that I could've done without. The description said pancetta and I thought thin, crispy strips of pancetta would be sprinkled on the salad. Wrong.\\n\\nSo...I think this place is on par with Gusto quite frankly. Good idea, nice place, food is ok. The prices here make me more cautious about what to order. Hopefully they will have a rotating menu.\\n\\nI will say that they have 100% improved the bar chairs at the bar on the second floor. The wire ones from El Arbol were very uncomfortable.

The host that seated us was kind enough to come by and refill my tea and my water after I had drank them both fully and they had set empty for 10 minutes. The host wound up taking our dessert order and then we finally see our waitress once more as she delivers the desserts to the table.\\n\\nEven with atrocious, inexcusable service this place still gets four stars. The sushi here is easily the best I've had in Austin so far. Granted I haven't had the chance to visit uchi yet, and it's been awhile since I've eaten at Tomodachi\\n\\nThe lobster nigiri was buttery and rich, the bluefin otoro melted in your mouth and the albacore was seared and well dressed. The suicide salmon was spicy and the texture excellent. I didn't have one piece of sushi that wasn't fresh, flavorful and had excellent mouth feel. The eel was soft as butter yet crispy around the edges and not drenched in sauce. The Tamago was light and fluffy.\\n\\nThe spider roll sported an enormous portion of softshell crab, the most I've seen in any spider roll.\\n\\nThe escolar appetizer was tender and rich. The pork belly was sweet and juicy. The grilled salmon cheek was tender and fatty and crispy on the outside. I literally did not try any dish here in which I thought \\"oh this small change could have made this better.\\" All of the flavor profiles were exactly what I was looking for in the dish that I ordered.\\n\\nEven with the horrible service that marred this otherwise perfect dining experience. I still felt compelled to leave an $80 tip in hopes that most of it would go to The expert chefs.\\n\\nOn a side note, the menu here is designed horridly. It doesn't stay open well enough or open far enough. And I don't know if it's seen as low class, but, they really need to have the list that lets you mark quantities of nigiri to order. This lets me easily add or subtract as I'm looking through the menu rather than having to sit there and try to recite it all to the waitress."},{"name":"Thornton's Fenway Grille","address":"100 Peterborough St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here on a Sunday and it seemed to be extremely understaffed.

The food was fine, but the service was terrible. I arrived alone at the restaurant to meet a friend. I waited at the entrance by the host's area for a couple of minutes and was served by no one and was not even addressed and asked to wait a moment. Since my friend had not arrived yet I took a seat in the outside seating area to wait. There was only one couple eating outside and I sat far away from them so as not to disturb. A waiter came outside and stood across from the table from where I was seated, stared me down, arms crossed, and did not say a word. Awkwardly, I said \\"Hi! Im just waiting on a friend I'm meeting here.\\" She told me I am not allowed to just sit out there without seeing the host. I told her I had in fact come in and waited and had not been helped. She said I should have waited longer if I actually intended to eat there and could not use their seating, as though I was a loiterer. I assured her I was planning to eat there and was just waiting for a friend; we would come in when she arrived. The waiter rolled her eyes and walked away. I was so shocked. I have never been treated so badly at a restaurant. If she thought I was loitering, she could have politely asked \\"Sorry, is there anything I can help you with?\\" and after I explained I had been waited to be served to no avail, apologized for the inconvenience. When my friend finally arrived, we decided to still try the place out. When we went inside, the same waiter seated us back at the exact table I'd been waiting at (how ironic) and proceeded to plaster a fake smile on her face while she served us, no apology given. I will never return. As a person of color, there is no way for me to prove that she had acted in prejudice, but regardless, there was nothing pleasant about this encounter. I felt embarrassed and angry. The food was only okay but I realize the distasteful treatment may have influenced my opinion.

Of course theirs malt vinegar for authenticity and ketchup for those of you who can't enjoy the chips without. \\n\\nI've yet to venture downstairs or enjoyed a summer night on the patio, but I look forward to both as I plan to visit many more times. Some times they have live music, I know, that's what made me go the first time.\\n\\nIf I lived closer I'd spend a lot of time happily getting to know the staff at this perfectly charming pub. \\n\\np.s. my friend had the Shepherds Pie the first visit, she said it wasn't very good.

The waitress suggested we enjoy our meal family style so we tried quite a few dishes. However, the dishes veered closer to the smaller side, though we were in a larger group. We started with the celery root and apple salad which was really quite delicious. We also got the cauliflower pizza which was very unique and yummy. The margherita was also pretty good - simple, zesty and fresh. However, quite charred but with some nice leoparding. With our steak, we got a side of roasted carrots which were honestly the best carrots I had in my life, dressed with a nice sunflower pesto and some honey. My fave pasta was the culurgiones with sunchokes and sage. Kinda a cross between gnocchi and ravioli and pretty yummy.

I get that your meal is supposed to be enjoyed slowly over four courses but you should not have to wait 5 to 10 minutes for your first Drink. You should not have to ask your waiter for a refill of your drink when it has been sitting empty for 15 minutes. Our waiter never brought sweetener for my child's iced tea.

Would have loved to ask for another refill but our waiter was hard to flag down. \\n\\n- The food here was extremely disappointing. Seriously I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant that expensive with food that is that terrible. I honestly do not see how it has so many great reviews. The food simply had no flavor. We got the cheeseboard which was really good. I got the crustini and the Primavera salad. Absolutely no flavor. Tasted  like I'm just eating plain lettuce and a peppery piece of bread. My husband got the whip cream tomato antipasti, it just tasted like we are eating plain cream. \\n\\n- our waiter said  that the antipasti was supposed to serve as a palette cleanser. $26 Of bland food for something a piece of bread can accomplish, but I thought surely the pasta is good. It was not. I got Campanelle  which was way too lemony. My husband got the Italian basic pasta with meatballs. Both were ok but not great. My husband also got the steak. The creamed parsnip was delicious, but the vegetable slaw was bland and the steak was over charred. You can get a better steak at Applebee's. \\n\\nOverall a very disappointing experience.

He makes an effort to chat with the tables in the restaurant, which is a nice human touch you don't see from higher ups in many Disney locations. You can tell that this venture is a very important one to him. The location and space is set up nicely, with airy outdoor seating up on the second floor, allowing for a nice view of Disney Springs. The lower bar is also one of my favorite spots in this location to grab a drink. The food is delicious (the steak and the Big Board are must tries, and my regular go tos), and the wine selection is rather stunning, with something for every wine drinker. Food has always come out promptly and is pretty consistent the many times I've gone.\\n\\nThe Ehh: As I said previously, food comes out promptly. The wait is in actually being seen to once you sit down, at a table or at the bar. There have been times where I've waited at the bar for service for several minutes, with at least two bartenders and servers at the bar, but just chatting amongst each other. Usually I'm not in a hurry when I come here, but it's something to note if you are - and something that may come off negatively if you aren't a regular. \\n\\nTheir food is delicious, like I said, and obviously worth it as I keep coming back. I've had the Grilled Octopus, the Mac & Cheese Bites, the Burrata, the Chicken Skewers, the Big Board, and the Skirt Steak, and none have disappointed save for maybe the skewers and the burrata. However, though the portions are large for their family-style menu items, the prices are crazy for what you get - even by Disney Springs standards. The food is supposed to be shareable portions, but I'll tell you right now that I've easily killed off the steak by myself, on more than one occasion. $60 is a lot for a steak for one person. \\n\\nThe other space where I see inconsistency is the host stand. Depending on the host at the stand, I can already tell walking up what kind of interaction I'm going to be having. Sometimes you get a smiling and bubbly host, or a polite and professional host where you know they know what they're doing, and other times you end up with a cold and off-putting host. These are always the same people each time, in both the positive and negative areas. It's unfortunate that there isn't more of a positive standard in this across the board.\\n\\nAll in all, this is still one of my favorite restaurants in Springs, and I'll continue to be a regular.

He says give me a second, and comes back with a tab for our half full drinks sitting at his roach infested bar and says with a straight face, I took the wings off. I was in awe.

The burger was cooked to perfection, super tasty and juicy. The bun was toasty and crisp, yet soft at the same time. They made the classic burger taste amazing and special! The fries were also the right amount of fried and texture. Finally, the salad was was crispy and light, and I loved the amount of cherry tomatoes and avocado to add different texture in every bite.

I tried the Berry Burst hot but should have probably drank it cold. Ms. Elaine told me it was a good tea cold but I decided to drank it hot. I should have listened. I could tell it was probably better iced. Hot, the taste reminded me a little of cold syrup. I cant stand any drink that taste like or reminds me of cold/cough syrup.

We really enjoyed the Autumn Salad which consists of Granny Smith apples, dried cranberries, sunflower seed, Vermont cheddar, Apple cider vinaigrette and the Caesar Salad with Grilled Shrimp which consists of corn tortilla strips, diced roasted red pepper, and anchovy and gave this salad a Mexican flare. There was nothing spectacular about the Roasted Pear & Beet Salad, Our party also ordered the CBC Burger which came with glazed onions and cheese and Swiss Burger.

I had been once before a few years ago and had a good experience, but being italian from the northeast, I am very wary of italian restaurants in Austin and wanted to come when the whole menu was 50% to give the food another try. If you can make it for that hour window, the HH specials are awesome. Again, the whole menu is half off, as is beer and cocktails (only wine is excluded). \\n\\nWe got there right at 5 and were seated downstairs. It's worth mentioning a lot of reviews discuss waiting, and we were there for two hours and never saw anyone wait for a table. The downstairs was actually fairly empty especially for a Friday night, but the bar upstairs from what I could tell was full/crowded. We got the sicilian margarita, which was pretty good! \\n\\nFor food we ordered the seafood fritto misto, the beet and goat cheese salad and the farm egg over polenta to start. The egg and polenta dish is the reason I wanted to go back- I remembered it from a couple years ago and yes, i find it THAT GOOD. If you're hung up on texture maybe not- it's a pretty soft dish (polenta, runny egg, parm cheese and mushrooms) but I LOVE it. The beet and goat cheese salad was great, kinda hard to mess that up though, and i LOVED the fritto misto. Whatever they dress the arugula with was delicious, you don't even need to use the dipping aioli they give and everything was fried well and not greasy. We then, for \\"dinner\\", split the pesto ristotta. The pesto is made from pistachios, not pine nuts. It was creamy and delicious, especially with these sort of pickled onions on top that cut the creamy pesto and add a little crunch. My favorite part of the meal was the free bread and WHIPPED RICOTTA WITH OIL they give. I was literally eating the whipped ricotta with a spoon. Delicious.\\n\\nOverall our service was good- she wasn't hanging out by our table by any means, but she was attentive, came by enough we could get two rounds of drinks in HH, and brought out a free gelato flight as a surprise because she heard me talking about the fact it was my birthday. That was a great touch (and the gelatos were good, especially the peach). \\n\\nNow, everything was REALLY GOOD, but part of that is because we got it 50%. My review would change if it was full price, because the portions (and taste to a small degree) for the price, in my opinion, wouldn't match. $11 for an egg and polenta is a lot different than $5.50. This is why I say go for HH. The lower price point makes really good food that's overpriced just really good food. They could stand to touch up the decor and building a little, and I think they need to make it a bit clearer that the bar has it's own entrance upstairs and the restaurant entrance is a little weirdly on the side through the patio. But the patio looks nice for when it's cooler out and who doesn't love complimentary valet? \\n\\nI'll absolutely be back!!!

My visits yielded decent food and service.\\n\\nFirst of all, the menu is quite large! I definitely had to take a few minutes to look it over. Both times I visited I opted for a hearty meat dish. The pork carnitas tacos came unassembled with tortillas, onions, lettuce, and a dab of guac on the side. The meat was braised and chunky rather than shredded. It came with a decent amount of meat, which I was pleased with. On my second visit, I had the skirt steak (arrachera style). Like most skirt steaks, the meat was a little tough but it was very flavorful. The portion of meat and sides was a little small for the $18 price tag. My favorite was the guacamole, which was simple and delicious. My friend and I shared the appetizer and it was just enough for the two of us.\\n\\nThey redid the interior of the previous restaurant Stonewood with some cool stuff on the walls and fun lighting.

For years, it was Three Square which was great, and then they closed, wine bar tried to open there, failed and Gigi's.  So, my sister was in town and we decided to walk up for Sunday brunch.  The place was packed, people waiting outside in the rain, but we were seated rather quickly since we decided to sit at the bar area.  Here's the thing - no tipping - instead they add 20% to your bill to cover tip and employee benefits.  It seems to be something a lot of places are doing, so you are locked in - even if your service is not worth 20% you will pay - that may not sit well with some people.  And I think because of that, the service can be a little light at times, or maybe too sarcastic.  Our main server was a little too familiar and wasn't the best, but he wasn't the only person helping us.  Food is good - I had the eggs benedict that comes with potatoes and the smallest amount of greens.  I could of done without the potatoes and just greens because the potatoes were not good - just covered in cumin - and just not pleasing.  My sister had an egg dish, i can't remember exactly what, and was happy that they cooked her eggs just perfectly.  All in all, I like the place and would return.  They do give you sample of the waffles, which to most are probably desirable, but to us they were very heavy, almost like cake and not fluffy.  However, they were fresh and hot - so that's always a plus in my book."},{"name":"Meianna Bakery","address":"2850 SE 82nd Ave, Unit 27","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"There are so many things to choose from in the bakery.

I met with the owner who seemed very nice and very knowlegable and my cats seemed to like her. We were to meet at a later date for me to give her my keys and to finalize plans. Weeks went by and I heard nothing. My messages by phone and email were not returned and emails bounced back. She finally called me back in early December to state she was having surgery at which point I asked if she thought she could still pet sit.I told her my emails had bounced back and she told me she changed her email address (new one not listed on her website)  She stated she could still petsit. Another week went by and I emailed her to arrange key exchange and we set a tentative date. She stated she felt she could still petsit. The day after we agreed to meet she sent me an email stating that she could not physically do this and that she hoped I could make other arrangments. Now I am not an insensitive person and I truly understand that one must recover from surgery and if she physically could not do this then I know her health comes first. My main issue is that she is irresponsible in that she assured me she could do this, changed her email address without notification,  she confirmed a time to meet and the next day bailed on me leaving me to scramble to find arrangements to board my 2 cats for 6 days. I was unable to find another sitter at such short notice( 4 days before I am leaving) and called several kennels to no avail as they were fully booked for the holiday. I called the Boston Cat Hospital and they were able to accommodate me (I think they were full but my cat recently had a lot of care there so I think they created space). I am happy I found an alternative but I am now spending over $200 more than I planned to spend. Again, I am truly sorry the owner is having a tough time recuperating and I wish her a speedy recovery but she should have told me that she could not watch my cats long before this. She seems like a nice person but I think it was irresponsible to notify me one day after we agreed to meet to set things up.

I know it is the day before Thanksgiving and we too had to work, and finally got to break away for lunch at 2:15.    Starving no less, as we hadn't even had time for breakfast.  Our waitress (first time to encounter her) had the most dour response ever to our arrival.   We made a joke that we would each see who could possibly make her smile first.  Being that we had both been in similar waiting jobs over the course of the years (and he still in it), we made a mini competition out of it.  Alas, that didn't work.  It felt like she was pained to be there.  We offered up one of my $50 gift cards (people KNOW how much I love Epicerie) and she came back saying \\"we are not sure how much you may have left since we can't tell\\"....even though in blue on the back it said $50.00.  After asking if they could max out the card towards tip and the odd argument afterward, I just took the card and left a VERY NOT deserved $10 tip on a $44 tab.

Now I'll admit right now that I adore the owner--but I swear I didn't know him before our group started frequenting The Haven. We wanted to be accommodating to his regulars, so we held our event early--starting with a cocktail hour at 4PM and then with dinner from 5-7PM.  \\n\\nI organized and ticketed the event for my group and did up some lovely decorations (if I do say so myself) and he brought in the house bagpiper, Elias Alexander, to play for us as well, which is always a treat.\\n\\nWe had the run of the house and it was a very cozy, intimate get together where we all got to mix and mingle while enjoying drinks... meandering about and visiting with one another before dinner.  We were a large group for The Haven and were at maximum capacity. I will also add that when I ticketed the event, we sold out in under an hour and had a wait-list a mile long of people who wanted to come. \\n\\nWe pre-selected a choice of mains--Jason, the ownder, provided a great range of selection including Haggis with Tattie and Neeps, Vegetarian Shepherds Pie, Sassitch & Mash, Fish & Chips, and one I'd not tried previously, Chicken Rhumbledethumps which turned out to be a succulently juicy half chicken over a dressing of mashed potatoes with bits of cabbage and onion and I think some cheese... it also seemed to have some kind of crumb crust coating on it as well--it was DELICIOUS and I'd order it again without reservation.  There was also a light salad with watercress and a lovely light dressing--just enough to keep the dish from being too heavy. \\n\\nFor dessert we had choices of either Sticky Toffee Pudding (which I've greatly enjoyed on previous visits) or Cranachan, which was something I was curious to try. It is an intensely sweet treat made with a thick whipped cream mixed with honey, fresh tart raspberries and oats soaked in a bit of whisky.  It was delicious!\\n\\nThe starters were Scotch eggs (always delicious at The Haven), and some other things I didn't get to try as I was busy mingling with guests. It was great for the group to be able to sample a little bit of different Scottish cuisine that they'd been curious about for years. \\n\\nThe staff did a great job keeping up with a big group that all came in at once. The meals were served fresh from the kitchen and the pace was fine for our group who was happy to socialize while we waited for our dishes to arrive. Jason and his staff were attentive and accommodating to special requests and dietary substitutions needed. \\n\\nI feel very comfortable at The Haven.  Many people mentioned feeling like they were enjoying a meal as a guest in someone's home. It has a welcoming atmosphere--which is what I wanted my guests to experience. It was also nice to know my group was in good hands and I could step back and be more of a guest than I'd been at the rest of my weekends' many events. I finally got to talk with people and relax and enjoy myself, too!\\n\\nI would highly recommend this place for an intimate private event.

The plethora of these places keeps them all competitive, and the popular places do enough volume that they're getting fish nearly daily.\\n\\nIn any case, I was craving a lighter lunch, so sushi sounded decent, and since I was staying at the Hilton, walking over here was easy.\\n\\nDecor was light and modern - lots of light woods, light green Japanese style lanterns, translucent green plastic accents, little nooks upstairs and downstairs, etc.  There's a sushi bar (no seating), a counter you order from, and a hibachi style grill lining one wall.\\n\\nYou order at the counter, and they give you a number, and you sit and they bring out the food.  I ordered the sushi sampler B, which had salmon, shrimp, white fish, yellow tail, tuna, a spicy tuna roll, and miso soup.\\n\\nMiso was fine, and the sushi came out relatively quickly - long rectangular, stylish, modern white plate, with 5 pieces of nigiri at one end, a clump of white ginger, some thin wasabi paste that had come out of a cake-bag style tube, and the 8 pieces of the roll laid out 4x2 at the other end of the place.  Spicy tuna color was a bit bright and orange, rather than the deeper red I'm used to.\\n\\nI tried the shrimp first, and was immediately disappointed - rice was a gooey, sticky, gelatinous mess - to the point where it looked almost like a single mass, rather than a clump of individual grains, cool (as opposed to room temperature), and I couldn't taste any seasoning in the rice - no rice vinegar, sugar, etc.  \\n\\nThe other nigiri was definitely stuff that had been around a while, and didn't have that crisp, fresh texture and flavor I'm used to.\\n\\nRoll suffered due to the rice issues as well, and the spicy tuna wasn't really spicy.\\n\\nThe only saving grace for me was that they had Yuengling - I had forgotten they were distributing in Ohio now, and the last time I'd had one had probably been at least 5 years ago, so the beer was a nice little throw back.  \\n\\nOverall damage for the sampler, beer, and tip was $25.  A bit painful for the low quality of food.\\n\\nIn hindsight, when I saw bibimbop, kimchi fried rice, and sashimi with rice (a la Korean hwe dup bop,  akin to Japanese chirashi), I should probably have ordered something Korean, rather than a sushi sampler.  I noticed later the shirts have \\"Drink!\\" written on the back, with the Korean hangul characters there as well.  I'd say I'd try that next time I'm in here, but I see no reason to give them a second chance, especially as I'll be flying out in a few days anyway . . . \\n\\nWith all these signs of Korean ownership, I should probably have ordered a Korean style bento box, or one of the mixed rice bowls, which may not have suffered from the issues the sushi did."},{"name":"NY Bagel & Deli","address":"5001 Gateway Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We found this place by looking up on yelp for a breakfast.

It was fine, but tasted like a tea from Starbucks. Nope. \\n- Olives are normally one of my favorite foods, but these olives tasted as though they were marinated in white vinegar. Confusing.\\n- Patatas bravas are a dish I usually enjoy. The potatoes were dry and flavorless but the sauce was the worst part. I detected a fishy/meaty aspect that just tasted off and I couldn't eat more.\\n- Artichoke hearts are another one of my favorite foods. These were coated in what fried seafood is usually coated in; a thick, white, floury batter. I found this a curious choice, and had been expecting a darker, more textured coating, like breadcrumbs. Didn't love this but ate them all. They came with a mild dipping sauce that just tasted creamy.\\n- Finally, the quail. I've never had quail before so was not sure what to expect, but apparently quail are around the size of mice? Literally the smallest plate, and 70% bone. What was edible was delicious, and the sauce was divine. \\n\\nMy friend and I, after placing our initial order, had been expecting to order a few more plates.

They have everything from ramen & udon, to sashimi, grilled fish, Japanese curry, etc. A lot of homestyle foods. \\n\\nI ordered the sashimi deluxe dinner - 18 pieces of fresh fish that did not disappoint. They use different grades of fish depending on what you order. I had friends who got the chicken/beef and sashimi combo who didn't get as good cuts of fish as I did with just the full sashimi entree, but they still enjoyed it and got to taste a bit of everything they were craving. We didn't order any a la carte nigiri, but I feel like that would be even better quality fish.\\n\\nThe food was really good, extremely filling, and very well priced. For the 4 of us, the bill came out to only $91USD pre-tax. \\n\\nThe service here is polite and attentive, a standard you would expect from Japanese service. \\n\\nI had also ordered one grilled mackerel to go and they very neatly packed my order for me. The rice, fish, salad, and salad dressing were individually packed. For the soup, they gave me a cup with miso paste and told me how much hot water to add so that I could have hot fresh soup when I was ready to eat the order later on. Awesome service and attention to detail.\\n\\nBonus: There's even a Toto Japanese bidet in the bathroom! That's how you know this place is the real deal."},{"name":"Dante's","address":"350 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I've heard about this place forever, and I finally got a chance to see it when my friend invited me to a concert there. I've heard sketchy things about this place, so I really wasn't expecting much. Overall the layout is pretty sweet, enough space to walk around without feeling claustrophobic. The bar can get a bit crowded, but that's ok. Women's bathroom is a hot mess. Shows there are ok depending on whose playing but no issue with the sound so that was good. They have all different types of events here and even though the music I heard wasn't my cup of tea, people were pretty friendly."},{"name":"Bar Moxy","address":"240 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to this place on its opening night- October 4, 2019. This review only applies for the bar. \\nLocation: Right at the corner of Tremont Street and Stuart Street.  It's directly across the street from the W hotel- you can't miss the marquee from a few blocks away!!\\n\\nInterior: You can take the stairs to build up your thirst or just take an elevator. The bar is average size. It is really cute in there. Beautiful wood tables and lots of places to sit - at the bar or on couches or around tables. You can get a view of Boston or play some games!!\\n\\nDrinks: The drinks are akin to NYC prices yet depending on what you get they put it in a small coffee mug FULL of ice! (Thumbs down)  I didn't drink alcohol but I was told that some of the drinks need work. Don't know if that is attributed to the bartenders or just how they are trained to make drinks. Yes this is one of those bars that measure instead of free pour a drink. \\nSide note: The female bartender with the dark hair and olive complexion (perhaps Arabic or Greek) was super cool! I tipped her extra. \\nFood: The sausage was good as was the wings and margherita flatbread pizza. The main hang up with the food is that the kitchen closes early. It closes at 11pm because due to some MA law (allegedly) that the kitchen must close an hour before the bar. It didn't make sense to us since they were closing at 1am not 12am...\\nService: Our waitress was very attentive and nice. I didn't catch her name- she had semi curly hair and a number of tattoos on her hands/arms. \\nOverall: I want to come back and see how they fair in a few months. If I were Moxy Management, I'd definitely work the kinks out with the kitchen because people like to eat when it's late at night! Or maybe my friends and I are just greedy!!"},{"name":"Carrabba's Italian Grill","address":"11590 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to eat at the Carraba's when it was near Highland Mall and it was delicious.  It's been years though, since I've been to one and I was really looking forward to it.  We went to the one on Research Blvd.  \\n\\nAlas, methinks it has fallen the way of the overpriced chain restaurant.\\n\\nWe ordered the crab cakes appetizer.  The photo in the menu looked delicious, with big chunks of what looked like fresh crab.  Oh my, what a letdown.  The crab tasted like it came from a can, there were no large chunks, and the entire inside looked grey; nothing white or pink, just grey.  Although that roasted red pepper sauce that came with it was delicious, there wasn't enough of it on the plate to flavor the bland tasting and drab looking crab.\\n\\nThe house salad, which came with the meals we ordered, was abysmal.  Romaine lettuce and shredded carrots (I'm sure from a bag) smothered in a house Caesar dressing and three small olives.  OMG, what is wrong with restaurants nowadays?  If we had ordered the salads without the meal they'd have charged us $5 apiece, and they weren't worth $1.50.  \\n\\nWe each ordered a dish with shrimp and scallops.  One was the Champagne Shrimp and Scallop Linguine and the other was Spiedino de Mare.  The Speidino de Mare was better than the linguine, but neither was very good.  We think the Spiedino had four scallops and two shrimp, but it was really hard to tell.  The linguine came with lots of scallops and shrimp, but I'd rather have one or two really large fresh scallops, than 12 or more tiny ones that were each smaller than 4 nickels stacked on top of each other.  \\n\\nOnce again, the red flags were going off when we walked in the door but we ignored them.  (Oprah would tell me to pay attention to my gut!  I say once again because it has happened to me on more than one occasion).  It was a little after 12 on a Sunday and no one was there.  Where was the church crowd?  Lots of people go out for a good meal after church, but I guess they'd all figured out that the food at Carraba's was overpriced and not worth the effort.  \\n\\nOr maybe they just went up the street to Macaroni Grill.

Came during Happy Hour (until 7pm on weekdays) which gave us half off all drinks and bottles.  Really empty, so great opportunity to come here at almost dinner time and snag some good drinks prior to the 7pm cutoff.  Food menu small but offers smaller dishes to share.  Had the veggie gyoza, agedashi tofu, and the miso salmon.  Agedashi tofu was a full appetizer bowl with enoki and 2 fried tofu cubes.  Good, but needed a it more soup to help steep the tofu and deliver that mushiness as expected.  Same goes for the enoki which came raw and a needed that hot broth to heat up.  Good presentation, but lacked a little on the actual delivery.  Dumplings good but not great.  Came with 5 on a bed of cabbage.  Again presentation excels, and hit the right notes, but nothing to blow you away.  These were edamame full which is interesting, but didn't taste any different from a typical veggie dumpling.  The salmon was quite good.  For $20, you got a petite cut of salmon, kimchi and seaweed salad sides, and a mushroom soup.  Full bento-style meal that went heavy savory and sour.  Terrific dish all around and great sharable entree-level fish.  Little raw, so ask the chef to cook a bit longer if you prefer more than medium rare fish.  But very tasty and had a good charred skin that added to the overall punch of each bite.  A very edible plate, with nothing left when done.  Drinks are global, but nothing too out of the ordinary for beer or wine and no draught, all cans.  House cocktails seemed more Pacific-based without many whiskey forward options on house concoctions - not eve a Japanese old fashioned, surprisingly.  Some soju and baiju and tons of sake rounded out the drinks to again add to the need to come during Happy Hour or miss out.  Parking will be paid but easy to come by on 6th.  Service fine and free Wifi (no TV).  Interesting spot on the street to offer change of pace from dive bars and beer-focused spots on the street.  Again, would recommend coming for Happy Hour and getting slight small plates, and if really hungry, share the salmon."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This may be my favorite Habachi restaurant in Orlando.

Glad to see a little local business doing some affordable baguette sandwiches. I try to never order the European  style (aka ham n cheese, roast beef and the like on a croissant usually) as they aren't really any different than any other basic sandwich. First time I came in for lunch I had the chicken rosemary bahn mi and dining partner had bubble tea and a roasted pork bahn mi. The sandwiches needed a little more seasoning/veggies/cilantro,  but the meat was good. Crunchy baguette was the star - very crisp - but we ate it on site, so maybe they don't hold up of you take them to go. The pastry case didn't have a lot of variety, but I don't care for sweets. \\nBahn mi sandwiches run between $4 and European style more like $6. Bubble tea was $3.95 I think. I came back a few days later and had salad rolls - grilled chicken (3.75) which were tasty,  but you only get 2 smallis ones per order. The place by my work is $5 but you get about 2.5 times the quantity, and they seemed a little fresher. I came back today and had the veggie special salad rolls which were a big letdown.  Minced tofu with vege ham - both had a weird crumbly texture. Since I didn't like their peanut sauce (I'm moderately allergic to nuts ) I asked for a sauce substitute,  but they did not have one.

The view ahead was narrowed by tropical foliage and  several palms that had grown inward. Do we continue? I could barely make out what lie ahead, but I was able to make out dim lights, murmurs and other sounds of life, so we trudged on. \\n\\nHale Pele, Hale Pele, Hale Pele... What was that?\\n\\nA few more steps, the trees opened up and we emerged into a slightly sunken oasis filled with dim, smoky blue light, a tiki hut, and many friendly faces. I wasn't exactly sure how I'd gotten here, so I had to wonder how they had stumbled upon this place as well. \\n\\nHale Pele, Hale Pele, Hale Pele... I heard it again! \\n\\nA small native woman in a blue tube top emerged from the hut to greet us. She asked where we had come from and how many were traveling with us, then ushered us to a secondary secluded hut toward the end of this space, where we were seated at a large round table and presented with books containing colorfully customary cocktails. Everything on this menu had a strange and foreign name, a floral appearance, and seemed to be filled with a spirit called \\"Rum\\", in various forms. What is this \\"rum\\"? I'd only read of it in reports and research from times long gone. It is not a spirit in vogue where I am from, but when in Rome...or polynesia? \\n\\nWait, where am I again? Portland? More like Portlandesia I guess, and maybe a slight case of amnesia with that, as time and space seemed to become one blur, all the same. \\n\\nAnyway, I digress. We were particularly drawn to the communal beverages that occupied several pages of the book and came in a variety of large and colorful vessels. The native woman came back to take our order and we settled on the volcano bowl, a mix of rums, sugary juices and oddly flavored bitters, topped with a flaming lime. This culture clearly worships fire and head, because aside from the flames, beverages here can be ordered with varying levels of intensity. We played it safe at level 1, but we did sample a sip of a level 4, and all I can say is buyer beware! \\n\\nHale Pele, Hale Pele, Hale Pele ... There it was again! What is it? \\nThen I saw it. The volcano! It had erupted loudly as our beverage made its way from the other hut to our table! Hale Pele! I'm glad we chose the beverage that pays homage to such a powerful entity.\\n\\nOne mystery solved that leads right up to the next. See I'm not 100% sure what was in that beautiful looking beverage, but after a few sips everything became a blur. I remember uncontrollably laughing for quite some time, watching several members of my party engaging in some form of challenge involving long straws and attempts to sip from odd locations, and I recall an entire song being sung with only the words  Alex Lane. \\n\\nSomehow we made our way off Portlandesia and back to Portland, but how I will never know. A peculiar night indeed. One that will live on in my memories for a long while, for all of the right reasons. Go visit Hale Pele, and be sure to show your respect, for volcanos have a wrath with which you should not trifle."},{"name":"Rio Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"1122 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"I have to make a point of writing a review for Rio because it seems to have a terrible reputation and I cannot understand why?\\n\\nSure, it may not be the BEST Brazilian Steakhouse in the world but I can tell you it's definitely quite good.

I really, really was not missing much. The food was salty, salty, salty. I've been told I have a bit of a sensitivity to saltiness, but I have never experienced a meal that was pretty much spoiled because of it. \\n\\nWe came in for a late brunch, around 3pm, so the place was almost empty. Our server was very attentive, checking on us frequently (probably just a touch too frequently, but hey, I'd rather that than the opposite). I ordered the egg, cheese, and turkey sausage on an everything egg bagel and a side of hash browns. My SO ordered the open roast beef sandwich. The food didn't take as long as I thought it might to come out. \\n\\nAs I said earlier, everything was oversalted. A generous application of ketchup made the hash browns edible, although they were still kind of hard, as if they'd been sitting out a while. As for the sandwich, it was like I couldn't taste anything but salt. Toward the end of one half of the sandwich, I took it apart and just tried the egg, cheese, and sausage. There was immediately an improvement. I don't know if they coated the bagel in salt or what, but jeez. Even without the bagel, there wasn't much taste to the meal. I could taste the eggs, but the cheese and sausage were super bland. \\n\\nMy SO's roast beef was the least oversalted thing I tried. It was smothered in gravy, which tasted alright. The cole slaw it came with was also decent. I didn't touch the fries. He liked his food, but then, he is the type to salt his meal before he even tries it. \\n\\nThe worst part? Sorry if this is TMI, but my stomach started hurting a few minutes after we left. And then I had to cut our grocery trip short and rush home. Not pleasant at all.

Each of the Greater Good BBQ locations are a bit different. This location, which is in the space formerly occupied by Vintage Frozen Custard (https://goo.gl/rPFhsj), is primarily grab-and-go. The company's catering is also based out of this location. Due to the limited space, the kitchen only has one fryer, so menu items that are offered at the other locations aren't offered here. Examples include fried pickles, fried jalapenos, onion rings, and chili cheese fries. That's okay though because this place still has plenty to offer.\\n\\nI'm happy the Greater Good opened in my hood, but what's up with this space? I first knew it as LeRoy's Fried Chicken in June 2011 (https://goo.gl/oyGHH2). Then it became Curly's Fried Chicken (https://goo.gl/uwLUBi) before the year was over. Curly's closed and Ben's Brown Bag opened in its place in April 2013 (https://goo.gl/827iPS). Ben's Brown Bag lasted less than a year and in came Vintage Frozen Custard in March 2014. Vintage seemed to survive the longest. Hopefully, the Greater Good can buck this trend and stick around long-term. I'm rooting for them. They're a nice addition to the neighborhood.\\n\\nIf you've never been to this spot or any of its previous incarnations, it's a small building (pretty much like a trailer) with counter service. Parking and seating is limited. There are only four dedicated parking spots directly out front though I was told by the manager I could park, for free, behind La Fonda and in front of the attorney's office next door. In that case, there's plenty of parking.\\n\\nAs far as seating goes, it's all outdoor. The patio has five tables, most with four chairs each, and there are a couple stools at the counter. So seating capacity is approximately 20. There are three large retractable umbrellas for shade and cover. You grab your own condiments from the counter and bus your own table. The setup is fast and simple. I like it.\\n\\nThe menu is straightforward. They serve BBQ sandwiches, sliders, and tacos (about $8-11 each), smoked wings ($1 each), BBQ plates (about $11-16 each for most plates), a veggie plate ($8.95), Southern sides ($2.95 each), combo plates (about $16-26 each), pimento cheese potato skins with pork, chicken, or brisket (about $10-11 per serving), and pork, chicken, and brisket by the pound (about $14-18 per pound). The a la carte price per side ($2.95) wasn't listed on the menu during our visit so I had to ask.\\n\\nA variety of condiments are available next to the pick-up window. They include the Greater Good's barbecue sauces, Cholula Hot Sauce, Cajun Chef Tabasco Peppers (great on greens), and Heinz ketchup. There were four barbecue sauce options. They were: Carolina, hot, house, and sweet. The sweet sauce appeared to be the most popular as it was the one used the most.\\n\\nMy fiancee and I ordered:\\n\\n* Pitmaster ($25.95) - 4 meats, 2 sides\\n* Smoked wings ($1 each)\\n* Slaw ($2.95)\\n\\nOur meat selections for the Pitmaster combo were pulled pork, sliced brisket (you can also get it chopped), dry-rub ribs (you can also get them wet), and hot links. Our side selections were mac 'n cheese and collards. For two people, I think the Pitmaster provides a sufficient amount of food. We just ordered the wings and extra sides because we wanted to try more of the menu.\\n\\nOverall, we thought the food was good. I'm giving the barbecue 3.5 stars rounded up to 4. I do think the barbecue at other restaurants that have opened in the vicinity in the past few years, namely Das BBQ (December 2016) and 4 Rivers Smokehouse (July 2017), is better, but I'm still a fan of the Greater Good. We experienced great service and it's hard to beat the counter-serve convenience.\\n\\nI rank the meats as follows:\\n\\n1. Smoked wings\\n2. Sliced brisket\\n3. Dry-rub ribs\\n4. Hot links\\n5. Pulled pork\\n\\nThe wings were among the best I've had in town. They were crispy and juicy with a wonderful smokey flavor on the inside. The brisket, ribs, and links were very enjoyable. The pulled pork was disappointing. It was dry and lacked almost any sort of flavor. We were impressed with the portion sizes of each meat, particularly the ribs and links. The ribs weren't fall-off-the-bone, but they still had good consistency with a yummy, sugary flavor. The links, which were pork sausage, were served in bite-size slices. The brisket, served in long slices, had a thin smoke ring and a decent amount of both fatty and lean meat with delectable outer edges.\\n\\nI thought all of the barbecue sauces were tasty. They were all on the sweeter, tomato-based side. My favorite, by a hair, was the Carolina sauce. I'm not sure what it was made out of, but definitely not vinegar. Perhaps it was mustard-based, but it was hard for me to tell. All of the sauces were on the same red-to-brown color spectrum.\\n\\nThe sides were A-OK to good. The collards were my favorite. They were full of flavor. The mac 'n cheese tasted homemade."},{"name":"Emerald Lounge","address":"200 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Located in the center of Boston, by the theatre district in Revere Hotel, it is a perfect location.

They charge me $28 for the Korean BBQ, 3 people after tax is about $95. It is expensive, so I thought the foods and services would be good, but sadly, no. We came in around 11:30pm. There's only four tables and two waitresses.  We asked for Korean BBQ and ordered some steaks, beef brisket, pork belly, and rib steaks. \\n       Food came to our table after 10 minutes, along with water and hot tea.

I wish I hadn't. On my next (and last) two visits at dinner, the portions were cut in half, yet the prices had remained the same!

The venue itself has a really cool, intimate vibe with plush seating, glowing lamps, tealights, and is all around just a beautiful restaurant. There is even an outdoor patio portion with benches which looked incredibly cozy and fun! The only thing that really detracts from this vibe is the overly loud music which consumes the entire space and makes carry a conversation very challenging.\\n\\nI sat in the back of the restaurant, and although I was unaware that a reservation was necessary, they were able to accommodate me and my (assumed to be late) date. I waited for about 15 minutes before deciding he stood me up to go ahead and order, and during that time no one pressured me at all for not having him there. The staff seems to all work together to wait on guests, so anyone is able to put in an order for you. Everyone was incredibly friendly and kind.\\n\\nI ordered the scallops and was a little disappointed in the flavor. It seemed that there were pieces of the meal, such as the curry, which were tasty but the dish as a whole was disappointing and did not delight my tastebuds. Scallops in general tend to have a more mild flavor, so it's something that can easily underwhelm if not done well. I do wish I had ordered the salmon instead. \\n\\nOne of the wait staff also brought me a pineapple cocktail of some type to help me feel better about having been stood up (which was so incredibly thoughtful!!) and it was tasty, but not something I might have ordered myself. \\n\\nWhat really blew me away here was the Thai Coconut Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e which was quite a wait but absolutely worth it!

The mix of greens consists of shredded lettuce, cabbage, carrot, red bell pepper and cilantro. The house dressing is a balanced mix of tartness from vinegar and a tad of sweetness to offset the saltiness of the fish. It's hard to not compare this salad to the dedicated salad shops just further down in the Pru which provide greater volume and general heartiness, but it's different worth trying.

Most of the reviews are regarding brunch buffet or the restaurant week menu.**\\n\\nI came here for a special family occasion. I was extremely disappointed. I suggested to come here because I wanted to try a new Indian food place from Aab, Tadka, Amul, and other places I've been to. The first thing I have to say is that the service was terrible. The server kept walking away while people (my parents) were ordering and came off as annoyed with the party I was with. Yes we were a larger party of 7, but when you spend $360 at a restaurant I expect decent service.\\n\\nOn to the food. The appetizers were great and I thought, you know what as long as the food is this great who cares about the service. Unfortunately, as soon as the main course food was brought out that changed. I had SIX pieces of chicken in my chicken tiki masala. Yes I counted because I came hungry. The chicken was overcooked and the taste was nothing special. Second, all seven of us ordered a main course and they originally brought out ONE dish of rice to split. The size of maybe 3 cups of basmati rice. My father asked if rice came with our main dishes or if we had to order it, and the server explained he already had brought rice out and pointed to the small bowl of rice as if that was enough. We obviously ordered more which surprisingly he was quick to bring out.\\n\\nI realize that this place has great reviews, and that is honestly what drew me to eat here. However, I think that there are several other Indian restaurants that are more worth your time and money.

Immaculate tiki decor and exotica music. Fun theatrics for various drinks. Very friendly, knowledgeable staff.\\nExpansive cocktail menu that is gorgeously illustrated; this may be my favorite tiki bar menu yet. The drinks are a good mix of old and new. They have all my favorite classics, plus a couple I'm not familiar with, and a couple pages of originals. All the originals sounded delicious, but I do with they'd be a little bolder with their experimentation (though I understand it's a challenge to add additional ingredients to the bar).\\nIt being Black Tot Day, they had Painkiller and Navy Grog specials featuring Pusser's Gunpowder Proof rum, so we started with a round of Navy Grogs. Strong and spicy but not overly sweet, they were vastly superior to the last ones I'd had (at another great tiki bar in the east bay). For our next round we ordered a Ti' Punch (too much ice, but tart and delicious of course), Secret of the Lost Lagoon (slightly over-diluted, but deep and delicious), and La Isla Bonita. The last one tasted to me like melted rainbow sherbet, and though it improved slightly with the incorporation of the Campari float, they happily offered to make me a different drink (huge thanks!). The Tico Tico was bright and cachaca-forward with a hint of ginger.\\nThe food was also delicious. We shared the sesame salad, weebimbap, and fried rice. Best frikin fried rice I've ever had.

Sean B's review below almost mirrors my horrendous experience but he was more charitable in his 2 stars.  It was such a bizarre experience because I went there alone and waited to meet up with a girlfriend of mine.  I was there just over an hour by myself, had some happy hour food and a couple of drinks.  Bartender was really chatty and friendly; a heavy set, middle aged, brunette woman with glasses.  At one point she starts talking some mad crap about some customers and says snidely, \\"I can tell they are Yelpers\\" with utter disgust.  I'm in the industry myself and have no issues with \\"yelpers.\\"  However, if you're a really awful bartender, I can see how you would fear them and have disdain for them.  I didn't think much else about it until my girlfriend arrived.  This person is one of the sweetest women I've ever known in my entire life.  The bartender hated her instantly; she was condescending and vitriolic towards her from the first interaction.  At first, I just thought maybe I was perceiving this wrong but as the hour went along, I realized that this bartender is completely unhinged. \\n\\nWhen I had first arrived, I had asked a manager about rum flights and he said that they had a bunch of them in the $15 - $20 range.  When I mentioned that to the bartender after my friend had arrived, she was sneering at us and talking down to us, \\"Well, it depends on what you get,  most are in the $30-$35 range and all the way up to $50.\\"  Whoa, wtf?  I mentioned again the $15-$20 flights the manager had told me about and this ridiculous run around happened again.  And then again.  With her talking about these high priced flights and treating us like we were low life scum.  I finally told her that we weren't willing to spend more than $20 on a flight and she dramatically sighed and angrily put together our flight.  \\n\\nWe left shortly after and were so relieved to do so.  We both agreed that everything in there was amazing and we would return if it weren't for that psychotic nutcase.  My friend was so taken aback at being mistreated so badly.  I will never spend money to receive abuse like that.\\n\\nUNLESS YOU WANT TO BE ABUSED BY THE BARTENDER - AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

The server wasn't frequenting the table very often and there was a long wait for the food.  The whole visit took about 2 hours.  If you have time to meander, this is a great place to dine.

While we waited, a second worker did come in. I didn't note the time we ordered, but we finally got our order at 7:51 PM. It's counter service, so this is pretty slow. However, they were obviously short staffed that night, and were very apologetic about the wait. \\n\\nYelp has a check in deal for 1 free beer with purchase of laffa, but when I tried to use it they said they don't even serve alcohol. No biggie since it's not like we're entitled to it, I've just never come across such a discrepancy when it comes to check in deals. \\n\\nThe setup was a little confusing to me, since there's a \\"salad\\" bar that they use to put veggie fillings and sauces into the sandwiches, but I guess it's also self serve if you want to take anything in a little soup to go container that was near the cash register. I'm not sure if that's included with every purchase, but after a while I figured I waited long enough to deserve some hummus and tahini to go. I had asked for extra sauce on the side, and I'm not sure if I wasn't heard, or just ignored because it was supposed to be self serve anyways? I don't know. Anyways, I took some. And I didn't get yelled at, so it must've been OK. \\n\\nPargiyot Laffa $13.75: This is chicken. Chicken is not usually my preferred meat, but I wanted to try this as it seemed to be a specialty of theirs. It was OK, but I definitely preferred the kefta kebab. The way I would describe laffa is a big tortilla like thing but the texture of pita bread instead.\\n\\nKefta Kebab Laffa $14.75: I've had kefta kebab at other places, and this one seemed a little less juicy. We did take it to go, and it took some time for our whole order to be ready, so maybe it dried up a little since we didn't eat it right away?\\n\\nThe sandwiches were definitely filling, but for me I think it was just missing really awesome sauce. There wasn't a lot of tahini in the squeeze bottles so I wasn't able to get as much as I wanted. Their spicy sauce was really spicy, so only a tiny bit is needed for heat. I would've liked something more like a chili paste to add more flavor without being too hot. \\n\\n*****\\n\\nMy Star Ratings: \\n1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry. \\n2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return. \\n3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to. \\n4 Stars - Yummy!

My boyfriend and I used the Ikea Kitchen App to design our new kitchen. There were a few glitches in the program but it was more or less easy to figure out. The benefit to this program is it had everything Ikea had to offer regarding kitchen cabinets and all their options from pullout drawers to lazy susan cabinets to drawers inside drawers and more. Plenty of colour and design choices for your cabinets, handles, sizes - made our head spin. But we really had to give it to Philip and Vic from the Kitchen Department. Both of them were super knowledgable, patient and answered a ton of questions regarding our kitchen design and countertops (we must have been back and forth at Ikea 3-4 times). \\n\\nAfter we had our final kitchen design, luckily both Philip and Vic were there again to help us thoroughly look at our kitchen to make sure we had all the parts ordered and everything made sense and would be functional for our kitchen.

We got our orders in very quickly and I must say the value of the drinks are great. Let's start with the menu -- while you're waiting you can take a peek at it (pictures included!) and you can order in the waiting area. When we got seated I ordered a Lei Lani Volcano for $12 and it was so tasty. It isn't a blended drink but it was incredibly refreshing and more sweet than I thought it would be (great for weak drinkers like myself). I want to say the  cup was almost half the size of my head which was awesome. We got the munchies so we also ordered this Katsu dish for $10. It was also great for the value -- the plate came with katsu on rice with furikake, macaroni salad, and kimchi. \\n\\nOverall, my experience at Hale Pele was really enjoyable.

The service. The after-dinner conversation with Chef Fink. He did a crawfish dish so sublime, I was compelled to order another one immediately. And I seriously thought for a moment this restaurant was somehow designed by Volvo - all simple lines within elegant minimalism. \\n\\nHere's what made me tilt my head askew, like your dog sensing its first poltergeist: You're encouraged to order 2-3 small plates per person from the menu, which I get. But after you do that, they'll start your push-cart service, where a different server brings 4-5 off-menu small plates to your table. You pick & choose whatever you want, and whatever you select is added to your bill. 15-20 minutes later, the cart comes around again, with new & different dishes. And 15-20 minutes later, it's back. Here's the dilemma:\\n\\n1. Yeah, I get the Dim Sum connection, but we're talking substantial small plates here, not a trio of tiny wontons you can gulp without blinking. \\n2. I kept wondering how these random cart selections would disrupt the flow & timing of our original menu choices. I know that's not my problem. \\n3. It's hard to resist trying all the dishes from each cart pass. The presentations are remarkable. But it would have been way too much food. \\n4. I kept thinking, should I have picked that other plate instead of this one? Gosh darn it, did I just sabotage the entire experience? If I'm not totally blown away, isn't it actually my fault? \\n5. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to tip the cart server separately from our table server. Both Erin & Marsha spent quality time explaining every dish to us. I wound up leaving one big tip on my bill. Hope that worked. \\n\\nThe bottom line is restaurant time is my lazy time, and I don't want to have to think about what I'm doing. Especially at a fine dining establishment. I just want to be impressed. For my next Emmer & Rye visit, I'm going to sit at the counter facing the open kitchen, and politely ask: \\"Can y'all just make me your favorite dozen dishes?\\" Won't even question what they'll be, because I bet they'll all be great. \\n\\nFinal notes: Don't even come here without resos, this place is a current top-five Austin restaurant destination, and that's not going to change soon. Silly to fool with Rainey St parking at night, use the $10 valet. And apparently the brunch experience is different from dinner - for instance, the carts coming to your table are now filled with pastries. That just makes the process a whole lot easier.

To the guy who commented about the hot dog roll (lobster salad) above; welcome to New England! I think it's weird for fried clams, and wouldn't get a roll again, but now I know.

The atmosphere and decor was really nice and it was surprisingly a much bigger restaurant that I expected. I had saw online that they had happy hour from 4-6pm and they had specials on drink and food. I always love when happy hour has food on the menu, too. It took awhile for our waitress to stop by our table but I figured that's cause it was kind of busy (but not that bad) and because I was still waiting on someone else meeting me.\\n\\nOne thing that was disappointing was that our waitress did not tell us about happy hour or any of the specials. The second time she came back to our table, we finally had to ask her what the happy hour specials were and she told us the margaritas were only $4.50, which is a good deal, so that was great -- but she said there was no food on the happy hour menu, so I figured I must have read something that was from awhile ago online. She ended up coming back to our table after bringing out our drinks and said \\"I forgot we do have $2 off all appetizers for happy hour. I don't typically tell people, so I forgot.\\" That definitely took me by surprise, because you don't tell customers that you have food on your happy hour menu?\\n\\nWe ended up getting the Tijuana tostadas, queso dip, mini chipotle beef tacos, and taquitos that had braised beef. The beef and steak in the appetizers was really good, and the queso dip was alright. Our margaritas were pretty good but they were really sugary, so I suggest getting one of the unflavored margaritas if you don't like a lot of sugar in your drinks.\\n\\nI may give this place another try someday but I was pretty disappointed with my first experience from the customer service to some of the food and drink."},{"name":"Shabu & Mein","address":"148 1st St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went for dinner, and we went with shabu shabu. \\n\\nThe meat was so fresh and tender, the veggies were fresh and clean, and the broth was flavorful too.

The temperature of the oysters could have been colder. Sizes ranged from small to medium. While it was a nice attempt to have 3 homemade sauces the flavors didn't seem to match well with the oysters.

When we stepped in, we were overwhelmed by the various smells of tea along with the smell of chili!  We were greeted by the chef (who makes the food fresh daily!) and he educated us about the various types of tea (their website says they over 100 loose teas from around the world).  After smelling the various teas,Valerie decided to go with a Cranberry Apple tea since she likes fruity smelling teas.  I went with a chai tea and chose a Chocolate Chai tea.  They delivered the teas in a tall tea mug with the loose leaves of tea in a tea strainer ball.  (see picture below)  The chef told us to let it steep for a few minutes and then we could add half and half (this is the only milk product you can add to your tea at this place) and any other sugars/sweeteners/honey.  I thought my Chocolate Chai tea was just \\"okay\\" because I didn't care for the slighlty bitter aftertaste.  Valerie on the other hand, loved her Cranberry Apple tea!  \\nAfter an hour of yapping with one another, it was time to order lunch!  Valerie and I both ordered the \\"mixed plates\\"  which is a 1/2 soup/salad ,1/2 quesadilla/soup or 1/2 sandwich/quesadilla.  Both were $9.75.

Val ordered the 1/2 salad Roasted Curry Apricot Chicken and Tomato Bisque Soup.  Val thought the tomato bisque was delicious and she said \\"It tastes like homemade soup.\\"  Now, I do think that her chicken salad was the real star!

The first time I went I had the breakfast burrito. It was delicious and big enough to share. The flavors blend together well and the pico de gallo is flavorful, but not overpowering. The second time I went to Rocket, I brought my whole family. They happily accommodated our large group. My sister and I shared the open faced breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, tomato, and Gouda and the breakfast quesadilla. Both were amazing! Usually I prefer savory, but we wanted the lemon ricotta pancakes as a little dessert. Oh what a great choice; the lemon sauce was sweet but tangy! A perfect balance in my opinion. All of the menu items I've tried are wonderful! You can tell they make everything fresh daily and put a lot of thought and love into their food. Plus, everything is very reasonably priced.

I found the potato salad to lack flavor - to me, it tasted like potatoes covered in mayo and onions. The breading component of the broccoli and cheddar casserole was mushy and the broccoli was over cooked and bitter. The meat was disappointingly dry and lacked flavor. I found no smoky element or reservation of fat on the meat; it was just dry and bland. The sauce helped, but it had a strong vinegar flavor. Finishing off the meal was an admittedly tasty but very weak $13 cocktail. The service just regular, nothing special.

When I walked in looking a little lost, the cashier asked \\"is it your first time at Five Guys?\\" I admitted that yes, I was a Five Guys virgin, and the happy cashier explained the menu.  \\n\\nRegular burgers come with two patties, and little ones came with one, and you can enjoy get as many toppings I wanted for free.  I was somewhat overwhelmed by the choices of toppings, so I went with the \\"all the way'\\" (ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms).  \\n\\nThe results were impressive.  The meat patty on my cheese burger was think and tasty.  The toppings were yummy, oozing burgery goodness with every bight.  Maybe the bun was a little bit too soggy, but this did not detract from the burger experience overall. \\n\\nThe cajun fries were great.  My husband and I shared the small between the two of us   as the cashier suggested, and there were lots of fries to go around.  If you're heading to Five Guys alone, you'll probably find that the regular serving is too much for one person to eat.  Even by Texas standards. \\n\\nI'm giving Five Guys four stars and not five, because I don't love eating in a too-bright dining room.  It feels too fast-foody, but hey, this is a fast food joint.

Without exception, it has always been a fantastic experience. Tonight, Christmas eve dinner with my family, was different.\\n\\nThe cheese course was generally acceptable. However it took a very long time to get wine to go along with the cheese course. Six fine cheeses with Pellegrino, and having to ask for the honey comb accompaniments? No. \\n\\nEntr√©es were totally different matter - mixed bag. My children's dinners, and my wife's bisque, were quite good. My rack of lamb might as well have been a salt lick. It was basically inedible due to the amount of salt on it. Even worse, it was only four chops (Appetizer size - chef Adrienne's Vineyard in Miami offers a rack of 8 for less $, exquisitely seasoned and cooked). Wow. Although it was ultimately removed from the check, I take exception to the fact that a manager, who was sitting in the kitchen having a meal, didn't even bother to come by our table once. I sat enjoying my Meomi Pinot Noir while they ate. Ultimately, I remained hungry and disappointed. \\n\\nTime for dessert arrived. We had never been asked if we wanted souffl√©. Being after 10 PM, a wait of 30 minutes for a souffl√© would have been unacceptable to virtually anyone. It should have been offered, as it has been every time we've dined here before, when entr√©e orders were taken. Check, please.  \\n\\nThis was definitely not the steakhouse we are accustomed to dining at. One star for our server's demeanor, another star for my children's and wife's meals. Beyond that there was nothing memorable about this experience . In fact, for Christmas my wish, I wish  that I can forget this experience. Old Hickory, you can (and must) do better than this.

The sangria was fruity and watered down enough I would have let my kids drink it. The mood in the place was not super fun. \\n\\nThen we finally sat, already feeling not fabulous and saw the menu.

This ground zero of the Austin hipster population has certainly seen its full effect with the teardown after teardown of old rundown lots for the replacement of 3-4 story apartment complexes with 1st floor businesses on the sidewalk.  This change has become apparent as you hardly recognize familiar places.  On East 6th st near Comal St across the street from Zilker Brewing lies the new place opened in June 2018, Little Big Burger.   \\n\\nThis new location is server a menu of just burgers & fries and that is pretty much it.  Cheeseburger $5 comes with lettuce, pickles, diced onions and catsup.  You do have a selection of multiple cheeses to pick from so I actually went with blue cheese.  I added bacon on mine.  The burger is true to the advertising name.  It is a 1/4lb very round thick cut burger, so it is a small patty, but a round thick patty.   The burger is cooked medium, but next time I think I will ask for medium well.  Its just $2 extra if you are really hungry and want to make it a double.  Fries are $3 and I thought were kinda lackluster.  I know most places french fries are average and thats how I thought about these.  They offer a fry sauce which kinda tastes like a mixture of thousand island dressing and other ingredients.  Order at the register and cooking time is roughly 10 minutes.  They serve $2 Coca-Cola sodas, Dr Pepper and even some new flavors I have not seen before.  Seating is open, with several tables and then bar stools by the window.  Place is open very late including past Midnight on Friday & Saturday.\\n\\nI have tried a lot of different burgers in Austin.  I have a 3 tier ranking system.  Fast food, quality or gourmet burger.  Im actually going to rank this as a quality burger.  The beef certainly tastes fresh, but its round form and way they cook it make it a very juicy style burger.  The burger isnt that wide, but quite thick when you bite into it.  I did like the fresh toasted bun that it comes with.  Bacon was pretty good quality and thick cut.  I ordered blue cheese on mine and found it was an excellent flavor to go with.  You can also order a veggie burger, or get a regular burger in a lettuce wrap.  As I mentioned, if you are that hungry, a double at $2.00 extra will fill you up. I thought overall this was a pretty tasty burger that I would certainly order again.  I kinda like it only being a 1/4lb burger portion size.  There was nothing wrong with the fries, but since they were average, I would likely pass on them again.\\n\\nTheir location is in these new complexes, so you will have to take a short walk from your parking spot.  East 6th street area there is plenty of street parking if you try some of the crossover streets.  I thought the service was quite attentive and friendly.  The new venue is nicely kept and has good lighting during nighttime hours.  I think when more people living in this area realize this place you can get a good $5 burger late at night, more people will start to show up.   I will go back, but I just cant give this spot a 5 star rating.  It was certainly tasty, and I felt the price for the food was very respectable.  A good new addition to east 6th area."},{"name":"Backstage Atlanta","address":"2505 Godby Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Me and my Husband love this place .

Got a bad feeling and went to look at a menu. Turns out he placed an order for a tomato tart not the tomato burrata. Manager immediately came over and apologized. Sure, may have been a simple mistake however the bartender didn't even offer an apology or anything. The manager comped my burrata dish and was very accommodating.  However the lackadaisical attitude and careless nature of the bartender was very unsettling - like my stomach which has left me throwing up for the past hour. Very VERY disappointing.

On that visit I only had dessert, but I enjoyed it, the guy behind the counter was really nice too and there are a number of food options I was interested in coming back to try. I absolutely love a great croque madam and authentic French macaroons so they were first on my list for my return.\\n\\nMy second visit was a few weeks ago and could have easily ended up with a 1 star rating. Here's what happened and why it's not:\\n\\nI came for Sunday brunch about 20 mins after they opened and was quickly seated outside. I was hungry and had somewhere to be after, I ordered the croque madam and an espresso upon being seated. I enjoyed the espresso; it was pretty good. As I sipped on my espresso I was taking in and enjoying the atmosphere which is clean, classy, and almost French farmhouseesque. With the many choices of cheeses and wines to choose from. I could see people making extended stays here. Unfortunately my visit was a tad longer than originally planned.\\n\\nIt took over 50 minutes for my food to arrive. To my waitress's credit, she did come to me multiple times and apologize for it taking so long and kept telling me it should be right out. At the 20 minute mark I wasn't worried at all, even after 30 minutes. While that still is a lot of time since ordering, I don't expect really fast service at any brunch place in Austin. While I don't like it, waiting seems to be the new culture here and I do not think it is because the food takes so long to prepare. Yet after 40 minutes, I was not too happy and really felt that was ridiculous. I asked my waitress if it was going to be out soon, because if not I needed to leave. She assured me it would be any minute and it was maybe another 10 or more so minutes before it finally did. And then it came and to my surprise it was lukewarm and on the verge of being cold. Strangely, the fries were piping hot.\\n\\nI barely ate it because, it wasn't very good (maybe due to it being lukewarm) and I was rather annoyed at that point. My waitress offered a free cookie to which I asked what macaroons they had, but unfortunately they were out of them that day. I declined the cookie and went to the host to ask for the manager. He said to me \\"we're really busy right now\\" to which I replied \\"ok, I understand, but I just had an awful experience and would really like to speak with the manager.\\" Seemingly annoyed that I insisted on speaking with the manager, he went to get her. Chole, the manager, came out a few minutes after and was extremely nice and comped my bill before I even had the chance to tell her what happened (great move and excellent customer service on her part). I explained briefly what happened and simply asked if this is a normal experience. She said not at all and that apparently they were short a cook that day and she sincerely apologized.\\n\\nLook, I'm not perfect, I never will be. I make mistakes and will in the future too, we all make mistakes. It is not the mistake that matters to me necessarily, but what I or others do after the mistakes. Chloe saved me as a customer by simply acknowledging my experience, showing genuine concern over it, by putting their money where their mouth is and standing by the level of service I imagine they wish to provide.\\n\\nAnd, they still gave me a free cookie which was really good and probably the most chocolate filled chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.

Walking in, you can tell some cared A LOT about this place once upon a time. The decor is over-the-top but worn down, poorly maintained, and dingy. There was trash all over the floor in front of the hostess desk. Place was deserted on a Thursday night.\\n\\nNonetheless, my partner and I felt like giving them a chance. We ordered from the combination dinner menu to keep it simple. The meals come with egg drop (or hot and sour) soup which was OK. I have had better but this was not horrible (their soup does use canned mushrooms which is a big \\"ew\\" in my book).\\n\\nThe entrees came out and looked pretty OK. Generous portions. My partner's dinner was crab rangoon + shrimp with lobster sauce + fried rice. Mine was hong sue gai (fried chicken with vegetables) + beef teriyaki + fried rice. She ate the crab rangoons ... meh. Again, not the worst ever. I bit into a chicken finger and the chicken was so dry it pulled completely out of the breading when I bit into it - yep, brown and dried out on the inside. The rice was pretty tasty.\\n\\nThen, my partner took a bite of shrimp and that's when the meal officially turned the corner. The shrimp was bad/spoiled. She spit it out, called the waitress over, and let her know - sending her meal back. I ate a few more bites and then asked for a box and a check so we could head out. My partner left the table to experience her \\"reversal of fortune\\" in the bathroom. When she came back, we got the check and had been fully charged for her meal.\\n\\nWhen she asked our waitress about it, the waitress said she'd check with the manager. The waitress came back with a revised check ... charging us $3.75 for a crab rangoon appetizer (mind you, the meal only came with 2 of them) instead of just comping the meal. WTF?!? Who does that?!!? We paid near exact change (no tip) and left.\\n\\nWhen we got home I was still hungry so I bit into a beef teriyaki. It tasted sour, like vinegar. Like it was either spoiled or someone had tried to soak older meat in vinegar before cooking it to pass it off as fresh. I, too, spent the rest of the night nauseated. I've eaten Chinese food at least once per week my whole life (almost 40 years) ... I've eaten plenty of mediocre Chinese food. This is not that. This is BAD NEWS. I have NEVER gotten sick from Chinese food. NEVER. This was a first. And I've certainly NEVER been charged A PENNY for a meal that contained expired/rotten food.\\n\\nOn our way out we saw that \\"karaoke night\\" was one woman standing in a corner of the bar area, reading the karaoke screen.

The cheese that comes with the pretzel order tasted disgusting and watered down like they had added water or something to it, definitely was not how it's supposed to be. The wings and fries came out cold per usual. They brought my boyfriend and I our drinks and then took an additional 10 minutes to bring my son his chocolate milk. After this visit I am done. It's very unfortunate because I'm a huge fan of the chain but I cannot tolerate the lack of customer service as a previous server anymore. I always try to be very understanding but in this situation I believe it is simply extremely poor management because it's literally every single server that works in the place and there's no exception as to why tables are waiting 10 and 15  minutes to be greeted when the servers are walking around talking to each other making jokes"},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"The chips and salsa they start you out with are pretty delicious. The chips have some lime seasoning on them and the salsa is just a bit spicy. We went during happy hour and ordered food off of that menu. \\n\\nI got 2 tacos - each being $3 during happy hour. The grilled fish taco I got was actually really good, but beware that it is pretty spicy. I can handle spice, but that definitely had a kick to it. The chicken taco I got was just ok...the chicken itself was great, but the taco as a whole did not have a ton of flavor. My friend ordered a few things off the happy hour menu as well, and was a bit surprised by the very small portion that came out. The happy hour chicken enchilada was $5 but was a tiny little thing. The ahi poke tostada was $6 and was even smaller. Just something to be aware of if you decide to order off the happy hour menu.

The fellow at reception seemed more interested in chatting with staff and attending to his cellphone than customer service.  While I waited I got a terrific drink of mezcal, green chartreuse and habanero brine from attentive bartenders.  And then I was very happy with my waiter, who was knowledgeable and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the food was not consistently wonderful. The richness of the peach and lardo dish was nicely balanced with the bite of red onion although more than a bit too heavy on sesame seeds, and it should be mentioned that the peaches were not consistently heated, so some pieces were not as succulent as others.  The lamb tartare with a ras el hanout sabayon was delicious, though it would have made sense to serve it with some sort of cracker or bread to balance the texture of the raw meat (I wasn't persuaded by the comment of the server that the mustang grapes and pickled fennel, though adding lovely flavor and crunch, sufficed).  The real disappointment, however, were the pastas.  i initially opted for the tajarin, but the cornstarchy sauce made it unpleasant eating.  The waiter was kind enough to replace it with a cacio e pepe, but although the pasta was perfectly cooked, it too had a kind of gloppy sauce that detracted from the lovely texture of the pasta. I ordinarily love cacio e pepe, and was very disappointed with this version.  The only other thing I'll say about the food is that the custard in the tart, although delicious, was not set, and would be better characterized as a puddle than a pudding. Again, my waiter was great and the flavors were lovely, but the execution was unfortunately inconsistent and textures a bit unbalanced.

Why hire a hostess if your guests are not going to be properly greeted? This is very unprofessional and a poor reflection on this establishments management. As we as the hostesses unfriendly, rude, and dismissive demeanor towards guests did not enrich our experience. When the hostess finally seated us after an hour of waiting, the table was still dirty!

My aunt had the shrimp penne, which contained a large amount of penne, but very few shrimp and very little sauce, despite being one of the pricier options on the menu.  The kids had chicken tenders (which were fine, and they appreciated that they could order grapes and applesauce as sides, instead of the usual fries), and my husband and I had Cobb salads, which were huge and beautifully presented, although I was disappointed that I was unable to order one without meat.  (The Cobb salad was offered with either shrimp or turkey, and I was told that even if I ordered it as a vegetarian or vegan salad with many of the components omitted, I'd still be charged the \\"turkey price,\\" which struck me as a bit unreasonable, given that the $3.50 upcharge for the shrimp version made it clear that the menu price relied heavily on the cost of your protein.)

We are very lucky, we are close to some of the best restaurants in the city.  But this month, we decided to go somewhere out of our area (we are close to Gastown and Yaletown) and try something different.  Let's just say, we should stick to what we know!  We received the worst service EVER.  The woman who \\"greeted\\" us, had a straight face on (looked like she was having a bad day, angry face) without a smile (she never ever once smiled at all during our time there at lunch) while she went around the table to fill our glasses with water.  While filling our glasses, we tried to ask questions about the menu and substitutions (we have 2 vegetarians at our table) but we were answered back with clear annoyance and one worded answers.  When the food arrived, it looked delicious but unfortunately, I can't even say how I feel about the pasta because the service left such a bitter taste in my mouth; I barely touched my dish.  While some of us were still finishing up our lunch, she kept coming back to clear the table and in some cases, taking a dish away before we were finished.  One of my colleagues felt intimated and didn't want to ask her any more questions or stop her from removing her plate because she seemed like we were inconveniencing her by sitting here.  During what should be a busy lunch hour (this place in on Robson/Thurlow - a pretty busy corner in the downtown core) was empty and we didn't understand why or the need to be so rude or blunt with us.  In a city where there area abundance of great restaurants, I am not sure how this one is surviving.  We will not be returning again and I do not recommend coming here.  The only time we received a smile was from the owner, Franco when he arrived with the bill.  Now I understand why the service was so lacking, we were charged a mandatory 18% put on our bill because we had a group of 6.  REALLY?  Because we would have begrudgingly given 10% or 0% for the lack of service.  My boss didn't want to argue and we were done with this place.  This was the quickest colleague monthly luncheon we have ever had.  Because of the service, I didn't trust her to pack up my barely touched my lunch instead I asked (repeatedly) for a take out box.  She also cleared my spoon before I had a chance to scoop my pasta in the take out box so I had to use the knife to scrape the leftovers into the box.  Feeling rushed as she was hovering over me as I tried to scrape as quickly as I could with a KNIFE into the box.

Don't get confused though, this will be about \\"Canton Cook II\\". Not sure what the full story is, but Canton Cook II is the one you want to go eat at. \\n\\nAnyway, Canton Cook II is yet another solid place to eat at in an area that has plenty of great options. Sandy Springs has no shortage of good food, but this will probably be your go to for Chinese food. It's located in the big shopping center with the LA Fitness and Nori Nori, so parking should almost never been an issue when you get here.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty casual with plenty of booths and several big round tables that can probably sit up to ten people. I usually see a couple of relatively large parties when I eat here as this place is perfect for family style dining. As with most Chinese menus, there are plenty of options available, some more expensive than others. \\n\\nAs far as what to order, I usually start with wonton soup. The wontons itself are really tasty and the broth is well flavored. For many good reasons, you'll see plenty of reviews mention for what's officially called spicy salted squid on the menu, but I've always known it as the salt and pepper squid. It's definitely well seasoned and cooked to the right amount of crispiness - it's probably my favorite dish on the menu. In addition, the sea bass steak is definitely one of the dishes to consider. I usually see it priced on the receipt at just under 30 bucks, so it is a bit pricey; however, it's absolutely delicious. \\n\\nThe only reason it doesn't get a 5/5 is that the service here in my personal experience, which has been ten or so separate occasions, can be good or can be pretty dismal. Sometimes the food comes out quickly and drinks are never empty, other times it's the complete opposite. I haven't noticed much of a pattern and seems to be random.

My husband isn't a picky eater, he's more of a I'll eat whatever you give me, I eat to live type of guy and give people the benefit of the doubt and he was saying we are just going to walk out if they don't hurry it up, he also hated the food which is unusual because he lives the places that give me food posioning. The shabu shavu everyone says they ordered is a tad expensive coming out to $40 because you have to purchase 2, and even when the waitress made it for a table near us it smelt burnt the entirety of the time we were there.

The music selection on other nights is bleh, but inside you are not consumed with it.  However, outside the music is loud enough as if they were trying to cover the noise of traffic on the street with trendy pop music.  However, the noise is not bad and is not an interrupter.  \\n\\nThe food is great, atmosphere is trendy but nice enough that you can wear jeans with a nicer shirt but if you wanted to dress up you would feel comfortable as well.

Further, my husband and I are pretty decent cooks and even more avid consumers of excellent food around town. We've visited Renata at least 15 times (most frequently at the bar) and while the culinary experience is variable depending on the menu and kitchen staff, the service is usually very personable. Tonight was unique in that we walked into an empty bar (we were the only patrons seated there) and the restaurant held no more than 5 seated tables at any given time, yet the bartender made it painstakingly clear that we were not any matter of priority even when he had nothing else to do. When we were the first (and only) customers, Matthew was accommodating (though slow) and made some beautiful pasta recommendations. I ordered the Creste di Gallo which was described as having roasted duck, brown butter, and sage. Upon delivery, the pasta was under-salted, lacking in any suggestion of brown butter or sage, and mostly flavorless. We asked Matthew for some salt and he asked if it helped, at which point I acknowledged I had made a poor choice and asked for our standby, Cacio e Pepe. By our impression, the kitchen had nothing better to do than to make a more flavorful dish, but we didn't have an opportunity to ask because 20 minutes later we hadn't received the second glass of wine I ordered nor the pasta, then Matthew offered us the check. It appeared the delay was due to him preferring to serve 3 off-duty staff members at the end of the bar.  I hope this was a one-off, but since our experience at Renata has been relatively expensive and inconsistent compared to other Italian restaurants we love to frequent in Portland, we likely won't return.

The tonkotsu broth was not as rich and creamy as I was hoping it would be. It was very but it wasn't the worst ramen I've ever had. My dad got a chashu ramen I think with a tonkotsu broth and it was crazy. The cuts of port was very thick and was sooo tender. I don't think I've ever had pork this tender but it did have quite a bit of fat so be aware of that. I also tried the rice bowl my brother ordered and it was by far my least favourite. He ordered the beef, corn and rice bowl and it was so heavy. It had such a strong dairy flavour from the top layer of cheese and also the beef. The little sides that came with it helped cut the greasiness but it was still overwhelming. I don't think we would order it again.
