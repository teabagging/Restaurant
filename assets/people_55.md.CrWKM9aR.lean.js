Not really.\\n\\nThe cannolis are very sweet.   One ten year-old kid next to us said that it was like eating frosting.  Way too sweet for most people.  Definitely one of those tourist urban legends that are over-rated.  Mike's charges three bucks for their cannolis, while Modern charges two-fifty.  I could have spent the hour-long wait doing something more constructive.  \\n\\nOne hint tho, just sit down at one of the tables and get served.  It's not any different cost-wise except for the tip.  There is typically no line for the dine-in tables.  It really makes no sense why tourists wait in line for their cannolis and then eat them on the street.  You've been standing in line for almost an hour, why not just sit down and eat in the establishment instead??  I didn't find this out until we got to Modern.\\n\\nBeing from SF, I really should have known about the hype over reality factor, but I fell into the trap.  Oh well.\\n\\nI have to admit, Mike's does a great job of advertising.

These public events are nontraditional eating experiences, but are super fun if you know what to expect!\\n\\nTaco Tuesdays -- a must do! We live within just a couple of blocks of The Kitchen and I'm not sure we'll ever eat at home on Tuesdays again (plus with Tapas Tuesdays nearby at Sidebar... I'm happy just switching off between the two). Each week there's a new \\"theme\\" for the tacos. Last night it was \\"Rainbow\\" in celebration of Pride; there was a taco creation for each of the ROYGBIV colors. I had me some RED (roasted beets, goat cheese, walnuts), ORANGE (Moroccan lamb with a carrot salad/slaw), and BLUE (pulled pork with blueberry salsa). Totally impressed! You get to pick corn or flour tortillas. Super delicious, and all tacos were either $3 or $4. \\n\\nCommunal tables, fast-casual style where you order at a counter,  get a number, and then a runner brings your food. Beer, wine, and some cocktails available -- beers by the small or large pitcher! Local brews! \\n\\nThere was another little stand going on in here, a dude selling smoothies that get blended on the back of his bike. It was outfitted with a Vitamix powered by stationary peddling. I don't know how regularly this is a feature -- perhaps The Kitchen rotates highlighting these different small concepts here. \\n\\nI've heard of their brunch + yoga events and can't wait to come try. I'll be looking to host a special group private event in the future. \\n\\nI dig the decor, I dig the concept. I think they're evolving into what the community needs it to be, and that may take some time. I love having this option nearby.\\n\\nThere are a couple of things that could be improved, though:\\n\\n- Really loud! The music + acoustics of people chattering around us made conversation really difficult. We weren't inclined to linger. I love the festive atmosphere but there needs to be some kind of sound-absorbtion efforts made. I want to bring my parents here, but I know they would just complain about the sound levels. The music when we went was a lot of Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears (which I personally LOVE!) but didn't match the vibe. \\n\\n- Paper/plastic tableware. I think the taco bowls were recycled sturdy paper, lined with foil, which I guess I don't mind. But, the forks were plastic, napkins were paper (though I will admit they were high-end and sturdy as paper napkins go). So easy to have metal forks and maybe some tea-towel cloth napkins?

It gets so packed but you can always find a table. It does get a little frantic but they are so quick to serve you. I see people from all over come here to order their banh mi and noodle soup. That's how you know it's good. It's not just a place for Asians to eat, everyone seems to love it. I've tried the different types of banh mi from here before but I always go back to the grilled pork. It's the only one that I can confidently order and finish within minutes, it's really good! Their noodle soup is good, but I've had better elsewhere. I only visit Lee's when I want a grilled pork banh mi. They have the combo (half banh mi and bowl of noodle soup) special which is the perfect amount for lunch. I have also tried their eggrolls before. The first time, I thought it was delicious. Maybe I was just really hungry. The second time, I didn't like it. They also sell baguettes, freshly baked. I've bought one before to make sandwiches at home and it's very good. I haven't really \\"loved\\" everything on the menu but they're still good. Despite that, the grilled pork banh mi itself is enough to keep me going back for food. Keep in mind that the banh mi is not meant to be eaten hours later though. I bought one to take home once and it was very hard to chew the banh mi hours later."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"After an unsatisfying meal the previous night, we were ready for something awesome and Ev suggested this place.

I'm in some ways skeptical about places that get  many reviews for one because the prices might be outrageous or the menu will have something extraordinary that it might get too \\"fancy\\". Anywho we started off the the bloody mary's and we settled on: I got mike's special scramble and although Ev wanted the same thing but we have a rule of not ordering the same thing, he got the pork apple sausage scramble. First off you know you're in for a treat if their bloody mary is amazing!! Probably the best I've ever had! It was subtle and just the right amount of everything, as if they took time to make it or at least the mix if it was. Now for the meals, let me tell you that combination prosciutto with the garlic with the egg= perfection!!! That bite kept melting in my mouth and I felt so bad when Ev tasted mine because I wasn't willing to share after his bite. Not to say his meal sucked but it wasn't like mine.

Cups and plates were very dirty..."},{"name":"Capozzi's Decatur","address":"1355 Clairmont Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"Pleasantly surprised to have found Capozzi's.  If you're looking for good Italian food, but don't want to go to an upscale restaurant or a chain, Capozzi's fits the bill.  It's an authentic yet casual Italian eatery located next to the Nest, Bhojanic, Community Q, Pyng Ho, and Athens Pizza House.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a rustic but elegant look and feel to it.  The entrance leads you into the main dining room which is a large open space.  Booths run down either side with tables in the middle.  One of the walls is brick, which goes along with the exposed ductwork above.  Vintage chandeliers, light fixtures, artwork, and early 20th century music give this place a lovely retro vibe.  Aside from the large dining area, there's also a separate room with bar and TV, outdoor patio in front, and bocce ball court outside in the back.\\n\\nCapozzi's menu consists of salads, heros (Italian sub sandwiches), parmigiana, ziti, pastas, and pizzas.  Most of the entrees will set you back at least $10-15 per.  Whole specialty pizzas are more expensive, though you can order by the slice in both Neapolitan and Sicilian styles.  They've also got an all-you-can-eat Italian lunch special weekdays for $9.50.  Good deal.\\n\\nI came here for a Monday night dinner (the restaurant was maybe 1/3 full) and tried the following:\\n\\nStarter:\\nFried Artichokes served with housemade garlic-lemon-thyme dressing and marinara\\n\\nPastas:\\nMushroom Linguini (+ Sausage) - fresh sauteed mushrooms cooked in tomato sauce\\nAglio e Olio (Garlic and Oil) Tortellini (+ Grilled Chicken) - fresh slices of garlic sauteed golden brown in olive oil\\n\\nI'm not sure exactly how fresh the ingredients are, but in general, everything seemed A-OK.\\n\\nThe Fried Artichokes came with two dipping sauces.  The artichokes were lightly battered and fried, almost like Japanese tempura.  One of the sauces was a housemade dressing, one of several the restaurant makes.  It made this zesty dish even zestier.  Not a bad app, but I grew tired of it after a handful of bites.  Artichokes weren't overcooked so the insides were still soft, juicy, and strong in flavor.\\n\\nBoth pastas were cooked al dente and came with slices of bread.  I preferred the Tortellini over the Linguini for a couple reasons: (1) I enjoyed the tortellini's smooth texture better and (2) I liked the garlic, oil, and pesto combo over the tomato sauce.  The Mushroom Linguini came with plenty of sliced mushrooms and the Italian sausage was sliced into small pieces.\\n\\nI thought the Aglio e Olio was pretty good.  I love freshly chopped/sliced garlic.  The chicken came with pesto on top, which was a nice addition.  Chicken breast was grilled and taste wasn't all that great, but the tortellini made up for it.  The pasta dishes here are quite filling and chances are you'll have leftovers, especially if you order some starters.\\n\\nThe staff at Capozzi's are friendly and inviting.  The dry-witted Heather S. was our server and she did an outstanding job.\\n\\nBusy parking lot, but you shouldn't have a problem finding a spot."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"As a traveller walking down the street looking at all of these white boxes passing by, I was excited to try Mikes.

They have their standard menu, which you can find online, but pay special attention to the chalkboard behind the counter when you walk in. There are LOTS of specials on there. Additionally, I've found that they will pretty much make you anything you want here. You can call and say, \\"Can I have a beef and veggie dish, with noodles, and can you make that spicy?\\" and they will say \\"OK!\\" Everything is made fresh to order, so they can alter their dishes to your liking. Huge +1 for that. \\n\\nThe staff has remained small, but consistent. Super pleasant, great phone manners, excellent service, and very polite! \\n\\nAs others have mentioned, this is a cash-only establishment.

The guac was a shareable portion, fresh and tasty and served with freshly made tortilla chips. My guest and I both ended up ordering steak and chicken (not on the menu, but can still order) combo fajitas. Elliot explained to us that the chicken is brined and marinated, the refried beans cook all day and the rice is freshly prepared Spanish rice..oh and the tortillas are hand made! Well, the food came out sizzling in no time! A hot skillet of the MOST tender chicken and skirt steak I have had! The peppers and onions were grilled to perfection! Our rice and beans (a pretty good serving came out, hot and fresh)...the gold that accompanied my fajitas was the Mexican butter! OMG, it was amazing! I drizzled it over my fajitas and immediately assembled them, topping them off with the finely diced pico!

We just got back from Santa Fe and loaded up on authentic NM stye cuisine and this was even better (Chef Hosea is from NM, so makes sense.) We had heard of some not-so-great hostess and waiter service leading up to our first time and I can honestly say that they must have fixed some internal issues early on, because we had a very memorable experience from start to finish. The interior is cozy and sophisticated (for being in a strip mall) and some of the touches, like the New Mexico flag branded as the chandelier was insanely cool. Good \\"sit at the bar\\" spot too if that's your sorta thing or are traveling alone on a business trip but want a lively Boulder dining experience. \\n\\nAs for Apps, our table ordered almost all of them: The guac was on the small side but very satisfying - but the QUESO was unreal. As someone who really dislikes anything with goat cheese, it still knocked my socks off. I recommend sharing this with a table for a filling app. The chile rellenos were a bit disappointing I will say - the breading made them almost flavorless and the cheddar filling was very \\"meh.\\" I would go back for just apps and margs alone. \\n\\nFor entrees, we ordered multiple things and shared. Our favorite BY FAR was the Wood Oven Half Chicken. We also loved the Red Chile Posole - it was so hearty and had great textures. Believe it or not, the Enchiladas (chicken) were the least memorable for us all. They were good... but other items were just better and stood out more.\\n\\nUPDATE per my second visit: \\nHappy Hour: Decent food options and great drink deals. The Chicken and Pork Tacos, as well as the Frito pie are UNREAL! Very well done. However, I felt like my Happy Hour drinks were watered down... not sure about that. Also, our waiter forgot our 2nd order we placed completely - we had to remind her 25 minutes later. No apology or making it right on our bill. Customer service felt pretty weak in that moment. \\n\\nBreakfast Burrito Review: Good, but Centro's still win best BB in town by a landslide.

I had no idea that it was a type of food...I thought it was just a family that owned all of the food spots in the area.  I finally asked one of my friends and they told me it was soup! I felt kinda dumb...but hey thats life.  Since I missed my chance to try it out there, I decided to finally see what this soup is about.\\n\\nAccording to my Yelp peeps...this place had great Pho and also one great tasting sandwich.  I decided to venture out one Sunday afternoon, thinking ok...everyone should be home cooking with their families and this place shouldn't be so busy.  Man was I wrong.  I walk in to order and I hear a woman complaining, saying that she's been there for 45 minutes, waiting on just two sandwiches.  When I got to the counter, the lady informed me that it would be at least an hour wait. I made an about face, headed for my VW and was outta there.  A week later, I said ok lets try this again, this time at a later time and hope for the best.\\n\\nI was finally successful getting my Pho and sandwich (30 min wait).  I can't compare Pho since this was my first time, but I can say that it was delicious. The well-done flank steak soaks up the soup well and the herbs bring a unique freshness to the soup. The noodles were tender and stuck together, making it easy to be picked up by chopsticks.  It was so much soup that I had to save it for another day.\\n\\nThe pork sandwich was amazing. I heard complaints that they don't put enough meat in their sandwiches.  I think it was just enough, since they carry the name Bakery, I would be lead to believe that they are highlighting their bread as the main component. Really fresh bread, and the herbs, cucumber, and carrots give a different dimension, instead of the conventional lettuce and tomato.\\n\\nNext time I go...I will definitely call ahead and order, cuz who wants to wait 30 minutes after driving almost 30 min to get there?

On the South Shore? Yes, please, and pass the Crystal Hot Sauce!

They had been open 12 days so far, so maybe the crowds just didn't know about the place yet. \\n\\nMore of a concern was the fact that every table had Tabasco, and not Crystal hot sauce. Now, nothing against Tabasco, but anyone who has ever been in Cajun/Creole country knows that Crystal is the stuff on every restaurant and kitchen table, from East Texas to the Florida Panhandle. Crystal has a deep, fermented umami flavor, with a warm, mellow heat. There is nothing wrong with Tabasco, but it has a much sharper, zingier flavor, with significantly more heat. \\n\\nThe thought of having, say, a fried-shrimp Po Boy with Tabasco instead of Crystal seems like, I don't know, using ketchup instead of BBQ sauce on pulled pork. \\n\\nVIBE:\\n\\nThere is an incongruity here, that makes it feel like an airport restaurant. The music and color-scheme are kind of upscale soul/lounge, but the furniture and wall decorations have a half-baked seafood-shack theme. There is an opportunity to go full swamp-country juke-joint here, with zydeco music and neon and New Orleans Jazz and a Big Easy vibe, or to take it in the urbane nightlife direction that it half wants to go. Either could work. But splitting the difference is... not awesome. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\n\\nI sat at the bar. Both of the bartenders were really nice, but training is still clearly incomplete, and inexperience shows. The difference between sides and starters was a source of confusion, as was a question about the raw bar pricing versus the \\"southern boil\\", what came with what, how the \\"by the pound\\" pricing worked, etc. When I asked about the Etouffee, the bartender said she had never tried it, \\"but a lot of people order it\\". \\n\\nAppetizers, salad, and entree came literally all at once, carried by the same food runner on the same try. They also came without napkins or silverware, which I had to flag down a bartender to ask for. \\n\\nI noticed a customer near me repeatedly try to flag down a bartender, including calling him by name as walked directly in front of the customer. Eventually he got help from a hostess or waitress, who could not answer his question about crab pricing. \\n\\nMENU/FOOD:\\n\\nFull bar. Wine list is extremely thin.  \\n\\nI was really disappointed not to see certain creole staples on the menu. No Louisiana BBQ shrimp, no Debris Po Boy, no alligator anything, no turtle soup, no dirty rice, no Oysters Bienville or En Brochette, no Cochon de Lait, no shrimp remoulade, no crawfish etoufee (although they did have a shrimp version, which nobody had apparently tried on the night I was there).  I should have checked the dessert menu to see whether they had beignets or pecan pralines, but my guess is that I would have been disappointed. \\n\\nShort version is that this is more of a cajun/creole \\"themed\\" menu, than anything like you would actually find in cajun country.\\n\\nThe gumbo was pretty good. Not awesome, but legit. The cornbread was dense and mediocre. I could talk more, but I want to get to the Jambalaya:\\n\\nFor those who don't know anything about Jambalaya, I am going to simplify this: you can get vastly better Jambalaya at Not Your Average Joe's, slightly cheaper, just up the road in Randolph. If you do a google image search for Jambalaya, it does not look like what you will get at Atlantic Kitchen. \\n\\nFor those who do know Jambalaya, this is emphatically in the \\"red\\" camp. There is no shrimp or seafood. If there is a mirepoix or roux, I can't taste it. It's a bowl of thick red sauce with some chunks of sausage and shredded chicken, and a scoop of white rice. It's basically beanless chili, with low/moderate heat, but an overpowering flavor of cayenne pepper.\\n\\nOVERALL:\\n\\nI would love to see a legit (even flawed) cajun/creole place take hold here. But right now, their menu/concept is confused and vague. The flagship, priced-by-the-pound, \\"southern boil\\" menu, with your choice of confusing spice/flavor options, appears to throw even the staff for a loop about what to expect. Service is uneven and poorly trained. Good Jambalaya is not hard to make, check the America's Test Kitchen recipe. Put some Crystal on the tables, get the decor concept together, and tell your Sysco rep you need some Alligator nuggets. Stand out, with some real creole/cajun dishes. Put BBQ shrimp and Oysters Bienville on, they are delicious and easy to make. Put Vieux Carre and Hurricanes on the drink menu. \\n\\nI hope these guys figure it out. I fear that the confusing mediocrity of their cajun/creole offerings will steer the owners towards a more burgers-and-chicken-fingers menu, instead of directing them to a true destination spot, with a legit bayou menu. Right now, everything needs work."},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I have never been treated this poorly in a restaurant.

My sister had a friend in town who wanted an Italian dinner and because it was nearby we took her to Antonio's. On Friday I went online and tried to find their dinner menu. I could only find the summer menu and called to ask where I could find the main one. The girl who answered the phone offered to look online but I could tell she wasn't much interested in helping so I said I would find it. She seemed relieved and said \\"ok.\\" I ended up getting it from another website. Today I was able to find it easily and it looks like the website format changed so not sure what the issue was. \\n\\nMy sister and her friend ordered off the summer menu which was not appealing to me. It was a good offer in that for $26 you could get an appetizer, entree and dessert. My sister ordered the soup of the day (white beans and ham), pappardelle and short ribs and poached pears (as suggested by the waiter when asked). The soup was absolutely delicious. My sister enjoyed the entree (good portions) and the dessert was a small portion and was not very impressive looking or to taste. \\n\\nOur friend ordered the stuffed mushrooms, pollo milanese, and strawberry cheesecake parfait. She enjoyed them all. The entree was a huge portion. We definitely didn't leave hunger.\\n\\nI asked the waiter what appetizer could we not miss and in this suggestion he got it right - the stuffed artichokes. When he delivered them I thought they were chicken thighs. That's exactly what it looked like because they were long stemmed artichokes stuffed with goat cheese but then made to look fried as it came with crispy prosciutto. Very unique and delicious. I also ordered the beef tenderloin carpaccio. The arugula it came with was delicious but the carpaccio was SO thin it was hard to take off the plate and by the time you tried to eat it there was nothing left. No substance.\\n\\nI ordered the pappardelle with salmon floating with peas, brandy and mascarpone. This was really nice and a generous portion. The desserts were not inspiring to me so I skipped. I was quite full anyways.\\n\\nThe wine we ordered was nice.\\n\\nIf we left the review here I would have given Antonio's a 4. But to me a big part of the experience is service. This is where the rating dropped easily by a point. We were immediately greeted when we walked in with good humor and taken right to our seat. Then our waiter came. In fact at first I wasn't sure who the waiter was as he never really welcomed us or gave us his name (until I asked - Juan). I didn't realize until I left and thought about my sister's comment that this place was \\"old school\\" when I said something about this service. All the servers were older men which don't matter to me as long as I have good service. However, I think this is where the issue comes in. I had a sense that these servers had been there a long time and that they are \\"resting\\" on the reputation of Antonio's and were not properly trained to provide good service. Even though Juan responded to all my requests I almost felt like I was bothering him. He also kept coming up behind my sister in the booth and asking questions. It was awkward for her to have someone behind her providing service. I finally think at one point I motioned for him to come over to the side of the table so we could carry out a proper conversation. I would have maybe expected that at TGIF from a 23 year old server - not at Antonio's. And you could tell from the looks of the other servers that they didn't look particularly happy or customer focused. They certainly did not care about adding to the dining experience. \\n\\nThe only highlight aside from when we were greeted in terms of service was at the very end when Alan was clearing off our table. Now most of the time during service he would reach and not say excuse me or say anything but at the end he joined into the conversation when he heard something that intrigued him. He was a very nice way to end the evening.\\n\\nOverall, I would say I would love to go back but service is so important to me that I would rather take my experience somewhere else and try something new. It is a shame because this place has the potential to easily be 5 stars. Oh and one last thing that reflected the unprofessionalism of this place. One guy was at our table at the beginning doing what I don't know and my sister had mentioned we had thought about going to Enzo's instead last night and his attitude was so despicable and unprofessional it was disappointing. He could have made one nice comment about the \\"competition\\" and then made a fun joke that our experience would be better at Antonio's. I will say that I will never ever forget one of my dinners's at Enzo's when that lovely man was still with us - he came over to our table for no reason and was so charming and delightful it made for a night I will never forget.

We showed up and were sat very close to our reservation time. The vibe of the place is really nice--lots of reclaimed wood, nice low lighting, it feels welcoming and pretty cool at the same time. My only problem was that at the table for 10, I was at one end, and had a really hard time hearing the conversation! Lame, but true.\\n\\nOur waiter was very attentive and helpful. He made suggestions, helped up figure out how to navigate the menu as it's Asian tapas, and how much was too much (we still ended up getting too much though... ha!) We literally tried everything. I'm a bit of a bore and don't eat pork or red meat, so I won't report on any of those dishes.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nWe started with cocktails, I had the tequila sunrise and liked it--it had really interesting flavors, but it was teensy. Soon switched over to beer.\\n\\nThe dishes came and went, we ordered more of what we liked, and it was really fluid and nice, but omg I was stuffed by the end!\\n\\nWe got:\\n-Sweet Potato chips with onion dip were really good--the chips were super thin and light, and the dip was great. I had to limit myself on those :)\\n-The whipped hummus had great spice, not Asian that I could tell!, but had great flavor. And the pitas were super crisp and well seasoned. I loved it.\\n-Bison Slides, the girls LOVED these, I loved the french fries ;)\\n-Pickled Veggies, ok but too vinegary, I wouldn't get these again\\n-Veggie Dumplings, a little on the spicy side which I liked, but the veggie interior kind of blended together for me--we also had the beef and pork, but I didn't try those.\\n-Shrimp Shumai--really liked these, my fav of the dim sum options. They weren't too salty and had great shrimp flavor and were light\\n-Edamame--yummy sauce on them, but I thought they were a little mushy / overcooked. I'm sure it was just out batch!\\n-Panko Fish and Chips. This was my favorite thing of the meal. The fish was super light, the panko crust was awesome--super crunchy, held on there really well, it was a highlight for me. The soft fish vs. crunch texture was really nice.\\n-Kale Salad was delish, and it felt like something healthy when we were diving into tons of dumplings, noodles, friend things, etc. Some thought the dressing was too salty, but I didn't mind it. If you're super sensitive to salt, I might shy away or ask for dressing on the side.\\n-The only 'noodle' dish i tried was the 8 treasure veggie rice, which was good. It's not the best fried rice type of dish I've had, but I appreciated the veggies and the consensus from my friends was that they loved it. (I had just had awesome chicken fried rice 2 nights prior, so I was a little more judgmental that usual on that front.) The girls also got the Dan Dan noodles and Spicy Pork, and a beef dish, but I tried none of those.\\n-We also had the buttermilk friend chicken, which everyone loved. Again, the crust was great. I had a tricky time eating my piece of this--the sauces were great, but I always struggle with eating elegantly when I'm eating something with the bone-in. The ladies really loved it, next time I'd go for the salt and pepper shrimp instead b/c that really piqued my interest and we didn't try it.\\n-The waiter brought over some shisho peppers (off-menu), which I always love. We didn't have any spicy ones in our batch, but it made for fun conversation and lots of scared faces. Ha!\\n-And I was so intensely full that it was a problem. I thought we were getting the check, but instead, we had the dessert. AND thank god we did. It was unreal. The cookie was hot out of the over and gooey and amazing and the ice cream was the perfect accompaniment. Totally not Asian (maybe the ice cream had a spice?), but seriously unreal. \\n\\nAnd. Our check. I was so pleasantly surprised. It ended up only being $40-$60 per person (one friend wasn't drinking, so we discounted for her).\\n\\nIf I were to go again, I'd get:\\n-Shrimp Shumai\\n-Sweet potato chips or hummus\\n-Kale salad\\n-Panko Fish and Chips\\n-Salt and Pepper Shrimp\\n-Cookie\\n\\n(Long enough?

Kona grill is a great place to go after all that tiring shopping at the domain!

It is the best combo of chewy and crispy, and delicious with the spicy sauce that they make! The half price sushi is also pretty good (although the choices are limited) and I would recommend the Atlantic roll (cooked salmon) and the crunchy crab roll! The margarita and bbq chicken flatbread pizzas are great choices too! The sliders are also a good deal for happy hour as it comes with 2 sliders and fries (you can ask for extra sauces like honey mustard!). If you are feeling something light, the lettuce wraps are a good choice as well. \\n\\nFor their happy hour drinks I've only tried the sangria and margaritas! The red wine sangria is delicious and comes with fresh fruit inside! The margarita is also good, but kinda on the strong side for me! the service is good most of the time, however if you sit at the side bar, the service tends to be slower as all the waiters are gathered by the table seating. You should come a little earlier (5pm) if you want to be seated inside, but there are also outside happy hour seats (too cold for me in the winter, but really nice if the weather is nice outside)!

I've been to most of the restaurants there, so this \\"Willy Wonka's Factory On Crack\\" steampunk place was new to me and seemed like a good choice for a place to hang out and experience a \\"theme park\\" dinner together.\\n\\nNormally, I would knock a star off for this, but considering this is at Universal, and it was also Valentine's Day, I'll let it slide. We had a nearly 2 hour wait for a table. Granted, we had a party of 8, so there would be a wait anywhere we went, but 2 hours is a really long time just to get seated. But, as I said, this is Universal, it was a holiday, and the place is fairly new, so I'll let that slide.\\n\\nOn the bright side, our long wait gave us ample time to check out the other parts of the restaurant. They really run with the steampunk theme and sell a lot of cool looking steampunk figurines and stuff. It's all pretty pricey, but it's City Walk, so, yeah. They've also have a pretty sweet collection of candy and chocolate (I swear on Spider-Man that pun was not intended). Lots of chocolate, lots of cotton candy, as well as milk shakes and cookies. \\n\\nWe finally got our table, and we were seated outside. The weather was beautiful that night, so it was a nice spot to hang out as well as people watch the tourists. Our server was friendly and happily explained the theme, menu, and overall story of the place. I had a big lunch earlier in the day, so I figured that a chicken BLT wouldn't be too much. Boy, was I wrong. The chicken patty in the chicken sandwich turned out to be near the size of an entire chicken! I wasn't complaining though. The sandwich was very tasty, and the kettle chips that came with it were really good, too.\\n\\nI like this place a lot.

I love selecting different dim sum specialities from the rolling carts (they have all the standard offerings like har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, etc.) and I never get tired of watching the ladies fry up my turnip cake right in front of me. I highly recommend the sweet tofu \\"pudding\\" (doufu fa), which is served hot with sweet honey syrup. They also have steam tables on each floor, offering dishes like mussels in black bean sauce.

First off this review is only for the confectionary side with all the baked goods. This place was packed to the max I felt like a sardine. The desserts all look too beautiful to eat. People were buying desserts like crazy!! We got the chocolate lava artisan cake, the cookies and cream truffle shot and a key lime pie truffle pop, all delicious as can be. I really wanted to try the macaroons but that section was way too crowded to even navigate and I was already spending so much money on the items I already had. They also have cotton candy of all types of flavors and many different kinds of chocolates and candies that you can put into mason jars. This is definitely a place to visit if you're in Universals citywalk. I will always be a fan of dessert places as that's my favorite part of a meal, so this was heaven for me.

I know, I know, I should be thrown out of the state (\\"Get a rope!\\"), but it's true. You see, I like my sauce sweet, some would say sickly sweet. Give me a plate of ribs from the Rib Pit in Hickory Hills, Illinois, drowning in sauce with a pile of fries and some Texas Toast (ironic, I know) and I'm happier than a pig in slop. Because I like to eat pigs, and Texas BBQ is mostly cow-centric.\\n\\nBut you know what I am a fan of? FANCY things. So when I heard Lambert's was putting out FANCY BBQ it moved onto my list of Places To Try When Someone Else is Paying. We went on a Saturday for lunch. The crowd was an odd mixture of people with children and skinny blond girls, all of whom seemed to be ordering the one meat plate with salad. C'mon ladies, live a little. Although perhaps that's why they are skinny and I am not. I liked the feel of the interior, which is an historic building, although it's another one of those restaurants where you get to know your neighbor really well due to the proximity of the tables.\\n\\nI had the two meat plate (brisket and pork ribs) with mac and cheese and waffle fries. Because when you're surrounded by skinny girls why NOT enjoy a festival of meat and carbohydrates. The brown sugar & coffee rubbed brisket is the best I've had thus far. The ribs, or I should say \\"rib\\" was fantastic. I gnawed that puppy to the bone. According to the menu, the ribs are \\"maple and coriander crusted.\\" It had a wonderful citrus-y flavor. It was different than the ribs I usually prefer, but just as good. The mac and cheese was a little on the salty side, but I was so happy that they do not partake in the dreadful trend of putting soggy breadcrumbs on top. The waffle fries, nicely presented in a little cup, were crispy and delicious. \\n\\nInitially, the portions look small, especially when compared to your typical BBQ joint. But it ends up being just the right amount of food. Some may be disappointed with the portion-to-dollar ratio, but to me the interesting flavors and high quality are worth it. My only issue was with the service. Our waitress was basically a non-presence. I think we saw her when she took our order and when she brought the bill. At one point I looked around and all the tables around us were eating this delicious-looking cornbread. I wanted to order some but couldn't get her attention before the entrees were brought out. From reading other reviews it looks like the cornbread is complimentary, she just opted not to bring us any. I don't want to be that person who whines about free cornbread but I guess that's who I've become. Thanks, yelp. \\n\\nSo the answer to my question (\\"Is FANCY BBQ even a thing?\\") is a resounding YES. Round up the pigs and get out the coriander - I'll be back for those ribs."},{"name":"Grand Floridian Cafe","address":"4401 Floridian Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is quite the gem for the sake of being on Disney property where it is easy to let quality drop when you are constantly serving the masses. \\n\\nThis particular review is for breakfast. The service is excellent and my server was very friendly and engaging even though she had a large party across the way.\\n\\nThe food is probably contingent upon what you order. If you order a Mickey waffle I mean, it's a Mickey waffle, but in this case the eggs Benedict were tremendous and it was served with a very light and tasty tomato salad. The hollandaise sauce is wonderful and the new potato casserole(additional side) is equally excellent. \\n\\nIt is a bit different than the one over at Olivia's cafe as that one is a crab cake eggs Benedict.\\n\\nRecommended all around and fairly easy to obtain a reservation even during the busiest of seasons."},{"name":"Sunee Thai & Lao Kitchen","address":"1400 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Extremely underwhelming.

After a week with a group of friends, I came here as a party of one and sat down ready for some true BBQ. It may have looked weird, but it felt so right. I had the fried green tomatoes, easily one of my top dishes of the entire week. This honestly could have been my main dish, the crab is balanced so well with the light vinaigrette salad and arugula and there's really a ton of it here. The tomatoes were perfection. I ordered the sampler, with mac and cheese and cole slaw. Honestly, both were so good. I don't really like cole slaw and I'm a huge mac and cheese critic, Lambert's knows what they're doing. I laughed when the waitress said that the cole slaw would \\"balance\\" the meal, but it actually was refreshing. I ended up with ribs and coffee rubbed brisket instead of pulled pork. I ended up being able to try all three. Do not skip the coffee brisket. The pulled pork was surprisingly my least favorite, though still super well cooked and pink in color. There's clear talent in this kitchen and if you're looking to make sure you taste classic BBQ while you're in town, this place is really something else. Ambiance was just fine. I'm only reserving the extra star as I did feel that this place could have been found in another location and that it wasn't as unique to Austin as some of the others that we visited.

It was strange because Downtown Disney was the only place that made me feel like Disney really needed to do some work. Don't get me wrong, there are some very nice parts of Downtown Disney, but there are some places where I felt it really faltered.\\n\\nFirst, the positives. Stores like the World of Disney or the Xmas store have a great selection. It took forever just to see everything, let alone choose what to buy. Just the idea of having a Disney/Xmas store open year round is genius. I was also partial to the Earl of Sandwich (you can go read my review, delicious) and all of the awesome things to see near the Lego store. The Disney art store was also pretty amazing. My fiancee bought some of the lightboxes they had. The Pirates of the Caribbean one she bought for her parents was especially cool.\\n\\nNow the negatives. First, while there is a whole lot to see in terms of things to buy, they still get you since there are things you can only get in the park. I really think it would be a smart move on their part to have more of the stuff they sell in the parks available at Downtown Disney. I know I am not the only person to plan Downtown Disney on the last day before we leave. I think they could sell a lot of the stuff that people say \\"oh we'll pick that up before we head home\\" if they had it at Downtown Disney. Also, aside from the Marketplace area, there wasn't a whole lot to do. Most of Pleasure Island is closed during the day, and honestly, after spending a whole day in one of the parks, do you really have the energy to go clubbing? Plus, when it comes down to it, the cover to get in to those places just is not worth it. The West Side is OK but I was surprised and disappointed by the quality of the non-Disney stores there. For instance, the movie collectibles place there seemed like it was going out of business. There were empty shelves and the items they did have were exorbitant."},{"name":"Botekim Brazilian Bistro","address":"1410 Terrell Mill Rd SE","city":"Marietta","stars":"4","text":"Let me start by saying I'm not an experienced Brazilian food consumer.  This was my first time.  Never been to a Brazilian steakhouse either.  My boyfriend and I went here and used a Scoutmob. \\n\\nWe started with a bottle of wine.  We love red wine, but we're not wine connoisseurs, and we usually order something from wine country.  Last night, we were feeling froggy, so we asked our server about some international choices on the menu.  She honestly had no clue.  Like I said, I'm no expert, but I knew more than she.  We ended up just choosing an Italian red wine off the menu, which was a good choice.  After pouring our glasses, the server re-corked our bottle... yeahhhh.  The manager was roaming the tables and came by to ask how everything was.  While visiting, he asked if we wanted to let our wine breathe, so he removed our cork.  Thanks, bud.\\n\\nFor our entrees, keep in mind I don't know the correct nomenclature, Lover ordered pork loin with collard greens and some kind of bananas.  After reading reviews on Yelp, I ordered the braised beef ribs with yucca and asparagus.  FREAKING YUMS.  Lover's pork was a tad bit dry in the first few bites, but loved it after.  The collard greens were amazing and the bananas were breaded in something and were incredible!  One steak knife was brought out before our meal, which was confusing since we both ordered meat, but was immediately cleared up when I put my fork in my beef.  SOOOO tender!  It was served with a tasty sauce, which boyfriend liked dipping his pork bites in.  This was my first experience with yucca and I definitely will be eating these delightful potato-things again.  The food was great!  Our server was attentive and stopped by every so often.  We refilled our wine glasses, but it wasn't a big deal.  The manager checked on us again.  The chef even came out to make sure everything was delicious.  Boyfriend told him how much he loved the sauce on my beef, and apparently the sauce was cooked for more than 30 hours!\\n\\nThe bill came to be around $60 after tip and Scoutmob discount.

Sometimes, it's more serious, such as substituting a beef burger for a VeggieFi burger. Inevitably, it happens when I order to go, which makes it doubly annoying. BurgerFi seems to place a real premium on customer service (Every time I've complained, they've bent over backwards to make me happy.) So it's odd that this issue persists.

We arrived about 7 minutes after 3 PM and just now, at 4:26 PM ordering our Canoli and Espresso. Our server, Jessie, is a most gracious host with experience and expertise to spare (I'd love to steal him for my own place ). He patiently explained the constituents, method of preparation, and plating of each brunch and main menu item we enquired about. To cut to the chase, do try the octopus (we were floored!); Get the garlic knots, they are substantial and sumptuously garlicky (we had to take one home); If you like Cauliflower, get it, it's sublime - just the right bit cooked with raisins and a gentle sauce; The Shakshuka was tasty, if a bit on the the non-busy, almost spare, side; compared to traditional recipe, it was eggs, sauce.(lots of sauce), and cheese with basil and a nice hunk of garnished, cheesy bread; finally, the mini canoli (we had the nutella filled variety) were delectable (yummy!). I can't comment on the meatballs, because we have them to go ... Bruno's is a gem in our greater Orlando area and I'd urge you to give it a try. You will have a unique and memorable gastronomic experience and it will become one of your favorite places to hangout with friends and family.

On our second visit to Mad Hatter Caf√©, the food, service, and friendliness of the staff were top notch. Not only did Dermot remember me from my first visit, he also remembered what I had ordered!\\nThis time,I splurged on the traditional \\"Irish Fry\\" which was probably the best I've ever had, including numerous breakfasts in Ireland.  The eggs were GENTLY fried which keeps them tender, the Irish sausages were excellently flavorful and wonderfully seasoned, and the homemade brown bread isjlin the best. The black and white puddings were nicely presented, sliced on a long diagonal AND they were tasty. Dermot must know a very good supplier!  Add in the Irish bacon, Batchelor beans, generously tall glass of OJ, and the full pot of Barry's and you've got a winner of a breakfast to fuel you for the day! 'Tis a great value for less than $10.  My 96-year-old mother was delighted to receive 10% off the price of her meal for what the waitress called a \\"lady's discount\\" -- a most gracious way of saying \\"senior citizen discount\\".

I can wake up in the morning and eat a candy bar - that's what kind of sweet-lover I am. I'm temporarily living in the North End and am so excited because I am near all the pastry goodness. I've tried a bunch of goodies from Mike's so here's what I have to say:\\n\\n- Oreo cheesecake / Red velvet cheesecake ($4.25): I've had a few of these and have come to the conclusion that I am NOT A FAN of their cheesecakes. I don't know what it is exactly, but the cheesecake is NOT SPECIAL, if anything, kind of bland and generic. I've had better frozen cheesecakes with more flavor. But if you are going to get a cheesecake, I would recommend the Oreo cheesecake because there's more flavor with the Oreo mixed in.\\n\\n- Red Velvet cake ($3.25?): After trying the red velvet cheesecake I decided to go for red velvet straight up. It was just OK. I was expecting more flavor in the cream cheese frosting but it didn't live up to my expectations.\\n\\n- Chocolate & Red velvet whoopie pies ($3?): This was okay for what it is. Not spectacular but I'd give it a try. Something you can buy your young kid.\\n\\n- Lobster tail ($5): I bought this not knowing what a lobster tail was. Boy was I pleasantly surprised to bite into the crispy brown Sfogliatelle and taste that creamy goodness. This is also a pretty dang LARGE treat so it took me a few days to eat it. I've tried the lobster tail at Bova's ($4 for their large which is a little smaller) and for the price/size I'd go with Mike's.\\n\\n- Cannolis (vanilla, chocolate chip, chocolate, regular) ($3.25?): I'm from CA and had never had a cannoli before. When I discovered what this delicious treat was, I went a little overboard. These cannoli's pre-made are a PRETTY DECENT SIZE. They will ask you if you want powdered sugar on it. One weekend I went out and bought 4..ate them all at once because I have no self control like that and have never eaten a cannoli since. (This was about 3 yrs ago). Since Mike's has been remodeled, they have a lot more cannoli options - which makes me want to try it again.\\n\\n* Check out the pictures I posted! *\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're a tourist/stopping by the area, I would RECOMMEND this place. You have to try it once and see for yourself. Like the lobster tail, don't recommend the cheesecakes so much.\\n\\n** SECRET tip: Depending on when you go here, it's packed with people (weekends, nights, some afternoons). With much experience frequenting the shop, I've learned to go in the doors and head to the left end of the counter. I find that people usually stand in the middle foyer of the store figuring out what they want/standing in a line that isn't moving and I am usually ordering my goods and out the door without dealing with that mess."},{"name":"Timbertrain Coffee Roasters","address":"311 W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Yum!

Anyway, I wound up ordering a chocolate cake with mocha frosting ($2 extra for mocha) with a little happy birthday message on the top and some balloon decorations. The cake looked like a hack job, like something you'd get at a supermarket, maybe worse. Red, white, and blue decoration on a mocha frosting--ugly.

It's a five these days and the reason is simple- pettiness. I ordered to go the last two times I have been by this restaurant. Both times I was disappointed with the cooking time and final results. I ordered curry chicken, brown rice, black beans, a side of plantains, and Callaloo. If I had not insisted I wanted another green besides collards I would never have known it was an option (not listed clearly in the sides menu). The callaloo was good as was all else but they forgot my beans and I had to come back and rescuers they add them which led to a longer wait. Separate day - I thought I'd give them another chance. I ordered fried whiting, brown rice, black beans, and side of plantains. By the way - plantains are highly OVERPRICED for 3 small half slices ! $3! A dollar per sliver. Really my people! Really! Then the dish came out Burnt and the plantain also burnt. With total hesitation the cashiers cringed awaiting my reaction. I asked the fish and plantains be done over- long wait. $12 by the way was the order's cost. After waiting the fish looked not much better and the plantain were also not far from a NO. Too hungry I left disappointed. My fish was old and if it's not a regular request -TAKE IT OFF THE MENU BUT DONT OVER CHARGE CISTOMERS FOR DROZEN OLD FISH AT THE BACK OF UOIR FREEZER!!! On top of all this my STYROFOAM to go container was sent thru the microwave to reheat and of course the rice heat scorched the inside this I ate radioactive waste!

The fish served is fresh, made-to-order and hot with crisp breading when it arrives at your table. Plus, the fish doesn't stink. The tartar sauce is of the non-chunky variety, has the perfect amount of dill in it (I want the recipe) and is a great dipping sauce for everything (seriously). The English breakfast tea is spot-on and the shepherd's pie has the perfect savory combination of spiced ground beef, seasoned mashed potatoes and cheese. The owner, an ex-pat from the UK, is great and the staff are all friendly *bonus points*. Aside from the food, which is reason enough to check this place out, this is the hang-out for Doctor Who fans. The door to the washroom is TARDIS-blue and looks like a police call box.

The bills came out and mine was $2.17. Okay cool so I didn't have enough $1 bills for a tip plus beer so I gave him a $5 assuming I would get change. Our waiter collected all the checks and came back with both of my friend's changed or credit card receipt. He proceeded to ask me if I had wanted changed. Ummm yeah, why would I tip you more than the beer itself? Plus where the hell was my water I asked for? I also never told you or indicated in anyway that I had not wanted my changed and it was all good. Unfortunately this is the second time I have been here with something not going well.

So, I decided to order a bunch of stuff and take-out. Let's start with every item, one-at-a time.\\n1. Lobster tail- their best item, don't miss out on this, no matter what. Their dough is really good, soft and crispy at the same time. But their cream is really delicious, it is very freshly prepared and does not have any artificial sugars added to it.\\n2. Cannoli- no doubt, they are rated as best cannoli in US. I took their pistachio, pecan caramel and Florentine cannoli. The first two are really good, but the Florentine is slightly on the sweeter side.\\n3. Tiramisu and chocolate mousse cake - the cakes do not match their above stated counterparts. Although they were good but not as good.\\n4. Creme br√ªl√©e- omg!!! I love creme br√ªl√©e, no matter wherever I eat it. But theirs was really special. Cream was fresh and without added sugar.

It was busy as expected so we knew that it would maybe be a delay in being seated and even receiving food. We decided to order drinks and appetizers to crave our hunger. We had a waiter that began as a polite informative individual but ended up a rude inconsiderate jerk. He explained the menu and even sat down (weird) and pointed out all his favorite things on the menu. This was helpful because I made my decision based on his recommendation. But that was the end of his hospitality and usefulness. He barely came back to check in as we waited \\"OVER AN HOUR\\" for our food. As he went  from table to table, I had too stop him and ask \\"When will our food be ready, it's been over 45 minutes?\\" I thought this was a valid and logical question. He replied \\" I don't place your order as soon as you sit down....\\"  then said \\" let me get my manager\\" and abruptly walked a way. I did not request a manager, I was acquiring about my food. The manager came to out table and asked \\"how may I help you\\" I told him that I did not request a manager and please cancel my order and tally up my drinks and appetizers. I will not return to this establishment because of this experience.

The restaurant had a decent amount of people, but nothing I haven't seen before, and it was very easy to find a seat. There were 2 parties going on, and it became apparent that the staff and kitchen were prioritizing the parties over the rest of the customers. Usually, when I come in to a round table I wait 15-20 minutes tops for my pizza. Not this time. I waited 20 minutes, saw tons of pizzas go out to the party. I waited 30, and still more pizzas were being taken to the same exact group (a birthday party from the looks of it). I started to worry when another customer who had been there before us told someone on the phone, \\"We've been here an hour, and no pizza yet.\\" \\n\\nFinally, after 45 minutes we just walked back up to the counter and asked them to put our pizza in a box. It was another 10 minutes after that that we finally got the pizza, thankfully still warm. \\n\\nI heard a few other people complain and ask for the same thing. I used to work at Round Table (not this one, but 3 other ones) and I've seen a busier dining room than this and it still never took us more than 15-20 minutes to get customers their pizzas. The bottom line was we served people in the order they placed their orders - we didn't prioritize parties over regular customers. We also didn't let pizzas sit on the counter waiting to be run for over 10 minutes at a time like I saw happen.

I finally visited Ray's on the River for dinner (and not just the Sunday Brunch).  Actually, the evening started with a visit for Ray's $10 wine & cheese event (third Friday of every month--be sure to check their calendar).  That event, in and of itself, was very cool.  On the \\"lawn\\" by the river, two wines paired with a selection of cheeses.  Very pleasant setting.  And the weather even cooperated.  Even if you're not there for the wine (or the cheese) this is a convenient way to wrangle a small networking event without a whole lot of planning time--something I intend to do at Ray's whenever they do this kind of thing.\\n\\nDinner itself was thoroughly enjoyable.  It absolutely lived up to the Ray's reputation for excellence.  I'd heard so much about the crab cakes, I had to get them.  (Here's the description from the menu: \\"[plentiful] fresh crab, creole mustard beurre blanc, roasted corn relish, goat cheese & chive whipped potatoes, grilled asparagus.\\")  Every mouthful was an exercise in perfection.  I now know why they're so popular.  We also had the Shrimp Pasta Marinara: (\\"Gulf shrimp, Torchietti pasta, marinara, micro basil, Pecorino cheese\\").  Totally delicious, and too much to finish.

Around holidays they always have some festively decorated cupcakes, and in the last few years that have added some specialty flavors that rotate in and out, like carrot and red velvet.  They are inexpensive, full-sized, and addictive. \\n\\nThis is a very good birthday cake bakery.

It's a shining jewel in the Columbus food scene and you really can't ever go wrong eating here. \\n\\nThe Easton location is my favorite of the Northstars for a couple of reasons: \\n\\nFirst, it's close to work... so, SCORE! \\nSecond, parking is usually a breeze, I almost never fuss with the lot next to it, it's always packed... I go right to the parking garage, drive to the top, park next to the elevator, and walk the short distance. This also means I can grab Starbucks on my way back to the car. SCORE!\\nThird, the space is beautiful. I usually end up in the second floor seating, which is okay because then I can people watch and dodging the birds living inside is fun!\\n\\nThere isn't much to say that hasn't been said in hundreds of reviews... so I am just going to add my two-cents and be done.\\n\\nAll of the food is good, so you can't make a wrong choice.

Having grown up eating pastries from the Bronx's Arthur Avenue and finding all others to be poor imitations, I am a \\"tough room\\" when it comes to them.  I had never even heard of Mike's, but after eating at Giacomo's this past Sunday, I passed by and saw the line going out the door and down the street.  I figured that any place that has a line that long has to be good.  So after dinner I joined the crowd outside, and once inside found myself to the shortest line.  \\n\\nI was immediately struck by several huge pictures, each illustrating different cannoli varieties hanging over the counter - More varieties than exist in nature nor than God intended there to be.  I figured this must be a sign that cannolis are their specialty, so I made a quick decision to base my order on that suspicion.  I ordered the pistachio (in honor of my Sicilian heritage) and the chocolate chip (in honor of my long held love of chocolate chip cannolis).  I noticed how big and voluptuous the cannolis were, but I was still not all that impressed because no cannolis in any town I've ever visited from Chicago to New Haven to New Jersey has ever come CLOSE to those from Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.  Well, one bite into my first one from Mike's and my strong allegiance to my hometown was irreparably challenged.  \\n\\nAs hard as it is for me to admit this, I have to say that I prefer Mike's cannolis to those of my hometown.  The filling is lighter and creamier, and oh....the flavor.  The shell isn't quite as crisp and flavorful as those from the Bronx, but overall this cannoli blew my mind.  As I say, this is very hard for someone like me to admit.  This is tantamount to betraying the Yankees for the Red Sox.  I won't even admit that Junior's cheesecake is the best in New York.  No Brooklyn cheesecake could ever win me away from the Bronx's own S&S.  My loyalty to my hometown is that deep.  So when I say that MIke's cannolis are better than those from Egidio's or DeLillo's in the Bronx, it is very significant.  Fortunately, I only live 2 hours from Boston these days so it won't be hard to go back to get them every now and then.  Besides, it'll give me more excuses to visit Beantown."},{"name":"Saithong Thai Fusion","address":"710 SW 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great place to go for Thai food, they play good music, got TVs, great service and its never loud In there, great place if you like to talk to the people you're eating with.

If you're really into spicy foods, try the Hot or Holy, but be warned, it is extremely spicy! The chicken is moist and juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Each meal comes with Ma's mac and cheese, coleslaw, bread and pickles. The mac and cheese is the best I've ever had, easily. Coleslaw is made with a light dressing, not you typical mayo-based sauce, and it is delicious.

The last time we were there I had the Rigatoni Bolognese and my wife had the Steak Salad. Both were delicious, especially the Rigatoni which blew me away. It can be a little hard to get a table sometimes but in the warmer weather they have tables outside which makes for a pleasant al fresco experience.

To be honest, the difference in taste wasn't that large. The seasoning is unlike any other I've had before - leans toward a more Asian flavoring. Each 2 pounds came with some sausage, mushrooms, and one corn. We also ordered 1 pound of blue crab - ended up being three of the crabs. They were very fresh! We also ordered the fisherman's catch - blackened fish with crawfish ettouffee and rice.

When we got there we waited about 20 minutes which I had been warned about. The main issue was the filet. I always order my filet butterflied  medium. Even at the nicest steakhouses this is never a problem however this time the waitress tried telling me that they can only do it well done if I wanted it butterflied.  This made 0 sense to me. I actually canceled my order and my family ordered all of their food. My 13 year old son kept his order of butterflied medium which they said they would \\"try\\" to do and it wound up being prefect. So was everthing else. My biggest issue is a steakhouse charging $50 a plate and saying we can't and then we will \\"try\\" to do something all other steakhouses do with no problem. Other than that the food and service is amazing. I would recommend this place but hopefully you will get 5 star service since they charge 5 star prices.

We went last Friday night and dined in. I have to say, I wish we had taken it to go. Our server was rushed and nonexistent. She literally threw our plates on the table and when my husband asked for ketchup for his fries he made the comment of I wonder if she'll throw that us too. Granted it was definitely busy but there's something to be said for good service, which was lacking that evening. The inside is small but nice with a bar and a few booths to sit. There's also a large patio that's covered, which is great. Their calzones are delicious as is their pizza. We also adore their Broadway Bites. On this visit I had the penne alla vodka. She asked if I wanted it regular or spicy. I said spicy but I have to tell you, there was no kick at all. The dish was ok but could have used more flavor for sure. Hubs ordered the southern fried chicken sub. He said it tasted ok but it was on the small side, especially for the price. The great thing is they are open a lot later than any of the other pizza joints around. Overall I would say get pizza, calzones, and the bites for takeout or delivery and you'll be good to go."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Damn good cannoli (ricotta with chocolate chip).

I understand you don't want to underestimate and then have me lurking around you like a hawk demanding my table, but come on.  Give me a break.  Once we were finally seated (in the worst table in the place, by the way--crammed up against a window and wedged in between 2 other bigger tables) we had the endure a spastic server who ignored some tables (including ours) while inappropriately chatting up others.  Hubs ordered coffee (which was a $4.50 french press--fine for fancy coffee, but should have given him the option for the drip, which he would have preferred) and my hot tea was $5.  That's annoying.  The actual food was certainly the highlight--my scramble of eggs, basil, provolone, tomatoes and prosciutto was delicious.

The food was very very good. My husband and I spent ten days in Disney eating at a lot of the signature restaurants as well as regular table service also. The reason for my lower rating is based on the service and the atmosphere. I was expecting a calm wine cellar like atmosphere especially at 9pm and what we got was a loud room full of screaming children. I realize that for the most part, sitting next to children who choose to scream at the top of their lungs throughout your entire dining experience isn't really the fault of the restaurant, but more the parents and I also realize this is a controversial topic. But why you would sit a couple with no children celebrating their five year anniversary next to screaming children (yes, they were this way before we arrived also) to me is kind of questionable. I realize it was a busy night and maybe I should have asked for a different spot, although most of the restaurant was full of screaming kids who were probably exhausted because it was 9pm. Nonetheless, I was trying to be understanding, but it really did ruin our dinner experience and an expensive dinner experience at that. I just feel when you are spending $200+ on dinner, you are paying for the meal and the experience. I have not experienced this type of atmosphere at California Grill or Boathouse and I'm thinking it is the divide between a signature restaurant inside a park versus outside. \\nWith that being said,\\nWe had the classic poutine, cheddar cheese soup, wedge salad, and the porterhouse for two. Everything tasted really good and the steak (rare) was cooked perfectly. \\nAll of the food was very rich. \\nOur service was just okay. Nothing special, nothing too horrible, but certainly not the quality of service we have experienced from other Disney signature restaurants outside of the parks.    \\nI would like to go back and hope for a better experience because I feel the good was really good.

You may not believe that, but it's true.\\n\\nWhen my brother lived in the Short North--which, in case you're keeping score at home, is a neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio; this was also a couple of years before I lived in the Near West Side, which is a neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio; my brother and I moved to Ohio at two different times for two different reasons, and we never lived in the state at the same time; go figure--it was 1996.  Mind you, this was before farmers markets and block parties and temporary pedestrian-only zones were becoming faddish all over the country.  And yet every month, they had this thing called Gallery Hop in which people walked around and basically had fun in the neighborhood.\\n\\nAgain, I know this isn't terribly unique now, but I think it was at the time, especially in Central Ohio.\\n\\nHere's the story for which you've all been waiting:  My brother is basically the only nonprofessional who cuts my hair, so when he lived in Ohio, I didn't get too many haircuts.  Needless to say, one of my mom's only requests for my trip to visit my brother was that I was to come back with my hair cut.  So right before we were going to check out the Gallery Hop, my brother began cutting my hair.  At the time, he normally used a combination of scissors and an electric clipper, and he had recently bought a new cordless clipper.  The problem was that the battery either wasn't fully charged or didn't hold a charge very well.  So halfway through my haircut, the clipper died.  He didn't have the plug-in kind with him, and there was no way to charge the battery in time, so he suggested we check out the Gallery Hop while waiting for the battery to charge.\\n\\nSince it was my brother who was cutting my hair, I trusted that he had done a decent enough job for me to be seen in public.  But as we were walking around on High Street amid more people than I knew lived in Columbus, I noticed that there were hair clippings on my collar.  I brushed them off, only to notice that there were hair clippings on my face and in my ears as well.  I tried to object to my brother, but it was really loud, and he said I looked fine.\\n\\nWhen we got back to his apartment, I didn't even look in the mirror because I didn't want to know how embarrassed I should have been.  He finished the haircut, and we went out again.\\n\\nIt's pretty cool.  I'm not into all the galleries, but there is a nice sense of non-froufrou community, and that's refreshing.  And the good people of Ohio, at least those who attended Gallery Hops in the mid-'90s, aren't so shallow that they would publicly humiliate a person walking around with a partial haircut and hair clippings all over himself.  Thank you, Ohio."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"What made this experience was the food, desert and the dressed up characters they had interacting with people.

Got to sit at one of the cool boat tables at the back. Though we did have to flag down the waiters a couple of times, it didn't matter which waiter it was - they were all equally helpful. The AYCE is a decent deal at $23 per person, and the menu, though not completely descriptive, does list what kind of portion size each item is, so there's no need to guess about that. What's nice is that they actually get your order right each time - the little paper menu where you write down what you want comes out with your food so if you want, you can verify that everything that you want is there - a huge contrast to other AYCE's that I've been to where they try to confuse you by bringing out parts of your order at a time and omitting to bring the other part completely. Overall the food came out pretty quickly after ordering. Wasn't hugely impressed with the maki except for the chop chop cone - delicious, but hard to eat as all cones are. The salmon sashimi was delicious - rich and fatty and fresh. The chicken karaage is a fried chicken wing drumlette - pretty tasty. We ate a lot of the Korean bbq meat - one order of meat is quite a bit so just be aware of that. All the ones that we tried - the beef ribs, beef, chicken, pork, and lamb, were all really good - great marinade. The lamb has some weird bones in it but that was perfect for me because I like to gnaw :) For desert, they have something listed as 'jello', and it's actually a coffee-flavoured jello with a thin layer of condensed milk on top - it's pretty tasty even though it looks strange.

They also joked about dumping food on the patrons.     People got charged for drinks and items that were never brought out or served.    The entire attitude was that they felt that customers were actually an intrusion into whatever they were doing socially at the time.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this place at all.

But, we had a few things to get, and it's handy to eat there.  Ended up at Adobe Gila's because it wasn't quite as busy as everyplace else- still pretty full, but no line.  \\n\\nThe layout is a bit weird.  Seating is uncomfortable and cramped.  Service was good.  Our waitress was very helpful.  Sweetie had mac and cheese with bacon, mushrooms, and black beans.  I had steak and shrimp fajitas, plus rice and beans.  Everything tasted good; I particularly liked the tender, well seasoned fajita meats, and the rice.\\n\\nNow the negatives.  It is not really my kind of place; more bar-restaurant than restaurant with a bar, in both layout and attitude.  Fine if you want that; I just wanted dinner (though I would have had a beer if they had a more extensive list.)  And if you look back at the description of our meals, everything besides the basics meant an upcharge.  Our bill overall wasn't bad.  But: add bacon to the mac? $1.  Shrooms? $1.  Beans? $1.  Rice and beans as my side? $2.25.  Seriously?  At a Mexican place?  Just nickle and diming you, for things that they could easily include (and fold in a charge for.)  Three small, mediocre tortillas came with my fajitas, not nearly enough.  Want more?  Fifty cents.  Not for three more- one more.  The waitress apologetically explained all this, but the charges just felt silly.\\n\\nWant a beer at Easton?  There are better places.  Want Mexican food?  Try Abuelo's, but prepare for a wait.

Quite possibly the most picturesque and camera-ready photo op at Krog. Great job there. \\n\\nWell, the good news is that the good news doesn't just stop at the sign on the outside! We came in for a geriatric-timed dinner of 5pm. Yeah, it was one of those days. Even though these guys open the doors at 5pm, they were already attracting excited diners for their (probable) first visit. We were happily a part of this group. We grabbed a table in the main part of the dining room and our server, Mike, came over promptly to give us the rundown. Customer service was spot-on throughout our entire time in the restaurant. They do a great job of sharing different jobs -- someone filling water glasses, someone running more chips, food, etc. It worked rather well and everyone was super nice. \\n\\nAs you'd expect from any good Tex-Mex restaurant, chips and salsa hit the table shortly after we were seated. Chips are thin and super crispy. Very well-executed. The salsas are packed with flavor and also a good amount of heat. If you've never experienced an Austin, TX take on heat, you may need to prepare yourself. They aren't shy with jalape√±o here. Both of the salsas, especially the creamy, green salsa, were fantastic. Also, there is a small bottle of a vinegary sauce on the tables. Think Tapatio with way more flavor and a lighter body. I ate this on just about every chip with salsa. Being a huge fan of sauces, this was right up my alley. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Chili con Queso -- Bob Armstrong style. American cheese queso, guac and sour cream in the queso, and a flavorful beef mixture on the side. It's true Austin-style queso with a hefty amount of spices (mainly cumin) in the cheese and is a super fun app. Both of us enjoyed it. \\n\\nShort break from food: The bathrooms are so rad. Seriously cool. Each bathroom is a stall with a screen door on the outside of the main door. Really love this. Just another note on how much attention to detail there is in this restaurant. So cool. \\n \\nEntrees: I decided to go with three different tacos -- Steak al Carbon, Chicken al Carbon, and Al Pastor (Pork Belly). The three tacos came with rice and refried beans. Both were pretty standard and in rather large portions. The tacos were all phenomenal in the flavor department. Especially the Al Pastor. That combination of pork belly with grilled pineapple is a wonderful choice for a corn tortilla. Seriously a winner. The only criticism I can offer is that the steak was pretty dry. Still very flavorful, though. The sauteed onions helped with the lack of moistness. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the chili relleno. Talk about a HUGE poblano. The corn and mushrooms within the pepper were a nice touch and the cheese, of course, truly makes the dish. It's a fantastic choice for any vegetarian. \\n\\nThe food was great (and plentiful) and the service was great.

I work near by and always recommend to people.  But the service I received last night completely clouded my previous experiences.  I arrived with 3 other friends to kona around 6:30, now everyone knows its happy hour, so we quickly picked what we wanted as we only had 30 minutes left of happy hour.  The waiter ALAN (from Chicago) greeted us shortly thereafter.  We asked if we could put in our order since it was almost over.  He assured us that our order would be put in before 7pm.  I noticed Alan had 3 other tables besides ours.  We received our sushi with no chopsticks, and we kept having to stop Alan to remind him to get us water refilled.  At 7:23 I ordered a butter cake for the table to share.  By 7:53pm still no dessert, now it is hard for me to understand why it took so long, I stopped Alan and asked about my dessert, to which he replied with a defensive attitude; \\"I put in your order when you asked me to.\\"  quite honestly I would have appreciated him admitting he forgot.  He followed that comment with \\" We are very busy, we always get busy on Wednesday nights.\\" felt more like an excuse to the amount of time it was taking.  By  now our glasses were empty and we had no water, but the dessert finally came out.  We caught Alan and asked for the bills since it had been taking him long.  Our bills came and we each paid separately but I had cash, I asked Alan if he could bring me change (for tip of course), and he replied \\"I always bring people's change back.\\"  I was very confused with his attitude and response, I was simply asking for it to be broken so I can tip the guy.  My friend ordered another butter cake which we had to ask another waiter because Alan was no where to be found, but this time we timed it.  It took 10 minutes.  And our glasses of water were still empty.  This is the 2nd time Alan has helped us out, the last time he also had an attitude but we thought maybe he was having a bad day.  His condescending attitude was to much to handle, and I had to write a review.  I work near by and I am always here, and this is a restaurant that I would love to continue to recommend but with that kind of service I rather go down the street to Black Finn.  To the management team, I am not sure if this is a trend for Alan but someone needs to tell him that customer service should always be in the forefront, and although one may be busy, and can forget things reacting the way he did is simply unacceptable. I sure hope this is able to get turned around, because with as many restaurant options near by, Kona will sure lose loyal customers with staff like that."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is just speaking to their Happy Hour, which takes place from 3-7 pm on weekdays, then 9-11pm for reverse HH Mondays-Saturdays, 1-5pm on Saturdays, and all day on Sundays!! \\n\\nThe only reason why I didn't give them five stars is because of the service.

Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed in the food.  I enjoyed the manti and the BLT wraps the most.  The short ribs and the corn were ok, but not special.  The clam garlic bread had a really odd spice in it (reminded me of cinnamon or bergamot, something that would be in a dessert) and it made it pretty unpalatable for me.  We had one more dish which I honestly forget (fish with some spiced rice, I believe) because I just flat out didn't like it and didn't eat it.  I am the type of person that always orders desserts but I just didn't want any of their options (the couple next to us eating cookie dough just looked ridiculous) so we ended up at Toscanini's instead.  Service was fine, and I thought the price for the food was a little high but nothing crazy for this area.

One lady sitting near us was irate when she tasted her food - she asked why they had to spice it up at all. Huh? It's like going to the Venus theatre to watch a movie and then complaining about the nudity. We always order the lettuce wrap with chicken to start. This last time we had the fresh squid fried with vegetables (very tasty), Manchurian chicken chow mein (simply sublime), and a cashew-vegetable fried rice dish that was a complete bargain - great taste and a big plate for less than 8 bucks.

My hubby had the chicken (as did quite a few other family members), and even the vegan in the group was able to order a fairly nice salad. Overall this was a great experience. \\n\\nI wasn't a huge fan of the BBQ sauces they offered, but I am pretty freaking picky about my BBQ sauce. But, honestly, my ribs didn't really need sauce. They were quite delicious on their own. The mac n' cheese and broccoli were my two personal favorites for sides, but other members of the fam seemed to dig the potato salad and beans. \\n\\nThe building is beautiful, and I was surprised to see a full bar upstairs with a band setting up when I wandered in to find the restroom. They had a great beer & wine selection, and I could totally see chilling upstairs on a Friday night. \\n\\nThis is definitely fancier BBQ - there is no butcher paper spread out on your table and you are given cloth napkins along with a fork and a knife, but it was the perfect place to take the family.\\n\\nI can't believe I almost forgot to mention the dessert! Apparently this was a special, and not something they always have -- but we ordered two ice cream sandwiches to split. The ice cream was mint - fresh mint, not that crappy boxed mint you get at a place like B&R's, but real mint ice cream....the sandwich was salted chocolate. The entire thing was divine. I looked at my hubby and told him it was the best dessert ever. And then harassed the waiter hoping they carried this dessert every weekend and already imagining the bliss of having such a dessert again. Alas, that is when I learned it was a special.

Don't let the building fool you- the food is well worth the visit. Also, open until 11pm most nights :) Lot parking. Menu online: www.tasteofpunjaborlando.com \\n\\nThe long-winded version:\\nMy hubby found this place online looking at various reviews and chose this once after seeing that the dessert menu contained a homemade ice cream. (Yes, we chose the place because of the dessert menu and my craving for Indian food. That it was close to where we were staying was an added bonus.)\\n\\nIt really doesn't look like much from the outside and I probably would have driven past it for something more shiney otherwise. But I would've missed a culinary pleasure based on it's unassuming exterior. So we go inside and the interior is tidy, tasteful, and reminds me of a garden cafe, but with a few cultural pictures on the walls. I was given hope by the amount of take-out business they seemed to be doing. \\n\\nAnd now for the good part...the food! Ah, the food! The service is excellent. First, I was surprised to see more than just mango lassi. They also offered a sweet and a salted lassi. Who knew? Second, there was a lovely selection of naan...so many to choose from, much to our delight. We went with a yummy, fluffy cheese naan and the garlic naan. Third and so on, they offered a wide selection of lamb and vegetarian dishes and a small, but solid selection of chicken dishes. \\n\\nHubby chose the Tandoori paneer (cheese) tikka and got the chicken pakora appetizer to toss in. (The appetizer reminded me of a more flavorful chicken nugget.) He said the paneer dish had \\"so many different flavors\\" and was a his new favorite. It was a \\"dry\\" dish, so he got a side of tikka sauce. Honestly, I thought it didn't need it, but it was flavorful both ways. I got the chicken methi malai, which was a new dish to me. I chose by the description and this one had Indian spices & herbs, and something called fenugreek in a creamy sauce. I took a chance and came out a winner(...winner chicken dinner...?) And my dish- enough to share with another small stomached (aka bird-like) eater- came with an abundant bowl of rice, too. So yummy! (On a side note: we ordered our dishes mild.)\\n\\nThe dessert (and reason for picking this restaurant) was kulfi- a homemade Indian-style ice cream with rose, pistachio, malai (a heavy Devonshire-like cream), and coconut flavors. It was an interesting and delightful treat that was gone too soon. In a time where most dessert portions are big enough to share with two, sometimes three people, there was barely enough for one...if you ask my hubby. In actuality, it was a small, but rich portion that was perfect for one person. \\n\\nOverall, it is definitely worth a visit for those who enjoy Indian cuisine or for those who want a good spot to try something new. Not too spicy and oh-so flavorful!!"},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Well this place is known for the beautiful sunset that it offers only right!?

Another important thing is that the coffee actually tastes good. I'm not sure what they are brewing but it was full bodied and rich, it wasn't the usual watered down diner coffee, it was something you could actually enjoy. \\n\\nMy wife went with the Mad Hatter omelette for her breakfast which has some mushrooms and meat in there.

Since I don't drink, I couldn't say whether the beer here is actually better than stuff that's been sitting around in warehouses, trucks and liquor stores for a few weeks, but I do get an inkling that my plan to get rich by building the world's first beer cellar, and selling vintage bottles of beer for ludicrously high prices might be a non-starter.\\n\\nI'm here for the food, and, since the pizzas were on special for $8 each, my choice was pretty clear. (I don't know if the pizza deal is every Sunday, or if this was a one-off for Easter Sunday.) Generally, I'm a thick-crust pizza guy rather than a thin-crust guy, but if this puppy had been thick-crust, I would have had trouble finishing it, since it covered the whole plate. The topping choices were on the artsy side for me: I would have preferred it if they had tried to impress me with the freshness or quality of their ingredients, rather than trying to prove that they have a better idea than topping combinations which have worked for years. (The \\"Altered Hawaiian\\" pizza came, not with ham and pineapple, but with ham and \\"pineapple salsa\\". It was also supposed to come with a \\"fresh cut jalape√±o\\", but there was no sign of that. Personally, I would have gone in a direction more like, say, black forest ham and fresh -- not canned -- pineapple, but what the hey.) But still and all, it was reasonably good. Not great, but then again, it's not a specialty pizza place.\\n\\nI also tried the potato wedges, since I've been missing potato skins since they were ruled pass√© by whoever decides these things. I was expecting something like wedge cut fries with a more interesting than usual dip, but no. This was an entire potato, cut into six slices, and cooked to a perfect golden brown. I don't know how they managed to just such huge pieces done so well when so many places can't even do wedge cut fries right, but I'm giving them an extra point on that basis alone.\\n\\nThe service? We saw our server four times: to take our orders, come back and ask the regulation \\"how is everything?\\", bring the bill, and take our money. The rest of the work was done by the busboys. They did a good job, but the place simply wasn't busy enough to justify her outsourcing most of the work like that. Possibly, she needed to go backstage and warm up. It's not like the place is kept at tropical temperatures, and the apparently company issued skirt she was wearing couldn't have provided much insulation, if you catch my drift. (It was less than half the length of the shortest skirt worn by any of the women in our party.)\\n\\nThis place promotes itself as a fun place to go and hang out with your friends, but I'd only recommend doing that if you and your friends aren't talking to each other, because even when the place was more than half empty, the muzak was blasting so loud you couldn't possibly hear anybody more than two places away from you.

Now, I must admit  - the chicken was cooked well, it was moist and not underdone, but cooked correctly. This is where I stop for the compliments.  The chicken had absolutely no flavor on it, I've had better at the hospital!!! The mashed potatoes were bland also and cold. \\n\\nConsidering they were suppose to be trying to keep my business, at least I thought  so, I had hoped for better than overcooked  and bland food!  For the prices of these dishes, I would expect better...\\n\\nSo, to update my visit.. I give this location an increase to 3 stars only - and this is partly due to the Area Manager and mostly everything to do with that waitress. I believe her name starts with an M.  Never once did she make me feel uncomfortable (even after spilling my drink), she started with a smile before knowing I was a returning customer who left a bad review and continued that same genuine great customer service after finding out this information. Never once did her positive energy change just because she found out I was a returning customer. There was nothing fake about it - shes the real deal!!   She treated both me and my husband like guests, like our service was valued......\\n\\nIf you do go to this location, which I sincerely doubt I ever will again, make sure you look for that young waitress with long blond hair, slender build and a huge smile on her face -you wont regret it!!! \\n\\nWhen I go to Waterloo again, which I will because I am use to great food and service - it will be at the North location or the one in central Austin, by 38th st, I believe. I have never been disappointed in those locations.  My honest opinion, I don't believe it to be a restaurant issue, I believe its just this one location - it gives the name, Waterloo a bad rep. Maybe its the mangers, maybe its something else - I'm not sure.  But if I was in charge of these places, I would do some serious thinking about how to get these ratings up for this location. South Park Meadows is a great place to visit but there are soo many options when it comes to choices of places to eat.  If you want returning customers, well.... the food needs to be better and the staff needs some serious retraining on customer service, EXCEPT that blond waitress, bless her heart, just the sweetest gal ever..

Don't get me wrong, the wait staff were totally inept but they were earnest. I ordered the oxtail pho and 2 bun dishes, and to start, 2 dumplings dishes. I know thats 5 dishes not 3, but they never bought out my dumplings. The menu- first of all, how can you serve Vietnamese dishes and not name them Vietnamese. It's fine to include descriptions in English but if the dish is bun thit nuong then call it that, I don't know what bun absolute is?!! The prices are exorbitant for Vietnamese dishes $8 banh mi and $12 pho? Ok, you're thinking \\"well, if it tastes good...\\", well, it didn't. The pho was decent but the pork in the bun dish was meh. They got my order wrong, I ordered the pho oxtail with rare beef, but out came a bowl with brisket, tripe, well done meat, meats galore, but not a single pink piece of rare. Was hungry so I ate it anyway, didn't even complain, since I'd have to wait around and have them come back 3 more times to ask me to repeat my order. The wait staff were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, and I can hear screaming from the kitchen berating them. While son and I were eating, poor hubby just sat and drooled. Yeah, they didn't bring his food. He had to flag them down and remind them about his order. The couple next to us left and we wouldn't have noticed, but while hubby and I were waiting around forever for our check (yes, they forgot to take off the dumplings we never had) our son went next door to check out the basketball game, he saw same couple and overheard them complain how they waited an hour and never got their food so they came to sports bar next door pleading to be fed. I feel bad writing this cuz I always want to support Vietnamese business, but I don't think this one will last. Too bad, we really wanted to make this our go to pho place since we live south, but dang it, gonna make the trek up north.

The man and woman in the kitchen area were working hard and they make everything. I mean every item ordered they made quickly and efficiently. BUT they are extremely unsanitary. I watched the man lay my raw beef on my pho bowl, push it out toward the server, then grab vegetables to put in the wok, then continue to keep cross contaminating everything.

Pretty much every time we come someone tries this in spite of others recommendations against it and then gets on board with not getting it again.\\n\\nAchiote and Lime Rubbed Natural Chicken - Again every time I have had this it has been super dry. Will not get again.  It should be harder to mess up chicken, but they do consistently.\\n\\nSides:\\nThe baked mac and cheese is top notch.  Nice firm crust on top with ooey-gooey mac and cheese underneath.

My experience last night, however, was very disappointing.\\n\\nFood: First, they were out of steak. Half of their menu includes steak--steak sandwiches, steak pierogis, cheesesteaks...so that really narrowed down the options. Also, for a sports bar that serves sports bar food, you would expect a burger of some sort, but no burger on the menu. According to the waitress, Hamburger Mary's has a monopoly for serving burgers on Church Street...although Graffiti Junction, Harry Buffalo's, Kres, Rusty Spoon, and the soon to open Wahlburgers--all located on Church St--also serve burgers. So, being that our options were basically chicken or chili, 3 of our party opted for the buffalo chicken sandwich while I ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich. My husband also asked for his fries to be extra crispy.\\n\\nThe buttermilk sandwich came with a soggy coleslaw on top that then made the chicken soggy as well. The combination with red onions and an unidentifiable cheese just made the sandwich off-putting until I scraped the toppings off. The sriracha mayonnaise sauce for the fries was interesting, but more about that later... The fries were most certainly NOT crispy. Hand cut, yes, but not crispy.\\n\\nService: Oh my goodness, thank goodness I got there early. They had not host to be seen, so we waited awkwardly for several minutes before I could get the bartender to pause to let me know  that we were to seat ourselves. Each member of our party had to individually request refills for our drinks (and the restaurant was not particularly busy when we placed orders and were served). The waitress was not at all proactive about serving our table.\\n\\nPrice: The prices were normal for Church Street. $10-11 per sandwich. Here is the kicker... the sriracha mayonnaise that was brought with our fries--that none of us ordered--was an additional charge. It is usually irritating enough for a waitress not to tell you when something costs extra, but to charge you for something you didn't even order? Ridiculous.

Pumping out the best bbq in the city.  I love ribs, Sweetie might literally kill for their grass-fed brisket (which I will eagerly chomp on too.)  The sauces are good, but almost superfluous.  It's the meat that's the draw.  Tender brisket, full of flavor.  Meaty, not-too-tender ribs.  The pulled pork is excellent too, but it's been awhile- ribs and brisket for us.\\n\\nThe sides are good, but almost irrelevant.  It's nice to have a bite to clear your palate.  I usually get baked beans and corn pudding.  But the mac and cheese, greens, and slaw are very good.  It's also nice that they have a couple of desserts (banana pudding and bacon cheesecake, usually) and I sometimes grab a Boylan's.  But it's the meat that keeps us coming back.  I could never be a vegetarian.  I need occasional doses of bacon, bratwurst, and bbq.  And I bet some vegetarians have been converted at Ray Ray's.  The smells, the tastes...

There are few restaurants where you can enjoy a delicious salmon dish for only $13. The quality of the dish is worth way more than what you're paying (fingers crossed that the managers don't see this and raise the price!)\\n\\n- Hard cider: having lived around the Boston area for so long, I am ashamed to say that I am not a fan of beer (*hides*).

Oh my words. Lucky for us it was Beefcake night Wednesday. or at least that's what I think it was called? Anywho, me and the boy-toy decided to order a the special steak, a BBQ Porker Sandwich, and a salad made special by requesting they put some rabbit's meats tossed in Lover's sauce (made extra spicy just for us!! it really gets us in the mood when we sweat a little while we eat.)

Anyway, the food was delivered not a moment too late, just enough time to keep me yearning and excited. I'll tell you what, me and Gregory didn't even use utensils, we dove right in with our hands, no napkins either.

I am pretty sure I could expect decent food not dried hamster food pellets on top if I did request grilled chicken. This chicken breast was so dry it literally crumbled in my mouth on the first bite...WTH??  They said they would replace it if I bought it back tonight..how inconvenient. After working from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm my expectation is for them to freaking get it right. I would have even let that ride until I bit into my spicy garlic wings. I had to look at the box because there was barely any sauce and it taste just like regular fried chicken wings.

She ordered a Double Whopper with cheese, lg fri and a coke. Brought it home, was a single whopper, plain, cheese only, lg fri and a coke. Receipt on bag had the correct order on it but wrong order in the bag. Mistakes happen so I drove back, walked in and the young girl at the counter asked if she could help me. I gave her the receipt and told her that is what we ordered and this is what we got, and handed her the plain, single whopper w/cheese. She didn't even look to see what it was, she looked at the receipt and said to me, \\"you want another double whopper with cheese\\", I said no, I just want the one we ordered and paid for. She said ok, turned to the guy making burgers and ordered it. I stood there while he made it. She was just going to give me the whopper so I told her I needed a new fri and coke to because they had been sitting for about 20 minutes now. While waiting either the Manager or person in charge walked up and asked if there was an issue, I told him there was, he asked if it was being delt with, I said yes and he turned and walked off, he really couldn't care what the issue was or intested in trying to resolve the issue. I was handed my order and drove home only to find there was no cheese on the whopper. The issue is only partly that the original order was wrong, which was possibly a reading problem or the fact that someone had a plain single whopper in their hand and placed it into a bag with a receipt taped to it that showed a double whopper and there is a noticeable size difference, it's mainly the fact that they could really care less that I had to drive back there to get the order corrected, and that no one said sorry or even checked to see what I had actually gotten that was wrong. The manager seemed very uninterested so I'm sure that's why the employees were uninterested. To the person that got the double whopper with cheese when you ordered the plain whopper with cheese, I would like to say sorry for the mistake because the employees at Burger King in Pickerington Ohio on Hill Rd could care less."},{"name":"Boston Marriott Copley Place","address":"110 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"If I had to summarize my experience in a word, I would describe Boston Marriott Copley Place as \\"mediocre.\\" \\n\\nThe check-in experience leaves something to be desired. If you're arriving from the Hynes Convention Center, finding the registration desk is a bit of a challenge. Once there, you'll either be greeted by long lines (if it's after 3pm), or to be told that there are no rooms available (this applies to the Marriott Elite service desk as well). We got in at 11:45am, and after stopping back at the several times, were finally given a room a little past 2:30pm. It's understandable that the rooms need to be cleaned and that this takes time, but with checkout at 11:00am, something should have been available within three hours of our arrival, and we should not have had to ask multiple times.\\n\\nThe restaurant is, sadly, a sports bar reminiscent of any chain sports bar you've ever been to. The beer list is a bit better than usual, but the food is mostly frozen stuff that they deep fry or throw on a grill. Skip it.\\n\\nThe rooms themselves have pretty decent views of the Back Bay area, but are cramped and dated. My bedspread had a significant amount of hair on it (all types), none of it mine. The furniture was worn down and the walls were a drab brownish yellow.

For $70, we got 2 sandwiches, 2 sides, a cocktail and a beer flight. The food portions were small and underwhelming. We left still hungry. For that amount of money, I would have expected bigger portions. The sandwiches were $14 each and the size of something you would get at a fast food joint. I had the chicken sandwich- which was ok- but the bun was greasy as if it was coated in butter. It felt disgusting on my hands to eat. My husband has the hamburger, which was the size of a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger from Wendy's, and was not good at all. You had to order your sides separately- they were $5-$6 each and were the size of what I would expect a kids portion to be. We ordered the chorizo fritters- only received 4 small balls that were dry and bland. We also ordered the brussel sprouts that were good- just an extremely small portion. The drinks were very good though. \\n\\nThe service was awful. Our server only came to our table 4 times and we were there for about 90 min (most of the time waiting for our server) and the place was only half full. We sat right next to the kitchen and could see he was busy chatting with other workers the whole time. He never refilled our water glass or asked it we wanted a second drink (which we did). The manager never came to our table to ask how our meal was- or I would have been sure to have told them about what a horrible experience we were having. \\n\\nIt was also overwhelmingly hot in the place! There was no AC running (many box fans were out in the restaurant and it was 90* outside). I felt terrible while sitting in the restaurant and asked the server why it was so hot and he said \\"It's usually like this\\".  \\n\\nWe weren't ever told about dessert options- even though we asked about them and saw other people were being served dessert. We ended up going to a separate restaurant for dessert after our dinner here. \\n\\nI would not recommend or go back to this place.

I've sat at the bar and at tables in various spots of the restaurant and every time I get annoyed at how long I'm forced to wait to order a drink and how terribly inefficient the servers are. The bartenders have an amazing ability of completely avoiding eye contact. Last night the guy next to me was literally waving his arms at the bartender because she walked away from him while he was mid-order. Nuts.\\n\\nThe food? Eh, not bad. I'm not a fan of the mini burgers because they always come out overcooked. The tater tots and fried pickles are insanely good but how can you screw that up? My favorite is the BLT with avocado. Delicious and reasonably priced. \\n\\nLast night I was absolutely disgusted with how dirty the floors were. I don't typically notice the floors in a bar but both the restaurant and bathroom floors were muddy and black with dirt. Hello? How about a mop? My other complaint is the TV placement at the bar. You can only see the televisions from a few bar seats prohibiting this place from becoming a bar for watching the Sox games. A shame, really.\\n\\nThe only time I've enjoyed Cambridge Common was when I went on a weekend afternoon. The daytime bartenders are nice, friendly and attentive.

By pure luck, I think I might've found the best bowl in Austin--even if it isn't 100% Japanese authentic.  \\n\\nHere's my breakdown of Yanagi's version:\\n\\n1) Broth.  Yanagi is a Korean run Japanese restaurant (which is actually quite common here in Austin), therefore they serve more of a Korean style of ramen (or \\"ramyeon\\" in Hangul) which consists of a red miso base that's available served regular or spicy.  I ordered the spicy and was actually a bit surprised by how hot it was.  The color is a rich crimson and the flavor (both from the chili oil and miso) was quite strong with a bit of an earthy, bitter aftertaste.  Overall, 4 out of 5 stars.  \\n\\n2) Noodles.  This would probably be the low-point of the dish, since Yanagi uses store-bought ramen noodles.  I can understand why they do it:  Ramen isn't very popular.  It's acceptable, but it doesn't offer the texture or taste of a homemade noodle.  3 out of 5 stars.\\n\\n3) Toppings/ingredients.  Nice bits of squash, onion, Kimchi, and carrot present.  One hard boiled egg and some of the best tasting chashuu pork I've tasted in many, many years (although not nearly enough!).  Quite delicious!  5 of 5 stars.  \\n\\nThis was my first time tasting a Korean ramen and, even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, I was pleasantly surprised with the end result.  The soup costs about $9, is a decent portion size, and appears to be available for both lunch and dinner.  If you're the kind of person who considers themselves an adventurous eater, I'd highly recommend trying a bowl from Yanagi.  You might not look at ramen the same way again!"},{"name":"3 Country Bistro","address":"379 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"A little pricey considering the relatively small portion size, after 18% gratuity it came out to $28 per person for a party of 6.

The volcano sushi and the pad thai were the best sushi and noodle dish I've had.  The service was a little slow but not unreasonable as there was only 1 waitress.

It's closer than driving out to Morse. \\n\\nTheir creme brulee is surprisingly good, you probably wouldn't think that but France used to have Vietnam as their colony. So you see a lot of French ingredients in Vietnamese cooking. Their Thai iced tea (quite sweet) and Vietnamese coffee are good as well and strong. I also enjoy their summer rolls! Not a huge fan of mint/basil or what not, I usually just pick them out. I think you can ask them to roll it without it. A pretty standard Vietnamese place on Bethel. I think it's also less intimidating for people who want to try Vietnamese food because there are always sports, of course Buckeyes, playing on their tvs. It's a small place with a fairly open kitchen, and it's always been clean whenever I've gone."},{"name":"Seito Sushi","address":"4898 New Broad St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Next to be reviewed on the Sushi list...Seito Sushi.\\n\\nLike many sushi places in town, Seito has the classic rolls and dishes with their own spin on things here and there. I've only dined here a few times, each time reluctant to branch outside of my usual order...rainbow and spider rolls with a few orders of salmon and white tuna sashimi. However, I will say that what I have tried was delicious and well done. Among their other dishes, the chicken and vegetable tempura platters are good choices. The batter is nice and crunchy with very little grease and the portions are enormous, enough to take home for seconds and thirds, depending on how hungry you are of course.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very relaxed, with little noise other than people talking around you and soft music playing in the background. This is a good place to go for a date, night on the town or with a group of friend. You can choose to sit inside at a booth, table or at one of the tables outside. I would recommend going for a table because the booths are not the most comfortable I've experienced and the table part does leave much room between you and the back of the seat. \\n\\nMy server has always been efficient, friendly and good about keeping everyone happy. Prices are not cheap, which is typical of most sushi restaurants. However, their lunch specials are great and as long as you keep track of what you order the bill shouldn't be too bad. If you go with a group, I recommend that everyone order one or two rolls and share with the whole table that way you can all try something different. Variety adds spice to life.\\n\\nOverall, I don't frequent this place often because it's not close to my house, but it's not a bad place to venture off to every now and again."},{"name":"Astor Court","address":"88 W Paces Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Basic upscale hotel food.

I never noticed the peppers, and the serving \\"to go\\" came in a plastic tub like soup is served to go. Is soup the same as curry? I don't know. I liked it but the pieces of duck were very few and far between. If the entire entree weighed a pound, half of it was liquid curry and 40 percent of it was pineapple chunks.\\n\\nThe shrimp were butterflied and battered in a coconut flavored breading. You get five for $7 which is fair although I've seen bigger shrimp at Whole Foods for 40 cents each. The disappointment for me was that rather than the expected soy sauce, some almost flavorless weird thick sauce was served with the tempura.

We also had some specific requests afer the food tasting (such as making sure the brisket was not dry) and lo and behold, the brisket was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  The appetizer of chicken diablos were a big hit and vanished rather quickly.  The chicken was delicious as was the grilled asparagus.  The cheesy scalloped potatoes could have been a little softer, but they did get softer with time.  The ranch beans were really yummy too.  Overall it was a magical day for us!

You would think an Italian sub would be difficult to screw up, but their version is now on the top of my worst list.  It's a run of the mill sub bun with little meat, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and hot peppers. I asked for onion instead of tomatoes and peppers. I wasn't told that I would be charged an extra 75 cents for the teaspoon of chopped onion they threw on.  When I questioned the charge on my bill, the waitress had no idea why I was charged $8.25 instead of the $7.50 menu price.  She went to find an answer, came back and said \\"she guessed\\" the additional charge was electronically added because I asked for onions.  So no tomatoes and peppers, plus onions equals a 75 cent up-charge.  I ate only half of my sub because it was so greasy and tasted mostly of over cooked sub bread. I probably won't have an Italian sub from anywhere for awhile due to the bad taste this experience left in my mouth. The waitress was unapologetic and seemed amused that I was confused by the additional charge.  I left an additional star on this review because I've had the spaghetti before and it was pretty tasty.  The menu says your meal comes with rolls, but they don't bring them unless you ask for them. On my first visit we questioned where our rolls were and they brought some out. Last night, we didn't ask and they didn't bring any.

This place had I think 6 flat screens out in the front, a sit down counter area for those eating solo but they have a variety of noodle soups. Your traditional Vietnamese beef noodle then they also have other types like seafood, wonton, etc all sounded good too. Seeing all the pictures makes me drool and I wanted to order everything. Spring rolls, bubble tea, pho, seafood noodle soup, and more....But I guess I'll have to come back for that LOL.\\n\\nSo I came with a group of people and we all ordered their pho and the broth tasted lighter and not as heavy as other places; however, due to its lightness some people may not think it tastes authentic. In other words, not much fat does not equal traditional pho found at home. It's lighter because it's less fat; therefore, a little more healthier and less guilty to eat. I liked it. \\n\\nFor to go, I ordered their banh mi sandwich and for being a foodie like me, I ordered the most than everyone. The bill came to be slightly over $11 and that was just ordering two things but well worth it. Being the first timer here, I'd think this place has room to improve and it's a great location in Bethel. Lots of foot traffic they get here. Anywhooo the banh mi which I ate later in the day was a slightly disappointment. The bread tasted stale which I think makes it stand out from all the other places that serve the same.

This place is great. It leaves you feeling satisfied, but feeling good about yourself instead of feeling like crap after eating unhealthy! I hear this place gets pretty crowded during lunch time so an early or late lunch may be better time to go here. It is a unique salad place that you could make hundreds of combinations. You start off with your base where you get to pick out two things. You can get quinoa, spinach, kale, wild rice, really any type of lettuce you'd want in a salad. You can even combine two different types if you're indecisive. Next, you get 4 toppings. I picked spinach and quinoa as my base, and for my 4 toppings I chose feta, sundried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, and chick peas. There are so many toppings to choose from here, ranging from cheeses, fruits, vegetables and more! I would recommend feta because who doesn't like feta?!? As well as the roasted eggplant had great flavor and helped in filling me up. \\n\\nThey also have proteins to add on if you'd like chicken/ other meats. Personally, I did not add on any, because I figured the chick peas and eggplant would be enough protein for me. They also have craft sodas which are a refreshing change than the normal coke/pepsi products normally offered. I tried their iced passion tea, mixed with one of the lemonade products from the craft soda machine which was super good. I would highly recommend mixing the two if they are offering them!

I pick an entree that is better ordered at an actual Italian, Thai or other ethnic restaurant.  Ineveitably, I am sad as I have definitely had said dish better at the less expensive neighborhood joint.  In the worst case, I could swear the Lean Cuisine frozen version was better.\\n\\n2.  Some member of the staff who happens to be somehow responsible for either seating, serving or bussing my table is confused, oblivious or on break.  If I am successful in picking a tasty entree, somewhere the chain of custody of my dining experience is broken.\\n\\n3.  Lastly - but maybe the most damning factor that dashes my meal if 1 and 2 go well -- my fellow patrons are morons.  Maybe by choosing to dine in the mall I am welcoming this, but it still is just wrong.

I might have forgotten something (you have a ton of things you can add), but the result was extremely tasty, satisfying and healthy!

When I went to place my order the cashier said \\"You're not in a hurry are you?\\"  I waited 15 minutes and still did not get my order.  In the mean time an employee was waiting for other employees to fill orders so he could take them to the tables.  He did nothing to help expedite any orders.  The cashier was the only person I could see actually working and getting food out.  The cashier was putting all the food on the plates with his bare hands.  I thought fast food workers had to wear plastic gloves.  When an order was finally prepared the person who was waiting to hand out the orders and gave the order to the wrong person.  This created total chaos and confusion.

Thought it could have used a couple of more minutes of cook time to produce a more golden and crispy end result. \\n\\nChicken Curry - Sauce was very thin but had a good kick to it. Curry was served with cooked pieces of cabbage and dressed over a large lettuce leaf which I found kind of odd. Chicken pieces were on the dry side as they were all white meat. I actually prefer breast meat but the texture of the chicken was over cooked much like the meat you would find from left over asian slow simmer soups. \\n\\nCurry Laksa -  Served with a couple of fish balls, half hard cooked egg, sprouts, tofu puff and small random bits of chicken breast meat in questionable shapes.

They have some interesting and really awesome menu items such as fried chicken and BBQ dumplings. The food is pretty much always good, I really haven't had too much to complain about. The only thing that holds it back is how rich all of their food is; when I think of Asian food it makes me want to really pig out and that would be a huge mistake here. All of their BBQ renditions of dumplings and ultra fatty noodle dishes will have you second guessing your choices by the time you leave. I recently tried the duck confit fried rice and the bacon and scallop udon dish and the were both really, really good but once I finished eating I would have done anything to undo what I had put into my body! I really comes down to menu variety because there is nothing light and fresh on the menu, its all heavy and rich. If I had the option of not feeling sick every time I ate here I think I would have a different outlook on this place. One or two lighter noodle dishes would do the trick I think. Definitely worth a try. It's a really great after work spot to grab a cocktail and a couple appetizers but keep it small and simple."},{"name":"Hyatt Regency - Austin","address":"208 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is an excellent Hyatt property in downtown Austin.

I've been to most of the best sushi places in town and the freshness here was entirely admirable, regardless of the fact that it's coming out of a trailer. Tried it on a Sunday and no worries on the quality of the fish.\\n\\nA few things to note: I went by and they had a half hour wait to get food, came back in half hour after placing an order and still took another 30 min. I appreciate that they're busy and it's a small place, I think it's still worth it but I would suggest calling ahead and placing an order with at least 30 min to make your life easier.\\n\\nThey didn't have many rolls based around one type of fish, which I feel is preferable for sushi... I can't distinguish the taste of each individual fish when I'm having 3 or more items in it. I asked for what I wanted (made my own roll basically) and tried 2 of their own and all of it was fantastic. \\n\\nMiso soup is yummy and more generous than local sushi joints.

I had the joy of going to the Oasis about 4 years ago and it was a great experience. I was excited to repeat the sentiment, and was sorely disappointed. The view was equally as beautiful as four years ago, however with multiple sacrifices. First the parking situation was a sorry attempt for all I can assume is population control. With two surface lots and a garage parking it was still a farce. We arrived and after waiting in line for 30 minutes were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait. Ok, no problem, to be expected. Then we went next door to the Oasis Brewery (saved for a later review). I must say the shopping area has grown with much diversity and things to do while you wait for your highly anticipated table. After exactly an hour and a half we were escorted to our table. The service was a far cry from desirable. While our waitress tried desperately, she was overworked with far too many tables. Our food was served cold after a 45 minute wait. I was also told there were no knifes available for my chicken.

Most bartenders in this city are of the \\"rum and coke\\" variety - they know the cocktails on their menu, and the basics of combining two, or sometimes (shock!) even three, different kinds of liquid together.  However, at the Diamond, you'll find bartenders who actually seem to care about their trade.  The Old Fashioneds, Manhattans, and Whiskey Sours here are superb.  Absolutely spot on, and with wonderful presentation.\\n\\nThe location is amazing. If you can get one of the tables next to the windows you can people watch from above as bustling Gastown seems oblivious to your existence.

However, I don't understand why many are saying it ruined their entire experience.  The experience of having a custom made cocktail was completely unique, and I chalked up the single cocktail I ordered as just a \\"swing and a miss\\" from the bartender, who was neither rude nor pretentious.  I'd do it again, but maybe The Diamond should make sure customers can turn down (or not pay for) a cocktail if they don't like the taste.\\n\\nAs for the food, its good, but not great.  To be honest, for me, it's just there as snacks to augment the cocktails.  I would not go here for a meal.\\n\\nThe only fault of The Diamond is how expensive it is - but even then, the prices are \\"fair\\" in my opinion.

I had scallops which were forgettable although the pork belly on the plate was tasty.  Unfortunately the sauce, which looked like thin mashed potatoes, was too sweet for the rest of the plate.  For $32 it should have been much better.  The side of mac & cheese we ordered was also mediocre.  My husband had brisket, which looked good but was disappointingly dry. The highlights of the meal were the wedge salad we split and a handmade margarita.  For a $125 meal, everything should have been much better.
