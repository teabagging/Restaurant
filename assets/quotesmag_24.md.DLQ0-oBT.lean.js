I'm talking about decent, not-too expensive places that satisfy you on those days when cooking is just too much effort.  Cheap ethnic and southern food abound for those willing to look.

The Old Spaghetti Factory's there, been there for a while and, hell, spaghetti is right there in the name.  And look, there's a line of people waiting, so it's got to be good!  That's what I call attitudinal inertia.

Located on Fairbanks across from Rollins College, Scratch is a restaurant that has some definite positive and negative characteristics. \\n\\nMy wife and I decided to try to check out Scratch since it was so close to our house and we had heard relatively good things. We looked online to make reservations, and found that you can only make them if you email (what?!) or call during certain hours. We tried calling around 11am on a Saturday morning, but the number listed wouldn't connect. I called several hours later and was able to get the last 7pm spot. Being so popular, we figured the place had to be good.\\n\\nWe drove over to the restaurant and found some street parking since they don't have a parking lot. We walked around the block and got to the front. The restaurant had a cute little sign out front and looked very dark and cutesy from the outside. However, when we went inside, we realized that the place, while unique, was way too small, with a bar taking up half the room and some tables in a very small area. Our server asked for our reservation and took us over to a pre-designated table that was directly by the only other people in the restaurant at that moment. When we asked about moving, we were told that the entire place was going to be full in a matter of moments. Boy was she right.\\n\\nWe sat down and looked over the menu. While we had already looked at the menu online, Scratch is famous for their locally-grown food and a menu that changes a lot. Our server was very pleasant and answered my questions about suggestions (although I noticed she always pushed for us to go with the higher priced item). The menu itself is fairly limited, with half of it consisting of beer and wine (mostly obscure selections) and approximately 15 food items. I would have taken a picture, but the place is rather dark, so I decided to hold off.\\n\\nAs we were looking over the menu, the place did indeed fill up and created one of the most frustrating dining atmospheres I have ever encountered. The tables aren't more than 1 or 2 feet apart, so you are sitting very close to other parties and are barely able to talk (I felt bad for the table that had the large teddy bear taking up even more room as a decoration). Throw in the fact that someone had the idea to blast the radio, and all of a sudden my wife and I could only communicate via text because it was so loud. While the atmosphere wanted to be romantic, the noise and closeness made that virtually impossible.\\n\\nWe decided to get a couple drinks and just have the mussels and brussel sprout salad as our dishes so that we could eat and head out. After placing our order, one of the owners (I believe she had a Spanish accent) stopped by the adjoining table and then our table and wanted to chat everyone up. I don't mind when owners and managers stop by tables (it's usually a good thing), but I'm not looking to have a 5-10 minute conversation when I can barely hear anything to begin with and the whole place is cramped. I'm not trying to be fussy, but the combination of hustle and bustle atmosphere with dark and cutesy and a buzzed owner was just not comfortable at all.\\n\\nAfter waiting a little while longer than I would have liked, our food finally came out. As other reviews have stated, the real strength for Scratch is in its food. The mussels came with bacon and a delicious sauce that made for a solid shareable dish. The brussel spout salad had tasty brussel sprouts, fun secondary ingredients, and was generally fairly pleasant. These dishes would have inspired me to get other dishes if the atmosphere wasn't so uncomfortable.\\n\\nOverall, Scratch is a restaurant that has some of the necessary components (i.e. solid food and service) for success, but has a venue concept that is so flawed that I wouldn't want to go back unless it was during an off-time. The owner told us that the venue had been rented out the following day for just 5 people all to themselves. I hate to say it, but unless you can do the same, I would either avoid this place or order pickup."},{"name":"Ramen Ciro - SW 3rd","address":"432 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I really wanted this to be my new favorite ramen given its sheer affordability, but alas...it falls somewhere closer to third as far as spicy ramens go (it's the only kind of ramen I ever get) after the tonkotsu red from Marukin (specifically the SE location) and the vegan tantanmen from Afuri.\\n\\nThe broth was good (I got a spice level 2 after the guy working said \\"no you don't want 3 it's too spicy) but it was sort of light and lacking some of the rich umami depth I get from the Marukin and Afuri broths. The added spice didn't really add more flavor, just a very light burn. The chashu pork was a little tough (the Marukin one literally melts in your mouth) and under-seasoned for my taste. Cabbage and bean sprouts mostly just add crunch. I added corn and egg to mine (because what is ramen without the soft boiled egg?) and the egg was super creamy and delicious. \\n\\nAfter reading all these rave reviews I was just a little underwhelmed. I missed the toppings I get (for no extra $) at Marukin: the menma (aka super flavorful bamboo shoots), mushrooms, spinach, and leeks. All in all, I paid about $12 including tip. For only $3 more (including 20% tip) I can get my favorite red ramen and a physical restaurant to sit in. I'd give 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed half stars, but I'm settling on Yelp's 3-star description of \\"A-OK\\" for this one."},{"name":"Mary's Cafe","address":"3209 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Waited 45 minutes to get my waffle because they threw my order away without asking if it was anyone's food.

It could not have been better.\\n\\nIn my experience in Vancouver, all the big downtown restaurants that can accommodate large groups will either make you pay ridiculous money for private rooms with a minimum buy, or they'll seat you normally and treat you like you're an unwelcome inconvenience. \\n\\nI thought that because Storm Crow was newer and smaller that they would *want* our business and actually want to show us a good time, and that's exactly what we got. \\n\\nThe first of us arrived to find a very busy but warm and welcoming tavern. This was 7pm on a Friday night - If you don't want to be put on a long wait list, I highly recommend reservations. Our table was set and ready immediately and we were greeted by our server Jeanne who was far and above the best server I've ever had the fortune of meeting. She was prompt, professional, genuine, and most importantly FUN. I don't care how efficiently you do your job if you're a wooden bore. Jeanne got to know us by name and took absolutely fantastic care of me and my guests, despite our occasional seat-changing, my guests coming and going, and her having other tables to take care of at the same time. \\n\\nI can't comment personally about the food but my guests were clearly enjoying surprisingly well-sized portions off the menu where all plates are $6. They ran out of my favorite beer near the end of the night but I have to take at least partial blame for that. One or two more options of the draft menu wouldn't be unwelcome. \\n\\nThe rest of the night was a blast, aside from me losing at a big game of Magic. Jeanne even went out of her way to ask her bosses if she could serve us the cake that one of my friends unexpectedly brought me, and they told her it was no problem. Settling up at the end of the night took no time at all.\\n\\nWe all had a fantastic time. We all agreed that Jeanne was phenomenal.

I ordered the Kalbi Lunch Box, which had an assortment of foods. One of them was what-seemed-to-be mini Italian meatballs in watery marinara sauce. I did not know what to make of it in a Korean restaurant. The kalbi itself was alright; it tasted fine but a little cold.\\n\\nService: It might be their first time opening a restaurant or business but our waitress did not seem to know what she was doing. There were only a few tables at the time we went but she was constantly in a frenzy. She looked anxious and non-attentive for most of the time. It took over 5 minutes to get the attention of our waitress for the bill even though she was less than 7 feet away. Also, when we first came in, we were seated by the entrance because the other ones were filled. We kindly asked the waitress to please close the front door when it was windy and in the 50s outside. It was freezing no doubt. She obliged but within 10 minutes, a different server came and opened the door even wider this time! As we were almost finishing our meal, we didn't bother to ask them to close the door again, since it will probably be our last time walking through them anyways. \\n\\nI am glad there is a new flavor in town but unless their food and especially their service improve, I would happily drive a few extra minutes to Brighton for a much higher quality Korean meal."},{"name":"Lodge at Cascade Brewing","address":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"From the large, open-beam interior space sometimes filled with the aroma of boiling wort, to the fantastically positive service - this place is a winner. Sure I may be biased towards the beers a bit, and especially the rotating sour choices, but almost everything about the Lodge is top-notch. Huge, high quality front projection TV in the kitchen/bar area, beautifully decorated seating spots with one next to a big fireplace, and two stories of areas to relax, enjoy some fantastic brews, and killer grub. Make your choice. \\n\\nBurger selection is great, and the beef tastes fantastic. There is a Buffalo burger on the menu for ~$13, Bleu Cheese Mushroom, and Bacon Avocado, to name a few. Regular or ale-battered fries can add to the caloric uptake, if so inclined. Other items have looked good as well. There full menu is on the web, check it out.\\n\\nThe sour Beer selections rotate on a regular basis, and they offer what is referred to as the \\"Pucker Paddle\\" - a taster of their four sours on tap for $8. Their non-sour beers are also tasty, like the Cascade IPA and the Razberry Wheat. Grenade growlers are $4, and 64oz. growlers are $6. A huge selection of their 750ml. bottles are on sale as well, from $20 on up. Some of their growler fills can get pricey, all depending on your palate and budget ($15 to $50). Figaro, Kriek, Honey Ginger Lime and Blueberry sours were on tap yesterday (11-19-2014). Their Portland Ale and Cascade IPA are available at Happy Hour discounts.\\n\\nThe second floor space is where you need to be for food and drink, but if time allows sneak a peak at the heart of the beer making apparatus on the ground floor. Their prices for their sours might seem high, but factor in the time necessary for these special offerings to come of age (more than 24 months on oak in some cases) and you might begin to understand why the slightly higher price. Barrels are stacked high, patiently waiting to disgorge their contents into receptive glassware of all types. If you are a fan of bacterium beers, this is a must experience.

The beans were a lot better than the rice for me, but the rice still tasted good. \\nMy partner ordered the personal beef fajitas also comes with rice, black beans and tortillas as well. I made a taco with the fajitas on a flour tortilla with all the fixings. I loved the flavor of all the ingredients together; pica de gallo and the guacamole.\\n\\nSo the time comes for dessert, my family had brought a cake for me, but the waitress also bring a slice of flan with a lit candle. Everyone sings happy birthday it was amazing. Now I did not find out until the next day that the flan the waitress brought was on the ticket to pay for... Yet no one ordered that. While this flan tasted great, I don't like the fact that you bring a dessert no one ordered and charge them for that especially if its their birthday. \\n\\nOverall Manuels was a great experience, other than the overcharge.

The black bean burger was hearty.  Temperature wise it was cooler than I would have preferred, but it had a good flavor.  \\n\\nThe fries are the fucking bomb.  They are hand cut shoe string fries and you can get them done up in a variety of ways - garlic/parm, wing sauce/ ranch/ blue cheese, cheesy rotel, pulled pork/ bbq sauce/ cheese- or just get them plain.  You get a huge order so take my advice and don't eat too much of your burger.\\n\\nAll this deliciousness for around $12 and it took 4 minutes from the time I put in the order until the time I was handed my meal.

I had to give it a try. Overall, it was some decent food and a decent value, but nothing spectacular. Let's break it down a bit more:\\n\\nPrice: Very expensive, as you'd expect from most restaurants in the North End, and in particular from a seafood restaurant. Expect to pay ~$40 per entree and ~$15-20 per appetizer. Fair enough, I expected to shell out some dough this night.\\n\\nQuantity: Actually more generous than I thought it would be. I ordered the halibut, the clam bake (aka., 2 lb lobster with clams and chorizo), and the buttered lobster roll. I was pleasantly surprised with the generous portions with each dish. Boston restaurants typically try to skimp on quantity, and this one definitely gave you actual full-meal portions. Very nice.\\n\\nQuality: This is where things fell off a bit. The quality of the ingredients? Fantastic and fresh. The quality of the cookery? Not very impressed. Aside from the lobster roll, everything was absolutely overcooked. Halibut is a naturally delicious fish (hence why it's one of the priciest fish on the market) and it's quite easy to make this a nice and flaky fish. However, the fish turned out chunky instead of flaky (the most obvious and prominent sign that any piece of fish is overcooked). It actually became tedious to eat after the first several bites because it was just dry chunks of flesh instead of succulent, delicate flakes. I became thirsty after every bite because it was so dry. Lobster was also baked for far too long. The tail and claw meat were rubbery and dry and lost the unique taste of the sea that you expect from lobster flesh because it all evaporated out from being overcooked. Also the sauce that everything was basted/cooked in was just not that great. It's basically one of those spicy tomato-garlic-butter bases that you often use to steam mussels. Just not very flavorful, didn't pair well with the lobster meat, and everybody at the table agreed they'd have preferred a regular steamed lobster dipped in regular old butter (which would have also cost us far less). Lobster roll was solid.\\n\\nFor a restaurant with so much hype behind it, and at the price point I paid, I honestly did expect a bit more out of this place, but I don't regret trying it. It's worth a shot if you have the money to shell out (no pun intended), but I just feel like the cooks are way too busy trying to get food out as fast as possible to really pay attention to how well each dish is actually being made (there seems to always be a line)."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Let's put aside how OVERRATED this place is first, and talk about how RUDE the hostess is.

When the hostess came back around, she said \\"too bad, you missed your spot since you didnt pick up\\". WTF. I was standing right outside. We continued to wait since our party wanted to try it. They will continue to be a busy TOURIST TRAP regardless of this review, but my two cents anyway. The managers need to get their staff in line.

A prime setup for late night cocktails and dancing. There were only a few tables for dining. We had a long table to accommodate our large party, and there were two or three other smaller tables to seat parties of three or four people. \\n\\nOur server was extremely sweet - he answered our questions about portions sizes, and offered suggestions based on his favorite dishes. He clued us in on the small portion sizes which was helpful. Many of the plates (aside from the burgers) are tapas sized. Drink orders took a bit long to be delivered to the table, but that was pretty expected given the size of our party.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our meals, we experienced one of those awkward \\"set the mood\\" moments when the lights went a little bit dimmer, and the room got a little bit darker, and we all paused mid conversation to look around in confusion.

And I don't mean just a minute or two later than everyone else. I'm talking a good ten to twelve minutes later.

But my excitement was pretty short-lived. The octopus was just so-so. It was tender, but did not have much flavor to it. There was only one tentacle (which our server had warned me), so it was not especially filling. The steamed veggies (green beans) were decent, but a little buttery for my taste.\\n\\nI thought that the atmosphere and setting were more conducive to a night out for drinks rather than a sit down dinner for a mediocre meal of small portioned, semi-pricey plates.

When my second friend came he ordered a Fireball shot...which turned into 3 over the evening. When it came time to pay the bill there was a discrepancy; we were charged for 8 fireball shots when he had only had 3. We made the discrepancy known to our waitress who brought her incompetent manager over. He refused to listen to us, saying we had been there since before kickoff and questioned if he had in fact drank 8 fireballs. We repeatedly told him that only one of our friends had drank fireball and that he swears he only drank 3. The manager - Tommy or Chris - refused to believe us and ended up calling Saugus Police to respond almost immediately. We had a minor discrepancy with the bill, a $15 difference, that in no way needed police response. We were escorted out of the restaurant and forced to pay the incorrect bill. Most reputable establishments would have corrected the bill, especially when we had correctly ordered over $300 worth of food and drinks. Beware coming here!

You may do a double take when you see the prices are between $4 and $6 per dim sum, but if you get your order in before 11am, it's 25% off. And afterwards, it's 20% off. I'm not sure why places do this, as opposed to just making things cheaper in general on their menu, but it ends up being decently priced.\\n\\nThe lack of a star is due to the fact that the other dim sum we ordered wasn't stellar.

They have several flavours of slurpee-nothing like the selection at Mac's. Coke, cream soda, orange soda are always available. Recently, they've added another machine, and have more 'adult' flavours- mocha, french vanilla..There's the choice of different sizes, as well as 'doubling up' on the soft serve. \\n\\nMy favourite has got to be the orange Screamer. Orange soda slurpee with thick creamy soft serve, all in one cup. This is like a orange Creamsicle, but drinkable. \\n\\nTry it at least once, and you won't be disappointed!!"},{"name":"Ramen Ciro - SW 3rd","address":"432 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Five stars and here's why: \\n\\nfor the price and quality, you canNOT beat it!

The night started off slightly disappointing, but ended up picking up soon afterward and ended on a fairly positive note. \\n\\nWe opted to go for valet parking since it was only $5 and the streets were a bit crazy. However, the valet was nowhere to be found, and after waiting for almost 10 minutes, we decided to try circling around the block one more time to see if any spots open up. No luck there, but the valet magically reappeared when we returned, so we dropped off the car and went inside. \\n\\nWe were promptly seated, and our server was incredibly friendly. More importantly, she was very thorough with checking in with the chef regarding some dietary restrictions we had, which I really appreciated since I've had problems (not here, but at other places) about this in the past. The only thing that I have a minor complaint about was that towards the end of the night, when she was clearing away our plates, she spilled quite a bit of sauce from one of our dishes, and it almost got on us. Obviously an accident, and she was very apologetic about it, so I'm not too bothered. \\n\\nWith regards to food, we ordered the: \\n\\nAlmejas con Miso - Clam miso soup. Perhaps the only disappointing dish of the night. The soup itself was so salty that it was impossible to drink. The clams were tasty, but they only give three (and would've done much better in a lighter soup). \\n\\nAlbondiga - Lamb and beef meatball. I didn't get to try this because it had some ingredients I can't have, but my friend states that it was very tasty. \\n\\nCerdo - Grilled pork medallion. Would probably recommend; it's the right blend of savory and sweet and is also quite a generous portion. \\n\\nCostillas - Braished beef short ribs. Fairly standard; very good, but not necessarily unique. \\n\\nMejillones con Chorizo - Sauteed mussels. My favorite dish of the night. The sauce is extremely savory without being too overwhelming, and the mussels were cooked just right. We ended up dipping a lot of our complimentary bread in this sauce because of just how good it was. \\n\\nMousse De Caramelo Y Chocolate - Salty caramel and dark chocolate mousse. Didn't really taste the caramel, but the mousse was nice and fluffy. Pretty solid, but nothing to rave about. \\n\\nTarta De Queso - Orange pistachio cheesecake. Very good level of pistachio flavoring, and the cheesecake itself was very creamy, but it's nothing too special. \\n\\n\\nOverall, not a bad option for tapas, and I definitely enjoyed myself, but it doesn't really stand out to me save for the mussel dish that we ordered.

Congress.  Grandma had the Pinto so we had to bike it (well, I rollerbladed while he pulled me on the bike).  I have to say even though this place was low on the babes and no on the deep frying, it was definitely high on Blood Alcohol Level (BAL) and cholesterol (HDL & LDL) - - which is perfect for a couple of chick magnets like us.  I mean, we need a break too ya know.  I've got some serious carpeltunnel action going on.   \\n\\nMags (so I call it) has no fryers, so that means no fried chicken or french fries or awesome blossom or fried chitlins + crow gizzards, but they still managed to make up for it in other ways.  We wanted to go easy on our arteries, so instead of the Spinach Artichoke Dip (cream cheese + parmesan + tomatoes) at $6.96 we instead opted for the Sonora Queso Chips n' Sauce ($7.25) which is like Grandma's Velveeta in a bowl w/ ground beef, advocado and pico de gallo.  It's a yeller cheese compared to Kerby's white cheese queso, so if yeller's your thing then go for it.\\n\\nAfter that I went for the Magna Cristo (thanks to Jennie C), it's got turkey, ham, swiss, bacon, advocado, tomato, grilled on italian white bread for $8.50.  I needed the protein since I bench press something like 400lbs.  Napolean went for the Tropical Turkey Tacos (he's watching his waistline - - what a girl).  One taco = $5.75; 2 tacos = $7.25 (DUH!  Get ONE you idiot, it's less expensive and smaller portion size).  It's got smoked turkey, jack cheese, pineapple, advocado (yeah, advocados everywhere), pico de gallo on a wheat tortilla.  I've had them before too and can concur w/ his comment:  damn tasty.  \\n\\nThe homefries here are greasier than Kerby's, so I guess that's where they make up for not having fryers.  The lemonade isn't sweet (very tart), so you gotta add the blue or pink or yeller or white packet if you want it sweet (I prefer pink because it's a more asthetically pleasing packet).  The pancake syrup was very runny, I guess it must be the cheap shit (White Aunt Jemima) or they dilute the hell outta it so it goes a long way (I like to dip my Mag Cristo in syrup - - don't laugh - - you should try it sometime, just the same as your french toast + bacon in syrup!).  What the heck it all goes in one tube anyway.  \\n\\nWe noticed this specific location is extremely loud, conversations carry easily, so we had to be covert in communicating about what chat rooms have the best babes and how Grandma's quesa-dillaz give us heartburn and indigestion (I'm lactose intolerant - - not funny).  The waitstaff and manager (Chuck or Chuckles) was very nice and down to business.  No touchy-feely here since it's a smaller operation and looks like they had a skeleton crew so there was a plethora of multi-tasking going on.  It wasn't as clean as Kerby's but we didn't mind cuz you know us chick magnets like it Dur-tay w/ a capital \\"D\\"!\\n\\nOverall it was a pretty good experience - - not awesome (like LaFawnda) - - but good enough to visit again.

So thats what I did!! I served myself some special chicken salad with raisins and carrots and a mayo base... this was really good!  \\n\\nAnother thing I went for was the fish stew. I actually thought it was chicken as it looked like it, so it was a bit of a surprise, but a good one. The stew had fish (obviously), carrots, potatoes, and scallions. Just be warned... it will leave you smelling a bit fishy.\\n\\nI also had the beans and rice which were really good.... very similar to Colombian beans and rice. They also had another section which had beans, bacon, some greens, and some yucca powder? Anyway, it was REALLY good! Def give that one a try.\\n\\nThe chicken they had was very good, it was so tender it fell off the bone and it was extremely savory. Loved it!\\n\\nA couple of side dishes that should not be missed are the sweet plantains and the yucca. Those really hit the spot and they really scream home to me even though I'm Colombian. But honestly, once you hit South America the food is very similar. \\n\\nOverall this place was great. The staff is real friendly and the place is clean. Sure....it's not like one of those fancy all you can eat meat feasts that are associated with Brazilian food.  This is more of a Brazilian mom and pop restaurant that serves Brazilian home cooked meals. \\n\\nOh! One last thing.... make sure you try the coconut juice in a can with coconut bits inside.

My meal came about five minutes later which, was a simple burger and fries. It comes out by another girl and we didn't see our server for another twenty minutes. We had to ask another server to get our server, just to get refills on drinks and some ketchup. The service is absolutely horrible. She tells us she's sorry because she was in the middle of shift change. We saw her talking to two other employees in the kitchen the whole time as if they were hanging out. She never told us about drink specials (we heard them from another server at another table), didn't ask for our rewards card that we idiotically signed up for on our second visit, when she brought us the bill.

I can look out my window and see the front entrance.  I stopped in just after 6:00 p.m. on a Monday evening, and upon entering saw that less than 1/4 of the tables were sat for the evening, with no persons waiting in the small area reserved for such a purpose.  I asked what I thought would be a rhetorical question - \\"do you have room for one\\" - as there was obviously copious amounts of room for one person.  I was told \\"no\\" - that it would \\"soon be the dinner rush...\\" - It did not occur to the person telling me this to find a time when I might come back, or suggest that I order take out, etc.  It also evidently did not occur to him that a person dining alone does not linger and would likely eat and be back out the door before any of his seemingly more important (and absent) guests arrived.\\n\\nHe evidently did not want my business which is really too bad considering I am a professional, 42 year-old, single, person living directly across the street - who eats out most nights of the week.  I appreciate fine cuisine and budget monthly for significant discretionary income outlays to fine dining.  Bondir would have received a great amount of my business - if they had just wanted it.  I won't step foot in there again - and I will counsel my friends and colleagues to remove it as an option when considering which place they might try in Cambridge.  Seriously - in a metropolitan area with so very many amazing choices for dining, the real item that an establishment has to rely upon beside outstanding fare is the customer service.  They would do well to remember the adage - \\"people may not remember what you say, and they may not remember what you do - but they will always remember how you made them feel...\\" - They made me feel like I wasn't good enough (although wearing professional clothing) to eat in their restaurant.

So I'm giving it a 4 to average it out. I had high hopes for the paella since everyone seems to rave about it. Since we had a vegetarian in the party, we got the Paella de Verduras one, and I wasn't blown away. The rice wasn't even crispy on the bottom and it was quite bland...won't be getting that one again. We also ordered the hummus, bistec con cebollas (sirloin steak with caramelized onions, arugula, and crispy onions), and patatas bravas (basically French fries covered in a tomato sauce and aioli). I enjoyed the steak the best, but it sure was a tiny piece for $16. I wasn't a huge fan of the hummus or the patatas. I prefer mediterranean-style hummus and didn't like how the fries were drowning in sauce. I think I'd come back to give it another chance, but would definitely go on the first Tuesday of the month to get the special price on tapas. Otherwise, it's a little pricey for dinner.\\n\\nWe had initially chosen this place since people rave about the outdoor patio and we wanted to get together for happy hour. Unfortunately, you can't get happy hour out on the patio. It's only at the bar. We ordered drinks, cashed out, then took them with us to the patio to make it work. The patio was gorgeous with perfect weather so this ended up working out really well.

This in turn led to a very loud obnoxious shouty environment, and though there were a few as 15 people inside the restaurant. \\n\\nAnyhow, I received my breakfast without my steak, the steak arriving just minutes later. I must say, I was very impressed by how satisfying it was considering it being half the price of Denny's or IHOP. The eggs were fluffy, the hash browns were crisp.

Next time - calamari. :-)\\n\\nFor dinner, my wife had porchetta, a dish you don't find on menus too often. Essentially it's a pork belly wrapped around a pork loin. It was substantial in size and very good if a bit unusual-tasting. Not sure if I'd want a whole meal of that. My wife loved it. I had steak frites (love steak and fries) and it was cooked medium rare, just the way I like it. Fries were generous.\\n\\nCon - Service was slow because they \\"had a big party.\\" But they were by no means surly about it.

It probably would have been nice if they offered us a free dessert or something but, well, no big deal. \\n\\nSo back to that toolbag and his useless review. Remember how he said they \\"charge steakhouse prices?\\" Actually, no. A steakhouse would run you into at least the low-to-mid $100's. (A steak at Abe and Louis in Boston will run you 50 bucks easy.) This place? $85 before tip. For two. Now we didn't have any alcohol so factor that in. But 85 bucks for a good restaurant smack dab in the heart of Boston? Come on. Reasonable. \\n\\nI didn't give the place 4 stars largely due to slowness of service.

Located in the heart of Avondale Estates,  it is surprisingly hip for its quiet neighborhood, and it provides a much-needed trendy but elevated dining option for this charming corner of Atlanta. We were immediately impressed by the ambiance and decor- it's a small, cozy restaurant, with lots of natural light and interesting artwork. The brunch menu is small but innovative, and there were several vegetarian options I would have been excited to try. I settled on the flatbread- a toasted pita, smeared with hummus and topped with salad, olives, pepperoncini, and over-easy eggs. It was good with a slightly Mediterranean flavor profile. She had the Kickstart, their version of a two-egg breakfast. The menu says no modifications to brunch items, but our nice waitress subbed out bacon for some absolutely delicious hash browns with no issue. It also came with scrambled eggs, tasty white grits and a huge crispy but chewy biscuit. Although the food was good, I will venture to say that their simple but well-executed brunch cocktail menu really made our experience great. I started with a well-seasoned Bloody Mary and she had a refreshing Paloma. We followed that up with an elegant French 75 for her and a delightful Old Friend for me, a mix of gin, grapefruit, Campari and St. Germain. We loved having the option of ordering several different cocktails with our meal, instead of the usual old mimosa. Rising Son is worth a visit to this part of town, and is easily the best restaurant in the area. Enjoy!"},{"name":"RusTeak Restaurant & Wine Bar","address":"1568 Maguire Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"The best!! We go here for many date nights!

I ended up with a HUGE portion of sautéed steak, yellow rice and plantains. The food was delicious. There was so much I took half home to enjoy the next day. I splurged and brought home a piece of their Tres Leches cake which I shared with my husband. The cake was very good but not the best I've ever had.

I tried the table sauce options and both were good.  Nothing is be writing home about, but good.  We also had the pulled pork, and tried the veggie combo, cole slaw, French fries, and baked beans.  The ribs stole the show.  The pork was tender and better with sauce.  The sauce was sweet and could have used a kick to make it pop.  The mixed grilled veggies were also a hit.  Fabulous mix of Brüssel sprouts and sweet potatoes among others.  The charred crispy edges were perfection.  The beans were...just ok.  The fries were fresh and well made shoestrings.  We finished with beignets.  They were decent, but if you compare to Cafe Du Monde from Nola, you'll be disappointed.  They were good, not greasy.  A bit more chewy than I expected.

No matter how weird Portland gets, Pine St. just keeps it real with good ol' fashioned chicken and biscuits. A definite must-try if you're visiting PDX. \\n\\nGetting a table is a bit tricky because this place is so popular but there are communal tables outside where you can huddle up next to some nice Portlanders. \\n\\nSome things to consider ordering:\\nReggie Deluxe - Massive -- the entire farm is in this sandwich it seems. You'll be staring at a tower of fried chicken breast, crackling bacon, a big, runny egg, and a healthy oozing slice of American cheese. Then they absolutely drench it with a substantial and delicious gravy. All of this sandwiches between these fluffy and golden biscuits touched by some amazing butter. Truly one of the finest American inventions of our generation.\\n\\nThe Chatfield - for those wanting a bit of sweet in their savory, this is essentially the Reggie but with Apple Butter jam. If I had to do it over, I'd get something else. It's good and a nice change of pace but its not the masterpiece that the Reggie Deluxe is.\\n\\n\\nFor drinks:\\n\\nTheir coffee will always be special rotating guest roaster and you can always get Stumptown coffee from them.\\n\\nBut what I really enjoyed was their Gourmet Hot Chocolate with marshmallow. This isn't your ordinary hot cocoa w/ marshmallows. Its not those tiny Kraft marshmallows that melt upon entry to the cocoa. Nope, this is a hunk of marshmallow that is expertly crafted and so creamy and delicious. The cocoa itself is liquid chocolatey heaven. I grew up on Swiss Miss instant cocoa packets and Pine State's hot cocoa is easily about a million times better.\\n\\nIt's gonna be messy but no worries because everyone around you is happily stuffing their faces as well! The food is so good, so filling, and so hearty -- its the perfect antidote for the cold Northwest weather. \\n\\nTip: If you're not tapped out by the mountain of food, go to Portland's famous Salt & Straw ice cream for a great dessert.

Do not go in there expecting a full meal, because you will leave hungry. \\n\\nThe Golden Eagle is a pretty good bar with a great selection of cocktails. It has a great atmosphere with a laid-back vibe and superb mid-century styling. It's a nice place to drink or just hang out. The staff are hip (if you're into that sort of thing), interesting, and helpful. That's all good. \\n\\nThe downside is that the menu is tiny, the portions are small, and the food prices are high. They openly describe the food as tapas, but I'd say the portion is even smaller than that. A few of the small selection of dishes are pretty good, but many of them are over-engineered with ingredients even foodie's might have to google, and the rest are just bland and uninteresting. On our most recent visit I spent $256 on a \\"dinner\\" for five (3-4 drinks included) and every one of us left hungry. To make matters worse, the table seating is ridiculous. It's uncomfortable and the majority of tables are really too small to handle too many plates at one time. There's enough legitimate seating for only a handful of people, and if you don't get one of those tables, you'll be eating your food out of your lap. And, naturally, they don't take reservations. \\n\\nThe lesson here is simple: don't get suckered into thinking that this is a place that you should go to for dinner or any complete meal, or you will leave disappointed. But if you're into hipster-upscale, try out the drinks and the atmosphere, and maybe try a snack or two while you're at it. It's a decent bar, but as a restaurant it needs a major overhaul."},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Would definitely give this place a higher review if it wasn't for our terrible waitress!

Neptune is probably one of the best restaurants in Boston, not just the North End. Be forewarned, the dining space is so so tiny that you are bound to bump into other patrons around you several times as you meander around inside. God help you if you are a big person!\\n\\nAs many have said, they don't take reservations (or take-out orders) but since I live in the North End, this is no problem for me. I just go put in my name and number and just go back to my place to wait it out. The rest of you, there are plenty of bars around you can go grab a drink while you wait. Just keep in mind that with this place's reputation, it is always slammed so you're going to have to fight through the crowds to get inside to flag down the host to put your name down. Be prepared to be ignored or not be treated as a priority because, let's face it, this place is doing fine for itself and doesn't need to go out of it's way to put more people on their wait list. If you can get over this fact that they aren't going to bend over backwards for you, you're going to have a good time...\\n\\nAs the name should indicate, this place has be best selection of bi-valves anywhere in the city. My all-time favorite are Kumamoto's and to my knowledge, only Neptune carries this variety in Boston. The clam chowder is traditional and authentic. Real clam chowder is suppose to be soupy and on the thinner side. You've all been deceived into thinking it's meant to be thick. You get bites of clam and big clam flavor in every spoonful.\\n\\nWhile the lobster roll here is the main attraction for a lot of people, I prefer their scallop entree dish which they execute perfectly. I also enjoy their fried clams too as they taste super fresh. If ordering fries as a side or if it comes with your dish, it's a heaping generous portion. I feel that they way oversalt them so I've never been able to finish a whole side order by myself.\\n\\nDon't expect to leave this place without spending at least $50 per person and that is lowballing it.

On the second day of my trip, I used my handy dandy Yelp app and it led me to Luke's Lobster Back Bay. This casual eatery is perfect for lunch, just place your order at the counter, pick out a drink from the refrigerator, grab a seat and within minutes the server brings you food. \\n\\nThe simple menu offers three types of seafood rolls (lobster, crab or shrimp), salad, chowder, and chilled lobster tails. They rearrange things into several combinations of rolls, soups and/or drinks making it versatile enough for any seafood lover. The only downside is that they only serve New England style lobster rolls which are chilled instead of warm. I ordered mine with no mayo.\\n\\nThe sandwich was excellent. The warm brioche bread was stuffed with chunks of tender, perfectly cooked lobster in a warm lemon butter. I enjoyed the bread because it was really light and airy which allowed me to focus on the lobster flavor. \\n\\nThese lobster rolls contain 4 ounces of lobster meat, and I could not stop at just one. I enjoyed the second roll just as much as the first and I could have gone for thirds if I did not have a dinner party that evening.\\n\\nI highly recommend Luke's and would happily give them 5 stars if they offered warmed up lobster in the rolls, but this is a 4.5 star restaurant, the real deal.

Some of the dishes I really liked (trout) but the majority were either okay or not at all to my taste. It started off with a number of very tiny appetizers (some were comically small) and ended with two large dishes, the trout and the bison tongue.  Now I don't like tongue to begin with (probably should have asked the server to exclude this from our tasting menu) but the presentation was super weird - a large slab of tongue with a hot piece of butter lettuce over it, with asiago cheese on top. Like, what? The piece of lettuce got very slimy, it was just not good. (A more global comment, I also don't think you should include bison tongue on a tasting menu, since a lot of people don't like it.)\\n\\nOverall we got more than 7 dishes, I think a total of 9 or 10. So in terms of amount of food it was decent value for $40 but there were some odd choices. One of the dishes was kohlrabi which was 3 tiny slices of kohlrabi. Tongue dish mentioned above. Another was scallops which were raw - another strange choice for a tasting menu as these really aren't that common. \\n\\nOn the plus side, the vibe in here was really great on a Friday evening.

I tried to ask her a question a few more times and she was just too preoccupied with everything else to bother with a table for 2.

And sometimes, if we're running late, they'll actually put the pizza back in the oven after it's ready. Wonderful.\\nThe only reason I take a star off is that their tomatoes are usually horrible, even in the peak of tomato season.

I wasn't overwhelmed by my meal but I would go back if someone else wanted. I did not try their lobster roll, shrimp roll or crab roll they are known for. My meal was paired with a classic Maine blueberry lemonade which was delicious. The beverage I selected from a variety of bottled options that included a ginger beer and a Mexican cola.

I ordered chicken tenders, which tasted more like cardboard than chicken. They were dry and the breading had little to no seasoning. The French fries had a good taste, however those too, were hard to eat because they came on my plate almost glued together. Completely impossible to eat one at a time. The fried pickles we got as an app seemed to only be fried on one side, though the sauce that came with them was excellent. Another person in my party also got the chicken tenders and agrees with my critique of the dish.

Legend has it, on Valentine's Day one year, Tom Cruise actually brought Kat--alright, I'll stop there. Perhaps a bad example. But trust me: Love is in the air at Narcoosee's, and so are Magic Kingdom fireworks, if you are smart with your reservation time! \\n\\nWhere is Narcoosee's? It's that restaurant with the lights lining the roof, as you head from the Grand Floridian's main building towards the Seven Seas Lagoon. A pretty little secret. The food is seafood and steak and beautiful. Each dish on the menu is listed with both a wine and beer pairing. The portions are huge, but still get a starter because the plates are so delicious. \\n\\nBeginning with the Artisinal Cheese Selections, my mouth was transported to little villages and farms that dot their cheese with lavender or exciting rinds, yet still pair their cheese with pickles. The cheese pairings are how I judge a cheese platter. Sure, the cheese can be amazing, but how about its friends?l Narcoosee's did not disappoint, with pickles, honeycomb, apricot jam, and peanut brittle. Disney cheese plates are also great for their stories. Tete de Moine came looking like cheese petals--invented at an Abbey eight centuries ago, this cheese is cut with a special machine called a girolle. I delight in being educated while I eat, and Disney does not disappoint. \\n\\nCraving iron after pounding the pavement of Main Street USA, I ordered a perfectly cooked filet mignon, that arrived with a beefy-wine reduction, whipped potato, and giant beans. Also ordered were just-as-perfect scallops, dancing around spaetzle-like dumplings. \\n\\nWhat made the night so special was that Narcoosee's pumps in the Wishes soundtrack just as your view of Magic Kingdom lights up with fireworks in the sky. The wrap-around porch has one of the best views of Wishes that I have ever seen, but we were lucky to have a table that looked right out to the magic. \\n\\nNarcoosee's is tucked away and seems at first glance like a nantucket, shutters and fishnet seafood place. The views of the Seven Seas Lagoon, Wishes, and delicious cuisine, however, remind you that Disney's magic is near, making it a truly special place."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Def not for the faint of heart, but if you enjoy fried chicken and biscuits & gravy, I would recommend checking out Pine State Biscuits.\\n\\nI ordered the Reggie deluxe with topped & smothered fries and a fried green tomato. I also got to try the hash up, chicken pot pie, and Chatfield.  The food is HEAVY, but the execution is more or less good.  My favorite component of the food is definitely their gravy - well balanced with plenty of sausage.  Their fried chicken is good, and my egg was cooked perfectly; however, I would have liked the bacon a little crispier, or just no bacon - it's just not necessary when you have the egg.  The fried green tomato I could go without ordering again, but I did enjoy the topped & smothered fries.  They aren't super crispy, but its probably better that they aren't overly fried as everything else on the menu.\\n\\nFrom what I sampled, I liked all of the other menu items I tried.  When I come back, I will probably still stick with the biscuit sandwiches, but maybe sub out the egg or bacon.  I had some of the drink specials for the day, but they were watered down - although it's nice that they have a full bar.\\n\\nPrices are good; I probably spent more here than at other Portland restaurants just to try everything, but I'm not complaining too much.

It's also great to have another place to eat here in the shopping plaza.  Very positive.  They have outdoor seating and share some of their space (tiny fence divides it) with the Brass Tap.  It was neat because you could order beer from BT and food from Slapfish.\\n\\nThe less good was that it was fairly expensive for what you got.  It wasn't insane or anything, but a little steeper than the quality of food that we got.\\n\\nWe each ordered a starter and a main.  The food didn't come out that way and that was weird.  It also didn't come out all together.  The place was mildly busy, but there were many tables empty, so you can't throw it all on that.\\n\\nMe: street taco and clobster grilled cheese\\nHer: shrimp ceviche and poke bowl\\n\\nThey came out: it took about 10 minutes for the poke bowl to come out, 10 minutes later the shrimp ceviche starter, 5-10 minutes later the street taco and the grilled cheese came at the same time.  So I sat there and watched my wife eat for 15-20 minutes.  At least I was starving by the time it came out!\\n\\nI asked if you could get the street taco on a flour tortilla instead of a corn tortilla and was told no.  I then ordered the lobster taquitos which ARE on a flour tortilla and asked if they were a different size tortilla than the corn ones for the street tacos.  He said \\"No, they are the same size.\\" To which I then asked \\"WAIT... so why can't you use the flour tortilla for the street taco if they are the same size?\\"  He asked someone else and eventually said \\"I'm not sure how they'll do it, but the manager said we can try.\\" \\n\\nI'm not sure what to think about that answer. That seems like an awfully wimpy answer to an entry-level question.  Turns out they did a perfectly fine job of it.  It was a delicious grilled fish taco on a wheat flour tortilla.  AMAZINGLY THEY PULLED IT OFF! It was sketchy and it almost didn't happen, but they did it.\\n\\nThe clobster grilled cheese was also excellent.  I wasn't sure it would work, but it did!  It was good.\\n\\nAnother big disappointment for me was the fries and tortilla chips.  They were seasoned so heavily that it was like taking the cinnamon challenge from a few years ago.  You could cough dust after each bite.  Interestingly, this is so common with seasoned fries at many places that I actually asked for my fries WITHOUT seasoning.  I asked if it was a big deal and he said \\"No way.  We have kids fries without all day long, so it's no big deal.  Our kids fries have no seasoning and they are the same fries.  \\" I appreciated that, but it didn't come to pass because I got heavily seasoned fries instead.\\n\\nMy wife said the ceviche was passable, but lacking punch.  She also said it didn't actually seem like ceviche, but cooked shrimp in a red sauce.  I was confused by the tortilla chips with this and she didn't eat more than a couple of them because they were so heavily coated in seasoning.  Seriously, the fries and chips weren't \\"dusted\\" they were SWAMPED.  It was heavy.\\n\\nShe liked the poke bowl.  She was also amused by the random food items in the bowl.  It was really random from my view.  Typically, poke bowls are rice, sushi chunks, some julienned veggies, and sauce.  She was pulling all sorts of things out of hers.  Including a bunch more of those seasoning-plastered tortilla chips!  She tossed most of those out and since I was waiting so long, I started brushing them off and putting them in the DELICIOUS habanero salsa they had.  (EXCELLENT hot sauce and condiment bar, FYI) It was like a food treasure hunt.  The bowl had some lettuce, lots of radish, random veggies, rice, and she was laughing as she pulled each new item out from the depths.  \\"WHOA, GIANT ONION!\\"  \\"WHOA, IS THIS SPINACH?\\" \\"HEY THERE RADISH FARM!\\" It was the most entertaining part of dinner.  She complimented the fish, as well.\\n\\nYou might want to make sure you understand the hipster fountain drinks before you spend your money on one.

I lived in Orlando for 3 years and the competition there was tight. Sabor Do Brasil has a excellent staff. They are kind and inviting.  My wife and I came here for a early dinner around 530pm. The variety of meats is once again adequate. They have sirloin , garlic sirloin, pork Sudafed , bacon wrapped : chicken , sirloin &pork. Finally they also had chicken hearts !!! We do not eat pork so the lack of a chicken item was a bit disappointing but not a deal breaker. The garlic sirloin was really good!! The chicken hearts were Ben better. I think I ate like 30. The hot and cold bar were not bad at all. Since we went during a slow period the food could have been better but when they brought out fresh replacements they were good. They have this chicken lasagna thing ....try it out you won't be disappointed. For around $15 a head for dinner the place is fair . We would come again.

We were in Beaverton yesterday and stopped in at this location for a small pizza. First off, the place is crawling with kids due to birthday parties...which I get, but there were so many un-bussed tables and it was just dirty. Secondly, we ordered a small (10 inch) pizza with pepperoni and sausage. The prices were very high, in my opinion. A small pizza with just cheese on it starts at $12.90. It is an additional $2.20 for each meat topping we added. So our small pizza was over $17. Soft drinks were $2.75 each, so now we are up over $20. What really burned me, though, is that when you go to pay with a credit card, a tip is automatically added in...you just choose the percentage and the smallest percentage is 15%. We did not see an option for no tip, so with the $3.42 tip we are now up to a whopping $26.22 for a small two topping pizza and two soft drinks. That's ridiculously over priced in my opinion. Really...That is a 15% tip for the kid at the register to take my order? I had to get up to get the pizza when our number was called so there was no table service. I am all for tipping for good service, but I don't consider this \\"service\\" and I really resent the fact that I am not given an option to choose to tip, but rather I am being forced to tip. Gratuities should be optional. Even if the tips are pooled, I think it is the responsibility of the restaurant to pay their counter staff and cooks a decent wage rather than forcing customers to subsidize it. I am giving them one star because that is the least I can give and the pizza was good; however, we won't be back after this experience. We can get a large pizza closer to home for the same price...and they bring it out to the table."},{"name":"Wegmans","address":"53 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Beautiful grocery that unfortunately is plagued by extremely poor supply chain management.

Place sits in really cool Liberty Hotel which is in the old Charles Street Jail and each spot inside is a jail theme, with exposed brick/jail bars etc. This restaurant is pretty large inside, the largest of all the bars/restaurants in the hotel. The walls are lined with all sorts of awards and recognition which is always a good sign. \\n\\nHostess station at first was a bit disorganized and there were 3 hostess which seemed like a lot but this place is busy and jammed on a Saturday night so I can see the reason. The interior of this place is pretty cool, with a very large open kitchen with a pizza oven etc and another larger bar at the other end with seating at each and all around, booths and tables. The wait staff here was busy and kept up with the demand and was actually pretty attentive throughout the meal. They have a creative cocktails menu with some pretty tasty drinks from margaritas to matinees. As for food, this place really gets it right with handmade breads of all sorts, a mozzarella bar containing various mozzarella dishes and tons of starters from seafood to meat. We chose a very delicious 4 cheese bread, tomato and mozzarella with balsamic and some very nice calamari. Everything hit the spot and the bread was unreal. \\n\\nEntrees range from pastas to steaks to seafood and ravioli etc. I chose a very nice veal loin with some really nice risotto and it was of course delicious. Other orders included a very large Pork Chop, suckling pig ravioli and a nice cut of steak with duck fat fries. Everything was cooked right and hit the spot. Dessert was even better with a dark chocolate tart with salted caramel ice cream and a sour cream blueberry cake with ice cream which all hit the spot. In the end this place really was worth it and I can see why it is always booked and hard to come by a reservation.

I hadn't had new orleans style food in years so I was game. \\nEveryone was very friendly.   The waitress was a little forgetful in not bringing coffee that was ordered with the Beignets, but the yumminess of the food made up for it.  \\nIt was a tough decision on what to order.  They were out of a few things, but that only tells me there it was fresh and the patrons that got their for earlier lunch beat me out of it. \\nWe looked at what the big party had ordered.   The PoBoys were piled high with big fried shrimp...first reaction was \\"WOW\\" and the Muffaletta sandwiches were 3 inches tall and took up an entire plate.... go with the half sandwich.   Can't wait to go back and try those out. \\nI ordered the Crawfish Etouffee because it is something that I rarely have because I am a believer that you have to be in New Orleans to get that dish prepared right.   Pappadeaux makes a horrible Crawfish Etoufee.  The Beignet Connection's verion had just the right amount of spiciness (some chefs will throw in a bunch of cayenne because they think hotter must mean more authentic...not the case), stocked full with fresh and good size crawfish, and so yummy, you want to use all your bread to wipe up the sauce.  \\nMy friend had the shrimp creole and it was delish as  well, filled with an abundance of big shrimps. \\nWhatever you do, don't leave without ordering at least one order of Beignets with the side sauces.

It's almost as if the customer has to provide a service for the employees in order to get ice cream. This is a recurring problem and I wish it wasn't, because the thought of having a great ice cream place in the neighborhood would be wonderful, especially during these summer months. Let me explain my experiences.\\n\\nThe first time we went it was late evening on a week night (read not busy but still plenty of time before closing, and we are the only customers) and the girl behind the counter was impatient. She asked if we were ready to order right as we walked in the door. She wanted our order now because she was busy and had to run an errand for her boss. I'm pretty sure her errand is to make sales on ice cream, but who am I to judge?Regardless, we weren't ready because it was our first visit, so she left to the back of the building, we waited for a while, but we finally left out the front door when it seemed like she wasn't coming back. It just so happened we were meeting friends there and they decided to try their luck and walked in, but they were met with the same story and the employee left to the back once again. There goes four sales to Jeni's in Krog street market. Jeni's is really good, by the way.\\n\\nA few weeks later we wanted to give Jake's the benefit of the doubt and try again, this time earlier in the day. Instead of getting an impatient and fleety staff like last time, we were met with an empty store. Ten minutes we waited.... We called to the back, no answer. Eventually a dishwasher answered our SOS distress calls and was surprised that their wasn't a cashier manning the front of the house. Confused, the dishwasher told us the employee will be back shortly and they returned to dishes. No more waiting for us. Bye, thanks for nothing. \\n\\nAnd finally last night was the straw that broke the back of this devoted but discouraged ice cream eater. Months have gone by since these earlier encounters, and we were walking by at about 10pm. We were surprised to see that there were actual employees actually serving people ice cream (novel I know) so we decided, why not? It's not the ice cream's fault Jake's is birdbrained when it comes to taking money from customers. We walk in at 10:00 with about six people in front of us. Great! It's finally going to work. We're going to beat them at their own game and finally get that sweet, cold cream. I learned from my first visit that in order to maintain an employee behind the counter you should make a decision quickly. No tastes for me! I know what I'm getting! A couple minutes pass when the bird behind the counter notices us in line. He chirps loudly and proudly and pronounces they're closed. OK. Confused as to why the lights are on and people are in line buying ice cream, I tell the employee that it appears as though they're open. He points at the neon sign facing the street that is no longer lit and says that the open sign is off. Impressed with the incredible display of customer service negligence, I bow in defeat, thank him for his time and leave. \\n\\nLook I know how it gets when it's closing time. But handle it better. Close the door, display better signage, communicate when we walk in that you are closed. Don't let us wait and waste our time.\\n\\nI hope the owner reads this and discovers the bad eggs running their business. I can't imagine this streak is sustainable, especially when we will tell everyone to go to Jeni's. I'm sure their ice cream is better anyways. \\n\\nI'm not one to complain. Check my post history.

It was on a Saturday so there were a good amount of people there to watch college football games. This is a Nebraska Cornhuskers bar, so if you are into that this would be the spot for you. It also looks like it was a Cleveland Browns bar on Sundays. If you are into sports bars this is a pretty decent set up for you. There were TVs everywhere with pretty good views through out the bar. One cool thing that they have is if your game isn't playing over the PA system, they have portable speakers that will allow you to hear your game or switch between games. That was a very cool feature that I hadn't seen before. Maybe its at other places but this was the 1st I'd seen it. \\nAs for the food, there is typical bar fare here with a Chicago twist. They have Itialian beef sandwiches and Chicago dogs and a few other themed foods, but for the most part its the same type of food you would expect from a sports bar. I wasn't sure what to get and the waitress was new and handn't really tried much of the food so she couldn't give me too many tips. My buddy got tacos but the meat was chicken fingers. He said he gets them all the time and really likes them. I went with the \\"Irish Nachos\\" which were kettle cooked potato chips and basically all the nachos fixings. I upgraded and went with the homemade guac which was decent but nothing to write home about. The nachos them selves were not anything special either. The ground beef was a bit bland and the queso was not so great. The serving size was pretty large and under any other circumstance I would have ended up sharing them but I hadn't eaten lunch so I ate the whole thing. Over all it was a bit too salty, but that's kind of what you get with that type of order. The other members of my party got wings, loaded potato skins and fried pickles. Eveyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, but the wings looked pretty small compared to what I am used to.\\nThere was a good selection of draft beer and a full bar of course.

Considering it was a mid-week early evening, business was well here.  The bar also look packed.  \\nWe had the Peking Duck with steamed buns as appetizer.  Anyone who has had this dish at a Chinese restaurant knows that the roasted duck meat is cut and sliced thin, so that you can make it into a sandwich with the buns.  However, they served it by 1 piece of duck leg, not sliced, and with 5 buns.  You will have to cut it up yourself and because it is meant to be a shared dish, it got messy.  The taste is nowhere close to Peking style and did not go well with the over salty kimchi.  The presentation is just so wrong.  Such a disappointment.  \\nFor entrees, we had the Chic Marsala and Crab Cakes with a side order of garden salad.  The Marsala tasted well, flavorful, huge portion, served with mashed potato and well presented.  The Crab Cakes came in 4 little ones but the quality was good, lots of crab meats and no breadcrumbs.  Salad was a little on the disappointing side, served on a small flat plate, so the veggies easily got all over the table when forking it.

You get all the shellfish in one dish.  \\n\\nNothing wrong with this dinner meal... LARGE portions for the price I must say.... And we didn't stop there.... I was only able to eat a scoop of vanilla ice cream.... my sister and her boyfriend ordered the ice cream cookie, which when it comes out is shaped as the cookie monster himself.

While we found the fish good, it didn't seem to be as fresh as we would have liked.  The restaurant was quite empty when we went and the question arose as to how a slow restaurant can keep fish fresh.  We also ordered two rolls which were ok.  The East Meets West roll was overpriced at $19 for 5 small pieces, and as another reviewer mentioned, the roll was too acidic.  The Hamachi Peak roll was tasty, but not mind blowing.\\n\\nWe had originally planned on ordering more but were disappointed with the food up to this point that we decided just to call it a night instead of spending more.\\n\\nI'd give the food a 3/5 but given the high prices am dropping that to a 2/5.\\n\\nIn the end, this restaurant definitely didn't live up to the hype.

There seem to be many mixed reviews for this higher-end, French themed, newer addition to Market Street. It's reasonable to assume a new establishment may have some kinks to work out in the beginning. The amount of effort the management is willing to invest towards necessary improvements, however, is the key to success. \\n\\nA good friend of mine frequents Market Street on a regular basis. The first visit to Gaslight with her husband was disappointing after what she described as \\"unacceptable customer service by a hostess.\\" It was brought to the attention of management, who responded promptly and went above and beyond to welcome my friend and her husband back for another chance. \\n\\nLuckily for me, my friend invited me along on her return trip. First impressions, the decor reminds me of an upscale French cafe, full of rich, classic details, yet with a modern feel. There is a large bar on the left, a large dining room with booth and table seating, and an outdoor patio area. It was a gorgeous night weatherwise, so we had the hostess lead us to an outdoor table. Our hostess was very friendly and engaged us in conversation before leaving us to study the menu. \\n\\nOur waitress was just as friendly and very attentive throughout the entire meal. We began with a carafe of wine. A small loaf of French bread is delivered to the table in a little paper bag - cute touch. The menu has a generous selection of gourmet dishes with a French influence offering a variety of steak, chicken, and seafood dishes. I'm a pretty traditional eater and therefore had some difficulty deciphering the menu. The salmon seemed like a safe bet. It was delicious and cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crisp on the top. The salmon was served on a bed of fingerling potatoes and greens covered in a lemon sauce that was delish. Paired with my glass of wine and the beautiful evening air on the patio, I was in food heaven. My friend had the roast chicken which she raved about as well. They also have a very generous selection of wines.  \\n\\nOur server listened to my friend's story about her initial unsatisfactory experience at Gaslight. We told her how pleased we were with the service this time around. As a result of this conversation, one of the owners came over to introduce himself as he remembered my friend and the incident which had occurred. He went that extra mile stopping by our table, which shows true dedication to his business and customers - I was impressed. Last night the service, food, and atmosphere here were most definitely spot on.\\n\\nGaslight is a bit on the pricier side, so I may need to save this one for special occasions.

Which we were very lucky to get because it was very busy due to a wedding reception(it seemed?) in a portion of the restaurant.\\n\\nOur waiter was very friendly and knew the entire menu by heart and could explain anything we asked him, which was very helpful since this was a new restaurant to us. The steaks we got to enjoy and soups were very tasty. I wish I could have had more of my lobster bisque soup but I had to save room for my steak and dessert! With the meal plan, this is all included and one alcoholic beverage, so that was pretty cool.\\n\\nFrom start to finish it was great!

The prices have gone up, I remember when Spanakopita plate was only $9.95, now $13.95. What has changed the most is the service. Sometimes exceptionally slow even when not busy. But what sealed their fate is the attitude of the staff, especially the woman who has been there as long as I have gone there. I saw other Yelp reviews about the disrespect by the staff, likely this woman and considered not bringing my friends there. Not only did she (not my waitress) decide to come over to my table to berate me for questions on the cost of a side as not what I remembered, she was talking about me behind the counter loudly enough for the whole place to hear.

Not too busy, great upscale decor with tons of natural light from the floor to ceiling windows.\\n\\nWe decided to eat at the bar so we could watch the basketball games on tv there since it's march madness. There's one TV at the far end of the bar, but it's big enough that even if you weren't sitting at the end you could watch.\\n\\nIn true brunch fashion we started with Bloody Marys. Their mix isn't the typical mix (they make it there and it doesn't have the standard v8 taste) but we loved them. They were a bit spicy (we would've liked them a bit hotter) but they really were great.\\n\\nTo start for food, we got a dozen oysters. They had 6 different kinds on the menu- mostly local- so we ordered two of each. The oysters were pretty pricey at $3-$3.25 each but they were all some of the best oysters we've had in the city (and we eat oysters everywhere). Even though our food came right after we finished the dozen, we ordered another round. The hot sauce that comes with the oysters is house made and has this amazing smoky flavor. The oysters alone were delicious but we couldn't help adding hot sauce to a few because it was just that good.\\n\\nFor entrees we had the buccatini with bacon and the steak and eggs. \\n\\nThe potatoes that come with the steak and eggs were perfectly crispy and had this chili powder and a horseradish aioli drizzled on them that both gave a nice flavor. There was also a green sauce on the plate next to the steak that was amazing with a bite of steak and a bite of the potatoes- I couldn't stop eating it. It was almost like a fresh pesto in consistency and had hints of cilantro and parsley.\\n\\nThe pasta in the buccatini entree is made fresh every morning. Other reviewers noted a small portion but between the egg, the bacon, the pasta, the cream sauce and the veggies, it was a very rich dish and I don't know that anyone could  comfortably eat more than the portion that was served. It was delicious and even though it was rich, it was all so fresh that it wasn't too heavy.\\n\\nWe usually don't get dessert when we eat out, but because so many reviewers noted the chocolate om ali we had to try it. It was super rich, but perfect for sharing. I couldn't stop eating it. It was chocolate lava cake with coconut and ice cream and it was unbelievable.

This is a nice seafood choice in the Disney Springs open air shopping center.    The motif is the whole place is done up as a giant paddleboat (this being Disney, it only \\"looked\\" like a boat though).\\n\\nAt the first there was a bit of trouble with the front desk and management.  We were inexplicably seated nearly alone in a back room away from water views, but quickly the room filled with another group, including 5-6 badly behaved kids and 4 oblivious adults. The adults seemed to think it was cute the kids were running around knocking over chairs, etc.   After a complete lack of intervention by management with the out-of-control kids, the kids literally started breaking glasses.  They seemed old enough to know better, but were more the Lindsay Lohan type of Disney kid than a Jodie Foster.\\n\\nCould be tourist fatigue led the staff to not even noticing the wildly annoying kids even when they were screaming and smashing things.  There were very odd reactions all around especially when directly asked to remedy it.    We had to strenuously suggest a move and then got the quiet beautiful view (by getting up, walking in there and sliding 2 tables together ourselves LOL).    Oddly enough that part was deserted and the place was 1/3 full.  \\n\\nFood and service were both top notch, which made the screaming glass shattering kids even stranger.    This place could easily be five stars with better front desk staff to take care of problems, and maybe 3/4 the prices.\\n\\nThe best choice was called The Trio, which included large shrimp, ceviche and tuna succotash.   Shrimp and tuna were cooked to perfection, and the ceviche was some of the best l have had.    Even the cocktail sauce tasted handmade.   It could be that the manager said \\"be nice to them after the brat trauma\\" but the man who waited on us was so polite and on-the-spot it was amazing.\\n\\nThere are fun Disney touches like a huge artificial lake with the faux paddlewheel on it, people peddling by in floating cars, and an enormous hot air ballon taking off at close range.   Disney really does the  \\"show\\" part well every time, but this was great food too, aside from the glass-shattering kids and inattentive front desk."},{"name":"Il Mulino New York Lounge","address":"1200 Epcot Resorts Blvd","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"So this was our 2nd stop as we crawled the Dolphin / Swan resort area.

They chop up the lamb and lay it over the rice with a some shreds of lettuce and diced tomato.

My main (only) squeeze and I decided to go here for Downtown Atlanta Restaurant Week. We chose this place because we've been to most of the restaurants featured on DT ATL restaurant week and Fire of Brazil is usually around $50 pp. Fire of Brazil is also a Brazilian bbq or churrascaria chain we haven't been to yet. Their restaurant week deal included unlimited salad bar and bbq and a drink. What a let down this place was. It made me wonder why the heck would anyone pay $50 to go here instead of Fogo de Chao? The place is the anti-thesis of fine dining and looks more like a cafeteria. Not to mention you have to pay for parking in dt Atl. Granted, Fire of Brazil validated our parking, so it only cost us $5 to park. However, the full price to park at the deck where Fire of Brazil is located is $20. No. \\n\\nThe service here was friendly but extremely slow. Our server forgot to bring us all of the side dishes included in the meal. We were able to try the yuca chips, beans, and plaintains. They were ok, but I prefer thicker cuts of yucca. The salad bar was disappointing. It was more cafeteria-esque; no quality meats, lots of canned items ( corn, beets, olives, surimi, etc). I can't believe the salad bar buffet is $22. However, the meats were actually good, so the restaurant redeemed itself there. However, there was a hair on my bf's plate. We addressed the issue with our server and he promptly informed the manager who showed up quite some time afterwards. He thanked us for informing him of the matter. When the bill arrived, he charged us for one meal and a salad bar, which saved us about $15 in addition to the restaurant week deal. Also, there was a shrimp shell stuck underneath our tablecloth. It seemed like maybe it was still stuck on the tablecloth after it was cleaned because I saw them lay the tablecloth on the table before we sat down. It's just an example of poor quality control. \\n\\nFire of Brazil in downtown Atlanta most likely gets its business from tourists because I cannot imagine many locals going here when there are so many other good options in town."},{"name":"Paddlefish Restaurant","address":"1670 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Good very overpriced for the quality.

They don't give a crap about guest comfort or experience. All they care about is cramming as many diners into their space as possible so they can squeeze as many pennies as possible out of guests.\\n\\nAnd squeezing pennies out of guests is something the owners of Tasty n Alder have turned into a blatantly hollow art form- ridiculously overcharge guests for small dishes that are made 100% with the intent of maximizing kitchen cost efficiency over guest experience and serve them whenever we want to the guests that we cram practically shoulder to shoulder into our dining room at the expense of basic comfort.\\n\\nIf you're not turned off by the idea of paying maybe 50% more to double what an entree might be worth to watch your friends and family eat while you wait for the kitchen to send out your entree at their leisure, all while being crammed into the dining room like sardines, the food is actually pretty good.\\n\\nIf you care about the overall experience of dining out in a comfortable atmosphere and actually eating with your family, give Tasty n Alder a metaphorical middle finger and take your money elsewhere."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"So the three stars is based on two dim sum experiences here.

The sprinkles and bacon one are famous but we don't eat meat so we didn't try it. \\n\\nPersonally I like sublime donuts more and will be using my calories there. \\n\\nRevolution donuts is a welcoming cool shop with plenty of parking and people go crazy for this place.

This might be a long review\\n\\nWe tried making reservations but they don't do reservations for parties less than 7 I believe. So it was a Monday night, we are super hungry from all our exploring activities. The reviews brought us here. \\nThe guys were parking and I ran in to get a table for 4. The waitress told me it was going to be a 45 minute wait. I give her my number. She totally wrote my number wrong. I was a bit worried, and had to get a closer look at the book to tell her she wrote it wrong. I was not gonna wait around and not get a text or call. \\n\\nFYI - if you're going write down phone number, give them a text or ring right there to ensure you have the right number. \\n\\nThe guys already paid for parking, so we decided to wait. Okay, the restaurant is super tiny. The ambiance is really nice with the modern day touch. The bar area was really tiny, but at least they allowed us to stand around. The lady was supposed to call us in 45 minutes, but as we expected, it passed 45 minutes and we were still waiting. My boyfriend went to asked at about 40 minutes to see where we were on the waitlist and she said we were next. She offered us a tiny table by the bar that had three chairs, she said they can make it fit 4, but we declined that. It's horrible to eat while everyone is standing around you waiting for a table. \\nWe had orders drinks while we waited. I made a joke to my boyfriend saying how silly would it be if we give up and just leave and forget to pay for our drinks since it's been a hour. As soon as I made the joke. A waiter brings out a small complementary cheese & fruit board for us. So kind of him. That definitely took away my frustration for waiting longer than expected. \\nWe finally got seated. \\nMy boyfriend wanted to order the Head to Tail salmon but they ran out. That was interesting. So he went with the Grilled Octopus and an side of the Grilled Broccolini. I ordered the Apple Brined Pork Chop that comes on top of pancakes.\\nAs we're waiting for our food, they came with a Grilled Octopus and the waiter (not the waitress that been serving us) goes \\"Here's an complementary grilled octopus.\\" So everyone thought they wanted us to try that. So we all enjoyed that. \\nEveryone got their dishes except my boyfriend. Everyone started eating. They told my friend they were waiting on her ducks. \\nWhen my boyfriend asked the waitress about the Grilled Octopus, she said it should had been one of the first item to come out earlier on. Oh, that explained the \\"complementary grilled octopus.\\" Well that's a bummer. On the bright side, the waitress explained that they meant to give my boyfriend the octopus for free since he didn't get the Head to Tail salmon he originally wanted. How sweet of them. I give them that! It's just terrible communication as we all thought that octopus they brought was for us all. But it was fine, he ate off my dish and I had a huge dish. The pork chop was huge and fulfilling. \\nOverall, my experience was interesting. I love the different attempts they tried to make the situation better for us. So I give them a four star. \\n\\nIf I live in Portland, I can see myself coming back here some day to try their other dishes. Originally, I wanted to try the Korean Fried Chicken, but that wasn't on the menu for dinner.

The wait time was about an hour at 4 pm and we ended up getting two seats by the bar which I actually preferred. \\n\\nThis spot most certainly deserves a 5/5.  I am not a seafood expert, but the oysters were simply outstanding.  Divine freshness.  You can order different types depending on what type of finish taste you prefer, but I tried the fruity and citrusy finish ones and they were incredible.  \\n\\nWe also got two appetizers: the hamachi crudo and the tuna tartare with the avocado spread.  The prices are a bit high for appetizers ($16) but you are paying for the freshness and quality of the fish.  The little chips on top of the hamachi were a nice touch, and the avocado was the perfect companion to that fresh tuna on a crostini.  I highly recommend trying them.\\n\\nNow, the lobster roll IS all the rave ($25).  There is a reason this place has a 4.5 average even after 1000 reviews and more.   If you come to Neptune Oyster even once in your life,  this is the one dish that one must get.  We got the hot roll with butter, and it was one of the best things I have ever eaten period.  The lobster just melted in your mouth, and the touch of sweetness from the brioche bun just took it to a whole other level.  The french fries were also excellent.

The street corn was excellent, the ribs on coke however, not so much. The crawfish were a major letdown. Instead of cooking them the traditional way (seasoning boiling water and cooking the crawfish, corn, and potatoes all together in a large pot), they seemed to boil everything separately with no seasoning. At the end, everything was added together in a bowl and coated with a sauce. The crawfish didn't have much flavor, and the corn and potatoes were okay.

Even with the leapold it's a great mix of pork and basil with each bite that was great. The salad and pasta deal is really the way to go with 4 options of salad and a half pasta. Pasta good enough size to tide you over and salads range from house to veggies to caprese, all with a Patrizi twist but all with drags ingredients. Caprese was the best in my opinion but salad was colorful and fine as well. \\n\\nDownside comes from the wait. 49 minutes for a pasta is ridiculous at 8pm. Line wasn't too long and they had 3 people outside talking to the customers awkwardly that was presumably supposed to show customer service but to me it was weird and creepy.

(Now I know why that magazine is FREE, lol.)  I was hoping to find a place for decent Mexican food that would spare me the 30 minute drive to Waltham's Taqueria Amigos.  Unfortunately, this is simply not it...I'm guessing it's Salvadorean or Honduran, since there's a whole section of the menu dedicated to pupusas.  Then again they also have PIZZA on the menu...go figure!  \\n\\nWe had the carne asada plate and the chuletas (pork chop) plate.  The meat was lean, dry and bland, along with the rest of the plate: the rice and baked beans (no refried beans here).  Instead of steamed tortillas, our food came with small portions of cucumber-tomato salad, as well as potato salad...wth???    \\n\\nLater on, it dawned on me that this is NOT a \\"Mexican\\" place at all---which explained why the guacamole ($5 with chips) was listed on the menu as MEXICAN guacamole.  It happened to be the best thing we had however, which leads me to the charitable conclusion that there might be better things on the menu that we should try next time.  And since I'm not familiar with Salvadorean or Honduran food, who knows, perhaps by those cuisines' standards this place is spectacular...but right now it looks like I'll continue to make that long drive over to Waltham!  \\n\\nTo be fair, this place has good service, and the food comes in generous portion sizes and is clearly fresh-made, not that Sysco crap you get at the chain restaurants.  It is also a nicer physical setting than the cramped, trailer-like quarters of the Waltham joint.  However, I just couldn't shake the feeling I was eating at Whole Foods, due to the dismal lack of salt and fat in the food...in other words, gringo-fied tourist food.  I suspect that the 5 star reviews are from people with that bland Whole Foods palate...am gobsmacked that someone claiming to be from Texas was raving about this place.

Unfortunately, Neptune Oysters had a much thinner soup.

It was way too salty for my taste & even I enjoy a little extra salt in my food.\\n\\nLobster Roll:\\nI was SOOO excited for the Lobster Roll because I mean, I waited 2 hours just to have it. The hype was so real & when it came down to actually eating it, my experience ended in such an anticlimactic way. The bread was simple, the lobster didn't fall apart in my mouth & the butter was just....butter. I really wanted to like it, but it's sad to say I enjoyed the fries more than the lobster roll.\\n\\nMy entire experience was like watching a gripping trailer for a movie that you end up dying to go see, but only to be disappointed & upset that you actually spent $15 on a movie ticket & over-priced popcorn for some C grade movie. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I don't think I can give this place another chance, especially if the wait is 2 hours.

Still too crispy I ate in anyway. I don't like to waste. My daughter ordered a side of black beans which use to be special with added carrots and peppers. Now I think they just pour straight from the can to the bowl. My other friends that came with were upset over the bill mix up and overall we all left feeling a little disappointed in what we always felt like it was a great place. \\n\\nI do have to say that the best waiter you have if he is still there, tall, late 30's, brown hair, light beard, glasses, flamboyant. I love him. He is my favorite waiter. He is always friendly and has a great personality.

After moving from attempted eye contact to desperate hand waving, someone notices and takes our drink orders. Our waiter tries to take our order but appears to be confused by words (an ominously bad sign); we were also told that it is \\"tapas\\" style, which is essentially an excuse for this place to not spend a modicum of thought on how to pace a meal. We receive our food one order at a time, presumptively whenever the kitchen bothered to make something, and the food was doused in garlic without any real flavor. \\n\\nOne of our souffle pancakes came out, but 2 hours after we first came in, there was no sign of our second order. We go up to a lady who looks like the manager, and she tells us, \\"they take 15 minutes to make\\"- well, if that's the case we should have gotten 8 orders by now. We tell her it's been 2 hours and she tells us \\"the system is down\\". Perhaps she IS the system, and she was feeling down, but there was not even an apology for the wait. Finally, my poor friend gives up and tells her to just cancel the order. She doesn't say a thing. The waiter then immediately gives us our check- the fastest thing he did for us all morning (within minutes of us canceling our order, without us asking for it)- and we paid the whole bill. The waiter literally stands there waiting as we pay- where was this attention to detail when we were waiting for our food??\\n\\nThis place has zero respect for customers.

Ummmmmmmmm, ok???\\n\\nSo, I make the drive to Halal Bros in freezing, rainy weather to pick up dinner for my wife and I. I show up, tell the cashier I am there to pick up my to-go order, she assures me that I am receiving the correct order by saying \\"the one with hot sauce on the side is on the bottom\\", I pay for my food, and run to my car to drive back home in the freezing cold.\\n\\nWhen I get home and pull out the food, my wife and I realize we have been given two chicken over rice plates, both with plenty of hot sauce on them. An honest mistake, we thought. So, we call Halal Bros and the same female cashier picks up the phone. We explain to her what has happened - to which she responds: \\"no one here remembers making chicken over rice plates.\\" So, she asks what I expect or want. I ask her what is normal in a situation such as this. She does not provide a direct response. So, I ask if she would be ok with issuing a credit to us, or if that is not feasible issuing us a refund. She hangs up on me. Odd, but not all that surprising at this point.\\n\\nI call back and she picks up again. She passes the phone to her manager, who tells us he cannot do anything unless we drive back to Halal Bros. I explain to him that we have a six month old at home, and driving back to west campus is not an option for us. I tell him that we took pictures of the food given to us, but he doesn't care. He says there is nothing he can do.\\n\\nI am at a loss for words as to how a business such as this can employ such horrific customer service. I called and placed a simple to-go order, their employee told me that the food I was picking up was what I had ordered, and that ended up not being the case. Then, instead of showing a bit of goodwill they tell me that I must get back in my car, drive 20 minutes to their establishment, show them the error in their ways, wait for my correct food to be made, and then drive 20 minutes back to my home while my starving wife and grumpy infant wait?

If you are visiting the area, this is a good opportunity to venture around the rest of the North End and see what else it has to offer.

I was able to try a few of them which I had no complaints about, it was a good appetizer for the main course, which in my case of course was the lobster roll!  You are able to get two different types of lobster rolls here.  First is the conventional lobster roll, which is cold and has mayo.  Their other lobster rolls is warm with butter.  I got the warm lobster roll with butter... and I have NO regrets!  \\n\\nFor my personal preference, I think I would prefer a warm lobster roll than a cold one if the quality of food was the same.  I loved the lobster pieces they put here and this lobster roll is definitely one of the best I have had in Boston!  Though the lobster roll is pricey, you do get a good amount of lobster and I was fully satisfied at the end of my meal.  The butter complemented the lobster pieces very well!

The onion rings are an option as a side to your sandwich. It's not listed on the menu, but it is available! I love how when I took 1 bite from the onion ring and it didn't fall apart. Woo! Nothing worse for an onion ring eater than a mouth full of onion while the breading gets left behind on your plate. Don't miss the breakfast sausage links! 2 links per side order, but so worth it.

The rest was a Larry David experience.  \\n\\nI came in for brunch a couple of weeks ago.  We had a party of 8.  While we were waiting for our table, I stood in the back of the bar next to friends that were noshing on a 'starter'.  They were seated at the bar.  One of the servers gave me a couple of 'stairs' as she tried to pass and eventually suggested that I was in her way.  I thought this was odd because I'm standing at the bar and typically customers have the right of way but I tried to accommodate by moving to the side of the bar away from her 'path'.  At this point, I was told by another woman, who ended up being the owner, that I was in the way of the servers accessing the drinks so I asked the owner where would be a more appropriate place to stand (the bar wasn't even crowded).  She suggested I sit in the one open seat next to my friends at the bar.  I said this wasn't going to work because we were a party of eight and there weren't eight open seats.  She had no response and walked away.  At this point, our table was ready.\\n\\nOn the walk to the table, my five year old daughter saw these colorful stripped straws at the bar and asked me if I could get her one.

I suggested that there was a better way to treat customers.\\n\\nNow, I'd done it.  The owner quickly came over to me and told me not to speak to the server this way.  I was animated yes but just floored that I'd been spoken to three times because of spacing and straw issues in less than five minutes tim.  While I tried to plead my case to the owner, she was less than interested in hearing my side and proceeded to hover over my table of 8 and telling me how I wasn't making her comfortable.

But in the vein of \\"you get what you pay for,\\" when it comes to brunch in Boston, \\"you get what you wait for.\\"  \\n\\nSo there is a reason this place is empty during prime brunch hours.  The food is weak and the service is so so terrible.  Chocolate pancakes are dry.  Date bread stale (though a good theoretical attempt at a creative bread).  And the egg \\"sandwich\\" is more like two eggs on a single stale slab of bread with green unseasoned paste (I know that \\"deconstruction\\" is in these days, but the stuff still needs to taste good).\\n\\nMost importantly, the service is terrible.  Waiters have a real surly attitude.  And they totally messed up our vegetarian request to \\"hold the bacon\\" despite having a several minute conversation about this (never encountered this much resistance to hold the bacon).\\n\\nMaybe all the surliness is by design.  The Liberty Hotel where the restaurant is housed is a converted prison so there are all these callbacks to its former life (e.g., instead of \\"do not disturb\\" signs, the doors say \\"SOLITARY\\").

The thinly shredded seaweed was crisp and the semi-salty preserved cucumber was a nice addition to the sweet salmon. \\n\\nAfter a good 10 minutes or next dish came.

If it had been cooked properly I wouldn't have minded. I would have been happy with much less meat and larger proportions of vegetables, a more garden-esque burger. That was another problem: I didn't have many vegetables in my garden burger, no more than the normal amount in a classic tomato-lettuce-onion-pickle burger (the tomatoes mushrooms, peppers, onions, and lettuce in my order were outnumbered tenfold by the oversized patty). Overall, the burger wasn't bad, but the presentation and service seemed lazy: potato chips most likely from a bag were thrown on the side of mine much like the fried potatoes on the side of my friend's burger (which were also soggy, blackened and sad looking, most likely from multiple dips into the fryer.) First and foremost, this place presents itself as a neighborhood bar. I could tell the locals knew each other and it looked like they were having a good time.

The cheese, mushrooms, and onions were all piled on top of the ham so they were all cold, it was kinda gross. The cheese wasn't even melted. It was like eating a burger with a cold ham sandwich on top. It seems like they are more about the gimmick of having a huge burger with tons of crap on it rather than making something that actually tastes good.

If you're from the East Coast,  West Coast, or big Southern city (pop. greater than 700k), this review is for you.\\n\\nI came to this place because it is consistently ranked one of the top burgers in the state of Ohio. I wanted to order the Thurman Burger but experience has taught me to always go for the basic burger, cheeseburger, or bacon cheeseburger when trying a new burger spot. if you can't get a basic burger right, your speciality burgers just aren't worth it. \\n\\nI love that Thurman has a separate takeout space for to-go orders. Plenty of space outside to sit on the benches while you wait 10-20 minutes for your burger to be made. I ordered the Western Burger: 3/4 lb burger, American cheese, bacon, and BBQ sauce. The best thing about this burger is that it's big. After that it was pretty downhill. The burgers are pretty basic...meh at best. There are lot of places these days that go for big Instagram worthy burgers. But if you're burgers lack taste what's the point? I just wasn't impressed. In other news, the service was really nice and the bathrooms were surprisingly clean.

I've had better from other places in town (including, to be honest, Five Guys), and the toppings and bun were nothing to write home about.  Fried pickles and onion rings were OK but, again, nothing life changing or unavailable elsewhere.  The portions seem to be the only notable aspect of this place.

There are paper menus to grab as you walk in, and drinks/daily specials up on the hanging boards above the counter. You'll place your order at the counter, grab utensils and such on your own and grab an open table to wait for your food to be brought out.\\n\\nWe went with the seasonal wood-fired vegetable special which was a perfect plate of cauliflower and greens, and a 12\\" Mikey Handsome pizza to share between two. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection, with their housemade dukkah seasoning adding all the right flavors. The pizza was fantastic, with thin crust bubbled and wood-fire charred just the right amount, a great balance of sauce/toppings, and cut the right number of times for its size. Doubling as a bakery, the flour/ingredients are clearly of high quality, and at $16 - a relative bargain.\\n\\nThis place has my recommendation, so I hope you'll give it a try! The other pizzas, salads, and sides look and sound excellent, and there are a number of fresh baked goods available behind the counter as well- carrying over from the bakery hours in the morning.

While they were kind and able to accommodate a substitute sandwich for me, it ended up still having stuff in it I was allergic to.

We both shared an entree of a grilled pork chop in a wine and watermelon reduction. Sweet, savory, a delight. The dessert of chocolate pot du creme and creme brulee was a perfect end to our meal. I was a tad miffed that the hostess didn't ask if I wanted coffee or espresso, nor any beverage to accompany our dessert. I could have asked, but I'm accustomed to the waiter at least asking.

We used to love coming here when it was Fulton's. We wanted to surprise my father for his birthday and we took the whole family here.  We ordered appetizers. The server had two other tables which was too much for her. We got the appetizers and they were not even warm. Even the entrees were like warm and nothing was fresh. The toast points on the clams were made days ago, the seafood i would put on par with Red Lobster. My sons poached eggs were cooked hard. Nothing was very good. The worst part is after waiting 20 minutes to get our checks she was still in the weeds. So I spoke with the manager about our experience and asked him to please have someone cash us out. He never asked about the issues or even apologized. He did nothing to make our experience a good one or make it better at least. I expect more from any restaurant. The managers never tough tables here even as we were here for so long. Very disappointing.

I put my name and phone number here a few times and lost my appetite after interacting with this thing. \\n\\nWho does that? Is she the owner or the owner's wife? Either way, such attitude does not justify--treating potential customers like garbage or beggars. She and her list is quite infamous. In one instance, the List Woman left her list and those waiting just started putting their names and phone numbers, where she would later come back and cross them all out bc it's not how her list works. \\n\\nThere is no clear sign or rules or anything obvious to the customers (regulars or tourists for that matter) so what List Woman considers the rule, is clearly not stated or written anywhere for customers to decipher. \\n\\nIn other instances, some customers (whom List Woman may deemed \\"beggars\\") waited in line to find out that they were supposed to be putting their names/numbers on her list. Should they wait to the left or to the right of the store? It's still unknown. (I still don't know, it's random each time.) Don't bother going in to ask the List Woman, she will get pissed off at you or ignore you until she feels like talking to you, unless she tells you to shut the door prior to that. There's one instance where she got annoyed at these poor beggars and just locked the door, for those beggars to wait outside.\\n\\nBeside the above, food is good. See my posted pictures, I've written enough about the problem above, that there is no room for the good food or the great service by other deserving servers. For future, may not leave any tips. Would feel bad for the servers, but the infamous List Woman should be handled somehow, or can we tip and explicitly state to be shared accordingly so long as the List Woman is excluded from my tip? No customers should tip anyone who treats them like beggars. Let's see how this will play out. We'll post updates. One who pays $150-$250 (including tip) for a meal for three clearly deserved more than being deemed a beggar.\\n\\nAdvice: get rid of the List Woman, upgrade to Yelp Reservations or phone reservations or any other means, or minimally, make it known how the line works--customers may be deemed as beggars since the business is doing so well--whether by hype or by food quality or whatever--but bad publicity do spread and can shut down a business such as this in a snap. Also, note, of course there are those (eg Giacomo's) that don't use such updated reservation methods; but there, you don't have to deal with the infamous List Woman unlike here, which is the major topic of this review."},{"name":"Sabor Tapatio","address":"5604 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"This is the best taco place in Austin and I've eaten a  lot of tacos.

Once down on the floor it's like you've walked into a restaurant in the middle of Rome. The ambiance, staff and menu are all Italian. They have the English meanings under the Italian name. This is a fancy upscale restaurant so you are given your wine, then appetizer, and then your main meal. For a wine, I chose a white wine and had their steamed calamari pesto dish as an appetizer. It was difficult to choose my main course. I ended up getting the lobster white wine pasta dish. When I tell you it was delicious, I savored every moment and still had leftovers.

The chicken was delicious -- extremely well cooked, no pieces of fat, or excess breading -- just perfect. I went with sticky brown rice and fries for my sides and both complemented the chicken so well! Their spicy chicken is good, but definitely not too hot -- still has some good kick.\\n\\nThe modern build-outs of the seating area and the patio is amazing, and really adds to the atmosphere of the restaurant. I'm really eager to bring my friends back!\\n\\nAnother amazing thing I HAVE to mention is how exceptionally friendly, attentive, and on-top-of-it the staff was when I dined in. The cashier who took my order was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu, although I hadn't asked much since I stalked the menu for so long, and whenever I needed something like a box or was worried they wouldn't be able to find me when I sat down, they were super friendly, assured and assisted me as I needed. \\n\\nI seriously cannot wait to go back! :)"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Food is the best, service is great, but come on Pine State, $5 extra for vegan sausage!!???

The host looked quite embarrassed and cleaned one of the tables in front of us. After we sat down we ordered drinks while still sitting next to two dirty tables. I then came to realize that the reason that the wait time was so long was because there was nobody cleaning tables. me and my girlfriend got our drinks and our appetizer and finished our entrées all before these two tables next to us were cleaned.

I'll start with the good first... When you first walked in, you see a beautiful giant boat on the water which is very unusual. Upon entering, the smell is very overwhelming like seafood which you would expect in a seafood restaurant. We asked for a nice view so they brought us all the way upstairs to the third level through an elevator and out the windows you could see very beautiful views of the entire Disney springs area. The dishes that impressed us were the shrimp and grits, which is kind of spicy so be careful... And the tableside guacamole. The reason the guacamole is a talking point is because it was absolutely delicious like mouthwatering... But, it was $35 because they threw like a tablespoon of lobster on top. Not cool! For $35 we should be getting at least a cup of lobster. My husband really enjoyed his margaritas so if you want to drink, go ahead and order one of those. My son really enjoyed his cheeseburger but it didn't come with regular fries, it came with tasteless sweet potato chips. I think that's kind of weird to be paired with a cheeseburger if you ask me. My daughter and aunt both ordered the spaghetti with shrimp which they enjoyed but again, for the amount of money you pay, you expect something extravagant but it really was just plain spaghetti with shrimp. If you want to ball out and spend $300 for five people on a meal, definitely check this place out! Oh and one really strange thing was when they dropped off the brownie  that we said was for a birthday for my daughter they didn't even sing or anything they just dumped it off and walked away... I didn't like that. Also the service was kind of slow and they would leave dirty dishes on the table for a very long time until we had to ask for them to clear it away.

My husband and I celebrated our engagement here last year (as well as several previous dinners) and then decided to host our wedding celebration dinner here with 28 guests this past summer. Kate was a joy to work with, helping us tailor a menu that allowed guests to choose their multi-course meal at the event instead of months before. Chef Bond kindly accommodated (at the wedding itself and during all of our previous visits) both my dietary restrictions being a pescatarian and having an allergy and had the ability to tailor at the event in case any guests had an unknown restriction.  The food was local, creative and delicious  as always and they had beautiful and yummy passed hors d'oeuvres including crab cakes, melon, beef tartare and cheese with a bit of jam. Kate coordinated a wine tasting for us to select for a pairing with the meal including dessert wines and we had a few pre-selected cocktails, however they also had some beer and mixed cocktails on hand in case a guest wanted something specific. Our guests raved about the food and wine both at the event and when we have seen them since! They were very flexible about our vendors - we had a photographer, brought in some small floral arrangements and place cards, and little boxes of macarons to distribute as gifts, which the serving team subtly delivered to guests at the end of the meal. To be honest, Bondir needs none of these things - their decor is a balance of cozy, intimate and sophisticated and we did not need the extra macarons given how delicious the desserts were. The service both during our planning and throughout the wedding dinner was phenomenal. Kate was wonderful to work with - accessible, flexible and coordinated the team perfectly on the day of the event. Our serving staff during the dinner included Kate, Erin and Eric, who were gracious and professional, providing personal and subtle service that provided the perfect amount of support and presence without distracting in any way from the conversation. Service is something that is often overlooked at weddings and can be difficult to coordinate across vendors who do not work together daily. The team at Bondir clearly loves what they do and works together seamlessly and because of that were able to deliver such a precise and personal evening. We recently came back to celebrate a year since our engagement and were greeted by the warmest welcome from Chef Bond, Kate and Erin. Thank you to Bondir for making our wedding so enjoyable and memorable.

First, by bringing our drinks to us and literally slamming them on the table, causing one of the glasses of wine to slosh out of its glass.

Nope. That took another 15 minutes. I'd like to note that our waitress was very friendly with every other table but when she came over to us it seemed to be like this massive chore. She didn't even bring over plates, utensils, or the wet naps like usual. The wrong wings kept being brought over to our table and being left there.

I'm much pickier about breakfast/brunch food than lunch/dinner so it made me happy to find a good place. They can make some improvements but overall, solid restaurant. We got the southern beignets, avocado toast, and cultivate benedict. I also got the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Here are my thoughts:\\n\\nSouthern beignets: I like how it tastes light even though it's deep-fried. It's not dense nor is it oily. The taste of the beignets itself is not the best, but still good. It tastes better with the berry jam/sauce they give on the side.\\n\\nAvocado toast: I've never had avocado toast that tasted like this before. It's acidic, sour, and sweet at the same time. It was pretty good but I don't think I'd get it again. Not a huge fan of the pickled toppings. I really liked the baguette it was on--thin and crispy. I really didn't like the side of kale. I'm usually okay with kale but this was way too bitter.\\n\\nCultivate benedict: That biscuit is bomb. It melts in your mouth and I like how it's not salty. The egg and hash brown was cooked perfectly. I didn't like how incredibly sweet the bacon was. If they can tone it down on the sweetness, I think this dish would be great.\\n\\nGrapefruit juice: Nothing special. Didn't taste fresh.\\n\\nAgain, the food isn't perfect and they can work on some of the flavors, but this place has a lot of potential!"},{"name":"Clyde's Prime Rib Restaurant & Bar","address":"5474 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh my god I love this place.

What remains more of a NoPo secret is that they actually have THE BEST ice cream in Portland. Forget Salt & Straw, Ruby Jewel, etc., Lovely's is making more interesting flavors, and is all organic to boot. They also have the perfect ice to creaminess ratio. Most of the options rotate so there's always something new and hyper-seasonal. Most recently I tried the rhubarb buttermilk, which went down as the best ice cream I've ever had, period.\\n\\nIn the same fashion, the pizzas are fantastic too. Hyper-seasonal, extremely original, and all organic. You definitely pay a premium for all that, with most 12\\" pies in the $23-25 range. The good news is that they seem large for a 12\\", but the bad part is that they leave about 2 inches of crust around the outside, making me feel a tad screwed on the good toppings in the middle. It would be great if they also offered an 8\\" or 10\\" individual size. Call me traditional, but I prefer their red sauced pizzas to the others.  \\n\\nService is friendly and efficient, while the interior is cozy. Though be warned, it can feel like a bit of a daycare earlier in the evening, with kids and babies often screaming throughout.

The wait service was outstanding and the food five star quality and taste. We shared an order of calamari and it was crispy outside and barely chewy inside with a fresh taste. The marinara that came with the calamari was thick and full of flavor.  I could have eaten a bowl of it as a soup-chowder!  The house salads we chose were a chopped garden salad with dressing. Great taste and combination of ingredients. I had a rib eye that was cooked perfectly. If you usually order medium rare, you may want to order medium here.  A loaded baked potato came with it and that was delicious, including the crunchy potato skin which I love. My wife had a chicken breast that came smothered in NY style corned beef and Swiss cheese. She also had a side of the thick creamed spinach which melted in our mouths. Fantastic combination. The atmosphere at Joey D's is reminiscent of a 1950's upscale steak house with a visually inspiring bar and Sinatra music playing.

Fortunately for us the wait has never been a big issue and the longest we've had to wait has been 20-30 minutes. \\n\\nThe only time we really visit J. Alexander's is when I'm craving a prime rib which is really rare nowadays, but the cravings do invade every now and then. Although it's a chain, I can definitely say they dish out a really delicious and tender prime rib with well seasoned smashed potatoes. I've tried a few other dishes, but the prime rib and creme brulee keep me coming back. Their creme brulee is HUGE and definitely sharable. It's so creamy and not overly sweet, and I could eat the entire serving you myself to be completely honest. \\n\\nThey do provide complimentary bread to start off with, but they usually won't offer it upfront, so you'll have to ask for the bread yourself. \\n\\nThe ambience is very intimate and/or romantic, so this would be a nicer upscale place to celebrate a special occasion or have a romantic dinner date without breaking the bank too, too much. Although the ambience is more upscale, you can still have a casual lunch or dinner here as well without feeling like you have to dress up super nicely. \\n\\nLike I mentioned before the only thing I can really nitpick about would be the service.

There was enough cheese to hold the bread and veggies together.  I consider that a plus.  The bread they use in the quesadilla is not a standard tortilla; I don't know what it is, but I liked it.  The side salad was a little on the small side, with more cheese on it than anything else, but they did use mixed greens rather than just iceberg lettuce.\\n\\nThe service was very good.

Fortunately we were able to find a space nearby on Sampson Street.  We were in line for about ten minutes before we were close enough to read the menu of ice cream flavors.\\n\\nUsually, the purpose of a menu is to help you understand your options so you that by the time you get to the front of the line you know what you want.  One employee did a great job of removing flavor name tiles from the board as they sold out and replacing them with the ones that were still in stock.  \\n\\nThe trouble was that I couldn't figure out all the flavors based on their name.  For example, one was called \\"While We're Young,\\" a tie in to the Ben Stiller movie of the same name.  I like ice cream, I like Ben Stiller but WTH does \\"While We're Young\\" represent?  I still have no idea.  \\n\\nTo be clear, I appreciate Jake's creativity.  I just don't think it's helpful to include a quirky name without also including a description about the flavor.  There's only so much questioning that the employees can endure, especially when they're swamped and just want to keep the line moving.  So if Jake's keeps coming up with fun, whimsical names it would be great if they included a brief description too.   \\n\\nAnyway, a line on the menu said that customers could only sample two flavors before placing their orders.  I didn't want to waste a pick on the Ben Stiller wild card so I sampled Brown Sugah Vanilla and Chocolate Slap Yo Mama.  I didn't love either but since I'd reached my sample limit I needed to pick one.\\n\\nThe employee said the chocolate was one of their most popular flavors and I went with that.  The ice cream wasn't super creamy but it did have a deliciously deep cocoa flavor with little bits of chocolate throughout.  Four stars for the taste and two stars for the texture; other Yelpers have described it as icy and I agree.\\n\\nI felt like I didn't get best experience because I didn't understand all the flavor options.

There just isn't any. \\n\\nI literally stumbled on Scratch when looking for a dinner idea on Yelp (they popped up under the new businesses in Orlando area). Obviously, I was a little hesitant because the reviews that were up (3 at the time) were by those who hadn't written any other reviews on Yelp...but I checked out their website and decided to try them out. \\n\\nWhen we arrived - maybe 1 1/2 hours after opening - we were the only patrons in the restaurant. I was actually a little relieved because I knew this would allow me time to take a look around without being too obvious and, let's be honest, some one on one time with the staff. \\n\\nWe were greeted by friendly voices and a welcoming atmosphere. The space is smaller but the set up is key. The entire left side wall is lined with banquette seating. There are smaller tables that can be pushed together for larger parties and chairs opposite the banquettes. The right side of the space is where the bar is located and it is a beauty. They also offer 2 small seating areas to either side of the door. We opted to sit in the corner banquette and were quickly told it was the best seat in the house. I understand why. You get a full view (save for the restrooms) of the restaurant and it's something to behold. \\n\\nOne thing you will notice, I HOPE!, is the personality of the space. It's dark but keenly lit, it's comfortable but not drab, it's intriguing but not clinical. You can see so much of who the owners are by simply looking around. From the commissioned art work by local artists to the blue fridge in the bar it's a sight to behold.  \\n\\nThe wine list is full of unique finds and the beer list is a stunner. They pride themselves on offering something extraordinarily different to their patrons and it shows. We went with a South African Viognier figuring it would pair nicely with whatever we ordered. It was a smart choice. \\n\\nWe started with the breads and spreads - housemade brioche, chunks of french and 3 spreads; strawberry white chocolate butter, blackberry jam, and baba ganoush. The spreads were flavorful and fresh. I sincerely wanted to lick the plate clean. \\n\\nWe then moved on to the: artisanal cheese which was served with plum jam, raspberries, and blackberries; the roasted beets with hazelnuts, orange, greens, raspberries, and buttermilk dressing; the pork belly adobo served with calamansi, micro cilantro, carrot puree, black rice, and scallions; the roasted magret duck breast which was presented table side with alder smoke, corn maque choux, and pea tendrils; and finished with the rock shrimp corn dogs accompanied by grain mustard, lemon mayo, and micro greens. \\n\\nDid I mention there were only 2 of us? No? Hmm...well, at the risk of sounding like a mother choosing her favorite child I will have to admit the pork belly and duck were both showstoppers. The roasted beets were beautifully plated and delicious (and I don't like beets). The corn dogs were fun but upscale. And who doesn't love cheese? Seriously, it's cheese. On a plate. Already cut up for you!? But delicious, nonetheless. \\n\\nNot one to let her waistband tell her when she's had enough we moved on to dessert. This particular evening Scratch was offering a chocolate torte and vanilla bean creme brûlée. What's a girl to do? We ordered both. Seemed logical enough.  The chocolate torte was described as a flourless chocolate cake type dessert when, in fact, it should have been described as transcendent. Period. I swear, I heard angels singing. The creme brûlée was flecked with vanilla bean, smooth, creamy, and the top caramelized to perfection. We finished the night off with coffee - french press, because you can get more than just perc here. \\n\\nKey thoughts: if you get the breads & spreads and run out of bread do ask for more. If you order the pork belly adobo please follow the suggestion and squeeze the calamansi over the top. If you are interested in the art work, see if it's for sale - some of it is! You should also sit in the corner banquette (unless I'm there!)\\n\\nIt doesn't take much for a restaurant to fail but when a restaurant this good comes to your neighborhood you need to embrace her. Scratch is a labor of love and passion, of will and wit. You cannot leave here feeling anything less. You just have to go. There's something special about Scratch.  \\n\\nScratch has just opened up in the Winter Park area and are located next door to All Fired Up on Fairbanks.

For the Groupon, you can choose from these 4 options: Kokuton, Shio Tonkotsu, Akamaru, and Paitan Chicken.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we had to wait a very long time before we were able to enjoy our ramen. After over 45 minutes of waiting for our orders to arrive, we decided to follow up with one of the servers only to find out that it hadn't even been rung into the system! At this point, we were quite disappointed that our initial server who had taken our orders did not realize or attempt to follow up with the kitchen. I thought she was aware since we made eye contact several times while we were waiting. We thought that she must have noticed since other people who had arrived much later than us received their food already and were leaving!\\n\\nOnce the restaurant staff was made aware of this, one of the more senior members (possibly a supervisor/manager) came to us and apologized. He said that we could order anything we wanted from the dessert menu to make up for the inconvenience. He also took our orders and assured us that they would be made right away.\\n\\nI ordered the Akamaru Ramen ($13.50) which is a spicy pork broth with green onions, mushrooms, chashu, and ajitama egg. On the menu, this one had 4 chili icons next to it! I'm glad our server asked how spicy I wanted it (I asked for medium). Otherwise, it definitely would've been too spicy for my taste. It was pretty good but I think I prefer the Kokuton which is their most popular ramen.\\n\\nMy sis got the Paitan Chicken ($13.50) which is a lighter broth made from chicken. It had bamboo shoots, lotus, green onions, watercress, chicken chashu, and an ajitama egg. This one was a lot lighter but still had good flavour. However, the chicken chashu was too salty.\\n\\nThere was actually another misunderstanding with our complimentary dessert as one of the servers said they could only offer us one ice cream (strawberry, matcha, or yuzu honey) for the two of us... We originally ordered the matcha ice cream but thankfully, the supervisor/manager came back to check up on us and asked if we had decided what we wanted for dessert. We then ordered what we really wanted, which was the Matcha Creme Brulee ($5) and the Panna Cotta with Brown Sugar ($5). \\n\\nThe Matcha Creme Brulee was amazing!! It was by far the best part of dining here today. It was rich with creamy matcha flavour and the blueberries on top added a pop of tartness. The caramelized sugar on top was was perfectly crispy and sweet. Although we got this one on the house, I wouldn't mind paying $5 to order it again next time.\\n\\nThe Panna Cotta with Brown Sugar was also really good. It wasn't too sweet at all and the panna cotta was set perfectly. Both of these desserts were much better than expected and by the end of it all, we were actually pretty satisfied. The supervisor's great customer service and his initiative to offer us complimentary desserts honestly made up for the blunders of the other staff.

I've only been a handful of times (mainly due to going there only to find they've already closed for the day), but each time it has been a delight to eat their creations.\\n\\nOne thing: you WILL wait for your food.  I'm talking a minimum of 15 minutes or so.  This is because many like-minded, and hungry individuals have already placed orders for food, and they can only cook so many orders at a time.  Why not grab a coffee, or other beverage at one of the nearby food carts to pass the time?\\n\\nThe breakfast burrito is my absolute favorite... and spend the extra buck to add bacon.

They tell the true tale. Let me take you through my visit part by part.\\n\\n1. Entrance. This place is rediculously large. There's basically an atrium entrance that's completely tacky as hell. Huge chandelier up top and a pond with stairs over. Sound nice? Well, there are huge typed signs hung everywhere: don't climb. The stairs over the pond have trees on them so you don't cross over it. There are half dozen tacky arcade fans and claw machines and candy dispensers all with gigantic warnings not to bug management about them as they're play at your own risk. Makes the place so tacky. Seriously this entrance atrium is bigger than the seating area. \\n\\n2. There's a large sushi area that initially looks good, but sushi was sadly all limp, tasted the same, and just wasn't the right temperature. The cold ones weren't quite cold enough and the tempura ones weren't hot. I'd planned to eat a lot, but after one plate I stopped. \\n\\n3. Food. Tons of variety, but again, major temperature issues. I was there at 5pm, food was coming out, but just not hot. The sweet and sour chicken was partly ice cold in the middle, simply chilly in others. Very few other dishes passed the test of even being warm. \\n\\n4. Hibachi was good, finally hot food. \\n\\n5. Didn't try the Pho. I couldn't figure out what to do as the signs said to give fresh food to a cook and fill soup behind me. Well, behind me was all kinds of soup, but not really Pho broth. I guess I could've dumped it in Wonton broth, but I didn't bother to. \\n\\n6. Bathrooms. They were OK, but there were just buckets and hoses hanging out under the sink in the men's room. I guess they just spray the bathroom down at night. The water spots all over the tops of the mirrors 8 feet up that never got wiped down led me to believe this to be the case. \\n\\n7. Price. Not worth the $14 or $15 for adults.

My review can be summed up in two words: Wasted Potential. In a tourism-driven city, this place should pack them in. Sadly, it does not, and I immediately noticed several major reasons why.\\n\\nNot having a Checkers near me I stopped in for my first visit during mid afternoon. I was one of four or five people in the dining room and yet the service was extremely slow. Staff was less than friendly and a couple of them were arguing with no mind to whether or not there were customers around.\\n\\nI ordered a Bacon Cheese Champ with fries and a root beer. The burger was great - in fact one of the best I had had in some time - and the fries were well seasoned but a little overdone. The drink was somewhat flat.\\n\\nHere is the major issue I have with this place. First of all it is obvious they put a lot of work into the dining room. The walls are hand painted murals with 50s and 60s icons, they have oldies playing, and the furniture is diner-esque. The sign over the counter boasts that it is the world's largest Checkers. Having said that - it is really not that well maintained. There is a game room in the back, and roughly half the games were broken. The further back you go in that direction, the more the carpet smells like urine and burger joint trash (do they take the trash out through the dining room back door or something?) Restrooms are run down and even when I went near open on my second visit, they weren't that clean and there was a hole punched in the wall near the urinal.\\n\\nThe most disturbing part of my visit happened the first time when what was presumably a female manager and an older female employee came out of the kitchen and had a full-on argument in the dining room in front of the few customers that were there. This went on for a good five minutes with voices being raised, employees huffing back through the kitchen door, etc.  It was reminiscent of a scene you would see on one of those restaurant or bar \\"rescue\\" shows.\\n\\nThe only reason I came back a second time was because of how fantastic the burger was. The second meal (a Big Buford with bacon) did not disappoint. While the small sized value meal was not enough food, the medium was too much and I could not finish it.  The menu is so varied you could probably order something different every day for a month and not eat the same thing twice.  If this place wants to survive, the crew needs to start getting along, working as a team, paying attention to detail and being respectful to and around customers.  Otherwise the World's Largest Checkers may be no more in the near future."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I can only say YUMZ.. biscuit with any choice style selection you want in beef or veggie style is it.

On a typical day I would have spoken up, however my voice is quite hoarse today and I did not feel like shouting over the music to get her attention.\\n\\nAs someone who has been a bartender for many years I know that I was being ignored considering this bar seats only 14 or so. It is an intentional excersise to serve people  sitting on either side of someone with their card out in hand while not even acknowledging the person. She even asked the group sitting next to me if they wanted to close out despite them giving no indication that they wanted to. All while I was saying \\"excuse me\\" and holding my card up.\\n\\nA simple acknowledgement would have been enough to alleviate my annoyance as I understand what it's like to be in the weeds while running a bar solo in this industry and can sympathize.\\n\\nEventually another employee of the restaurant noticed that I'd been sitting with card in hand for 15 minutes at this point and walked behind the bar to ask if I'd like to be closed out.\\n\\nWhen a patron is coming in and spending over $50 on their meal and drinks this is no way to make them want to ever come into your restaurant again. \\n\\nI would have happily spent $100 on myself today had the service been better.

About 45 minutes later, we got our table and I ordered one Maddie cake and the Spicoli scramble with wheat toast. The portions are HUGE and flavorful, everything tasted so damn good! They do pretty well on their condiments game with salsa, hot sauce, and their special jam.

THANK YOU, YELPERS!!! This place does NOT disappoint!!! Wow, what a treat.\\n\\nI've been doing it wrong- it has been way too hot to cook lately, so I've been ordering a lot of local takeout. And I live between Inman and Union Squares, so there's no shortage of options nearby. But I've been trying to broaden my scope, because I'm getting tired of the usual spots.\\n\\nTook to Yelp, read these reviews and decided to give it a shot. I even banked on a long wait time based on others' experiences. The estimated delivery time, according to Foodler, was like 90 minutes, so I poured myself a cold beer and sat out back for a bit. When I came back inside, the doorbell was ringing. Literally 30 minutes.\\n\\nI sampled a few things- my total including tax and tip was under 20 bucks.\\n\\nThe carnitas and fish tacos are both PHENOMENAL. Everything everyone else has said about the meat flavors is accurate- it is obvious that the chefs really know what they're doing. The portions were PERFECT. I always feel a little wary about ordering tacos because I'm often disappointed by the tortilla/filling ratio.... these guys have it down. Nothing was too heavy, nothing was skimping. Perfect size and flavors. Both came with a generous portion of avocado slices. YUM.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken quesadilla. No frills. From some of the reviews, I was expecting a mexican calzone, but this was far from that. The cheese and chicken amounts were perfect, it wasn't even a little greasy. It was a little on the bland side, if you're really into spices, but the chicken was really well-seasoned and the cheese mix was also flavorful enough to appreciate. I ordered a side of guac for the quesadilla and it was clearly homemade. I liked it especially because I'm not crazy about cilantro, and it was barely present. The flour tortilla was nice and toasty as if it were finished off on a flat pan- not grilled- in case that is useful to someone.\\n\\nCan't wait to eat the rest of the quesadilla at a later date- it looks like it will keep/reheat quite nicely.\\n\\nI will definitely be ordering from here again, and referring all of my local friends! Do yourself a favor if you're debating, and TRY THIS PLACE."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My boyfriend and I are a couple of self-proclaimed  foodies from Los Angeles who came to Portland for the weekend to eat our way through the city. I am a huge fan of the Toro Bravo restaurant group, so we decided to go to Tasty n Alder for our first brunch. \\n\\nIt did not disappoint. \\n\\nIt is everything you could really want in a brunch place: hip modern decor, unique menu full of satisfying flavors for any craving, a lengthy and interesting cocktail menu, and a super friendly wait staff. Everything we love in our local brunch spots without the LA pretentiousness.\\n\\nWe came in on a Saturday morning, around 11am, and were told that the wait would be about 1.5 hours. Pretty standard for a busy Saturday morning, but luckily we were able to snag 2 spots at the bar almost immediately. If you're like me and actually prefer eating at the bar area to watch the bartenders make drinks, this is the best way to go. There is also a standing area near the bar that you can go to while you wait for a table. \\n\\nSide:\\nMaple Cumin Glazed Yams - If you're a Yam fan, this is a MUST. So savory. The skin is seasoned and glazed perfectly.\\n\\nMeals:\\nKorean Fried Chicken - eggs done 2 ways, Kimchi, and a sweet/spicy sauce on the fried chicken. So filling and delicious. One of my favorite breakfasts the entire weekend.\\nTasso Ham Hash - perfect brunch food. My boyfriend did not look up once he got his food and wolfed it down. \\n\\nCocktails:\\nKentucky Peach - bubbly bourbon and peach cocktail \\nOregon Orchard - bubbly gin and apricot cocktail \\n\\nMost of the reviews that are less than 5 stars have complained about the wait. Obviously it's one of the more popular places in Portland, so plan your day/time accordingly. We got lucky and waited no more than 5 minutes, but honestly this place is worth the longest wait.

Its new wing is nice looking and modern, but still blends in with the rest of the museum. There is an expanded sculpture garden which is outside the back entrance. Another addition to the museum is the new cafe. The Schokko Cafe has a few salads and sandwiches which are about $10. It's branded by Cameron Mitchell, which means the food will be good but overpriced. This is the least important part of the museum for me, because I come to see the art, and have never cared about the cafe. I like the layout of the museum. They have contemporary stuff where it will better hold the interest of kids. It has the more traditional paintings and sculptures on the upper level. There you can find O'Keefe flower paintings and it's quieter so you can really contemplate the artwork. \\n\\nThe museum still has free admission on Sundays.

Our waitress was a seasoned professional attending our every need.  We started with perfectly prepared calamari.  (Not rubbery, over fried, or over seasoned but tasted like seafood.)  Then we all had an assortment of salads.  My Caesar was the best.  It didn't look like a traditional Caesar but it tasted better than one I've eaten in a long time.   We all found our dishes delicious.   Lemon pasta with shrimp, pork chops, and a scallop dish.   Our main dishes were between 42 to 58 dollars each.   Wine selection was o.k.

I got the chicken x clam ramen because it looked like a unique offering. In the end, it was... different. I actually didn't think the clam meshed well with the chicken and ultimately wouldn't recommend paying the extra $1-$2 for clam as opposed to the regular chicken ramen (despite never having had the chicken ramen.)\\n\\nI liked that the broth was really light, because normally I find pork broth to be too heavy and/or salty. However, I almost thought the broth here was TOO light... especially compared to the chicken broth at Marutama, which is considerably creamier.\\n\\nThe ramen came with two pieces of cha-siu, and you can choose between pork, chicken, or one of each. I tried one of each, and liked the texture of both, which were both very soft and tender. I think ultimately I prefer pork topping on my ramen, but the chicken here is not bad.\\n\\nOther comments I have are with regards to the noodles (a bit too thick for my liking) and the strange decision to provide super large spoons and bowls that taper down quite narrowly at the base. I made a note of this because it actually made it kind of difficult to eat at times (the spoon would hit the sides of the bowl in odd/uncomfortable ways.)\\n\\nIn the end, I like that this place is trying to do something different and the various chicken-based options that they have. I wouldn't mind coming again to try their regular chicken broth, although ultimately I prefer Marutama as a whole. The chicken x clam bowl I got was pretty pricey actually ($12.25) and I had to pay extra to add an egg on top of that, which ultimately made it quite an expensive bowl of ramen.

Since Tasty N Alder is downtown, you can easily go shopping in the area, eat dessert a few doors down before dinner, or just wait. \\n\\nThe restaurant isn't that large with a bar, limited counter seating, and a small to medium dining room. Luckily, the tables aren't on top of one another, so with the low lighting, it feels intimate, but you still have your privacy without hearing what's going on in the lives of the diners sitting next to you. \\n\\nThe staff are busy here, but still friendly, helpful, and attentive to any allergies you might have.

You could tell they had a good flame on the wok to sear the food, which gives it a very unique flavor.\\n\\nThe menu is small and it's designed like that on purpose.

With a $0.20 cent price difference between a small and a large, why would anyone settle for a small?  They also always give you a good amount of meat so that's always a plus.  The quality of the meats are a hit or miss though.  I would say more often than not, the meat is very fatty and chewy.\\n\\nMake sure you ALWAYS ask for a side plate of white onions (only if you like it of course).  And make sure you douse it with a lovely combination of hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, and lime juice.  Mix it all up and eat it with every bite of Pho!  It'll blow your mind!

It was nice to ensure that our food was all hot.  The order they came was questionable, but sometimes it is nice to change things up.\\n\\nThe first item that came was the smoked fish crostini.  It is cold with a crusty piece of a baguette with smoked fish on top.  This was amazing.  It had a very fresh flavor and came with a good helping of fish on each piece of bread.  \\n\\nSecond item was the crab and shrimp fritter.  They were a little greasy, but still had a great flavor.  They came with two sauces.  One was a think scallion cream sauce.  This sauce was excellent.  The other sauce is something they use for burgers.  Server said it is their version of thousand island, but very thin.  It was alright.  You don't even really need a sauce as the fritters had a lot of flavor.  \\n\\nOur third item was the pretzel roll.  The rolls were wonderful.  It also came with two sauces.  One was a gruyere cheese that was melted.  It had no flavor, but a nice consistency.  It also included a honey mustard dressing.

I arrived at a little past 11 on a Sun morning. Normally, I come a little earlier but the peak brunch crowd had already dissipated. 25 minutes later my Eggs T Murphy w/ homefries arrived.  Supposedly, this is a dish of poached eggs (plural)  on an  English muffin with honey ham w/ hollandaise.  \\nWhat was put before me should never have left the kitchen in a decent restaurant. The plate and food were tepid: the homefries had been quickly (read briefly) cooked at least an hour before and left to warm in a pan. Anyone who haseaten a cold French fry, knows that cold potatoes are unappetizing.  Only one egg was evident, accompanied by a poached egg-white mass feigning as an egg, No hollandaise was used. The ham was not cold -but not warm either, I suspect that this too, may have kissed the grill an hour earlier.  I would have expected the english muffin to have been toasted (however slightly) - but this was also a disappointment. What was there on my plate was soggy doughy bread and ham with bits of eggwhite with flavor and texture due mainly to freshly cracked pepper that I added.   This was a shame and shameful for Murphy's\\n\\nThis should never happen the food should never have been plated, the server should never have brought it to me.  This is the result of incompetence in the kitchen or worse laziness.  The server did ask if everything was fine and I said no.  ( I hate speaking up about such things but my Sunday brunches are something to which I look forward) This barely warm food just ruined my appetite and time. I just said that the food was cold and left it at that because I was exasperated by the multiple failures of such a simple dish. I paid and left my customary 30% tip -it wasn't the servers fault- but as I think about it, yes it was her fault that it reached my table.\\n\\nI'd like to give Murphy's another chance (I've been coming here for at least 20 years albeit less regularly than in the past,) but maybe it's time to move on."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The first restaurant I had to try when coming to Boston was Neptune Oyster, especially after hearing countless rave reviews about their oysters.

I have heard from others that it is best to wait in line before the restaurant opens in the morning to ensure a spot. \\n\\nEven though the estimated wait time was very long, we ended up getting a call from the hostess around 45 minutes after putting our name down. Also, the time goes by very quickly, since there's the Boston public market around the corner and a lot of bakeries, in case you want to try Boston's cannoli to hold you over in line. The restaurant is also very small, with only a few tables and only some bar seating. That day, we were seated at the bar, which we were more than happy to take, given the long wait at the restaurant. \\n\\nBetween the two of us, we shared a warmed lobster roll with butter and a half a dozen of oysters. The lobster roll was around $30, but it's plenty for two people. It comes with either fries or a salad, but I would definitely recommend the fries if you're not ordering anything else that's too heavy. The fries were thick cut, crispy, and seasoned with just the right amount of salt. The lobster rolls come in either the cold-mayo form or the hot butter form. We opted for the hot butter recipe and it was delicious! It was piled high with thick pieces of tender lobster, and not over dressed with butter. The oysters were also as good as hyped to be--super fresh, sweet and buttery!\\n\\nIf you are looking for the ultimate, Boston-seafood experience, Neptune's Oyster is a bucket list item that needs to be checked off.

But upon walking in the boy came up to the counter to take our order and we let him know this was our first time and so he explained the menu a tad but then as we started to ask questions he started to walk away as if he had more important things to. Not only that but there was never a smile or any kind of greet from either the girl or boy. Thank goodness for the manager which is the only reason I'm even giving 2 stars. He wasn't smiley but he was ATTENTIVE. He didn't act like there was nobody at the counter so he could continue his other work. \\n\\nNow onto the pizza, it looks delicious when you get it and it's hot and steamy, loads of pepperoni.... but it's just bland not a lot of flavor and the crust was ok but definitely not my favorite. \\n\\nThen there's the play area, which does NOT seem to be very maintained at all... there's a little mini Ferris wheel but nobody to operate it so I guess it's for decoration, then there's a little carousel which is operated by a light switch so there was some older kid messing with the little kids... but also if the kids are in there alone what are they supposed to do run over hit the switch then jump on it while it's turning?!? Same thing to shut it off... \\nThe play structures of course the kids love but were pretty dusty which is what it smelled like when you walked in musty dusty old carpet. \\nThe only reason I say anything is because my husband has worked at pizza places like this when he was a kid and they were not aloud to let the play area look like nobody cared about it. \\n\\nI guess one cool thing about this place was the size, there is so much room inside for plenty of people to sit and it was clean in the lobby so you can see that the kids do their jobs but just don't have time for customers."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"When we looked up good brunch place in Portland on google, Tasty n Alder came up. It had impressive ratings and pictures so we were excited to go. It's a rookie mistake to come to the Tasty n Alder on a Sunday brunch time thinking there would be room. It's packed. We were on the list for about an hour and 30 minutes. Props to our hostess that gave us that accurate timing tho!\\n\\nOf course, because of the hype, we waited and walked around the area which was nice. They have a pen and paper system of waiting so it's a little archaic to come back exactly at 1.5 hours instead of having a buzzer system on the phone but I digress. \\n\\nWe ended up sitting at the bar area where we got to see the kitchen in action which was entertaining. For food, we ordered the Korean Fried Chicken and the Bim Bop Bacon and Eggs. The Korean Fried Chicken was alright. It was a little soggy by the time it got to us and the fried chicken didn't have the crispy crunch to it as I usually like my friend chicken to be. The bim bop bacon was okay as well. They had an interesting take on the picked veggies which I thought was a unique touch but I feel like I've had better ones before.The two Korean dishes were alright. It didn't wow me. \\n\\nAlthough the dishes we ordered were lackluster, I would try the Tasty n Adler again.

When I write this review, I am not trying to be rude or anything but I really did feel confused when I came here. \\n\\nOur trip was coming to an end and thought we would swing by here since it had such good reviews. We've been in Boston for 5 days now and we have already tried two different Lobster Rolls at two different spots. Both spots did not impress us at all since we've heard nothing but amazing things about these lobster rolls that are famous in Boston.\\n\\nI walked in and thought the decor was very inviting. I took a look at the menu and there wasn't much there to read, only a few items to choose from. I ordered the Lobster combo (comes with a side of Soup and a drink), price was $27. There was an option to upgrade to the \\"Jumbo Roll\\" for an extra $6.50. My wife never likes to eat an entire sandwich and thought it would be perfect for us to split (she would eat half and I would eat the other). SOOO I upgraded to \\"Jumbo Roll\\"... Man, was I disappointed with what they brought out. They brought out the same size sandwich I had at the other two spots. So, of course I had to ask if this was correct. They told me that was in fact the \\"jumbo roll\\". I kept thinking to myself, no way in the world this could be it, it was the same damn size. \\n\\nWhat it boiled down to was the \\"normal\\" size is about half the bread and only 4 ounces of Lobster. The jumbo size (normal to me) was the normal size bread (about two inches bigger), and it comes with 2 more ounces of meat, totally 6 ounces of Lobster. No where in this place is this explained nor are there any examples of sizes for which these come in when you order. My wife and I would have never ordered the jumbo if we had even the slightest clue. \\n\\nLesson learned I guess..... Wife ended up ordering a large portion of Clam Chowder for $10.. $10!!!! I understand Boston is known for the sea food and such, but hot damn that was expensive for a little bit larger than a cup of clam chowder. Either way, she ordered it and ate it. It was good (I had the smaller portion with my combo). \\n\\nWe ended up spending $47 for what appeared to be a semi-fast food restaurant. I am not too worried about the money but wasn't expecting that what so ever. \\n\\nI gave them 3 stars because even though the sandwich wasn't what I considered to be \\"Jumbo\\", it was the best one I had in Boston!!\\n\\nI just feel maybe they could be a bit better in explaining exactly what \\"jumbo\\" means on their menu. And I feel their prices are a bit higher all around.  \\n\\nIf you're looking for Clam Chowder, order it at a restaurant and its going to be better quality and a couple dollars cheaper (depending on the dining place of course, fine dining which Lukes Lobster is not, it will probably be around the same price or more). \\n\\nIf you're looking for one of the best Lobster Rolls I've tasted (that's a total of 3 my entire life LOL), come here and get the Roll ONLY!!"},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"4759 Irlo Bronson Memorial Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2","text":"Not well-managed.

We originally planned on going to the Publick House, but considering we were going at prime time on a Saturday night and they don't take reservations, we rethought the plan.  American Craft seemed like the better option since they take reservations.  It was really chill in there, much less stressful than the Publick House, so it was definitely the right decision.\\n\\nI can't drink right now, so I tried one of the Grown-Up Sodas (dry cranberry lime) while the mister got some sort of specialty brew.  I was quite pleased with my soda and he loved beer #1.  For food, we tried most of the vegetarian options: the zucchini fritters, the spring pea risotto, and the marinated tofu with cheese tortellini and tomato ginger broth.  The fritters were remarkable.  They were crunchy on the outside and smooth on the inside - just perfect - and served with some sort of creamy and yummy dipping sauce.  The risotto was truffled, which was nice, and it was cooked very well.  The tofu was my least favorite dish, mainly because I'm not sure the components were all working together (so many things: chick peas, other types of beans, tomatoes, tortellini, tofu, all in this super strong broth).  Each of the things tasted fine on their own, but they weren't really working in harmony.  \\n\\nThe service was pretty good.  There was a situation where the mister ordered a certain beer and was served a beer he knew was not the right beer.  The waitress, two bartenders, and the bar manager swore up and down that it was the right beer, but finally when the bar manager tasted the beer, he realized that they were mistaken.  They did fix the mistake, but it took a lot of coercing and time to make them believe him.  So that was mildly annoying.  But other than that, service was fine.\\n\\nI like that American Craft is much more Publick House-esque than its predecessor.  The decor is quite lovely and the food suits my fancy, so I'm a fan."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Had brunch today!

She gave us NO time to claim our table and created an awkward situation by having us and the other group stand next to each other wondering who was going to be seated since she obviously passed us up without without waiting for more than 30 seconds after calling our name. Would you believe it, she gave the table to the group after us and had us wait even longer.

It's a chain (which was the first red flag for me) but everyone assured me that this place was the best location out of the group. \\n\\nAnd it's the truth! We've been here 2 times within a 3 day period because it was that good and we cannot wait to go back. We love the affordability, quality, and options for sushi here. I like how tightly they are wrapped so that the fillings aren't oozing everywhere as I've had elsewhere. The fish is fresh and plentiful for the rolls. We also like the salmon garlic nigiri and the sea bass. So good, so refreshing, so yummy! The nigiri rice is so flavorful, there's a touch of sesame, a bit of vinegary crispness....so good! \\n\\nFor 2 people, we typically spend 30-40 dollars and leave pretty stuffed. For me, that's a good deal. I don't typically order bento. Usually we order raw rolls, one cooked roll, and some orders of nigiri. I'd be interested in trying specials next time now that I know it's some place that I want to come back to. \\n\\nIt's a small shop and there aren't a whole lot of seats. If you come early, 5 or so in the evening, there won't be as much of a crowd. It does take longer to get your order but I attribute that to them taking their time to make really good food so I don't mind it. It took a while to get our check and when the place is busy, it's hard to get that water refill or that next order of sushi. It's so good that I don't want to detract a star though because the wait staff was very apologetic. 2 people to wait tables in a full house is difficult and I can understand the hustle."},{"name":"Sidelines Restaurant & Sports Bar","address":"6001 NE Win Sivers Dr, Ste D","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Alright I have to say this is a nice go to spot to wait out traffic.

One would be the Friday and Saturday nightlife scene, and the second would be every other time. If you're used to going to BBR during the workday for lunch or on Sundays for the food deals, you wouldn't recognize the place on a weekend night. \\n\\nAs far as weekend nights go, I'd probably give them a 3. It used to be a bit better a year or so ago, but now that Endzone is closed, the lines are ridiculously long, and it's jammed pack inside. Luckily, they did end up putting a DJ on the patio, or at least there was one the last time I was there, to draw some people from the inside to the outside. I actually enjoyed the guy out there, because the guy inside usually just plays the same shit over and over. The crowd there can be off-putting to say the least. I'd say the pricing is a little cheaper than the clubs down the street like Diesel and Sway but pricier than every other bar in the Park St. area. The bartenders are pretty cool depending on who's working. I see myself here once in a blue moon.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I've stopped in here several times during the day or around happy hour to grab a drink and some food. It's close enough to Nationwide Arena, Huntington Park, and the LC that it makes it a convenient spot for some patio drinking and eating. It looks like the menu has been revamped, but I've always thought the food was pretty good. I had the buffalo chicken wrap the last time I was here with whatever the hottest sauce is, and it was delicious. That sauce is pretty hot though! The fries were very tasty too.\\n\\nI'd probably round up to a 4 if the service wasn't so bad the last time we ate here. We did have a decent sized group on the patio, but the girl waiting on us was gone for long spans of time, and when she did come back, she'd grab a couple people's orders and peace out again without checking on the rest of the table. \\n\\nI'd say if you're interested in a place to go out to dance, you could check them out, and if you don't like it, then just head on down to another bar in the area.

I also had a coupon that I added onto the order so I only paid about $12.00 for a medium pizza. Good right? It was a good price. I was promised by 3:40 at the pickup window. So I arrived at 3:45 because I live down the street from the pizza place at the pickup window. They asked me for my name and I gave them my name with credit card in hand to pay. It usually doesn't take that long to get the order. Can you believe that I waited 10 minutes at the window???? Yes 10!!! I don't know what in the heck was going on and I couldn't get anyone's attention because they weren't there for me to ask what the problem was. Sooooo, I get my pizza after they apologized. I ended up getting an extra dollar off my order I guess for my wait. So the lady at the window was very nice and apologized for the wait. What happened next was unacceptable.  Something told me that I should've checked the pizza before driving off but because I was so hungry, I went home which is only a few minutes away. Not only was my pizza COLD but it was BURNT!

Restaurants popping up in this delicate category are far and few between, with more closures than openings. Over the years, Georgia farms have taken their time to convert to organic agriculture and many of the state laws and incentives likely don't help. Georgia is a place that for years represented the fatty, the pesticide infested and the mass produced. In other words, feed cheap, fat and be happy.\\n\\nOver the last few years, unicorns like this have started popping up to break from that tradition. It is exciting as our world needs a major transition in agriculture practices and eating from local farms as well as migrating to vegan and vegetarian meals are key components of that transition. Cultivate is one of those unicorns, but unfortunately the play is more on the trend level than that of quality or making people scream for more local food. To start off, a place that boasts coffee as one of the specialties should at least be able to provide a hot coffee. The cappuccino was barely warm upon serving, raising a minor but nonetheless evident alarm in my mind. Our waitress was quick to replace it with a regular coffee once letting her know. Chai tea latte was tasty, but also served barely warm. Eliminating hot beverages and coffee as the specialties, is essentially eliminating half of the soul that of this establishment. \\n\\nComing in to Cultivate at a point of being tortured by hunger for hours, the taste palette was open to well, just about anything and over-ordering is generally the natural culprit in these situations. The Bear Creek farms sausage balls were inedible due to the volume of salt within them. If it's local and sustainably grown animals, why does the sausage get splattered with a potload of salt? The entire point is preservation to transport long distances or keep for a very long time. Re-reading the headlines of the restaurant, this is the exact theme that eager guests are being sold to divert from. It's confusing. The avocado toast appears to be one of the initial signature dishes here per the description of guests, yet was also underwhelming. Not bad, just underwhelming. Although the H&F bread lining the bottom of the avocado toast is tasty, the amount of avocado was minimal, with pickled onions dominating the palate and subduing otherwise tasteless blend of vegetables that got added on top. It's a bread heavy avocado toast and perhaps would be of flavor for some depending on preferences, but personally can't say I'd get it again. It was a failed attempt to be unique on a classic that could have been executed through principles of simplicity and quality. But, as humans, we always keep hoping for the best. At this point in the meal, was hoping that the redemption would be on the salad front, at the very least. Yet, again a bitter disappointment in the most direct sense. The tomatoes were so sour and tasteless. Not the best way to promote people buying and eating local. Having grown tomatoes in a prior life for personal use, it's questionable how any self respecting farmer can harvest tomatoes like this. It's not surprising when getting this result from a Walmart shelf, but it is from a place focused on farm to table.\\n\\nThe only reasons this restaurant deserves recognition is the excellent server at the table we had, Alexis, who was observant, attentive and a pleasure to interact with. Might add that the nicely designed interior ambiance is fun and is nice to be in, although noise level is quite high. Beyond that, the perception is that Cultivate is one of two things. First, it could just be most concerned with selling the business venture and the farm to table concept, than executing to the very principles it promotes. Or as a second alternative, it is simply that the execution of concept to result is not there. When, on a day of desperation for a decent meal, a restaurant can't deliver the basics well, Chick-fil-A next door might be the only thing to soothe the disappointment."},{"name":"Mikasa Sushi and Ramen","address":"8777 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was excited to see that a sushi/ramen place opened up in St. Johns, especially since I wasn't a huge fan of The Sudra (formerly located in this location.)

With tip this came out to $21, which for our portion size and quality wasn't a good, or even fair, deal. My sushi was the better of the two; the salmon tasted fresh and the presentation was good, but felt a tad expensive for what it was (eight small pieces, for a fish that thrives in this region.) My wife's ramen had decent broth, though was hardly spicy and the noodles tasted like something from a package. Serving size was pretty small for the price; for a similar price you could get a much better bowl at Boxer Ramen. \\n\\nThe service was friendly, but I found it irritating that you're expected to tip when you bus your own table and set it up.

They delivered, and I ran to the North End the minute I got the call. The only point of confusion is not knowing who to tell when you arrive after the phone call. There really is no hostess, so just let someone know you're their for your reservation. We ordered 2 delicious hot buttered lobster rolls and shared clam chowder. Both were ridiculously delicious. Best lobster roll this Floridian has ever had. I can't wait for the day I get to have another one.

Neptune Oyster is must-try when visiting Boston. \\n\\nI think people will be most interest to know: how long did it take you to get in?? (All things considered) Not very long! For two, it took just 40 minutes to be seated at a table though it would have been over 1.5 hours if we had have been a table of three. It was a Sunday afternoon, around 1 PM when we first arrived. \\n\\nFirst, clam chowder. My favourite in the city, thus far. It is uber creamy with chunks of potato and full clams. We shared with two spoons and then ordered a dozen oysters. Each table comes with a chart, kind of like some dim sum places in Toronto, where you can tick boxes to indicate which oysters you would like. The star attraction to this menu is that you get to know where each oyster comes from and the tasting notes. The tasting notes! I like knowing when my oyster might come with something like a, \\"brown butter finish\\". It makes the whole experience sing. \\n\\nWe shared a cioppinio and a lobster roll, the hot and buttered version. The cioppinio is a classic seafood stew, and this one came with a slighty spicy broth and rice at the bottom. It was piled with peel n' eat shrimp, cod, salmon, clams, mussels- the whole shebang. Sometimes a cioppinio can have more of a tomato broth, but this was one was a rich yellow, like saffron. Obviously at this point, the lobster roll was amazing too! Stuffed to the brim and the bun is incredibly fluffy. When you pick up this sandwich, it feels substantial, yet light from the bun.

They have great wings--best in Boston, I would say (admittedly, I'm not a big wings person but I love their wings.  take that for either they are so good that I like them or that I don't know what I'm talking about.  know though that my wing-loving friends agree, and Boston mag voted them best in bos just this year.  so maybe I do know what I'm talking about! done with the long parenthetical now). As for the rest of the menu, pretty standard bar fare, done well, and a bit overpriced--more like a grown-ups' sports bar and prices rather than a college dive bar sports bar.  Same goes for the drinks.  beers are prob around 5-6, and vodka drinks are what you pay most other places, though I can't quote a price.  Just a good place to watch a game and get some great wings.  so all of this is what I learned the first few times I went...\\n\\nthen I go in one sunday in an attempt to find the Redskins game (don't stop reading. they're terrible, I know. and I won't defend their name. and, I'm also a Pats fan and yes, that is allowable).  So the Pats are on and I know my chances are slim of finding the Redskins, but I go in anyway.  and the bartender at Clerys, bless his sweet heart, offers to let us (for some odd reason there were about ten of us, who didn't come together, wanting to watch the game) go into a back room and watch the game.  WITH SOUND.  now, i know that he shoved us into the back to keep us away from everyone else but I don't care.  it was awesome.  our little misfit crowd had a great time watching the game, ending up bonding (and doing shots, as I recall. What? I'm too old for that) and went back several more times. LOVE CLERY's!\\n\\nFast forward to 2014.  The Redskins fans in Boston (yes, they exist) used to meet every Sunday at the Good Bar.

Don't worry, they still have the Pats on in the main room, but they put us in the back room and turn on the sound and run beer and food specials.

I didn't get the water that I asked for when my plate was picked up. However, they accidentally brought out two unsweetened iced teas to the lady next to me (cause they took so long bringing it that she asked someone else for one) so I got one of those. Btw, oddly tasted just like the sweetened tea. So after about another 10 min, the owner (I am guessing) came back and comped my meal. That was definitely above and beyond. I was a bit miffed cause I wasted a bunch of time and needed to get back to work, but didn't think it was that serious. I would have had no problem paying.

The Lobster Pansotti was delicious - my guest and I kept guessing what was inside the pansotti, and the one lobster tail was enough for the dish. The Gnocchi Funghi was flavourful - gnocchi was a bit too soft for my liking, but the mushrooms were amazing - they absorbed all the flavours from the sauce.\\n\\nQuick tip: if you park on the basement parking, the restaurant can validate your ticket and that brings down the parking fee to $3.5 or so.

Allow plenty of time for wait.\\n\\nThe quest for the lobster roll: I confess, I had never eaten a lobster roll in my life until July 2013 at Neptune Oyster.  I had always wanted to try one but never got around to it in my limited trips to the east coast, and I didn't really want to get lobster in Michigan.  This time, though, my friend Wayne L. was horrified to hear that I had never had a lobster roll, so we made it our mission to obtain some lobster rolls.  Needless to say, I was really excited, even though I had just eaten two lobsters at dinner the night before (the second lobster was officially hashtagged #lobsterofshame).\\n\\nAfter a lot of toll road craziness and maneuvering through the narrow alleys of the North End, we finally found ourselves at the restaurant.  The area by the front door was very small, and the person in front of us advised us that we had to wait to be seated.  After several minutes, the person in front of us was seated, and the server also mentioned to us that only the raw bar was available.  I was SO disappointed!  Pretty sure the server noticed my anguished-looking face, though, because she said she would check if there were any more lobster rolls left in the kitchen.\\n\\nShe came back after a couple of minutes and said that there were two more!  WHAAAT!  I thanked her profusely, and we sat down to glasses of water.  The ice-less water prompted me to order a glass of wine, and Wayne got a selection of oysters from a very descriptive menu.\\n\\nBut the lobster roll was the star of the show.  You could get either hot with butter or cold with mayo.  We went with hot, obviously.  Large, fresh, sweet, tender chunks of lobster, seasoned sparingly with just salt and pepper, cradled by a buttery toasted roll, and drizzled with melted butter.  Fries and ketchup on the side.  Conversation ceased, and I savored the religious experience that was this lobster roll.\\n\\nOf course I don't have any other lobster rolls to compare this one with, but everything just tasted so perfectly delicious to me.

There was a lady who treated us so nicely (shoulder length light browned hair) but she wasn't there on Saturday when we went. The old lady who wore glasses on had us sit at the broken table at first \\"Oh. I saw it this morning but I forgot about it. Ok. You sit here.\\" then she led us to the next table. This part was totally okay. Not issue at all. But the food! I LOVE Korean Kalbi soup and they make it so good, so this soup is always what I order. So the soup came. Literally no veggies and a couple small pieces of beef. Looked so bad. So different than what it usually is. And it looks brown. It looked so different than what I usually get. So I had a spoon of it. Oh my gosh...Can't believe they had no shame to even serve such disgusting soup like that! The soup was basically watered down soy sauce soup. So I told the waitress this isn't the way this soup is suppose to be. Then the waitress replied \\"the chef is different today.\\" So then she took the bowl and came back again. BUT the bowl she says \\"new one\\"'didn't look different than what came at first. They basically boiled it hotter. That's all. I mean, are you kidding? So I don't wanna eat it. How rude. So that old lady came and said \\"what's wrong?\\" So I told her \\"I'm not gonna eat it. This is bad.\\" So the she lifted up my bowl and told another waitress who was like 10 feet away and basically yelled \\"She says she is not eating it!!!!\\" in Korean. I mean, sorry, but I understand Korean. I mean....Seriously? At least a waiter there was a nice. And waitress was nice. The old lady got a major old lady \\"I don't give a sxxx\\" attitude. Sad, but not going back."},{"name":"RusTeak Restaurant & Wine Bar","address":"1568 Maguire Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"What an awesome experience this place was!\\n\\nI knew I had to eat here after trying their food add a Yelp event. We went way out of our way to come here.\\n\\nI want to point out the restaurant is in a strip mall on the corner. It was somewhat difficult to see from the road and depending on which way you come you may have to make a U-turn to get into the Plaza. Parking was tough, being a strip mall you don't want to park in front of the nail salon and take up their spots.\\n\\nI'm not much into art unless it's crazy, weird, unusual or somewhat nerdy. They had all of this in different works all across the restaurant. Is very cool and very trendy. When you walk into the men's bathroom you fine Stewie staring you down. A little bit creepy at all but I guess it was my time to get use to go to the bathroom in front of a baby in the event but I ever actually have an accident of my own.\\n\\nI believe the food here it's called Fusion. They mix two different types of stuff together and it works out well. I had Kung Pao tacos. Their Kung Pao had such a great peanut flavor. Somehow it tasted like they milked the nuts and then sauteed the shrimp in nut juice and then added some delicious Kung Pao and some more peanuts for that nutty crunch. I was very happy with my meal.  I forget what the app is that we got I want to say fried risotto balls. There are the most delicious balls I've ever put in my mouth I had the pleasure of tasting! These things are so good but you can't just bite one of the balls at half you have to pop the entire ball and spoons more that sauce all over the ball before you bite down on it enjoy the flavor explosion in your mouth. The sauce at such a good garlic flavor. If for any reason you come here you must try their deep-fried balls. Again, I forget exactly what they are but if you use my description above they will know exactly what you're talkin about.\\n\\nSome of the menu items here are pretty expensive. I feel the restaurant is definitely described as a hipster spot and that's where most of the pricing comes from. Because I doubt that the rent a strip mall is more expensive than the rent and Downtown Disney area we got the prices are the same or more is it downtown Disney restaurant.\\n\\nWe came, we tried, we enjoy, we recommended to friends. I suggest you do the same."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I went back to Portland in April 2018 and again this was the first spot I went to after landing.

That plate of fried pickles and jalapenos was so filling and HUGE. I wish my plate of buffalo shrimp was just as big because it was so good, but I would have needed to be rolled out then. \\n\\nCheap beer and I liked the way the menu was laid out with a few lines of descriptions, not overkill and overwhelming as some places do now. \\n\\nStaff were interesting...I'm not talking about the service itself, but the fact that our server didn't know what a flash drive was (my friend gave me one, I couldn't reach my purse, so I left it on the counter). He said he didn't know anything about that computer stuff. \\n\\nThey won't seat you without your whole party, which makes sense because the place is small but everything moves fast enough so you shouldn't be waiting too long. \\n\\nWe sat at the 'bar' by the oven, and watching the meat come out and be cut up and it was almost enough to convert two vegetarians."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It's pretty obvious but just come here and get the lobster roll, it is delicious!

A fellow Meetup person recommended it. It was awful. I'm pretty vegetarian, and am very selective of the fish that I ate. This place was heavily meat based.  The only thing really veggie was the grilled cheese, but I was afraid taht they would use cheap American cheese so I passed. I had a coffee and tater tots. They were $4.25 for a lot of tots!!  Everyone had huge servings!! THose who are healthy eaters..this is NOT the place for you. No hummus/pita, veggie burger, nada.  I was really disappointed. In the service too. They seemed more keen on the regulars there. The service wasn't horrible, but not overly great either.  I wasn't expecting it to be though I guess.  A plus about the place though is that it appeared to be clean and spacious..lots of tables.  I wouldn't go back here though.  Just me.

This place came up on our search and we're huge Italian fans /critics do we decided to give it a try. Plenty of parking and welcoming as soon as we got out of our car. Walking in, we passed a guy with takeout wafting amazing smells... Something that smelled like a combination of heaven and my hubby's lil old Italian grandma's cooking.\\n\\nWe were seated promptly Ave greated by our waitress Renee. Wonderful lady. Ordered drinks and food... Keep asking for \\"house\\" everything... The wine, the salad dressing, the \\"house\\" has wonderful taste!  We ordered stuffed shells, chicken parm and eggplant parm. All so good and so fresh. I loved that the stuffed shells were freshly boiled and stuffed - not baked and over-smothered.. They were topped with amazing fresh red sauce. We left there stuffed and on cloud nine. \\n\\nI also wanted to mention the staff, because they had something you don't sense very often anymore... A real sense of pride for the place. Listening them taking orders in-person or for takeout calls, they are just as excited about your food as you were. They are friendly, engaged, and thorough about making sure everything was covered for you...from sides to toppings. There was also a great sense of comraderie between staff members as they prepared for the Friday eve dinner rush and made sure they all felt supported and ready to go. A great vibe for us, as patrons, to sense. \\n\\nAll in all, great food, great people!

His loaves and sourdoughs are consistently sold out early in the day. I arrived at noon, and the only thing they had left were cookies.\\n\\nFor bread, it would be good to order it a day in advance or to arrive early. I've seen sourdoughs in other places, and I've seen loaves in other places. But I've rarely, if ever, seen a whole wheat sourdough. And there are special offerings which you may need to check on Facebook for details (or call). A lot of the breads are around $7, reasonable comparing to supermarket competition.\\n\\nSo I came, no bread - but $4 cookies, which I wasn't going to get until someone mentioned pecan chocolate chip and that it was warm. So I caved in - and these cookies are two-thumbs thick! Crusty on the outside and oozy in the middle - definitely rich and good.
