We ordered artichoke dip and he had fish and chips, and I had chicken strips.\\n\\nThe fish had one piece. From a marketing standpoint, it would have been very smart to cut that piece of fish into two, and make the brain think there is more than just one piece. My husband's first comment was, one piece? \\n\\nThere were 2 pieces of chicken. Both servings had a large amount of fries that were very tasty. \\n\\nIt took about 20 minutes to get our food. Well, our server totally forgot about us. The dip was warm/cold. It was pretty average, and the chips were the same kind I get at the store. \\n\\nThe chicken strips were very chewy and not tender. The fish had good taste and was just a tad bit too greasy. The fries were actually the best part of happy hour. Our server was very nice, but she seems like she forgot our food when she came by our table and realized we still didn't have our food. \\n\\nThe price was great for happy hour and although it wasn't the best, we'll come back again.

I think some subconscious inner voice worked hard to make me assume that this establishment wasn't all that, and more. Perhaps I thought the themed nights were so last year? Why don't they advertise what theyir serving on other nights of the weeks? So clich√©? Wrong!\\n\\nGot to The Kitchen about 10 till 6. By 6 pm, there was a steady line formed behind me. This is a popular spot, come every Tuesday. Why? Taco themed night! Every Tuesday you can count on the folks at The Kitchen to curate a fun themed evening of tasty homemade tacos. This evening was benefiting Planned Parenthood. \\n\\nI absolutely flip for communal seating. These long tables are just that -- perfect! An eclectic mix of comfy refreshed chairs and huge tables scream open seating - awesome way to get to know the people around you. \\n\\nThe food was decent. The best local food I've ever had? No. Could it just be this time? Sure. Will I pay attention more to the final product, next time, and less on the mental images I'm forming? Yes. \\n\\nMy tacos were good. Of course the barbecue pork on the Aloha was the best. I loved the few pineapple chunks. The sweet barbecue sauce was right down my alley. The \\"Means Family\\" taco was on the drier side. Couldn't pull out any discerned flavors or tastes. Like it needed either a thicker sauce to accompany, or stuff needed spices/seasoned/marinaded. \\n\\nI got their Laugh side to-go. That was their salmon ceviche dish. Had it the next day. I think I was instead given Celebrate...? Didn't check till I got back home. Here's the thing: There were no tomatoes in my dish; I also couldn't really taste soy-ginger (and I love ginger!)... it could have used more punch. \\n\\nI will definitely return to TK. The themes alone have peaked my interest! 90s music mixtape? Yes.

Perhaps it was because we were all freezing! \\n\\nVanilla Cupcake (since this was my first time here and I base all of my bakery experiences on vanilla cupcakes). It was just OK. The bread didn't have much flavor and there was not enough frosting. \\n\\nKey Lime Tart - I asked if it was baked that day and was told that it was. Sadly it tasted like it was in the case for at least a week. The lime curd lacked in the zesty flavor i've had at other places and the shell was hard and tasteless. I was hoping for a crisp buttery crust but no such luck. \\n\\nTorrone - I was worried about this since it was really hard when I got it (and I had never tried it before) but it was really tasty! I love all of the almonds and you can actually taste the honey. I'll break off a piece to satisfy my sweet tooth every now and then. I would definitely come back for this alone.

Turns out the food delivery for the day had not arrived so they were short on a lot; not the fault of the waiters I understand.  Yet, they seemed to not know what they didn't have because one of us ordered ceviche and it was quite some time after our order was taken that we were informed that there was no ceviche since there was no delivery.  The waiters kept disappearing for long periods of time; so long that one guy got up and left without paying and one couple left their cash on the table.  It sat on the table for almost 30 minutes where anyone walking buy could have just picked it up and the waiters were unaware they had left.  We received our food and one of us asked for guacamole and the waiter said it had been 86'd.  He then said they were out because of the delivery not being there.  I don't think the waiter understood what being 86'd means.  Our bill came as one bill and we asked for it to be split among the 5 of us and we were told that it was too difficult to split on the computer so the waiter tried to do the math in his head and kept coming up with different numbers.

Maybe you were a fan of that Chocolate Factory book like I was. I was hoping to see some little oompah-loompahs running the show inside, but no go. Up front in this busy restaurant they've got a fun candy shop decked out in lots of gilded metal and neo-Victorian decor. After a 20 minute wait we're brought into a lovely, 2-layer dining room that looks rich and full of architectural details. The menu comes in a large thick binder and is full of American comfort food classics. Portions are huge, our Tot-chos is a huge platter of cheesy tots and barbeque. And my meatloaf is two thick slices of deliciousness with fried onion strings and mushroom gravy. Oh and the shakes? Definitely share one if you visit. \\n\\nService was spot-on and attentive throughout the meal even though the place is quite busy. Very well-trained staff.

I had the strawberry cheesecake shake - it tasted exactly like strawberry cheesecake and was topped with whipped cream, a small piece of cheesecake, and a chocolate covered strawberry. The flavor choices are very tempting! My only insignificant complaint would be that the milkshake was very thin - more like very cold milk than a traditional milkshake.

If Mike's is not the most famous bakery in Boston, it's definately the most popular in the North End.  Yes there is usually a line outside the door, but for good reason, it's fantastic!  Everything about this place is great.  A lot of the help is straight off the boat from Italy, the ambiance is like you're in Rome, and all around a great experience.  You walk in and see maybe about 15 tables, showcases of there extraordinary talents, from there marzapan, to cookies, to cakes, to bread, gelato, etc...  Although you see vanilla and chocolate cannolis in the showcases, the key to this establishment is to order the traditional cheese cannoli.  You order one.  They go in the back, fill the perfect cannoli shell with the perfectly prepared ricotta cheese and sugar blend and they bring it out to you.  Hands down the best cannoli I have ever tasted in my life!!!!  I'm about to fill you all in a secret treat that they offer.  Of course get at least one cannoli, but if you really want to try something that you have never experienced before get the rum square.  Vanilla sponge, a vanilla filling, vanilla sponge, a chocolate filling, whipped cream and a cherry on top, while the sponge has rum in every layer or vanilla sponge.  I for one do not have a sweet tooth whatsoever!  But Mike's has a technique, has the perfect recipes, heck I don't know what it is, and I really don't want to know because I want to enjoy the experience everytime!!!

As luck would have it, I was yesterday (6/18/11).\\n\\nI got there and sat myself, and was promptly brought a glass of ice water and a menu. I ordered the regular-size haddock and British chips (and made that decision based on the description that British chips are fresh cut). They were the most delicious fish and chips I've ever had, EVER. The food is cooked in animal fat, according to the menu, but in all honesty from how un-greasy the batter was, how light the crust on the batter was, and how moist and fluffy the fish was, you'd never be able to tell that the fish was fried! The 3 good-sized pieces of fish and the chips were just the perfect amount for someone who hadn't eaten at all yet!\\n\\nThis shop is fairly easy to find, and has a decent layout seating-wise. They had the end of the Man. United and Man. City match on when I got there, so I had something to focus on during my wait. The table that I sat at looked like it hadn't been wiped down thoroughly but I didn't mind; it was just salt.\\n\\nAbout the only complaint was that, as a compulsive water-drinker, once my glass was empty I was never asked for a refill.

For someone who has a bit of a science background, I really appreciated this feature. Also their seating is a bit different from your standard booth/table. I'm not sure how to describe it... kind of like a booth with an offset mini table extension.

Candy is available should you want some. House made varieties you take little jars and fill them up with. It's something reminiscent of olden times when you used to go to the drugstore to buy candy. Then there are truffles and chocolates and beautifully made confections for you to chose from. Then of course there are chocolate bars and stuff outside the glass cases you can also chose from. \\n\\nIf that's not your thing and you are into ice cream sundaes or milk shakes then you will be in absolute heaven.

I used to defend them on social media when people complained about their style of pizza. I know what Neopolitan style is, and I gave them the benefit of the doubt as they worked their tweaks out. The only thing I still recommend is the music and the relaxed vibe. Their pizzas have gone up and up in price while giving you less and less. A $17 pizza (yes, the size of a SMALL pizza, as Neopolitan style) had only a smattering of ingredients and was an unforgivable soggy texture that was a) so thin it was barely there b) so wet it could not manage to be called a \\"crust\\" as it had dissolved. What was weird was that the crust on the Margherita pizza was perfect and that was less than half the price as it was \\"Margherita Monday\\". Why the inconsistency? My first visit back opening month, I loved the complimentary olive app and looked forward to it every time. Next time, it took the server going back and forth to the kitchen 5 times to, in fact, apologize they were out of olives, so no app. Next time, there was no mention of olives whatsoever so I guess they did away with that nice touch all together. I think they could have afforded to keep it with the price of their pies and beers.

We ordered the chocolate creme br√ªl√©e and a plain chocolate chip cookie and brownie. The brownie and cookie were extremely hard and tasted freezer burned. The creme br√ªl√©e was not a creme br√ªl√©e. It had no crystallized sugar topping and tasted and had the consistency of jello chocolate pudding cups. Not even the service was good.

The owner showed us around (nice guy). It is all fresh and new and cozy inside. I liked the art on the walls. It was a kind of modern indian painting. They have a full bar and actually have craft beers on tap. Good beer is an extreme rarity in an Indian restaurant however it was still only 11:30 AM so I opted for a masala chai and it was good. \\nThe buffet was exceptional. I had saag paneer that was spiced a little differently than the usual and it added a new dimension to it that I liked alot. Chicken tikka masala is a dish that can easily taste like Campbell's tomato soup if it's not well made. This was not that. The chicken was obviously cooked in a tandoor and was tender and tasty. The sauce was well balanced. It was as good a CTM as I've had in years. The chicken biryani was killer. I had several other vegetarian dishes that I can't remember the names of as I write this but they were on par with the other selections. Nothing I had was a miss.

What you get are four of these crispy, salty, creamy bombs of deep-fried artery busting food art arranged on a platter of better-than-average, eat-with-a fork-marinara. The were so rich I could only eat one, but they were just as good warmed up the next day.\\n\\nAlso: nachos. I am very picky about my nachos, and I know I'm always risking disappointment when I order from a new place, but our server said they were good so we went for it. I must say, well played, Cheesecake Factory. Their 'chos are nothing fancy, just a solid example to show to places that insist on stacking up the dry chips. What is that? CF does the one-layer method, every chip enrobed in baked cheese, studded with jalapenos and served with a scoop each of guacamole and sour cream, plus salsa on the side. They're also quite voluminous. \\n\\nThe Cheesecake Factory does not boast an impressive beer list, but a 22 oz. Sam on draft suited my needs just fine.  Overall I'd be loath to come here on a weekend night, and I can't speak for the entrees or even the famous cheesecake, but for my appetizer-happy self everything was just right."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wasn't very impressed!

I ordered the pulled pork pannekoek... (try to say that 3 times fast - now that's alliteration).  I pulled out some cured pork and put it on the pannekoek add a bit of coleslaw and you have a delish savory treat!

When I ordered the grouper, the waiter clarified which grouper I was talking about by confirming that I wanted the herb crusted one (the more expensive one) rather than asking me which grouper I wanted. And finally, when someone else in our group asked to have broccoli instead of green beans (the vegetable of the day), the waiter simply said \\"we do not have broccoli\\". What kind of restaurant doesn't have broccoli? Let me just tell you about the one time I went to Roy's Hawaiian in LA and they made a cheese quesadilla (which wasn't on the menu) for my coworker who couldn't find anything on the menu that he wanted to eat - now that's a restaurant that is looking to bend backwards for their customer.

Frankly this place is run by a bunch of dudes that don't really care if you like your food - because you will come back. The concept is great - Indian food take-out/counterservice. The food runs from really good to ok depending on the time and day you visit. Not always fresh. Of course I'll keep going there, but I wouldn't if Guru the Caterer was in Cambridge (they really take pride in their food). I really doubt the guys at Punjabi eat the food they serve the public.

The place was very busy; I was surprised they had such a large Tuesday night crowd.  The restaurant had a nice feel to it, but the limestone walls and the music coming from the bar upstairs made dinner conversation difficult.  We shared appetizers of queso and chips (queso was great, chips too thick for my tastes), chick peas and goat cheese with pita bread (really good), and a fried shrimp dish (also very good).  Drinks and appetizers came quickly, but it seemed to take forever to get our main courses.  We weren't starving after the appetizers, but this turned into a 2-hour+ dinner after the long wait for the entrees.  The fact that it was hard to hold a conversation because of the noise level made it seem even longer.  The entrees were great when they finally arrived.  They had a chicken-fried steak special that night which I ordered.  It was enormous and very, very good.  My co-eaters had short ribs, pork ribs, salmon, and a steak.  We all agreed the food was dynamite.\\n\\nAlthough I have no complaints about the quality of the food, Lambert's is probably off my list of places to go just because it's so hard to hold a conversation there.  Maybe if there was no music upstairs (the music was good; no complaints about the quality, just the volume) the downstairs restaurant area would have been quieter.

I expected the wait time to be long, so there are no complaints for that. They are still fairly new, and are on Universal grounds which means high tourist traffic. We went prepared expecting to wait. A plus is that you can put your name down, and they will text you when your table is ready- it's nice to be able to walk around instead of waiting outside to be seated. We got a text after waiting for about an hour and were brought to our table. Aesthetically, it's a nice restaurant. It's Steampunk, fun and the theme is continuous from the staff uniforms, to special characters that come by to greet you during your meal. \\nIt's all downhill from here though. The food is expensive. I went with a simple chicken sandwich which was about 14$. My friend ordered a pasta bowl with chicken for 17$ and a kid's meal burger for 7$. We were told to order our dessert right away because they can take 30 minutes to be made. We both ordered a milk shake. After waiting around 15 minutes for our food, we were pretty hungry and excited to have our food. It was awful. The kid's meal burgers were charred on the outside, and very pink on the inside. The pasta bowl was dry. The chicken sandwich was just gross- I can't even think of how to explain it. The bread tasted sour, and the sandwich had a weird taste. I took two bites, and wanted nothing more to do with it. At this point, I'm hoping dessert will salvage the visit- I'm already pretty upset about paying 14$ for a below average sandwich. The dessert arrives, and at first it's pretty amazing. They're visually appetizing. I had a banana one which came with a chocolate dipped banana, chocolate whipped cream, vanilla whipped cream and a cherry on top. However- once you get past the decor on top of the shake, you realize it's just a milkshake. Vanilla or chocolate or banana- it's just a milkshake. The add-ons at the top are actually pretty simple. They've gone for impressive size to reel you in, which makes sense, but in the end you're paying anywhere from 11-14$ per a shake. I couldn't even drink half of it. By the end of the meal, I was in a sour mood. My bill, for just me- a milkshake and the chicken sandwich- was $33+. Nothing hurts bad food more than paying way too much money for bad food. \\nI would probably not consider returning to this restaurant.

My reviews and comments to my memory have always been about the quality of their food.  The heaps of deserving praise they are also getting from my fellow netizens is well deserved and of a similar grain.  However after my last few visits I need to single them out for more praise from a different angle.\\n\\nAfter my last visit it is apparent to me that this is an exceptionally well managed business.  All of their locations are done well, but they really have it down at Easton.  \\n\\nSome points on this:\\n\\n1. Every single employee I've ever encountered at every location has been friendly, warm and outgoing.  Not once has their courtesy ever seemed forced or fake.  Nor have I ever thought they are as they are because they feel lucky to have any job at all.  They act as if they've chosen to work here.  It's all enough to make me think these people actually enjoy laboring in the service industry.\\n\\n2.  I've on several occasions had both employees and managers apologize and try to make amends for what appeared to be a violation of their own very high standards.  Honestly, whatever these standards are, I think they are beyond what I'd expect.  I've had servers announce that they've taken an item off my bill upon delivery to the table because they thought it took too long.  I hadn't even wondered to myself when it would arrive.  Today I tried ordering a couple of items that had been sold out from the Sunday rush.  My third try was successful, and free.  I never even had a chance to be frustrated.\\n\\n3.  The staff is exceedingly observant and proactive.  Today I saw a manager carrying a full load of food up the stairs, deftly navigating the crowd.  While doing this she looked behind her and saw my party sitting down at a table that had a single water glass left on it from the previous occupants.  Without missing a beat she directed a server to clean off the table for us.  The server in turn appeared downright happy to receive the instruction.  She promptly came over as we were sitting and cleared the glass and wiped down the already spotless table in characteristic and congruent good cheer.  Again, I never even had a chance to hope someone would clear it.  It wouldn't have bothered me, and in the rush, I'd never have thought the less of them for what would have been a tiny oversight.\\n\\n4.  They have some pretty cool tech in there to assist them in the efficient operation.  The person who eventually (and without delay) brought our meal hadn't spoken to me, or to my knowledge seen us before that point.  However, he came straight for us, bounding up the stairs and around the corner.  I asked him \\"okay how the hell did you do that.\\"  It turns out the puck they gave me after I ordered can sense a unique identifier in each table and reports back to the line where we were seated.  This is a new system for them, if you're a long time customer.  There was no need for us customers to tinker with or hold up anything.  I'd just plopped it on the table and presumed that it would eventually light up, vibrate and scare the crap out of me when it did.  Nope.  Very cool.\\n\\n5th and finally, I've said rather often that I thought the place expensive, but I no longer hold that view.  With the product...and the service provided, it's a bargain.  As we were preparing to leave I had a few moments to observe the line in the kitchen.  I was highly impressed with the professionalism and economy of movement I saw.  Notably, at the end of the line the expediter was inspecting plating, making final confirmations and cleaning any blemishes from the dishes flying by.  I'd thought to myself that this was far beyond what I could reasonably expect from a $12 plate in a cafe within a suburban shopping mall.\\n\\nAll of this has been in the back of my mind, but came to the forefront after this last visit.  After all, when I arrived the line was literally out the door.  However, I knew that waiting would not present an issue even with my ravenous 7 year old in tow.  I wasn't disappointed.  The line proceeded at a good clip and we were greeted warmly while waiting, I was able to secure an agreeable hot caffeine suspension during that time.  The cashier was friendly, knowledgeable and patient as expected.  After all this I never felt rushed to hurry up and be on our way after we finished eating and I lingered over more coffee.  I decided it was time to go myself when I saw one party waiting to sit.\\n\\nOh...yeah and the food was great too."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't usually review things if I didn't like them, but for some reason I'm compelled to leave my review for Pip's...I guess because they're hyperbolically popular and I feel like sometimes that sort of thing just gets out of hand and stops being related to the product.

My personal favorite (though I may be biased by my extreme love for cookies) is the deep dish chocolate chip cookie served with soy caramel sauce.

Between those unique features and the long wooden tables that encourage you to mingle with other guests as you eat, The Kitchen has a homey and cozy vibe.\\nOrder your meal near the bar: the days offerings are written on a chalkboard wall. I tried three potato tacos on corn tortillas and my friend tried three different meaty tacos (chicken, pork, and carnitas). My friend has a serious food allergy to shellfish and the staff were very understanding about ensuring her meal had no contamination. We also ordered their chips and guacamole and a couple of margaritas (my friend got the classic and I ordered their blood orange margarita). We didn't realize we needed to stick around and pick up our drinks at the bar after ordering (oops) because we were given a number for our table and we incorrectly assumed the drinks would be dropped off, so keep this in mind if you're a new visitor to The Kitchen.\\nThe margaritas were a bit too tart for our liking but the tacos were delicious.

They offer a lot of variety - from local Taiwanese dim sum style to traditional Chinese dishes. I have been to this place a few times now, and we always want to go back. You can't possibly try everything by one visit. :P \\n\\nThe upstairs Sushi House has the best sushi. If you have a big party and wanted to have a more private environment, you could always reserve their tatami room. The bigger room could fit as many as 10 people. We felt very comfortable sitting in there, and didn't feel crowded at all. When the owners were there, they would even recommend to you their daily special rolls. Their sushi hasn't disappoint me."},{"name":"Chuck E. Cheese","address":"801 Worcester","city":"Natick","stars":"2.5","text":"I had my son's first birthday party here and it was awesome.

Every time we come to Disney I try to get in but its always full. So my son uses that new Disney App and tells me there is an opening at 410p on our recent trip. Bingo, I call up and we are in with a table for 4. I'm pretty stoked because we haven't eaten here in years.  \\n\\nWe show up and place still looks great and workers are all friendly. We are seated and everyone is happy especially our kids. We meet our server who was nice as pie and had a good personality. She mentions my daughters birthday and the mood is awesome. My wife orders a red wine and the cheese plate app. my son gets the \\"famous\\" cheese soup.  Out comes the comp basket of rolls with those tasty soft pretzel sticks. I ask for some mustard and I'm in heaven. The apps come out and my son devours the soup. He loves it. The cheese plate is good but nothing out of the ordinary.  So we order our main course and we get 3 Filet Mignon cooked medium  and a kids sirloin for my daughter. I also get a side of creamed spinach. \\n\\nHere is where things go south. Our dinners come out and everything looks fantastic. I cut into my steak near the edge of it and its rare. I look at it and press my finger near the center and WTF this gives like its raw in the center. I showed our server and she apologizes. I didn't want her to think I was one of those people that want medium but really want medium well.  She looked at my steak and agreed it wasn't medium.  She takes it back and I'm watching my family eat and they are laughing at me. I looked at my wife and sons steaks and they are cooked wrong too. Both are cooked rare to medium rare. I said something to them about sending them back and all they said it was fine and they continued to eat. My son even went as far to turn his steak over so I couldn't see the inside of it. So I'm starting to get alittle pissed. I start eating the creamed spinach and it has a nice cheese crisp top. I break into it and it's all watery inside. It was like spinach soup. This $hit sucks. \\n\\nSo my steak comes back out. I was surprised to see it was a new steak and not my old one butterflied, good sign. Wrong! Our server asked me to cut into the steak and the F'ing thing was rare to medium rare. She saw I was pissed. She offered to take it back to \\"fire it up\\" more. I said no and she apologized and walked away. Now folks, at 44 bucks a steak and 9 bucks for a side of creamed spinach and a bill of over 200 bucks I demand excellence. In addition, the price of admission in the park (4 adult Annual Passes) just to have the pleasure to walk in the front door. That's a $600 meal when you really break it down. I didn't even finish this 44 buck mess, see pic. My family now knows I'm upset. \\n\\nThe server comes back, apologizes on behalf of the manager, and  she comps my daughter's 8 buck dessert for the kitchen screw up. Now this is where management screws up.  The second time my steak came out the manager should have delivered it to me. He/she should have watched me cut into and see the $hit was wrong again. Right then, my steak should have been comped. PERIOD. Our server shouldn't apologize for the manager, they should speak the words themselves and see how THEIR kitchen is under performing. $hit the manager at Chilis has to run out all meals returned to the kitchen to their customers.  This place is far from a 2 for $20 gig.\\n\\nI don't pretend to be a fancy food writer or a classically trained Chef. I'm a regular guy working a regular job who enjoys good food, drink, service, and loves writing.  When I spend this type of money I want to see some damn effort and it starts with the management who worked on 07/27/13 at 410p thru 530p.  The chef who cooked my two steaks, maybe you were having a bad day not really sure. I know you are slinging steaks like crazy but slow down alittle bit. I'm sure more people have enjoyed their meals that you pumped out and you never get credit for the good stuff. So just slow down and make the food as if you were ordering and eating it. I felt horrible for our server because she was wonderful. Hard to carry the weight of the kitchen and management on your back. I tipped you 30 bucks which is way below what I would normally do. Honestly, the thought did cross my mind to go much lower, but I really did feel bad for you even though I may never see you again.

It's a little over 40.00 per person and I think kids under 3 eat free.  It's so worth the money to come eat here.  They server oysters, crab cakes, stone crab claws, crawfish, crab legs, prime ribs, chicken marsala, shrimp cocktail, clams, clam chowder, sushi, mussels, and of course LOBSTER TAILS.   They do serve more food, however, I just forgot what it is.  I mainly ate crawfish, which they serve either hot or cold, i prefer the hot ones.  it is served cajun/garic style... just a little spicy. The oysters are the typical oysters almost every restaurant sells.  It was pretty fresh.  The stone crab claws, i have one word- yummy!! they were pretty small in size and the mustard aioli is good as well.  The crab legs though, I have to complain about that.  The first batch that I ate were good, and then after that, it wasn't as great.  I felt that they over cooked the crab legs because the shells were very soft.  The lobster tails were okay.  They were small and chewy.  Once again, I think they overcooked it. My brothers and sister did however, bite into a few lobster tails that were old. I don't know if it's supposed to taste like this but I got raw clams and it tasted really fishy.  I didn't eat anymore clams after that. For non seafood lovers, they do serve prime ribs, chicken marsala, mashed potatoes, spaghetti, brocoli, rice, bread and salads. They didn't really have a big dessert bar, but hey who's there to eat desserts?? I managed to save room for dessert though.  They have a little pastry station in the corner- they served fried cheesecake balls, mini marble cheesecakes, mini strawberry cheesecake, mini key lime pies, mini red velvet cake, and mini pecan pies.  My favorite of all is the mini pecan pie.  Their ice creams were okaY.  It wasn't all that great. Our server, Cindi, was very attentive and nice.

I'm always in a hurry, have missed them, or they are already closed for the day. After seeing their teaser on Diners, Drive In's, and Dives, I was in trouble. Like all of you I started to develop a twitch and serious craving for some Seafood Chowder poutine among other delicacies. Well today my friends! I was there in time to snag a Chicken Fried Oyster 'Po-Boy', but alas the poutine was sold out. (Take note : This stuff is so good they sell right out of it) So in the name of good research, I will have to hit them up again just for the poutine. Multiple times apparently, because I am a mushroom FANATIC and these guys have a Chanterelle Mushroom Poutine too.\\n\\nNow if you're reading this post and thinking, \\"ew, Oysters!\\". Please put aside all of your negative memories brought on by previous oyster pitfalls. These are not the \\"salad bar in vegas\\" oysters, nor the \\"left out too long and have just sent your digestive tract to a very bad place\\" oysters. These are the oysters to be put on a pedestal of how to cook an oyster. Think fresh fresh fresh, just hauled out of the water for your culinary enjoyment.\\n\\nMy Sandwich arrived with a HEAPING mountain of fresh cut, flash fried, crispy as hell fries. The only thing missing was the chowda! Even without being doused in vinegar, salt or ketchup, these fries were pretty phenomenal. Super fresh and skin on. \\n\\nMy Po-Boy was a sight to behold. Oozing with fresh made tartar sauce that topped the Sawmill Bay Jumbo Oyster. Now I will admit, that like many people, I haven't had a great relationship with oysters. But this sandwich is a game changer. Battered on the outside leaving the edges crispy and delicious while leaving the inside moist and fresh. There is no unpleasant fishy taste, just simply the delightful Oyster flavor combined with the snappy tartar sauce and fresh lettuce. The oyster manages to contain its moisture while the edges (my favorite part) were crispy, like oyster calamari if you will.\\n\\nNow completely aside from the food offered up by Chef Josh Wolfe, Fresh Local Wild stands apart from many of the food carts of our fine city. Their cart is a one of a kind. Custom designed to offer their clientele a shelter from our rain forest weather. A covered table and benches that could easily seat 4-6 people cozy and warm with a view of the kitchen.They also use a completely unique source of power. Their description pulled straight off their website says it best...\\n\\n\\"Mobile power generation is never easy but it can be Green. Fresh Local Wild has accomplished an industry first by creating a power system that runs off 100% VEG oil. This means that when we have used the oil in the deep fryers to it's capacity we can pour it straight into the tank and fuel our generator. That's why we say 'Powered by Fish N' Chips\\"! An onboard intake and custom filtering system allow us to use oil from any fryer, anywhere! \\"\\n\\nSo really, the brilliant design of their cart keeps the hippies happy while the unique menu appeals to the gourmet foodies of our fine city.

This visit, however, just about changed my mind...at least for this location.   \\n\\nBefore even going in, we had to drive around to the back of the building, because the valet takes up all of the parking spots in front.  So, if you don't want to valet, be sure you wear comfortable shoes for the hike.  And get there before 5pm, because after that time, ALL parking has a fee!\\n\\nWhen we first entered the restaurant, the smell of stale beer was evident. In the entrance, a quick look upwards revealed a nasty a/c vent as well as a dusty light fixture (pics below). The hostess was less than pleasant and had a arrogant attitude.  Still, we pressed on, because we knew that we really enjoyed Senor Frogs' food.\\n\\nA few minutes after we were seated, a server named Sebastian came to our table and asked if we'd been helped yet.  We said no, and he stated that he would be taking care of us then.  Sebastian was great!   He had a great smile, was very friendly, and was attentive. He even fixed our wobbly table.  (Side note: the party sitting next to us/right on top of us, also had the same wobbly table issue.  Are these things not checked occasionally?)   The rest of the immediate dining area really screamed for some TLC...how about wiping down the backs of chairs and maybe running a dust cloth over the window sills?  \\n\\nWe ordered the beef burrito and the beef chimichanga, as well as two sodas.  The food was good, but really not worth the $14.50 for each entree.  Also, the sodas are $3.30 each!  (I'm thinking the diet gods are telling me to start drinking water with prices like that.)   The other thing that I found a little irritating was the way the food was presented.  It's a cute idea to have it on a mini baking sheet, but the execution missed the mark.  Doesn't it look like an afterthought (pics below)?   I'm also getting tired of eating Mexican cuisine off of wax paper.  Cutting through the burrito or chimichanga results in tearing the paper, and inadvertently eating said paper.  Can we all agree that this is annoying and that restaurants should stop doing this?  The only thing worse is foil.  \\n\\nOverall, this place needs help.  The prices are high for what you get ($44.00 including tip for a burrito, a chimichanga, and sodas), some of the staff need customer service training, the dining room and entry way need a good \\"spring cleaning,\\" and stop with the cutesy baking sheets/wax paper presentations.

We are planning a conference here and Lamberts was recommended by our destination management company. I received a phone call confirming my reservation at 7pm this afternoon and was really excited to have dinner there. We arrived 5 minutes early, checked in to the hostess and were walked to our table. Unfortunately they had the reservation down for 2 and we were three. I informed the hostess who by the way was not nice at all. She tried to tell me it was my mistake. Clearly I did NOT make a mistake! Then tells me well you received a confirmation call, which I do not deny but the person that called me was just confirming my reservation at 7 never how many in my party. She said they'd see what they could do. Probably be 15-30 minutes. We said okay we'd wait. About 15 minutes later the manager came to us saying I hear you had a problem with your reservation, never introduced himself, never apologized for the mix up and again blamed me!  I still can't believe this. He mentioned the confirmation call again, to which I admitted to receiving but the woman never confirmed the size of my party only the time. He said he'd check and see what he could do and I told him since it appeared to be such a problem to please let us know as we had somewhere else we needed to be at 9 and we'd find somewhere else to eat. During this wait the hostess very rudely asked us to step out of the way of other diners. The waiting area is very small and nowhere for us to stand so we asked her should we wait out in the cold? I think she got the point. We did the best we could to stay out of the way and waited. I was sure they would seat us as no one was waiting but us and some of the tables were emptying. To my surprise the manager came back and said sorry, we can not seat you. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone and have informed the destination management company so they know how they treated us and alert others. I can't imagine treating a customer the way they treated us. I guess they feel they can turn business away?

Rooms look like 1980 motel rooms. Probably because that was the last decade any money has been put into this dump. Front doors didn't work the elevators are out of order, carpets smell and are heavily worn and signs of roof leaks throughout."},{"name":"The Living Room","address":"101 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I go here because they do two things that many other bars do not: \\n\\n1) they don't have a cover (at least I've never been here when they have, I think they do for holidays maybe?)\\n\\n2) they have at least one beer on tap that is relatively cheap (coors lite in this case).  These are both areas where I am quick to judge whether I will frequent a bar and this place passes - 4 stars.\\n\\nThe living room is removed from the faneul area.  It is technically in the north end, but it is kind of in it's own little area.  This may be why it can be dead at times, usually during the week.  I should mention that they frequently allow private events during the week, which can be very uncomfortable when everyone there is part of the same group.  I would otherwise say only go during the week when you can get couch seats and relax, but beware of private party potential.  It can also get quite bust at times on the weekend, as expected with most bars in the area.  \\n\\nWhile I have never been here when there is a cover, there can be obnoxious lines.  I have even experienced the fake line here.  This is where a bouncer will make a line despite the bar being 1/4 full to create the illusion that it is a popular place.  A practice I deteste, but one that unfortunately occurs in the area.  As I mentioned earlier I do believe they have a cover for holidays (new years, etc.), so beware.\\n\\nThe food here is actually decent.  Nothing great, but everything does seem to have that little something extra that generic bar food doesn't.  I have mostly only had their apps.  While the food is generally expensive, it is similar to others around faneul, and they have 1/2 price apps on weekdays from 4-6.  I would recommend going for the 1/2 price apps.\\n\\nI think the goal of the place is to be a martini bar.  They have a martini list with monthly martini specials.  What really made me think they're going for the martini bar thing is the vat of ice with upside down martini glasses to the left when you walk into the main bar area.  I have never actually seen this vat being used though, and it is a little wierd.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, I usually get coors lite, which is $2.50 here (good barful responsibility).  However, there have been more than a few times when they are out of the coors lite.  It is quite obnoxious when they are because the walk to another bar can be cold during the winter.  I give them the benefit of the doubt and maintain they are idiots when it comes to ordering.  They must sell more coors lite than anything else and can't figure out to order a lot of it.  \\n\\nOthers have the theory that they intentionally \\"run out\\" (meaning they didn't really run out for those who couldn't figure out the quotes) of coors lite when it is busy thinking that people will stay and order a more expensive beer.  If this is the case then they deserve the vengeful wrath of yelpers, but I am not convinced.  Seriously though, they need to get there coors lite ordering act together.\\n\\nThe coors lites come in frosted glasses.  Now I enjoy a frosted glass as much as the next guy, but the glasses should be relatively dry before they are frosted.  The glasses are frozen right after they are taken out of the sanitizer here when they are still wet (many places actually do this).  While this creates ice that keeps the beer cold longer, it is sanitizer water ice - this is gross.  Watching used sanitizer ice melt at the top of your beer is not the best look (again get it together with the coors lites).\\n\\nThe crowd here is inconsistant during the week, it usually isn't busy enough for there to be a type.  On the weekends it generally attracts collar wearing types and north end skirts (slightly older than the faneul crowd and a little less sticky).  Earlier in the night there can be business types and cougars.  The cougars generally sit at the bar and sip on wine or a martini, if that is your thing.  Many also make identification very easy by actually wearing leopord print (much appreciated, it avoids uncomfortable mistakes).\\n\\nIt can get dark, which may not necessarily be a bad thing.  Some things are best seen in dim lighting.  The music can get odd.  The volume and music selection seems to be all over the place.  They have mint m&ms in a bowl by the entrance.  They used to come in packs of 2, now they are 1.  There is a fish tank.\\n\\nOverall there really isn't anything I can complain about with this place.  They are barfully responsible, there isn't a cover, the food is alright, and they have 1/2 price apps.

In addition, the menu states that AYCE with Korean BBQ occurs during the weekends, which is false, customers can get it during the weekdays too.

The guy taking my order was really spacey and didn't know how to enter the order and had to ask for directions from a supervisor who ran back and informed me they were really busy and it would be 15 minutes before my order would be ready, since I had already waited in line I said I would come back for it, went back to the office and came back 15 minutes later and the sandwich was still not ready, had to wait another 5 mins which was really annoying.   The Luigi is just a french dip and it was really good, meat was piled high and was tasty.

They are cooked crisp and perfect and I had them doused in honey mustard which wasn't good by itself, but was amazing when combined with the Jamaican sauce I asked to try on the side.  I also tried Spicy Honey and it was probably the first wing sauce I've had with \\"honey\\" in the title that you could actually tell it was made with honey.  It was a bit too sweet for me and I knew it would be sticky so I opted to mix the other two and would do it again.  They are better than BW's and Quaker Steak but not as good as Hoggy's or Mac's...close though.  \\n\\nFor dinner I tried the fish and chips.  It was okay, not my favorite, especially the fries...they just weren't good, in fact they were kinda sub par (the chips).

I tried the tiramisu. It had excellent flavour and texture and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it. I also recommend the excellent waitstaff who patiently named each thing in the case for me. There are lots of cakes with rum added so if you're buying and you have kids with you, make sure you ask which ones are safe. \\n\\nMy parents were pleased with their desserts, a cannoli and a cream puff if I remember right, and the cookies we got to share were also delectable. The different colored cookies have a nice, soft texture and the pink ones are cinnamon and taste like red hots.  We also got the italian wedding style cookies and those were delicious.

We were on the way from an appointment and we were hungry. We asked Google to show us Indian restaurants on our route. Maya popped up and then my sister had remembered that someone had recommended it to her. So on we went. Right in downtown Wakefield it's a part of the Depot Mall, right off the train tracks. Its interior is unprepossessing, which in this case, means not anything special. And it was towards the end of the buffet time, say about 1:45pm (closes at 2:30). There were two other parties seated. We were shown our table by a soft spoken gentleman, whom I believe took my sister and her cane into consideration and sat us closer to the buffet table. Nice.\\n\\nNow for the food. Not sure if there was soup during the buffet, but the pot was empty. I don't usually go for the soup and today was 90¬∞, but the pot was out there - but empty. Same for the onion pakora (there were only crumbs) and the veggie korma (there was a spoonful left, so I tried it). There was a dish labeled dahl, with paneer and veggies but no discernable dahl. Still good, though. Our man asked if we wanted naan and we said yes to garlic naan, but we were well into our second plates before he brought it. However, it was worth the wait, it was wonderful.\\n\\nThere were no less than five, count them, *five* chicken dishes:\\n\\n1. barbecue chicken\\n2. chicken briyani\\n3. chicken tika masala\\n4. chicken and potato curry\\n5. tandoori chicken\\n\\nI tried all but the tandoori chicken (why eat that while there are so many other flavorful options?), and they ran the gamut from standard (chicken tika) to excellent (the curry). But they were all chicken. As for the kheer (rice pudding), I was excited because that's my favorite dessert. And it *almost* hit the mark. The consistency was good, but was a little lacking in flavor (maybe needed cardamom). Dang! And I really wanted to like it. Of course, all food is subjective, and this is just my opinion. But I've eaten kheer at many, many places. Your mileage may vary.\\n\\nMy sister said this was the best Indian meal she had in a while. And I thought the food was good as well - not the best, but certainly far better than others we've tried. But here are my peeves. If you have a buffet, keep the dishes full or at least half full - even towards the end of the buffet. I wanted to try the pakora, and I'm sure it's one of the easier dishes to make. If there is no soup, don't make people open the pot to look - remove it. And for goodness sake, mix up the meat dishes and/or offer more veggie dishes. Overall, the number of dishes in the buffet were too few, and having half or more of them chicken dishes was a little disappointing. The cost was $10 for the buffet, which I think is a good deal.\\n\\nWould I go again? Sure! Would I go out of my way to go again? Maybe not, especially if I had better, closer options. But if you're near the downtown Wakefield area give it a try. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Delicious.

I knew it was going to be a fun place to have dinner since it's in Yaletown, even on a Monday evening. \\n\\nI instantly liked the vibe as soon as we walked in; great atmosphere, good looking servers, young and hip crowd, and a curious menu. Well.. I guess it wasn't that curious; it was more the way it was presented. \\n\\nAfter a round of yummy Hello Kitty's based on a Foursquare recommendation, we ordered the Kinoko Meshi (steamed rice bowl with mixed mushrooms and iwanori), the ebi mayo, the tako wasabi, the crab cakes, the crab tempura roll, and the tuna taco. I found everything to be quite tasty. The Kinoko Meshi was delivered and presented well. After we let it sit for 5 mins, the crunchiness of the rice mixed with the tender mushrooms was outstanding. The ebi mayo was coated in the sauce, and there wasn't really any mayo to dip in... but it was still good. The tako wasabi has some heat, but the seaweed counteracts the heat; an interesting but delicious mix. Great texture too. The crab cakes were ground nice and fine, and it wasn't too oily. That crab tempura roll is a mouthful; literally too huge to fit in 1 bite! But it was filling. My fave was the tuna taco. One tortilla rolled to imitate a large cone that's filled with the tuna in spicy mayo, tomatoes, and some minced seaweed. Superb, but messy. Well, that was a messy dish for me. My friend wasn't messy at all. \\n\\nFor dessert, we decided to try the cheesecake souffle. Not impressed with this one; I find that western desserts in asian restaurants don't usually turn out well, and vice versa. Unless of course it's some kinda fusion or the chef specializes in it. This was just too plain jane for me. Even with the coulis on the side; nothing spectacular.\\n\\nI must say that it was quite expensive; with all the food we ate, we both paid around $40, and that didn't include the gratuity. \\n\\nOverall I quite liked this place. A lot of people seems to have a problem with the service (or the lack thereof) but my friend and I had no problem at all. It was probably because it was a Monday. \\n\\nWould I come back? Yup!

In fact, I am willing to admit I've been there three times in the last week.  \\n\\nSomeone told me about this place several months ago and I finally got around to visiting the Short North location last Sunday.  Hands down, the biggest perk about Northstar Cafe to me is their vegan-friendliness.  It's so refreshing to be able to walk into a restaurant and order something vegan without having to go through the whole vegan \\"schpeal\\"... if you're a vegan you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about...  explaining that, no, vegan is not vegetarian.  Yes, chicken really is considered \\"meat\\" in my world.  And, really, I don't want cheese on the pizza.  \\n\\nAfter much deliberation, I chose the Bhudda Bowl.  DARN GOOD CHOICE.  Nice, fresh veggies, perfectly cooked brown rice, and the peanut sauce... out of this world.\\n\\nMy next two visits were to the Easton location.  I go to the gym at Easton, so it's nearly across the street (this is awesome and terrible all at the same time).  I ordered the Veggie Flatbread (no cheese! and no questions!  yea!) and the Square Meal, respectively.  The Flatbread was AH-MAZING, although I thought the sunflower seeds on it were a little weird.  The Square Meal was great too, but not as phenomenal as the Bhudda Bowl.  They also have great coffee and wine!\\n\\nSo, pros:  The vegan \\"thing\\", obviously.  I love having SEVERAL options at a restaurant rather than one or two -- at best -- or so many modifications to a reguar menu item that the chances of it coming out \\"right\\" are slim.\\n\\nGreat atmosphere at the Easton location.  I love the big windows and all the natural light during the day!  There's an equally terrific ambiance at night.\\n\\nFabulous service!\\n\\nCons:  It's a little pricy for, ahem, eating there multiple times during the week.  That said, I am willing to pay a little more for quality, organic ingredients, local produce, etc.  that are featured there.\\n\\nTheir coffee is great, but they only offer sugar and Splenda as sweeteners.  I would love to see some stevia.  It would also be fabulous if they offered almond milk in addition to soy milk.  \\n\\nThis place will definitely be a regular for me now.

You will see people strolling with these white cardboard boxes with Mike's written in blue on the top, and you will want to seek out your own.  It's easy to locate in the middle of Hanover street, and there seems to always be a crowd.  We walked by before dinner and the line was out the door, but after dinner it was only super crowded, and we got our order within 5-10 minutes.  What is unique about Mike's cannolis is that they offer about 10-12 different varieties including Irish cream, lemon cello, pistachio, caramel, etc.  We decided to go for several of them, and split in half so we could enjoy several.  They are quite good, some better than others depending on your taste.  We carried several home with us to our hotel fridge and had them the next two days, and they remained fresh and good tasting even a day or two later.

The bread they put their sandwiches on is out of this world and works perfectly with the meat.\\n\\nAs for the sides, the mac and cheese is sooo cheesey and good, the baked beans were Scorching hot but SO delicious with chunks of meat in them!

The portion was generous, a nice thick fillet, and the breading was crispy with only a very light flavor that didn't take away from my ability to taste the fish. I ordered a side of the spicy sausage as well, it was pretty good, although not really spicy at all (I do like spicy foods and have a fairly high tolerance for hot foods so not everyone may agree with this). Despite it's lack of spice it had a good flavor and was served sliced in a small bowl with butter, which was kinda different but I found I liked it. The staff was at least as friendly and attentive as last time. \\n\\nI hesitate to mention this because it might affect my ability to avoid the wait but watching the tables, there were none open on a Saturday night until 9pm. Before that you had to wait for one to become available, so if you don't like to wait you might try getting there a little after 9 on peak nights."},{"name":"Star Bar","address":"639 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Ewwwwww!

In the meantime, there were a few tables still occupied and some guests are casually walking towards the exit.  This staff then tells my friend that they should leave and wait outside.  My friend politely tells the staff that they'd rather wait for me there at the table.  To this, the staff threatened them and said that the cops are already on the way.  It is at this point that I got back and tried to defuse the tensions.  I convinced my friend to just walk out with me.  While exiting we see the 2 cops.  So this is how OASIS treats customers.

It took 20 minutes for the server to come back with the beer and take our food order. I asked for a glass of wine when we gave her our entree order. 25 minutes later she returned with nothing and asked if I already drank my wine. I informed her that I never received it.

Maybe I went wrong with ordering chilaquiles in the first place...I LOVE them, and probably have pretty high standards. Everyone makes home-made dishes differently, so I shouldn't really be surprised that I wasn't crazy about these ones. They weren't bad, they were just okay. My manmosa was amazing, but the waiter (unintentionally I'm sure) misled me when he said that they were oddly two dollars cheaper than a regular mimosa, and you get two. Once we got the bill, I realized he meant two dollars cheaper than ordering two regular sized mimosas. Not a big deal, but I probably wouldn't have spent more on my morning booze than my breakfast. The breakfast nachos were good, but heavy and a little too similar to those stuffed potato skins you find on pub menus. The coffee was good, but not amazing. We left full, but for a $40 breakfast we just felt...underwhelmed. \\n\\nAlso, I gotta admit I'm a little grossed out by the servers keeping the checks tucked into the back of their pants. I can see if there's a tucked in shirt between the leather book and their skin, but this wasn't the case for many of the servers, whose shirts weren't long enough to be tucked in. I really don't want sweaty waiter tush on my check, thank you. \\n\\nAll that said though, I'd probably go back just to give it another chance, maybe for lunch/dinner."},{"name":"New Ginza","address":"63-65 Galen St","city":"Watertown","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here about a year ago when I was in Boston, then went again a few weeks ago.

Toppings are an extra 50 cents charge. I got two mini cannolis - one with traditional ricotta and almonds topping and the second with vanilla custard and pistachios topping. Both were so good especially since with the mini size, you can  eat the shell and filling together. I find that with a bigger size, I usually only get mostly filling on the first bite. The only downside is that there's less flavor options at Modern so if you wish to go wild with another flavor, you would have to head over to Mike's instead. \\n\\nThe mini cannolis also have a mini box to go along with it and they tie up the box with red twine so you can take it to go.

Upon arrival there was no one at the podium, but it being a slow night (Tuesday) that doesn't phase me.  It took a few minutes for someone to come over and greet / seat us, I'd prefer that to be under a minute...something to work on. The interior is fairly sparse, with some fishing/ocean related items on the walls.  Lighting is only by 'can' lights in the ceiling so there is no real atmosphere created, and it was a  little bright for my taste. Tables and booths were above diner grade but not padded or in any way fancy.  Nice wood-details on the tables and chairs.  The bar area (which we didn't visit) has high tops, and the same wrap around bar as always existed there.  Music was generic pop music and didn't match the New Orleans theme, that would go a long way IMHO. Overall atmosphere is under-inspired.  The owners can easily remedy this.  \\n\\nThe menu may be a bit over-reaching as there are Appetizers, Entrees, Burger/Sandwiches and \\"The Boil\\" options. We were going to start with an appetizer and then maybe get some entrees, however the protein options for the boil were very good (Crawfish, Shrimp, four types of Crab, Mussels, Clams) and looking around quickly told us that the boil was the popular way to go (lots of stainless tins full of seafood coming out of the kitchen).  We also discovered that you (and everyone there was) ordering multiple items from the boil (sold by the pound) AND get a free pound of crawfish after 3 pounds... so that you can do a pound of Snow Crab, pound of shrimp and pound of blue crab and get a fourth pound of crawfish too.  \\nA little on ordering the boil: you have four choices of flavors, plus a three heat levels.  So you can order Butter and Garlic or Traditional, then the heat level (Mild, Medium, Hot) but the same blackening spice is used for all flavors, so it all winds up tasting the same if you add any heat...they could mix that up a little using hot sauces or red pepper flakes on the butter/garlic mix.\\n\\nService was a little spotty...took a while for the first round of drinks and for server to come back for the food order, and with two servers and only 5 tables that isn't quite right.  We didn't get bibs or (oddly) rubber gloves, other tables did (as a result I have a stained Henley).  I'm assuming this will work out with time.\\n\\nThe food was very fresh, tasted great (if not all the same) and was plenty for 2 people.  Be prepared to get messy, crawfish boil is normally messy, but add picking through crab and it is downright filthy (in a good way).  The boil comes with no sides, but that didn't stop us at all.  You could buy sides but don't, buy another pound of Crawfish for God's sake!.  \\n\\nNext time, maybe a pound of crawfish to start and then an entree each, just to test them out.

Sadly, I left with shattered expectations.\\n\\nThe location isn't the greatest as it is tucked away in the midst of a ton of office buildings. The surrounding streets were quite desolate when we were walking over on a Friday night (around 7pm-ish), and I probably wouldn't walk there alone in the nighttime.\\n\\nWhen my friends and I finally got to the restaurant, the place was packed to the brim, likely because Blue Dragon recently opened, and it's Ming Tsai. (P.S. I spotted him clearing tables in the place walking in. Squee!) Since we didn't want to wait 1+ hours for a table, we decided to try to squeeze into the bar for food, which we accomplished with 66.66% success. (As a sidenote, the crowd here appeared to be on the older side, I would say late 30s and over. Nothing wrong with that, but a note for people who may be looking to check out the bar scene here.)\\n\\nThe bartender (female) was not the most friendly or attentive. My friends and I (3 total) managed to snag 2 seats right in the center of the bar, and were completely ignored for probably 10 minutes or more. I mean the bartender purposefully tried to avoid eye contact even though she grabbed glasses from the service station in front of us to make other people's drinks. No \\"I'll get you in a minute\\" or anything.\\n\\nWhen she finally gets to us, we order some drinks and some food from the menu. Drinks were decent. I ordered a cocktail, but the name currently eludes me, and my friends got beer and a soda. For food, we got the dan dan noodles, pad thai, bison sliders, sweet and sour pork ribs and lamb shepherd's pie. While the food was good, it definitely was not good for the price, as the portions were extremely meager.\\n\\nFor $13, we got 2 super mini sliders that came with a few fries. There probably wasn't even a 1/4 lb of meat between the 2 of them. They were tasty, but not blow my socks off good. The sweet and sour ribs, at $9, were not particularly sweet or sour, and came with 2 mini ribs that had very little meat on them. The lamb shepherd's pie, $9, while flavorful, was dry. Except for the lamb shepherd's pie, due to the size of the portions, the small plates were quite difficult to share between 3 people.\\n\\nThe noodles for both noodle dishes were too al dente and had poor textures as a result, taking away from the flavors. My friend commented to me that the Dan Dan noodles would probably taste better the next day after she reheated them so the noodles would be more cooked through.\\n\\nThis was heartbreaker for me, as I've had Ming's food before and it was delicious, but my meal here was not particularly delicious or good value.

With the exterior appropriately crisp and buttery, the \\"almond butter cream\\" interior was more like a wet layer of artificially flavored paste that although sweet and tasty enough entirely bogged down the pastry.  Fairing better, perhaps due to lesser experience and expectation, was the Azuki Cream - another flaky croissant-style creation this time filled with mashed sweetened red beans and whipped cream.

It seemed people liked the place but there was no menu in sight. Feeling adventurous and ready for some laughs I hopped in to the car and raced over to Peachtree Hills. From the minute I pulled up I knew this place would be a fave. The space exudes an openess and warmth that is great for summer Sundays in Atlanta. Add to that the creative mix of available French toasts on the brunch menu and you're officially hooked. Our waitress was kind enough to recommend the Milk and Honey Iced Tea.. I wasnt all too thrilled seeing as though being borne and bred in Atl had not conditioned my taste buds to like iced tea.. .but from the first sip I was hooked. I cant tell you whats in it, why its different (you just have to try it!... trust me). \\n\\nHats off to the owners of this establishment, I will be a regular. The food, the prices, the tea and the atmosphere are all a plus. Thank you!"},{"name":"Blue Dragon","address":"324 A St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We went to Blue Dragon for my birthday.

Definitely try the Soy Pickled Deviled Egg with Taro nest. This was highly recommended by our waiter Jarrod and was so good we got a 2nd order. Try everything under Dim Sum you won't be sorry.

Hands down the best thing about coming here is the reasonably priced, always changing beer selection.  They feature lots of local brews, and they offer staff pick and create-your-own samplers so you can try them all. The food menu offers a large variety of typical American fare. The food is consistently good, but rarely great.  Both the meat and veggie burgers with any combination of toppings are solid choices and the quesadilla appetizer is hearty enough to be lunch or dinner by itself. I'd also recommend the Grilled Chicken and Couscous Salad.  \\n\\nI would give Cambridge Common more stars if it weren't for the service.  I've had a couple great servers, but I've also been at tables that have been neglected or abandoned.  As an example, a couple weeks ago, a friend and I never actually had a waiter assigned to our table that we knew about. We had to find someone to take our order, had someone else deliver our meal, and asked someone else to bring us the check.

They agreed so we went in. I wish now that we hadn't. I didn't see the prices until we got in: 12 to 12.50 for a milkshake. Which, okay, it's a tourist area so they're going to be more expensive than Steak 'n Shake, but I also expected that they'd be pretty decent quality as well; think like Ghirardelli at Disney. \\n\\nBoy were we mistaken \\n\\nAfter reading the menu, the milkshakes are all filled with extras: brownies, banana, berries, things like that. I decided to just have a plain chocolate milkshake. My aunt got plain vanilla and my mother got the chocolate banana brain freeze. \\n\\nAfter waiting 15 minutes to order, I ask the girl if they can add malt to my shake. She didn't know what malt was and had to ask--the answer being no. How does a milkshake place not have malt?!\\n\\nSo we waited again, about 15 more minutes to get our shakes. They were stupid busy and the area they made everything was disgusting; melted ice cream all over the counters and floors, employees putting sprinkles on half the counter and floor in addition to the finished shakes and sundaes. No one was bothering to clean and finished shakes and dishes were being placed in melted ice cream before being given to customers. \\n\\nWe finally get our shakes--in neat plastic cups shaped like mason jars that were sticky and covered with melted ice cream--and while the chocolate banana brain freeze was not only filled with banana bits it had both chocolate and vanilla \\"whipped cream\\"--I'll get to why this is in quotes later--chocolate sprinkles, a frozen chocolate covered banana, and a cherry on top. My aunt's and my shakes? NOTHING. \\n\\nWhen we asked why there was nothing on them we were told it's because they were plain and toppings were extra. \\n\\nSo for 50 cents more--mind you, these \\"plain\\" shakes were 12 bucks already--we could have gotten the monstrosity that my mother got, or the red velvet shake that had a whole freaking red velvet cupcake on top. But because we ordered plain shakes we didn't even get a cherry. And a full two inches at the top of the glass were empty...at least fill it up with more shake if you're not going to put any whipped cream in there. \\n\\nI didn't get to try my aunt's vanilla shake but she said it was good. My chocolate shake, however, tasted like the cheap chocolate you buy in five gallon tubs--for the same price we paid for the shake--that you get for kids parties because they're too stupid to know what good chocolate tastes like. Again, I was hoping that, for the money, it would be less dollar store and more Ghirardelli. \\n\\nMy mom mostly liked hers but, and this is where I get to the \\"whipped cream\\", it was ruined by the toppings. She was begging my aunt and me to eat some of the whipped cream because there was so much and because it tasted horrible. It had the consistency of toothpaste and tasted like there wasn't a single drop of milk or any dairy product in it--or sugar believe it or not. \\n\\nFor the money I'd rather buy a couple containers or Breyer's or even Publix Premium and make my own at home. Or, even better, hit up the aforementioned Steak 'n Shake for a far superior and cheaper milkshake. \\n\\nI'd like to try the restaurant in this place one day, but never again will I get any type of ice cream from them.

I called a little after 7pm.  I had to call twice because the first time (after over 20+ rings), I hung up because no one answered.  I thought maybe they were already closed.  I checked the hours on yelp and called back because they were open for almost 3 more hours.  The second time I called I just put my speaker phone on and let it ring until someone finally answered.  I was asked to hold (and patiently did) and when the order taker finally answered she sounded less than happy to be there.  I ordered the deluxe cheeseburger (fully dressed) and a side of fries.  I was told it would be ready in 20-25 minutes.  I arrived 20 minutes later and my order was ready (:  Nice!  I live three minutes away.  Get home and am ready to eat right away.  The fries are good-looking, thicker cut fries (yay) but were unsalted and cold /: (boo). I offered some to my boyfriend (not saying anything other than \\"would you like some fries?\\"). He eats one and comments, \\"they don't even taste like they're done.\\"  I agreed.  They were still slightly raw in the middles- almost all of them were not cooked thoroughly. (Double boo). I ate them because 1. I was starving and 2. its time to replenish groceries and my cupboards were bare!  The cheeseburger was a bit over cooked, but, fully dressed, I thought it still had a good flavor.  However, the bottom of the bun was so soggy (from the combined toppings?  maybe the shredded lettuce?) that I ended up using (and changing out) 4 paper towels!  I wrapped them around the burger just so I could eat it without it running down my hand and making a major mess everywhere else.  For the price, I doubt I will go back and, after my experience, I cannot say I recommend the deluxe cheeseburger and fries which is a bummer.

If you put Steak Tartar on the menu, I will order it. At first, when it came it was not nicely presented but don't judge a book by the cover. I will call this rustic French Steak Tartar presentation and not the fine dining version. It came out like a raw patty with a bunch of lettuce on top with some thicker bread slices on the side.

I am happy with it and will definitely order it again.\\n\\nThe Sweet Bread was slightly disappointing, we were used to it being pan fried, their version is breaded and seasoned like a nugget and deep fried served with a lime vinegar.

I sorta want to give it three but I just can't justify it. The chips and salsa were so-so, the food was overpriced, the drinks were weak, and the service was pretty bad. It's too bad really since it has a *great* location, overlooking the lake from high above. But it is what it is and, after scanning some other Yelp reviews after the fact, it seems I'm not alone.\\n\\nI went with a decent sized group after work - about 14 people total. We'd actually intended to to the place next door - an \\"uncle\\" BBQ place (out of respect, I'll leave the name out of this review) - but they were closed on a Tuesday with new \\"winter\\" hours. *snaps fingers* Dern it. Ah well, the whole area is beautiful and clearly intended to dazzle. In fact, I took pictures of the courtyard area just outside The Oasis as it was just beautiful and lush, filled with interested areas.\\n\\nAnd then we went in, walking past a grand staircase and a really cute bar area with wicker chairs that just beckoned for you to sit, relax, sip margaritas and talk with friends. The place wasn't that busy so we got a nice table outside, with views overlooking the lake. Gorgeous!\\n\\nAnd so that's all the good stuff.\\n\\nI'll skip to the particulars of what I didn't like about The Oasis as, no matter how well you tell a bad story, it's still a bad story. Ours started with an extremely long/delayed drink ordering process. We were assigned one waiter, but he had helpers, and yet it was a good 30 minutes from when we sat down until they started asking for orders. It was at this 30 minute mark that we also got the chips and salsa. The chips were wonderful but the salsa just so-so. It wasn't spicy nor that flavorful and so the baskets went largely untouched beyond bored nibbles. This is a \\"gourmet\\" Mexican restaurant (my word, not theirs) which specializes in pricey tex-mex and a few token sandwich choices. It was another 30-40 minutes until the food came out. I had the Tilapia del Mar - blackened tilapia with shrimp and scallions in a lobster sauce. It was ok, but small. I finished my $18 meal quickly and began nibbling the chips some more, waiting for the waiter (again) to ask for a refill. You know it's bad when the talk around the table switches from the beautiful view to lack of flavor in the meal, and then worse - \\"has anyone seen the waiter in awhile.\\" And so it went.\\n\\nNow I don't normally look at my watch too much while dining out. But I will mention this last part because it will emphasis the slowness of the service. At around 7:20 my friend asked me for the time. We were sharing a car on this trip and we were trying to get to Best Buy before they closed at 9pm - \\"Ah, it's 7:20. Plenty of time.\\" Or so I thought. We were done eating, you see. We were waiting for the waiter to return so we could ask for the check. It took someone going inside about 15 minutes later to get him to come out. He informed us that policy was to not split the tab - so we all dug out cash or cards and divy'd things up. It wasn't bad and it only took us 5 minutes or so. Oddly, we all watched, somewhat entertained and yet also mystified, as the waiter took it all inside and stood in front of the cash register computer for a good 7 or 8 minutes. \\"What could be taking him so long - enter the cash total, and ring up the amounts on the 6 credit cards.\\" That was, after all, exactly what he'd recommend we do. \\"Happens all the time\\" he said. And so around 8:15 we finally got our cards back and began exiting the restaurant. In case you were curious, we *did* make it to Best Buy with 4 minutes to spare.

ElAzteca and Meehan's get old, but getting a sitter could add 50% to the cost of the meal, which isn't sustainable every weekend. So in my never ending search to find good places, new places, where we can take the kid, I wound up at BrickTops at the Terminus building in Buckhead last night. BrickTops had assured me that kids are welcome at the restaurant, and to their credit, they have a special kid's menu and even an \\"etch-a-sketch\\" type device for kids to draw on. Actually, this was a nice touch. Baby Steakhead had a grand ole time. I wish I could say the adults did.\\n\\nBrickTops is a new chain started by the founders of Houston's. There are currently 4 locations, all in the Southeast. You can definitely tell the Houston's influence on the menu, which is to say relatively simple meat and fish offerings. We wound up sharing a couple of appetizers- the chips and guacamole and the smoked salmon flatbread. The flatbread, with warm cream cheese, capers and dill, was cut into individual squares, and only a small dap of salmon adorned each square. For $15, they could have been more generous.\\n\\nFor her entre, Lady Steakhead went with a cup of the soup of the day, which on a Friday is Lobster Bisque. This had a much stronger tomato taste than a lobster taste. Given I just came back from three days in Boston where I had chowder (or chow-duh as the locals would say) every night, I found this to be disappointing. Same thing can be said for my crab cake entre, just not a lot of seafood taste. There was plenty of crabmeat in it, so I wonder about the quality of the crab they are using.\\n\\nThe clientele at BrickTops was noticeably older. I saw many tables where at least one person was over 60. The interior is pretty bland, and as my wife accurately pointed out, it sort of looked like a diner inside. The bar seemed to do decent business, so maybe this will be more of a lunch/happy hour place. For dinner, they seemed to be caught in restaurant \\"no man's land\\". We had three appetizers, one entre and 2 glasses of wine, and the total tab was almost $120. For that kind of change, I would have rather spent a little more, gotten the sitter and gone to Chops or Rathbun's and had a nice leisurely evening. Or conversely, I could have gone to Outback and spent half this much, with just about the same quality. And had a Bloomin' Onion to boot!\\n\\nBut all is not lost for the Terminus complex in Buckhead. Lola, a Here to Serve Restaurant, is now open. I stopped in after dinner last night, and the place was hopping  (and it looks like it may be possible to take kids there-it's certainly noisy enough that you would never hear them). MF Sushi is also opening a Buckhead location at this complex, and Aquaknox, a concept from Las Vegas, looks to open soon. If you can navigate the parking situation, which at the moment is a complete disaster with all the construction, this may become a popular destination for Buckhead dining.\\n\\nSteakhead Recommends: No\\nPrices: $$$"},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Cheap, super delicious Indian food.

They text you when your table is ready, so go be an adult and walk around and wait! \\n\\nSo, upon being told it would be that long to wait, we decided to go on over to NBC Sports Grill & Brew, (another great place at Citywalk) grabbed some drinks, appetizers and saved room for the dessert that awaited us at Toothsome.  \\n\\nOur server was Lauren (from PA) and she was just a delight to have.  Prompt service with a smile and incredible menu knowledge!  I tried to throw her off by asking odd questions on the menu and she was able to answer my annoying questions.  She was just an all around joy to have at the table and she was very welcoming.  Very friendly, accommodating and gave us smiles throughout the evening.\\n\\nWe did order \\"Tatchos\\" which are tater tot nachos... Caution, this might cause you to lose your mind, so delish!  We also ordered their chocolate almond bread appetizer... this is something unlike anything I have ever had.  Imagine Outback Steakhouse's brown bread that they bring out to you, only, dessert like with way more flavor, more delicious and somehow the consistency of a cake, muffin, and bread all mixed together.  Sounds interesting, it is!  In the best way, because this was so good.\\n\\nWe ordered the Red Velvet Milkshake, the Heavenly Hazelnut milkshake, and my mom got the killer chocolate sundae with brownies and chocolate and it's pretty much how any woman would want to die I'd imagine.  Thankfully we were able to pull my mom away from her plate and restrain her before she consumed all of the chocolate!\\n\\nTheming - CHECK\\nAtmosphere - CHECK\\nAmazing food - CHECK\\nPrompt, friendly, wonderful service - CHECK\\nCreative menu options - CHECK\\nEntertaining environment - CHECK\\n\\nCheck please....

We were not disappointed. Valet parking was validated, which adds to the elegant and rich experience. Tables were spaced for privacy, with comfy oversized chairs. I didn't feel rushed, it was as if they expect you to stay and talk the whole time. They were initially pushy with the alcohol, which got annoying after the fifth time asking if we wanted champagne. There were 12 teas to choose from, and our four selections were all delicious and brewed perfectly. There was every sweetener you could imagine for your tea. The food was plentiful, mainly baked goods. The scones were amazing, with a selection of clotted cream, lemon curd, and jams to complement. The finger sandwiches were obviously made the day before as the bread was stale, which was a tad disappointing, but the finger deserts were delicious. I read a review that this tea didn't constitute a meal, which is true, but I had skipped lunch and was full by the time I was done. I think the $40 was well worth the price of the tea, as I was paying for the elegant experience and time with friends as much as the food and drink.

We brought everyone in a few hours before we were supposed to be there and they were totally cool with it. \\n\\nThe decor in the restaurant is really nice, so we didn't have to worry about that aspect of planning a wedding. We brought in some centerpieces that I made, and the staff put out little candles on some of the high tables, and otherwise the place was wedding-ready! The owner's wife even made beautiful bouquets for me and my bridesmaids!\\n\\nWe did a cocktail hour with passed hors d'oeuvres and a buffet dinner and all of it was so good. Our guests loved the meal. We intended to spend the cocktail hour hanging out with our friends and family, but we had to do some extra photos, so the waiters made us a plate of apps so we wouldn't miss them. We also weren't able to eat dinner (people warned us this would happen at our wedding!) so they made us a huge to-go package to take with us at the end of the night. Yummm. \\n\\nEveryone had a lot of fun at our wedding. They loved that there were couches to hang out on, they loved the decor of the restaurant, and they were impressed with the staff. All of the waiters and bartenders were awesome!\\n\\nIf you're having a small wedding (80 people or less) and want to do it in Boston, this is a fun and economical place to do it. The staff is really relaxed, so if you're more of a high-maintenance person, you may not get what you want here. But if you're hoping for a fun, non-stuffy wedding, you'll love it here.

It sort of tucked away in an underpopulated area with not too much else around. However, when you walk into Blue Dragon the atmosphere is vibrant and casual, yet trendy. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I sat at a small table next to some other guests, but did not feel tucked in like sardines. Our server greeted us right away and was friendly and extremely knowledgeable. He had a lot of recommendations on the menu and it was clear he had thoroughly sampled the dishes. What I liked most about the menu was the variety of proteins and vegetables. Not only were the ingredients exotic, but so seemed to be the preparations as well. Also, the dishes are smaller plates that are meant to be shared, this way we got to sample many interesting dishes. \\n\\nSome of the items we tried were the short rib spring rolls, the bison sliders, duck confit, and ginger sauerkrout keilbasa. Everything was really delicious, but the short rib spring rolls stuck out for me. It was a very delicate balance of asian flavors with quite a substantial meat. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend blue dragon for a casual, yet nice, evening out.

They open at 11 am and I got there by 11:30 am. The place was decently packed. The line grew longer around 12 pm, due to all the businesses around the North Market going on lunch.

Some of the best chicken I have ever had. The mac & cheese was a great compliment to the chicken. The portions are huge, so be prepared to be full for the rest of the day. When you get a meal, you get your choice of chicken, mac & cheese, coleslaw, pickle slices, and two pieces of white bread.

I know what you're thinking- seriously, how hard can it be to put meat and cheese on a platter? The reason you choose the charcuterie at Rockmill is because they know what they're doing! There are three different types of cheeses that sort of explode in your mouth, with big multidimensional flavor. There are four meats, some delicious grainy mustard, several large bean sized pieces of dark chocolate (need I say more), these amazingly delicious pickled vegetables, and some toasted thin slices of artisanal bread. Yum yum! \\n\\nWe moved on to splitting the chicken sandwich- also worthy of the hype! The daily fish special was poached in a miso-like broth and was very light but flavorful. \\n\\nI almost forgot about the trout appetizer- also light yet with big flavor. This may have been a special since I don't see it on the menu. \\n\\nMy sis had a flight of Rockmill beers and we all thought the Pilsner was stellar, even though I wouldn't typically order a Pilsner.

It's hard as a rock. Their best quality food is probably their desserts. The custard bun has a very delicious cream that's not too sweet. They're also very generous with the amount of custard they put in it, but I guess for $1.80 a piece, they should be (a custard bun from a Chinatown bakery is less than $1). Their spicy tuna onigiris are always very delicious. I guess there were complaints before that they didn't put enough filling and had too much rice, so they put up a sign that says more filling. HIP HIP HOORAY! For around $2-$3, it's a steal. Everything else in the restaurant is pretty pricey. \\n\\nOh and if you're gonna buy a bottled drink from them. Just walk down the block and go to super 88 for the bottled asian drinks or Shaws for the Nantucket Nectars beforehand rather than paying the steep premium they charge. \\n\\nI also like that they have free wireless, but they could use more outlets around the place since it seemed to have become such a study spot for students around here. There's only one outlet downstairs and maybe two upstairs, where they have less tables. I would also prefer slightly brighter lights for studying. \\n\\nOh and please work on making your bathroom cleaner looking. Every time I walk in, it has a distinct smell and the toilet itself is pretty disgusting. I've seen stains that I didn't want to see. People say that the best way to judge how clean a place that serves food is is by looking at their bathroom!\\n\\nI sound like I have a lot of complaints about this place, but I do really think it has a lot of potential. I've always been a huge fan of the other Japonaise bakeries, especially the one in Porter Square. But for me, as a cafe, it's left a lot to be desired."},{"name":"Amnesia Brewing","address":"832 N Beech St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"A good local brewery.

However, 15 minutes into our seating, it started to get packed. \\n\\nFood:\\n1. Salmon hash - do not get it, Yelpers don't lie. Its dry and the potatoes aren't crispy. The sauce, leeks, salmon and potatoes don't mesh - it lacks cohesion. My over easy eggs helped to blend them together, but still was not ideal. If you just want to try it out, I suggest the half order, so you're only half disappointed (that's what I did).\\n2. French Toast - the challah stays nice and moist and the corn flakes add a nice additional sweetness and crunch. The accompanying maple syrup is delightful. Its best to dip it so the bread doesn't get overly soggy.\\n3. Biscuits and gravy - the biscuits are dense, yet flaky. The gravy is rich and savory - they've done a great job at adding sausage bits and building a nice roux that doesn't have any taste of flour bombs. Compared to Pine State - its about par, except I'll take the biscuits at PS any day.\\n\\nI'd say this place is overhyped, and if there's a line, its not worth it.

The range has different colored targets  varying by size and distance and your goal is to hit them (at least in one of the game modes). There are various other game settings you can choose. You can keep track of your scores by purchasing a $5 lifetime membership. You'll get a card, which you swipe at the bay to keep record. The building itself has 3 levels of bays and each has a bar with nice seating areas you can have a drink or a bite while you wait for your bay to be available. There are no reservations for this place... it is all first come first serve, which can be rough if the wait is 3+ hours long.

Davie Street must be one of the most competitive areas in Vancouver for a restaurant, and with two well-established Thai food restaurants already in prime locations on Davie Street, I figured Thai Basil wouldn't be around very long, what with it being situated off Davie, and kind of out of sight. \\n\\nI decided to give them six months to try and survive before I would try out their food. And much to my surprise, Thai Basil survived the first six months, and I soon figured out why. \\n\\nFood: Typical Thai dishes are offered. You can get your green/red/yellow curried chicken/beef/pork/tofu; you can find Pad Thai and fried rices on the menu; you can get spring rolls, satay, fish cakes and soups; and of course you can get the curry combos. (see menu for details: http://www.thaibasilvancouver.ca/menu/) \\n\\nWhat won me over, however, was the overall flavour and consistency of taste. The food is always well-prepared and I know what I'm going to get. The curries usually have a spicy kick to them which is well-received since some Thai restaurants seem to shy away from to appease the sensitive western palates. \\n\\nI usually go for the dinner combo which comes with a curry, salad, rice and spring rolls, all for less than $10. \\n\\nWord of advice: avoid the dipping sauce that comes for the spring rolls -- it's not good at all, and I really hope they replace it with a nice plum sauce or something similar. \\n\\nService: As other reviewers have noted, service is a bit lacking, but there always seems to be a trade-off between product, price and service. While I have not experience any major issues, I have had to wait a little longer than I would like to be served and receive my food, and some of the counter staff have bordered on being rude. But I could tell that their English was not strong and they seemed to be newcomers to Canada, so I tried to cut them some slack. It's not easy adapting to a new language and culture. \\n\\nEnvironment: Not that they can doing anything about it, but the place is pretty small and cramped. But it's clean, the decore is pleasant, and there are one or two nice pieces of art to look at. I hope that as Thai Basil becomes more profitable they can expand the restaurant. \\n\\nPrice: Combined with the food, this is the best feature of Thai Basil. Where else can you get a tasty, filling and comforting meal for less than $10 incl. tax? \\n\\nI've gone to Thai Basil a couple times a month since 2008, and will definitely continue to go when I need a quick, cheap, Thai meal."},{"name":"Menya Ramen","address":"331 W Bridge St","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Soup was OK but Noodle was way over cooked today.

I was organizing a kick off dinner for a capital campaign for our church.  We were on our way to raise $700,000. for repairs on our building.  We are a pretty liberal church in Somerville. \\n     At first meeting J.B was welcoming and accommodating.  He made everything sound pretty straight forward and easy.  We thought this place would be great.  I called the next day to confirm we did want the space.  The lounge area was fun and there would be plenty of room to dance.  I asked him when we pick the menu, he said to call back in late May for a June event. I called and then went there at the end of May.  He would not make himself available. He told me to come back. Fine.  I went back the Wed before our event on Sunday.  He seemed like we were putting him out.  The Celtics were in the playoffs so he asked if we could end our event earlier. Of course we could not just end our formal event earlier, so we said no. Plans had been made. But he wanted us out to make more money on that Sunday than he previously thought he would be able to.\\n     The next day J.B called me and told me I made a mistake and that we could not have the lounge, we would have to take the small dinning room in the back.  When I didn't agree he began to verbally assault me on the phone, even claiming that this was not the place to have a \\"religious thing\\": and \\"praying\\". Our minister was going to say a pray over the meal.  It was not to be a church service.\\n     After having to go over his head to the owner, and calling around to see if we could have our event somewhere else we were finally told we could have that space.  I made him put it in writing.\\n    The staff the night of the event were wonderful and helpful, and the man Tony was very helpful. However, when it came to desert they only brought out coffee and tea no desert.  I explained we ordered it but Tony said that J.B didn't put it in the order.  \\n    When I got home and looked at the contract we did pay for desert.  So not only did it cause so much stress and headache to have it there but they stole $350.00 by not providing us with a service we paid for.  \\n    If you don't want to get hosed by a place choose some where else.

They did have drink specials which is always good. \\n\\nNot that Star Bar had anything to do with the fact that I wasn't paying for anything, it certainly made my visit more enjoyable. \\n\\nLastly, I had heard from different people that Star Bar had pretty good bar food, considering.

A few of the servers have a more nonchalant attitude, and thus overlook details like offering first timers free bubble tea & refilling soy sauce containers.\\nAs for environment, with colorscape of greens and neutral beige (which complement the juice bar VERY WELL), it is very modern and clean looking.\\nNow, for the main focus, which is where most of the hit and misses are. I've tried quite a few things so far.\\nTHE SUSHI: Bagel roll & OMG are better(& more afforable with discounts) than their neighbor restaurants like miso izakaya, BUT the wasabi is very poorly grinded up.\\nWINGS: So far, I've tried the honey garlic, teriyaki garlic, and buffalo. Out of all three the honey garlic is definately the best. The teriyaki garlic at first bite is good, but then it starts getting too salty.\\nBENTO HUTS: I've tried their chicken teriyaki and grilled shrimp teriyaki. The sauce tastes good, but the meat in both have a bad aftertaste that's really hard to describe... kind of like bad quality chicken/shrimp?\\nThis place has REALLY GOOD CRAB RANGOONS AND the fried shrimp that came with the teriyaki bento box was delicious as well. \\nSPICY BEEF SOUP: gahh. I got this because the reviews say it is amazing and blah blah, BUT this had the biggest disappointments. To be honest, it was really hard to eat because the soup was watery and sweet.The description says that it is supposed to be like spicy korean beef soup, but the sweetness really throws it off course. \\nSPICY BEEF RAMEN: The ramen was decent. The noodles were like regular ramen noodles, but again the soup was very watery and not flavorful.\\nThe best things here are the wings, sushi(some), and CRAB RANGOONS. \\nThis plave has a lot of potential and although this may seem critical I really want this restaurant to do well, so I'm just providing feedback to help it become one of the best.

The first time I got my drink it tasted like plain juice; the waiter took care of that issue.\\n\\nThe cheese enchiladas were pretty good.  For the tacos, I tried to explain that we wanted everything on them, except they should substitute beans for meat.  So he sort of did that...  However, instead of using the refried beans, they used like plain boiled kidney beans.  That made the tacos pretty flavorless.  The veggie fajitas were quite good - nice flavor and they came with pico, sour cream, guac, etc.  Here again, we asked for more tortillas and it took forever to get them.\\n\\nLastly, the prices at Senor Frogs are super high.  For this meal with two adults and two kids, we paid $70+.  They also included a 15% gratuity on the check.

It is such a fantastic place to have a business meeting.  Our meeting was in the meeting room on the third floor.  When I arrived, there was an Oasis employee standing in the parking lot near the door, and as I approached the door, he asked if  I was there for the meeting.  I responded that I was, and he directed me to the entrance, and said I could take the stairs or the elevator and the meeting was on the third floor.  That was a fantastic way to greet guests!\\n\\nThe meeting room was fabulous.  We had a great sound system as the speakers were using microphones.  The speakers probably didn't need them, but the sound was good.  One really cool aspect is that the microphone was even projected in the bathroom!  I loved that.\\n\\nWe had a really great meal.  It was chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I loved every bit of it.  The staff was great at unobtrusively serving everyone during the presentation.

Do you plan on going there when people eat meals? If yes, then make a reservation.\\n\\nWe went on a Saturday night because my friend was leaving on an epic Asian Adventure. I had been eyeing this place for forever, but never had the chance to go. I make curry from a paste at home and my parents act like I've set them on fire. Not for them. This place was bu-say! Stuffed to the gills full of people with a lineup crowding their itty bitty foyer. \\n\\nPitcher of pop please... my friend ordered it in anticipation I would want some. I am not a fan of fountain pop, but I drink it because people do nice things for you. It tasted like RC Cola. Like the pop at Foody Goody (raise your hand if you remember that place) or Grand Buffet. $5.25 and it yielded like seven glasses. \\n\\nWe ordered the Wings (I'm sure they have a name, but I am just gonna go with Wings), Green Lettuce Fried Rice with Chicken and Shrimp, and Tangerine Chicken. Our server asked if we were okay with spicy. Sure, why not. And thus our wait for Indian influenced Chinese food began.\\n\\nIt wasn't that long... the food came pretty quick. We had ordered two orders of the wings... there were about twelve pieces. The best part about them was the garlic paste smeared all over. These were good and spicy. I'm not sure if they're deep fried. I would guess they're baked... if they were fried, the sauce got rid of the crispiness.\\n\\nI was kind of expecting there to be green lettuce in the fried rice. I guess I was having a duh moment. No lettuce in the fried rice. It was pretty spicy. I didn't expect that either... how many chili peppers were there? It was typical fried rice with a kick. I love ordering fried rice because I can't make it like this at home. \\n\\nThe tangerine chicken was a little spicy... or maybe a lot, I dunno because I am chugging water (which is wrong) at the same time. The pieces of chicken were deep fried in batter and smothered in sauce. I don't normally like stuff like this, but my husband who loves lemon chicken insisted. Fine fine. We polished it off...\\n\\nDo we want dessert? Who can resist a deep fried banana with ice cream? And they have pineapple too...We asked how big the desserts are in case sharing was a possibility... Our busser replied, not big. So I got my own. So glad I did... it was like a mini banana and a ring of pineapple with two scoops of ice cream. It makes me wanna break out my deep fryer. It was so small... and there was no way that was honey sauce on my deep fried goodness dessert.\\n\\nI thought the food was good, but if I didn't have the common sense to make a reso, I wouldn't be waiting in that extra long line to eat."},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4015 Townsfair Way","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Great place to meet a friend or go alone.

Of course I turned to Yelp and looked for something Asian. This place came up on the map and the reviews looked pretty good so I thought I would give it a shot. I have to say that this is probably one of the most authentic Asian restaurants I've ever eaten at. As a pescatarian and I am often limited by menu choices however they had a section on the menu specifically for vegan diners and they also had a nice selection of seafood options. I opted for the vegetarian fresh rolls and the bun vermicelli salad with grilled shrimp. What makes eating here kind of fun is that the waitress brings your meal  out on this rickety little rolling cart also if you want anything added to your meal you better have a menu in front of you because basically you have to order by pointing at what you want. I added a salty limeade to go with my meal. I have to say that everything was absolutely phenomenal, everything was fresh the sauces were amazing and flavorful and if you have not tried the salty limeade along with your meal here the sweet saltiness goes perfectly with the spiciness of the food. As I was leaving I made the decision to cross something off of my food bucket list. Anyone who knows Asian food knows what durian fruit is. It has the reputation for smelling bad and tasting worse. I noticed that they had a variety of smoothies available, one of these being made with Durion. The waitress told me that the fruit is frozen so it doesn't have the smell that the fresh fruit does. She brought it out to me in a Styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw.  I took it out to my car as I didn't want to pull a face in front of her in case it was as bad as I had heard. I lifted the lid and took a whiff, it smelled like ass faint ass but still ass. I would describe the taste as if someone decided to make a smoothie out of vidalia onions with a lot of sugar. It definitely had a creamy custard texture but the flavor was definitely oniony and it left an oniony aftertaste. This is absolutely no reflection on the restaurant at all, it is just my reaction to a food that acceptable in another part of the world but my taste buds are not acclimated to it.  My next trip to Columbus I will definitely come back here."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This review is 100% based on service.

Last night, we started out with the super tasty duck sopes) and the chile relleno (loved the escabeche!), and then had the tacos, the duck breast, and the Wagyu. The duck breast was definitely the star of the night! Perfectly seasoned and cooked in every way. The beef was delicious too and the stars on the taco plate were the black beans and the vegetable taco.

So we will definitely be back regularly and happily, especially with Pauli behind the bar. \\n\\nHere are a few minor tweaks...nothing that would keep me away though... The music was blasting a high energy party mix, and I would have liked something a bit mellower for a lovely meal like this. We booked through Open Table and the first available was 8:45 pm. When we got there at 8:30, half the tables were empty, so something with the reservation system is not quite working yet. Maybe call to confirm? In terms of food, we didn't get the combo of porcini and chimichurri. Maybe try huitlacoche instead or offer one or the other but not both? The rice on the taco plate was under-seasoned and lukewarm. Also, the pork and the lengua on the other tacos were tasty but too soft. They could have used a minute of crisping under a broiler before serving and a slaw that was a bit brighter/more acidic and cut smaller like on street tacos. Or what about a few leaves of culantro- yes the one with a u?

Our waitress took our order all at once, and everything came out as it should, with plenty of time to eat our apps before our main course. Also, despite our larger table and the restaurant being pretty busy when we arrived, or main dishes didn't take very long at all. \\n\\nThere were a couple people complaining of the music on here and I don't know why.

It can be a little hard to browse through everything while ordering, especially when the lines get long, so I suggest having 1 person look while 1 stands in line or hanging back and looking prior to getting in line.

Maybe it's just because of weird fridge on one side or maybe it's because it always seems to be empty (then again I've only been there for dinner), but it's just not quite the fun and happy place that I've come to know Clover as.

Out of all the donut places we tried, Pip's hands down was both of our favourites! \\n\\nUpon entering Pip's on a Wednesday at 10am, there was virtually no line. Not sure if this place gets as long of a line as other donut places like voodoo donut, but I'm not complaining. The cashier was also extremely helpful in helping us decide what we should get. We both ordered a dozen donuts to ourselves. My friend, who isn't really a chai tea person, got the Adult Hot Chocolate -- for those who want to know, the cashier told is that the adult hot chocolate uses drinking chocolate?, while the kids uses chocolate syrup and has marshmallows. \\n\\nI ordered the chai tea flight (the Emmy Lou was personally my favourite. I loved the hint of lavender!) and two of each flavour donut which included:\\n- Cinnamon Sugar\\n- Raw Honey & Sea Salt\\n- Nutella & Sea Salt\\n- Candied Bacon Maple\\n- the Dirty Wu\\n- Blueberry Wild Rose\\nI could probably write a review for each donut because they were all so good!

I like two things: hot chocolate and donuts. And Pip's hits both of these out of the park. \\n\\nGood hot chocolate is a rare thing. Pip's isn't cheap - $3.50 for 6 ounces - but the flavor is fantastic, and it's rich enough that I wouldn't actually want a larger serving. It really brightens an otherwise gray Portland morning. I haven't tried the Mexican chocolate yet, but the other flavors are excellent. As an added plus, it gives you something to dip your donuts in. \\n\\nOn that note, I also give them top marks for the donuts. Pip's makes little donuts, which they described as being beignet style. They've got a great process that leaves them just slightly crisp on the outside and warm and soft inside. Donuts come with cinnamon sugar or a honey-sea salt glaze; at first I was a little dubious about a salted donut, but the salt is very light and it's a great flavor. \\n\\nBeyond that: the atmosphere is great and the people are friendly.

Since the restaurant is situated on a cliff there were so many ups and downs and tight curves to get there, and many of the cars on the opposite side were coming over the line driving crazy around there. Once we got to the restaurant I thought the atmosphere was great, it was perfect weather and the environment was lively (full of people). On this particular night there were about 3 separate events so we waited about 1hr and 10 minutes for a table. In the mean time we had margaritas, walked around and watched the sunset on the lake. \\nOnce seated, we didn't have the best waiter, he only paid attention to one particular table that ordered a lot of drinks and the rest of his tables he'd stop by maybe 2 times depending on what you asked for. I had beef enchiladas, rice and beans and my girlfriend had the combo chicken and beef fajitas. You also get an Oasis souvenir cup!

My favorite is the Oreo Cake. =) or a Lobster claw. =) Everything is awesome.

I've had a lot of dim sum in my lifetime, and I'd say this was pretty average. They had most of the classic dishes, and they were no better nor worse than your standard dim sum restaurant. The main issue was that nothing really stood out, and I don't think I'd go back for any particular dish.\\n\\nThe best dish was the black bean spareribs, which were meatier than the ones I've had elsewhere. The best dessert was the pumpkin glutinous rice with bean paste. Everything else was relatively unmemorable. The char siu bao were disappointing in the amount of roast pork filling, and I thought the rice rolls with shrimp needed more shrimp. Each roll only had about one medium-sized shrimp each, which meant it was particularly hard to split them. I waited and waited for the har gow (my favorite), but they never came around. \\n\\nSpeaking of waiting, I would have given this place four stars if not for the long wait times between carts. When we first sat down at 11am, we were bombarded by carts. But halfway through our meal, around 11:30, there were no carts at all on our side of the room. We looked around and everyone was just sitting there waiting. This continued for half an hour. I finally got tired of waiting and went to the steam table in the front that I didn't notice before, and just picked the items that I really wanted. Unfortunately, some of these items were cold, particularly the egg tarts, which weren't warm or flaky enough.

My mother and grandma were visiting from Phoenix and it was our first get together since they had gotten into town. They had to leave early for an appointment so the rest of our party sat and ate as they got ready to leave. My mom asked for a to go box and a little extra sauerkraut for her Rueben. She explained that she had asked for/payed more for extra sauerkraut on her sandwich but she didn't think they put any on. I immediately became uneasy because my mom always has some sort of issue when we dine out. She's just one of those people and my family has had to learn to accept it. The girl said \\"Sure!\\" and walked away to retrieve her items. A few moments later, another employee came up and said \\"Hey ma'am. That's gonna be $.75 extra.\\" My stomach dropped as I knew this was not going to go well. My mother explained that she had already paid extra and didn't receive it, so she didn't think she should have to pay for more. The employee told her that they put twice as much as usual on her sandwich and she did get what she paid for. My mother said \\"Well, it really didn't seem like it. It must just be a little bland then. That's okay! I don't need extra.\\" The employee walked away with an unpleasant face. I was embarrassed about this at the time, but after reading other reviews I realize other people also agree the Reuben is bland! \\nSo here's where things got crazy. The rest of my family left and it was just my boyfriend and I enjoying our sandwiches. As soon as the door closed behind my family, the owner walked up to the young employee and they IMMEDIATELY began frustratingly conversing and pointing towards my family out the door. A wave of unforeseen rage washed over me as I watched the OWNER and his young employee crap talking my mom right behind the counter. I raised my voice to defend my family from my table, \\"Uh Uh Uh, NO. I'm sorry to speak out like this but you can not just stand behind the counter and s***-talk my mom in front of everyone. What are y'all thinking?! Take it to the back.\\" They froze in embarrassment and walked away. I was stunned...at them, at myself for speaking out. I tried to finish the rest of my meal but just felt so, so awkward. I walked up to the counter to get a to-go box and the young girl grabbed one for me. When she handed it over I said \\"Look. I understand. I worked in the service industry and customers like my mom were my least favorite, BUT I took my frustrations out in the back...Not right in front of members of their party.\\" She said something apologetic but I got distracted by the owner walking over. I asked him \\"Are you the owner?\\" Cause I was still doubting that the owner of a restaurant could do something sooo stupid in front of his customers. He said yes so I asked him what he was thinking displaying his frustrations in front of everyone. He waved his hand in my face, \\"I wasn't talking about her I was talking about another customer.\\" I laughed and said \\"Really? You're going to lie to me and admit you were crap talking a customer? Doesn't matter who it was, it's still WRONG.\\" He continued to deny he was talking about my mom, pacing behind the counter, muttering angrily, and then finally he said \\"Look, if she wants to come in here and shit talk my food and want free food etc than she can go f*** herself\\" I was aghast that this grown man was first, lying, and then, angrily CURSING in my face. I explained to them that not only had she NEVER been there before, but she also didn't want a free meal, she wanted a side of sauerkraut. The young girl interrupted my sentence to tell me that she in fact had been in before and caused the same problem. I explained to them again that this was her first time coming to the restaurant and they must have her mistaken for someone else. This is where things get blurry in my memory because the conversation moved so quickly. He kept saying things like \\"If you don't like my food then get the f*** out\\" I explained to him that I was not his problem. We loved the food and I was just looking out for them. I explained I was not really mad about the incident at first, because I understand how troublesome my mother could be, and that I only said something so they could watch their actions in the future. BUT after the owner repeatedly yelled and cursed in my face, telling me to get the f*** out, I WAS LIVID. I am a 21 year-old women who handled the situation very calmly despite have a huge, 35+ year-old man, hostile-y yelling and waving about in my face. I left the restaurant completely shaken up and confused. \\nThanks, Sebastien, for a very memorable experience at your restaurant!

I was visiting Portland and Mother's Bistro was my very first stop after I landed. Luckily for my boyfriend and I, the wait was only 15 minutes :)\\n\\nImmediately after being seated, we both noticed the decor. We loved the personal touches that were added to the restaurant! As for the food, we definitely had a hard time deciding what to order because of the extensive menu. During breakfast/brunch, there are several popular items that you could get a half order of if you want something smaller than the regular portion. I decided to get the half order of the salmon hash (because I saw everyone on Yelp get it). My boyfriend ordered the reuben sandwich, and we also split a half order of the french toast. Everything that we got was delicious! My boyfriend even said that it was the best reuben sandwich he had ever had! The sandwich had a good portion of meat, and had just the perfect amount of crunch. I also really enjoyed my salmon hash. It was very flavorful, and the potatoes really hit the spot! I definitely recommend both the reuben sandwich and the salmon hash.\\n\\nIn addition to the great food, the service was also amazing! Everyone was friendly, personable, and attentive. All in all, I very much enjoyed my experience.

I was provided with a modern southwestern style room on the 14th-floor room facing downtown across the river.   Nice touches include a door bell that the room occupant can set to do-not-disturb.  A large flat screen TV (tho no HD TV).  And a fine iPod docking clock radio.\\n\\nElsewhere, the lobby bar is nice enough--in a 80's kind of way.  Restaurant food was good (for breakfast anyway), though a bit pricey especially for Austin ($14 for omelet).  \\n\\nThere's one downside worth mentioning.  Although this is downtown, its not situated like a city hotel, like one in York or San Fran.  A walk downtown requires a 5-minute trek through parking and empty lots without sidewalks to the corner  Barton Springs or Congress Ave and unnecessary block farther away from the bridge downtown."},{"name":"Who's Got Soul Southern Cafe","address":"3818 Covington Hwy","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"I read the yelp reviews and honestly my hopes were too high for what I got.

The Chicken Chimichanga is delicious in a lightly fried tortilla, filled with seasoned shredded chicken.  Add a dollop of their great white queso and it is delicious.  Plenty for 2 meals.  The rice and beans are flavorful, but actually nothing very special.  The guacamole is a big hit with the rest of my family (personally, not a fan of the avocado ever).  The flan was simply a dream!

The employees were very helpful and friendly and I was able to get my beer and wifi. The outside of the place looks like a typical retail commercial coffee house, but the inside is much more unique and comfortable. I did not eat anything there so I have no rating for the food, sorry. Music over the speakers was cool with a lot of variation that I appreciated.

We ordered Old Fashioneds and although it took a while to place our order and even longer to get our drinks, they were pretty good. I'm kind of an Old Fashioned snob, so I guess that's saying a lot?\\n\\nWe got our food before our drinks. That always blows, especially after a long day at work. I ordered the wild boar ribs off the happy hour menu for $14. Well who knew boars had such teeny tiny little bones with barely there meat on them?! I'm not sure what their process of serving this dish is, but they came out so quickly I feel like they must have just thrown them in a microwave? I don't know. The sauce was delicious, sweet and spicy, but the meat was very tough and dry. I was disappointed. I was glaring with envy at my friend's brisket sandwich and she was generous enough to give me a quarter of it. I have to say, I was equally unimpressed. \\n\\nThe condiments were far and away the highlight of the meal. They are so cute served in different size bottles and the mustard-y sauce was exceptional! It took everything in my power not to steal those bottles. I could probably drink them by the spoonful. After making a huge pool of dipping sauce on my plate I was able to finish my mountainous tower of ribs. \\n\\nWas this an amazing experience at Lambert's? No. Will I give it another shot? Eventually. I definitely would get there early enough to snag a bar seat and it is extremely convenient for ACL Theater and the parking garage right there so... hopefully my next experience will be a little better."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],E={key:0},L={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,N)):w("",!0)])}const R=u(H,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-eeb6a9ee"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/62.md","filePath":"people/62.md"}'),G={name:"people/62.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(R)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
