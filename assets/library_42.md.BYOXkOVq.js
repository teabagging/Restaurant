None of us had visited before but had heard good reviews through the grapevine.   \\n\\nFirst off, let me say that the service here is superior.  The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing, regularly checked in with us to see if we wanted/needed anything, and always made sure we had at least two bottles of water on the table.  That last bit's impressive because we literally stayed late and shut the place down.  It's nice to be in a place where your'e not rushed out and served up until the crickets are chirping.\\n\\nThe drinks were pretty good too.  They have carafes and bottles of house wine.  Nothing exceptional, but pretty good for $4 glass and $9 a caraffe.  Nicer bottles of Italian reds were also available.  They also have three local beers on draft (Amnesia, Laurelhurst, and one other I can't remember).\\n\\nNow for the pizza.  Dang it was good.  Our margarita had a nice crust that was firm but not too thin.  I'm of a charred thin crust guy, but my wife and another party member really like this \\"in-between\\" size of the crust.  Regardless, it had real depth of flavor.   The ingredients were restrained and it made for a good, simple bite.  My only recommendation would be to use more traditional balls of mozzarella rather than the shredded stuff.  Another party member would add more oregano to the sauce.  Our second pizza was The House that came with nice sausage and arugula on top. This crust was a little more pliable, and I think it could have used more time in the oven.  Still, quite tasty and I like the contrast of fresh greens on top of a hot pizza.\\n\\nIf there's a downside to the place, I'd say it was the noise level.

We each received a menu and we decided to do three omikase.  \\n\\nWe got our first two dishes which were all the same for the whole table and then it got a bit weird.  The next round we got two dishes and then waited on the third one but they were different.  It was quite confusing.   Wasn't sure if we got a different dish by mistake or what was going on.  It took awhile to flag down a server and then get some clarity that we were supposed to get different dishes.  The server said it was that way if we wanted to share and try a little of the other dishes.  Huh?  Then the remaining dishes were all identical.  I enjoyed most of the dishes but my favorites from that meal was the blondie shot dessert, chicken liver pate (the fingerling potatoes that came with this dish was cooked perfectly), the chicken,and the pork and beans. The plating was beautiful each round.\\n\\nI love supporting local and especially labor of loves from the artist/chef.  I just wished we were able to get more details on our dishes that came out.

We waited around 45 minutes to eat... on a Saturday, it wasn't too upsetting, but still quite a while.\\n\\nThe Bartender that night was really good, but paying almost 5 dollars for a bud light seems a bit much to pay in Somerville, I mean this place isn't even located in Davis or Harvard Square.\\n\\nThe food, was indeed very good, but $16 for fish and chips?????  I a sorry, but they only give one large piece of fried fish and it seems like an awful lot of money to pay even if it was good.

It was hard to have a real conversation because you were so close to the surrounding tables all you could hear is them talking instead.  \\n\\nI would go back if someone else wanted to try it, but I would stick with the cheapest thing on the menu, which I can guarantee you, is still overpriced."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"1605 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This review is for the vegan curry and roti set, and the rice salad. Roti is vegetarian and the rice salad contains shrimp, only the curry is vegan in this order.\\n\\nI'm not sure if this was an off day at Hat Yai, but the rice salad was super one-dimensional. Rice salad is usually one of my favorite dishes but this one just tasted of sugar. I used the full amount of chili flake and lime but everything got lost in the sweet sauce. Couldn't taste any of the accoutrements, even the vegetables, just sugar.  Basically inedible and didn't have more than a few bites.\\n\\nUnfortunately the vegan curry wasn't a lot better. It had much more flavor than the salad, but also really heavy on the sugar. Compared to other Malay style Thai curries in town, it is 30-50% sweeter. Very rich, very deep allium and spice flavors, but masked by sweetness. The pickles barely helped. I also couldn't finish it.\\n\\nRoti was your usual delicious fried roti. There's better out there but this was delicious still and no complaints.\\n\\nIn contrast to my experience, my dining partner's standard Hat Yai curry gravy was delicious. Well balanced, complex, spicy. Really good. \\n\\nTL;DR: Save your money if you're coming as a vegetarian/vegan diner. It doesn't feel like they put the same energy and finesse into the vegan curry at all. And as for the rice salad, seems like it is hit or miss. Other people describe theirs (aromatic, complex, refreshing) as completely different from mine (boring, intensely sweet)."},{"name":"Pizza Days","address":"111 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"2","text":"Truly, I would never think of reviewing a restaurant.

I ordered 3 Pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Breads  without actually looking at them.

The flatware tosses back to the 80's with the freshness, and the serving size is more than adequate.\\n\\nLove the service (sweet, familial, engaged) and you don't need to be lucky to have Maurizio himself swing by your table, present with a joke or a handshake.

This is an all-you-can-eat buffet so, you will be compromising quality for quantity and cost. Please be aware of the following:\\n- Food: Average. We got appetizers (shumai and chicken wings). The appetizers were greasy and meh. Then, we ordered two different types of sushi rolls. They were blah. You can find the same at any pre-packed sushi at a grocery store (except for the sushi sold at Whole Foods).\\n- Waiting time: Don't go there if you have a limited time for your lunch break especially, on a Friday. The wait to be seated and then to get your food is excessively long. It took over 40 minutes only to get us the food. They are way under-staff.\\n- Customer Sevice: This is the main reason for why I'm giving this business 1 star. Our waitress and the manager Cindy obviously never received any training in customer service. But the one that showed the less respect and courtesy was the manager Cindy. When my boyfriend approached her to express his concern about the lengthy wait she harshly replied that we can cancel our order and leave...Basically \\"f%# off!\\". It's not only what she said but the way she handled this situation. I was upset for the way she treated us. No respect and understanding of why customers get frustrated. She definitely needs to get more training or get fired. I asked her for the name of the owner because I'm planning to call him and complain directly to him about his staff. \\n\\nSorry for lengthy review but I hope this helps you decide about this business.

I thought that was strange, and so was the food. \\n\\nI've heard from others that they have a good selection of quality margaritas, but a recent experience at Painted Burro has made this place kind of obsolete for me.

The menu isn't that of a typical BBQ joint. While the aroma from the real oak smoker might seem typical enough, it's what happens after the meats are smoked that makes PF unique. They have taken the flavors of traditional BBQ & combined them with non traditional flavors, like the Butter Chicken Tacos, featuring grilled chicken blended with sauce from Indian Makhani chicken, not at all buttery. Served on a tortilla, garnished with cilantro & pumpkin seeds, it was a delicious bargain at $2.70.  We also had the Barbakoa Ban Mi, ($7) with tender moist grilled pulled meat on a roll that was similar to well made brioche. Like traditional ban mi, it was garnished with cucumber & carrots that had been lightly pickeled, giving the sandwich nice texture & a hit of acid & sweetness. We also tried the Big Floyd ($9) a 3 meat monster sandwich. The grilled brisket, pork & ? were tender & lean, cooked perfectly, garnished with more vegetables, jalepenos & french fries, served on a bun that reminded me of Portuguese sweet bread or brioche. The sides were good, too. We had grilled corn on the cob, 5 stars there, and beans & rice, all really good. And the beer & wine list sounded great, with prices starting at $4, but we didn't imbibe.\\n\\nThe menu is truly inspired, changing often, with many other very interesting options, but you can only eat so much in a day. We found the portions large enough to need to go boxes. Looking forward to returning to try Pigs their other offerings. \\n\\nPig Floyds is surrounded by many really interesting highly rated restaurants, diners cafes breweries, wineries, etc. The area is like a freaking theme park for funky food & drink. I wish we could have tried more, but again, you can only eat so much each day. However, I really love where this neighborhood is going for the most part. Lots of awesome little quirky places, and then that big honking ugly boxy building at Mills / Nebraska.  Hands down, its the creative dining epicenter of central Florida / Orlando area.

I was okay with this, as I had just run a half marathon and was ready to eat anything. I chose 3 drumsticks with a side of \\"frim fram\\" sauce to go - late night snack. I asked what frim fram sauce was - it's basically a mix of ketchup and mayonnaise with a little extra tang. It wasn't my favorite, but the fried chicken was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly battered and had just the right amount of savory spices. It was super crispy and the meat was well cooked. \\n\\nThe only thing I picked a bone with (pun fully intended) was the fact that they advertise as selling 100% natural Georgia chicken. These are all buzz words - the chicken is probably factory farmed. According to the National Chicken Council, Natural (verbatim from website) means: Under USDA regulations, a \\"natural\\" product has no artificial ingredients, coloring ingredients, or chemical preservatives, and is minimally processed, just enough to get it ready to be cooked. Most ready-to-cook chicken can be labeled \\"natural,\\" if processors choose to do so. \\n\\nEgg-sactly. So quit the misleading advertising and we will be okay.

Unfortunately the nachos themselves didn't live up to the description. Not enough chips for the toppings, and way too much juice in the bottom of the dish, so that more than half the chips were getting mushy in Soggsville. The pulled pork didn't taste like it had any kind of flavoring on it, and other toppings were few and far between. The only thing luxe about them was the price tag at close to $20. \\n\\nMy friends also didn't love their brisket, it was kind of fatty and the sides were small and heaped underneath the meat. \\n\\nThe music gets 5 stars because the sound system wasn't too overpowering on any instrument, something even a layman such as I can sense, especially with jazz.

One thing to note is that you must pay for the chips and salsa- not a big deal to me but some are taken aback by this.  One complaint would be the portions.  The chips come in a small bowl which our four top polished off in mere minutes, and the salsa comes in small, stainless silver bowls, about 1/4 - 1/2 cup in size.  They do offer a salsa sampler, four salsas and the chips that would be adequate, but the one order of salsa verde was so inadequate, we needed another very shortly after its arrival.  Charge me, but don't make me have to order 3 bowls.  The guacamole was great although suffers the same problem of small portions.  As far as other appetizer selections, I have heard others rave about the roasted corn and there are a few other appetizer options that I recall being a fairly diverse selection.\\n\\nWe washed our appetizers down with some margaritas which were prepared well- no complaints there!  They currently only do buy-the-glass so there is no pitcher option.\\n\\nFor entrees, they basically offer quesadillas and tacos, with your choice of chicken, carne asada, brisket, and at least a couple other choices that escape me.  They also offer a selection of other entrees, such as fish, but we opted for the tacos and quesadillas.\\n\\nI ordered the carne asada quesadilla and brisket taco.  That sounds like an awful lot of food, however in keeping with our appetizers, the portions are fairly small since their menu is a la carte.  The prices are also in keeping with the portions provided.  The quesadilla was good, however I would have preferred more cheese.  There was enough carne asada to get that flavor (which is very good) but there didn't seem to be enough cheese going on for it to be a true quesadilla.  Due to this, it was slightly dry overall, but still quite good.  The brisket taco was GREAT!  Some seriously good brisket is going on there.  The accompanying cabbage adds a bit of crunchiness, as well as the radish garnish (had to pass on that- not a fan).\\n\\nOur total bill for our four-top was about $90, which included five margaritas.  A fair price overall.\\n\\nI give them a break on the portion issue, as the owner is going for an authentic taqueria (minus the flies) which offers good selection, but small portions.  In this vain, he has succeeded, however certain items (i.e. salsa) really should be given more thought on portion size.

We visited on the Thursday night, and it wasn't crowded and service was fast.  You order at the counter and then grab a table to wait for your meal.  I was hungry, but decided on ordering only two tacos.  It turned out to be a good choice as two was more than enough.  There is a large selection of beer, especially different types of cider that I haven't seen before.  I didn't partake, but definitely would if I visit again.\\n\\nThe two tacos I ordered were the Pork Belly Taco and the La Vaca TahKaw.  I was really excited for the pork belly, and it was good, but it didn't blow me out of the water like I expected.  Its more of an Asian inspired taco, with their Dragon Sauce which gives a peanut/teriyaki flavor.  The pork belly is more of an aftertaste than a flavor driver.  It was good to try, but it wouldn't be my first choice again.  The La Vaca TahKaw, however, was ah-mazing.  The brisket was flavorful, but the real champion is the lettuce-tomato-cheese combo.  That paired with the meat and rice is a winning combo.  If I return (and based on how good it was, I intend to) I will have a hard time ordering something other than that.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the butter chicken taco, which I thought sounded good except it was marked on the menu as a spicy option.

Was greeted immediately at the door by the manager. He was so friendly and welcoming. Our server was not very friendly at all. Quite rude and made it very clear to us that if we wanted separate bills that it will be incorrect when we get it and it will be very difficult for him. Hmm strange. \\n\\n\\nOur private room was so hot that our butter melted. I asked the server several times if he could do anything. He opened the front door of the restaurant and said he couldn't do anything about it.\\nThe assistants who brought out our food were so friendly, funny and accommodating. The pepper guy even took it upon himself to turn on the AC for us. Wow! Now I guess it wasn't so hard.\\n\\nThe food overall was okay. Not really worth the $35-$60/entree. \\n\\nWhen the bill came, the server refused to separate the bill. He even went as far to say that it is impossible to even split up the seat numbers and subtotals for the single bill. Very strange because I am familiar with the system they use and I KNOW it can be done if he rang in the items properly from the beginning. He was so rude that he started arguing with us. Wow! \\n\\nI went to fetch the manager who was so kind and friendly. He made the server correct the issue. I guess the server was mad at us right when we walked in. He was so rude he even would wave his hand to get my attention rather than use his words like \\"excuse me\\". \\n\\nFor the amount of money you spend for food that is just okay, I am insulted to be treated like this.

Time wasted. Pig Floyd's is a welcome addition to the food scene in Mills 50.\\n\\nI dined at the Pig a few weeks ago on a Saturday night before seeing a movie in Winter Park Village with a few others. For a Saturday at dinner time, I was surprised it wasn't more crowded. The line was short and we were able to order right away, thought it took quite a while to decide what I wanted. Everything sounded so amazing! I decided on the Chicken Al Pastor and Shrimp and Sausage tacos, and just told myself I'd return very soon to try everything else.\\n\\nWe found a table outside. The weather was actually pretty mild for a summer evening in Florida. Sitting out on the patio under the string lights was very relaxing. When the food arrived we were in heaven. Those tacos were just incredible. Such unique flavoring. I would have never thought to put those flavors together in a taco, but man did it work. Also, the plantains were so tasty and cooked to perfection. The other's in my group ordered The Big Floyd and Plain Jane Barbakoa, and they both loved their meals as well. The only complaint we had was the lack of BBQ sauce. There really wasn't enough on the sandwiches and none was provided at the table. In my opinion, if you're going to have a BBQ joint, you can't skimp on the sauces.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm a big fan of Pig Floyd's and I will absolutely return to try their other dishes. A great option for a casual dinner with great food.\\n\\nUpdate 6/23/2017: I returned for the first time in a while and tried the Kimcheeze taco. Wow!

All I had remembered the menu is HUGE and the cheesecake is tasty. \\n\\nWe were going to get Mexican, but it was 5pm and the height of rush hour.. we sat for 15-20 minutes and didn't even get barely a mile. We were both in the \\"I'm too hungry to talk to you, be nice to you, or not scream in traffic\\" kind of mood, so we pulled into the mall, thinking we'd just walk around and get something from the cafeteria.. and then we walked towards Cheesecake Factory, because of where we parked, and we decided to give it a go.\\n\\nWe were sat pretty quickly. I noticed it was in the middle of happy hour and waited a few minutes for drinks and bread. One lady walked by and dropped off some bread, some rye? pumpernickel? with oats?  I don't know, but it's good.  I think it's the same as O-u-t-b-a-c-k bread actually.\\n\\nAN-Y-way, We ordered about 10 minutes in.. we finished our bread and almost our drinks..  and before I knew it, we had been sitting there for over 40 minutes and still no food, no bread refill. The table that showed up after us, was getting their food. I was sure they didn't order before us.. I was about to get angry, when our food was placed in front of us.\\n\\nHe got a turkey avocado sandwich, which he inhaled, with sweet potato fries.. which we brought home. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, which besides sounding like a fancy-as-$#@! name, is delicious. Crispy baked chicken on top of basil pasta with a bit of a buttery creamy sauce, with prosciutto and arugula and parmesan cheese on top of that.  The first bite was delicious.. and then then next and the next and the next.. and soon I realized how RICH and savory it really was, and decided to box up over half of the plate to bring home. \\n\\nThe waitress came back by and we asked for the check and a piece of the Adam's chocolately peanut buttery fudge ripple cheesecake to go.  We ate it later at home and it did not disappoint.\\n\\nOverall, if the food sucked, this place would be a 1 or 2 star experience, because tonight's service was not impressive.  However, we both really enjoyed our meals, so there's your saving grace. After all, the actual food can have an impact on how you feel about a restaurant.. sometimes. We have a bunch of food leftover, and I'm not sure if I'd go back necessarily, unless someone specifically requested it, or it was the only thing open, but 3 stars for this experience.

Both are worthy.  The diablo sauce is a spicy red sauce with a smoky flavor that likely is made with chipotle chiles.  Refried beans are good with a dollop of white cheese on top.

I got sweet tea as my drink and being from the south I definitely have a motto of \\"the sweeter, the better.\\" The sweet tea here is fair at best. I ordered the salsa chicken quesadillas, which were super good. I normally like queso with my quesadillas so I asked for a bit of queso with it. Expecting for our waiter to say it was going to charge, he instead asked to substitute the queso with the normal rice & beans. I accepted and didn't regret my decision. The quesadillas were really good, as was the queso.

The flavor of these slices is incredible. I like that they don't overload the pizza with a ton of ingredients...it's all well-balanced. They also served up a free roasted jalape√±o, which I appreciated, though I think some of the hot juice got soaked on my kid's slices which ended up burning his lips a little.

Lulu was our waitress and she seemed passionate about the restaurant, kissing and hugging everyone in my group on our way out as if we'd known each other for years.  The atmosphere was alright, but the place was  practically empty on a Friday night at 7:30.

My husband loves the sandwiches, usually leaning towards the pork belly banh-mi. When he's feeling crazy, he'll change it up and get a different sandwich. I married a wild man.\\n\\nLet's not forget about their beer selection. Even after drinking at one of the local bars, I still can't resist grabbing a beer here.

I took my fiance here for our five-year anniversary because I knew he wanted to learn more about using fresh herbs and making sauces. He's a vegetarian who hates mushrooms, so most of the cooking classes I found in the area would have been disappointing. By opting to create a private couple's class with Mark, we were able to enjoy a menu that was perfectly suited to our tastes and learning goals while getting lots of individual attention and being able to enjoy each other's company. The three of us worked together more like old friends than a teacher with students. Mark was so warm and so willing to answer any questions we had, from the chemical properties and techniques necessary to achieve proper textures in the food to the finer nuances and merits of his kitchen gadgets, to ways to adapt the recipes and techniques to our own stock of tools at home. He was simply a joy to work with. The class was expensive, but the food, company, and information he shared with us were more than worth it. We were so pleased that we sent him a fat tip on top of the price of the class. \\n\\nWe made: \\nWild Rice & Tomato Bisque with saffron-infused Greek yogurt \\n- This was so simple and so amazingly good! The yogurt added the perfect extra touch of tanginess. \\n\\nCaramelized Onion Tart with a Warm Arugula Salad with a shallot and balsamic vinaigrette reduction dressing and a Cucumber and Greek yogurt dip \\n- I wasn't moved by the cucumber dip, but the arugula salad was lovely. The dressing we made was excellent and was the lynch pin in a long-awaited detente between my fiance (upholder of creamy dressings) and I (lover of oil and vinegar). The real highlight for me was the tart - by far my favorite item of the night. I was so excited to make my very first from-scratch crust, especially when it came out so perfectly buttery and flaky. I will definitely be making this soon, as well as many variations on the theme. \\n\\nPotato Gnocchi with a Pesto Cream Sauce \\n- When I say that my fiance loves gnocchi and pesto, please understand that I mean it in the way a six-year old would love Halloween, Christmas, and his birthday all rolled into one and covered with sprinkles. It's a serious relationship that has led to serious taste-testing on his part. This was the best gnocchi and pesto he has ever tasted. EVER. They were perfect white clouds of divinity that dissolved effortlessly in the mouth like soft pillows of fluff covered in sparkles and rainbows. When I ate that first bite of gnocchi, I felt as though I was entering some intense form of zen meditation that bordered on nirvana. The best part was that we made them! My fiance has decided to make the gnocchi again for a party we're going to this weekend. He's even insisted on adding a gnocchi board to our wedding registry. I'm not complaining! \\n\\nLavender and Honey Gelato with Pecan Shortbread \\n- For something so surprisingly easy to make, this dish had a big impact. It was wonderfully smooth and light, creating a perfect counterpoint to the heavier dishes before it. Unfortunately, gelato does require an ice cream machine to get the right texture, so we probably won't be repeating this one any time soon, but I'm still thrilled we got to try this. Ice cream making is no longer intimidating, I've learned the virtues of essential oils (impressive results with very little quantity), and I've found a new go-to recipe for cookies that lends itself to endless variations. That shortbread will be appearing in my kitchen at the holidays for certain. \\n\\nPros: lots of individual attention; relaxed and calming atmosphere in a really amazing space; Mark is warm, approachable, incredibly eager to please, and great at giving instructions; the food is beyond delicious, mostly organic/free-range/local, and always fresh; really cool kitchen gadgets plus explanations for how to get by without them / find them for cheaper; two cute cats to keep you company; copies of the recipes to take home; menus are totally customizable if you do a private class; no cleanup; you can ask any question, no matter how small or complex, and get a clear answer without feeling embarrassed; you don't have to know how to do everything already \\n\\nPro/Con depending on your perspective: it's BYOB - this was a huge pro for us since we don't drink; we didn't get to bring home the leftovers - I'm pretty sure we could have if we'd brought tupperware. You should ask about this; the class was really long - we should have set an earlier start time; Mark sits with you while you eat - you get to hear his cool stories, but you don't get romantic couple time \\n\\nCon: expensive - but totally worth the $; building a little hard to find - but amazing when you do (artists' association); portions too big to enjoy each dish fully - use self-control and bring tupperware! \\n\\nOverall - Just GO! Great for private parties, and I bet his set classes are just as amazing.

In any case, I put my name in for a table and after a 20 minute wait was able to get in to the bar. We had a round of drinks at the bar before being finally seated.\\n\\nMy friends and I were hoping to get some appetizers later and savor it with a few more rounds of drinks. But to our dismay, we were told that when seated, customers are expected to get full dinner service. So no apps and drinks, we have to order entrees. So in a nutshell, as a customer, you do not have any discretion over the quantity of food you want to eat. In addition, we felt a nasty judgmental vibe when we asked if they can serve Vodka with \\"RED BULL.\\" So apparently, we get judged when we ask for drinks of our choice. \\n\\nI gave this a 3 star b/c I liked it when I went there for the first time, and had a totally different experience.

I was skeptical to say the least, as I have been to many Mexican restaurants in Canada claiming to be authentic and tasty, and all have fallen short.  To prove me wrong, my friend took me to Taqueria Jalisco. After the visit, I am pleased to say I found the one ethnic food type I felt wasn't possible to get in Canada. If you thought good Mexican food wasn't able to be found in the lower mainland, or perhaps BC, then I am happy to inform you you'd be wrong as Taqueria Jalisco exists.\\n\\nIn the heart of Surrey, most people would casually pass by this wonderful restaurant, as it has a very small front facing the street in an older building. However, there is a large sign though to try and entice you in.  I lived in California for two years and had some great Mexican food. Many of the best places were tiny, family run places that were packed to the gills with food items and other items for sale while also being painted in bright neon and pastel colors. Taquerio Jalisco fits this description to a tee.  As soon as I entered through the door, my brain was filled with fond memories of many great times in Mexican restaurants in the Bay area. \\n\\nSitting down at one of the 8 tables, you can take in all the sights the shop has to offer: hand made pinatas hanging form the ceiling for sale, the shelves of in-house dried chilli peppers for sale, the displays of different treats and sauces from Mexico also for sale, soccer on the small television commentated in Spanish, and much more.  Within a minute, the one server came over, greeted us and gave us menus.  The menu is straight forward with only about 1-2 dozen items, with many being the same type of item but with slightly different ingredients (i.e. shredded beef, spicy chicken, pork, and steak for tacos).  As we were reading the menus, the server came over and delicately placed a plate of fresh tortilla chips and 3 different in-house made salsas (one red hot, one red mild and one mid-heat green) for us to munch on for free while we were deciding what to order.  \\n\\nIn traditional fashion, the tacos severed at Taqueria Jalisco are smallish (only ~4 inches in diameter), but are filled with flavourful meats, spices and veggies.  With this said, they are only $2 each which gives you a lot of filling.  As a result, they provide 2 tortillas to either divide the filling into two tacos or to aid in the structural integrity of the taco by adding taco wall support.  I ordered 4 tacos, all with different meat types.  With the chips and salsa to start and the 4 tacos, I was stuffed.  My friend also had 3 different tacos and an order of the nachos, and my fiancee had a quesadilla.  Between the 3 of us sharing, were were not able to finish all the food.  Also, none of the dishes we ordered (including the nachos) were super fatty or greasy.  My fiancee was ecstatic with how much chicken there was in her quesadilla with a good amount of cheese (but not too much cheese to be too much).\\n\\nBy this point, you've probably deduced the food here is not even close to what is served at \\"Mexican fast-food\\" restaurants.  However, with that said, Taqueria Jalisco is authentic tasting Mexican food that is very affordable.  For all three of us, having enough food to fill us, plus drinks and tip was less than $40 (and we tipped well since we got great service and portions).  For about the same price as a fast food chain, you can get fresh, real good tasting Mexican food.  Personally, I don't know why you'd settle for a Mexican fast food alternative if you were in the area. \\n\\nAlthough Taqueria Jalisco is not in the most luxurous part of town, I would certainly not hesitate to recommend for you to check it out.  This is a place I would go out of my way to get to for a Mexican food fix.  North of the 49th parallel, this is THE BEST Mexican food I have had and will be going back as often as needed/wanted :)\\n\\nPS If you want to try some tasty Mexican pop, try one of the many types of Jarritos they have chilled and ready to serve."},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you like pork and eggs, you and Toast's menu are going to be great friends.  As a non-beef/pork eater, I had hoped for a chicken sausage option, or something to rival the protein powerhouses that were on my friends' plates.  At any rate, there are lots of lovely homemade touches on the menu--buttery, delicate biscuits as layered as a deck of cards, flavorful homemade berry jam, peppery garden greens.  Beware, there are no pancakes on the menu.\\n\\nService was a bit slow (we waited for over 45 minutes for our breakfast when others seated after us were served and cleared before us).  We arrived at 9am on a weekend and had no trouble getting our party of 4 seated right away."},{"name":"Graffiti Junktion Clermont","address":"2400 S Hwy 27","city":"Clermont","stars":"3","text":"Since I moved to Clermont I have been trying to scope out new place per weekend as to locate the pulse (and decent vegetarian food) in this sleepy little town. I showed up at Graffiti Junction one Saturday night and was sorely disappointed. After walking through the doors and being bombarded by loud country music (because cowboys and graffiti go so well together) and hostile stares from the locals, I was told to sit \\"anywhere you like\\". Unfortunately the only place to sit was outside on the patio next to a bunch of smokers with a breathtaking view of Buffalo Wild Wings. \\n\\nI ordered the veggie wrap and potato salad. Service was slow and uncomfortably talkative. The wrap itself was a weird cheese log with tortilla around it and the potato salad had copious amounts of meat in it (which was not specified either on the menu or by the waitress even after I explained I'm veggie). Altogether it was not worth the money or time to eat here."},{"name":"Olga's Kafe","address":"99 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Coffee tasted like old sewer water with a flavor of something resembling coffee.

One thing I do know, is that Austin is a bored city or just can't get enough of craft beer.  As Katie T mentioned, we were part of the 1000 plus suckers which arrived around 3pm.  Who would of thunk it?  \\n\\nThe afternoon consisted of lines...everywhere.  Negotiating Fitzhugh Road to the brewery took a little over 30 mins.  We were following the guidelines posted on their website by carpooling otherwise, we would of bolted right there and then.  However, we had some guests with us who were meeting folks...etc..Once parked, we made our way to the masses standing around the 8000 sq foot barn.  These were the beer tasting lines.  Went to purchase the pint glasses.. they were out of them.  Made the mistake of buying the snifters for $10 each.. didn't realize there was another option of a plastic cup for $5, which would of been the far better choice.  We didn't realize that the next event, waiting in line, was going to be an epic journey.\\n\\nLot's of unhappy line waiting campers for sure.  Here is where better organization would of worked a treat.  Countless folks walked down between the lines, hung out at the beer table, grabbed beers and then made their way back out.  Most of them had pint glasses, filled to the top.  It was at this point I looked at my little snifter glass realizing this was a full on beer drinking event, not a tasting event at all.  A max capacity vessel was the way to go.  It felt like I had brought a thimble of water to put out a barn fire.  It was the selfish individuals who cut into the lines which created the wait to take so long... it's a shame that people are that arrogant to be so disrespectful of the folks who even haven't had the opportunity to get a beer yet. After 40 mins, we arrived at the moment of truth!  Beer!  Glorious Beer!.. well no, not really.  Our particular table only had the Black Metal Stout or the Wytchmaker IPA... so much for having a taste of their beers.  Suz got the Stout and me the IPA.\\n\\nWe cruised out of the chaos which was the barn and quickly checked out the brewery and the classic cars.  The owners of which were packing up and splitting.  It definitely was the best plan.  Getting back in line for another 40 mins (a guess since the lines were definitely now longer) for a spit of beer in a snifter, certainly wasn't in the offing, so we did the same.\\n\\nEventually we made it back onto Fitzhugh to head out, passed the entrance which now had an Event Closed sign on it.  That didn't deter folks parking on the side of the road and making their way in.  It was now 5.30pm.  The event was suppose to go to 9pm.  It was a great disappointment.\\n\\nSince it was such an ordeal to even get to taste one of their products, it's a bit of a challenge to rate the beer.  However, the brewery does sit on a nice piece of property and has a really nice feel to it.  I would be hard pressed to head out to an event at the brewery again, since they do have loads of challenges to accommodate the populous which shows up.  I'm just glad I didn't have to hit the bathroom.  I look forward to trying their beers around town when I see one for sale in order to get a proper idea of what hops and barley taste like in the Jester King kinda of way."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"After eating here for the first time last weekend, Tasty & Sons has easily become one of my favorite PDX breakfast spots.

My coworker and I had escargot and stuffed mushrooms for starters. The escargot was great with plenty of garlic and butter which added a nice deep flavor to the snails. The stuffed mushrooms were not very good with the mushrooms themselves being watery and the stuffing being rather flavorless. For the main I tried one of the specials of the evening which was a veal cutlet served on top of prosciutto cook in a white wine reduction. The veal was nice but the prosciutto was a bit on the stringy side with the edges crisp but the center (which was under the veal) on the mushy side. As for the sauce with mushrooms and sauteed spinach, there was no hint of the fruity notes of a wine reduction sauce. When I mentioned that to our server she got rather off-puttingly defensive.

However, after having dined here four or five times, I feel I've given Maki Maki enough chances to over/underwhelm me and I'm prepared to pass a little judgment on these collective experiences.  Please keep in mind that the following review represents an amalgamation of four or five visits over the course of a year and a half (the most recent of which was at the time of this review), not one specific experience.\\n\\nFirst impressions (three stars):  This is a popular spot on weekends, and very busy/noisy.  It makes for a pleasant, convivial atmosphere after dark.  I did go there during daylight hours once on a Sunday, and kind of wish I hadn't.  The d√©cor (which I have come to term, \\"Tokyo bordello\\" - lots of black curtains, neon, water features, leatherette, and black shiny formica) doesn't bear up well in direct sunlight.  Although I am sure the place was clean, I found the tables and floor to be little bit sticky, which I hadn't noticed during my later-hour visits.  \\n\\nService (two stars):  This is the Achilles heel of Maki Maki.  Front of the house is spotty at best, with the greeters podium inconsistently manned and a seeming lack of organization in terms of seating parties as they come in.  Reservations are suggested, but they won't make much of a difference to your wait times on weekends.  Table service is consistently sub-par.  My wait staff have varied from pleasant to not-so-pleasant, but all seemed to be stretched way too thin over way too many tables.  If you want to know how an all-you-can eat sushi restaurant stays in business, here's the secret: after the wait staff takes the first round of orders, you pretty much never get to talk to them again.  Multiple times I've tried and failed to flag down our waiter to make additional orders.   On the rare occasion that I'm successful, it then takes an extraordinarily long time for those additional orders to show up.  I've also noticed that some of the staff seem to physically cringe as they impatiently wait for you to tell them what else you'd like; and in one case the waiter actually left before the entire table had placed their additional requests.  Look, I feel guilty enough about going out to an \\"all-you-can-eat\\" restaurant in the first place.  I know what I'm doing to myself, and I'm not proud of it; but the last thing I need is the wait-staff making me feel even more guilty for placing my order, as if I'm either inconveniencing them or they are passing public judgment on my lack of self-control.  \\n\\nFood (two-and-a-half stars):  The food here is decent.  It's far from the freshest and best sushi I've ever eaten, but certainly passable.  Appetizers vary, with soggy/heavy steamed shumi, oily fired gyoza, decently-done tempura, and nearly inedible spare ribs with the bone in.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here if it wasn't all-you-can-eat, and for the reasons mentioned above I don't think I'll be going out of my way to eat here again.  The one highlight: tempura oreos and ginger or green tea ice cream for dessert.  The fact that I'm highlighting dessert should tell you what I think about the rest of the meal.\\n\\nVerdict:  Not the worst place to spend an evening, but probably not worth the money unless you've got a lot of time and patience on your hands."},{"name":"49th Parallel Coffee","address":"2902 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Good coffee, good doughnuts, not too much of a hipster vibe.

Definately not disappointed.  My wife and I started with the stuffed clams.  With most stuffed clams I've had, while tasty, the stuffing is usually dense.  This stuffing was incredibly light, creamy and was full of flavor.  The creaminess probably comes from the lobster cream they add.  It also had a good amount of seafood in it, which some places skip.  I also tried the mac and cheese just because I always try everyone's mac and cheese.  Not disappointed.  Again very creamy.  Some mac and cheese ends up with clumps of cheese, but the combination of the cheddar, asiago and gruyere was fantastic.  My wife had the special St Louis crab salad which was loaded with crab.  I had the fish taco which they make with one of the Fish of the Day.  Today was Cajun swordfish.  I had to go light on the seasoning because my wife loves fish tacos and doesn't tolerate the heat.  It wasn't bad but would have been better with more seasoning.\\nThe other thing I loved was that when our dishes were ready, they were brought out by anyone who had the time instead of waiting for our waitress who may be busy.

It's the first restaurant I've ever liked enough to go somewhat regularly.\\n\\nIsland Hopper has great service on the weekdays because usually there are very few people in the restaurant.  I've been there once on a Friday night and it was really busy, though--so don't be dissuaded by the scarcity of patrons.\\n\\nThe prices vary.  I've never had any of the specials because they're the more expensive things on the menu, and because of that, I've always gone with the cheaper stuff.  The food is great and the portions are just right--not too little, not too much to make you feel gross or unable to finish.\\n\\nAppetizers- the chicken satay is very good, and not too expensive.  If you're in the mood for soup, the won ton soup is made with a perspicuously strong amount of ginger, but trust me, it's good.\\n\\nAs far as the non-special main dishes go, the Nenas chicken/shrimp/tofu is the most aesthetically-minded dish, I think; it's served in a pineapple shell.  The sesame chicken and General Gau's chicken are not too different from their stereotypical preparation, but they're still really good.\\n\\nThe Thai Seafood Noodle Soup is a little bit spicy and there's a lot of liquid.  It tastes good, but I'd like it more as an appetizer-sized portion. I think it's too much for a main dish.  The Hokkien Lo Mein is a good variation on lo mein, and has a nice taste, but it gets a little dry. I would suggest getting soup or a drink with it.\\n\\nCheck on the back page for smoothies- these are super good and they complement the meals very well. The portions, again, are just adequate.

They didn't have a beer and wine list but instead you could walk up to a chalkboard in the crowded inside to figure out what they had. Now they not only have a menu, they also have more extensive wine options. The food has improved as well. If you order anything with beer cheese you will be good to go..period. Their beer cheese is sharp cheddar, lager, garlic, and pure deliciousness.  The baguettes have also improved since the first experience. The salami and beer cheese baguette is definitely my favorite. A friend ordered this recently, smiled and stated it tasted like Cuba. For a healthier option I am also a fan of the smoked turkey breast sandwich with Pain Au Levain bread, avocado, radish and roasted jalapeno aioli.

Last night after I picked my husband up at the airport we gave this place a chance. Here's my breakdown:\\n\\nThe bread: As another Yelper stated, stale. Usually my husband and I crush a basket of bread and at Bertucci's we even get refills. Why? Because we love warm, crusty, soft bread. This had the \\"crusty\\" part but the other factors were missing. \\n\\nThe service: Pleasant but brusque. We also had to wait until we got our check for water refills (my husband usually puts away 2 glasses of water and a Diet Coke, so he was parched). \\n\\nThe appetizer: We ordered the caprese salad, which was underwhelming. It looked like dried basil sprinkled on top and there was no balsamic. Not terrible, just not noteworthy either. \\n\\nThe entrees: These were actually terrible. My husband ordered the pesto gnocchi and I ordered some combination of chicken parm + eggplant + mozzarella with pasta of the day and red sauce. After trying to choke down his overcooked gnocchi and day-old/bottled/flavorless pesto, my husband gave up and came over to my meal. Let it be known this man rarely leaves food on his plate, so for him to bail on his meal not even halfway through after trying to flavor it up with salt and pepper, it's a bad sign. On my first bite of chicken I thought, \\"This tastes like frozen chicken. Or cafeteria chicken.\\" The pasta and sauce were mediocre for me, but my husband thought the sauce was flavorless and probably the worst he'd ever had. \\n\\nIn closing, as we walked away I said to my husband, \\"I'm glad we live in Boston because if we were visiting for just a few days, I would be incredibly sad that we wasted our Italian meal here.\\" After living in Boston for 6 years, I can finally say I've had my first bad meal in the North End."},{"name":"Blazing Tomato Pizza and Pasta","address":"8145 International Dr, Ste 531","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I'm impressed and very satisfied.

First off, do not be afraid of pork knuckle.  It is full of all of your fatty and porky daily needs.  This was some really good food and the egg was a revelation.

It was a perfectly cooked, flavorful piece of salmon on a bed of polenta. \\n\\nThe Tuna tacos were an interesting dish. The tacos are assembled by you, you get all the ingredients, and assemble it yourself! The tuna was cooked very well, but I feel it was too mild. The salmon I just mentioned tasted like salmon, the tuna had a taste so mild, you'd have to look for it even if you ate it w/o the tacos. \\n\\nOther things I will mention about this dish is that I would have liked more beans, pico, and guac. Speaking of guac, it was not the highest quality I had. As for the tuna, there were two good sized pieces, but one that was only a half-piece. I will give them big points though for grilling the tortillas, and for a delicious slaw of vegetables.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, even though the dish had several imperfections, everything still came together very nicely.\\n\\nServer was perfect: polite, cheerful, attentive, knowledgeable.\\n\\nFinally, I will mention this place is a bit pricey. I won't go as far as saying this place isn't a good value, but I cannot say it is a great value."},{"name":"Cinco Mexican Cantina","address":"2851 Akers Mill Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Eric was a dang fantastic waiter.

This is namely the manager and the slightly older lady that has the glasses, though she sometimes takes them off. You'll know who she is because she's the loudest one.\\n\\nOn the Chicken: \\n1. When it's fresh, it's amazing! But sometimes the ratio of the spices can be off. This means that the spicy chicken isn't quite as spicy as what you'd expect. \\n2. Temperature, if you're eating this at the location it's not too bad. But if you're driving just 5 minutes back home, your chicken can be cold by the time you bring it in the home. \\n3. If you want it fresh, then you have to ask. Sometimes, if your order is large enough IE 10+ pieces, or if you're crazy like me and want 10 white pieces of chicken, they say it's going to have to fry it fresh and you're going ot have to wait 15 minutes. If you want your chicken to taste amazing in your seat, whether you're at home or in the booth, you want to wait.\\n\\nCoupons: \\n1. Always use your coupons ==\\". The Combos are a big waste of time. Get the 3 piece dark meat special, the buy one get one chicken thigh sandwich, the buy one + add 2$ for the chicken breast sandwich, or one of the other coupons.\\n2. Bring your phone! I don't understand why more people are not showing their phones with the coupon at Churches. You don't need the actual coupon they mail to you, and you don't have to get them printed out. *click...type...boop* and show the coupon.\\n\\nAddressing some issues:\\n1. 15 minutes is the standard cooking time for fried chicken. If you have to wait, so be it because you're getting fresh chicken that will taste great, have great texture, and be MOIST.\\n\\nHopefully this provides some much needed clarity to this location.\\n\\nThe reason why I rated this location the way I did is because of the variable quality of chicken I was served, incorrect orders, and poor customer service at times; however, it's not even that bad right now. If I see some of the regular guys and gals working there (I live 2 blocks away, I go very, very often) I know service will be either acceptable or great. If I don't see them, it's unfortunate, but at least I'll have chicken. Win-Win.\\n\\nAccording to those that have been in the chicken game longer than I have been alive, the best locations for Church's Chicken is the one located at 41st and Fraser opposite of John Oliver Secondary School, and the other located near Hastings and Nanaimo opposite of Red Wagon and Tacofino.\\n\\nThe other location that is pretty good in my opinion, is the Church's chicken located on Kingsway near the Edmonds area.

We were lucky to be second in line because as soon as we got in line, there were several other groups behind us. The line became SUPER long! We recommend coming right at 8:30 because if you try to come at 9 AM when they open, the line has already formed. This is when you know the food is a MUST HAVE.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is comfortable, very homey. The restaurant fits in almost any setting either on the street, by the ocean, off a cliff, or even in the middle of nowhere. The back seating feels intimate whereas the front seating feels more diner-like. I love both sides and was hoping we would sit in the front. There's an open kitchen and seating for those who want to sit at the counter. There's so much light with the long windows, which helps us Yelpers take better photos! Our server was on top of pouring water, checking in on us, and making sure the food was out promptly. \\n\\nLet's talk about food!\\n\\nChicken fried chicken - It's on the top of my list for chicken fried steak. The gravy was good, the biscuit was oh so soft, and the chicken was well seasoned. Portland, you are doing something right. If we had just ordered three of these, I'm sure everyone at the table would be in heaven.\\n\\nBurmese red pork stew - We were all thinking this would be an actual stew, but it came out with rice, pork, and an egg atop. For those who know what Ru Rou Fan (aka Taiwanese braised pork rice) is in Taiwan, this is exactly how it tasted, but MUCH BETTER. There's something to the marination that I can't quite put my finger on.\\n\\nChocolate potato doughnut - As an appetizer or dessert, it doesn't matter. I thought it would just be a stomach filler, but it's quite tasty. The chocolate is not too overpowering and the sauce is similar to condensed milk. It's doughy, but doesn't taste under cooked. I love that the outside is crispy and the inside is soft. \\n\\nMaple and cumin glazed yams - If my candied yams tastes like this, I'd want it ALL the time. This gave me an idea that I'd be doing this for Thanksgiving. \\n\\nThis restaurant is almost like a course meal in terms of the waiting period. They serve one dish at a time for the entire table (so definitely a family style meal). Because our server explained the reason, it was not off-putting.

Flair jumps off the plates and sometimes burns little holes in your clothes if you're not careful.\\n\\nIf they're serving the scallop appetizers, you MIGHT want to consider ordering nothing else.... or you might want to consider ordering a plate of the calimari to go with it, because you don't want to miss that either.  Ok, and but leave some room for the bread pudding dessert too.\\n\\nIt tends to be pretty lively, so might not be the BEST place for a first date, unless you don't mind shouting a lot.  That said though, if you take a date here for the food, it's pretty much sure fire guaranteed to impress.

I expected a salad, but I got about five halved brussel sprouts (neatly) placed over a puree. It was all gone before I even tasted the first bite.\\n2.) Grilled Oysters: Yum!

Blistered Shishito Peppers: A big, delicious bowl of shishitos peppers that were accompanied by a side of creamy dipping sauce. I think for the value, this dish is worth it, especially compared to what FINO offers.\\n4.) Warm Niman Ranch Pork Cheeks: Mindbogglingly tender pieces of cheek meat. It's paired perfectly with the buttered pieces of toast. Honestly, I nearly started a fork war with my companion over the last piece.\\n5.) Fried Brie: A little bit of sweet with a little bit of salty.

Nothing outstanding.\\n\\nFor entrees, we ordered and shared the lobster raviolis, the open ravioli (lobster, scallops,shrimp and zucchini with a cream sauce), and the seafood pasta (with fettucini). The entrees are HUGE. The lobster ravioli was stuffed with cheese and lobster. The red sauce was good and lobster-y. I liked the open ravioli more. The cream sauce was amazing! I could taste the white wine, cream and butter. I poured that sauce over the lobster ravioli. The proteins and zucchini in the open ravioli was really good. Big cuts and lots of flavor.

I don't know what happened since the last time i was here.  I'm guessing new management?!  Or the management became a cheap ass swindler.  First off the food:  The food looks almost from the previous day instead of fresh natural foods their sign promises.  The salad lettuce leaves were wilted more than If Wilt Chamberlain slam dunked on Walt Wiltman.  I know, i know, just go with it for me.  Anyways, i used to LOVE the lunch deal.  Well DEAL NO MORE!  They may say they have a deal, its right in front of your face at the register: $6.29 for schwarma sandwich and soup or salad.  I added a $1.00 bottle of water(bc they refuse to offer FREE water, even on tap.  I thought there was a law against that.).  So that would come to a total of $7.29 right?  plus 6% tax, right?!  NO!  The very nice(and by nice a mean a total evil ugly woman) she charged me $8.50.  How's that add up?!  I nicely said, i think you entering the wrong meal, i'd like the lunch meal deal for 6.29, like the paper says in front of your fat face.  \\"Sir! Sir! NO, u will pay 7.99 plus tax!\\"  We seriously went back and forth 4 times.  She refused to honor the lunch meal that is advertised in front of her fat face.  I thought maybe i was the only person this happened to, but my buddy said the same thing happened to him last week until he argued with the guy, who eventually realized the scam is done, and charged him correctly.  This cash register lady was not having it.  The cheapness trickles down the totem pole though.  I wasn't even OFFERED a soup(which i wanted bc the salad was freaking nasty looking), so i guess the soup cost to much to create on a daily basis...you know being basically white beans and water and salt and all...real expensive stuff.  The meat was dryer than the past, probably recycled from the previous day. Shame of the Shawrma as i called it with every dissapointed bite. \\n\\nThe A/C is expensive around this time of year, so don't count on THAT being included in your $8.50 upcharge.  Its kinda cool i guess bc it gives you that authentic middle east desert feel.  Nothing like sweating while i eat.

No joke, i wanted to finish as fast as a could bc she was putting a curse on me.....well that, and the sweat dripping down my back on my work shirt. \\n\\nI hate to say it, but when restaraunts start skimping on the little things, or out right denying a deal advertised right at the register, i lose faith, and there for Mr. Habibi, you have LOST my business."},{"name":"The Smoke Shop BBQ - Seaport","address":"343 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great service & decent bbq.

I've been wanting to go here for two years, so it was a major disappointment. \\n\\nNot going to bash the place, IJS  7pm on Sunday night is probably not the best time to go if you want to have a good time.  Saying that, I'll also say, this is the kinda place where you take a group of friends and make the party for yourself. \\n\\nLet start with the four guys \\"watching the door\\".  I was wondering why they had the four huge guys watching the door and the velvet rope up when you could tell from the parking lot that the place was empty. $10 to park is a joke, this is Buckhead, and parking meters are free on Sunday. I was totally shocked when the guy told me he needed to search my purse,  I don't think I've ever had my bag searched at a restaurant, yes a club, I guess they are stemming towards the bar/club aspect than a restaurant. \\n\\nI was there for a birthday party that was suppose to start at 7. I got there at 7:03 and walked in as some others were arriving when the hostess told us that she was not aware of any party.  By this time there were seven of us there for said party.  One other person show the hostess a picture of the person that coordinated the party and she says, oh she promotes parties here, but she's not here yet.  \\n\\nThankfully, I had reserved a table, so I was able to be sat immediately, whereas she told the other 5 people they'd have to wait for the \\"party promoter\\" to show up.  She did about 5 minutes later and they started pulling together some tables for the group.  \\n\\nWhile we waited, I walked up to one of the bars and had to gesture to the bartender to walk down to the side of the bar where I was, asked about specialty drinks, she stated there weren't any, I said, well they say you have them online, she replies, well, we don't tonight.  So I ask if she has champagne or prosecco  and she says, we have house champagne,  I inquired what brand it was and she said she didn't know, she didn't attempt to find out, so I walked away from the bar. \\n\\nShortly, the hostess sat me and my plus one up at a table and a few minutes later a waitress comes up and tells me, that I cant sit there because that table is reserved for bottle service. Seeing as how I was there for this party, it seems as if she would have asked me what bottle I wanted to purchase, but since she assumed I wasn't.  I didn't. The party promoter explained that I was with the party, but it was too late by then. I politely moved to the smaller table she directed me too.My plus one, was interested in getting a hooka, we were not offered one of those either.\\n\\nWe still had our menus from the hostess sitting us and since most reviews recommended the lamb and mac and cheese, that was what i requested only to be told the only thing they had was, fish and grits, salmon wellington, tacos, wings or salad. There dinner menu features 9 entrees and they had a total of 3 of them. \\n\\nI went with the Jerk BBQ chicken taco ($11) for three.  Basically it was chopped up chicken with some shredded cheese on top. I asked the person that dropped off our plates if there was some kind or sauce to accompany the tacos, he stated it was and brought it out.  Why it wasn't bought with the tacos is a mystery to me.   The sauce gave the tacos life,  otherwise, it was gonna be dry chicken on a soft taco shell. \\n\\nMy plus one, ordered the fish and grits and was asked how she wanted the fish, we were thinking the lady was asking if she wanted fried, grilled, etc, since the menu says its blacken, but she was actually asking if she wanted it medium or well done.  She wanted to know if the fish should be thoroughly cooked on a fish and grit dinner.  SMDH  It didn't matter either way, because she sent it back.  The grit cake was cold, and the fish only had seasoning on top of the fish was flavorless. It was taken back with no issues an removed from our check. \\n\\nSomeone at the group table ordered the salad ($11) with grilled shrimp ($5).  She received four regular sized shrimp. \\n\\nDuring the time our order was placed, our server came back to our table twice, once to take the plate back and second to bring the check. \\n\\nI consider myself to be a smart girl, and in saying that I say, the locks don't work on the ladies room door.

I had the strip steak, it was a very thin cut that was strangely covered in a large clump of herb butter and swimming in a sweet and sourish too heavy sauce (why the sauce and the butter?). It was also covered in a mound of decent french fries, but the plate was too small and when I cut into the meat fries went all overt he table.

The waitress came by and asked two of us for our drink orders, then when the new person arrived she met her, took her order, and brought her wine and nothing for us. Our drinks finally arrived separately, and my martini was so salty I couldn't even finish it.  Each time we ordered more drinks, they all came out separately.  The happy hour food was marginal at best. We ordered the first appetizer, the calamari and it was awful! The grease it was fried in was old, and it was way too salty.  Then we ordered the crab cake, which they broke down into sliders for us, and the smoky oysters.  Don't bother with the oysters!  They were NOT smoked, and they had so many artificial bacon bits on them you couldn't even taste the oyster.  The crab cake was ok, though on too much bread.

Tables around us were somewhat cleared but not cleaned (pieces of food were still on the tables, cake was smashed/smeared on the high bar tables at the front entrance ... not a very good first impression).   Our waitress seemed stressed but she was attentive.  We split the Misto salad and hubby ordered the Eggplant/Chicken Parm with a side of Ziti marinara and I, the Shrimp Scampi.   Generous portions and hubby enjoyed the parm combo and didn't get to his ziti based on the size of the parm.  He enjoyed the dish but not the ambiance.

The Beast delivers.  Not to get too pulp fictiony on you, but as we left i thought, \\"lets get something to eat.\\"  Don't bring a big appetite to this establishment just a fat billfold.  When they asked us to leave it was like, \\"why are they kicking us out before the main course arrives?\\"  I found it all very weird because you would think for $250+/couple you wouldn't remember a thing about this place except for the fact that you would wake up full, hopefully way hungover, and not feel like eating for 3 days.  \\nNot the case here.  In fairness, we were with a group of 16 people, one of whom ordered 3 bottles of wine at, i would guess, in the $50-90 range so that boosted things a little.  I personally, had one $20 bottle of beer, which was almost worth it because i like Belgian beer but the bottom line here is don't be fooled by the name. \\n You would think with a name like Beast, one would be facing mounds of meat and some type of Viking ritual thrown in for good measure.  What you get is a perfectly pretentious overpriced evening of frinkled pompadue, and 3 or 4 plates of hors d'oeuvres interrupted by a soup served in an oversized thimble barely big enuf to get a spoon into.  I'm not going to lie to you here, the soup was dam good.  But I'm pretty much a blue collar working stiff trying to make my no doc triple B rated traunch mortgage payments on time, while bailing out Wallstreet, so i've only heard of a cup of soup and a bowl of soup.  Never heard of a shot  of soup.  So consider the source here.\\nI was told later on, much to my surprise, that the main course was actually the cube of pork belly.  And this is part of my frustration.  If i'm going to surgically remove a 1/2\\" sliver of meat out of a cube of blubber, i want that cube of blubber to be carved out of something exotic or on the endangered species list like a blue whale, or rhino, or silver back ape.  That way i could brag how i got a slice of that before we totally destroyed that select grouping of DNA.   No.  It was just a garden variety pig.  \\n\\nIf money is no object and you like hearing eloquent elaborence of the artfully done culinary prep , which takes about twice as long as it does to eat it, then by all means, Beast may be your destination.  If you have to work for a living and don't want to fly to NY for this kind of enchanting evening but love eating little sculptures, then hit a mexican restaurant on the way and bring a few roadies to prime that buzz."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"7330 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This location has changed names several times.

But I also recall that it is right next to a Wawa, and as someone who grew up in Wawa territory, this was a very welcome revelation.  Parking is free and plentiful, and from the exterior, it's clear that this is primarily a sit-down or take-out kind of restaurant.\\n\\nEntering the restaurant, you're welcomed by the succulent meaty aroma of cooked meat of creatures lower on the food chain.  As for the seating itself, this 4 Rivers had a handful of tables meant for smaller parties, but for the most part there are numerous long tables meant for communal dining and the occasional need to sit next to strangers.  It's slightly more of the same on the patio.\\n\\nFor whatever reason, a large portion of the establishment is a bakery appearing to sell a large variety of cupcakes, and other sweet baked goods.  Sure, they all looked fantastic in their own right, but I did find it a little odd in its presence.  If anything at all, the typical sweet baked aroma of freshly baked pastries and desserts is completely negated by the smell of barbecue that permeates the entire place.\\n\\nOrdering is done before seating, and I had just arrived at the very tail end of a Friday lunch rush, as the line was long upon entering, but didn't gratifyingly get longer after me.  I ended up ordering a burnt ends stacker, which came with two sides, to which I chose collards and cheese grits.\\n\\nUltimately, I ate outside because it was a beautiful day, and it added to my enjoyable experience.  The sandwich's portion of meat was generous and heaping, and despite looking kind of like a messy sloppy joe in appearance, the flavor was phenomenal.  I love burnt ends to begin with, but the way 4 Rivers kind of mashes them together prior to serving allows for a lot of charred, smoky flavor to burst through, without feeling like you're chewing leather.  The house sauces both erred on slightly sweet, but both were enjoyable.  Maybe a little heat for the supposed hot variant, but it's nothing to have a legitimate gripe about.\\n\\nSides are where I tend to become critical with barbecue joints, because so often times I've been to places where the barbecue is great, but the sides underwhelm.  4 Rivers did not fall into that category for me, as the collards were slightly sweet, but had good tang and an overall flavor.  They don't bother to hide the use of pork juice when making either, which as a carnivorous glutton, is the only way.  The cheese grits are made in the fashion where they can served as patties instead of in a cup or anything, but were still good, without being bland or having flavors too separated to be enjoyable together.\\n\\nOverall, everything about my experience at 4 Rivers was fantastic.  A generous portion of lunch was definitely not outrageously priced at like $12, and the quality of the meats as well as the sides were top-notch.  It did not seem like a nuisance to get to, the parking was a cinch, the atmosphere was jovial and the establishment was clean.  I would most definitely want to come back in my future trips to Orlando.

But this meal was simply forgettable, and the combination of awkward communal seating, uncomfortable chairs, and excruciating pacing made it a complete emperor's new clothes experience. \\n\\nI was expecting bold, daring, primal food. Instead, I got bland, uninspired stuff more appropriate for a midwestern wedding than an allegedly special restaurant in a 'foodie' town. Everything I ate was either boring or downright 'off.' The menu felt straight out of the early 1990s -- there was simply nothing interesting going on here, from a culinary point of view. I got so bored by the food that I eventually stopped finishing stuff on my plates. Pork tenderloin atop a mound of mashed potatoes? Am I having a flashback to 1992? Where's the fat, the skin, the bones? Where's the nose-to-tail sensibility? How can a place in Portland that calls itself 'Beast' get away with serving the blandest part of the entire pig? Humboldt Fog cheese? My corner bodega sells that stuff by the pre-wrapped wedge. Etc.\\n\\nThis food is a perfect exemplar of a genre I call \\"farm to table to yawn.\\" Chez Panisse was groundbreaking, but it also licensed a million middling chefs to bring people uncreative food, justifying its prosaic quality by saying \\"it's all about the ingredients.\\" At Beast, even the few creative moments were total fails. Fois gras on a peanut butter shortbread cookie w/ a gelee cube atop? Not even in Ferran Adria's nightmares would this be okay.\\n\\nThe only saving grace is that we were seated in the middle of a row at the big communal table, so we didn't have to make polite conversation with anyone else, and could instead critique the meal with gusto. Everybody at the restaurant got the same exact food at the same time, served course by plodding course, so if we'd had to talk with other people for the three hours we were there, I would have petitioned yelp for a \\"negative stars\\" option.\\n\\nIf you're in Portland and you want a peak food experience, go to any of Andy Ricker's places. Go to Gruner. Go to Lardo. Go to Ned Ludd. But please don't go near Beast. Don't be fooled by any of the hype, or the quotes by Julia Child and Oscar Wilde written all over the walls, or the \\"substitutions politely declined\\" policy (which usually suggests a creative genius in the kitchen, but in this case just felt like laziness.)

The food combinations to me just didn't make logical sense and it felt like the restaurant was trying to appeal to a high class concept but it wasn't executed well since there was the fresh vegetables mixed with a ranch kind of  covering on the food with a topping of popping boba that I wasn't accustomed to and wasn't really appealing to me or any of the taste palettes that I've switched around with. The mix of the tart vinaigrette/ ranch topping with super saturated sweet popping boba and bitter vegetables honestly were very overpowering   We actually chose a combination that was recommended to us as being the most popular and for the price we paid, it honestly wasn't worth it.

It is based out of the home of Mark DesLauriers and his wife in their stunning home located in the Brickbottom Artist Association Building on Fitchburg Street in Somerville.  It's the blue and white striped building you can see from McGrath Highway, but you have to go on Washington Street to get to it.  My mother in law found out about ArtEpicure by chatting with the folks at New Deal Fish Market, and I found the website and we signed up for the Winter Soups and Stews class.  He also does a number of other classes that are much more out of the ordinary, such as Molecular Gastronomy  and Sous Vide cooking.  If you don't know what those types of cooking are, look them up and go visit Mark if you're curious.\\n\\nUpon arriving, the building was a great space to begin with.  We were buzzed in, and were greeted by Mark.  He's very friendly and we hurried into his home.  The cooking school is in the artists building, which is also his house.  It was lined with rows of books (many cookbooks, of course mixed in), various collections lining the walls up to the tall ceilings, and decorated with a variety of vintage furniture.  The smell of roasting lamb and other delicious aromas.  We saddled up to his kitchen island and waited for the two other participants.\\n\\nOnce everyone had arrived, we started on the first soup, which was a homemade cream of tomato soup.  It consisted of six ingredients, and was perfection.  Most of the soups required minimal prep (relatively) and this one was the most simple, but was beautiful.  It cooked for an hour and was pureed into the the most creamy, delicious tomato soup.  The next soup was a squash, apple and coconut soup with a chutney on top, that was my favorite.  It had many spices, including curry, so it gave it a fantastic infusion of different flavors....the apples made it very homey, and the curry gave it an exotic flavor.  It was exceptionally creamy due to the coconut milk.  The squash, apple, and coconut soup was one of the best soups I've ever had, and it's definitely inspired me to make more soups.  The next was a lamb barley stew, which had amazing flavor.  It was made with a chicken and beef stock combo, and was so rich, warm, and filling.  It had some much great flavor and I don't think I've enjoyed lamb as much as I did in that stew.  It was rich in barley and parsnips and was something dreams are made of on a cold, New England night.  The last soup was a classic French Cassoulet, which I knew a little about, but have never had.  It consisted of pork bellies, chicken, and the most amazing homemade sausage I've ever had, in a white bean base.  The sausage was the show stopper for me, but the dish was wonderful.  I was full by the end and held off on eating all the beans, but it was pure heaven.\\n\\nClass prices range from $55 to $89, and are three or four hours long.   The price was well worth it (for four courses at a restaurant, is it going to be under those prices and will you get the recipes?), and you can bring your own bottle of whatever you'd like to drink.  It was a fantastic class, and a very fun outing.

They're located two blocks away from Gateway Skytrain in Surrey.\\n\\nI went there for lunch on Friday, and the place wasn't packed, but a steady flow of people kept coming in. Mostly business-type folk from the surrounding offices.\\n\\nThe owners are super friendly - They tell me that theirs are authentic  family recipes. Their vision was to bring a little bit of Mexico to Canada.\\n\\nTheir menu has  a little bit of everything: nachos, chimichangas, burritos, tortas, tacos, you name it. Their tacos are made the traditional Mexican way.\\n\\nThe food was delicious. I know Mexican food -  and I tell you it was awesome. I just can't believe this place has been here since 2006 and I've never been here!\\n\\nI am very excited to see more and more good restaurants here in Downtown Surrey. Trust me when I tell you that this is one of those restaurants. You can check out what other folks thought of it here: http://dinehere.ca/surrey/taqueria-jalisco-restaurant\\n\\nLa Taqueria Jalisco is open 6 days a week 9am-8pm daily. They have a fantastic Mexican-style breakfast menu.\\n\\nIt's a small restaurant, so you might have to wait for a table if you're dining in, but lucky for you, they also have take-out.\\n\\nFollow them on twitter @taqueriajaliscoSRY or check them out on  Facebook."},{"name":"Bo Laksa King's Famous Laksa & Wraps","address":"4910 Joyce St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"* Authentic Burmese Hole in the Wall with a few other things thrown in *\\n\\nThis spot is easy to miss.  It is a counter tucked into a small convenience store on Joyce Street, not too far from the Joyce Skytrain station.  He has a single seat at the counter and 2 small tables with 2 seats each.  So a grand total of 5 spots to sit.  Classic!  \\n\\nBo used to be the chef at a restaurant downtown which closed 2 months ago, and he opened up this little counter in his friend's convenience store.  Originally from Burma, he apparently also used to work as a chef in several countries in Southeast Asia (including Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore) and picked up recipes along the way.\\n\\nDuring the week the menu is quite simple - a selection of 4 different wraps, and laksa.  On Saturday and Sunday he does Burmese specials which vary each weekend.  \\n\\nFrom the Burmese offerings I've tried the Laphet Thote (pickled tea leaf salad).  I don't know of any other spot in Vancouver that offers this, and the taste is QUITE addictive.  Bo imports the pickled leaves from Burma and puts together a very nice dish.  The texture contrasts between the pickled tea leaves, tomatoes, cabbage, dried/fried beans, toasted peanuts, and crunchy garlic chips is amazing.  There is a hint of fermented shrimp to round out the flavours along with a few raw garlic cloves and raw bird chili peppers.  Truly a wonderful dish with complex layers of flavour that all go well together.  It goes very well with the jasmine tea he serves.\\n\\nHis laksa is one of the only ones I've had in Vancouver that actually had fresh daun laksa (laksa leaf) in it.  There is a generous amount of shrimp, chicken, fish balls, tofu puffs, and a full boiled egg.  The noodles were the perfect consistency.  The broth was fabulous.  It has nicely layered flavours.  \\n\\nAlso tried the \\"roti wrap\\" which is not served in a roti.  It is served in a tortilla.  This is basically a chicken and vegetable curry wrap.  The curry sauce was the highlight of this dish.  I would prefer it with an actual roti instead of a tortilla.  Apparently sometimes he makes fresh roti, but not for the wraps.  During the week I'll stick to the laksa and whatever Burmese specials might sneak onto the menu.\\n\\nOverall this place is a find.  It will take a while for him to figure out what to offer more regularly, and what items to drop.  But it is exciting to see him experiment each week!  \\n\\nI'll definitely be back!"},{"name":"No 9 Restaurant","address":"812-5300 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Lots of dishes.

I was super happy to find out that East Side Pies opened up near my hood.  I ordered a pizza on my way home from work one night for pick up.  I got stuck in traffic (yeah I know... not surprising in Austin) so I was a little late picking it up. More on that in a bit.\\n\\nThis East Side Pies is in an itty bitty building nestled in between a convenience store and a small strip mall.  There is a super small area to eat there so I wouldn't really recommend eating there.  The employees I encountered were friendly and helpful and they had my pizza ready to go when I walked in.\\n\\nWe ordered the Nicola which has meatballs, jalapenos, red onions, roasted red peppers, and gorgonzola.  The small was enough for the hubs and I for dinner and even had left overs for the next day.   By the time I picked it up and got it home, it was more room temp than hot.  I don't blame East Side Pies at all... I blame stupid traffic.  But next time I'll just wait to order once I get there to ensure we get a hot pie to enjoy.\\n\\nThis was my first experience with the meatballs and I have to say I like it!  They were small and halved so they were totally manageable on a slice.  I didn't get a lot of gorgonzola, which was sad... I love that cheese! \\n\\nOverall it was a good experience so we'll be back!\\n\\nIf you are a beer lover, check out the convenience store next to East Side Pies.

Unless you're an absolute cheese addict, the regular cheese pie will more than suffice.  \\n\\nThe regular cheese pie is a true masterpiece of perfect sauce, a light amount of cheese, and a cracker thin crust.

This time I, and my company, were richly rewarded with an amazing dinner at an outstanding value.  Both the food and service were exceptional, bringing Tasty n Sons back in the standing of, what I believe to be, one of the best restaurants in town.  Seasonal, local ingredients, house made pickles and meats, excellent design (simple & industrial yet warm and inviting).  The evenings soundtrack was also a winner.\\n\\n First, what was promised to be a 40 minute wait, turned out to be a short 20 which was quickly passed with a bottle of bubbles.  Once seated, our server was attentive and patiently answered our many queries about the menu.  While there were numerous items that they were out of, the lengthy menu provided many solid alternatives.  We started with my long standing favorites, the radicchio salad and the meat board.  My company gushed about everything.  The salad got a nomination for best salad ever (it is a pretty awesome).  We were served  a complimentary octopus & prawn cocktail which was an unexpected and thoughtful surprise and turned out to be perfectly tender seafood in a chilled, spiced tomato broth.  Our second course was the fried cauliflower and the Brunswick Stew - the latter we would not have ordered but that they were our of our first selections.  This turned out to be very fortunate as this dish was a winner.  Rich and saucy with rabbit so tender it melted in your mouth. The drop dumplings were the perfect accompaniment - airy & sweet.  For dessert we had the fresh baked cookies and ice cream with a couple glasses of Madeira (based on the waiter's recommendation for a good pairing with our dessert - it turned out to be right on).  \\n\\nAs unbelievable as the food was and as satiated as we all felt, the bill was surprisingly small.

The broth was rich and substantive, it didnt burn like some Jamaican curries Ive tried - and it didnt have that pungent odor that you sweat out your pores the following day spice. The curry at GT spice seemed very balanced; strong, but not overpowering. Hot, but not eye watering. Was it nutmeg that made the difference? Maybe?\\n\\nAnd this is where the roti's come in ... you use the roti to sop up every last bit of sauce. It was some kind of good!\\n\\nThey had a table condiment, a pickled product, I think it was mango and lime Achaar - I couldnt tell you what it was for sure - but they make it there in the shop .. and we bought a bottle all ready finished half of it.\\n\\nThe owner of the shop, Prem, is rightfully very proud of his business and the quality of their product - a likeable young man and great conversationalist.

The chicken and fish were good and the shrimp was pretty good -- not the best shrimp. The pork was mostly fat and was inedible. The tacos are dressed with lettuce and shredded cheese, like you might expect at Taco Bell. I was a little disappointed in that, but the sauce, a sriracha style sauce spiced it up nicely.

Again, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't a 5-star breakfast either.  Lastly, seating in the cozy cafe consists of 4 stools at a tiny side counter.

The waitress brought 2 menus -- one for tapas and the other for Chinese food. We decided to order tapas. After giving us the menu, the waitress disappeared for about 15 minutes.

This was a bad sign considering there were only 4 other people in the entire restaurant and they didn't have drinks or food yet either. \\n\\nWe ordered the Chicken lettuce wraps, blue cheese fondue, sliders, pork rib wraps and calamari. The tapas came out one at a time... very slowly! There was about a 20 minute wait between every tapas plate. The food was very tasty and different.

The rest is history.  \\n\\nWhile traveling to Portland again, this time with family and friends, I decided to give their taste buds the gift of this grilled cheese sandwich.  I insisted everyone order it. \\n\\nWe were greeted by the best waiter in Portland who took our orders.  We waited patiently, taking in the scenery that was a taxidermy bear with a monocle and some old victorian style paintings.  We talked about the latest gossip and chatted about the news but my eyes were on the price the second that sandwich came out of the kitchen and made its way to our table. \\n\\nWhen we all consecutively opened our mouths and took in this grilled cheese - it was a symphony of moans.  My eyes rolled back as I swallowed my first bite of this warm sharp cheddar delight.  The cheese oozed from out the sides of the bread discharging its golden goodness.   My teeth bit into the crispiness of the bread and my tongue licked and caressed the grooves of the grill marks while my throat yearned to accept its fate. My first bite made its way to the back of the throat and was tugged down into my esophagus.  My stomach groaned with the desire to digest this magical creation.   I've never been in an orgy before but I can imagine it being very similar to this. \\n\\nI thought to myself, \\"Would the second bite be as good as the first? I doesn't matter I need more.\\"\\n\\nAnother bite.  Another journey into bliss.\\n\\nI heard, like an echo in my head someone's voice, \\"How is it?\\"  When I looked up it was the man himself.  My golden lion, my lord and savior, our waiter who brought me this perfect sandwich.   I couldn't answer him with screaming delight because as much as I wanted to tell him he changed my world, I had to play it off like this was just some ordinary dish, \\"Good!\\" I said. I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of family and friends.  Although they were moaning and proclaiming passionate obscenities about this satisfying sandwich, it would have been embarrassing if they knew just how hard I was getting for this meal. \\n\\nIt wasn't the first and it won't be the last time I let that grilled cheese sandwich take advantage of my senses."},{"name":"Pho Zen","address":"15936 SE Happy Valley Town Ctr Dr","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Our party tried a variety of items.

Seriously maybe my new favorite venue (well, except for the portapotties)--the tasting room is new construction and air-conditioned and nicely designed, and the property is truly scenic. Grab a beer in the tasting room and head out to picnic tables set underneath shady trees, overlooking the Hill Country. This weekend--long past wildflower season--there were purple wildflowers blooming across a wide field. Truly beautiful. You can bring your dog or a deck of cards or just sit and chat and you'll have a good time. They also invite out a food truck each week.\\n\\nThe set up is also nice. For $10 a person you get the requisite glass and a beer list--you can try each of 6 beers on the list and they want you to go generally in order from top to bottom (lightest to darkest). The beer list is cute (I know, cute is not a word often used at a beer place, but this list is designed to like a fancy dinner menu, so yeah, cute) and very descriptive, and they just mark beers off as you try them. I like this system. \\n\\nBut...the beer. I'm....not a fan (yet, anyway). I'd heard from a friend who'd been that the beers were all very dark. This must be seasonal because on 6/9 the beers were all rather light (4/6 were roughly the same yellow to orangey color, as in not brown to black)--ranging from a dull \\"table beer\\" with 2.9% ABV to a mediocre summer wheat to a very strange \\"champagne-like\\" Boxers Revenge brew that despite smelling interesting, was overly tart and rather undrinkable (as in I really could not drink it, and having tasted mine, my husband decided to skip it entirely). The Amager rye porter way down at the very bottom was actually pretty good and I'd order it at a restaurant (it's listed as a guest tap, does that mean it's not really a Jester King beer?).

So many restaurants phone it in on bread and butter, which to me is a disturbing sign of overall indifference to the fact that every part of dining should please the mouth.  The grilled mozzarella appetizer was creative and tasty - I loved the skewers and the tangy lemon dressing that coated everything.  I wasn't in love with my flat iron steak - at other restaurants it's come sliced and sauced, which I think is done to work with the strong flavor of the meat.

Maybe it was an \\"off\\" night for them when I was there on a very busy last Saturday night.  First of all I thought the process just to be seated was awful.  You stand inside the front door (because the bar area is full) in front of diners trying to enjoy their meal, for a good 5-10 minutes before even being acknowledged by the \\"hostess\\", who then writes your name on a piece of scrap paper.  I know this very harried hostess has no idea what I looked like, and thus where to find me while I wait sitting at the outside tables, so I have to go back and check in with him and thus another 5 minutes of standing there in the middle of everything.  Finally a couple of large groups leave and I see 8 tables cleared and since I've been #2 on the wait list for 20 minutes now I'm thinking surely we will be seated pronto, but alas, no dice.  I'm told ALL the tables have to be set up first.  At last our party of three is led to a small table right by the front door, and when we ask to be moved to a better (empty and set) table in the corner we are told only if we want to wait another 10 minutes because the waiter can't handle that many people in his station (which currently had 4 empty tables).  Hmmm, not the best start.\\n\\nI ordered the gnocchi, as this is my favorite \\"first dish\\" to try at any Italian place.  It was awful: bland, over-cooked and dry, with a scant portion of the sage brown butter sauce, and I couldn't taste a difference between the outside and what it was supposedly stuffed with on the inside. All I tasted was potato.  Desperately I looked for salt but there was none on the tables. When I complained to the waitress about the dish being dry and needing more sauce, she just smiled rather manically and said that is one of the favorites!  The only reason this gets 2 stars vs. 1 star, is the Primizie crisps and basil pesto sauce appetizer was good, as was the sweet roasted corn that the gnocchi was swimming in."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place randomly and instantly fell in love with it's charm, great selection & specials, amazing beer selection and very polite wait staff!

It took me way too long to get over to EAV to try it, but I'm glad I finally did. A few weekends ago, I stopped by for dinner on their patio to enjoy the nice spring weather. It was a good time to be had -- good weather, good food, good music, great service.\\n\\nFirst, I need to emphasize the great service here. Our server might be the best server of all time. Now, the first thing you need to know about me is that I'm addicted to Coke (not diet!) and I need those refills to keep on coming. My logic: I need a refill for every dollar I'm spending on the soda. I believe our server's name was Jamie and, if it's not, look for the guy with the sweet afro. Now Jamie was bringing me Cokes left and right. At any given time, I was double-fisting Cokes. Of course, he was also friendly and did a fantastic job with everything else. +1 star just for Jamie!\\n\\nOkay, onto the food! I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken hearts taco and the corn on the cob with spiced mayo and queso fresco. My friend ordered the roasted beef tongue taco, the brisket taco, and the adobe skirt steak taco. My taco tasted fine -- chicken hearts tend to be on the chewy side and it certainly was that. I wasn't blown away with it, but I wasn't upset with it either. My friend enjoyed all three of his tacos, but felt the meat was under-seasoned. Now the real winner? THE CORN ON THE COB. This was insanely delicious. The sweet corn worked so well with the mayo and the cheese, and the corn itself was grilled to perfection. I wish I had just gotten two orders of this. \\n\\nI don't know if I'm not running back, but I definitely see myself returning.

If you're simply looking for the awesome appetizer followed by killer entree and delicious desert, this is not your place. The Beast experience is equal parts anticipation and savoring of each course, socializing with your table mates (aka total strangers), and realizing you're part of a special culinary experience. As far as the wine pairing was concerned, in retrospect, I probably would not do it again. When you're getting seven kinds of wines, you're bound to not like some of them. I like a good white and a good red to see me through a meal, no matter how many courses.

Well it's simple; this is easily the worst McDonalds location I have ever visited. \\n\\nMcDonalds food has never been the pinnacle of the fast food industry. It's always cheap food that is never the best, but sometimes you just want something quick and dirty that tastes decent. McDonalds relies on being consistent with mediocre service. Unfortunately this location fails at reaching these minimal standards. \\n\\nBurgers are burnt, the chicken is rock hard, and the fries have no taste. Also, the service level is the lowest I have ever experienced. Multiple attempts at ordering from the drive thru have resulted in me waiting for at least 2 minutes with no response.

The employees don't pretend to care, and the food quality is substandard even by McDonalds levels. \\n\\nIf you have that late night crave for some quick food, check out other fast food and regular restaurants in the area that are open.

But apparently you can bypass the line out the door and go straight to the bar and order there, which I feel is unfair. I said that it was ridiculous from them to differentiate seating like that and he rudely told us we could go find seats outside. However, overhearing what was going on a nice family allowed us to sit at the unused portion of their table. Aside from the poor treatment the fries I was served were not fresh and the food was below what I expected based on previous visits, but that may have just been because I already had a bad taste in my mouth from the rude service.

Not until recently had I discovered a few places that serve tortillas with their queso and these thicker chips give all the right qualities for this basic app. Pretty standard, really.

Two choices that I normally wouldn't choose for sure, but I wanted to see what they had up their sleeves. Both were a little underwhelming. Nothing wrong, but the flavors didn't fuse together as well as they could. The lamb was really flat. The spices were only hinted at and the olives on top were kinda weak. The fried chicken was packed with slaw, which has grain mustard in it, and is a little overpowering. I was a little turned off by it. The chicken, however, was rather good. I appreciate that it was in smaller pieces instead of longer strips. \\n\\nStreet Corn. I'm a large proponent of street corn and I have to tip my hat to the presentation for theirs.

Three waitresses working, and the single guy is stuck with a waiter. If I wanted male bonding, I'll just go sit a bar. There is always that one guy looking to be someone's drinking buddy just so he can go on about his ex-wife. Which I really don't want to hear about. Especially if I am trying to eat.\\nAnyway, I ordered the corned beef sandwich on rye. Sandwiches come with a side of cole slaw and a pickle. I was able to substitute potato salad instead. The sandwich platter costs $9.79. It is extra for a side of french fries or cheese to go along with your sandwich. You have your choice of artisan breads, but I went with the rye bread. To me, any other bread just doesn't cut it. Rye bread with corned beef is it. And the corned beef was stacked high too! I have had bigger sandwiches at other delis, but this sandwich was satisfying. The meat was sliced hot, and the rye bread was fresh. With a fountain drink ($2.49), my total was $13.08. My waiter asked if I would like a refill of my drink or dessert, which I declined since I was in a hurry. But the next time I come in to TooJays, I may have to try a dessert. And if you have not been here, the desserts are showcased at the counter upon entry along with other deli offerings. And the desserts look really tempting!\\nAny time I have been to a TooJays, the food has been great, the service is always prompt, and the dining area is always clean.\\nBreakfast and dinner is served as well.

I started out with the pumpkin ravioli and had some bites of the wild boar sauces that came with broccoli rabe.

The short rib was tender, falling apart and full of flavor. Summer squash soup was smooth and light with the right amount of spice - yummy! Caesar salad was light and fresh. Fish and chips was good, and depending on what you're looking for, maybe perfect, but in my opinion it was mostly batter with little fish. The batter was puffy and crispy though!

I could make a meal out of a handful of these and a 6-pack of Taiwan Beer.  It would be a very expensive meal, since these buggers run $4 apiece at dinner.  If you charged $4 for steamed bun in China, you would either have a riot or people expecting \\"humbao stuffed with 24-karat gold\\".\\n\\n2.

The service - attentive, not overbearing, very informative and always willing to give good, useful recommendations.\\n\\nAverage, but worth a try:\\n\\n1. Chicken satay - eh... its a satay.  Its not rocket science.  Nuff said.\\n\\n2. Short rib - I think I saw some complaints about the gristle on the short ribs.  Dude, no offense, its short ribs - by definition, a cut that is close the bone will have connective tissue.  If you want a clean, sterile cut of meat, go order the filet.  However, the complaints about the fattiness are on point.  These things were flavorful, but came out on a plate swimming in their own oils.\\n\\nMisses:\\n\\n1. The spicy ramen - not going to lie, the initial aroma was of sweat-socks.  Maybe its an acquired taste.\\n\\n2.

Throw in some tomatoes, green onion, and a sprinkling of crispy fried shrimp flakes and now I know where to go for the best soup ever.\\n\\nThe prices are great, a \\"medium\\" (I have never seen a large) is a GIANT bowl I've never seen anyone finish, for $6-7. One star less for the decor, it's nothing you will ever write home about (in fact you may purposely omit it). And the fact that I can't get this (as far as I know) closer to home in Portland.

Before I start my review, I'd like to say that I understand that you don't come to Chinatown for the service but this was unacceptable. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I came here last night for dinner around 6:30PM. We were the only ones waiting and I was told the wait would be about 15-20 min so I asked if I should put my name down, the host/server said no. The space is small and we didn't want be in the way of the door so we moved outside of the entrance but not actually outside on the street. We were still visible if you look outside the door. All of a sudden, 4 parties show up, 2 groups of 2, a group of 3 and 6. A few minutes later, a few tables get up. We should have gotten a table but they seated the couple in front who was crowding the door even though they arrived after us. I figured they would have just opened the door and tell us our table was ready, nope. Then they seat the groups of 3 and 6. There was finally space for me to actually get into the restaurant. When the host/server comes, I ask him why a couple was seated when we arrived before everyone else. He says it's my fault he didn't see me. I tell him that we were standing right there if you would've just looked out the door. He continued to yell at me and blame me. Then he had the audacity to sit the other couple in front of our faces. No apology and didn't offer us the next available table. I couldn't believe it. We ended up leaving and going somewhere else.\\n\\nI've been here once before and I was happy to be able to get good quality dim sum at all hours of the day.

In fact, I have dreams about this food. Hands down the best italian food I have ever had. This is a five star restaurant without the pretentious atmosphere and high prices. All dishes are more then generous portions, pasta is made to order and ingredients are fresh. The list of specials (both appetizers and meals) seem longer then the actual menu. Great variety and extremely reasonable prices. \\nThe space is small; maybe 10-15 tables. No actual bar (though beer and wine is served) so don't expect a place to go and sit while waiting for your table. And you will wait! The first time I went, it was about two hours before we were seated. It's a long time but well worth it.  The only exception being for parties of six or more because you are then able to make a reservation. The hostess directed us to Kelly's Pub, about a block away, for drinks while we waited. This was great, and even better, Rino's will call your cell phone when your table is being set (they give you about 10 minutes to get back). Otherwise, prepare to wait standing on the street or in your car-you won't be alone!\\nThe staff here is amazing-authentic, welcoming and passionate. They work all together, so you interact with almost all of them throughout your meal.  \\nThe mozzarella and layered eggplant appetizers could have carried the  meal alone; the most amazing starters I've ever had. Then your meals arrive and you realize it just gets better. The roast pork special is delicious and cooked perfectly; chicken parmesan is tender and juicy and the lobster raviolis are out of this world. \\nThey offer a fairly unique dessert menu and is worth taking a look at. \\n\\nHaving recently moved to the west coast, when I plan my trips back home Rino's is definitely on the itinerary!

It's hard to find decent food close to a college campus, and one could depend on Chipotle to take a little care.  That seems to have ended a couple months ago.  I usually get chicken and one thing I hate about getting chicken in a restaurant is biting down into a huge chunk of cartilage.  One of the things I loved about Chipotle, is that this never happens.  Until two months ago.  I bit down on my burrito and felt the sickening squeak of inedible chicken part on my teeth.  I pulled it out and then bit down again... on another huge piece.  I'm a forgiving sort, but this nauseated me to the point that it took me over two months before I could stand the thought of eating there again. But last Monday (Feb. 17, 2014) I went back.  And by golly, there was that nauseating squeak again.   This should be a no brainer:  Cartilage is not \\"filler\\".  There are absolutely zero people in the entire world who would prefer \\"more volume by means of cartilage\\" to \\"less volume of real chicken meat.\\"  If you have to scrimp for a few pennies by tossing in some pre-pink slime, then who knows what else you're scrimping on?  \\n\\nI'm ruined on Chipotle.

I showed him my drink to prove him I ordered a large since I was never given a receipt.  When I pulled the fries out of the bag, he immediately asked \\"who gave you that?\\" He shook his head, and took our fries, dumped them and gave us brand new, just out of the friolator, large fries. I thanked him, and he told me to wait right there. He came out with these great coupons that my friend and I are really happy about. He was extremely nice and suggested we come back. \\nAt first I was really disappointed with the situation, but honestly, Scott's mature, courteous, excellent managerial skills have convinced me that this place will always deserve a second chance."},{"name":"El Pueblo Mexican Restaurant","address":"7124 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious.

Crazy traffic, to be expected. Valet parking, very welcome. The restaurant is huge, with a bar area, off-bar area, and side dining. This makes for a very cool and open look, and with large windows looking out onto the patio and streets, it breaks up the dark wood and dim lighting well. Definitely plush.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and able to answer our questions as we ordered drinks and RW choices. Appetizers (house salad, Mamma D's sausage soup) were tasty, and we were excited for our entrees to arrive, anticipating outstanding dishes. This is where the story breaks down, however. While the spouse's chicken Milanese was flavorful (crispy-fried chicken, asiago-stuffed gnocchi with a sweet pepper cream sauce), my mahi-mahi was a bit like eating a soft, dense sponge - not recommended. Once out of orzo and mango-pineapple salsa, my course was over. During our meal, we were served by various and sundry staff, who seemed to be a mix of runners, hostesses and other wait staff, as well as our ordering server. It felt chaotic, hurried, and tough to get the attention of any one person. We are super low-maintenance, and it was easy to tell that being that way left us unattended. This came to a head when dessert was served. A few minutes following the clearing of our plates and ordering coffee, our desserts were dropped off and we were left with mouths open and hands up for a) forks and b) our requested coffee. Instead, we were left with one spoon to share between our two lackluster sweets and our coffee arrived with the check.\\n\\nEasily, dinner could have merited three stars if the details had been executed (check in at the start of the entree course, dessert forks and coffee). Also, had we realized that the RW portions were smaller than the regular menu, we would have happily spent the difference for full menu options. Our server was vocally surprised that my fish was a \\"full portion\\" and looked a bit worried about that. Maybe I saved another diner from spongy fish fail, who knows.

The very first trip here was not a great experience BUT they were only open for a week and with a family owned and family operated business, there is bound to be a few kinks. We gave them about a month to work out the challenges and went back. The food had been consistently good ever since.\\n\\nLast week I was looking at places I have not been to since I started Yelping and saw China Wok. I was actually surprised there were only a few reviews and when I read them I was surprised that they were inconsistent and only a few. Well it has been a while since I was last there so I wondered if the place had slipped since my last visit and today I was in the mood for some hot n sour soup again!\\n\\nUsually my wife just stops for some takeout because they have a small dining area and are really setup for takeout. I chose to dine in so I could see first hand what was up. When I walked in, everything was just as I remembered it including the young lady that always works the register. She just happens to be the owner's daughter and is always very personable. I ordered a small hot n sour soup, spring rolls, Singapore Chow Mei Fun and a bottle of water. \\n\\nThe total came to $13.75 \\n\\nSince I was being kind of indecisive with my order, it was no surprise my order came out a piece at a time because they are really geared for take out and I know that. First out was the hot n sour soup and it was piping hot. That first spoon was just as I remembered it so our course I had to see if my fried noodles were crispy or soggy. It was pretty apparent that these were recently fried because they were NOT stale at all. One thing I hate is stale fried noodles with my soup. The soup itself has a nice balance of hot and sour and as usual it has the SAME flavor. Another pet peeve of mine is when the hot n sour soup varies in flavor trip to trip but never here!\\n\\nNext out was the spring rolls...  Light and crispy on the outside and an flavorful filling on the inside. The ONLY difference is they were VERY hot because I was dining in and not getting them after a 10 minute trip home in the car. As I was finishing my spring rolls up, the Singapore Chow Mei Fun arrived. I have had Singapore Chow Mei Fun years back while on business in San Francisco. My client took me to a place in China Town that served up some of the best Chinese food I have ever had I have to say that if it was on a fancy plate in a posh setting with a garnish and NOT in a take out container...  You would not have been able to tell the difference...  WELL DONE is what I have to say...  It also did not cost $45 and that was back in 1997. \\n\\nFor OVERALL food TASTE - 5 (TASTE is KEY)\\nFor dining ATMOSPHERE - 3 (It is a take out joint so what did you expect)\\nFor SERVICE - 5 (Great customer service and a smile go a long way)\\n\\nBONUS - She actually remembered my wife by her order and described her to me. I was actually surprised by that because we rarely go there together. \\n\\nIn the past I have had the General Tso and it was very good but I would have liked a wee bit more heat in it. The Moo Goo Gai Pan which was perfect in my opinion. The Shrimp with lobster sauce just needed a wee bit of salt for me but that is what soy sauce is for anyway. The Sesame chicken was off the chain good. The bourbon chicken was also very good. \\n\\nThe ONLY complaint I truly had tonight was that the soy sauce bottle on the table was almost empty but again...  What do you expect in a place that does 90% take out? Nobody's perfect but the food WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU!"},{"name":"4 Locos Tacos","address":"360 W Plant St","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"3.5","text":"A very nice place to grab a taco or 4 before grabbing a beer at crooked can.

Great sandwiches (though a little on the expensive side ~$10 for just a turkey club on two slices of bread with nothing, not even a bag of chips).  Breakfast is good.  I love their French Toast which I think they give too much (but I'm not complaining).  Bacon is typically good and so are the home fries.

The cuisine, however, is a little meh. Everything I tried between my boyfriend and myself (Duck confit, apple bruschetta, stuffed peppers, pork empanada, and pumpkin spice tiramisu) was overly sweet. I love sweet stuff! Love it! I just don't really enjoy it when it's with flavors that don't really mix, like a dry blue cheese or meat. (Years of Coca-Cola Ham at Christmas weaned me off ever liking sweet meat.) I think the pork empanadas went better with the sauce on my duck confit, too. \\n\\nWhat confuses me most of all, is the combination of flavors. I like trying unique combinations, but I didn't really enjoy the combinations together. I felt that the chef who designed the menu is a taster, not a supertaster, who enjoys very, very sweet things. I was literally confused by the flavor combinations in the tiramisu. There's something citrus-y in the pumpkin tiramisu, and I don't find pumpkin mixes well with citrus. (I did like the pumpkin bits itself, just not whatever citrus bits were in there.) \\n\\nService was completely fine, and I have nothing to complain about there.

I am VERY disappointed with the service.  I have been to Atasca many times before and enjoyed their food.  Unfortunately, last night was the WORST experience we have had at a restaurant ever.\\nWe had a group of 11 people , in order to seat us -the restaurant said they could split the group in two which was perfectly fine by us in order to not have to wait to eat.  As soon as we sat down , our waiter asked us how we were doing and mentioned he would be bringing some water.  We proceeded to ask if it was possible to sit at a different table - which was closer to our friends' table (the restaurant was pretty empty).  Our waiter, very rudely and with a lot of attitude, said \\"well you should've made a reservation!\\" We were shocked.  He could have easily said \\"I'm sorry we can't do that for you\\". And we would've been fine with the response but no.  So of course, we went to ask our friends at the other table if they wanted to stay since our dinner experience had already started off poorly.  While we were discussing options, the manager came and very rudely and impatiently said \\" are you guys leaving? Because we can use the tables\\". I looked around to see that the restaurant was still empty and there weren't any lines of people waiting to be seated.  We told the manager that the only reason we were considering leaving is because his waiter was rude to us.  He said \\" oh That's Ben, and I know Ben.  Ben is just being Ben. Please make up your mind if you are leaving or not\\"\\n\\nEveryone was feeling uncomfortable and we decided to go to Moksa (located on Mass Ave).  Where they accommodated us and provided Excellent service.  I am still shocked and embarrassed for thinking of bringing my friends to this once beloved Portuguese restaurant.

I'd been to Mezzo once previously but not for several years. Props to my boyfriend because it was the perfect place for a romantic Valentine's date! It was not extremely crowded but I think that was due to the winter storm raging through Ohio. However, for us winter warriors, it was well worth facing the cold! The ambiance was perfect...from the romantic, soft lighting to the cosy little corner we were seated in. Our server was friendly, attentive, and professional...this clearly was not his first rodeo.\\nNow for the food! We ordered the mussels to start....the mussels themselves were cooked to perfection! But let me tell you about the sauce they were cooked in...I'm no foodie so forgive my terminology but HOT D*MN!!! It was absolutely amazing and full of flavor. If my boyfriend and I hadn't been together for almost a year, I would have been embarrassed to consume it, along with almost all our bread in front of him!\\nMain course: I ordered the lamb dish. Mostly because I just love lamb...but also because I'd never heard of it being prepared like this! It had an delicious glaze with cherries and olives. AHH-MAZ-ING! My boyfriend ordered the pork in a Smoked Pancetta Truffle Sauce with the truffle fries. He was in absolute love with his meal, I had to fight him for a bite! However, I more or less forced him to order the truffle fries. And I was not disappointed with them, neither was he, well the ones he actually got to eat! Clean plate club...hollaaaaa!\\nAfter we finished we told our waiter to give our compliments to the chef. Five minutes later...Tom, the sous chef at Mezzo, came out to talk with us. He literally sat down at our table and carried on a conversation with us! Tom was super relatable and nice. It was so cool that he took the time to come out and talk to us! And a lot of the reason I am taking the time to write this review. Before he went back to the kitchen, we asked him about recommendations for dessert. He suggested the blondie with vanilla ice cream.\\nDessert: Naturally, we went with Tom's recommendation, the blondie. Not gonna lie, it wouldn't have been my first choice bc it reminds me of my moms, which aren't exactly something to write home about. I'm so glad that we took his advice because despite my stomach aching at this point we managed to clean that plate as well...\\nDefinitely one of my best restaurant experiences to date!

The interior didn't really look like anything. The outside deck was about the same.

We had two separate wait-staff help us, and a staff member who seemed to be a manager came around to make sure everything was good. \\n\\nThe plates of food were large, especially for the price.

Our first inclination was to bolt after the rude interaction with the main server. We had a reservation for the 8:45 pm seating. You are instructed to arrive at 8:30 which we did only to be told that they were running behind and to come back at 9pm.  We headed next door for drinks and appetizers since we came ready to eat at 8:45pm.  Next door is an Izakaya which was a pretty awesome find. After the abrupt greeting, we just wanted to stay and have dinner. Oh....but I left my CC with our reservation.  9 pm rolls around and we promptly return only to be told they are running behind. Again.  I asked how much longer, since they were running behind before and we weren't really going to wait much longer.  We finally get seated at 9:15.  I gave this restaurant a star since the presentation of the food was well prepared (yes, that's the equivalent of telling your best friend that your blind date was , \\"nice\\")  and it did taste good.  The problem that I have with this restaurant beside the initial interaction is that the restaurant is called BEAST and I expect to eat a bunch of meat.  The food cost for our meal probably topped out at around $15 per person.  Not only that, but we had already had appetizers and drinks next door and we were nowhere FULL.

The owners had always been on the premises at the old location - the husband in the kitchen and wife on the floor. But they went unseen this day, nor did I recognize any of the staff. Very bad decision to trust their restaurant in employees' hands!\\n\\nOnly people who finished their meals were the two friends who ordered curry shrimp. Two friends sent back their brown stew tofu and jerk tofu plates practically untouched, and my sister-in-law, 9 months pregnant, left more than half a plate of jerk wings untouched.

When I asked the waitress for salt for my near-raw, unseasoned \\"chop suey\\" (everyone else's looked cooked and had seasoning - turned out the only seasoning used was pepper) she instead brought me a large bowl of peppered cabbage - no salt on that either! A friend described the food best as \\"spicy sticks and euro-cabbage\\"!\\n\\nAnd it wasn't just the food...\\nIn the end, our waitress (who WAS nice as can be) took literally an hour to distribute each individual bill with a separate trip to the table asking us person by person \\"now what'd you get\\", and took even longer to bring everyone's change keeping my $1.60 in coin change on top of her already paid gratuity. Then after all that she sent the manager over to say \\"some of you left without paying\\". So I had to serve him with an explanation that the waitress never wrote down any of our 14 orders, she never cancelled one of the orders that was sent back to the kitchen, and she didn't include any of our appetizers (yucca/cassava fries) on our original entree bill. So upon hearing there were yucca fries that went unpaid for, I paid for mine right then and told him I already paid for my entree and the yucca fries weren't on that ticket.

She displayed the epitome of excellent service. I would give this place 5 stars for service alone because of her!\\n\\nThe standard flavors are great (try the almond brittle!), but I recommend trying the monthly specials. They use fresh, local ingredients in the flavors and the ones for July were centered around berries. At first glance, you might find some of the flavors intimidating or weird (goat cheese marionberry habanero? fresh cheese & strawberries?), but they all somehow work AMAZINGLY.

An on-stage grill is a prominent feature in the colorful dining room.\\n\\nThe restaurant offers healthy bowls that are customizable. You can start with a base of quinoa and vegetable salad; red and sweet potato hash; mixed whole-grain and rice or romaine and kale salad. Next is either wood-grilled chicken (straight from the on-display grill), slow-roasted beef, sustainable fish or chili-spiced fried tofu. And the bowl is finished with charred onion chimichurri, black bean vinaigrette or creamy herb dressing.\\n\\nThe menu also offers steamed \\"pods\\" - bao buns with either cheeseburger ingredients or vegetable curry served with root vegetable chips and crunchy vegetable slaw. We also experienced something coming to the menu soon, Satu'li Feast. A feast for both the eyes and palate, this impressive board was equally tasty and healthy. A fun way to experience a variety of flavors with a group!\\n\\nSatu'li Canteen is the first Disney restaurant to offer Mobile Order, a new convenient option to order and pay for meals on-the-go using the My Disney Experience app. The service enables guests to bypass the queue to order when they arrive at the restaurant.

It came out Hot, very hot, and seemed soooo good. Service was fast.. I started out with the tamales, which were very very good, but then again, it's been ages since I'd had one. Tender, hot, and warm. Chicken.\\n\\nNext came the tacos, which came with double soft shells which I enjoyed, though, I'll admit the tortillais were not the freshest....they were good, but they didnt taste like they were made that hour. The meat inside was a bit rough, and pulled out everytime I bit down. The tomatoes were very fresh though. The hot sauce was also a delight.\\n\\nSo now the yummy tamales and the \\"ok\\" tacos had been devoured. The enchiladas were left which i read and heard about from YELP.. In short, the meat inside was very tender and tasty, but again, the shell/tortilla didnt seem that soft, fresh. otherwise, it was the best of the 3, but very close to the tamales.\\n\\nOverall, for the price of the food, this place is awesome! I wanted to give it a 3.5, but decided on a 3 cause I've had better mexican food around town, ole mexican, though the price is 2x. I'm a picky foodie, and cant give 4-5's to every place i eat.

The collard greens were way to oily and lacked that fresh taste, even after I added hot sauce it was way too much oil to save. The mac and cheese was so-so. I feel like its hard to mess up mac and cheese and Im also not crazy about breadcrumbs and those were caked on. The biscuits & fried chicken bucket is enough for 4 so that was a great deal and after you add honey, the biscuits were really good.

However, we set at the family style table and boy oh boy did they mean family style. We were cramped in like sardines, people had to move purses, cups, some left before even placing their order, and at one point the girl next to me drank my water on accident because we were so close. They were piling parties of 2-4 next to one another rather than across just to squeeze people in and while people were happy to be seated it was a very uncomfortable setting and way to close. We ended up not finishing our meal because there was just no space, and after we kept getting things packed away to make room, it was barely any food on the table. At one point the manager asked why we were getting rid of the sauces and I stated that the table was too crowded, he looked but didnt seem fazed and didnt acknowledge that people were obviously getting annoyed.

The pasta was cooked to perfection and their bolognese sauce is amazing. Very thick meaty gravy style sauce. Also, the carrot cake, which is very reasonable priced is delicious. Bread and oil is amazing and their is freshly (and I mean freshly) grated Parmesan always on your table. Oh and their house red wine is a MUST. I have never had a bad meal here. Beware their meals are very filling.Their are some servers you recognize that are outstanding and very catering and others are just average. \\n\\nThis restaurant is very small and while I would say it needs to expand it seems to want to stay this way. You would often miss it if you were driving by. It definitely does need to expand it's hours as it seems they are often closed or limiting their hours. The place gets very busy.\\n\\nThe reason I knock off a star is the noise. You need to know this place is VERY VERY loud. It is not the place to have a private get together or meeting. The tables are very close together in a very small space and it is always very busy. I have never been to a restaurant this loud. In one of the more notable visits a group of four was sitting near us practically yelling at each other. Many people were looking over at them clearly annoyed and having to talk over them to hear their own conversations. With costs this high I was really hoping a waiter would at least go over to them and ask them to quite down slightly due to all the people around them, I don't think that is too much to ask. If you are going to go here be aware of the noise and perhaps try to keep your own conversations at a normal level so that maybe other groups will do the same.\\n\\nIf you love Italian food I highly recommend this place."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"12553 State Rd, Ste 535","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here for sentimental reasons.

It was amazing! It was oozing salty Sao Jorge cheese in a linguica and wine sauce that was buttery, rich, meaty, and complex. It was also served with an excellent broccoli rabe risotto which I could have eaten bowls of, It was all packed with flavor and really well seasoned, but almost bordering on too salty. Luckily, I like salty, but it might be a problem for some. \\n\\nRoommate got the Atasca Shrimp, served with a spicy tomato sauce and these really awesome thick potato slices that were also salty goodness. They should serve them with every dish.\\n\\nOverall everything was a bit rich and salty but very hearty, filling, and home-made feeling.

Not only was I able to easily book a reservation for a Friday night, but we had fantastic service and pretty darn good grub. Being a sports bar there were lots of tvs and sports memorabilia around, but surprisingly they were playing music videos. I thought that was kinda cool. The music playing was not that of the videos, but some really good classic jams. Classics from the 80's, 90's and 2000's on a Friday night and I dug it.\\nI was happy with our seats, I was comfortable. We were initially seated by the windows, which were open. Normally I would rave about this, however, people were smoking right outside the bar and I don't particularly care to eat my food with smoke. I subtract a star for this. Smoking should be prohibited from outside the bar. Sorry guys, move down the street away from the windows, because you are ruining it for the rest of us.\\n\\nSERVICE! I should have caught her name, but our server was awesome! Attentive, quick and helpful! I asked for her opinion on food and drinks. She was knowledgeable with the menu and honest. I am a wino....anyone who reads my reviews knows this! ;)\\nShe told me straight up not to order the house red blend because if I really like wine it just wouldn't do. Unfortunately, there were only two options for red wine, so I went with the other one lol. I won't hold it against Yagger's because I haven't been to many sports bars that give two hoots about wine so...A bottle of Alamos Malbec it was!!! $30 for the bottle, which is worth it if you are having a few or sharing. Otherwise its $8/glass. I did initially try the Crown Black Old Fashion for $10.43. it was a 2 ounce drink, but it didn't taste strong enough for my liking.  My \\"WOW\\" moment with the service was when the server pretty much cured some significant heartburn one of the guests at our table was having. Apparently if you down a glass of Club soda with a lot of bitters, bye bye heart burn. She offered it up, served it up, and didn't charge anything for it. Awesome!!! I also really liked that our server seemed genuine and like she was having fun!!!\\n\\nFOOD! For starters we ordered the artichoke and cauliflower bites. Oh you gotta try these little tasty treats. The artichokes were very light seasoned and flash fried. Just the right amount of salty, the perfect hint of lime and POW!!!! Totally Yum! The cauliflower were deep fried and covered in this sweet and spicy concoction.....Hai Korean hot sauce. If you like spicy, order it! $11.99 and a decent size. There were so many tasty things to order on the menu, I had a hard time deciding what to order. We went with the Chicken Fajitas to share for $18.49 plus another $3.49 for Guac. A bit steep I thought, but the server said they were quite large. Well, this girl can eat a lot and I was sharing, so really it wasn't that much. Its really only enough for one hungry person. The Spicy Baha Chicken Fajitas with mixed vegetables were wonderful, but they didn't provide enough toppings for the shells. Cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, sour cream and pico de gallo were all crowded in one small dish. Simply, there was not enough for the price and not enough in proportion to the chicken, and definitely not enough if you are sharing. Other than that they were wonderful. We asked for two more soft taco shells and we were not changed (bonus). The Grilled Chicken Mango Wrap was ordered by the table and I got to eat half of that. It was a HUGE for $14.99, but I was very disappointed in this wrap. The mango was terrible. I love mango for its sweetness and the mango in the wrap tasted like it was soaked in vinegar, yuck! The side salad that came with the wrap was fantastic!! Yes, i ate that as well ;)  Blue cheese, seeds, dried fruit....what a power little side salad!!! I feel like this dish could be amazing if they just fix whatever the heck is going on with their mango!!\\n\\nI will definitely return to this local watering hole as it has some strong points, but I do hope some improvements are made.

We absolutely loved the place and the food (especially the chicken and dumplings - perfection) - it's part of the reason I loved this neighborhood so much and was so excited when I found a place up the street. When my mom came down last weekend to visit I was so excited to take her to Tasty and Sons for an early Mother's Day dinner. The drinks, as always, were incredible, as were the dates and cauliflower. Things unfortunately went a bit off the rails, however - the bar was either really backed up or lost my second drink order, and one of our pieces of quail was significantly undercooked. I was super bummed, especially because I was so excited to show off one of my new fave neighborhood restaurants to my mom and have a nice girls night out. Fortunately, the team and Tasty and Sons completely saved the day and did absolutely everything right in redeeming our experience. That missing drink? As they dropped it off at the table they told me it was comped. That undercooked quail? The chef sent his apologies.... AND two desserts on the house (in addition to taking the quail off the bill) to make up for it and ensure we had an awesome end to our meal. Which we did. That Samoa ice cream? We are STILL talking about it! So impressed with this place and will absolutely be back soon.

I know a lot people who like it and it does a lot of lunch time business, but it needs to be brought down a notch.  If I had the option to give it 2.5 stars, I would.  I give it three because the service is above average in terms of wait time.  It is about 3 to 4 minutes, not including waiting to be taken in line, up to the point where they are  handing you the food.  It all depends how much is on the sandwhich and what branch you are at, so don't hold me to that.  I suggest you try everything else before you try this place.

I had the gnocchi which were light and fluffy and not the typically heavy little rocks you get in most restaurants. I also tasted my husbands rigatoni and the homemade pasta tasted great and was cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back. I want to try the bresaola, the frutti di mare, and the matriaciana.

The restaurant offered a small special tasting menu for those with the coupons. My meal was fine, but nothing memorable. Boyfriend described it as the \\"worst restaurant meal I've ever had.\\"\\n\\nThe waitstaff was inattentive and annoying. Our waiter kept making fun of us - Oh, monsieur is not having fun? Madame is not enjoying her dinner? No, not particularly, because we haven't seen you in 30 minutes and are ready for our next course.\\n\\nApps were pretty standard salads. Again, mine was not memorable and Boyfriend's had a strange dressing that tasted bad with the rest of the salad. I wish I remembered what it was to advise others against it.\\n\\nFor entrees, Boyfriend got the bluefish, which he was so excited about. I make bluefish all the time - I know it's considered a junky fish, but we both love the strong flavor and it's a huge favorite when cooked at home. As a recent convert, he had never had it at a restaurant. The portion was tiny and he didnt even finish it. He told me that I cook it way better.\\n\\nI got the chicken coq au vin which I had never had before. It was tasty and I'm glad I tried it, but it was a little heavy and oily. Nothing to write home about.\\n\\nThe dessert. Oh, the dessert. What a fiasco. We finished our meals, our plates were cleared, and we waited 35 minutes for our waiter to return with our dessert menu. At the same time, we saw him visit a table of 6 2-3 times. Our Deal Meal came with dessert, but after a while boyfriend really wanted to get the check and leave without dessert. I wanted to get the meal to which we were entitled. We ended up getting a few nice sorbets but I wish I had left at boyfriend's suggestion.

Most of the places here serve pre-made dimsum in carts -- something you'll never see in Hong Kong today (it's always freshly made-to-order there). So after learning that Winsor offers made-to-order dimsum, I was doubly excited and decided to give Winsor a try. I was, however, incredibly disappointed. \\n\\nFirst, the shrimps in both the \\"ha gau\\" (shrimp dumplings) and \\"ha cheung\\" (shrimp rice rolls) were completely overcooked. Since these were supposedly made-to-order, I was expecting perfectly cooked shrimps -- crunchy, firm, and crisp. But these were the exact opposite. They were totally mushy. It almost seems as though they had been pre-cooked and were just re-steamed before serving. They did not taste fresh at all and were significantly worse than the shrimp dumplings at Hei La Moon and Chow Chow.\\n\\nSecond, the shrimps were not deveined at all. I had to use my finger to grab the veins out. After seeing all the gross black stuff stuck in my fingernails, I was so grossed out I could barely eat the dumpling :(  My boyfriend was so grossed out when he saw all the black stuff on my nails that he almost puked. I ate one piece and left all the rest in the basket. If you enjoy shrimp dumplings and shrimp rice rolls, go to Chow Chow instead. Theirs is the best, with large perfectly cooked crunchy shrimps and delicious thick black sauce for the \\"ha cheung\\").\\n\\nThird, the pork spareribs were not tender. The key to making great spareribs is to make sure that they are cut into small bite-sized pieces and to make sure that they achieve the right \\"done-ness\\" needed to break down the muscle fibers and connective tissues of the pork. Not only were the spareribs cut in chunks that were too big (I could barely fit them in my mouth), it seems they were also not cooked at the right temperature or were not cooked long enough. On top of that, the black bean sauce was also not that tasty. If you like spareribs, the pork spareribs at Hei La Moon tops the charts for me here in Boston.\\n\\nFourth, the siu mai (shrimp and pork dumplings) was totally dry and did not taste freshly made at all. If you are a siu mai fan, go to Hei La Moon. They have the best siu mai in Chinatown.\\n\\nFifth, the siu long bao (soup dumplings) were a total disappointment too. The skin was way too thick and there was not enough soup inside the dumpling. \\n\\nFinally, the kook fah or chrysanthemum tea was completely tasteless. Any respectable dim sum place should have at least decent tea. You can tell just by looking at its super pale color -- even without sipping it -- that it would be bland. The tea here is similar to the really ugly and cheap chrysanthemum tea that you get at Super 88. Both Hei La Moon and Chow Chow serve infinitely better chrysanthemum tea.\\n\\nIf you are craving for dim sum, go to Hei La Moon instead. Or Chow Chow. Sure, they are nowhere near as good as the average dimsum places in Hong Kong or California, but unfortunately these two are already the best Boston has to offer."},{"name":"Filippo Ristorante","address":"283 Causeway St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Good good and real good service.

The layout of this place was pretty traditional with a large dinning area with a standard size bar near the entrance. On that night, we ordered Lobster, Crab & Avocado appetizer to share, Veal Piccata, Milf Fed Ossobuso and Tiramisu for dessert. The Lobster, Crab & Avocado appetizer had a great presentation and that was the only good thing about the dish. The lobster and crab mix was good but I can tell there are more crab meat than lobster meat. The avocado mixed was bland and it was not a great pair with the meat. The whole dish tasted like expensive baby food and I rather ordered a salad instead. The Veal Piccata was pretty good. The veal meat was tender but the sauce was too sour for my liking. The Ossobuso was good in taste, the meat was fork-tender but it was expensive when it was presented a basic Italian veal stew ($44, really?). The sides for both dishes were lukewarm and not good in taste either. As for the Tiramisu, it was ok in taste. The dessert was liked it was frozon and flawed to serve (The sponge cake was too wet and the cream was melting).

Menu order dim sum that you can get at all times of the day and night?  Sounds great right?  The convenience of Winsor is one of the highlights.  However the menu  ordering just isn't the same.  Part of the dim sum experience is the carts and not knowing what's coming.  The dim sum cart pushers aren't going to try to sell their items to you here and you may be missing out on something great because you don't see it.  Menu ordering is also tough because there are a lot of great dim sum items and many can be found on the menu here. Even during the middle of the week there can be 50+ dim sum items. \\n\\nThe food itself is pretty good. It's not the same level as dim sum in the middle of a busy weekend rush (we came for dinner). Dumpling skins were chewy indicating they were probably sitting around too long that day, or maybe longer.  Either that or they were over cooked.  The fillings were really good though. My favorite was the spicy salty squid.  This was fresher than other items we ordered, had great flavors and wasn't chewy.  \\n\\nPrice wise, it's a bargain, especially for dinner.  We had 6 dishes for 26$ (tax included). Most dishes are $3.45 while specials like the squid could cost more.

Even heartwarming. \\n\\nThe Bar One has classic sports bar fare like burgers and wings, with fun stuff like chicken curry thrown in. That menu is a little more pricey but also nice. You can sit on either side of the restaurant and get both menus.\\n\\nPlus, being a sporty place, they have great game day specials like $4.00 Caesars and Coors Light. Since they have a full bar, they can make you just about anything. Not a lot of selection for wines, though!\\n\\nThe one odd thing - you don't get so much attention from the waitstaff (even during slow times). We've been here several times and they always forget to give us cutlery. And when they bring our coffee around, we never have napkins or stir sticks. \\n\\nBut if you want (fairly) cheap food and drink (especially for Vancouver!!), this is an awesome, clean, fun place to hang out!

This was a steal for $6 on their happy hour and it definitely was one of the best salads I've ever had. The $4 Panna cotta was perfect, with caramel apples and toasted pecans - luscious, creamy, and not too sweet. I'd pass on the potatoes bravas - underwhelming and some potatoes were not cooked thoroughly.

It was wrapped in double layers of this soft taco with a a slightly burnt taste. You have to be careful when biting into the taco. The juices will gush out. Maybe this is why there is two layer of soft taco? In my opinion, too much soft taco and the burnt taste makes the taco taste even more dry. The lamb was a bit gamey in this dish and I didn't quite enjoyed it as much. The lime didn't help either. Maybe a crunchy taco would have been better? \\n\\nThe second dish we tried was the shrimp and grits with mushroom. I thought my husband was silly to order this entree but it turned out to be the best dish of the night. Everything was cooked perfectly. I love the buttery taste of the grits, goes well with the saltiness of the shrimp, and the earthiness of the mushrooms. Well balanced dish. \\n\\nHowever, the dish that drew me to this restaurant was the spicy goat stew. As it turned out, this dish was absolutely delicious. The only complaint I had was the taste of the goat meat was very noticeable. I mean, I know I am eating goat meat and it tasted just as it should but for some reason, I was hoping the goat would not taste like goat meat but that is silly of me.

The 78756 and The Crestview were very flavorful while The Travis Heights was a bit bland and came with Swiss, despite my order. My husband's burger was slightly cold and came with the wrong fries. My brother ordered the Highland Hills Chicken Sandwich and said it definitely had a kick. The fried green beans were a huge hit and the kids meals were more than enough in size.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. This was definitely better than our first experience here. I'm pretty sure we will be back."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"One of our favorite places.. these guys are fast, affordable and most important, tasty as all get out...

But I had heard good things about Eastside Pies and a few colleagues allowed me to steal a slice of their pizza when they ordered from EP, so I thought it would be a reliable place. \\n\\nBut oh dear.  \\n\\nIn early April, my boyfriend ordered a pizza from Eastside Pies. I was working late that evening and we can't really trust him to make edible foods in the kitchen. He ordered the pizza at 8:20. I got home around 9:30 and the pizza had still not made it to our place. Being that it was a Friday night and we figured they would be busy, we thought we would give them a little more time to get the food to us. \\n\\nAn hour passed and no pizza. \\n\\nMy boyfriend called Eastside Pies and they stated that they had written his address and phone number down incorrectly but would get the pizza to us as quickly as possible. 10:45 rolls around and the delivery man shows up with the pizza and a few apology brownies that we were half-expecting to be laced with something. \\n\\nAt this point we were ravenous and we proceeded to open the box, eagerly ready to eat. I'm not sure enough disgusting and horrified words accurately describe the vomitous hunk of charred food that laid before us. Biting into the crust was like biting into glass - I was a bit concerned that one of us would be impaled with shards of crust. In all honesty, it looked like they had taken the pizza we had ordered and put it back in the oven to heat it, rather than just making us a whole new pie. It was charred. It was horrible. And it cost over $30 to eat what pretty much amounted to firewood. \\n\\nSo very terrible and very awful experience that unfortunately could not even be improved by the apology brownies. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I really struggled with whether or not to post such a poor review, but we had such a negative experience with this business that I don't think we'll ever be back."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"2114 New Slaughter","city":"Austin","stars":"1.5","text":"Yeah I get it.

Here are a few ways:\\n\\n1) If you have a party of 6 or more, you can make an actual reservation.  But the catch is that you have to call at exactly the right time on exactly the right day when their reservation book opens up for the following month (I don't remember the day or time, so call the restaurant to make sure).  Expect all the group reservations to be sold out within an hour, and possibly much quicker.\\n\\nI celebrated my birthday here a couple of years ago, and I made the reservation myself.  As it turned out, rather inconveniently, I was sitting in an airport bar waiting for my flight to board when the phone line opened up.  So a friend and I simultaneously speed dialed Rino's over and over and over, I'm guessing ~120 times over 10 minutes between the two of us, until we got lucky and grabbed one of the last remaining reservations.  LOL, if you are motivated enough, it's really not that hard!\\n\\n2) Alternatively, you can wait in line outside the restaurant.  Of course, you might be waiting 2-3 hours before they call to say your table is ready.  As you can see from other Yelp reviews, sometimes you might not even get in!\\n\\nIf you try this approach, take my advice and bring along a couple of bottles of wine.  While Rino's won't let you drink them, if you get tired of waiting in line, you can head across the street to 300 Saratoga Cafe, which just happens to be Boston's only LEGAL byob restaurant (also Italian).\\n\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/300-saratoga-cafe-boston\\n\\n3) Finally, try going for a late mid-week lunch.  At 1:50PM on a very cold and blustery day in April (so perhaps everyone stayed home), we walked right in to a half-full restaurant.\\n\\nPersonally, while Rino's serves well-made, fresh and tasty \\"red sauce\\" Italian-style cooking, there's no way I'm waiting 2+ hours in line for it.\\n\\nStreet parking can be a challenge.  But it's only a 10-15 minute Uber ride from the North End.\\n\\nGood luck!"},{"name":"Stir It Up","address":"84 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Been dying to go here.

And we made sure to tell her many times that this wasn't her fault and the manager should have come to address us. Atmosphere=good. We had an issue. Informed the waitress that we were using a Loaf Deal. $12 for $25. She redeemed it, then returned to tell us the management (sitting down, garishly looking over her shoulder at us periodically) said we couldn't combine happy hour specials with the deal. Ok. We were then offered to pay FULL price for our food and use the deal that way. Are you still with me? Then the check was returned w a tip added. Guess what? The Loaf Deals excludes the tip! So they're making their own rules now? Tried to pay with Amex. They don't accept that. So we paid w a different card.

Too many of the staff at this location are either poorly trained or are just completely unmotivated to really help out the customer that the experience blows. I literally had an employee say \\"I don't know maybe in Dairy?\\" To a question I had about a product and then she turned around and walked the other way.  The staff ant King Soopers seem to be trained differently and are at least able to fake interest in helping the customer. The turnover seems to be less there too. Not a good sign at all! \\n\\nI find that the organic produce at King Soooers to be better and more abundant, the speciality items too expensive and Pharmaca has all the same supplements and health products with more informed and friendlier staff.

Thick bacon, fresh biscuit, and not overly-sweet honey butter.  We also got a side of fresh-made apricot-cinnamon jam and strawberry-raspberry jam.  Ten minutes later my breakfast came out - a British breakfast, which consisted of 2 over easy eggs, baked beans, a roasted tomato, and a home-made English muffin.  The whites of the eggs weren't fully cooked, but the baked-beans were phenomenal.  The English muffin with the jam, was my favorite part of the meal.  My brother-in-law's meal came out 10 minutes after mine, which was a cheese-steak sandwich.  By this point, we were all frustrated with the food timing.  We were not alerted that food came as it was ready - had the menu said \\"family style\\" or had our waitress said this, we would have ordered differently.  However, this was not posted anywhere, which made for a disconnected meal.  Overall, the food was pretty good - nothing as outstanding as I've had in Portland before, but it was good.

I loved the sticky rice that came with it on the side and the fried shallots on top for garnish. \\n\\nWe also had the brisket curry. Fair warning, super spicy! I love places like this that don't skimp on the heat to cater to American tastes: they keep it real. \\n\\nLastly, we had some roti on the side. These like the chicken tasted very fresh. The bread was delightfully crunchy on the outside with some chewiness on the inside, and just a hint of sweetness at the end. Honestly, it was a lot like something my mom would make. \\n\\nI loved that this place felt authentic and humble. The food came out fast and very fresh."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Boston. The pork buns, shark fin dumplings, shrimp & edamame special, fried tofu, and all the soups have been fantastic so far. The seating is not ideal, and you may have to share a table--but this way you can scope out other people's food since it's pretty much impossible to predict what you'll get based on the menu descriptions. \\n\\nI'd recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and likes dim sum.

The food was great.  Instead of trying some of their fancier dishes (they have a range of southern dishes not just the fat fried stuff you see most places) we went full glutton.  We ended up with their basket of fried chicken and a slab of ribs.  This also came with a few biscuits.  We couldn't resist trying the mac and cheese either.  The fried chicken was spot on (probably the best I've had in Boston). We found the seasoning in the breading to be addictive, nicely salted and peppered. Didn't need a sauce.  The ribs were good and satisfying.  Biscuits don't live up to Sweet Cheeks fame but got the job done.  The butter and jam they provide really elevate the biscuits to being pretty damned good.  Mac and cheese was gooey and featured a pasta you wouldn't normally see but worked really well in the dish.  My wife thinks she's a sweet tea connoisseur spending part of her life down south. This sweet tea is her favorite that she's had up north (that's saying something).  Service was a bit of miss a few months after their initial opening.  The place was crazy hectic on a Saturday night but the staff didn't help.  The staff is literally running around here trying to keep up.  I appreciate the promptness of the staff and the effort, but this made for a fast paced and hectic dining experience.  It was difficult to relax and enjoy ourselves being swamped by service staff and seeing them run by our table over 100 times.  Just slow down a bit! Everything is slower in the south!  \\n\\nI saw the chicken and waffles and I must come back as their fried chicken was my favorite thing here on this visit.

The wait staff is courteous and they speak english well (in dim sum terms, at least). Also, this place is an extraordinary bargain. Unfortunately, you don't really get the full dim sum experience here. \\n\\nUnlike the big dim sum halls, such as the China Pearl, there are no carts circulating. Instead, you are provided a card, which lists the various menu items, and a pencil. You check off your desired dishes, hand it to the nearest waiter and it is brought to the kitchen. And therein lies the problem: when going for dim sum, what truly excites me is the prospect of an obscure-food safari!\\n\\nWhen I think dim sum, visions of cold, inarticulate, Chinese waitresses, pulling up to my table with carts of mystery food, dance in my brain. The routine typically goes: a waitress pushes a steam-cart up to my table and rattles off the name of the dish(es) within. She immediately recognizes the befuddled expression on my face. Knowing full well that visual aides tend to expedite the ordering process with western imperialist customers such as myself, she reaches into her cart with a set of tongs and extracts dishes of whatever she has to offer. I grunt once for yes, twice for no. \\n\\nGranted, by this point in my life, I know what I'm looking for at dim sum: shrimp shumai, chinese tamales (sticky rice), fried crab claw and maybe a chao shu bao. But the beauty of the dim sum safari is that it confronts you with the unfamiliar and offers you things that you would have never asked for; things to which you were previously ignorant. In other, more Confucian, words: the virtue of the dim sum hall is enlightenment. \\n\\nThat being said, Windsor Dim Sum Cafe is every bit as tasty as the big places. Furthermore, they serve dim sum all day (One might say it's the IHOP of dim sum!).

There were maybe 5 drops of yogurt at the bottom, it wasn't tzaziki I assure you.  No sign of the mushrooms or olives that were supposed to be part of the gyro either.

We also shared the fried shrimp, which came with a tasty spicy-sweet sauce that was devoured rapidly. We each ordered our own clay pot dish: the moqueca completa, the mariscada, the tripe stew, and the feijoada completa for me. Be prepared for a boatload of food! Everything came out piping hot and unbelievably tasty; my dish was rich and meaty, with a few bones lurking about. Since I am allergic to bivalves, I didn't try anyone else's dish, but they all exclaimed about how amazing and tasty it was. Only one person in our group actually finished his entire dish, with most of us having plenty of tasty leftovers to bring home.\\n\\nUnfortunately, at the end of the night I was feeling extremely nauseous and sick to my stomach. Even though I had ordered a meat-only dish, I assume there might have been some cross contamination, as a lot of the dishes they prepare have mussels in them.

Most locals or nearby locals KNOW better than EATING on bourbon.  Unless you're completely wasted and it's 4 AM and you're jonesing for some small Krystal's burgers or something.  That said, i decided to check this place out after living here nearly three years.  It's been on my to-do list for a long time but, honestly, most of the reviews on here made me NOT want to come.  To hell with it, throwing caution in the wind and boy am i glad!  My friends had the boiled shrimp, they tasted almost like from back home!  Their friends had the fried crawfish and they were kinda bland.  My buddy had the gumbo, which was typical for the area, dark roux and theirs wasn't that thick and kinda soupy.  Taste was ok though.  I had a cup of the crawfish etouffee and it was pretty damn good too.  That roux was nice and thick and blonde.  For entree's a couple of us had the chicken fried steak and my buddy had the shrimp poboy.  Let me explain something.  Where we're from you can go on damn near any corner and get a shrimp poboy.  They're around $6-8 bucks, usually around 6-8 inches and STUFFED with shrimp.  We're pretty nostalgic about something we had easily and seemingly have SUCH a hard time finding one that doens't come across like a slap in the face by a carpet bagger.  Well, my buddy said \\"I wish i could get one like this IN Mississippi\\".  I nearly spat my food out.  Those are VERY strong words.  I had the chicken fried steak and buddy, it was just like my mama's.  I'm just hopeful that mama ain't back there slaving in the kitchen for minimum wage.  That said, i'll definitely be going back.

We read the Yelp reviews before going but figured that service was not going to be an issue at a crawfish boil.  Every crawfish boil we have ever been to, and we have been to a lot, involved someone scooping crawfish into a bucket and bringing it to the table.  Fairly simple and quick.  We arrived at Proof and Coopers at 12:00 p.m., right when it opened.  We were one of the first five groups to arrive.  We did not receive our crawfish until 1:20 p.m.  That's an hour and twenty minute wait for crawfish even though we were some of the first ones through the door.  We only received crawfish at that point because I got up, found the manager and complained.  During our hour and a half wait our drinks were not filled so when our crawfish arrived our drinks were empty.  We asked for refills and began eating the spicy crawfish.  After 15 minutes I got up and retrieved the drinks for the table.  EVERYONE was furious.  EVERYONE was waiting over an hour for their crawfish.  NO ONE was receiving service.  I have no idea what the owners were thinking.  All I can assume is that they have never done a crawfish boil and had absolutely no idea what they were doing.

I like to say that Austin is 30% Seattle, 30% SF, 30% Boston, and 10% Houston, and that's not a bad summary of Swift's. I recommended it to a client that we go there and everyone liked the food, decor and service -- thanks, Swifts! I'm sure the word eclectic appears in alot of reviews. Starting with the door! Three restaurants share one door and one staircase that sort of  branches off up and down like something in Hogwarts. Swifts is at the top of those stairs. There is alot of wood -- like on a ranch, not like a law firm -- and lots of separate areas that are defined by both light, furniture, and structures like bannisters and walls. I think it could be a date place because execution is so great, but looking around there were lots of groups, and Swift's is loud, so maybe not a first date. Oh, I should mention that the bar scene is cramped but lively. I think in our two hours there we had something like 50 or 100 staffers stop by to clear, check-in, recommend, and explain. They are all ultra-professional and super-casually dressed in black t-shirts, and recommendations are important here because everything is served to share, and there is no basic barbecue -- everything is very complicated and laden with sophisticated ingredients. The hallmarks are pork cheeks and korean bbq, but really everything was great -- went a couple of days ago so I don't remember.

Love Kama's tapas menu selections-buffalo chicken dip is my favorite. \\n\\nTo elaborate on why it's down a star, other day i went with my friends. They have never been but i love Kama so much and always have a good time so i wanted to take my friends. We got there and sat down. My friends were impressed by the decor. However was not impress that we had to wait 20mins before anyone came to our table to ask if we wanted drinks or food. When we finally got someone to take our order and we got our food they did not bring any utensils or napkins. So i had to go up to the bar and get napkins and request utensils. Needless to say i was a little embarrass. So this is a memo to Kama's staff, get back in the swing of things and step your service up. Rachel and i believe her name is gwen-you guys are awesome. Maybe the service was like that because neither of you were there (believe rachel was on the bistro side). I hope the quality of the food never deteriorates.

The breads are of medium variety and tend to sell out during the day, but for downtown, and the traffic, I would expect them to carry enough to make it through.  The pastry selection is not huge, and I've had both very good pastries and rather stale ones here.  Just look at what you're getting first, and you should do fine.

By explore I mean we ate at Easy Tiger, bought a magnet across the street and headed on our way to New Mexico.  \\n\\nI'd always been interested in visiting Austin for what I heard about its music scene.  Unfortunately we were on a bit of a rushed schedule and the weather was FREEZING so we didn't see much besides this place and the aforementioned Motel 6, though we left with positive feelings mostly due to the meal we had at Easy Tiger.\\n\\nWe found this place on Yelp, naturally and since I grew up in Pennsylvania and pretzels there are basically the main food group, the second I saw their giant soft pretzel pictorial I lacked all interest in lunching anywhere else.

It makes me think of that movie Fried Green Tomatoes when they kill that one guy and serve him for lunch.  \\n\\nWhen we got the bill the waiter had written- \\"What is your favorite superpower?\\" on the check.  My husband said he wrote \\"America\\" on the bill.  I wasn't maybe him any attention because I had to pee like a racehorse.  It only later dawned on me when we left Easy Tiger.  I told him my favorite super power would be the ability to shape shift leaving him horrified that he misunderstood the question and thought the waiter was asking what country was his favorite super power.  We were embarrassed for about 10 more miles down the road.  \\n\\nI'm still dreaming about that pretzel.

Biscuit was crispy and light, just the way I like it. \\n- Burmese Red Pork Stew - Mix the pork stew, egg, and rice so each spoonful you get a little bit of everything. The pork was sweet, tangy, and tender. \\n- French Toast - I tend to order savory items for breakfast, but this french toast was outstanding. Not too sweet, the bread was light, and the pear maple syrup was perfect. \\n\\nFood is solid and service is quick. There is a long wait so be prepared to do something while you're waiting.

Boy was I wrong. He ordered a half scoop of honey lavender and a half scoop of almond brittle with salted ganache on a waffle cone. I ordered a half scoop of strawberry balsamic with black pepper and a half scoop of freckled woodblock chocolate. OMG yuuum. The strawberry does not taste like balsamic or black pepper. Instead, the spice and the tart bring out the strawberry to give it to the most intense strawberry flavor you have ever had. The chocolate had a depth of flavor I had never had in chocolate before. You could actually TASTE the chocolate and it was pure bliss. My husband didn't speak a word until he finish his entire cone (and some of mine as well).

I'm Chinese, and this dish was exactly like a simple home made dish my mom used to make. Something I rarely even find on a Chinese menu, due to it's rather humble nature.

It took 15 minutes for our drink order to be taken, and ours was taken after two other tables who came in after us were helped.

He misunderstood me when I asked for a box, he didn't hear me say for the soup, and when he asked if I was done, he meant was I completely done. There was no soup to-go. He threw it away.

The place looks nice and brand new.\\n\\nThe bakery is upstairs where you enter.  I checked out the counter and saw a Pain au chocolat spot which was empty.  They were out.  Disappointing because as far as a bakery goes, there really weren't many other baked goods.  Seemed like they were out of just about everything.\\n\\nIt's seat yourself . Hipsters will love this place.  There are a bi-jillion beers and no ciders to choose from.  They could have a couple of ciders for those of us who prefer them over beer.  I think they had wine, I dunno, I didn't really check. \\n\\nAs far as food goes, they were out of pretzels.  How do you run out of pretzels when you're a German bakery?  Can't you just bake more?  I ordered some cheese and baguette.  (Note: Beer cheese is the spreadable one, the real cheese is on the right side of the menu)  The cheese wasn't fresh.  It had that darker color to the edge that means it's been around a bit.  Struck me as odd because I was told that the reason they ran out of pain au chocolat and pretzels was because they were working out how much to make.  That way they didn't end up with a bunch that couldn't be sold (and yet...my cheese was old).  I also didn't understand why I could only pick one cheese.  Does a couple of slices of cheese and a baguette cost $4?  I've had paid more if I could've just had a cheese plate.  I didn't order or taste a brat but my friends did and said they were tasty.  They were small BUT they had a pretzel bun.  Also, the food is served on a plastic tray (like at a fast food place) with a sheet of wax paper on it.  That seemed out of place with the decor/vibe to me.  Perhaps it's something hipsters like, fast-food chic?  I don't know.  I would've preferred a plate.  Or more cheese on mine if you're skimping on having plates...\\n\\nOur waitress was very sweet and treated us wonderfully.  I just think that for the price, I'll stick to Best Wurst.

We each had an appetizer- Steak tartar and escargot au gratin. Both were delicious, fresh and each was made properly according to the french classics. \\n-There are  plenty of entree options such as duck, seafood, beef, pork, chicken  and so on and every item had their own set up to it so that there weren't any menu items that had similar components. The flavors were unique, fresh and and flavorful.\\n-The desert menu was the real kicker. All to often restaurants drop the ball with the desert menu offering limited options and nothing in particular that stands out. At Le Petite Robert this became the highlight of my experience. They must of had a 9 or so different desert options if not more and each appealing. We had The Opera Gateau and The Baked Alaska. The Opera was a huge portion and delicious, probably one of if not the best opera I've ever had.

Suddenly, with the force of an avalanche, my unsuspecting taste buds were ambushed by the foulest, most nauseatingly horrid sensation they've ever known in their short, tender lives, stripping away their youthful innocence and gustatory idealism, and robbing them of their dignity by condemning them to live out the rest of their lives being haunted by traumatic memories of the brutal assault.

The compote I think though had a bit too much of rhubarb or something cus it seemed a bit tart. But it nevertheless still pretty good. \\n\\nI tried a bite of short ribs eggs benedict. It was pretty good...not my cup of tea because I don't particularly love that much meat in the morning.

I was initially wanting to come for breakfast/brunch on a weekend which is something I truly enjoy. I love brunch! We didn't make it for breakfast, but I had a rare hankering for a burger..not some crappy, mealy, mystery-meat prefab fast food type burger, but a proper burger. We were in the car anyway, coming back from a trip to the valley, and we decided to take a wee bit of a detour and come here. The burgers are supposed to be good too. We get there and it's busy, and so we wait about 15 min for a table. That's cool, no problem. We sit down, and a few minutes later our server comes by with menus, and asks for our drink order. We find out the  place isn't licensed..bit of a bummer as my bf wanted a beer with his burger and   I look forward to having a Caesar or a Mimosa with my brunch, which is what I've been really wanting to come here for. Ah well, if the breakfast is as kick-ass as I've heard, I could deal with that. \\n\\nSo, we both order burgers. Can't remember what mine was called, but it came with Yukon bacon and cheddar. My boyfriend had one that had a fried egg and weiner. I opted for a Caesar salad and ordered fries with a side of gravy, \\n\\nWell, we waited. And waited. And waited. Then guess what we did? Yep. We waited some more. Not ONCE did our server come and check on us to see if we wanted more to drink, or to tell us she hadn't forgotten about us, that the kitchen was slammed, or to apologize or explain the delay. In fact, I'd hazard to guess she actively avoided our table. Yes, it was busy, but there were still a couple empty tables and several tables already had food, and were in progress. The first time I checked the time, I think we'd been already waiting 10-15 min..hence why I checked the time. Then we waited another 40 minutes after that. It was long enough that I actually got up, and went to the server station where 3 staff were congregated and asked our server how long it would be. She said ours was the next ticket. This means nothing to me as who knows how long it takes for each ticket. Give me a time..not that we're the next ticket. At that point I told her that if our food wasn't on our table in 5 minutes, we'd be leaving. She apologized at that point, but I don't really think that if I hadn't gone up there she would have done so. So, we did wait, and at 4 minutes, we were looking for change to pay for the soda that had been ordered. She comes to the table just as we're about to leave, which I let her know. She said she was sorry for the wait, and that our food was on the house. \\n\\nWe eat our burgers, and both decided they were just Ok. I truthfully didn't care for the Yukon bacon, so I'm really glad my first time here wasn't for breakfast. My Caesar salad was pretty bad. The dressing was obviously out of a bottle, and the croutons were forgotten. The salad was also swimming in this mediocre dressing. Now, I LOVE sauces, dressings etc...but not when they're bad. My boyfriend said his fries were good, the gravy was bad...like it was from a powder or maybe a tin. His burger was also a little underdone, and said mine was better in that respect. I didn't even eat half of my burger, and left most of my salad. Honestly, at that point we were both really aggravated, and I had gotten past the point of being hungry. I was definitely on the verge of being \\"hangry\\". \\n\\nI understand that shit happens in kitchens..people get sick, they don't show up, someone is training, or any number of totally understandable  reasons that are not the server's fault. However...when a server not only doesn't come and ask you if you want a re-fill on your drinks, or to check in with you and acknowledge that your food is taking ages, but seems to avoid your table all together? For over 40 minutes? That's their screw-up. I noticed that we weren't the only ones that were waiting forever either. \\n\\nAll in all, I'm thoroughly un-impressed. Lousy service, average food in an interesting, novel setting.  The prices for burgers were average I guess? Mine was just under $12 with a choice of fries or green salad. Yam fries or Onion rings could be substituted for another $2.10; I'm guessing the same for the Caesar. \\n\\nWill I/we be coming back? Nope. As I've said before, way too many places in Vancouver I have yet to try, or places that have good food and good service to haul my can out to North Van for another shot at this place. Crap service aside, the food really was just Ok, and not worth the time and gas to go out there.\\n\\nA big thumbs down to this place."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my favorite Barbacoa in Orlando!

Haley House works to educate and engage those who are homeless or in poverty.  The bakery cafe is one of the means by which this is done, playing host to a training program in a professional kitchen as well as the opportunity to work as front of house staff.  Those in the Haley House program learn to cook nutritious food with local ingredients (their own Noonday Farm as well as The Food Project).  Why?  Because areas such as Dudley Square are unfortunately the home to many fast food, greasy, and unhealthy options.  By introducing other options with real ingredients, no preservatives, and is local to the area, Haley House hopes to not only make a change with those who work there, but those who visit as well.  It is about community.\\n\\nThe cafe has recently expanded its hours to include Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday evenings with events each night.  Wednesday is jazz and pizza (so going back for that!!), Thursday is an open mic, and Friday is a vegetarian cooking class open to the public.  What better way to provide a safe place.\\n\\nSo the mission is great, the people who work there are great, being super friendly and open to conversation and learning more about those who come in to eat, and best of all, the food is delicious.  The pumpkin muffin I had was moist, fresh, flavorful, and had pumpkin seeds on top.  A simple, brilliant idea...that I have not seen executed anywhere else.  YUM.  The coffee is fairly traded and delicious as well.  I wish there were more flavors (hazelnut, ya hear?) available but there was one decaf, a medium, and a bold option which definitely more than suffice.\\n\\nThe clientele that come in range from business owners, neighborhood residents, and visitors alike of all ages, sizes, and color.  It is diverse but open to all.\\n\\nIf all of this in itself did not sell you on Haley House, check out the ever changing menu and note that it is INEXPENSIVE to get your hands on the food and experience there.  I paid just a little over $3.50 for that excellent pumpkin muffin, coffee, and the opportunity to sit and learn about the homey feeling cafe for an hour.

But Trend Asian Cuisine litterally has it all.\\n\\nI've never had a menu so simple yet intimidating at the same time.\\n\\nEach section is divided by a color and a tab making it easy for customers to read.\\n\\nBut.......\\n\\nTHERE'S PICTURES FOR EVERYTHING.\\n\\nGreat for reference but it just makes this HUGE menu a lot more distracting and densely packed with options and colors and words and letters and wow, just wow.\\n\\nHere's a quick rundown of what went down after reading 20 chapters of Trend Asian Cuisine:\\n\\nDim Sum was meh (as expected from a non Dim Sum focused restaurant). Shomai was a little dry and meat broke into chunks. Har Gow is supposed to be sticky but not so sticky go where the wrapper sticks to BOTH the chopstick and the   bamboo steamer which ripped it apart.\\n\\nBeef Noodle soup was much better lighter than ones I have had in the past, beef was tender but still a little chewy in a good way (I loved it).\\n\\nYang Chow Fried Rice was good. Exactly how you'd expect it from an Americanized Chinese take-out.\\n\\nBeef Bulgogi was much simpler than ones I've had from more authentic Korean Restaurants. Used less spices and flavoring here but it did come in a sizzling skillet. Went well with the rice. It was litterally just shredded meat with onions.\\n\\nAll the sushi we tried was good! Nothing fell apart and it tasted just fine. Spicy Mayo also had much more of a kick than usual.\\n\\nSo the food overall was good. I'm picky with my Dim Sum but I didn't expect much so I let it go. Everything else was great.\\n\\nService was great but the only thing I could nitpick other than the Dim Sum was the cleanliness of the dining area. Some of the decorations need to be dusted and wiped.\\n\\nThere ya have it! The place that truly has a lot of different Asian Cuisines is alright! Not the most authentic but they do have a lot of options and the prices are not bad at all.\\n\\nOh and don't forget that they do have hot pot! You probably forgot didn't ya?\\n\\nExactly.

Well good thing we planned to hit this on a weekday but it's friday! so the wait was still doable at 40-45 ish minutes. If it's an hour or over that- mama don't play that. Despite all this, the hater in me was still going strong so I remained jaded until our food came and I took a bite. My brother, sister in law AND Bon Appetit magazine didn't steer me wrong. I should trust bro and sis by now with the Portland food scene opinions, I mean hello Du Kuh Bee's. So this. It's damn good people. It's fucking. Delicious. Portland, you are so lucky!\\n\\nTip #1, come early! We had originally planned on arriving at 9 but that didn't happen partly because of jet lag and staying up too late. We were quoted 40 minutes.. more and more people came in again and again to put their name down and waited. I mean we witnessed one \\"grown person\\" throwing a tantrum walking out with a baby saying \\"who makes a baby wait an hour??\\" That's so kewl! A young infant (that looked like it was 3-4 months) can eat solid foods here on the menu? impressive. /sarcastic font. Entitled biotches, they're nationwide!\\n\\nAlso it's communal seating and bar seating. My brother said this is a good way to spy on what others are having and seeing if it looks good. You can definitely smell how wonderful everyone's food is. Everything on the menu has no description but just simply stated as to what a dish is. Everything is meant to be shared here family style so there's small plates and big plates. I started off with the chocolate potato donut with creme anglaise. omg, it's perfectly fried, moist, chocolatey and even tastier swimming in creme anglaise, ugh so good! I wanted more but we were about to do lots of eating that day so I stopped right there. I highly recommend!! Even my brother liked it and he's not that into sweets. \\n\\nSo here's what we got that blew my socks off:\\n\\nAuntie Paula's french toast with mixed berry maple and whipped cream.. a half order. It was good, a little different than your average french toast. Out of all the dishes, we agreed we could have gone without this one. Mother's bistro is better. \\n\\nBBQ Chicken hash with onion sour cream and over easy egg on top.. Good Gawd, this one was amazing! A perfect over easy egg on top of a hash chock full of roasted veggies like potatoes, red bell peppers, collard greens, onions, brussel sprouts, etc. They made the veggies soooooooooooooooo tasty in this dish, all perfectly cooked and seasoned with torn up pieces of chicken. You break that egg and have the yolk melt into the hash with the sour cream.. perfection. It's so good. You must get this. I insist. I can eat plates and plates of this and be happy. When the people next to us got this and we were still waiting for our food, we knew we ordered right because it smelled intoxicating. I kid you not. \\n\\nPork cutlets with fried egg and sauteed spinach.. this was also pretty impressive too. Perfectly seasoned battered and fried pork that's still juicy and tender inside, yess. This with garlicky spinach and a fried egg- damn good and satisfying. \\n\\nPolenta and sausage ragu with a thin layer of mozzarella on top complete with a fried egg.. this was really rich and creamy. Very hearty, warm and just right for a chilly morning. Very good. \\n\\nBesides all this we couldn't do brunch without some alcohol so my sis in law and I had two different bloody mary's from their long list of different variations of a bloody mary. Hers was the dim summore, it had hoison sauce in the mix- it was really good and pleasant, not spicy. I liked hers better than mine. I had the lady vengence with fish sauce, rye beer, kimchi juice, kimchi and korean chili pepper as garnish. It was nice and spicy but the fish sauce really brought out the rye which was a bit much for me. The fish sauce and kimchi juice reeled me in. I'll try something else next time. \\n\\nAll in all, I loved Tasty N Son's. It lives up to the nation wide hype. Best brunch ever! Makes a lot of places in Chicago for brunch seem so ordinary and middle america which it is middle america. I'm usually not sweating brunch like other Portland natives but this one is worth waking up early and waiting (not over an hour though) for.
