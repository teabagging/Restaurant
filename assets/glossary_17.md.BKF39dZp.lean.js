The drink was sent back with the expectation of a fresh one being made. When the drink returned, red juice from the cherry was still in the glass. All they did was take the cherry out and send it back to us. Would you just scrape mayo off a sandwich and send it back to someone instead of making a fresh one? Not to mention did you just stick your probably dirty fingers in someone's drink to get a cherry out? My guess would be probably yes. The icing on the cake was when our check came and the 18% gratuity had already been added for our party of 5???!!! Never have I seen a gratuity added to a party of less than 6 or 8.

I am not sure whether because the steaks should have been marinated for a longer period of time, or they weren't cut across the grain properly, but there is room for improvement! We still enjoy the dish overall but I think steak addicts might have one or two things to say about it. For the desserts, TWO THUMBS UP, I cannot find any faults with them! \\nFor more pictures and detailed review, feel free to check out my blog post! http://underthebostonsky.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/restaurant-review-bistro-du-midi-back-bay-boston-ma/"},{"name":"Jolly Roger","address":"1340 S E 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite sports bar in PDX.

The last time I went I resolved to just have spring rolls, because who can screw up spring rolls, right?   They came out luke warm and the wrap was dry and leathery.

Great staff \\n2.  Good food (they have gelato too!)\\n3.  Amazing drinks (LOVE their chai latte)\\n4.  Live music on the weekends\\n5.  Free wifi\\n\\nI had read all the rave reviews on Yelp and decided to check out Cafe Luna myself.  Upon entering, I had a 3 minute chat with some of the servers and by the end of our conversation I knew I was going to love this place.\\n\\nThe place IS small and the layout is narrow, but I love the cozy feel of it.  I went on a Sunday right before brunch time so I was able to grab a table for myself and my friend.  \\n\\nWe ordered from the weekend brunch menu and both our meals were fantastic (Greek omelet and Belgian waffle).  We ate our plates clean.  They even gave us free cinnamon buns (which were AMAZING).  \\nFor drinks I ordered a tea and then the infamous chai latte.  I loved both.  My friend ordered a regular cafe latte and she loved it too. \\n\\nMy friend and I then proceeded to whip out our laptops/books to study.  Even though it was crazy busy, the staff was extremely accommodating and did not rush us to leave.  \\n\\nI love the vibe the place and the live jazz music playing in the background was a plus.  We were sitting towards the back so the music was not too loud while we studied.  (Perfect for casual studying - NOT a place if you need absolute silence aka library studying).  The place is perfect if you love to study with a constant busy (but non-intrusive) buzz around you.  But beware! Tables are relatively small so don't expect to sprawl all your books out.

A lot of people haven't experienced the euphoria that is the original Wings, so they'll give this place a solid review.  It's kind of like making out with the girl that makes out with every dude in high school.  You're thrilled because you got a make out in and you're no longer the loser who's never done it, but you don't know what it's like to make out with the girl that only makes out with dudes who rule the school.

When we moved away to Texas and then moved back. This was the FIRST place we went.\\n\\nBasically, this is a healthy-option buffet that you can feel GOOD about going to afterwards!\\n\\nDon't let it's touristy location fool you. This Sweet Tomatoes is anything but tacky, touristy (besides some of the people at times), or a rip-off. The employees are always attentive, kind, and have a smile on their faces. The salad bar is always constantly monitored and cleaned, and fresh selections brought out just on time. The cashiers do a great job of quickly moving the line through without making you feel rushed, so even if you see a long line through the salad bar, the wait usually isn't as long. This location can get pretty busy, but we have never had a problem getting a table in the 13+ years we've been frequenting this location.\\n\\nThey always have a wonderful selection of soups, for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. My favorite, Big Chunk Chicken Noodle, is always kept in good supply. I'll get cups of just the broth. It's so good. If they run out of a particular soup, it's quickly replaced with a fresh homemade batch of deliciousness. My husband particularly loves their chili. They will sometimes have an AMAZING ginger broth you can garnish yourself with fresh mushrooms, tofu, scallions, and oyster crackers. It's absolutely divine. \\n\\nThey always have a steady supply of perfectly cooked sweet potatoes and regular potatoes, with options of regular or honey butter, and garnishes of cheese, sour cream, and scallions. They also have cinnamon sugar for the sweet potatoes. \\n\\nTheir focaccia is WONDERFUL! They always have a four cheese focaccia, which reminds me of a fancy cheesy-garlic bread. They also have a pizza-like focaccia, and sometimes, they do a grilled cheese focaccia, which has this wonderful cheesy sauce with a delicious breaded crumble on top. It goes perfect with their tomato soup!\\n\\nA good selection of pastas as well. The macaroni and cheese is always a hit with the kids.\\n\\nThe muffins are AMAZING. From cornbread muffins, to blueberry, to cranberry orange, to these EPIC CHOCOLATE BROWNIE MUFFINS! My husband uses the brownie muffins as a base for his ice-cream (shh! It's healthy frozen yogurt, but don't tell him!) sundaes. \\n\\nThey have a great selection of fruit, with my favorite guilt-free dessert: SUGAR-FREE CHOCOLATE (sometimes they have a seasonal flavor, like peppermint for christmas time) MOUSSE! Only 40 calories per half cup, and it tastes AMAZING.\\n\\nThey have a soft-serve machine with toppings a plenty. \\n\\nSign up for their e-mails. They ALWAYS send out coupons.

Matt Murphy's would have been a madhouse, and Lineage only does Sunday brunch, so we decided to try Allston Diner.\\n\\nWe got there around 9:45 and were seated right away. The place was busy but not overwhelmingly so, and even when we left an hour or so later, surprisingly there still wasn't a line... guess Allston hipsters and frat boys don't rise before noon?\\n\\nWaitstaff was all very friendly and accessible, providing good service, and the diner itself is cute and cheery. They have a good menu, covers the basics but also has some interesting items as well. I was drawn to the Nutella Garden (nutella, peanut butter, bananas, strawberries, and whipped cream sandwiched between 2 pancakes), but was really craving waffles (wish you could substitute for the pancakes!), so I went for the buttermilk waffle instead.\\n\\nMy waffle was fresh and tasty, topped with whipped cream and tons of actually ripe strawberry slices and blueberries (shocking for a breakfast joint, usually you get the wilted/white fresh fruit,or some kind of compote). Seriously, where did they find such ripe and juicy fruit this time of year, they definitely didn't taste frozen... pretty stoked about that. I also got a side of the home fries and they were delightful, thin slices of potatoes perfectly seasoned with rosemary that really hit the spot. Such classy home fries for a diner.\\n\\nThe boy had the BBQ Brisket Breakfast (in-house brisket over texas toast topped with melted cheddar and 2 eggs any style. served with home fries) and was also delightfully surprised, as the house-made brisket wasn't just chunks of beef but was chopped up finely and formed into a sort of patty, making it easy to eat. He's not a big breakfast fan so usually goes with the lunch side of brunch menus, but this dish had the best of all worlds and he was happily satisfied.\\n\\nThe diner is a step up from a greasy spoon, so prices and quality are both a bit higher comparatively, but worth it... we cleaned our plates and were full for the rest of the day (incidentally, we did not have another meal that day, but whether that has to do with Allston Diner or the subsequent Paddy's Day festivities, I'll leave it to you to decide...). Also, breakfast all day? Nicely done.\\n\\nThumbs up, Allston Diner. I'll be back (your chicken and waffle is calling).\\n\\nUPDATE 7/7: the chicken and waffle is indeed amazingly delicious.

That's the best way to describe my first Island Creek experience - a big ol \\"hallelujah\\".\\n\\nYou can get oysters pretty much anywhere these days, but there's something to be said for the freshness and attention to quality here at ICOB.  Twelve different varieties were available when I went, and I tried about eight of them.  You simply must have the namesake Island Creek, an enjoyable oyster even when it's a tad off.  Several other south shore/Cape oysters were on the menu, plus a handful of west coast ones - I tried (and loved) the Blue Pool and Kunamoto out of Washington State.  There were none from Maine or Maritime Canada, but there must be a reason and I trust their judgment.\\n\\nAlso went with an order of razor clams - I've seen their unique shells on the beach but had never eaten one.  They're very rubbery and fishy in that Cherrystone/Littleneck sort of way, only a very elongated version.  After a plate of oysters, it was an interesting texture juxtaposition.\\n\\nThe hamachi (yellowtail) crudo was just heavenly, as yellowtail is one of my favorite sashimi/sushi fishes.  \\n\\nThe potato gnocci provided a much-needed infusion of warmth and substance into the meal, which had already been augmented by two pints of Harpoon's limited \\"100 Barrel\\" series bock.  Some honey infused butter and chewy sourdough-esque bread helped sop up some of that beer as well.\\n\\nWhat helps make a great meal into a 5-star experience also has to do with the service - our sever Noelle was friendly, attentive and oh so helpful in making suggestions and giving her input on dishes we were contemplating ordering."},{"name":"Casa Alvarez","address":"3161 Walnut St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"The salsa is really bad, let's get that out of the way first.

I'll remember to utilize that in the future.\\n\\nSo. This restaurant. It's everything I remembered it to be, plus much more. \\n\\nDespite having so many orders to take, our food was delivered to EVERYONE in about 20 minutes. drink orders were brought out quickly, including water and soda refills. \\n\\nOur waiter for the evening did a PERFECT job. He was waiting on the entire upstairs of the restaurant (3+ other parties of 5+ people as well) and never lost his cool. He took plenty of time speaking to everyone who had questions about the food and explaining the specials, including being a complete wealth of knowledge about the food, what dishes / drinks / rices matched, how to eat certain things together, how sauces are used in each dish, and wonderful in-depth descriptions of spices and flavorings. I'm in awe that he was able to dedicate so much time to that many people and still place orders and deliver food so quickly. He clearly has a passion for what he does and it made for an absolutely perfect dining experience, even above and beyond the food and atmosphere which speak for themselves.\\n\\nOur little section of five people ordered five entrees (regular fish sauce wings, spicy fish sauce wings, pork satay, beef ribs, and the catfish vermicelli dish), three servings of rice, and 5 sodas. total was $83! It was the perfect amount of food for 5 people, and well priced for such a wonderful experience. \\n\\nI've already raved about the fish sauce wings...well, the spicy wings are even better, I found out. A little bit sweeter and have a crushed peanut coating. \\n\\nTheir peanut sauce is delicious ^_^\\n\\nReally, every dish was incredible. I don't really want to go into more detail about each individual dish, because I'd be writing for days if I did...BUT, I think my new faves are the spicy wings and the beef ribs. the ribs are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth perfect. \\n\\nWhat little problem the cramped (but authentic) seating caused was far overshadowed by how great the staff and food were.

The place is so small you need to call ahead to make reservations. My friends and i had to reserve a table outside because we brought a dog or with us. Outside the little shop there are two benches that can seat 12 and two small tables for 4 each.\\n\\nInside the kitchen is tiny. But do not let the size of the kitchen fool you. The food that comes out from that little tiny kitchen will blow your mind.\\n\\nI've been told that the menu changes every day, and the owners / chefs buy the ingredients every morning before they set up shop.\\n\\nThe menu is small which usually indicates that they focus on a few things but focus well on those few things. Because we had a party of 6 we shared the salads namely the garden salad the asparagus and the roasted cauliflower. All 3 had very distinct flavors and all 3 were very well done. You can tell that the ingredients are really fresh and the sauces that were drizzled over the salads and vegetables were delicious and flavorful.\\n\\nAmongst the 6 of us, we had the pork belly which came sitting on a mash. The pork belly was perfectly charred on the outside, the meat was soft and tender. The toast that came with the pork belly did not taste like toast at all, it was a pleasant surprise. We also had flat iron steak, the medium rare steak was tender and juicy, the steak came sitting on a bed of lettuce which contrasted very well with the savory flavor of the meat. We also had the whole snapper, it was about one and a half pounds. The Snapper was deep-fried but not oily at all. The skin was crispy and the flesh inside was flaky. We also shared a pasta, it was a green pasta, I did not read why it was green, I suspect it was spinach. I loved it anyway.\\n\\nLastly do not forget to bring your own drinks.

Keep up the good job Dish Dive!"},{"name":"Finale","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"I have to say that Finale lived up to my expectations going in, except for one unfortunate area: the dessert. For a place that's known for its desserts, and having a reputation among previous yelpers of being slow, with small portions of pricey, not fantastic food, that's really not a good thing.\\n\\nOn the plus side, my girlfriend and I sat at one of those corner booth half tables where we sit next to each other and look out into the restaurant. Also, I was full when we left. Other than that, this was a very subpar dining experience.\\n\\nThe waitress took about ten minutes to make her first appearance. By then we were already hungry and had decided what we wanted for dinner. She seemed confused by that, but took our orders anyway. We both ordered the dinner and dessert prix fixe - one \\"entree\\" and one dessert for $17.99. We also ordered a salad to start with, because we were really hungry. The salad was supposed to be a spinach and arugala salad with walnuts, onions, apples, and crumbled goat cheese. The goat cheese was replaced by cranberries on the actual salad, and it looked like it was thrown together in about 45 seconds (over a half hour after we ordered it). The dressing tasted like it came out of a bottle. It was a salad I can make at home in about two minutes, which is not what I am looking for when I dine out and spend $8 on a salad.\\n\\nThe \\"entrees\\" came out another half hour later, and I keep putting quotes around entrees because they were what you'd expect from a small plate restaurant. My girlfriend's white pizza was about the size of a pita, and maybe 1/3 of it had toppings, the rest was just crust with a lot of air bubbles. My sweet potato lasagna looked good, but tasted like absolutely nothing. If I had been wearing a blindfold, there's no way I would have placed the main part as being sweet potato or the ricotta and pesto cream sauce on top.\\n\\nBut we fought through all of this to get to the real part, the thing that Finale is known for, the desserts! Another five or ten minutes after we finished our meals, the waitress came over and asked if we wanted our desserts put in then. As much as I had enjoyed my hour and a half in the restaurant so far, I really didn't want to be there anymore (that was a joke, the first hour and a half had been pretty bad). The desserts came, and they just weren't that good. Again, tasted like something I can make at home, which is not what I want when I'm eating out and spending that much.\\n\\nOverall, the dinner wasn't bad. It just wasn't good. We weren't impressed by anything, and I was insulted by the prices. Even with a buywithme gift certificate and a lousy tip reflecting the completely indifferent server, it was way too expensive. I could see how that would be a great place to go after dinner as part of a romantic date, for a glass of wine and a dessert (maybe we just ordered the wrong ones), but for dinner it's not worth your time and money."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to agree with everyone who told me that this place is a must stop when going to a Sox game.

Rudy's won't make you a sandwich, but they'll give you bread and sauce for you to make your own. I liked this idea, and enjoyed my sandwich.\\n\\nThe sauce really is pretty delicious. I also had the potato salad, which wasn't quite up to the high standard that I hold potato salad. It was too runny, and didn't have the right solid/creamy texture of my mom's salad. The sister had beans, which she seems to enjoy.\\n\\nI give Rudy's 3 stars because of the shouting cashiers and because they serve you food on a piece of paper- which reminds me far too much of Joe Cotton's in Robstown (near Calallen and Corpus Christi), which I have despised for my entire life. The BBQ was good, but not the best.

My only other complaint was that it was crowded and the staff didn't let you know where to go and what to do.

Half their menu wasn't available when I went on a Saturday night. This place gave me a stomach virus. I would never go back. Such a let down. \\n\\nFull: I was really looking forward to trying this place after reading some of the reviews and viewing the pictures that were posted up on Yelp. There aren't many Asian dessert spots in Boston area so I had high hopes for this place. My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night. We walked up to the front of the place and on the front door there's a pretty noticeable sticker that says \\"free wifi\\". As soon as we opened the door we got hit with a really bad odor. It smelled like old seafood broth/sewage water. But because I was eager to try their dessert we went in and found a table. There were a decent number of people already seated inside. You grab a menu from the counter, seat yourself, and when you're ready you go up and order. There was only one lady working at that time. She gave us a couple menus and we immediately noticed when we sat down that majority of the menu was crossed off. They didn't have shaved ice, bubble teas, and waffles available. At that point my boyfriend was uninterested in what the place was offering. We were left to only order a soup dessert. We got it with a herbal jelly base, aloe, barley, sweet potato, and taro mochi. It took a bit of time to get our one order to our table. It was not good. In the previous Yelp reviews and pictures their desserts were served in bowls with great presentation. Ours got served in a disposable bowl, like the ones you use at a froyo place. From the seat my boyfriend sat he was able to see how everything got made in the kitchen. Our sweet potato was microwaved, everything else pretty much came from a can, and the mochi was boiled in water. It didn't look all that great either.  \\n\\nWhen I went to go order, I noticed that there were two large TV screens posted up by the cashier. I'm assuming that's what is used as a menu board. However they were both turned off. (Probably because 75% of the menu wasn't available.) \\nThere was a couple who sat in front of me with a laptop open and a couple of other people with their phones out. So that reminded me to go ask for the wifi password. I asked the lady at the counter what the password was and she said something in Chinese to one of the workers in the kitchen. Then she looked at me and said something in Chinese to me. I don't speak nor do I understand Chinese so I asked her to repeat it in English. She seemed flustered with telling me what it was. She told me to \\"hold on one second\\" and I returned to my seat. Two minutes later she came by and told me that their wifi wasn't working. I mean it wasn't a big deal but the way that she went about it was really sus. I almost didn't want to believe her, especially because there was two people at a different table with their laptop open. Again, not that big of a deal but it just added onto the list of things that wasn't available for us that night. \\n\\nThe following day I woke up really sick and with symptoms of a stomach virus. Sweet kingdom was actually the only place I left my house to go try. I didn't have anything else out of the ordinary that day. \\n\\nI wasted time and my health being excited about a place for nothing. \\n\\nAlso there is on each of the tables there's a sign that says if you write a \\"GOOD Yelp review\\" and show a screen shot of it to the management at sweet kingdom you get a free dessert out of it. It's pretty much bribing you to write something good/give them 4-5 stars on a review so you can get a free drink/dessert.

The first being the old school choice and one of the most reviewed restaurants on Yelp, that being Neptune.  Then the new school choice being the swank and hip Island Creek.  Of course we had to go to both to see who does it better.  We went to Island Creek for supper, it is quite trendy and to ensure a table we booked a few weeks in advance.  Our server was great, he explained where the oysters were from and pointed out some of his faves.  All of the oysters were super briny and the mignonette was perfection.  We ordered a few sides but if i were to go back i would stick to the oysters. When dining here, do pick a cocktail, their drinks are amazing, they really hire bar chefs here.  We ordered a drink that was made with watermelon, tomato and basil.  Which these three ingredients would make a great salad, but they took them and made a very successful alcohol based drink.\\n\\nOverall it became quite difficult to compare it to Island Creek, if you want to go to a place that is traditional then Neptune is for you.

I have never been to a pho restaurant that didn't think lime was important enough to bring out as part of the fresh vegetables that can be added to the pho.  I know a Vietnamese restaurant is not known for fried rice but honestly their shrimp fried rice was a joke.  It had no seasoning or love.  The idea of fried rice is a poor mans dish combining leftovers into a searing hot pan resulting in a medley combination of flavors.

I had driven by this restaurant several times and from the outside, it's hard to tell if this is an authentic Chinese or American-Chinese style restaurant because they have a large lunch special banner hanging outside, which to me screams cheap, American chop suey. \\n\\nMy parents are originally from Hong Kong so they know Chinese food. I'd be embarrassed to take them to some horrid American-Chinese buffet restaurant, but we decided to check it out. My dad said that if there's no one in the restaurant, we should leave. To our surprise, the menu had Chinese writing in it and there were other Chinese families eating inside, so that was a good sign. The menu selection was pretty wide so that was also a good sign. \\n\\nWe ordered the deep fried tofu appetizer (#103) to start. Delicious! It was lightly breaded and seasoned with salt and pepper and garnished with some chopped, sauteed jalapenos, red bell peppers and onions. The portion for an appetizer was very generous. We'd order this again, but maybe count this as an entree instead of an appetizer and order less food.\\n\\nWe also ordered the pepper salted prawns (#164). It comes with or without shells and the shrimp head. We opted for shell-less since it's easier to eat without the shells. If we had known that the deep fried tofu was also a pepper salted dish, we would have ordered something different, but in any case, the prawns were very good - not over-fried. It was exactly like the deep fried tofu, but with good sized shrimp.\\n\\nNext, we had a whole sole fish that was deep fried (#176). This wasn't my favorite dish because the fish was over-fried and dry. Although it came with a tasty dipping sauce (not your typical Americanized sweet/sour sauce), it was just too dry for my liking. If we order fish again, I would order this steamed, instead, to keep it moist and tender.\\n\\nThe next dish was #154, salted fish and chicken with eggplant clay pot. The flavor was good, if you're a fan of salted fish. I think it would have been great if it only had eggplant. Salted fish-tasting chicken was just kind of odd to me.\\n\\nFor our vegetable dish, we ordered green bean with garlic sauce. The beans were super tender and garlicky - delicious! Definitely will order this again!\\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was the vegetable lo-mein noodle dish (#198). It just had a really off-taste to it and the noodles were super pasty. It was just plain nasty. We told the waitress about it and she had no qualms about taking it back and substituting it for a vegetarian chow fun noodle dish (#210), which was really yummy!\\n\\nI'd definitely take my family back to this restaurant again. Since we live up in the Salmon Creek area of Vancouver, this is a good alternative to driving all the way into Portland's Chinatown for an authentic Chinese dinner.\\n\\nWe'll be back!

It was a little heavy on the sugar and salt but otherwise, it was sort of bland.\\n\\nPork loin tapas: a sticky sweet mess.  Again, too much sugar in this one.\\n\\nCeviche de la casa: chilled to the perfect temperature but for a restaurant that calls itself Ceviche, their house ceviche was extremely disappointing.

When I've made paella myself, I've always found that the hardest part to get right is the rice but everything else is a cinch.  Ceviche's paella came out with the rice cooked perfectly but everything else was a mess.  The chorizo and chicken were burnt.  The mussels and clams were overcooked into tiny rubbery morsels.  The fish and TINY scallops were overcooked until they were dry.  Even the half lobster tail was overcooked to the point that the meat stuck to the shell.  When we finally got the meat out of the shell, it was tough and rubbery.  SO disappointing because if the kitchen knew how to cook the protein, the paella would have been DELICIOUS.

We were in need of a little culture down here. Ceviche is a newish place that everyone has already tried to due to the word of mouth praises it recieves. Its a tapas restaurant, tapas being appetizers meant to share. I hadn't known this fun fact before now. I was here on a random Thursday night for a date and let me tell you it was quite a romantic atmosphere. The restaurant was gorgeous and festive, really invoking thoughts of Spain. Lighting, intricate wood, and ornate wall hangings were but a few of their attentions to detail. We started out with a bottle of wine that our server was happy to assist us in choosing. After much discussion we settled on a light white, Osborne, \\"Solaz\\",  that turned out to be perfect. My stomach was growling though, so I was pleasantly surprised with the extensive menu it would take months to get through. Over 100 different tapas both hot and cold. Wowza. I looked toward my dinner companion who had dined here before for advice. The Patas Bravas ended up being my favorite choice. It was simple enough, fried potatoes, but the sauce that accompanied it was delish. We also got a lamb dish that was good, though I am not much of a lamb eater as well as a tasty beef dish. To be honest there is so much to chose from it can make your head spin. Ceviche is just one of those places where you'll have to go a handful of times before really getting a feel for the food. Though I doubt you'll mind. I thought I would have trouble grasping their tapas concept. I'm more of a conventional eater-  I'll order what I want and you order what you want, not a big sharer. But with so many interesting options it made it easy to jump right into this new way of dining. Ceviche isn't cheap, but with this ambiance and menu what do you expect. Plus, as I mentioned they have a separate room consisting of a large dance floor where flamenco and salsa dancers come to mix it up Friday and Saturday nights, something downtown was lacking. Ceviche is a place to grab dinner, drinks, and get some dancing in while exploring another culture.

So near the top of my \\"Back in Boston\\" to do list was a visit to ICOB, where I had many good meals (driving back for a Riesling dinner welcoming Terry Theise to Boston sticks out in my mind).\\n\\nUnfortunately, as is often the case, memories can't be replicated...\\n\\nSome nice wines, but the non-traditional Pimm's Cup was completely forgettable.\\n\\nAs expected, great oysters (we tried 6 different East Coasts, and as usual preferred the ICs).  You can't go wrong with the selection and serving of oysters here.\\n\\nPersonally I wouldn't order the clam chowder again as it didn't really excite me (the spoon-full of lobster bisque I tasted was more interesting), but YMMV.  Clam chowder is a personal thing, and personally I'm a big Legal fan (so sue me!).\\n\\nA nice, delecate salmon tartare was unfortunately overpowered by the accompanying house-made potato chips and was better eaten by itself with a fork.\\n\\nAnd a cold half lobster was exactly what it sounds like, although they should really plan on providing diners with some way to clean their hands after cracking open lobster claws...eventually a bemused waiter agreed to bring us a moistened towel.\\n\\nThe big disappointment was the oyster sliders, which were featured recently on Eater's \\"EAT THESE 25 CLASSIC BOSTON DISHES BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE CITY\\" list, and were a big reason why I was there. Mystifying Eater, just mystifying. I love a nice plump fried oysters sandwich, but these sliders contained so much deep-fried breading surrounding the tiny oysters that, when combined with the bun and toppings, left little if any detectable oyster texture or flavor. The oiliness would have been acceptable if there actually was an oyster somewhere in there. Nothing like Eater's plump photograph. Sorry, I would put this on the \\"25 dishes to miss in Boston\\" list!\\n\\nAlso, although service started out friendly, it was confusing as to which of the several waiters was really responsible for our table. Which might have had something to do with our being left hungry, drinkless (despite having orderd another), and ignored for at least 20 minutes towards the end of the meal. So we got fed up and didn't bother with more oysters, drinks, or dessert and just left.\\n\\nAll around, I'm more than a little disappointed, given my very positive memories from 5+ years ago.\\n\\nI think I'll stick with oysters and a glass of wine in the future."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Deliciously tasty.

Hot griddles are in the center of most all of the tables.

There are also options for the non-chef folk to have them make pancakes for you or if you really, really, really just want a savory egg dish.\\n\\nI give the place 4 stars for the food. We were pretty boring and had the buttermilk batter with some blueberries and maple syrup to \\"jazz\\" it up. I thought they were pretty darn delicious. We ordered a side of the maple walnut bacon which was absolutely heavenly (a must-have for the bacon lovers out there). Mimosas were pretty solid with a good OJ to bubbly ratio (more bubbly, less OJ). Biggest downside was the price (hence 3 stars). We ended up spending about $40 for two, which seems a bit ludicrous for breakfast when you're really only eating pancakes. I think it's possible (and probably sufficient) to split one bottle of batter between two.\\n\\nA line was already in place at 7:45 (opens at 8am) on a Saturday morning but once everyone was seated by 8:15 there were still empty tables.\\n\\nFabulous for kids who are skilled with squeezing ketchup bottles and spatula use."},{"name":"Rubino's Pizza","address":"2643 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Simply the best.

I prefer Nigiri sushi over rolls, and most of the people herego after the rolls than the Nigiri Sushi. So I never had to wait for my sushi. During the lunchtime  they do not serve Sashimi but they do serve Sashimi salad. I love their non-veg sea food salad options. They have couple of seafood salads including squid and shrimp.

The service wasn't great but far from poor.  The waitress was nice, checked up on us a couple times and got the job done.  \\n\\nThe food I was a little disappointed with.  I ordered the southern crisp fried chicken wrap and substituted the fries for beef chili fries.  My uncle ordered the 2pc southern fried chicken main.  When the food arrived at our table it looked delicious and photo worthy.  However, everything tasted like it needed salt, and I'm not one that puts a lot of salt on my food.  Also, the chicken in both our meals was dry and wasn't crispy at all; it didn't have that signature crunch I was expecting from a piece of southern fried chicken.  My beef chili fries were also hard to get through.  I needed more water as the combination of the chili and thick cut fries that were dry made it difficult to swallow.  \\n\\nThe prices weren't bad at all.  $10.50 for a chicken wrap (chili fries was extra) and $12.50 for a main are both very reasonable.

I asked what kind of slices she had, she grumpily replied, \\"cheesepepperoni\\". I wasn't sure if that was cheese and pepperoni, or cheese, pepperoni. I'm not big on cheese pizza, nor pepperoni. I asked if she was going to have anything else coming out soon, she said NO. This is what I would have said, \\"Sorry we don't have any vegan or vegetarian options, usually around 5 or so we add the pesto slices.\\" Something along those lines.\\n\\nI debated with my friend to decide whether we should get a whole pizza or not, but decided the latter because I think their whole pies are really overpriced. We decided on 2 slices. Instead of charging us the Happy Hour price, she charged us full price. She was such a grump I didn't want to ask because I was sure she would most likely spit on my slice. I am also the employee of a company that gets a discount there, which I also did NOT mention. After we got our change back, my friend motioned to the tip jar, to see if I wanted to leave something.

Can't say there's any place like this that I've seen in the metro-Atlanta area.  \\n\\nThis definitely isn't your typical Asian buffet you would find off Buford or Pleasant Hill (Duluth). Other Asian style buffets that offer this much variety cannot match the quality of the food here. And I believe they turn the food pretty quickly here. Better than your typical Chinese buffet that serves half the number of items. The food here I believe is pretty good and there are plenty of options for seafood lovers (crab, oysters, sushi of course, fried or baked fish) and for meat lovers (Korean ribs here are pretty legit, trust me. I'm Korean. No really, trust me.). \\n\\nThe price is steep, but it's a buffet with pretty good sushi and wide variety of other options, INCLUDING udon.

It was around 6pm when we arrived. First impression place was too dark and warm (my daughter was able to look at the thermostat and it was set at 80 F) It was hard to see the menu because of the lack of lighting, and also for the first time ever I was sweating inside of a restaurant and believe me I don't sweat very easy. Despite this conditions we decided to stay and give the place a chance. We ordered cocktails (Mimosa, Champola, Daiquiri and Mojito) omg this drinks were so not good specially the mojito tasted horrible and they all lacked alcohol. Oh and by the way the menu with the drinks/coffees and deserts didn't have prices listed. We also ordered appetizers and it was good but the croqueta price crazy only one piece for $2.50. Entries were so so overpriced and poorly executed: \\" La mariscada cubana\\" $19.50 it was literally 2 lbs of overcooked yellow rice with some fish flavor, 4 shrimp, 1 small octopus (looked like a small plastic toy), 2 small muscles a total rip-off. \\"El churrasco with congris and mariquitas\\" $18.00 the steak was overcooked and hard to chew, rice was either old and reheated in the microwave or undercooked. The chicken tenders from the kids menu were so dark like it was fried in a 2 weeks old oil. About the staff, I have never seen anything like it, there were employees sitting by the table next to us on their cells. Also who looks like the owner or manager of the place was walking around us and also sitting at the table (maybe this table is the employees area) next to us (by the way also on her cell) and never make eye contact neither tried to interact with customers. Pretty much every member of the staff was more worried about their cells than customers satisfaction. I was born and raise in Cuba so I know my food, but also I have worked in the food industry in the US for 18 years. Cuban food is full of flavor and our people is so much fun and Guantanamera is a disgrace to our cuban cuisine and culture.

We waited 90 minutes for a table but, on a Saturday night, were not shocked to have done so. In the meantime, there are many, many places in the area to grab a cocktail while trying to avoid the rain. \\nWhen we were seated it was right next to the door so that we were exposed to a chill each time someone entered or exited. I can't exactly wage a complaint with that. We had to sit somewhere and the place was packed. \\nOur server was a little difficult to hear and that made ordering a touch frustrating especially since she simply couldn't fathom the fact that were we not ordering drinks other than water. I almost felt like I was obliged to explain to her that we'd been drinking alcohol for the last hour and a half on empty stomachs and genuinely needed to stick with water. I will openly admit that I resent it whenever I feel I need to explain myself to a server, even if I don't actually utter a word of explanation and am just left with the inadequate feeling that I should have. \\nWhile this waiting and drinking had occurred, my partner became obsessed with ordering the Pok Pok Special (half of a roasted game hen and traditional papaya salad). I tried to talk him into choosing a dish we could share in addition to my shared choices but, like I said, he'd become obsessed. He reported that it was fine, just fine but he should have followed my advice. \\nAs for my choices, we went with the \\"Yam Makheua Yao\\" and the \\"Khanom Jiin Kaeng Khiawe Waan Luuk Chin Plaa.\\" The first, a dish centered around smoky chunks of Japanese eggplant, was quite unbalanced. The eggplant itself was indeed smoky and smoky is delicious but some of the other elements didn't compliment this smoke very well. Still, did I mention that smoky is delicious?\\nThe \\"Khanom Jiin Kaeng...\\" (noodles with green curry) was hot and I mean hot-for-hot's-sake. Don't get me wrong. I could eat it, and did, but many of my bites were just hot, not heat layered with other tones and flavors. The garnishes that arrive with this dish saved it for me because who doesn't want a chewy gelatinous piece of fish ball topped with crunchy dried anchovy, fresh basil and egg? These elements came together for me in the way that the Makheua never did.\\nWhen all is said and done, I think some of these issues are to be put on our shoulders. We were too hungry and boozy when we ordered and I know that I, for one, went for noodles and curry for those very reasons. I wish I had tried the \\"La Vong\\" (catfish). I feel like this particular concept would deliver that for me in a way I would have enjoyed. \\nSo while I cannot say this was a great experience on any count, it was memorable and I would try Pok Pok again. Just maybe not on a Saturday night."},{"name":"Flying Falafel & Po' Boys","address":"2001 Guadalupe St, Ste A1","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

The space is cozy with a lot of sport memorabilia all over and eclectic Neapolitan decor.  We opted for the only available outdoor seating which was perfect for a warm summer evening.  First thing I noticed, all the waiters spoke Italian--talk about authentic.  I already had my mind made up before sitting down.  I love lasagna!  It's my favourite and if I had a last meal on Earth, I would eat a whole pan of it.  We also shared the Insalata Caprese.  Slices of fresh mozzarella, roma tomatoes, fresh basil, pepper and extra virgin olive oil was simple but delicious.  It was a light and refreshing start to the meal.  I can't recall what my friend had, I think he had the Pappardelle al cinghiale (pappardelle with wild boar meat sauce).  Of course I can't remember because I was so fixated on my lasagna.  It didn't photograph well but was tasty--piping hot, perfectly crusty at the edges, rich with the meat and bechamel filling.  It definitely hit the spot.  \\n\\nProbably one of my top picks for Italian food in Portland, but why four stars and not five?  Waiters were friendly, however, it was difficult to get their attention when we needed something.

The meal hit a couple of high points and was overall quite satisfying. The bread basket to start was surprisingly greasy. It's interesting that the restaurant chose to serve it with olive oil  instead of good butter, though I have to admit that the olive oil was spectacular. I'm still waiting to find a French place that's adventurous enough to make its own compound butter to go with their bread. The escargots appetizer was delightful! It was not done in the cliched Bourguignonne style--with an herb-garlic butter that tends to drown out the inherent flavor of the snails. Here they were simply roasted and left to shine atop toasted farro and a scrumptious chorizo emulsion. It wasn't the lightest first course, but it made me excited for the next.\\nWhich was where things went wrong. The grilled loup de mer with confit fennel was possibly the most uninspired seafood dish I've had in a while. I have to confess that I'm not a fan of grilling--I don't think the hallowed \\"grill marks\\" add anything but a burnt and bitter taste to food, as it did to the fish skin in this dish. The garnish and sauce ought to have compensated, but the fennel was bland (almost completely robbed of its vibrant aniseed flavor) and there was no sauce that I could see. There were bits of some kind of citrus on the plate but that was so incredibly sour it threw everything off balance. Granted, the fish was nicely (though simply) seasoned and stayed moist, but that was about the only positive thing going for the dish. Thankfully the side that I ordered--advertised as roasted Brussels sprouts by the waiter but was actually mixed cauliflower/sprouts with parmesan and pancetta--was flavorful enough to make up for the entree.\\nDessert was a chocolate-hazelnut mousse with salted caramel ice cream--and this really made the meal for me, though I'm a sucker for anything hazelnut. The mousse was melt-in-the-mouth light and nicely complemented by the saltiness of the ice-cream. I did wish that the hazelnuts sprinkled on top were toasted though. Overall, 3.5 stars for unpretentious food executed well (save for the fish dish misstep), and I'm bumping it to 4 for good service. I'm definitely returning to try out their regular menu."},{"name":"KFC","address":"6217 International Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"This KFC was great !

It changed a \\"why in the world would they call it a signature dish\\" to a \\"wow...this is an awesome dish and I wish it were bigger\\".

Though this review will most likely drown in the sea of positive reviews, I feel that it must be known how much this establishment has changed my life. \\n\\nYes, I'm another Portland transplant. Yes, I grew up a tiny town in New Hampshire where \\"Chinese\\", Japanese, and Thai food can all be consumed in one place. That does not mean that my food awakening was any less than that of a San Diego foodie hipster.\\n\\n\\nJust let me have my moment Keith...  \\n\\nThe first night I had Pok Pok was the first night that I felt like I belonged in Portland. Being away from my Filipino parents' cooking for years was rough; only having simple dishes I can make like adobo, tocino, and tinola to get me by... At Pok Pok I felt like I was home. Being under the tin roof hut, around caring individuals, and having what it seemed like my parents cooking (though they've never made those exact meals). The culinary experience started off with water. The effing water got me all starry eyed. I thought it was coconut flavored, though I was later informed it was pandan. For my main course? Kaeng hung leh. The curry pork belly. Not only is pork belly the most delicious thing jeebus created, it had sitaw (long beans for all you non-Tagalog speaking folks). I ate it with coconut rice, oblivious to the fact that sticky rice was just as amazing and fun to eat with your hands. For dessert, now and forever will be the affogato.. Condense milk ice cream, toppedVietnamese coffee, and with a side of fried donuts. A perfect ending for this perfect meal. \\n\\nSince then I've tried to explore different options but I seem to go back to my first meal I've ever gotten there. I've taken my mom and she was just as impressed and reminiscent of home.  From the steamed branzino special that she ate clean to the bone and still to this day compares all her meals to, to the winged bean appetizer she remembers harvesting as a girl in the Philippines.  Though Pok Pok is inspired from Thai cuisine, it will always be a great reminiscent of my homeland.

Well, in short there are two reasons: 1) The price for the quantity of food is a little high! Granted, most of the quality is good ... but gosh! so expensive! AND 2) The quality and quantity of the pork in the pork rice vermicelli has gotten worse. In the last several visits, I've only gotten tiny pieces! (i mean, pieces!) of pork ... like all the scraps! About 1.5 to 2 years ago, I used to real chunky pieces of pork (and not the scraps that were like 2-3 mm, yes, it was not a mistake! mm = millimeters).  My cousin, who has been ordering from here for many years agrees that it has gotten worse!\\n\\nOkay, so now that I've spilled my guts about why I don't like the quantity/quality of pork given and the prices, let me proceed to tell you WHY I like this place.\\n\\nI've been coming here for about 3 years or so, now.. thanks to my cousin who introduced me to this restaurant. What is on the menu when dining or taking away? Flat Pork Rice Vermicelli Noodles! PORK! Not Chicken and not beef. PORK is the way to go. In an effort to be \\"healthy\\", I ordered chicken twice, but each time, the chicken was always dry and chewy to eat - not good. The beef was the same -- dry and not very good. The pork always seems to come out somewhat moist, flavorful, and good (just forget about the 2 mm scraps of pork we've been getting lately).\\n\\nWhile I've ordered a couple other dishes on other visits, they weren't memorable enough for me to remember, mention, or order again. The way to go is to get the Flat Rice Vermicellie with Charbroiled Pork. (Sorry, call me biased! but everything else just does not compare!)\\n\\nOH! Their fresh basil/spring rolls (not fried) with charbroiled pork is delicious. Also expensive, but delicious! (I recommend that you come here once a month or once every couple months). \\n\\nNOTE TO SELF: When ordering the flat rice vermicelli, they will ask you, \\"Would you like the spring roll wraps with it?\\" But they probably won't tell you that it's an extra $2.50 or so for only a handful of wraps.

For dessert, we went with the bread pudding.  \\n\\nI'm not sure why the lobster fritters get so much love here on yelp....I felt that deep frying lobster in a batter completely masked the sweet goodness of lobster and instead tasted very similar to fried shrimp...not impressed.

The market in front is nice to browse, but who would buy anything there I have no idea - everything is exceedingly overpriced, and you can get it all elsewhere.\\n\\nParking at the Kendall Sq garage is $1 PER hour - not $1 for 3 hours as the Commonwealth website states.  Just a heads up.\\n\\nWe received water and coffee promptly, and ordered soon thereafter.  Their menu isn't huge, but it seems like there's something for everyone (though nothing inexpensive).  Food seemed like it took just a bit long to come out.\\n\\nWe shared the Nutella & Banana French Toast, and the Chicken & Biscuits.  The french toast was good - very dense (as it was \\"bread pudding\\" french toast), tasty, with deliciously caramelized bananas.  However, I expected it to be more layered, than each item separately.  And the nutella was very sparse, and watered down - not thick at all as it should be.  It was a little disappointing, and hard to eat all the components together.\\n\\nThe Chicken & Biscuits was huge, good, but pretty heavy (as it should be?  fair warning)  The sausage gravy and chicken were tasty yet unremarkable, the eggs were eggs, and the biscuits were pretty great (obviously loaded with fat.  delicious, delicious fat).\\n\\nThere is a back room that looks like it can be closed in for private dining which is pretty cool.

The second time I came here, the food was amazing. So far, La Fonda Latina has been consistent and delivered on the high quality of food. The restaurant itself is small, but has an upstairs area as well as outdoor seating. I would suggest sitting upstairs or outside over sitting downstairs, because that area is very claustrophobic. If you choose to sit upstairs and it's summer, I strongly suggest sitting under a fan...otherwise, best of luck to you while you brave you taco/margarita sweats. Both times I went, I got the pork taco which I STRONGLY recommend for any pork lovers. The pork is like a delicious lechon; it's smoky and there are a few caramelized bits that have just a bit of crunch. You can tell that it's been cooking slowly with under someone's loving, watchful eye all day. The free chips are good, and I'm so glad that they aren't over salted. The queso dip tastes pretty standard, but is still delicious because...I mean it's melted cheese what else could you possibly want. The rice and beans that come as a side with the tacos are also really great. The lettuce and tomato on the taco were nice and crisp and tasted fresh. I've also had the frozen mango margarita, which was amazing and VERY strong. Last time I went, my fiancee and I split a margarita pitcher on the rocks and it was great and also very strong. Whoever mixes the drinks has a pretty generous pour. \\n\\nSO, now that we've established that the food at La Fonda is delicious and great...onto the reason why I am docking two stars: cockroaches. Yes, you read that correctly. This is truly unfortunate because the food is really amazing, but the location in Buckhead has cockroaches.

Like I said, that seemed pricey for the type of place we were in, especially since you don't even get a server. But, when the food came out, it was well worth waiting for. The Cajun chips were served first, about 7-8 minutes after we ordered. Even though they were listed as a side dish, they were served ahead of the meal, like an appetizer. The serving size was huge. Honest-to-goodness, they were served in an aluminum roasting pan, one big enough to roast a whole chicken in! They were hot, and crisp and delicious. We had to wait another 10 minutes or so (maybe a bit more) for the entrees, but they were absolutely delicious. My husband had the steak. I didn't eat any of it, but I tried the mushrooms and onions. They were cooked to perfection. I couldn't believe the size of my Blacken Chicken. It was served on a large platter-sized, square plate. The whole plate was covered with pasta. A creamy sauce was poured over the pasta and then 6 pieces of blackened chicken sat on top of that.

I went to another establishment and their shucker's rule is \\"if you can't get it done the first swipe, it's thrown out\\". I gather it's because they can't guarantee that they didn't accidentally get some shell in it. If you can't shuck them or can't guarantee there's no shells, then please don't sell oysters. I'm knocking off the 1 star simply because of this. The lobster was perfect. I've never had a restaurant butcher a plain boiled lobster, so there was no complaints. I really loved it all natural.

This is a \\"hostless\\" restaurant, meaning the waiters get to seat customers as they come in.  There was an \\"option\\" to put our name on the list, but given the number of open tables and few people waiting, we didn't think it was necessary.  After the line started to build up, we put our name on the list.  There were three open tables outside, all the seats at the bar open and several tables in the main dining area open when we came in.  By the time one group was sat (they split up the group of seven, apparently because they were too lazy to push the two tables together), there were even a few more tables open.  We waited 10-15 minutes before one of the waiters yelled at the group waiting \\"we can't seat people until tables are clean.\\"  He stood there in front of us and did nothing while the tables weren't cleaned off.  There were clean tables, plenty of them.  If he wanted the rest to be cleaned, he could have at least done that, but it would have been better if he had just sat all of us waiting at the clean ones.  It was sad, too, because I had already picked out what I wanted on the menu and was looking forward to it.  It was too much to take, however.  I wasn't willing to give money to this group of staff.

At lunchtime it got really crowded , but only for like an hour between 12 and 1 pm and then really quiet again, which was nice , so we had time to talk. A nice hostess showed us the table, the waitresses very attending, polite. I would say 5 star service , which is very rare. Kendall knew the wine card and the whole menu, which she has all tried , she said ;). The food came quickly with a gnocchi appetizer and fresh shrimp/ you could tell , In a creamy sauce. Yummy. We had wine and water. Second dish was the pumpkin salad with salmon and I had the scallops with spinach , very good, also the lemon tart dessert. Over all really great food. Nice location and staff. 5 stars. The only thing, and I am very observant to this , the toilets and it starts , with the first door. Really dirty and inside , it has not been cleaned for a long time. And I mean the tiles on the sides and surfaces. In the big toilet it looked like boogers on the wall?! See picture . I don't know, why restaurants don't spend money in cleaning staff. I went to mighty fine burgers  and every 5 minutes someone was swiping the floors. It's so sad because it's great food, but through that , I wonder how the kitchen might look behind doors. Also the glass at the front at the open kitchen area was really dirty. I think it's very important to show a clean restaurant inside and out, it represents the restaurant and also the determination, to have everything perfect. Especially to guests and hygiene perspective. I told the hostess, she was a bit quiet about that. I didn't see the manager, but I will tell him next time. Or maybe he will read this ;). The hostess said she will take care of it, but after 2 hours nothing changed. I don't know who is in charge, or if they have a cleaning team, but definitely they should concentrate on that.

Kudos on keeping an eye out for when our drinks were running low even though they were very busy. The food was good! I ordered migas and coffee. The tortillas seemed to be homemade, thick and just great tasting. I also ordered a half order of gravy and biscuits. Awesome sausage mixed in there. Their pancakes are huge. My friend and her family were pleased with this restaurant as well. We thought the fact that it was connected to the Garfield Library was so cute. Our visit was on a Sunday so the library was closed, but we could still stroll in it and take a look at books. The porch area is nice and my fianc√© and I plan on returning and definitely have breakfast out there when the weather is a little more nice. Thank you to the staff at Hit The Spot Caf√©!!!"},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Sea food? \\n\\nAre you kidding me?

Too boot, the waitress hardly came back, then comes when it's time to pay and brings a credit card machine to the table. Never seen that sh*t before. WTF!? She acted like we were from Mars as we don't pay at the table on a CC machine like that. She was really making us feel unwelcome and practically chasing us out. This particular Red Robin and Red Robins in Canada suck compared to US ones!

The stuffed eggplant (with homemade fusili) is amazing.\\n  \\n---\\n \\nExtended Review:\\n \\nIn Boston, most people associate good Italian food with the North End, for good reason, and it's a great place to take visitors because it's also a nice, quaint neighborhood.  But for Cantabrigians who want delicious Italian food without having to trek all the way out there, Basta Pasta is an almost perfect substititute.\\n \\nMy personal favorite is the stuffed eggplant, which is a few large pieces of perfectly fried eggplant that are filled with spinach and red pepper, smothered with melted cheese, and garnished with basil.  The chicken marsala is also outstanding, as is the bolognese.\\n\\nIn addition to being delicious, the pasta portions are also ridiculously large and reasonably priced.  The stuffed eggplant is only $10, and one plate is just enough for me and my wife, who both have big appetites.  Also, for a few extra bucks, you can substitute the normal linguini or penne option with homemade fusili, which is not only fresher but also more filling.\\n\\nEven though it is called Basta Pasta, the sandwiches/paninis, pizza, and even the burger are also very solid.  The only drawback is that there are no seafood options on the menu, which many restaurants in the North End offer.  Nevertheless, I would rate Basta as good, if not better, than the restaurants in the North End."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The tacos are listed at gringo prices, definitely more expensive than any normal Mexican should be willing to pay, but holy knight they are hella good.

Clearly this must be remedied.\\n\\nI went to Java Monkey all of once and the experience is still ingrained in my head nearly 6 years later. Yes, it was that traumatic. I went with a few other Scotties (Agnes Scott Students) to get a coffee fix off campus. I ordered a mocha. Simple enough, right? Should be fairly sweet, right? Wrong on both counts. After one sip, I nearly spit it out. It tasted bitter and burned. Even after dumping the equivalent of my body weight in sugar into it, it still tasted bitter and burned. That's just not right.\\n\\nIt's all well and good to like your hippie coffee made with coffee beans that agreed to be in the roast in the first place, but honestly, make it taste good.

Most dishes here are around $10.95-$12.95 for your basic Chinese cuisine including General Tso's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork, Mongolian Beef, etc.  Is it worth it when you have places like Ho Ho's who have the same dishes for around 30% cheaper?  Depends on how long you're willing to wait for a seat and service.  Din Ho has been around for quite some time and has built a good reputation which causes this place to be constantly busy.  To be honest, the food is good, but not enough to be priced as high as it is.  The one thing that stood out to me was the Hot and Sour soup.  I love Hot and Sour soup, and the Hot and Sour soup here is the best I've had in any state.  It's PACKED with ingredients and flavor and is enough to be a meal on its own.

The second positive is that you can people watch while waiting for your food. The negatives of Virgo and Pisces is that from first glance it was the type of place that you would spend a romantic evening with someone. There was very little lighting so you could barely read the menu, it took forever for anyone to come over to give me and my sister a menu, it took 10 minutes to bring water, and it took even longer to get our food. For the atmosphere of the place I felt like the food should be really good, but boy was I disappointed. The hamburger I had was bland at best. I could get a better burger at McDonalds and I haven't gone to McDonald's in years. If you're looking for a nice place to go this is not one of them.

The first two times were wonderful, but service and food declined the last two visits. I have requested a window table several time and not once have they sat us there. Perhaps I wasn't with a large party that bought an expensive bottle of wine or ordered the tasting menu so I received mediocre service? Not what I expected from a reputable restaurant in Boston that won the Best Service 2013 award. However, one of the servers, Amy, is amazing! She is super sweet and consistently provided impeccable service throughout the night.\\n\\nOverall, their food is solid. I LOVE goat cheese and gnocchi, so I was absolutely in love with their goat cheese gnocchi dish, but unfortunately, I think they no longer have it on their menu. Their seared foie gras appetizer is one of the best foie I've ever had in my life- it literally melts in your mouth. Their east coast oysters, steamed mussels, and braised pork belly appetizers are legit. The entrees were subpar. I would just order a bunch of appetizers and wouldn't order any entrees (unless, of course, if they bring back their goat cheese gnocchi!), but if you have to, order fish. The fish entrees here are flavorful, light, and delicious. I wasn't a fan of their pork chop, duck breast, rib eye, or lamb neck. There were way too many conflicting flavors.. it's either too buttery or salty. I can't finish an entree without two glasses of water.\\n\\nFor dessert, grand marnier or chocolate souffle is the way to go! Be sure to order when you receive your entrees as it does take a while to prepare."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The food, concept, and atmosphere are great here, but we really found the service to be lacking, if not plain rude at times. We went for brunch on a Saturday morning around 9, and the wait was 45 minutes, which was fine and not bad considering the wait time others have posted. One member of our party, who was not present when we initially put our name on the list, went in to inquire about the wait time, and the person rudely told him that they already told us it was 45 minutes and it's only been 10 minutes since then. This seemed rather uncalled for. As we were waiting for a table, we noticed that there were actually a lot of empty tables, and that for whatever reason, the restaurant is really slow at refilling tables after people leave. Once we got seated, we were ready to order (because we'd been looking at the menu for the past 45 minutes), but the server wasn't ready to take our order. \\n\\nWe did really enjoy the food and had fun making our pancakes. Some of the items seem a bit of a stretch for the price (scallions for $1?), but the concept of being able to mix and make your own flavor of pancakes is great, and they even have some delicious-sounding combinations suggested on their menu. We really enjoyed the sweet potato batter, and I also loved using goatcheese on both sweet and savory pancakes. \\n\\nAt the beginning of the meal, the server put oil on the griddle and spread it around with a brush. Then he set both oil and brush on a ledge behind us between our table and the next. He specifically pointed out that when we add toppings to our pancakes, we should add more batter before we flip it -- presumably so that it doesn't stick to the griddle. So when we ran out of oil after our first batch, we picked up the oil and brush behind us to add more and left it on our table. Moments later the server came by to reprimand us, saying no oil and brush on the table and set it back on the ledge. But a few minutes later, when we needed to add more for our next batch of pancakes, we noticed it was gone completely and we didn't spot it the tables around us either. We were considering asking for it, but since we didn't spot anyone around and since we also felt like they might not be willing to give it to us or might come back with another snappy remark, we just started using the butter, which we were given to spread on top of our pancakes but we ended up mostly using to grease up the griddle.\\n\\nNear the end of the meal, we felt a bit like we were being rushed out. Now, I understand that lots of people are waiting, and we had been waiting for a while too, but I didn't see the need for us to feel unwelcome. We'd been at our table for less than an hour, so I didn't think we were overstaying either. Even though we had a little bit of food left on one of our plates, the server came by and asked if he could remove it, one of us hesitantly said ok, but we didn't get a chance to ask others whether they would like the rest of it or not. Shortly after that, the server brought our check, even though we had not asked for it. Even though our plates were mostly empty at that point, it seems to me that it is always polite to ask whether there's anything else we want to order or at least whether we're ready for our check, rather than just plopping it down on the table. Furthermore, when we looked at the check, there was an automatic 18% gratuity added. This seemed to be the final kicker that will lead me not to return to this restaurant. I'm not sure whether the 18% gratuity is automatic for larger parties (we had 5 adults and 1 toddler), but any kind of automatic gratuity seems absurd to me for a DIY restaurant where we are cooking most of our own food! And especially when the service is this lackluster and some of the staff have a bit of an attitude, I really think automatic gratuity is not appropriate. I would have liked coming again and recommending the place to others for the food, but considering the wait and the poor service, I will be doing neither."},{"name":"Willys Mexicana Grill","address":"650 Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I love Willies.

But when it was suggested to me for a Friday night dinner I'd thought I'd try it out.\\n\\nI have to start off by saying that this place has the most sophisticated taste out of any restaurant I've been to in Columbus. The food was super high class and the quality was amazing. \\n\\nThe concept is simple. You order about 5 or 6 \\"shareable\\" (I'll speak more in this later), which consist of starters, entrees and desserts. They come out one after another. \\n\\nWe started with hush puppies starter. They were perfectly fried and the white sauce they came with was really great. I wish they could have added more sauce with them. Following that we got the Mushroom toast starter. I've never had mushrooms with so much flavor. Everything went together so good, the flavor was out of control. This was definitely my second favorite thing we were served. \\n\\nNow for the starters. We had the deep sea crab gnocchi. This was very good as well. Very creamy and light. You could tell that the crab in it was high quality and you could get a taste of every flavor. Then after that we got brought out the Bacon Risotto. Let me tell you. This is probably a top 5 dish in Columbus for me. Or even in my life. This is the best risotto I've ever had. When they brought it out it was plated very well and visually appealing. There was a soft egg in the middle and what appeared and tasted like candies bacon prices on top. When you busted the yolk and mixed it with the risotto, words can't explain how good it was. Every flavor was present. The textures were perfect and every different part of the dish was distinguishable while being blended and came together perfectly at the same time. Best risotto you can get your hands on! The head chef should be very proud of himself.\\n\\nWe decided on not getting a desert. But we did get cocktails. Myself, I got the \\"Samnoa\\" or something like that. It was a whiskey based drink. I had to grab it since I'm def a whiskey guy at heart. This wasn't some mixed drink at the club. You could definitely get a strong taste of the whiskey, but at the same time taste the subtle undertones of different flavors in the drink. It was really well made. And they didn't skimp in the alcohol in this. So even though it was about 12 bucks. You got a good amount of liquor. \\n\\nMy biggest thing was that the portions were sooo soo minuscule. For 20-12 dollars a plate. There was very very little food. There's no way these are sharable. And if you account for how good they taste, you will want way more then what comes. I found it really hard to justify spending that much money on so little food. But maybe that's just me. This is the only thing I can say negative about this place though.\\n\\nThe place was very well set up. When you walk in the doors you come down the steps to the restaurant. There tables are well lit and everything is set up elegantly. We sat at the bar. Everything looked organized and high class. The workers looked professional.\\n\\nThe service was really great as well. They made sure to check up on you a lot to make sure that you had everything you needed. Drinks food whatever. They were very helpful. When the servers from the kitchens came out they gave a background or explanation in every dish.

Plates featuring a star protein and two sides are boring, which is why I began frequenting veg restaurants long before I went meatless, working with limited ingredients forces innovation, and sometimes produces subversive flavor combinations. \\"Are kimchi fries a thing?\\" Who cares! But the all-American menu that Counter Culture maintains is extremely creative, and both environmentally and practically sustainable. There's a manageable number of options, which saves diners time in ordering, and the chefs time to practice perfecting their signature recipes. If you think \\"fake meat\\" means \\"tofu disguised as\\" ... you ain't seen nothing yet. The technique that goes into mimicking the bulk and texture of a hamburger patty with beets and mushrooms is remarkable, and a testament to the culinary range of s/he who can pull it off. I know there's an art to seasoning a piece of beef, too, but it's a dying one. There won't always be enough meat to go around, so we better learn to love our veggies, and here's a good place to start. \\n\\nWhat made mine a four-star experience were minor flaws in service and atmosphere. The waitress was uncomfortable with the menu, and deferred to my expertise (that I never claimed to have), when asked specific questions. She did not know the ingredients in the avocado key-lime pie, which had a frozen/thawed consistency, so it may not be made in-house. The cat decor is crazy kitschy, and on purpose. Does being a hipster-vegetarian mean I have to love cats?  Sheesh. The patio looked really pleasant, though, and I'd love to sit outside next time (if/when it stops raining)."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This is a great brunch place when you're looking for unusual brunch or lunch options (lots of goat-cheese in their food).\\n\\nOverall, I've been able to find a lot of gluten-free options and always felt fine afterwards.

It's about arriving at 5PM and waiting outside in the line in front of the tiny restaurant, staring at the red brick buildings and laughing with friends whilst you watch people in front of you and behind you drop out or fill in the line, people watching, speculating on which combination of tables the waiter will find for you and slowly letting your appetite grow as the door opens and closes bringing with it the sounds and smells of italian food being made from the open kitchen inside the 20 seat restaurant. \\n\\nPeople have said that the North End's Daily Catch is overrated for Italian food. Based on the food alone, perhaps there are better places to get pasta, or better places to get seafood. But there is no place like dining at Hanover street's tiny restaurant. Waiting in line isn't onerous at all when with friends: it feels like a rite of passage, a little challenge that makes getting the seat in the restaurant more an achievement than just a formality. When my friends and I were finally seated, we were suffused with a sense of joy and also took our coveted seats with a sense of pride as we watched people waiting in line outside poking their heads in. \\n\\nThe Daily Catch is just a fun place to go if you're in the mood for it: sitting right next to the stove, we were warmed by the excitement of the chef bringing food to the flame, the gigantic orange blaze licking the ceiling and lighting the restaurant up with exhiliration. Watching the chef work three large silver pans of black pasta filled us with a buzz, and when the entree size aglio olio's arrived at the table complete with large silver tongs, it seemed to be the completion of a gripping process rather than just the beginning of the journey. \\n\\nThe food itself was delicious but not incredible, but did it really matter? The black pasta was thick, fresh and chewy, and the alfredo sauce was creamy and cheesy whilst the aglio olio was peppery and flavorful. The aglio olio could've been far spicier and could've been more subtle, and the dishes seemed to be carried by the texture of the homemade pasta. The calamari was good as calamari always is, fried and fresh and delicious with an amazing tomato sauce. Nothing was spectacular, but the experience certainly was. I think that's what makes dining at the north end special: it may not have the most affordable food, nor the best food. But when you eat and watch people outside envying your warmth and your experience, when you sit next to friends crammed inside a tiny restaurant knowing that you've earned your seat, there's a special feeling you get. As we were walking in after having waited in line, one man said \\"Don't bother. It's a waste of your time and your money.\\" Maybe it was the fact that the day was warm, and the snow didn't bother us. Maybe it was the fact that I was with good friends and we were high on laughter the whole time. But I would say it was most definitely worth it."},{"name":"Thunderbird Coffee","address":"2200 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I didn't have anything to eat, so I can't comment on the food, but I did have a delicious peppermint Italian soda.

From the fine food to the beer selection, you can't go wrong. Despite their struggling new Creekside surroundings, Buck Mulligan's appears to be weathering the storm. It's never too crowded (which is a breath of fresh air compared to Easton) and can easily accommodate and appease any group. \\n\\nFor lunch, I recommend any one of their handcrafted burgers which are all very, very tasty and unique. For dinner, I would recommend either the Shepherd's Pie or the Bangers and Mashed. Either way, you can't go wrong, because they are both Irish staples and they are very good. \\n\\nI have to share this remarkable story. We visited Buck Mulligan's last night during the Gahanna Christmas Parade and Festivities at Creekside. Naturally, we took advantage of another fabulous meal for an early dinner. We sat right next to the fireplace. What a treat after weathering the cold outside to get a picture with Santa. A family sat down next to our table consisting of grandparents, parents and one child. They seemed very jovial and in the holiday spirit. \\n\\nThings changed quickly, though, as soon as Grandpa tried his steak entree. He was very upset, because apparently the steak was not cooked to his liking. We first noticed the situation when the Manager arrived at their table. The Manager was very humble and apologetic. He offered several remedies, but to no avail. Grandpa was so upset that he refused to eat anything at all! He rudely rejected the Manager's offers and made quite a scene. Wow...talk about a Scrooge! \\n\\nWell, needless to say, that put a damper on the holiday spirit. As his family ate away, I could see Grandpa stewing away sporadically adding more negative comments about his experience. I felt sorry for him, but more so for his family. Then, suddenly, the Manager reappeared with a new steak entree cooked exactly the way Grandpa had originally ordered it. Grandpa immediately rejected the Manager's offer. (Uhg, here we go again, I thought.) The Manager insisted and Grandpa began devouring his new piping hot meal. Then the magical words that recaptured the holiday spirit came out of Grandpa's mouth. He said, \\"Thank you\\" to the manager and smiles reappeared on everyone's face...even mine! :) \\n\\nI later complemented that Manager for his heroics. Man, was I impressed! That made my evening. Not only was the food great, so was the service. I strongly urge you to frequent Buck Mulligan's. Whether you like a frosty mug of Smithwick's or a steaming cup of Potato Cheese soup, you will be warmly greeted and respectfully rewarded for visiting Gahanna's finest and most authentic Irish Pub. \\n\\nCheers to Buck Mulligan's!

What started out as a pleasant stop, turned into a disturbing experience. To start, I placed a drive thru order for a nugget meal combo with 4 Polynesian sauces to accompany. My order was recorded and repeated back to me. I was instructed to drive around and pick up my food. Everything was normal up until this point. When I got to the window to pick up my food, I checked my bag and noticed that there were only 2 sauces in my bag (when I specified 4). No big deal, I pulled to the window to ask for 2 more sauces, but what happened after this I wasn't expecting. \\n\\nMe: Hi, I may I have 2 more Polynesian sauces--I only received 2 in my bag.\\nWindow Attendant #1: (awkward stare) Yes ma'am I already put 2 in your bag.\\nMe: Yes, I understand but I specified with the gentleman that I placed my order with that I would like 4 sauces with my meal. \\nWindow Attendant: Ok, I will give you more sauce. (She hands me 1 add'l sauce) This would now equal 3 sauces, and again, not 4. \\nMe: Ok, thank you for this, but may I have another. I don't understand what's going on here. \\nWindow Attendant: Ma'am we now have a 3 sauce limit policy (that isn't displayed anywhere) \\nMe: Are you kidding me? I don't know of any other Chick-Fil- A with this policy. But if this is you policy I understand going forward, but may I have my sauce please. *She was reluctant to give it to me, and she didn't!*\\n\\n(By this time, I've been in the drive thru for 10 min) Long time right..Yeah, I know).

I'm clueless as to why his demeanor would be like this. So I asked him, what was all the attitude for? He then screams at me \\" I'm not rolling my eyes at you, I doing that to something in the back\\". Yeah ok, but this was conveniently after he heard me reference him to the manager. Lol\\nI said this is ridiculous, and dismissed him this is when he begins to shout and yell at me \\" all this shit about a sauce\\"??!! This is exactly what I'm thinking!! I'm the one paying for food at an establishment to only be denied service! I looked at him as if he had lost his mind. He gets so emotional & AGGRESSIVE that he bucks as if he wanted to come towards the window at me. The other workers had to physically remove him from the area. He also ignored his managers request to stand down twice.\\nThere were many witnesses to this ordeal, because the lobby area inside was still open. Which is crazy, because children could've been present! \\n\\n All in all, the manager that evening was the only one that exuded professionalism, and had empathy to the situation.

After asking many people where to take him someone suggested Sambuca. \\nMany of the reviews were iffy, but we still went this past Friday. IT WAS FABULOUS!! We had reservations at 7.30 and we walked right to our tables. \\nService was good, but I think many people failed to realize in other reviews, that it's a jazz bar/cafe. Many people want to be just left alone to enjoy who they are with or at least the music. The food was exquisite!! Thank you Sambuca to making my mom jealous!! It turned out to be a great evening. I highly suggest to anyone going on a date, going out with friends, or even taking a family member out. It was a good clean atmosphere which is very hard to find it seems, in downtown Atlanta area."},{"name":"Boston Common Coffee Co.","address":"515 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here to begin my in-Boston jobsearch, as I don't have wireless where I'm staying.

There were about ten tables in all, and at least eight of then were taken too, which is always a good sign. The crowd ranged from a group of early-20s kids, to a young family, and a few older groups. \\n\\nThe decor was about par, with a few specials in Chinese printed out on pink sheets hung on the walls, a few framed prints, and Christmas lights still up (but mercifully turned off). The requisite tank for showcasing the fruits de mer was actually empty, which I thought peculiar. \\n\\nThe guy server was quite helpful in making recommendations through the fairly extensive menu, and accommodating my desire not to splurge spontaneously on abalone and shark-fin on a Tuesday evening whim. A lady server was a bit snappier whenever she came to (try and) help. \\n\\nI opted for the pu-erh tea, which came out fairly weak. I had to let it steep for the duration of the meal before it took on some semblance of flavour and colour. \\n\\nIn terms of food, most noodle and rice dishes were south of the $15 mark, and I ultimately opted for the pork ribs with green pepper and the mixed vegetable with almond. Creeping the other tables, the Peking Duck looked quite lovely, and the group seemed to have dug it thoroughly too. \\n\\nAs far as my meal goes, the vegetables came out with a selection of bok choi, broccoli, beans, celery, carrot, and, oddly enough, no almonds - instead, there was a smattering of cashews instead. Vegetables could have benefitted from more robust seasoning, as they tasted a bit bland, and came out a touch soggy. The non-almond cashews came out a little stale as well. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the ribs with green pepper came out with about three roughly chopped chunks of green pepper, a few chunks of red pepper, and a more than generous heap of canned pineapple and onion. The ribs were fried pleasantly crisp, though the dish came out a bit on the saccharine side and a little bit too vinegar-y. Meanwhile, the heap of canned pineapple on the dish alternated between either too-sweet (almost like preserved pineapple candy) or too-tart (vinegar tart, not fresh pineapple tart) with a bit of a foreign after-taste. \\n\\nThe meal was rounded out with a complimentary helping of tapioca pearls, which is normally one of my favourite desserts. Unfortunately, this one left a few things to be desired, coming out a bit too thin and leaving a bit of an after-taste resembling burnt milk. \\n\\nIn total, with HST, the tab came to a few pennies under $29. On food alone, I would give this place two stars, but I decided to kick it up one because the server was pretty helpful. \\n\\nCurious to try that Peking Duck next time, but a bit nervous having had their green pepper ribs that lacked adequate green pepper, and their almond vegetables that wholly lacked almond..."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I absolutely loved this restaurant!

They looked happy, which was a good sign. It looked like a family style place. The sofas seemed a little aged, which showed its popularity. If everything still looked very new, I would be skeptical about the business. \\nThe waitress was an old lady, who noticed me and my friend right away after we entered. She signaled me to choose my spot. We decided to sit down by the door. After she bought us the water, she asked if we needed more time to go over the menu. Yes, everything on the menu was with a picture and looked pretty good to me. We then ordered only two simple dishes: the seafood pancake and stirred noodle with veggies. \\nThe metal utensils were cleanly kept in a plastic box. This is the first time I saw restaurant keep chopsticks in an enclosed container. \\nDishes came out fairly quick and she also gave us 4 small appetizers and a small bowl of white rice. I have attached the photos to this review. They all tasted great! The only imperfection was the soy sauce came with the 4 appetizers. I wish they could have brought us low sodium version. But I didn't need to put the sauce in my pancake.  I don't like salty dishes and that's the main problem I encountered in America that most people here like heavy sauce. The two dishes also looked not too oily but not too dry either, just about right. The lady came to our table to check if dishes were all right. I gave her a big thumb up! The portion is perfect for two. Usually I can eat a lot but I prefer to eat light at night so I couldn't finish everything so we packed home.

It was our first time dining here (or any Morton's location for that matter) and it was really special. Obviously, this place is really pricey and meant for special occasions. Having said that, my dining experience was all that I expected it to be, given the price and hype around Morton's nationwide.\\n\\nService: This is a fine dining establishment and the service lives up to that expectation. I'm talking the whole nine yards: From the valet opening the restaurant's door for you, to the hostess who pulls out your table to make it easier for you to enter your booth, to the servers who keep your water filled all night long...this place pays attention to detail and recognizes the importance of impeccable service as a fine dining establishment. My actual server, Patrick, was very professional, knowledgable, and helpful. After my boyfriend and I told Patrick that this is our first time dining here, he took the time to highlight some of his favorite offerings from the different sections of the menu. In addition, Patrick explained the different cuts of meats and highlighted some of Morton's seasonal offerings as well. I really appreciated that he took the time to explain all of this, as I was able to be much more informed before making my decision about what to eat.\\n\\nFood: High quality, delicious, and flavorful. Those are the three words I would use to describe my meal at Morton's. For a starter, we ordered bacon wrapped scallops with a side of apricot chutney. Patrick told us that it normally comes with three scallops and asked if we wanted another scallop for us to have an even amount each (much appreciated!). The scallops were as heavenly (and as huge) as I expected. The bacon added a smokey element to the dish, and the scallops were moist, tender, and well-seasoned. The apricot chutney also added another layer of complexity to the dish, though I didn't use much of it on my scallop. \\n\\nNow onto the meat: My boyfriend decided to order the seasonal Wagyu steak (8 oz, $79) while I ordered the New York Strip (16 oz, $59). My New York Strip was to die for. It had a nice crunch on the top from a perfectly even sear, which really complemented the juicy, tender (with still enough chew to make it a hardy piece of meat), and buttery flavor of the steak. Just thinking about it now makes my mouth water! I also had a piece of my boyfriend's Wagyu and man oh man was it tender. I think my steak was cooked a little better, though I was really impressed with how much softer the Wagyu was, even compared to my already tender steak. \\n\\nFor our side, we chose their sour cream mashed potatoes ($13). I wasn't sure if one side would be enough for us, but it was a pretty large portion. The mashed potatoes were extremely rich and creamy, and I could definitely taste the sour cream in there. It was nicely seasoned as well, and I particularly enjoyed dipping it in the pool of juices (read: blood) on my steak plate. \\n\\nTo finish off our meal, we ordered the blueberry bread pudding, which came with a side of vanilla ice cream. We were already stuffed, but was somehow able to finish it off! I'm a huge fan of bread pudding and this one was extremely moist. The blueberries in the bread pudding were sweet and really complimented the blueberry glaze on the top. The vanilla ice cream was also a nice addition (how can you really go wrong with ice cream?)\\n\\nUltimately, dining at Morton's is an experience that I will never forget. From the impeccable service to my perfectly cooked steak, everything was spot on. I couldn't have been happier with my anniversary dinner!\\n\\nPS: Cocktails are $15 each and the Key Lime Pie cocktail literally tasted like key lime pie in a glass.

Maybe they are trying to cater more to Vegetarians and Vegans or maybe they are just doing some cost cutting, but there is very little protein available here.   \\nThe pastas are not special either.  They are generally very bland, but I do enjoy the Lemon and Caper pasta they do during lemon month.  I also like the penne arribiata because this is a spicy pasta so it actually has some good flavor, though it is not as spicy as other arribiatas I've had.  \\nThe real star here are the soups.  This past time I enjoyed a three cheese tortellini and the time before that Albidongas Locas, which was nice and spicy.  My favorite is by far and away the Cream of Rosemary Potato.  I love soup and this is one of my favorites anywhere.  My friend Melissa raves about their clam chowder and this is why most of my visits are on Friday, so she can get clam chowder. \\nThe breads here are also nice.  I recently enjoyed a gluten free pumpkin muffin, a gluten free coconut muffin, and a maple muffin.  The 4 cheese focaccia is always yummy and they have it every day.  It is basically cheese pizza. My friend Kari loves their blueberry and banana nut muffins.   \\nThe best time to go though is during Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup month, which generally seems to be in March.  The tomato soup is very good and the grilled cheese focaccia dippers are the best thing since sliced bread.    \\nCheck their website for coupons and to see what soups are available before you go."},{"name":"La Fruta Feliz","address":"3124 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"what beautifully crafted tacos...the corn tortillas are tasteful and sturdy, which helps hold in the huge portion of meat.

Sam Lagrassa's is the East Coasts version of Langers in Los Angeles.  However Sams keeps it different with the addition of a chipotle mustard.  Another difference is that Langers bread is crusty but the middle is very soft, at Sam's the bread is toasted.  Walking into sams it is a bit intimidating, you order and then you stand and wait for your sammy, it is fast but for people who have never been there, the ordering process is slightly confusing.  Once we sat down, we pretty much inhaled our sandwich, it is a meal in itself, you do not need any sides with it.  The pastrami melts in your mouth, you get a zing from the mustard, and the coleslaw just transforms the sandwich.\\n\\nOverall Sam's is a great place to come for a pastrami sandwich, i dint look at the rest of their menu, but if you come here, order the pastrami."},{"name":"Bombay Grill","address":"2165 Savoy Dr","city":"Chamblee","stars":"3.5","text":"Many people remember Bombay grill from its previous owners but it reopened under new ownership in 2015 and it's been completely renovated. \\n\\nThe decor is much nicer than most other Indian restaurants in Atlanta and the food is fantastic"},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It was a small place but aside from that the food did not lack at all.

At least I hope not, because I regularly make these claims. If you haven't yet been to Pok Pok, here is my guide for beginners:\\n\\nIt's all about timing. I've been to Pok Pok and waited 3 hours for a table. I've also been seated without a wait several times. The secret is showing up early on in the dinner rush (in the vicinity of 5:00) and whenever possible coming on weekdays. But if this doesn't work for your schedule, don't fret. You can wait out the wait across the street at Whiskey Soda Lounge, another of Andy Ricker's restaurants. While there, grab a drink and order some appetizers.\\n\\nSpeaking of drinks, drinking vinegar! I had never heard of drinking vinegar prior to Pok Pok, but now I can't get enough. It's a sort of milder version of kombucha that is worth trying at least once. I highly recommend the Thai Basil drinking vinegar. If you're in a boozier mood, their Tamarind Whiskey Sour is stupid good.\\n\\nWhen you finally are seated, you'll be faced with a menu that probably looks a lot like gibberish to first time Pok Pokers. I mean, wtf is Khanom Jiin Kaeng Whiaw Waan Luuk Chin Plaa? (yes, that is a single menu item). For this reason, I strongly recommend relying on the wisdom of the servers. Let him or her know your dietary restrictions (vegetarian, shellfish allergy, etc.) and interests (noodles, easily shared, etc.) and you'll be introduced to a slew of menu items that work for you. I specifically recommend the following items:\\n\\n-Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (SPICY): Pok Pok is super famous for these. You can also order them across the street at Whiskey Soda Lounge.\\n-Sunny's Yam Wun Sen: I'm a huge fan of this noodle dish that has an excellent cumulative spice. The sauce is a perfect combination of lime, garlic, fish sauce, and vinegar.\\n-Het Paa Naam Tok: This is probably the finest vegetarian item on the menu. It's an amazing, spicy mushroom salad. Worth it for vegetarians but also omnivores.\\n-Phat Khanaeng: A great fried brussels sprouts dish that can be made with fish sauce or vegetarian.\\n-Muu Paa Kham Waan: It's really hard to pick a favorite dish at Pok Pok, but this is probably mine. It's an amazingly tender boar collar dish served with a spicy sauce and mustard greens.\\n\\nYou should make sure you order lots of rice (either jasmine rice or sticky rice) to accompany your food. It not only works well to soak up all the delicious juices left behind from your food, but serves to cool off your mouth after eating way too much spicy food.\\n\\nI'm also aware that Pok Pok has a dessert menu, though for the life of me I don't know how people ever have room for it. The groups that I have come with always just keep ordering more dishes until nobody can eat anymore.\\n\\nAnd that's Pok Pok. I can't wait to return again and again."},{"name":"Finale","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Meh. It's okay.

My husband wanted to try Pap Joe's as he remembered loving it when he was a kid visiting his cousins in Vancouver. We ordered up two mediums and some wings. Way too much for the tow of us, but I like variety. The pizza arrived really quickly, which was super nice and everything was piping hot. The pizzas were so heavy! The thick crust was loaded generous amounts of toppings. The sauce was a sweet marinara that was a little overpowering for me, but my husband really liked it. The cheese was fresh and not of the processed variety which is a plus in my book. All in all, a good pizza.\\n\\nBut I could only give Papa Joe's three stars because of the wings. They were obviously baked, not fired and thus a bit soggy. And they were still dripping with grease. I can deal with baked wings if they are moderately more healthy than their fried counterparts, but greasy and soggy did not make me happy.

Admittedly, there is an over-gratuitous use of krab on the belt at times and the quality can be hit or miss; on top of that, the prices are higher than at other similar places.  But at least you can order from the menu and get something pretty tasty, and you can order some pretty decent calamari from the menu (usually something worth getting in my opinion).\\n\\nWith that said, how can I justify giving this place four stars?  Simple, their happy hour is really good and can say that I'm a fan of it.  Usually, I'll go at 3:30-4:00 and I've usually gotten there when they've just put out a bunch of new plates and get a whole bunch of pretty good sushi at their happy hour pricing (buy a drink and it's $1.85 for all plates on the belt except for red plates which remain at $1.30).  And if they haven't put out new plates, usually the stuff is mostly fresh or they will soonish.  Normally, I'll get 7-8 plates of decent sushi, be more than content, and will only have to pay $20; not a bad deal in my mind.\\n\\nOnce again, this is a conveyor belt sushi place, but for me, it's one of the better ones.

The not-so-good:  our one dozen Appy hour oysters (chef's choice - that day was the royal miyagi) was a mixed bag: Most very good, a couple I wondered if they should have served it - black as they were.

The first time I called to ask if they had any books by a few particular authors I collected, they mentioned that they could only look for three authors at a time on a phone order. I mentioned three semi-obscure French writers, all members of a particular small literary group. When the clerk returned to the phone, she told me what they had by those authors [far more than any ordinary shop ever had] and then mentioned that her manager had said I would probably want to know about some other books they had. She then listed a dozen or so by a couple of toher members of the same literary gorup. I was quite impressed both that they made the extra effort to seek out other items of interest and that the manager was that knowedgable about relationships among European writers who are far from household names in this country. Both the service and the expertise characterized all my subsequent dealings with Powell's.

It was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  It won the James Beard award for Best Chef in the Pacific Northwest and they have even recently expanded to New York City (I actually walked by their New York location on the way to wd~50 on a recent trip).\\n\\nI do worry about ethnic food outside of major metros though so I did have some reservations coming in--not because I'm a purist or traditionslist or anything like that.  I am all about chefs doing things differently (and not necessarily tied to their ethnicity) as long as it is true to who they are or what they want to create.  It is just that when I have tried these highly regarded places in smaller cities, they have just been disappointing--not sure what the reason is (maybe these restaurants in smaller cities just do not have access to ingredients like restaurants in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles do).\\n\\nI only had a few things at Pok Pok, but what I did have delivered good flavors.  Their caramelized wings were very good.  They had a very crispy exterior while the inside was juicy.  The wings were incredibly messy and they had a very strong flavor.  It was equal parts spicy, sweet, hot, acidic, and garlicky.\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pok-pok-portland?select=I13N5hUk6_GG2cIwvoxA6A#zKGGqyjmCc4vmIoWWNlaUg\\n\\nI also had the wild boar, which was good as well. The meat had a good flavor and was juicy and tender.  The meat was sauced in a similar way as the chicken wings.  While the boar was not sweet, it was definitely spicy, hot, acidic, and garlicky.  You pick up the wild boar strips in chilled mustard greens and the refreshing and cool greens were really needed to balance out the flavorful and the strongly sauced wild boar.  Overall, it was a good dish, but I wish I had ordered something else since the wings and boar had similar flavor profiles.\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pok-pok-portland?select=I13N5hUk6_GG2cIwvoxA6A#ExkMpik-VkUrHD6FgixpHg\\n\\nDessert was a letdown.  I had their fritters, which came with an affogato of sweetened condensed milk ice cream drenched in coffee.  The fritters were crispy but were surprisingly bland.  They were not sweet so they definitely did not work as a dessert.  They would also not work as a savory dish.  The sweetened condensed milk ice cream was rich, smooth and really tasted of sweetened condensed milk.  Too bad the coffee almost completely melted it.\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pok-pok-portland?select=I13N5hUk6_GG2cIwvoxA6A#vQQFi4gur59kRDmWn4LXIw\\n\\nService was good.  The food came out at a quick pace and the server / bartender was casual and friendly but also professional, polite and attentive.\\n\\nPrices are good.  Pok Pok might be more expensive than most Thai restaurants, but given portion sizes and the restaurant's excellent reputation, I thought the prices were reasonable.\\n\\nPok Pok has a real funky feel in terms of atmosphere.  There is an outdoor area with lots of vegetation and for some reason the indoor dining area with its cluttered look and decoration really reminded me of a tiki bar.\\n\\nPok Pok is a fun spot.  I do not have much experience with Thai food, but I found Pok Pok noticeably better than the few Los Angeles Thai restaurants I have tried.  I would say Las Vegas' Lotus of Siam serves better Thai food than Pok Pok though.  Still, I would say Pok Pok is worth at least one try if you live in Portland.  If you are only visiting Portland though, you may want to check out their menu before giving them a try for lunch or dinner.\\n\\nPok Pok is located in a residential area.

Other choices of noodles are available if pho isn't your thing: There's vermicelli and the wonton egg noodles.  Comes in 3 different sizes: Regular, Large and X-Large.  X-Large guarantees an average, starving, big appetite student a full stomach for at least the next 4-5 hours at a price of approximately $9, not to mention the signature beef burp smell.

The crazy lady giving the tour did not have any stories except new ones that happened during her tour the day before. And I felt like we were solicitors as some places seemed annoyed of our presence while others wouldnt even let us in. Never again. However, the good thing that came from that experience was finding Moonshine. What a beautiful building! So well taken care of and always a treat to walk through. I especially love the outside bar and patio. After our frightening :) ghost tour we sat in the outdoor bar and had a few dinks and the Corndog Shrimp app. So so so good!

Had my birthday party there last year and we all had such a wonderful time - the best birthday yet! They also have a wonderful brunch, but I prefer the dinner here (I am not partial to buffets and do not enjoy the binge, but if I were into buffets this would be one of them). Went to dinner here a few days ago on Halloween (we are making this an annual thing) and it was outstanding! I love the seasoned popcorn they start you off with. We ordered a few local beers on their menu and of course our beloved corndog shrimp. We gave into the pumpkin chowder which was out of this world with lots of yummy pumpkin seeds. My boyfriend and I split the Bison Meatloaf which had this rich, gamey flavor that melted in your mouth. This was topped by a delicate gravey with mushrooms. It came with a blackbean and corn salad and steamed carrots and zucchini lush and rich from local texas farms.

Though there is something just a little disconcerting about this place, and I'm not referring to the long wait (but what breakfast joint in Portland doesn't?), tart syrups (however advised so by our helpful waitress), and tepid tabletop griddles (coated in canola). The feeling I get reminds me of the scene from Labyrinth where Jennifer Connolly's character, drugged and disoriented from being thrown off her search, finds herself escorted into the familiar safety of her bedroom. Just as she starts to let go and fall into the comfort of all her favorite objects, she realizes that it's not really her bedroom, it's just made to resemble it and only distract her further.

You wait because though the list is long, the large, open atmosphere begs you to stay. Its brightly accented with skylights so us sun-starved Northwesterns don't fall into further despair. The whole place is so Portland with its rustic modern seating, cutely patterned with a punchy Sixties print enclosed by blocky wooden booths and tables.

Had a salted plum vodka collins(YUM), some famous fish sauce wings (YUM), Phat See Ew (YUM) and some sort of eggplant salad thing (mostly yum as well, but an oddly extremely fishy first bite). The service was great, the food was tasty (albeit overpriced for the portion sizes), and there were leftovers for later.\\nThe next day I received a text from my dining companion that was a picture of a slug in one of the take-out boxes from our lunch. Turns out the little fellow hitch-hiked on a piece of lettuce and survived the refrigerator as well. (insert vomit noises here). Everyone knows that slugs live in the garden and can therefore end up in your salad. You know, those things just happen sometimes. A phone call was made to Pok Pok to report the sighting, and an apology for the slug was made. And that's it. Something about having spent $60 on a lunch and finding a slug in the leftovers makes me feel like they should have offered a complimentary appetizer on our next visit.

We arrived at 1PM on a rainy Sat. The wait was not terrible. The hostess was very nice. We were seated at half of a small folding table for 4 with the other half already occupied - a bit disappointing. The Wal-Mart folding chairs were also unimpressive. It appeared as though the only \\"decent\\" seating is in the bar area. The rest is more or less covered outdoor area with plastic curtains for walls in inclement weather. Maybe this is Portland-chic but it sort of said --- our food is so good that you'll be willing to tolerate high-school picnic seating. Except......it's really not. \\n\\nServer was sufficiently pleasant but taciturn. We had no idea there were any specials until we heard a nearby server tell his table about them. Our server was willing to take our order, but was not about to volunteer any help with a fairly extensive and potentially confusing menu. \\"Do you guys have any questions...\\" may have been nice. Food arrived quickly and at proper temperature.\\n\\nThe \\"fish sauce wings\\" were very good but not \\"Oh-Wow!\\". Wings were large. The taste of fish sauce could have been more obvious IMO. Spicy was not particularly so. But --this was the stand out dish of our visit. Still - overpriced at $14 for six wings. (8.5/10)\\n\\nThe half-hen was more like a half-sparrow. Absurdly small portion netting +/- 1/3  cup of meat. The dipping sauces were good. The sticky rice was different from what I am accustomed to (rather brick-like) but good. The hen was dry, the lemon grass \\"stuffing\\" (got less than a tsp. of it) tasted like lemony lawn mower droppings. Not even a hint of garlic or cilantro. Honestly a rotisserie chicken at the supermarket is lots better. (1/10)\\n\\nThe boar collar was good but was more or less kind of gristly, fatty, braised meat with green curry paste on top. My son is 19, kind of a foodie, and he felt that the flavoring was excessively intense. Upon reflection I kind of agree -- but it was not so much the intensity of the flavors as the fact that the \\"curry paste\\" was more or less just spooned on top of the meat rather than being an intrinsic component of the dish. Portion size on the boar collar was not as silly as the half-hummingbird but still VERY small. (6/10)\\n\\nI had one beer, my son had water and it was still $55 for essentially 3 appetizers. I definitely felt like I got less than I paid for. \\n\\nWould I go back?? If I knew I could get a seat in the bar - maybe.

The only thing I would recommend is the chicken chili. But consistency is a major issue. I used to come in and get a cup to go--it was delicious with the melted cheese on top, some hot sauce sprinkled in, and that cheesy jalapeno bread on the side. So, when I had friends suggest we dine in for lunch there, I was excited. If the chicken chili is that good when I order it to go, it must be great when prepared for me to eat right then and there, right? Wrong.

Expensive restaurant with its prices? Seems like people either look for one or the other, but who knows...\\n\\nThe food is good. I'd give that 4-5 stars. I had the pulled pork/green chile tacos (a little light on the green chile though) and the chorizo breakfast taco. No problem there. The chili con queso was also outstanding.\\n\\nNow contrast that with the prices - we're talking about $3.50 for your average taco with no sides whatsoever. Buy two of these, and you're in the price range for a sit-down dinner at most local Tex-Mex joints - not to mention that rice and beans as a side are about $2/each. Want chips/salsa like you get for free in sit down places? Another $3.50.\\n\\nFrom a value perspective, it rates VERY low - I'd give it two stars at best. I know that some people will take exception to my rating and aren't concerned about the price, so if you're primarily concerned with the quality of the tacos and don't mind paying a premium, then no problem - you'll love the place. I can't decouple the perceived value of what I'm getting from the overall experience though.\\n\\n[ETA] I was just reminded of the \\"value\\" proposition when I went to my local hole-in-the-wall place for breakfast tacos.

It's great for any mood: a sunny romantic brunch in the Fenway area, or even a fun, refined yet relaxed evening to watch a sports game. You will have a great view of oysters being shucked at one end and the beautiful bar with marine-themed accents to fill in the rest. Add some great music and service, and you have a killer ambience. \\n\\nStart with a cocktail or drink of choice - ICOB offers a wide array of fun and complex refreshments to keep you entertained. \\n\\nLet's talk about the food.  \\n\\nOyster Sliders. \\nIncredible. Perfect, crunchy batter for the oyster nestled inside a bed of buttery bread goodness. Would be satisfied to have a meal comprised of solely this. \\n\\nBlue Fish Sandwich (Brunch special) \\nGood, but the bread was too thick and ultimately overwhelming. Could not taste the fish as hoped. \\n\\nOysters \\nIf you like oysters, they have a great selection. Try the restaurant title oyster, and if you aren't sure what else to get, ask the knowledgeable and friendly staff. \\n\\nFreshly Baked Pastry Basket \\nWe were starving and needed something sweet to go with our savory seafood brunch, so we indulged in this selection of pastries. \\n\\nClam Chowder \\nAnother great New England Clam Chowder. Not sure if it's Boston's best, and we wish the biscuit could have been larger. However, we're thankful that the kitchen split up the soup for us since we were sharing. \\n\\nLobster Roe Noodles \\nOrdered this because of all the rave reviews on Yelp, and we will say right now, this was not a great dish for our taste. First off, there is no roe on the pasta, which we were expecting. Instead, the pasta is made with roe, which actually makes the pasta taste quite salty. Also, it's fairly strange having lobster and braised short rib all thrown together and served over noodles. Pasta, Lobster, and Braised short ribs are all things we love, but the combination was not sophisticated enough and led to a confusing meal. Would pass up.   \\n\\nBanoffee Pie \\nThis English dessert specialty surpassed expectations. The combination of banana, fresh whipped cream, and caramel stacked on a phenomenal thick crust really lent itself to being the perfect dessert.

The meat could have been a little more juicy and chopped more finely. They were all out of chicken (not sure how that happens) and deviled eggs so we didn't get to try those.

Shigezo is one such.  It's not really an Izakaya in the classic sense, since there's also ramen, sushi and donburi.  But it is the izakaya menu -- that is, all the little Japanese pub bites -- which are what really shine about this place.\\n\\nHaving read and heard the complaints about the sushi, we decided to do entirely pub food.  Besides, they seated us at the robata grill, and it would have been a missed opportunity to not order a bunch of grilled skewers, which we did.  Dinner consisted of takikomi, grilled squid, skewers of shishito, pork cheeks, tsukune, and zucchini, the \\"carrot tower\\" salad, kabocha tempura, and \\"ebi\\" mayo.  Plus beer.  The standouts were the shishitos, the pork cheeks, and the salad, which were all off the regular menu so go for them.

The decor and the setting were pretty stereotypical - lots of Japanese artwork and paper lanterns. What really irked me about the interior design, however, was the butterflies. As my dear friend and roommate Kelsey F. (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LsFlXfAPxZpJYBx1GMHIzw) can testify, I have an aversion to butterfly patterns and artwork. It makes my skin crawl.

Yikes. \\n\\nI must say that I was pretty amused by the musical selection - a little Chris Brown, some J. Lo, and a playlist of poppy head-nodding tunes that you accidentally know all the words to. Oh and did I mention that they have TVs throughout that were airing ESPN? Talk about a true hodge podge of cultural delight.\\n\\nAs far as the buffet goes, I was pretty impressed with the variety. There were about 7 or 8 different sushi rolls from which to choose including spicy tuna, California roll, veggie roll, Mexican roll, and a few tempura rolls. They also had sashimi with tuna, salmon, and snapper. I can't say that this tasted like the highest quality of sushi that I've tasted, but it was decent. The consistency was a bit dry and crumbly for my liking. But it is more of a \\"bargain\\" joint, after all.\\n\\nThey also had a little salad bar with assorted veggies, a hot food area with standard Asian dishes (i.e. beef and broccoli, lo mein-ish selections, etc.),and a dessert area with little doughnuts, brownies, and pastries. The sugarry fried banana option received mixed reviews from the members of our table, but I was too intimidated by the concept to give it a go. My favorite part of the experience? The unlimited supply of seaweed salad. It wasn't the best that I've ever had, but it was definitely good enough for me to go back for seconds.\\n\\nWhile I was there, I happened to notice a sign promoting karaoke on Saturday from 9:00pm-12:00am.

The larger tables in the far end of the spare space are perfectly arranged were almost fully occupied. \\n\\nOur bartender seemed a little tired...but (having worked in the service industry before) I know what a 7pm bar shift on a Sunday feels like. Still, I wish that she was a little more enthusiastic about the cocktail/menu selections. There seemed to be a \\"team approach\\" to the bar area and we probably spoke to 4 staff members throughout our stay. The cocktails were inventive (and extensive) and the variation on a Manhattan that I ordered was served 'down' in a frosted rocks glass (it's the little things). \\n\\nThe fried oyster sliders are amazing...perfectly sized, perfectly presented, and perfectly executed. I ordered the lobster roll as an entree and I must admit it was one of the best I've ever had. Even the coleslaw (and fries that I substituted) were exceptional. \\n\\nIsland Creek is one of those restaurants those you just feel \\"cool\\" or \\"sexy\\" sitting in. There was a great \\"high/low\\" kind of crowd on Sunday evening...a group of women dressed to the nines, a few older Beacon Hill couples, and euro-looking students...and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Well done Island Creek."},{"name":"Pepper Lunch","address":"5951 No 3 Road, Unit 150","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"It's a nice spot for a quick lunch. \\n\\nThe portions are larger. Too much rice though, being a vegetarian the menu is a bit restricted"},{"name":"Cantina Laredo","address":"1680 29th St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Cantina Laredo is a chain of casual/upscale Mexican-fusion establishements, which, I think, began in Texas. \\n\\nIf you've never been to Mexico, let me enlighten you about what authentic food is from there. Okay, so that's being presumptuous of me, because it all depends. Dishes from every country will vary from region to region, time of year (what available ingredients are at hand), who is making what, etc., etc..  \\n\\nMost good chefs want to be creative and will expand on something most people think of as traditional or wuthentic. There's down-home dishes, and then there are more creative ones. So, if someone claims a place isn't authentic, it might be because the chef is not strictly sticking to one type of style. Authentic food really depends on what part of whatever country you are in, or ordering from. If you're near a coastal area, the dishes will likely include more seafoods. If you're near a lake or river, think freshwater ingredients. More inland areas usually include more beef, pork, chicken, etc.. So, don't be fooled by people who say this place isn't authentic, because you can certainly get traditional Mexican dishes here, but that wasn't why I chose it. I would have come anyway, mostly for the Ahi Tuna Tacos.\\n\\nAtmosphere and decor though are another thing. The interior of the Boulder, CO Cantina Laredo reminds of the California Pizza Kitchen across the street. It's failry bright, clean and modern. Nothing off-putting at all. \\n\\nParking can be tricky here depending on time of day, day of the week, and the weather. However, there's plenty of free parking on the sides, in the underground lot across the street, and other lots very close by.\\n\\nOur server, Rogelio, was pretty good, not great but good. he took our orders quickly and served us quickly too. My only complaint was he never came back to ask how our dishes were, but we didn't really have anything to complain about anyway.\\n\\nThe menu hasn't changed much in the 4 years I've come here, but then I've only come a few times before, mostly because there are so many good Mexican restaurants in Boulder to choose from. However, I knew my daughter had never been here, and I was carving one of their signature dishes, the Ahi Tuna Tacos.\\n\\nI orginally tried to show up around 6:30, for Happy Hour, as I'd been here before for HH and found the food and service very good. However, tonight, we, my younger daughter and I, arrived about 10 minutes before 7 and placed our order 5 minutes before it ended, so we only managed to get our Casa Ritas in under the cutoff. The HH Ritas tasted watered down though. After two of them, and two is normally my limit for anything alcoholic, I barely noticed a buzz off them. My daughter was driving, so she only had one, but her's too was weak. However, they were cold, wet and refreshing none the less. \\n\\nAfter our margs arrived, we ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos to start, which I knew to be good, and the made-at-your-table guac. My daughter found the tuna tacos strange, but I liked them. The  guac was excellent, though they use garlic powder as opposed to fresh garlic. Anyway, our guac was free with a Payback coupon I had, but normally it's over priced, IMO, but then I think all restaurants overcharge for guacomole. It was a healthy portion though.\\n\\nMy daughter ordered the Ensalada de Mango y Pollo (salad with chicken, mango, jicama, mixed lettuces, etc.), in a light vinegrette dressing, which didn't over power the dish. My daughter and I both found it very good, very fresh ingredients, and delightfully different for an early March dish. I would absolutly order this again. \\n\\nI ordered the Enchilada combo (beef and chicken), because my daughter asked me to. She wanted my leftovers for lunch tomorrow. For the serving size and quailty, I thought they were over priced, and just ok in taste. I liked the chicken one better, she liked them both. We were pretty full by the time our entrees arrived though, so over half of them came home with us. I wouldn't order these again though. Well maybe the chicken on, but certainly not the beef one. \\n\\nThe chips here are another thing I like. They are thin and not greasy, but they are also so thin that scooping guac and salsa can be challenging. I'd reather have them thin than greasy though."},{"name":"The Creperie On Newbury","address":"259 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm giving this place a 2 because the food is pretty decent.

It's restaurants like this that resurrect the notion that well-executed food, competent service staff, and an exceptional dining experience still exist in this city. In fact, the meat at Kevin Rathbun Steak is so glorious and utterly delicious that I'm confident it would convert even the most tofu-iest of vegetarians to the carnivorous persuasion.\\n\\nFood: Kevin Rathbun Steak applies a welcomed twist of innovation to traditional American steakhouse fare. The menu is comprised of both hot and cold appetizers, salads and soups, U.S.D.A. prime meats, seafood, and alternative meat selections. Given my unwavering commitment to the P.I.G., I opted for the grilled thick-cut bacon and pimento stuffed bacon puffs for appetizers, both of which were outstanding. The sriracha-molasses glaze on the thick-cut bacon was particularly impressive. For an entr√©e, I had the 12 ounce Berkshire pork chop, which was accompanied by cheddar grits, braised greens, and an apple and sage puree. The pork chop was perfectly cooked to order and was unequivocally the best I've had at any restaurant in Atlanta. For sides, my dining partner and I opted for the elbow mac n' cheese tart and the parmesan fries, both of which were flavorful, but not overly impressive.  \\n\\nService: Extremely personable, proficient, and knowledgeable. In particular, the communication between the waiter and the bussers was among the best I've seen.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: Modern, open, and welcoming. This is not your grandfather's steakhouse - if you're looking for a dismal, dungeon-like experience, I'd recommend dining elsewhere.  \\n\\nCost: Expensive by most standards, but completely justified by the food quality. Appetizers are $9-$20, soups and salads are $9-$13, fish and shellfish are $27-$48, steaks are $30-$60, alternative meat entrees are $18-$48, and sides are $7.50 each.\\n\\nOther: Valet parking is compulsory, but complimentary.

Located in the South Campus Gateway, this place has a niche for a decent tap selection and advertises itself as a Tex-Mex type restaurant.  It may be a starting point for a lot of groups going bar hopping downtown, but it isn't packed to the point where it's extremely difficult to order a drink.\\n\\nThere are TV's all around the bar if you want to watch a primetime sports event whether it's the NBA, MLB, College Football, or International Football (Soccer).  A bit of something for everyone whether you're the Mexican supporters or diehard Buckeye fans.  If sports isn't your thing (kind of hard in this town, right?), there is plenty of dining room seating and the patio to provide a nice atmosphere.\\n\\nThe food portion sizes here are decent and they have a number of vegetarian/vegan options.  Unlike your run of the mill \\"authentic\\" Mexican joints, there are no free chips & salsa.  No worries though, as most food incl. appetizers is 1/2 off after 10 p.m.  This means a ton of nachos w/ fresh ingredients stacked high for 4.50 you can easily can feed 3 people.  No runny salsa or powder guacamole, just the fresh stuff & ready to order nachos the way they should be.    \\n\\nFor any draft or IPA fan, there is a decent selection that includes Dogfish Head 90 Minute and quality craft beer.  Happy hour prices are good starting around 4 p.m., but not all that terrible after if you just want a pint or two.  Frozen margaritas are some of the best around town.  I usually order the 22 oz. Big Azz Margarita...for $6 after 10 p.m ($9.75 regular hrs.) , it's a great deal.  There are a number of flavor options for those that want to try something other than the traditional lime (which is very good as well).  It may be made w/ well house tequila, but having one is enough to give you a nice buzz without being the drunkie your friends have to babysit.\\n\\nWhen I decide to head here, my final tab is usually between $12-20.  Mad Mex is best if you just want to bring a friend or a small group along (3 or 4).  I would advise against huge groups as this backs up the kitchen time to the point where some impatient people will start to grumble at the server.  Service may not be top notch, but have patience.  The more you focus on enjoying conversation with a friend & the margarita, the better your experience will be.

I like Pok Pok... I saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives...\\"\\n\\nPortland is chock full of really good Thai places. Cha Ba Thai on Alberta Street is great (and cheap)... if you want really amazing, try Khun Pic Bahn. That place is the bomb... and is, IMHO, way more authentic than Pok Pok. I can't believe how many Portlanders have been duped by the Pok Pok machine. Andy Ricker (and I'm sure he's a nice guy, nothing personal) has gotten so many accolades for doing what? He went to Thailand a bunch of times and decided to \\"re-create\\" Thai food back here in the states? Whoa. Hold up. No f-in way. You mean to tell me that you're a white guy and you're going to cook Thai food instead of a burger and fries? Is that even possible? I mean, couldn't there be a tear in the very fabric of spacetime with such an audacious move like that? Oh well, if you insist. I guess you'll be needing some hot peppers, limes, and cilantro... and you better cross your fingers just to be safe.\\n\\nI went to Pok Pok years ago, before I lived in PDX... and I kind of bought into the hype. Then, after I moved here and learned about all of the real Thai places, I forgot about Pok Pok. But I thought I'd go back again and check it out. What a let down.\\n\\nI'm a vegetarian that eats seafood sometimes, so I understand that I might be missing out on Pok Pok's signature Boar's Head in a vat of grease, or donkey balls with crispy monkey fingers... but still, there's no excuse for a Thai restaurant that can't serve up some good veggie options. I ordered a simple crab fried rice and a Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles). Both of them were mediocre, at best. The fried rice was dry and had none of the finesse and style of real Thai fried rice... and guess what, I've been to Thailand too. The drunken noodles were bland, and, as another reviewer noted, the portions are teeny-tiny. And here's the kicker. I asked for my dishes to be extra hot (I LOVE spicy food) and the waitress said, \\"these are mild dishes, they don't really come that way.\\"\\n\\nReally? I can't order my Thai food hot? Wow, that's so authentic. I mean, Thai people are known for their aversion to spicy food.\\n\\nMost of the menu is dedicated to eight hundred varieties of single malt scotch (which, strangely enough, I don't really remember as being all that popular in Thailand...). Maybe Pok Pok survives on the \\"trendiness\\" factor. Get your girl to put on her make-up and booty shorts, and head over to Pok Pok for some drinks and food before a night on the town. But even for just sheer hipness, is the inside of Pok Pok really that great? If you like to sit two inches from a stranger, in a cold room with all the charm of a dive bar, maybe.  \\n\\nYou know how black guys invented hip-hop, but Eminem swooped in and picked up all of the awards?

Lobster roe noodles were perfectly cooked with a bit of a chew - the flavor is bland but not in a bad way. It's rich but just not full of powerful flavors. It was good but not amazing.

I mentioned this to the man at the counter, and he assured me I'd love the food-he cited 20 years experience in the business, so I figured if anything, posterity has given him the right to be cocky. \\n\\nHe was totally right.\\n\\nWe started with a caesar salad, and ordered a plate of proscuitto ravioli to split, along with two individual orders of garlic bread. The salad was delicious; normally I shy away from caesar because I can't stand the fishy taste of the anchovie oil. This was light and crisp and really refreshing. I could have eaten that salad all night, and I'm not usually a salad kind of girl. Even the croutons are worthy of praise.\\n\\nThe ravioli was beyond good, in a decadently rich (but not stomach churning) manner. I'm pretty sure it was stuffed with ricotta cheese and caramelized onions, and it just melted in my mouth with the first bite. The servings are pretty generous, so splitting a meal between two people is really easy (and cheap; we only spent $25 for our entire meal, including our drinks). The garlic bread was tasty, but mild and very buttery. I like my garlic with a bit of a kick to it.\\n\\nIt's a small restaurant (I get the vibe they're mostly pretty busy with takeout), so seating is limited. It's a cute little place, but very pizza parlor-ish. So if you're expecting a nice little hole in the wall Italian restaurant with red and white checkered table clothes and little Chianti bottle candle holders, you'll need to look elsewhere. But if red walls, black utilitarian tables and chairs, and empty bottles of San Pellegrino mineral water lining window sills if fine by you, you'll love this place.\\n\\nAll in all, I was impressed enough (and full enough) with my meal to purchase some of their frozen foods to go.

Maybe it's the blasting, and the door opening so much, and if we don't sit by the couches, it's okay...Or so I thought. Unfortunately today's visit just compounded my negative impression. I really wanted to like it, and tried. I ordered egg and cheese on an english muffin. First it took forever to come out, and when it did, I noticed immediately that it had a greasy slab of ham (which I don't eat) on it. After telling the woman at the register that I didn't order meat, she somewhat reluctantly took it back, and the kitchen called me back up in about 30 seconds with a meatless version. I took it even though it seemed like maybe it was the same sandwich, thinking, can't really be the same sandwich. But after a couple bites into it, the gross, overpowering oily meat flavor was still present and I had to toss the whole thing. Had it actually been tasty, I would have been inclined to ask them to make another. But the bread was dry, the cheese was almost nonexistent (maybe stuck to the offending ham slab), and the egg was overly seasoned and yet still tasteless. Also, I had to go to work and since it took about ten minutes to make in the first place, I couldn't sit around and wait. I've been here for lunch too, and it's just eh.

I thought the lobster + avocado + eggs + hollandaise sauce would be overwhelming and heavy, but it wasn't at all.  It was a $20 dish and there was certainly $20 worth of lobster on my plate.  So refreshing to see a small cafe not skimp on the meat, you know what I mean?  I always get my eggs benedict with smoked salmon, but the lobster was a nice twist and I don't know if I can go back to having my smoked salmon after I've tried this!\\nThe pancakes were really good too - HUGE pancakes, but to be honest... nothing beats mistral's lemon poppyseed pancakes .

I'm always excited at the prospect of learning and discovering something new, whether it be about a new author, subject or as it is in many cases a new genre/section of books. Maybe Powell's seems magical because Portland is usually overcast and wet and anything by comparison would seem like a sanctuary, but if you've ever been to Powell's you know this isn't the case. The floors, wood shelves, staircases and organization all scream Portland. There is a great balance of clean, rustic and informal charm that is not worried about looking overly modern or perfect. There is nothing about it that feels forced, fake or plastic. The baristas at the coffee bar, the strategically placed information kiosks and their attendants, the wandering book gnomes and cashiers all fit and fulfill their jobs admirably.

The food runner mixed up all of our orders and the food was delivered together in two buckets so everyone was confused about whose order was whose.  Another server came around to help figure it out and ended up spilling the sauce out of the bag so some of the members of my group became displeased.  I got clams and sausages in Louisiana medium.  Thankfully, the clams were open time and were sizable in comparison to my last visit.  Unfortunately, the sausages were not cut up this time around and the sauce was noticeably saltier than usual.\\n\\nI probably would have given a 2-star rating except the owner and staff was extremely nice."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went here on a Monday night and the place was pretty busy. Opted for a place at the bar since it was a little less crowded. Got the roasted bone marrow appetizer and wow, so amazing. Very rich and flavorful, lots of salt and butter but so worth it. Even took the bones home for my two dogs :)\\n\\nFor dinner, I got the smaller filet with the butternut squash risotto and my friend got the ribeye with some Parmesan fries. The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare and even had a little char on the outside which gave it ridiculous flavor. Super tender. Yum. The risotto was also really good. My friend enjoyed the ribeye as well. The only disappointment was the fries. The ranch they serve them with was watered down and completely lacking flavor. So instead we asked for some b√©arnaise and of course were charge for. The fries themselves tasted like they came right out of the freezer. Super dense. Even the Parmesan was lacking flavor. Could have been better considering how delicious the rest of the food was.

Especially on V day. The chef's knocked this one out of the park. Grilled shrimp wrapped in bacon.....mouth watering. NY strip with arugula.....melted in mouth. pasta fagioli was a little under-seasoned but still good. A little more veggies might have worked better. Tomato-basil soup.....very rich and bursting with tomato flavor. watermelon salad was refreshing, but could have used a few more bleu cheese crumbles and artichoke salad was good as well. Osso bucco was tender, however was a tad dry. Next time the meat should soak in the braising liquid overnight to retain moisture and flavor. risotto was spot on. Salmon had doux sauces, a spinach puree and a romesco sauce. Salmon was perfectly cooked and sauces complimented well. Dessert was a very nice cheesecake and a semifreddo with pistachios was a perfect ending to a wonderful menu.

After 15 min of them looking at us we asked are we getting menu's or is this a buffet. And they told us it was a Brunch buffet . So we had no choice we proceeded to have a good day . They had beacon egg, sausage , chicken and waffles, salmon, chicken and so on. Food was good had no complaints. Here is my other reason for the 1star . The bill came and they charged us $30 for adults and $13 for the kids thank god. But $30 for your basic brunch buffet I thought was ridiculous.

ICOB as they lovingly dub it, hits all those marks. This review is for a dinner experience on 1/28 for my birthday dinner. \\n\\nWe had reservations and had denoted that it was for a birthday, and our table was ready within 3 minutes of our arrival. The decor here is coastal chic I'd say, with white washed wood, metal accents, nautical decor. We later found out it was modeled after one of the owner's garages in his beachhouse, which made perfect sense. Each wall has a different texture, my favorite being the back wall filled with real (bleached) oyster shells. amazing. \\n\\nWe sat towards the back, and our table was nicely set. Then, Michelle C came and introduced herself and we fell in love with her from the get go. What an amazing personality! she was kind, thoughtful and engaging, while never being overbearing or annoying. My menu....was personalized. It said happy birthday! this just amazed me. \\n\\nWe ordered a round of drinks, I had the extra fancy cuz let's face it, it was my birthday and i am =) it was delicious. I had two more over the course of the night haha !\\n\\nThe menu is so creatively done, resembling an oyster order. it folds down, with the top page showing the oysters available that night by region. On the inside, you find apps salads, sandwiches, entrees, etc. Unfortunately, we had apps before dinner at Top of the Hub, which I immediately wished I hadnt since they had some amazing looking option. nevertheless, here's what we ordered that night:\\n\\nClam Chowder: Absolutely exquisite. This chowder was creamy and BURSTING with flavor. The hickory bacon in it really took it over the top for me, I could have had a whole vat of this stuff. Chock full of clams and potatoes, this is a win on all cylinders.\\n\\nLobster Bisque: The only dish that I could have perhaps lived without that night. I ordered this, and after tasting the chowder, wished I had gone down that route. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, just not as amazing as the chowder. It's a broth base, which I wasn't expecting, I thought more of a creamy base since it's a bisque. There was a LOT of lobster in this though, not one spoonful without one or two pieces in it. \\nThe flavors were very good. I would order again....if I had never tried the chowder! \\n\\nWinter Citrus Salad (added shrimp from the raw bar): this was a simple salad, but the lemon poppyseed vinaigrette stole the show. The shrimp addition made it perfect as it just needed that little something extra. \\n\\nEthel's Hot Lobster Roll: Ah, lobster rolls. How I adore thee. and this one....this one. it's THE one. They offer both hot and cold, the cold being more of a salad type roll with the celery and light mayo base. The hot....with the lobster simple pure and drenched in butter. How could you NOT want that? I found myself taking a bite...putting it down and savoring it. The lobster meat was so tender and so flavorful, I didn't want it to end too soon. Served with kettle chips or fries (I went with the fries) and cole slaw. \\n\\nNew Bedford Scallops: Scallops and chorizo are not flavors I'd normally put together, but I'm glad they did. I only had a bite, but the dish was practically licked clean. \\n\\nWe were also offered a little amouse-bouche of their shrimp salad on a taro chip that was divine. I didnt see it on their menu, so I wonder if it's a special or just one of those special offerings. Either way, if it's offered to you, take it! \\n\\nThen, dessert. As stuffed as we were, how can it be a birthday dinner without dessert?! Plus, Michelle C. mentioned there was a house made chocolate ice cream and being an ice cream addict, I had to have it. The table also had the Banoffee Pie, which was graham crust layered with dulce deleche and bananas and cream. They brought that out on a plate with happy birthday written in chocolate sauce and a candle, which I thought was a great touch. \\n\\nRight before we left, Michelle C brought over another birthday surprise in the form of white russian shots to celebrate my bday. SO nice, so genuine and of course, yummalicious. \\n\\nI'll say the food was scrumptious, the place was beautiful, but Michelle C. really made it above and beyond what I expected. She's a server who takes pride in her craft and not only understands the industry, but really loves it. She had recommendations for everything from brunch spots, to jazz lounges, to dive bars and fine dining, and new the ins and outs of all of them including their beer offerings, wine lists, and unique dishes. I work in the hospitality industry and I see a lot of potential in her to become an operations director and/or curator for a major restaurant group someday. \\n\\nKudos to the whole team at ICOB, I will 100% without a doubt be back next time I go to Boston."},{"name":"The Corner Cafe","address":"110 W Orange St","city":"Davenport","stars":"4","text":"Myself and my wife just moved to Davenport, and wanted a quick breakfast before we had to go to the post office.

However, the food start to finish was not even close to being worth the price. We had oysters Rockefeller which were just ok, and the ahi tuna appetizer that honestly just tasted old. Moving on I ordered the filet and lump crab and my boyfriend the strip and shrimp. When our meals arrived they looked cheap and gross- mine was covered in what tasted like miracle whip and a few pieces of shredded (I'm sure canned) crab meat. When I say covered I mean at least a cup of the goop. After I scraped everything off to see my filet it was awful too. Overcooked and stringy. I don't think either of us took more than two bites of our entrees. We both work in the industry so complaining is truly the last thing on our minds but this time our meal couldn't go unlooked. We spoke to the manager, paid our full tab which was $120 and tipped 50% even though our meal had nothing to do with or sever. The quality of food was terrible and this place has gone way down hill.

I also ordered the spicy crawfish roll and let me tell ya, their Japanese spicy sauce is made of -- wasabi! I'm not a fan of wasabi and so I could only force myself to eat one bite and I was done with that one. The volcano roll is essentially a california roll topped with scallops and a type of hot sauce and then baked. This is not what I got; what I got instead was a california roll topped with a bunch of chopped zucchini? It was weird, and again, I could only eat one bite. \\n\\nI ordered a drink, also, and it was made at the bar and remained at the bar for about 20-25 minutes just sitting there. One of the three or four that was servicing our table finally noticed it and asked the other waitresses whose it was. Lack of communication! So of course, when I got it, the ice had melted and was watered down. Ugh.\\n\\nIf the kind of service you like is where your glass of water is never empty, this is the place you should go! Water was the only thing I didn't have to ask for.

The place was fairly empty which made me pause, however we decided to go for it.\\n\\nThe ambiance was not exactly Mexican as the furnishings are more contemporary and devoid of latin influence,  than you would find in an authentic Mexican restaurant.  The extreme off-road motorcycling showing on the TV's didn't exactly bring me back to old Mexico either :-)\\n\\nThe chips were warm and yummy, as were the flavors of the two salsas.   However, what I thought was a pepper slice in the tomatillo salsa was actually a red rubber band.  When we pointed it out to our waiter Paul, he quickly apologized and said it must have some off of one of the ingredient bags.   He didn't say anything else and didn't offer  to comp a drink or dessert, which is common practice in the restaurant business.  Not a big deal, but definitely not handled professionally.\\n\\nMy wife did not enjoy her chile relleno as the stuffing has a sweetness with a cinnamon-like taste, and it was overly greasy.   It may be a combination that appeals to other, however didn't go over well with her.\\n\\nI ordered the enchilada mole and again it was middle of the road.  The mole sauce was actually quite tasty, however the tortilla had a crunchiness as a result of sitting under the heat lamp too long, and the chicken was bland and dry.   This explains why  the plate was so hot when it arrived at the table.   I found the mixed vegetables to be tasty and ate them all.\\n\\nThe chef made an appearance at the table to see how everything was, however it was before we had a chance to evaluate the meals and find the rubber band in the salsa.\\n\\nIn general, middle of the road food with poorly executed incident management will not have us returning."},{"name":"Sichuan Gourmet","address":"91 Middlesex Turnpike","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Really glad we found this place, a hidden gem in a non-descript strip mall - definitely worth seeking out.

When you have an average 30-minute wait, you have an array of seating areas to people watch from after getting a drink from the bar.... Speaking of drinks, $3.50 bloody marys or mimosas, or you can get a \\"jug\\" of wine for $16, which equals about $4 a glass, not bad!  I LOVE the cozy little couches in the outside bar next to the fireplace.  Reminds me of being in a lodge up in the mountains somewhere.  There's also a really great covered patio to enjoy when the weather's good.  \\n\\nAs for food, there are two rooms with four stations of deliciousness to choose from.  I have tried just about everything and it is all good!  Some of my favorites are the migas, mac and cheese, broccoli cheese casserole, home-made corned beef hash, cornflake crusted chicken tenders (try them over the mini biscuits with chipotle cream gravy), cinnamon pinwheels and to top it off (drumroll please) the white chocolate bread pudding with bourbon sauce... YES!!!  And the $16 price tag for brunch is juuuust right. \\n\\nService has always been good, but I should probably go back for dinner or happy hour to have a more rounded opinion of Moonshine.  This is on my list of places to take out-of-towners, as well as guys who want a \\"meat & potatoes\\" kinda dinner other than a steakhouse.  5-stars for great brunch, so let's hope I don't have to deduct for future non-brunch visits.\\n\\nI almost forgot this VERY IMPORTANT WARNING: When you park on 3rd street near Palm Park, make sure to hide all valuables.... and I mean everything!  Or better yet, DON'T park on 3rd Street between Red River & I-35, go somewhere else or valet your car.  After a beautiful afternoon with great food and friends, yesterday I returned to find my car broken into.  They smashed in the window in broad daylight, but luckily they only got away with my iPod (but that's devastating enough).  But what caught my attention is if you look closely, there is broken glass ALL over the ground, like this is a regular occurrence (of course I noticed this while waiting for the police to show up and make a report, not when I unsuspectingly parked there) And when I posted it on FB, I have a friend who has said that two of his other friends have had their cars broken into while eating at Moonshine...

The hubs and I were driving through Portland, on our way back from an exhausting day snowboarding Mt. Hood, and knew that Portland would be the place to satisfy each of our, differing, desires. He for pizza, and I for ramen. \\n\\nIn fact, I sat through an agonizing hour at Ken's Artisan Pizza, basking in the wafts of perfectly cooked crust, sauce, fresh basil, and a little bowl of nibbly sausage. And the only thing that held me through that hour was the dream of ramen. \\n\\nAlas... Hapa PDX did not happen. When we arrived at the little town of food trucks, bright lights aglitter and sounds of cheer ringing from every corner, we found the impossible (or, I suppose, improbable) had happened... Hapa PDX was out of ramen. How does this happen, you ask? Apparently, Valentine's Day is not only a day for the amorous, but also a day for the ravenous. \\n\\nSeeing the tears barely dammed in my eyes, the chef of Hapa PDX recommended Shigezo Izakaya. \\"It's not Hapa PDX, but it'll be the next best thing\\" he said. The hubs sped along, sensing the impending end of the world if I didn't get my ramen. \\n\\nAnd thankfully... I did. \\n\\nI got my ramen, sitting legs stretched out on a mat, watching bamboo making their slow and sly moves in the whispers of the heated air.

The lighting is dim and the decor is warm. We very comfortably sat in the bar area and sipped some cocktails while we waited for our pager to go off.

The wine was crisp and cool, which was a good compliment to the late October heat that was still persistent. The waiter never failed us and kept up with the suggestions. We sampled the homemade potato chips with the spicy scallion dip. (We later decided that this dip was good on anything!) We also shared some of the macaroni which was super cheesy and delish! For the main course I had to get the Texas flat iron steak - after all I was in TX - the land of cattle! The steak was perfectly cooked and was so amazingly wonderful in the port wine sauce! Yumm! The waiter came through again with a suggestion of a glass of Chupacabra Merkin Vineyards Paso Robles to go with - I had another, and then another! Delish! (I know you are thinking how could you eat/drink anything else?) Well we did! We sampled the red velvet cake, which came out and was at least 1 foot tall if you stood it upright, and the apple pie with maple ice cream, which was an ENTIRE pie!

However, our friend wanted the chicken and gyro wrap  and he also got falafel instead of gyro in the wrap which he did not want. When he ordered he even ordered by the number with no modifications so this is kind of  a weird miscommunication. \\n\\nThe falafel is not very good. The outside is very thick and there is not much moisture. I am not really sure why they choose to serve baklava since it seems like they just pick it up from somewhere and stick it in the fridge all day.

Hell, if I hated it you'd see biggo' 1 star glaring at you from the top of my review. But no - I give them 3 stars, because they do deserve three stars.\\n\\nThis review is for brunch, so take that into account as well.\\n\\nEating here for brunch awakens a primitive side that I'd really like to imagine I'd evolved past. I found myself becoming territorial and extremely proximity conscious in the confines of the place. First off would be my initial impression on arrival. Almost half an hour before the doors opened there was already a hefty crew of people waiting outside. This is normal, I was told, due to the popularity of the brunch here. So I took it in stride. Our friends had added our names to the list and so we patiently waited until the doors were opened.\\n\\nAnd here's where the shizz got a bit more annoying for me.\\n\\nPeople who'd arrived twenty to thirty minutes after us bum rushed the doors as soon as they'd opened, vying for a spot, despite most of them not even having their name on the list. The pager in our hands sat silent as we saw these same people seating themselves inside. Only after we approached the hostess did they realize people holding pagers weren't being seated (or so it seemed) and we were guided to a spot. Disorder is a massive pet peeve of mine - and people who insinuate themselves ahead of people who did their fair waiting annoy me ten fold more than that. I'm talking to you, Douchebag line cutter. Or rather, attempted line cutter.\\n\\nI will say in all honesty the food is good, and the staff are great. The problem - and what loses them a star in my book - is not having a clear course for patrons to follow within the buffet of delights. This caused Texas dragon ladies to step in front of you in line frequently, either on purpose or otherwise, oblivious to the annoyance they caused. I know what you're thinking - why not go ghetto and call the hags out? Well, I did at one point - politely - and the crone looked at me like I was attempting to steal her food out of her hands. \\n\\nPeople swarmed the buffet as soon as they were seated, and since at least two of the stations were located in the entryway/lobby, this tangled frequently with the other patrons waiting to be seated. The feeling the area emanated was \\"CHAOS!\\". To be fair, I don't like crowds to begin with...but disordered crowds are what they call a \\"Mob\\" in modern parlance. The way many people acted you would have thought we were in the soup line in Soviet Russia and they just made last call before their number was up to get a bowl.\\n\\nI'd like to go back at some point...but I think when I do I'll be wearing riot gear."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My family and I made a trip to Portland and decided to stop here for lunch.

They even have a whole section of the menu just for lobster dishes. \\n\\nOur college kids shared the Brown Butter Roasted Lobster and the Lobster Roe Noodles both of which were terrific. The Lobster Roe Noodles comes with grilled lobster, a braised short rib, pecorino cheese and chanterelle mushrooms on top of the noodles made with lobster roe. Our daughter who 'does not eat meat' order this and our son had to fight his way in to get his share! The noodles were distinctive and delicious and the rest was equally good. \\n\\nMy wife had the Florida Red Snapper (which I wouldn't have ordered - we're from and in Massachusetts for goodness sake!) but I have to admit, it was the favorite dish of the table (other than the sliders!). The perfectly cooked Snapper was served with nectarines and an excellent citrus vinaigrette. \\n\\nI had the Pan Seared Skate Wing - yes it's an odd dish but I've had some terrific Skate wing in the past (if you are into Skate Wing, try Number 9 Park or Radius - both do it to perfection). While the Quinoa it came with was terrific, the Skate itself seemed odd in texture though very fresh. \\n\\nThe service at ICO was great as well. It was the first night for our server so one of the more senior staff, Josh, kept an eye and ear out to make sure we were well taken care of. \\n\\nNote to ICO Bar - make sure Josh is well taken care of, he's a true professional! \\n\\nBoth servers were extremely helpful and especially knowledgeable about both the menu and the wine/drink offerings. I like to try different wines when we go out and they offer a few that we don't normally see, including a white from Santorini (Greece). \\n\\nOur son ordered a Snug Harbor Smash cocktail which is a delicious combination of 4 rums, lime and some other stuff that surprisingly wasn't overwhelmingly alcohol tasting - it was just tasty! One could get hooked on those! \\n\\nOh and did I mention the oysters? Of course we started with a dozen;  1/2 of the Duxbury variety (of course) and for contrast,  1/2 of the Kumamoto from Puget Sound. The Duxbury namesake oysters are larger and a bit brinier while the Kumamoto are smaller and more subtle.

My hubby went for his fave, the Caesar salad. My risotto was good. It was a little heavy for a starter and I wished I had ordered the ceviche of the day instead. That was my bad ordering. My husbands salad was great. I loved the citrus taste in the dressing. \\nNext, we went for the popular porterhouse for 2 - medium rare (as it should be). It was perfect and the presentation was a bonus. The bleu cheese butter was a nice addition but the steak is good enough to stand on it's own. We chose 2 sides - mac n cheese and jalapeno cremed corn. I was not wowed by the mac n cheese probably because I make a killer mac n cheese (that my friends call crack n cheese because the love it so much). It was pretty good just not great. Now, the creamed corn was devine. It was the best side dish I have ever had. Period.\\nTo complete our gluttony, we went for the peanut butter cup pie. I don't have a sweet tooth so I can easily pass on dessert but this was a nice finish to our meal. It was enough for 2 (maybe 3) and was not too sweet - which I loved! \\nThe service - \\nOur server and the entire wait staff was attentive, friendly, relaxed. I was quite happy with our service.\\nThe women at the hostess stand were snobby and elitist acting. I wanted to remind them I was the patron and they were the staff and that they may want to acknowledge who was being walked to the table and who was walking us to the table.

I heard every topic of conversation at the table next to us without even trying. I didn't think it was overly loud even though I had heard it was. I could easily hear my husband, our server ...the 2 couples next to us. \\nThe menu - \\nI'm not a wine drinker but I glanced at the menu to see what bubbly they had. The menu was vast and looked interesting. Their top shelf liquor is truly top shelf and quite impressive. They even offered cigars - which impressed my husband. \\nFood...well, I didn't look much beyond the moo options (even though I only have red meat about 4-5 times a year) but it was impressive and options were plentiful.\\nIt was a wonderful dinner.

We started out with some fresh, jumbo shrimp from the raw bar and the bluefin pate. (We didn't get oysters because we overdosed on them at Neptune's earlier.) I had the Lobster Roe Noodles and my girlfriend had the Roasted Maine Chicken. The noodles were so so so GOOD. A must get for sure if you're a fan of lobster or decadent pasta. The Roasted Chicken was surprisingly great as well -- a great blend of salt from the panchetta mixed with the hearty chicken and balanced by the mash. If I gave a review of the restaurant on food alone, it'd be a 4.5-5, easy. But I gave them a 3. Why? Let me tell you.\\n\\nAs a precursor, I feel I should explain,  I'm one of those users that generally are voyeurs rather than contributors, mainly because I love all food and am pretty forgiving when it comes to most experiences. (Sorry to all the other yelpers who put in all the work, and thank you for all your wonderful recommendations!)\\n\\nSo when I am compelled to write a review, it's usually because either the restaurant completely blew me away and exceeded all expectations, or the complete opposite, leaving me more disappointed than an orphan on Christmas Day. \\n\\nWe came to the restaurant at 10pm for our reservation on a Saturday night. We noticed it wasn't actually very busy as we had expected; we did get a pretty late reservation, after all. We got seated promptly, towards the back of the restaurant. \\n\\nOur waitress came and brought us the dinner menu, gave us some water, and said she'd be back shortly to get our order. So far so good. We look at the menu make our decisions in 5 minutes and close our menus and just talk to each other. At this point I'm pretty hungry so I check my phone to see how long it has been. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. More time passes. Finally our waitress is back, and takes our orders. Hmm, maybe she got caught up with other tables or had an emergency somewhere, whatever, fine. We get our food and all is well. I scarf down everything, and my girlfriend has to take home half of her entree per usual (I always want to try everything). Waitress comes and packs it up for us and we ask for the check. And it's like we have deja vu. Our waitress is nowhere to be seen. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. More time passes before my girlfriend decides to walk my card up to a different waiter and say we'd like to pay so we can leave. As she walked back to the table we heard a different waitress say \\"oh shoot I was supposed to watch that table!\\"\\n\\nI was pissed. I realize I might have overreacted writing this now, but damn, if I'm at your restaurant for a 10pm reservation, you better assume I'm pretty hungry. Now if this were prime dinner time and your restaurant was filled to the brim, I would have thought nothing of it. But when only 1 out of 3 tables has patrons, I'd expect a little more timely service. Especially when all I wanted was my check.

What a huge mistake! Yes, it's bigger and better now but the food quality has just simply gone to the trash. First the curries have so little protein in them that by the time you are done eating half of your bread or rice you are just left with the curry.\\n\\nThe onion and tomatoes were definitely not cooked like they should be for a curry. They were not fully browned and a paste was made out of them to form the curry.\\n\\nI always got karahi paneer here and it was big pieces of paneer with some curry that coats the paneer and not the liquid kind but the one this time it was this undercooked watery curry and karahi goat had the exact same curry. Karahi goat had few tiny pieces of goat and that's it!\\n\\nNaam was not naan.it was like a pita bread. I think they have a tandoor now but the naan recipe is definitely off.\\n\\nIt's a shame that Portland is a great food city there isn't even one good Indian/Pakistani restaurant.

We are: 30-something couple, I'm a vegetarian, he is not.\\n\\nI had read great things about Pok Pok and vowed that the next time we were in Portland we should make a point to go.  The moment I got a chance to take a look at the menu, however, I knew I would be in trouble in terms of vegetarian items.  The menu only has about 4 vegetarian items, none with any kind of protein, and specifically says \\"no substitutions\\".  In fact, I'm at a total loss as to why Yelp says \\"vegetarians go nuts for this spot\\" -- not so much.  I asked our waiter and his response was \\"Well, are you a true vegetarian?\\"  Um, yeah.  I'm not one of those people who eats chicken and fish and calls themselves a vegetarian.  All of my choices were essentially salads.  I went with the only one that was warm, the watercress \\"salad\\".  When it arrived I noted the look of shock on my boyfriend's face: a pure look of \\"really\\"?  It was literally just sauteed watercress, garlic and soy sauce -- totally uninspired and, well, sad.  In addition, our waiter had taken our utensils away, so I had to ask for chop sticks -- with this request I got a dirty look because \\"Thai people don't use chop sticks\\".  Well, this is fine and good, but then why would you A) have chop sticks in the first place, and B) have forks on the table when guests sit down only to take them away?  I'm not afraid to use my fingers, but frankly, it wouldn't have worked out so well  (picture eating watery sauteed spinach with your hands).   And why charge extra for rice, especially with a dish like that?\\n\\nI get that Pok Pok is supposed to be an \\"authentic\\" Thai experience, and I'm certainly not looking for some crappy \\"American\\" Thai food.  I also understand the concept of family style dining (which doesn't work so well in a party of 2 if you want different things).  But MANY Thai are vegetarian.  In fact, there is a huge vegetarian festival in Thailand every year.  It seems bizarre to not only leave out this significant population of the community that you serve, but also the community you are trying to represent.  \\n\\nThe only reason why I gave 2 stars instead of one was because my boyfriend, who ordered the signature wings, had a good experience."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very good value for the price.

It is clear that they truly care about their customers with their service and gestures. They give complimentary popcorn + jalape√±o cornbread for every table which I think is great. The food overall is given in large portions so the high price is pretty justified. Oh AND they're dog friendly on the patio!! \\n\\nOne thing I found as a con is that this place is NOT vegetarian/vegan friendly. They only have one entree that is mainly vegetables and mostly every other dish has meat in it."},{"name":"Pizzeria Rico","address":"32 Bromfield St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Hard to say why I've never made it to Pizzeria Rico during my two year stead working in their neighborhood.

Pizzeria Rico is much bigger inside than I'd expected, with plenty of seating. Although there was no lack for customers when I went, the restaurant seemed quiet, which is always a welcome respite from places where you have to yell to be heard.\\n\\nNo fancy convoluted culinary tomfoolery to wade through here--their menu is direct and refreshing. If you've ever had a nonna (Italian for grandmother) in your life, the food here may well remind you of plates you ate in her kitchen. It certainly did for me. The spaghetti marinara was the perfect comfort food on a cold day, and the all-beef meatballs were beyond delicious. Perfect homestyle meal on a snowy Friday like this one.\\n\\nRecap: I was feeling really angry about the influence of hegemonic eating norms on my life, and then I ate some spaghetti and meatballs and felt a lot of better."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had a great time at Pho Basil last Friday night.

Got everyone together and ventured over through the wind tunnel streets around Mass Ave that define a Boston winter (fall?). Pho Basil was warm - both light and temperature wise. They easily and comfortably accommodated our party of 5 immediately and all subsequent requests through out the night (water, extra napkins, menu substitutions, chopsticks, etc.) The bottle of Pinot Grigio ($26) that I split with the three girls was light and refreshing. My Chicken Pad Thai without egg was the hit of my evening though. SO good (I'm craving it right now) and I think it was even better when I had it for breakfast and lunch the next day.

My family and I were staying at the Holiday Inn across the street before my dad's heart surgery. There is really nothing around, and the location is very unassuming.

I'll be damned if they weren't the best tortilla chips I've ever had. Crispy but \\nlight.... Idk you'll have to taste them to know what I mean. The salsa was rather spicy, and they didn't have a less spicy option. I just dipped my chip and tapped off the excess. The chips were so good, I needed it!!! \\n\\nMy mom and I ordered margaritas. We weren't sure if we should get the cucumber margarita, or the house Marg with cucumber puree - they said there was a difference! If you like it a little sweeter, be sure to get the house marg with cucumber puree - so DELICIOUS!!! And refreshing!!! Ohhh, but they say they're 14 oz... They're DEFINITELY not.

The name of the restaurant is a little missleading, since the menu seems to focus more on ramen. But to those who say there aren't enough ramen choices, I think that's silly anyway. Ramen traditionally would be one broth with different toppings, so you don't actually need separate menu items if you can change the toppings.\\n\\nAnyway, this time we got gyuudon, nigiri sampler, tiger maki, and sweetheart maki. No ramen, sorry.\\n\\nThe sushi is Americanized, as you can tell from the list of fancy maki. But honestly all the maki I've had has been creative and delicious as heck, so no complaints here.\\n\\nWe're pretty big sushi snobs, and the nigiri was definitely a solid 4 stars for Boston in our opinion. Fish was fresh and good looking with a nice flavor. They even put a dash of wasabi under the fish, so more points back to being \\"authentic.\\" \\n\\nService was friendly, the interior is nice and they have many delicious photos on the walls to get you ready for dinner.
