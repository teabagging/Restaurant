I've been there with the line out the door - never takes more than 20/25 minutes to have food in your hands. WAY faster than any restaurant when you show up and there is a line!\\n\\nThat being said - the breakfast line is half the fun.  I try to understand how one could hate it - mainly the Massholes out there who are so scared to touch anyone, be close to people they don't know, or in general expect the waitstaff to be their bitch.  Personally, I find the environment kinda fun.  You always get to meet someone from far away while you're in line, random strangers ask each other \\"what's good here,\\" and the dance that everyone has to do to reshuffle when the bus cart comes back is one-of-a-kind.  I like to go here on dates to suss up how uptight someone is.\\n\\nBeyond that - yes the food could be a little cheaper.  The omelets seem kinda small, but always fill you up. There is always a seat once you get your food, and the clean-up crew is more than happy to grab you a coffee refill or bring the cream to you - even though it is not their job.  They definitely deserve to be treated better!

We only went to the bar for a couple drinks and appetizers. But the night started out heading into the entrance where they ask you for a picture ID to enter.

He looked at us like idiots, and I said, \\"oh just one for all 3.\\" \\"Thats what I said,\\" he replied in a snearing 'you're an idiot' tone. I'm a restaurant manager myself, and I know he has nothing to do with the restaurant- but please, all you have to say is \\" yep.\\" this just started me off feeling stupid, and like a dumb tourist (no offense, we're all tourists at some point)- when really I work in the city in a restaurant. I wanted to snap back at him but didn't. \\n\\nAnyways back to the actual restaurant. \\nWe got seats at the bar, and it took about 10 minutes to actually be greeted by a bartender- tuesday night- not that busy. We looked at the drink menu and- and I must say that the wine by the glass list is pretty horrible. Shoofly Shiraz? Louis Martini..? really, I guess I'm just a wine snob, but at a place like Top of the Hub I would expect something a little more than something I can get at a \\"hodunk\\" liquor store for $12. \\n\\nOn the bright side the bartenders were extremely nice, and the view was pretty awesome, and I did love the live jazz music, as did my friends.

Don't plan on staying more than an hour, however. The restaurant asks that you plan on only one hour so that other customers can also enjoy the food. Parking is a bit of a pain, so allocate plenty of time prior to your appointment to search and find parking on the street. \\n\\nThis restaurant is located in charming area, and the ambience is just right considering its specialty and crowd. The restaurant has character, the stools are made from wine barrels and there's a touch of vintage feel. If you look around, you'll find a stained glass window. \\n\\nThe food itself were delicious. The chef takes a creative spin with the pizza, but s/he does not settle for anything less than high quality ingredients. The mozzarella, spices, arugula, etc. all tasted fresh. My husband and I started with two appetizers since they were having a half-off special deal for appetizers. We ordered roasted green beans and texas burrata. We absolutely loved green beans, the mix of spices and preparation were impeccable. The texas burrata elected different reaction from my husband - he wasn't fond of it, whereas I loved it. \\n\\nMy husband went with fennel sausage pizza. His favorite part was the sausage, its flavoring was amazing. He would highly recommend this to anyone. I had bianca pizza, and I was impressed by the creativity placed in creating this pizza. It had ricotta, mozzarella, and after baking, they piled arugula on top. It tasted creamy, light, and almost lemony with the arugula. It was different from common staples found in restaurants, and I appreciated its unique quality. I would recommend this to adventurous spirited individuals wanting to try something new. \\n\\nWhat I am not fond of was the fact that you'd have to wait a while for the pizza to come. Since there's only one hour allocated to customers, I wanted to get my hands on pizza sooner. I think it took at least half an hour or 45 minutes for our pizzas to come out. We paid approximately $50 for two people, and I admit I was a little sad I couldn't stay long enough to savor every bite.

However, (un)fortunately I didn't feel like waiting in line for ~1 hr the previous day and decided to give Blue Star a try (no wait!). \\n\\nHere are the pros of Voodoo: \\n1. Creative concoctions with fun medleys of different flavors. Great variety of donuts as well\\n2. Fun names! And I'm quite a sucker for fun names\\n3. Overall quality of the donuts are better than the average donut shop with strong and delicious flavors (we ordered a dozen donuts so we can safely judge away!)\\n\\nHere are the cons of Voodoo: \\n1. Although the overall quality of donuts is great, no particular donut had a wowza factor. The texture was meh and not the kind of melt-in-your-mouth-ness that one would anticipate after an hour long wait. I literally cannot remember one particular donut that I loved out of the 12 different donuts that we ordered\\n2. I had tried the Bacon Maple donut at Blue Star the previous day and was left SO disappointed after trying Voodoo's version of that. Voodoo's version was soggier, overly-sweetened and literally had an entire piece of overly salty bacon in the donut. I'm not talking about little chunks of bacon - I'm talking about a massive slab of breakfast-style bacon. It was a bit much and the flavor was completely lacking \\n3. The line. Thankfully, we didn't have to endure the notorious wait because we went at 7pm on Christmas Eve. However, I've heard that the wait can be quite arduous\\n\\nThus, if you're craving some delicious gourmet donuts and are trying to decide between Blue Star and Voodoo, I would highly recommend the former over the latter.

I have a culinary degree and have worked in more than one Michelin-starred restaurant. I'm not a snob when it comes to food, though -- I love a good plate of enchiladas or a burger as much as anyone -- but I expect competence and quality execution when I spend money eating out, particularly when I visit a place with as many great reviews as Launderette.\\n\\nFirst, it's a really cute restaurant. Light, airy and inviting. Great vibe all the way around. \\nMy dining companion and I sat at the bar and started off with a sparkling ros√© cremant d'Alsace, which was lovely and perfectly chilled. Glasses also were chilled, which was a nice touch in this climate. \\n\\nWe started off with the crudo, which was striped bass on this night. Presentation was nice, though I noted the fish was sitting in a pool of the accompanying sauce. Kind of unusual for a crudo, which typically highlights the lovely freshness of the fish, but we dug in without question. The chili-infused emulsion was incredibly overpowering to the point that we couldn't even taste the fish. So we scraped a bit off and tried the fish as naked as we could get it. Not fresh at all. I'd guess it was at least a day old based on the texture and strong flavor. This was on a Saturday night, so absolutely no excuse for not having fish delivered that day.\\n\\nNext came the tandoori prawns and blackened okra. Lovely presentation on both.\\nAgain, though, the sauce on the prawns was totally overpowering. One prawn was still gray and mushy -- totally undercooked -- and two were charred to the point of being rubber. One was just right. Not sure how fresh they were as it was completely impossible to taste them, much less the fresh herbs, under all the sauces.\\nThe okra was nicely cooked but once again, the amount of seasoning used made it impossible to taste the okra itself. \\n\\nBy this point we were both guzzling water because of the overwhelming amount of sodium in all the sauces and seasonings. Still, we were hopeful for the third course, the charred octopus and the kombucha squash. \\nNot only was the octopus not properly trimmed of the mushy, fatty outer layer, it was marinated in what appeared to be some kind of red-wine-vinegar base that just left it tasting pickled. Finally, it was so tough we could barely chew it. And, once again, so much sauce. We both had one bite and couldn't take another. \\nThe kombucha had a nice flavor and presentation, but was drowning in it's buttery swimming pool, making it turn to mush within minutes. \\n\\nOverall, I think this is a kitchen with some really great flavor profiles, but they're simply too heavy handed with the execution. The crudo, for example, could've been lovely with fresher fish and just a drizzle of the chili emulsion. \\n\\nI'm honestly not sure I'll return as there are other restaurants in Austin that serve better food, but it is a really cute setting."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Failed to meet the hype.

For someone who would love nothing more than to be inadvertently locked in a library overnight, the prospect of staying in a renovated school has enormous appeal.  (Not all of the properties are re-purposed schools, and one of them, notably, was once a poor farm.) Should these people ever acquire and rehabilitate an actual library, I must fear for my vacation budget.  \\n\\nWe began our stay by wandering the corridors in search of the front desk.  While the way to it is adequately signed, the corridors are many, and long, and the art on their walls is plentiful and pleasantly distracting.  Check in was simple and gracious, and we proceeded to our room.\\n\\nThe room, Mr. Toad's Room, is lovely.  The ceilings are high, and a wall of  tall windows lets in whatever sunlight Portland will offer up in a day.  (In August, this is quite a lot.) There are bushes planted outside the windows, which lend a natural privacy, even if the draperies are left open.  There are two security doors between the outside hall (which is open to the public) and the room.\\n\\nThe furnishings are solid wood, antique, and nicely made.  There is of course a desk, from which I write you now.  The bedside lamps have fringed shades, which shall forever charm.  Rather than the chest of drawers one customarily finds in a hotel room, the old classroom closet is pressed into service, with its long shelves, row of hooks, and a closet rod with hangers.\\n\\nA few things are lacking.  I mention them only because you might be the sort of person who is terribly annoyed by them, and if so, you might prefer accommodations elsewhere, so as to avoid becoming overly perturbed.\\n\\nNotably, there is no television.  There is complimentary wireless internet access throughout the building, so you could certainly access video programming through your mobile computer or phone instead.  There is, additionally, a movie theatre upon the premises, and it is outfitted with row upon row of large, comfortable couches.  Admission is free for hotel guests, and most incredibly, they serve intoxicating beverages, along with pizza and popcorn.\\n\\nThree are not many electrical outlets to be found in the room, so if you are heavily dependent on them to charge your electronic devices, it might be wise to bring an inexpensive power strip with you.  \\n\\nThe sheets are thin.  This does not trouble me, as it is rather like staying in your grandmother's guest room, where the sheets are well-used, clean and soft.  But some cannot sleep on anything but luxury linens, or so I am led to believe.\\n\\nPerhaps the oddest lack is that there is no means to prepare coffee in one's room.  This can only be related to the fact that a large full-service restaurant and five bars operate within the Kennedy School's walls.  There is complimentary coffee at the front desk, but if you don't note its presence when you check in, you shall find yourself at a loss later on.  If you cannot face the world without a caffeinated beverage first thing in the morning, you should be prepared.  \\n\\nIn addition to the movie theatre, there is also a soaking pool, lushly landscaped, and filled with salt water heated to a comfortable 100 degrees.  For further diversion, the nearby Alberta Arts District is awash with restaurants, galleries, and small shops.  Had we not been travelling with a minor, we may have enjoyed the on-site bars, but we shall have to visit these another time.\\n\\nIn short, the Kennedy School may be more than you expect, or perhaps less. If it is the sort of thing you like, you are likely to like it a lot."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food great service.

I went there for their lunch specials, which are currently priced at $12 and are accompanied by a spring roll and a side salad. I've had their Pad Cashew Nut and Mus-A-Mun Curry. While the spring rolls are quite tasty, I found the rest of the food to be just okay, nothing to really write home about. The service was also a bit of a mixed bag: the staff are certainly quite friendly and attentive, but the wait time for your food can be quite wrong. The first time that I visited, I waited 15-20 minutes for my food, which is fairly reasonable. However, there was a table beside me that ordered before I had arrived but did not receive their food until about 10 minutes after I had received mine, meaning that they probably waited 30 minutes for their food. Overall, I can't say that I'd personally recommend this restaurant, but I won't discourage anyone from checking it out either.\\n\\nPad Cashew Nut (Chicken, $11.95)\\n2.5/5\\nThis was served with rice, a spring roll, and a side salad. The spring roll was fantastic: piping hot, crispy and filled with savoury vermicilli noodles and vegetables. The salad was dressed in a sweet vinegarette, and had a slightly peppery flavour that I personally didn't like; I did however, enjoy the slices of strawberries. The rice was on the firmer side, which I actually liked. I didn't really care cashew chicken itself however. Although it's supposed to be stir-fried, it was quite watery and had no hint of caramelization. There was a decent amount of chicken; they used white meat (which is inferior to dark in my opinion) and it was reasonably tender. Although the flavour was okay, it was really nothing special and not at all memorable.\\n\\nGaeng Mus-A-Mun (Beef, $11.95):\\n3/5\\nThe spring roll this time came out within about 2 minutes after I had ordered. One bite into it and I knew the reason why it came out so quickly: it had apparently been sitting out for a while and was just lukewarm. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty, just not as good as the one that I had the day before. The salad this time contained a few slices of apple in addition to the strawberries, which I appreciated. The curry contained some potato, onion, tomatoes and beef (my choice of protein). The sauce itself was actually quite tasty: creamy, sweet with a fantastic fragrance from the coconut. Unfortunately I was less than impressed by the meat. The portion was, first of all, a bit stingy. More importantly however, the beef was a bit dry and tough, and did not have much flavour. The potatoes were also quite underseasoned.

Personally, I would just go with the plain o' beef because you get a lot of meat and that ish is tender!

Some places you have to sit there and pick away at the lard which can get quite annoying. Not here!\\n\\nWe also got the spicy tendon and beef noodle to share. Same deal as the beef noodle soup but you get a boat load of tendon. I'm not big on that so that's why I say just get beef only but if you love that stuff, fire away.\\n\\nThe locals we ate with (who picked the restaurant) said the soup base was a little off that day. I threw in some extra chili because it wasn't spicy to begin with, plenty of vinegar, and some of that spicy radish we picked up at the counter by the cashier. Mixing in all that definitely made the soup more rich & tasty. The cold pickled cucumber side dish was also a great compliment to our noodles. Walk up to that counter and check out some of the side dishes they have to offer, those are self served.\\n\\nThe steamed dumplings were sub par, they can easily be passed on.\\n\\nWhether or not the soup base on this day was off or not, I still say it was an enjoyable lunch. The \\"homemade\\" noodles were cooked long enough to become soft just like the meat. It was a simple and affordable meal (maybe $10ish/person). The restaurant can be somewhat hidden because it's in an awkward corner of a plaza surrounded by a bunch of other restaurants and shops on the first floor. The addy says Kingsway but it's really facing Neslon street.

You could see all of the history of this place and it honestly doesn't look like they changed much since they first opened their doors. To start off, they bring you a slice of complimentary cornbread. This was some of the best cornbread I've ever had. Unfortunately, after that the meal took a quick turn in a bad direction. I wasn't super hungry so I just ordered their clam chowder. It was a nice thick chowder, but the flavor was almost nonexistent. There were not any herbs or flavorful seasonings. It honestly just tasted like cream with clams in it. I was expecting a lot more more flavor, but did not get it. However, my wife really enjoyed their mussels. I'm sure if I tried something else it would have been pretty good, but the clam chowder was a let down. I would still recommend checking this place out if you have time. Thankfully our wait was only about 15 minutes, but I'm sure it can be much more then that at certain times.

Good sign.\\n\\nBut then that's where all the magic stopped.\\n\\nA waitress (#1) came by to take our name down and said it would be about 10 minutes.  We said okay and waited.  10 minutes turned in 20 but that was oky as we understood it was busy.  A family of 3 who was sitting by the window bar area was leaving and the waitress (#1) asked if we would be okay to sit there.   I didn't really want to but my boys were hungry so we said sure.

I was a little irked when the waitress (#1) just reused the soy dishes that family had left there unused for our setting when she was getting the table ready.  Even if they seemed unused...isn't it common sense for any establishment to ensure health and sanitary standards to change settings if the table was seated previously?  Again, I might be a bit picky since I am OCD about these kinda things but how hard is it to just change it?   Anyways, I asked her if she would change them for me and she looked at me as if I had shot her cat or something.  I don't think my request was OUT OF THIS WORLD but simply for my own personal ease of mind.  \\n\\nAnyhow, she sat us down, walked off and another waitress (#2) came by to give us some tea and said to me that she will seat us at a real table (behind us) as the patrons were leaving real soon.  We thanked her and said okay.    We took this time to look over the menu and decide what we were going to get.  \\n\\nWe notice the table behind us had cleared out (it's been about 5 minutes or so) and the table was set.  Waitress #1 was outside cleaning a table and I asked her if we could move over now that it is free.  She gives me this look and says \\"it's reserved.\\"  \\n\\nExcuse me?  \\n\\nBy this time I was already super annoyed because I was hungry and a little put off by how she made me feel like an idiot about the soy dishes.  I said to her that we were told we could sit there and she replies back with \\"..no sorry.  It's reserved.  We can't let you sit there.\\"  And as she is finishing off her sentence, waitress #2 walks over and says \\"Okay, the table is ready for you!\\"  I am confused as eff right about now and tell W2 that we were just told we can't sit there because there's a reservation.  I look at W1 and I can just tell she is caught in a lie.  They start talking in Korean and Waitress #2 just stops and says to me \\"There is no reservation, I will seat you guys there.\\"  \\n\\nSo we get seated, and I can tell the waitress (#1) is embarassed as she avoids me the rest of the night.

I'd heard it has a great atmosphere and out of all the restaurants I looked at for Valentine's Day, their menu really caught my eye. Unfortunately it didn't live up to its reputation.\\n\\nOur reservation was for 8:30 Sunday night but our table wasn't ready for about 10-15 minutes. We ended up getting seated in a back room and on the plus side it was a bit quieter, but I felt like we were just being shoved out of the way and placed in a corner. We noticed a booth opened up and I think it was even before we received our drinks. We asked if we could switch tables and were told no, but we didn't see anyone else sitting at the booth the rest of the night.\\n\\nService started off very awkwardly with two different people asking our water selection and then two other people both asking to take our drink orders. There was no coordination among the employees. Then as the night progressed service got slower and slower to the point it felt like they forgot about us all the way in the back. \\n\\nThe drinks were the best part of the meal. I ordered the Ginger and Spice because it had my two favorite alcohols: whiskey and St. Germaine. Thankfully I was not disappointed and also pleasantly surprised that the drink was much stronger than it tasted.\\n\\nFor Valentine's Day they offered both a la carte selections and a three course prix fix option for $55. I went a la carte with flatbread to start and then a pumpkin risotto with braised lamb. My boyfriend got the three course menu with a crab cake, surf and turf, and chocolate cake.\\n\\nProbably no one will get this reference because it's from a podcast, but when the appetizers came out, my first reaction was: awww, it's a sad little crab cake. The stark difference in my plate-sized flatbread compared to the tiny crab cake sitting in a pool of creamed corn was comical. I really wanted to like both the flatbread and my  entree because all the ingredients are things I love but they just didn't come together that well. Everything was okay but for a special meal I wanted it to be at least great if not amazing. My boyfriend's meal was just okay as well. We thought that creamed corn was a strange accompaniment for the crab cake - a fresh corn salsa would have been better. The steak was nothing special and the lobster was slightly overcooked.\\n\\nAs we were dining, we saw slices of chocolate cake being delivered to the tables around us. It looked really good and I hoped that the meal would at least end on a high point. But they must have run out of the Valentine's Day cake because what we received for dessert was a sad alternative. It was like a mini single serving cake cut in half with a whipped cream center and a few fresh strawberries. The cake was super dry. We received no explanation and no option to switch to a different dessert.\\n\\nOverall I was disappointed with my experience at Hamilton's Kitchen and don't plan to return. It's still a very nice atmosphere - at least in the lounge and main dining room - but the food just wasn't up to par.

The hostess then came up to us again at about 9 and said they didn't have a regular table for us but if we wanted, they could set up a table with a couch in the lounge.  At that point, I was very frustrated.  That wasn't how I wanted to eat my dinner but I was starving.  The bartender then offered us bar seats and we just took them.  Very disappointing since it was our anniversary.  \\n\\nWe started with wedge salads.  Okay, nothing really amazing.  My husband had the t-bone and I had the filet.  Both were very good and cooked as ordered.  The sides were so basic, I could have easily made them myself.  We had the fries, the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach.  The sides at both L'Andana and The Capital Grille are both better.  We finished with creme brulee.  Okay, but again, nothing outstanding.\\n\\nMy takeaway is that this is a high end steakhouse 15 miles from Boston.  There are better places in Burlington and there are much better places in town.  For a price point of well over $300 with drinks and tip, I think they need to step up their game.

I went for Portland Dining Month, which I know is not always the best time to go to determine the wonderfulness of a restaurant, but this was, well as I said...disappointing. The menu itself looked impressive, a nice selection. The execution? A different story. \\nI stared with the wilted spinach salad which I will say, was amazing. The salad is what gave this place 2 stars instead of 1. I really enjoyed the smokey, salty, baconey, dressing. Yum. \\nI enjoyed the salad so much, I was convinced my second course would be amazing, wrong-o. I ordered the chicken with wild rice, the wild rice was not well cooked. I know wild rice, I am very familiar with it, and this wild rice was crunchy, not \\"under-cooked\\", crunchy. The rice was also wildly overdressed, the balsamic was a punch to the face, I am still burping up balsamic flavor 16 hours-later. The chicken was dry dry dry, even though it was stuffed with goat cheese, which helped it some. \\nMy father ordered the steak, which was a beautiful piece of meat, perfectly cooked medium-rare as he ordered, and awfully, terribly, bland. There was no love given to this beautiful piece of beef. It tasted as if it had not been seasoned at all. Such a disappointment. \\nThe final gripe I had with this place is a small one, but was a bug-a-boo for me just the same. The wine glasses were big, which is fine, if you serve a bigger portion of wine, but when you serve the standard wine poor, in a bigger glass, it just looks weird, like your getting ripped off but you know your not. The other issue with the alcohol at this place, is since the drinks come from the Driftwood bar next to Gracie's, they come out slow, super slow. So if you want your drink with your meal, give your self plenty of time and order way ahead. \\nOur server was also really kind. She was a nice young lady, timid, but sweet.

After 30 minutes, the table next to us (which had been empty when we got there) had their food and we were still sitting there with nothing.  I called our server over.  He explained that ebelskivers (one of the items we ordered) take longer.  Okay, fine.  Might want to mention that when people order it.  It still took another ten minutes (that's a total wait time of 40 minutes after ordering!) before our food showed up, but they forgot one of our drinks, and it took calling another server over to get that remedied.  At that point, I would have been fine just to eat, pay and go, but then I observed two women walk in, sit at the bar and get their order of ebelskivers in ten minutes flat!  So, did the server lie to us, or did someone light a fire under the kitchen staff?  We'll never know.

I just never took the time to stop by until I was craving wings one day and was on a budget. \\n\\nSo the history of this wings spot is its been around for years!! Many locals come here for the famous wings! So I happen to stop by one weekend and the place was empty! Got kinda nervous because apparently this spot is apparently the BEST WINGS IN THE OSCEOLA COUNTY AND ORLANDO! \\n\\nIt had a southern sports bar feel kinda homey and warm. Lady in glasses approached me asking if I needed help and I asked for the menu. She then asked was the order for here or to go and I said it was sit down. She warmly said find a seat and I can follow you and discuss the menu. I truly thought that was nice of her and While I was looking for a bench seat I noticed the seats are busted down, Rips and slouching. She sat across me once I found a seat and we discussed the wings options and what is popular.. \\n\\nEnded up ordering Honey Garlic and Medium Buffalo with Curly Fries. She then asked I want ranch or blue cheese on the carrots that comes with the meal. I opted blue cheese. She didn't ask about what I wanted to drink because she saw my Speedway 79 cents slushie lol \\n\\nThe wait was kinda long - I guess thats what happens when they cook as ordered. I was busy instagraming anyways so the wait didn't seem that long in the end. \\n\\nThere is wide screen TVs around perhaps 2 TVs and alot of seating and ceiling fans for this Florida heat!! When you order a 10pc meal you can split flavors! If you order 20 pcs you can split 4 flavors etc.. \\n\\nFood came in disposable plates, trays. In a way I found that kinda ghetto and cheap but its what the food that counts right? I just found it odd for a established wing place they serve the famous wings in literally paper products. \\n\\nThe food .. Wings were good not as crunchy outside but the meat was juicy. Seemed like the wings were brined first. The Honey Garlic was good chunks of fresh grated garlic and sweetness of glazed honey. The Medium Buffalo was regular buffalo sauce and it did not seem to be house made sauce but more bottled. The carrots were hand sliced in sticks with the blue cheese placed in a paper tray covered in saran wrap. Looked like these carrot trays were already premade based on how flimsy the paper tray was served. The curly fries were DELICIOUS! Crispy and the seasonings were awesome! And you get alot for a small order! The blue cheese sauce was kinda bland little bit of blue cheese chunks but not much.\\n\\nThe value / price and of course customer service is 5 stars but the paper products, flimsy chairs is what made it lose a star imo. They can buy baskets to hold food items at ikea or dollar tree to add umph to how they serve their famous wings imo. Reupholstering the chairs can add umph to the restaurant as well. \\n\\nBut I will definitely come back .. been here 2x already for the wings! \\n\\nI tried the \\"famous fried corn\\" based on yelp reviews and was disappointed because all it was - was fried frozen corn on the cob and melted butter and NOT SWEET GLAZE! \\n\\nI want to try the fried mushrooms next time!"},{"name":"Pei Wei","address":"12913 Galleria Cir, Ste 101","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"2","text":"Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone out of two things on a Monday at 5:30 pm!

I also really liked both the name and the amazing flavor of the Arnold Palmer, which may be the best fruity donut I've ever had. It was tarty and sweet and chunky and delicious.

We were both hungry, and since there was no wait we decided to try it out. We were seated at this small table next to a window. It had a nice view of the street--it was around 8pm so the trees were lit with Christmas lights. Next to our table there was a fireplace on the wall which was a cool touch. The ambiance can be described as modern and rustic. That is the end of what was good with our experience.\\n\\nTo start, we ordered drinks. I ordered an iced tea and my boy friend ordered a coke--they only had Mexican coke with no refills, oh well. Anyways, after about 5 minutes our drinks arrived. My iced tea was under steeped, so I had a large glass of watery unflavorful $3 tea--yum...\\n\\nI ordered the braised buffalo, as recommended by our waitress. It was meh. The braised  buffalo was pretty tough, not soft and tender like most braised meats are. It was served with sour cream and butter mashed potatoes, which were good but then again when you add butter and sour cream to potatoes you really can't go wrong. It was also served with butternut squash--a whole three bites worth. When I finished my meal I was still hungry. I joked it was a $25 \\"snack\\".\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the three course special. It started with a butter lettuce salad. It was lettuce with some pistachios thrown on top, and a generic vinaigrette. The entree was confit of chicken. It came with one piece of chicken which was excruciatingly dry. Underneath was bland, overcooked Israeli couscous. The garnish on the plate proved to be very bitter, and left a bitter aftertaste. This dish needed some sort of sauce, aside from the chimichurri, to balance out the dryness of the chicken and give some flavor to the couscous. The last course was a orange rhubarb upside down cake with whipped cream. It was super small, and the cake itself was dry but the whipped cream helped compensate for the dryness. The cake was mediocre at best. My boyfriend, with three courses, also left hungry.\\n\\nWe got to enjoy a $60 (not including tip) unfilling and unsatisfying meal. We will NOT be returning.

My wife and I were a tad disappointed. The food is good, there was nothing we disliked. But it's not quite the transcendent experience we were led to expect. We were already familiar with Peruvian food from a trip there in 2011, and loved it. \\n\\nTo start we shared the grilled octopus. It was quite well cooked, not rubbery in the slightest, but lacking the smoky excitement of the best grilled octopus. The accompanying ahi sauce was very, very tasty though. \\n\\nFor the main course we both got lamb, my wife the braised lamb shank and me the rack of lamb in delicious dark, mole-like sauce. The lamb shank was very tender and rich, but not above average for this cut of meat, which is often mind-blowingly tasty. It was fine. \\n\\nMy rack of lamb, highly recommended by our server, was two double-chops, gorgeously presented. I've never been served double chops before, and now I think I know why. It's really hard to eat. The two bones make it hard to get at the meat between. It was a lot of work, given that the lamb was medium rare and not terribly tender. But to get at most of the meat I had to manhandle that thing, in a not-very-elegant fashion. Again, I have to give a rave review to the sauce. It was delicious, the best part of my meal. The accompanying potato croquette was overcooked, the fried exterior was very hard and tough, impossible to cut without crushing the entire croquette. \\n\\nFor dessert we shared the trio of cremes brulees. By far the tastiest one was the vanilla. It was amazing. The others were just okay. \\n\\nThe major downfall of this meal was service. Everyone was friendly and polite, but it wasn't very professional. Plates kind of flung down on the table, pacing a bit awkward, our glasses of wine only delivered halfway through our main courses. And one of the wines had clearly spilled all over the base of the glass, and they just plonked it down on the table, leaving red rings on the paper tablecloth every place the glass was set down. \\n\\nOur meal of 1 app, 2 mains, 1 dessert, 2 cocktails, 2 wines came to around $160. I don't expect Michelin star quality at that price, but definitely something better than what we got. We did a lot better for a lot less money at Bamboo Sushi the night before."},{"name":"Leaf Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1710 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Leaf sets a bar for vegetarian food that's beautifully presented and flavored.\\n\\nThis place seriously knocks the comfort food/butter/bacon fad on it's behind and proves that a well-executed dish doesn't need to be laden with pork or fried in duck fat to be full of flavor.\\n\\nI took my mom here for a late post-hiking birthday lunch.  The decor is very simple and clean.\\n\\nThey have a nice list of wine that all falls into one of three categories: sustainable, biodynamic, and organic.  I'm not positive of the difference, but I saw some of my favorites on there.\\n\\nWe both went for martinis...not the frou-frou, sugared rim, wide glass that makes you spill on yourself variety, but in a smaller glass and made with one of their in-house infused, locally distilled vodkas.  Mine was saffron infused with prickly pear syrup.  Strong, but refreshing....my favorite kind of drink.\\n\\nFor entrees, my mom ordered the raw pad thai and I went for the Jamaican Jerk Tempeh....this was a seriously perfect dish.  The tempeh was a similar texture to the mound of forbidden/buddha rice and was situated in a pool of sweet and creamy coconut sauce.  There was just the right amount of heat (although I'm not sure of the source) and a bit of tropical salsa to top it all of.\\n\\nThe raw pad thai is more like a salad and an interesting twist on a standard dish.  It was comprised of lots of crunchy veggies (snow peas, jicama, carrots, bean sprouts) and was dressed in a lighter dressing.

The manager at this restaurant was absolutely unprepared and ill equipped to manage this franchise. Now, at the beginning of our time there, it was not a big deal as myself and my group of friends are VERY understanding people when it comes to being busy or something. Working in the food industry for over 8 years and serving as a manager, I understand how especially after a large event (ACL) that it is difficult to get the restaurant back on track the Monday after a very long and busy weekend. The manager advised us that the wait would be possibly long for our food order to come out which was completely okay. We were okay with hanging out and watching the football game in the meantime. Now, where it became an issue was the 2 hour wait after the entire restaurant cleared out, the 5 consultations with the manager trying to sweet talk us into free drinks for waiting forever for an order of wings that was placed and eventually came 2 1/2 hours later that were the wrong order. At one point when I went up to the manager to complain about the 2 hour wait for 20 wings which should not have taken anywhere NEAR that long, he was so busy flirting with his staff that he was not even communicating to the cooks that there was an issue that needed to be resolved immediately. Finally when we received the wrong order of wings, he attempted to still charge us for the initial order and only take off the complimentary drinks that he bribed us. I like to think that I am a reasonable person, but to be handed a check for over $60 where the service was so awful was absurd. In the end, his regional manager convinced him to comp the check, but at that point enough was enough. The overall professionalism of this manager at Hooter's was very disappointing. For claiming that he was making sure that we would be taken care of, he did not do a great job at all with communicating with his staff to make sure that the customer was taken care of. Our waitress on the other hand was very apologetic and was very nice the whole time. We did give her a nice tip since she was not responsible for the crappy service and execution of the way that shift went that night.

Well, they decide to sit us on the main dinning room floor because the back room had customers in it (a 2-top) and they didn't want us to \\"share the space\\" with them.

It's not any more expensive than a pizza delivery place and the pizza quality is 10x better...literally 10x better.

Perfect for people that want to get a quick lunch.\\n\\nIf you're a sub fan or antipasta fan, you're in luck too. The sandwiches are killer. Same with the pizza the ingredients are fresh and taste fresh. The toasted bun is soft but not too soft and they're quite large.  Even the smaller size is a good size, perfect for lunch.\\n\\nThe antipasta is great for all the exact same reasons stated above.\\n\\nOh and I can't forget to mention this place serves beer and wine.

This might be because he was unengaged, looked bored and disgruntled, and just had a bad night or hates his job.\\n\\nGiven the choices in Winter Park, I can get a very good to great steak at Flemings or Mitchell's or any number of other places- plus service that is somewhat pleasant and engaged.

The hazelnut sticky bun was amazing - I'm a sticky bun/cinnamon roll fan and this is up there on my favorite things - the whole toasted hazelnuts on this balances out the sweetness. The turkey sandwich is probably the best turkey sandwich I've ever had. Now, I'm normally not someone who seeks out or loves sandwiches, but I would go back for this again and again. A lot of moist turkey, fresh baked homemade ciabatta, avocado, this smokey-creamy-slightly sweet/salty bacon aioli, and greens made this a true standout.

We shared two entrees at the table - one the lamb shank..... aaaahhhhh and the other the duck two ways... crispy, tender, flavorful. And oh the sides of rice with each dish were also heavenly - rice with garlic, olive oil, and cilantro - so tender and delicious. Who gets excited about rice? We do. Two desserts - the chocolate torte - yum and the special fruit custard (can't remember the name - just get it.) Drinks were expertly crafted as well. Again - a wonderful wonderful experience.

Does talking to the friendly homeless guy selling newspapers to the people in line add to said excitement? Definitely. Do my girlfriends and I get a good laugh at ourselves and feel like complete dummies when we are first scolded for holding the door open, and then scolded again for blocking the door while standing in the exit? Yes, we are Voodoo virgins. Am I totally amused by looking at the crazy decor on the ceiling and walls once inside the surprisingly tiny shop? You bet. Was it stressful trying to decide which flavors I'm going to pick while staring at the craziest doughnuts I've ever seen? A little, especially since there was a long line behind us staring at me with vulture eyes hungry for doughnuts. \\n\\nAnd now the BIG question - did the doughnuts taste out of this world and blow my mind?? Sadly, NO. It was a doughnut, people. Yes, it may have had bacon on it, and it may have been one of the most clever looking doughnuts I have ever seen, but in the end, the doughnuts itself tasted quite ordinary. But the EXPERIENCE, my friends, was certainly memorable and a trip to Voodoo was the quintessential Portland experience! I'm so glad that I visited and can now say that I've been to Voodoo Doughnuts. But for actual great doughnuts, my friend swears that I should go to Pips.

So... I am not someone who usually complains about everything in a restaurant, but... here I go.  (Background on me... self appointed foodie, love to eat out and try different foods and new restaurants)  First let me say the one star is for the great music that is there. The singers and musicians are quite talented and create a great atmosphere.  Additionally I like the decor and general atmosphere, the restaurant is very clean..  I had been to this restaurant last year for a friend's birthday and really enjoyed my meal, the service, and my experience.  This time I went to celebrate the upcoming marriage of my two friends. I was expecting a great experience, but I was shocked and disappointed instead.  First the Bride to be chose the place based on the fact that they had many vegetarian Entree options on the menu online. There were none when we arrived. When she asked about this they said... \\"maybe there are specials.. we'll check\\".  although friendly, we receive the answer of \\"maybe\\" there are specials?  What kind of server in a place appearing of this caliber  and charging these prices doesn't know what the specials are or if they even exist?!  Finally they came out with a paper print out of \\"specials\\".  Anyway.. the 12 of us  use the 4 bottles of sparkling on the table, order two bottles of wine, a few beers, and some cocktails... we get them without problem.  The \\"cheese plate appetizer that should have had two types of cheeses only had one (feta)... no huge deal we didn't complain.. although the feta was just cheap out of supermarket plastic tub style feta.  We order, and then.. we wait for over 30 minutes without drinks waiting for someone to come around.. a waitress looks at the table and looks away without coming by (again.. no contact for 30 minutes.. restaurant was not even half full).. I call to her and ask if all 13 of us can order some drinks (everyone was dry for a while at this point). She is polite and says sure. We order 2 more bottles of wine and some beers for the rest... Dinner comes about 5 minutes later.... one girl who had for health reasons to order soda, had to ask for her soda 3 times, when she gets it, it's diet and she has to send it back... another girl who ordered meat stuffed grape leaves gets veggie grape leaves... they politely change it.  We get the food... The bride says her veggie pumkin kibby is \\"ok\\" and \\"a little dry\\".  Me and my friend got the salmon (the most expensive entree at 25 dollars) it was over cooked, dry, with no particular flavor. The rice pilaf side was cold and flavorless. The side salad was fine.  I asked my friend how her salmon was (we enjoy fish dishes), she also said the fish was dry and didn't really have any taste.  My friend got the steak, he admits he got it medium well, but felt it was more done than he expected and was very dry.... We eat still waiting for our drinks...sooo we are finishing our food when our wine and beers finally come out.  Now we are done with our food and ready to leave and now we have two bottles of wine and full beers to finish...  I am probably missing several other incidences of confusion and errors... basically the entire experience was a comedy of errors and dry tasteless food for expensive prices.. will not return unless I hear that at least the chef changes....

When this place closes down, I am confident that the chef will be able to find another position without any issues. Yes, I said WHEN this place closes and I say that for the following reasons:\\nThis restaurant is fairly new, and with it being so new I would wonder why it was so empty. The decor is very nice and it gives you a very mature, classy, adult feel for the place, but that is where it stops. \\n\\nThe menu is not too complicated. A simple take on Southern American food items that are very delicious. I went with a group of 4. We ordered the peach glazed salmon, the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, and a burger. The food was delicious...up until my husband found hair on the plate underneath his waffle. Meaning that there is no one in the kitchen checking the plates before they place the food on them. Our waitress, Dee was very accommodating and removed it from our bill and he ordered some wings instead. But needless to say the rest of us almost lost our appetites and started checking our food as well.\\n\\nThe main issue I had with this place is that it took well over 30 minutes for someone to even come and greet us, and that is only because we had to ask 3 different people where our waiter was. The place was no where near packed so there was no excuse for that. We were told that our waitress was another woman who had walked past us several times and never even made eye contact. When my husband finally flagged down a manager, she assigned a waitress, Dee, to serve us. We ordered all of our appetizers and food at once, and didn't order any drinks because we constantly had to ask for water so I didn't want to know what the drinks would be like. Once we ordered our food, we didn't have to wait a significantly long time before we were eating. They also didn't have any bags for our to-go items when we were leaving. I think that poor Dee did the best she could considering the circumstances.\\n\\nI will never dine in at this restaurant again. If I did go back it would be to get take out only. I don't think this restaurant is going to last because the service is so bad. They need to get a new EXPERIENCED front house manager to retrain all of the staff and then maybe they will have a fighting chance, because the food and the ambiance speak for themselves.

Like many here has stated the Ramen is \\"meh\\" to \\"OK\\" but not anything to write home about.  I had the Yatai-Ramen once and Cha Cha ramen twice.  The Yatai Ramen was meh as the taste was fairly bland.  It came with the thin noodles which didn't have much flavor or consistency I'd like.  The Cha-Char Ramen has a rich oily broth which was actually pretty tasty. It comes with the thick noodles which killed the dish in my opinion. The thickness of the noodle should be somewhere between their thin and thick noodles.  I also tried the gyoza and fried chicken.  It was pretty good. \\n\\nThe art of making noodles - The noodles should blanched in boiling water for a brief minute and quickly placed in the broth.  Ramen should be served immediately thereafter.  When the noodles sits in the broth too longer it  soaks up the broth and gets mushy.  That's what the consistency of thick noodles tasted like, To add some crunchiness to the soup I order am extra side of bean sprouts to add to the bowl.  Unfortunately, it was marinated in some type of liquid as the bean sprouts were soggier than the noodles.       \\n\\nThey were busy all 3 times I was there and had to wait for a seat.  The service by the wait staff was a little slow all 3 times and it took longer than it should to get my noodles."},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere was ok, the tables are really close together where I was sitting.

For example, the ever popular bacon maple bar.  Judging from a maple bar standpoint, it wasn't something that I can say stood out from the rest.  But the Bacon complimented it well.  And more importantly no one thought of it.  The same could be said about the Cap'n Crunch donut, or the Oreo covered doughnut or any of the plethora of strange mix and match that goes on in the store.\\n\\nBut it's this kind of creative ingenuity that makes Voodoo popular.

Yet I will try...\\n\\nAs you know from the description, it used to be a school. So the room in which I stayed had ridiculously high ceilings and a fascinating shape. If you're old enough to remember old school schools, there's a main door, and then to the left one entrance to the classroom and to the right, another. So you have a door within a door -- which means that even though they had a huge event going on, a rocking restaurant and bar and folks walking all over the place -- the room was still so quiet, which was wonderful.\\n\\nI was in the mirror, mirror room -- and I'm sorry if this sounds wiggy, but that room is super creepy and definitely haunted. It has chalkboards on the walls, and yes, avbig, fat mirror that faces the bed that tempts you to jump up and repeat \\"Candy Man\\" three times like in that scary movie -- but you don't because you know he'll definitely appear and then it's all over. But one creepy thing is that the roll-down doors to the closets are partially open -- and when you look inside, you have the teeny hooks from a children's classroom, as well as closets that curve around -- perfect for the kid from \\"The Grudge\\" to hide in before he comes out, meows loudly and it's all over. (Yes, I've watched too many horror movies!).\\n\\nSo the vibe is wonderfully creepy. Why do I think it was haunted? A few things, aside from the feeling. First, in the middle of the night my clock reset to flashing 12:00. No other electricity went off, it was just the clock. I told my traveling companion and she experienced the same thing. Second, I heard intentional knocking throughout the day and night -- four gentle knocks. Weird thing? It wasn't coming from the door or an adjoining door -- it was from sort of the middle of the room. I went next door to the adjoining room to see if there was something going on there -- the room was empty. I LOVE that stuff, so I got a big kick out of it!\\n\\nOne tip -- there wasn't a television in my room, which I thought was a nice break. But if you're traveling with children and counting on that as a distraction, might want to ask whether some of the rooms have them or bring another distraction.\\n\\nWe were looking forward to checking out the soaking pool -- but the night we got there it was both packed and one of the guests was waiting at the door with a pitcher of beer to bring in. That didn't appeal. But my traveling companion used it the next night, and it was just her and another person and she said it was wonderful.\\n\\nI ordered room service and what I got was good -- a butternut squash soup and a fruit and cheese platter -- but I don't feel like I can judge the restaurant based on that.\\n\\nSo if you want a very interesting, atypical hotel experience, I'd recommend checking this place out.

A small, funky, independently-owned space serving up grass fed burgers at fast food prices. Decent fries, an \\"in the grass\\" option for gluten-free folk, and a fab local beer selection. \\n\\nWhat's not to like? The service, for one. If you go in there and have a seat at the bar, no matter how slow it is, you'll be ignored until you figure out that you have to order at the register. Even though I've figured it out, I think it's kind of stupid, so I have a habit of going in, sitting down, and waiting to be noticed. I've gotten a beer at the bar that way, once or twice. Not food though. Fine that they are trying to establish a system that works when they're busy, but when they're slow, it's feels a bit ridiculous. It's a minor complaint, however - I've otherwise found the staff very friendly. \\n\\nI think both the food and the service are as good as one can expect at that price point. I'm told there are better (far better) grass fed burgers to be had throughout the city, but I don't hold burger joints to such high standards. \\n\\nI'm knocking three stars off my review because I can't stand hypocrisy and I resent the way Grass Fed, the restaurant, is employing the term \\"grass fed\\" to appeal to a food-conscious public when in reality, the owner(s) could care less where your food comes from. I'm not disputing the grass fed origins of the beef they're serving - I don't think they'd get away with serving meat that wasn't grass fed. But if you get take out at Grass Fed, you'll get several packets of none other than Heinz ketchup! Not Heinz organic ketchup, but the ordinary variety with high fructose corn syrup from GMO corn. And then if you inquire on their Facebook page why you got that poison with your order, instead of responding, they will delete your inquiry. And if you ask them on twitter, they'll ignore you.

I eat out all the time, and I don't mind spending money on food, but this dish was not worth it's price tag. The corn in the lobster dish was definitely frozen packaged corn, and the \\"potato\\" (we paid extra for) turned out to be frozen packaged French fries (are you kidding me?).

I have had countless chicken gizzards and skewers in the past, but I have never seen gizzards this big, and am not sure if those are chicken or turkey gizzards; it was way too big for texture and not as crunchy as regular chicken gizzards.

We are accustomed to the taste of pho soup base and we know exactly what we are ordering even before we step through the door.. So what makes this place so different? \\n\\nBroken Rice is a place that stands out from all the other pho restaurants you would see. Even though they have exactly what you'd expect, they will provide you with a different experience. To start, the decor in this restaurant is quite amazing. Heavy wooden chairs, Tahiti style decorations, and a very interesting choice of lighting from their day and night services, you wouldn't feel as though this is a typical pho joint.\\n\\nAs for the food, the first thing you'd probably notice is that prices at a little more expensive then your average place.

In their defense, Yo Sushi does have better sushi than the other Japanese Restaurants around the area, but not enough to justify $15 specialty rolls and $2.50 individual pieces of sushi, despite fairly nice presentation. \\n\\nThere are alternatives around Burnaby for sushi, Yo Sushi would not be my first choice but may worth trying once for yourself."},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is the CLOSEST thing to true Mexican cuisine I have found in this state.

Yes it's an oyster house, but I came here in search of the famed lobster roll. What resulted was quite possibly the best roll I have had in New England. With the option to go warm or traditional lobster salad style, the roll isn't overly complicated with ingredients or dressing. The warm butter is a huge plus but what sets this version from the pack is the rosemary roll. Stroke of genius! \\n\\nAs good as the roll is, the surprise of the meal was the buttermilk biscuit. I have long staked the claim that biscuit is the best form of bread. Islands creeks biscuit took me to the heavens....or maybe i just confused the multiple layers of fluffiness for clouds.

I have eaten many empanadas here in Miami; this place served me the best one I ever ate in my whole entire life. It was soo good. My friend ate the scampi so fast I didn't get to try it but by the way he demolished it I'm sure it was good. When we arrived, I said to my friend \\" I smell BBQ sauce\\".

The service at the bar was fast and the pretty bartender was so nice. The chicken I ordered was smoked so it had a pinkish tint. I'm aware smoked chicken will look like this but a very small part of the breast was a little too pink for me. I must have looked as if I needed help because this very nice man ( I'm assuming the manager) asked me was everything ok. I asked for the chicken to be a little more cooked as it wasnt raw, just too pink for my preference. He told me he wouldn't dare send my half eaten chicken back to the kitchen and that he would get me a new one. Mind you, I had eaten more than half already. When the food came, it was a whole new plate. With mac and cheese and everything!!! OMG! I felt so guilty I told the bartender, you know it was only a small portion it wasnt the whole meal.

And I want the same thing every time I think Milestone's. I have not found many impressive Eggs Benny dishes around Vancouver, so this is right at the top for me! \\n\\nOf all the chain restaurants, I find Milestone's to be the most appetite-friendly, if that makes any sense. I always find something on the menu that I like or would like to try. They keep the menu fresh every season by updating existing dishes or introducing seasonal or new dishes. They will also feature seasonal and special menus throughout the year that are interesting to check out. \\n\\nThe daily food specials are also very attractive, along with the daily drink specials. Monday Girls Night is such a nice touch! If there's one thing girls cannot resist, it is a fun and relaxing girls night. For those who enjoy a weekly date night, Wednesdays are Milestone's Date Nights. I highly recommend sneaking a peek at the website just for fun! \\n\\nBut, the best part about Milestone's??? ...Maybe not the \\"best\\" part, but it's still something I look forward to... The Bellini! The drink itself, you ask? No. The plastic toy that comes with it? YES. I love that the Bellini comes topped with a different tiny plastic toy ornament each time. It's a fun little thing. Put it on your bedside table to remind yourself how much of a Bellini-holic you are!"},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Restaurant is horrible.

Well, mostly for their great beer selection. They bring in small amounts of really exciting beers and seem to change them up often- had an absolutely delicious Scotch Ale (our table finished off the keg). \\nAlso, it's in my neighborhood and I like hanging out there with friends- it has a nice relaxed atmosphere: an upstairs, downstairs, and patio. I prefer the patio rain or shine especially since they sometimes have the music very loud inside, which is fine if you are on a cozy date and close enough to hear each other but annoying if you are tryihg to converse with a table of four.\\nTo avoid the mediocrity of the food, I usually get simple dishes now like the veggies sandwich and yam fries. I had a steak dinner there ONCE and had a lot of trouble chewing (and chewing and chewing) it. That was awhile ago but I haven't felt too adventurous with their menu since- somebody let me know if they've had a great steak there and I will revisit it!\\nI don't care too much about service usually but find the waitstaff a little too hands off and wish they would notice when we're out of beer etc.\\nThis is a decent choice when you want a reasonably priced meal and great beer with your friends in Mnt.

I'm surprised I'm the first to write a review of it, although I'm sure the soul food conissuers among us have been there. This restaurant is located on Cascade, in the same strip as Up the Creek. I enjoyed the Sunday buffet, which is $22 and well worth it. \\n\\nThey put out a SPREAD: fried, baked, sweet & sour chicken, omelettes to order, standard breakfast fare (eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, french toast), catfish, seasoned cocktail and fried shrimp, carved-to-order roast beef, pasta salads, cabbage, collards (with vinagar--my fave!), mac n cheese (not the best ever, but solid), candied yams (delicious enough to be a dessert), salmon, banana pudding, peach cobbler, cheesecake, cookies. Everything was kept hot and plentiful. Of course, some of the filler sides might rotate, but I'm sure the soul food staples and breakfast choices remain from week to week. There was also a prix fixe menu for $13 with omelette/meats/toast, chicken and two, and a few other options. \\n\\nThe decor is simple and tasteful, the restaurant is pretty small  but doesn't feel cramped or crowded at all.

In Swampscott's dim past there must have been someone significant named Lincoln, it certainly doesn't have anything to do with Abe, and its across the street from the water, so no one would mistake it for a landing.  It also gets my vote for the best breakfast east of Lynn.  Particularly the french toast.  I chose mine with apples, cinnamon and whipped cream.  My highly moral wife had whole wheat french toast with fresh blueberries, yoghurt, and granola.  Both were huge portions and delicious.  The bacon was flavorful, the coffee hot and refilled often.  The place is small, with only one chef slaving away in a very hot kitchen.  About the only kvetch I could come up with is the bathroom facilities are pretty primitive.  The unisex loo is through the kitchen, which does give you the opportunity to thank the chef as you are going to use it.  I was tempted to give Lincoln's Landing one star to keep the rest of you away, but I thought that would be unfair.   That must be what Heather S. did in her June 11 review.   I haven't eaten enough items on the menu to determine whether or not this is a five star place for breakfast, but it might be a candidate for an update.

I decided to eat at this place on whim because I was in the mood for some pizza place dishes and hearing all these Yelp reviews about how good it is. \\n\\nThe first dish I ordered via delivery was a Sausage and Pepperoni Calzone with some onion rings. When my delivery arrived I clearly underestimated the size after opening the box. It was huge! Using really rough estimates, it was approximately 38.5 cm long, 20 cm wide, and 3.5 cm thick. The biggest calzone that I have ever eaten! I could only eat 1/3 of the calzone after eating about 90% of all my onion rings. The cheese was amazingly good, the sausage was tasty, and the bread was crisp and chewy. It was VERY greasy, and I resorted to using a knife and a fork in the end. At approximately $9, a sausage and pepperoni calzone is enough for a good dinner and a great amount of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch for one person. \\n\\nI came here again, and decided to get a medium pizza. I ordered the Brick House, which is a pizza with pepperoni, sausage, pepper, onion and mushrooms. The pizza was approximately 30 cm in diameter. After ordering it, and bringing it back to my apartment, I took the first bite, and I was amazed. The crust was so fresh, chewy on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside. The vegetables were crisp, the sauce tasted right, and the pepperoni and sausages were good. At approximately $13 (including tax), a medium pizza is enough for two people but I was able to eat 5/6 of it (I was really hungry and did not eat for eight hours beforehand). The Brick House Pizza clearly beats Papa Ginos' best pizza, The Works in terms of tastiness and freshness. \\n\\nWhile the pizza was great, I think the Calzones are a much better value unless you order the large sized pizzas and have a group of three people.   \\n\\nThe interior is small, there is no public bathroom, and there's only bar stools for sitting. There is a pile of magazines to read while you are waiting if you are into reading about cars or you can watch the small flat screen TV. \\n\\nThis pizza place is a hidden gem in terms of great pizza and calzones in the Boston area and I am mostly likely going to turn to them for pizza, calzones, and their other dishes. Brickhouse Pizza could have a legitimate chance to challenge Viga (if Viga opened on nights and weekends) in terms of the best pizza place I have eaten in the Boston area, and it is now one of my top two pizzerias in the Boston area... for now."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Of course amazing donuts, we went super early in the morning so the line was minimal but was building up as we were leaving.

I had encountered thief tastings at vineyards (a thief is a wine accessory that allows you to take wine directly from the barrel), but never at a restaurant. Taking directly from the barrel allows restaurants to charge less for great wine, and the collection of oak barrels at the entrance added character and charm. Our waiter, one of the true highlights of our dinner experience, recommended an alternative to our initial choice of wine, and his suggestion did not disappoint. We ended up with a deliciously unique, full-bodied red blend. (The thief of wine is delivered to the table in a glass decanter that consists of 5 large glasses) \\n\\nAPPETIZERS: We ordered calamari, bacon and tuna tartare for the table. The tuna tartare was delicious, but the calamari and bacon far exceeded our expectations. The calamari comes with sauce on top, rather than on the side, and the sauce was truly one of the most delicious I've had--so much better than the run-of-the-mill tarter or red sauce. The bacon came in two soft, thick slabs and melted in our mouths. \\n\\nENTREES: My girl friend and I ordered the scallops, and the men ordered the pork chop and brisket with mac and cheese on the side. Each scallop was prepared perfectly, positioned beautifully on a bed of gouda grits. They truly tasted like steak. The brisket was also delicious, but the pork chop may have won the day. It was marinated for hours in an incredibly delicious sauce, and my husband insists it was the most tender pork chop he has ever had. The mac and cheese on the side was to die for, and it disappeared almost immediately. \\n\\nDESSERT: As you can imagine, we were too full for it--but I can only imagine it would have been wonderful.\\n\\nI will return to this restaurant every time my husband and I return to Atlanta! 5 stars!"},{"name":"Equinox Restaurant and Bar","address":"830 N Shaver St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We had a lovely dinner out in the courtyard the other evening. \\nI like it there.....\\nI had the spaetzle ....it was delicious! \\nI've never had a bad meal there...great brunch!\\nOne would think this restaurant was going to feel pretentious, but I don't find it that way at all.

I never reviewed Leaf??  Well, allow me to remedy that.\\n\\nI'll start by saying that there are a few dishes at this place that I'd kill a man for.  Well, maybe.  But I'd consider it, anyway!\\n\\nOff the Happy Hour menu:\\n\\n- the Puerh mushrooms.  Oh My God.  I'm not sure what is in this dish - just looks like mushrooms, soy-like sauce, rice, and seaweed salad - but it has a salty, ocean-like quality, mixed with a delicate and subtle sweetness that has me craving it at totally random times in my life.  In the middle of the night... on airplanes... while I'm eating at another restaurant... it's that good.\\n\\n- the Trio of Tapas. Particularly the cheese and honey drizzle.  I know, cheese and honey, big whoop.  Somehow it's fantastic.  The eggplant salad, now, I KNOW why that's fantastic.  Because they take the freshest eggplants imaginable and lump them together into a perfect little shiny heap of yumminess.  Okay, I guess I don't know, really.\\n\\n- the Seitan skewers.  This will fool almost any meat-eater.  The sauce is so spicy and fruity that your mouth just does not care whether the stuff covered with it is beef or wheat gluten.\\n\\nActually, most of the stuff I'd kill a man for is on the happy hour menu.  Maybe that's why I always come during happy hour.\\n\\nThe dinner menu is more hit or miss, but most of the stuff on it is good (and I've actually tried more than half the stuff on it).  The pluses:\\n\\n+BBQ Seitan, for the same reasons as the skewers\\n+Polenta Napoleon, because of the way the polenta, mushrooms, and pearl onions feel in your mouth together before they explode into flavor\\n+Roasted Vegetable Lasagne, because it's made a lasagne hater into a lasagne lover with its surprise caches of rich cheese and piles of vegetables\\n\\nNothing else is quite as good as these things.  The one awful dish I had has apparently been removed from the menu.  It was an undercooked, hard-as-rock eggplant dish, which I had replaced with the lasagna.  The reason I'm mentioning it even though it's gone is because they were sort of snooty about replacing it, and when they brought me my replacement lasagna, it was the lunch portion size.  And they charged me the eggplant price anyway.\\n\\nHowever, apart from that and this bizarre happy hour appetizer that's supposed to be a mushroom cake or something, and it's served with vegetarian caviar (??) and boring cheeses, I'm always at least happy with the meals I order.  My favorite thing about Leaf is that it doesn't just make normal meat dishes and then substitute tofu for the meat like a lot of vegetarian restaurants do.  They think hard about the actual tastes of the vegetarian ingredients when they're combining flavors, and the result is a world of difference away from just throwing a tofu patty into an otherwise normal hamburger."},{"name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"3 Monroe Pkwy, Ste E","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"Such a bad experience - I'm by far one of those people that usually just takes it.\\n\\nOrdered online - a bit annoying that you can't mix and match easily but you can add things to the comments section.

I was watching them make it and figured it was not mine due to the ingredients. The guy in charge of everything beyond the meat/cheese called me over and gave me the bag. I said, \\"I don't think you made those right\\". I said they had X number of ingredients removed, I ordered online. He looked at the receipt which had minus marks next to things and said \\"oh I messed that up\\". Pretty hard to confuse a minus mark with a plus.\\n\\nThey started making a new one, once the meat was down they handed it over to said guy. He was confused and asked me what I wanted on them. I said it's all on the receipt. He put on lettuce and looked at me confused. I then led him through what I wanted on the sandwiches even though it was clearly printed on the online receipt. At that point I noticed that no bacon was on them, even though it was on the \\"default\\" club sub - one had been wrapped already and I didn't correct that one, for the one he almost completed he was like \\"oh ya\\" and put it on. On his behave it was the guy manning the meat/cheese cutters that probably should have put that on? He was obviously new and was looking at their menu on the wall constantly which makes me wonder if they do any training.\\n\\nThey threw in a few cookies and a coupon for free chips/soda which was nice but after nearly an hour that I had been sitting there it was seriously frustrating.

Just as good as on our last visit. Also had the squash stew ($18) and the hongos saltados ($19) again. Again, both were excellent. The flavors, presentation, portions were perfect.

We had the featured wine - an Oregon Tempranillo ($32) which was very good and a reasonable price. For dessert we shared the chocolate Andina whcih was criminally good and the creme brulee trio (grapefruit, cucmber and vanilla) and it was very good, albiet not as good as the orange.chocolate/vanilla trio we had on out last visit. Our server was fantastic. There when we needed him and gone when we didn't. He also comped the creme brulee for us as a graduation congrats.

Just not well-made at all... I had to ask for something to water it down. (So unlike me!!) The price on the drinks was what I would expect in the city...like $12-15 for a cocktail. My parents thought this was overpriced, but they are suburbanites, so anything more than Bertuccis would charge for a drink is too much in their mind.  \\n\\nWe then ordered apps, our meals and a bottle of wine. Of course there was nothing less than $60 bottles on the wine menu... of course. The apps were what I expected...like $9/salad-$15/tartare. And they were very good.

So, faced with a pho-less night, I tried to order it for delivery.The broth arrived at room temperature and in a separate container from the vermicelli, veggies, and raw beef. Granted, it was pretty cute when my dog stole a piece of beef before I could get to it, but I was a little nonplussed at the thought of raw beef in tepid broth... After microwaving everything together for 3 minutes, I had a sizable bowl of pho-flavored bath water with rubber pucks of meat poking through my noodles. Yes, I could have nuked it sans meat, but at the time, all I could think of was, \\"Need pho!

The broth was weak, and no amount of onion could have made it savory... \\n\\nThis sad panda couldn't find consolation in the spring rolls and mango boba smoothie I had to order to achieve the delivery minimum. There were barely any tapioca pearls in my smoothie and they were all so frozen that they didn't go up the straw. The spring rolls were rubbery and had very little meat in them.\\n\\nSo, how is this my fault? Well, pho for delivery was just a bad call on my part. It's served fresh by venders in Vietnam for a reason: the window to eat it is very small. Noodles get soggy; broth gets cold. Also, it's not like the service aspect of the meal was poor. Delivery was before anticipated and the driver was nice. But, here's the kicker, I live literally spitting distance from Kiengiang, who is, apparently, a purveyor of the best pho known to Yelp... but they don't deliver. I suffered a crappy meal because I was too lazy to do take-out instead. FOR SHAME, DAWN O! FOR SHAME!\\n\\nBottom line, I'll never order delivery from here again. I'd go to the restaurant if someone else was paying... Put I'm not spending my money on what I just tried to eat ever again. Would it have just been easier to say, \\"Food sucked; don't eat here.\\"?

I ordered their Italian wrap (only white wraps available, no whole wheat or sun-dried tomato, or spinach) with meatballs (which were small and DRY) with some cold veggies and spicy sauce It is completely impossible to eat this with your hands but is served in a foil wrap on a paper tray liner instead of a plate so I was picking paper and foil out of my fork before each bite.

But we have never eaten here on a Sunday when the menu is fixed with the 'chef' choices.  If you go to Lenoir on any other day besides Sunday, for a set price you pick three dishes from several different categories.  On Sundays, we found out, the menu is fixed with a first, second, third and fourth course.  For an additional amount you can pair it with wine.  We opted for a very tasty bottle of a Red (blend) from Paso Robles because neither myself or dinner companion care for whites, which is what the menu was mostly paired with.  \\nThe first course was a pickled egg that sat on  top of potato salad.  The menu described it comes with an herb salad.  This was a heavy, over salty dish that had no fresh greens whatsoever.  The second dish was a rice crusted fish with an artichoke curry and Brussels sprouts.  Again, way over salted with a extremely bland curry.  The third dish, perhaps the most disappointing was a sour rabbit boudin.  I'm not sure what this was except a strange mess  of breading?  The dinner was wrapped up with a chocolate pot de creme with shortbread cookies and grapefruit.  The pot de creme was extremely heavy and super thick, not anything like pot de cremes I have had before.  The shortbread cookies were yummy but the grapefruit slices they put on top of the cookies just made them soggy.\\nThe service was meh.  Most of the dishes were put down in front of us without any description and the fish dish came to us so hot it burned your hands if you touched the plate.  The server seemed more interested in washing bar glasses than anything else.\\nThe restaurant never filled up which was an indication we didn't get the memo about Sunday nights being the step child of the rest of the week.  The feel was that the menu items from the week before were re purposed and over salted to compensate?  The delicious, fresh, local veggie dishes that this restaurant is known for were non existent last night.  Our tab with tip, wine and dinner was a little over 160 bucks.  For that amount you should be able to get a pretty great meal here in Austin!\\nLenoir is closed on Mondays and my suggestion would be to give everyone off both Sunday and  Monday."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Industrial vibe with fish focus.

I used to go there every weekend and enjoy their interesting and tasty food and well made espresso drinks. This place was the epitome of \\"cool\\" Austin, from the community collaborative graffiti in the bathroom to the ramshackle appearance of the whole place. *note my extensive use of the past tense. \\n\\nThis weekend I visited Bouldin Creek at their new location, just a few blocks south of their old one on S. 1st. I was excited to see the new space, but that excitement was rapidly deceased. Firstly, this is no longer a coffee house, it's a restaurant. Coffee houses do not have table service!!! There are many good reasons for this, but let me list a few: 1. Less relaxing/home-like experience. (Getting your drink at a counter, getting your own napkins, silverware, sugar, etc., and then going to sit at a table of your choosing makes a coffee shop feel like home. No one bothers you...its just you, your coffee/food, your friends.) 2. When you pay up front, you can leave whenever you like. No waiting around for your server to bring the check, then waiting for the check to come back, yada yada yada. 3. getting interrupted is not relaxing. (Servers coming by every few minutes to ask if you need more coffee, or more to eat, or more water, etc.,etc. These things create a pressure for you to (a) buy more stuff or (b) leave so they can seat other customers.) 4. People go to coffee houses to avoid going to restaurants, because RESTAURANTS AREN'T A COOL PLACE TO SIT AND RELAX AND DRINK COFFEE!!!\\n\\nBesides the table service, there are some other things that I dislike about the new location. The main room is very noisy and bright. There are concrete floors and a high ceiling with no acoustic treatment. This makes for a very noisy, tinny-sounding room that makes for a much less enjoyable ambiance. Also, the quirkiness scale seems to have dropped from a 8-9/10 to 2-3. \\n\\nBouldin Creek still has great food--likely even better than before, and pretty good coffee. My oven cake breakfast was scrumptious. The bathrooms were spotless and functioning, and they still have nice people working there and the service was good and friendly. But, this place is just not that special anymore, and its not a coffee house.

When they bulldozed the place for the new Rosedale Village shopping center, I was immensely relived that Elsi's was reborn not too far down the road.  My family goes to Elsi's at least once every couple of weeks - we always go for breakfast on weekends when they have posole.  Their posole is to die for - chunky chicken pieces and hominy in a velvety chicken broth.  The posole comes with a plate of cabbage, spices, onions, a lime wedge, and pepper flakes for adding in at the last minute for extra crunch and tang. I could go on and on and on about the posole, but I'll stop now.  I also like the Salvadorian breakfast - a huge tamale, two eggs your way, beans and corn tortillas.  Mmmmm.  \\n\\nWe seem to get the same server every time we go - she's a sweetheart.  A few months ago she started giving two quarters to my kids after breakfast so they could go get gum out of the gumball machine at the front of the restaurant.  Since then, we've always tipped her extra to cover the 50 cents plus a little more just for being so nice and spending her hard-earned money on my spoiled kids.\\n\\n I've gone to Elsi's for lunch too, just not as often as breakfast, but can still highly recommend the tilapia special on Fridays.  \\n\\nEvery time I even think about moving away from Austin, I think, nope, I can't, because I won't be able to get Elsi's posole there."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Had to come to check it off the box, but honestly, if you're visiting like we were, it's not worth the wait in line.

No one looked out of place. \\n\\nThe wait staff was outstanding--everyone from our cute and helpful waitress (sorry I didn't get her name to give her a shout out, but she had dark hair and a small gold septum ring), to the food runners, and bussers were friendly, helpful and seemed like they genuinely enjoyed being there. No sh*tty attitudes, no pretense. The vibe was, \\"We've got great food and we want you to enjoy your time with us.\\" And we did. They even treated my 14 year-old daughter like a grown-up. Whoever trains and/or manages the floor staff--kudos!\\n\\nSeated literally, seconds before happy hour ended, our waitress promised to honor the happy hour menu prices and told us to take our time. Even when the rest of our party arrived 10 minutes later, it was the same deal. Nice. I've been to so many places where they just shrug and say, \\"So sorry--happy hour JUST ended. It's in the computer so I have to charge you regular price.\\"  \\n\\nAndina's special cocktail menu is simple and impressive. Not a fan of real sweet cocktails, I ordered a Ron-yki-√≥n because it sounded delicious: roasted ginger rum shaken with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, lime juice and cane sugar, served with a cardamom-sugar rim. How was it? Two words: Oh. Yes. Slightly sweet with a delightfully smokey taste and a light burn on the back end. My daughter loved her cocktail too--a Virgin Mojito.\\n\\nWe ordered several small plates (\\"medium sized\\" plates at our server's suggestion) and shared rather than order entrees. I mean, come on--it's a tapas place! All the food did not arrive at once--our waitress explained she staggered the order so we wouldn't be overwhelmed with dishes. Our dishes included:\\n\\n* Tabule de Quinua - lime-scented quinoa salad with avocado, cotija cheese and olives.  A sexy take on tabbouleh but this is made with quinoa rather than bulgar. Perfect flavor and texture and slightly orgasmic. You might need a cigarette after this. Very much like my favorite quinoa tabbouleh at Continental in Philly,\\n\\n* Esparragos Peruanos - grilled asparagus brushed with chimichurri. Simple, clean, fresh. The asparagus bathes your tongue and your head with fragrant goodness.\\n\\n* Yuca Rellena  -yucca croquettes stuffed with mozzarella and cotija cheese, served over huanca√≠na sauce. It's like tender yucca stuffed with crack, served over a creamy, savory crack sauce.\\n\\n* Conchas a la Parmesana - bay scallops baked with Grana Padano cheese and lime butter. Large bay scallops swimming in a creamy sauce and lightly browned. The omnivores, especially my 14 year old daughter, were making many food-lust noises. \\n\\n* Chicharrones de Pollo - crispy golden chicken studded with quinoa, served with salsa agridulce. The meat people raved that the flavors and texture were perfect. Vegetarian or not, anything breaded and perfectly fried looks amazing.\\n\\nWe had a few other small plates as well--all equally, \\"yumsters\\" as my wife likes to say. For dessert we shared the Plato de Crema Quemada--three pots of cr√®me br√ªl√©e, each with a different flavor. Perfectly crafted creamy desserts with the signature crunchy sugar glazed top.  \\"Yes, please and thank you,\\" my mouth said. My daughter chose the sorbet of the day which was more like a delicate lime ice cream laced with cayenne. This was a magical combination of sweet, tangy, cold and spicy.\\n\\nWe left just as the live music was starting--a Williamburg-esqe hipster trio. Who knew? If we did, we might have arrived and left later. Andina is a foodie's dream. It epitomizes everything you want the Portland food experience to be."},{"name":"The Steakburger","address":"7120 NE Hwy 99","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"still good after all these years!  though a bit more spendy, but what isint?  i love supporting the mom and pop places!"},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The ramen here is probably the best I've had in Boston so far, and I'm pretty sure nowhere else can beat this place anytime soon.

It was even better paired with Grillo's pickles. I don't normally like ordering grilled cheese out because it can tend to be too dry, but this place does it right. The bacon was diced as well, almost like bacon bits. All the flavors melded together really well and nothing was overpowering. Loved the mix of cheeses. The poutine was also delicious, and what I would expect poutine to taste like. I loved the fresh cut fries, the gravy was savory and coated the fries very well. The cheese curds were abundant and flavorful in their own right. The staff at Roxy's took everything into consideration -- since I got my meal to go, they included the gravy in a to-go container seperate from the fries and cheese curds so the fries wouldn't get soggy. This was a really nice touch and one I didn't expect. I guess the only downside is the price. With tip, my meal was 20 dollars.

We arrived on a Sunday night and the jazz trio was playing great bossa/samba and django-style tunes. We sat in the bar area which is nicer than the main dining room although both feature prominent rich red/orange/brown colors. The fireplace is a nice touch. \\n\\nThe cocktails looked great but my party stuck with wine. The Choros a la Chalaca (Mussels with a creole salsa of corn and tomato) looked amazing but the taste was off. It felt like eating cold mussels and corn salsa. Nothing combined them together. We tried again with another tapas, Conchas a la Parilla (Scallops with garlic lime butter sauce) and met with failure again. This time, the scallop, which looked succulent with grill marks in a zesty limesauce tasted only of char. Any heat or acidity that the sauce should've provided was compeletly undectable to me. Andina also scored poorly on its salsas. Bread is served with three salsas and while the mild salsa is good, the hotter ones are too sweet and too granular for the bread. \\n\\nAndina did deliver, however, on the main coures. The yellow fin tuna dish (Atun con Tacu Tacu) was fantastic. The lentil tacu-tacu went well with the fish and was ultimately balanced by endives and citrus. Another hit was the Bistec a la Peruana (Ribeye Peruvian Style). A large piece of grilled-to-perfection ribeye with a tamale-style corn and fava bean puree. Again the flavors match perfectly and I like the accompaniment of extra vegetables: cipollini mushrooms, shitake? mushrooms, and some grilled asparagus to provide various additions to the beef.\\n\\nI know there is much raving about Andina and I can see why. It's fun to go there. I loved the band and I love the whole feel of the place. But the food has a long way to deliver. The recipes are still in need of tweeking and I am guessing the cooks are overwhelmed in the tapas department which results in poorly composed or prepared dishes.

Let me start by saying the ambiance is great!! Perfect for a chill night with friends or good for a romantic date night. Really love the decor and the big windows! \\nWe were a group of 7, I made a reservation, and the table was all ready for us when we arrived. The waitress came over and asked us if we wanted anything to drink, no introduction or anything. I was not even sure if she was our waitress until she came back and wanted to take our order. A little strange and cold. We ordered a few cocktails and they were good! Small but strong. We ordered a couple appetizers. The Brussels sprouts were amazing! We also got the smoked salmon spread which was...weird. Good portion of salmon but not really flavorful and definitely not smoked as the menu said but it was fine. We ordered dinner and I got their summer pasta which was fantastic! My husband got the ribeye steak which was the most expensive menu on the item and it was awful. The plate came out looking like a mess. My husband didn't like it and I thought he was being dramatic and picky so I tried it myself and sure enough is was tasteless! Ribeyes are known to be flavorful, in certain this was not even a ribeye cut of meat. There was no \\"ribeye\\" in it, the flavor was bland and it wasn't at all tender. There was no seasoning on it at all and my husband really had a hard time eating it. I think that it was a cheaper cut of meat that they are selling as a ribeye, so disappointing. The food was definitely hit or miss for everyone at the table.\\nOverall the ambiance is what would bring me back but I don't know if that's enough. The service was awkward, cold and slow. And we also had an automatic gratuity added to our checks which was fine but it was 20% which I find to be a little presumptuous (even though we almost ALWAYS tip 20%), and the waitress never mentioned it to us so I'm glad that I caught it before everyone started adding even more to their bills.

Our waiter recommended the Malbec to pair it, and I hesitated, hating Malbec, but his passion convinced me to try it and it indeed paired perfectly--fruity and bold with hickory notes that balanced the smoke of the lamb.

Parking is a tad bit hard to find, since they're mostly resident parking only but I guess after 6pm you're good to park.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nSo, after reading great reviews about their Greek salad w/steak tips I decided to give it a try. My boyfriend ended up getting a medium meatball sub. The food was awesome! The salad was a little small but the steak tips were wicked full of flavor.

He sighed and said \\"sure.\\" Then he made me go over to a different spot and handed me the fork with an attitude, \\"here!\\" As if I was inconveniencing him. Totally unnecessary.

I said I do not care where we go as long as I get brunch. He took me to Bouldin Creek Cafe.  The wait was 45 minutes. During that time we walked around in the front lawn where people were selling different things such as apothecary herbs, stones, necklaces, clothes, hats, key chains, art, and mugs.  While we waited I also saw women with drinks that looked delicious. I asked one of the ladies what she was drinking, and she said, The Beyonce, she said it is like a mimosa with hibiscus.  Once we were seated I ordered, The Beyonce, and I also ordered the Tofu Neal (tofu scramble) and a hash cake.  My bf got an omelette. The Beyonce drink was very sour, I did not like it, I added a bunch of salt which helped.  The Tofu Neal dish however was amazing. I loved it! My bf thought his omelette was good. I was in shock because he always says the food is either okay or bad.  I didn't think it possible for him to find something he liked outside of Atlanta (except for Gourdough). Anyway I will never drink one of their drinks again but if I go to Austin again I am definitely going back for the food.  If you're from Houston, this place has better tasting food than Baby Barnaby's.

Is it a hot day? Get the Ruth or a little dog. You can session these babies all afternoon.

I think I got those details right. It was forgotten to the annals of history and then recovered by Alan and his mentor, Fred Eckhardt, the namesake of the Fred ale (a potent blend of sweet Belgian flavors, with more hops, a la PNW).\\n\\nHold onto your butts!\\n\\nSpeaking of Fred, if you like Whiskey, get on that Bourbon Fred or Adam from the Wood. \\n\\nCherry Adam from the Wood?

Chuck and Alan really put together some sheer brilliance on that end. Beyond that- it's so well-priced for what it is. \\n\\nThe staff is my favorite staff anywhere, period. They are a family and you can feel that vibe. They give money back from their draft and food sales to guide dogs for the blind. The prices are super reasonable for the quality. \\n\\nThe only way I can see you not liking this place is if you are unreasonable about needing reservations (they don't make them- it's a tasting room).\\n\\nIf your tongue works, and you like good beer and a place that puts family and friends first, this is it. There's no better brewery in town (dig the Michael  Jackson...no, not that one, the beer hunter...) article on the wall.

I really hope the owners/managers get to read this because we had the worst waitress ever. The food has always been good at this place, and there are certain dishes that are better than others, but overall we've never been disappointed by the food -- especially brunch! Anyway, on to the waitress who was appalling. \\nMy fiance and I took our parents here to celebrate our engagement. We were sat outside at a tiny table that could fit five, not six, comfortably and asked if we could move to add another empty table to a) be more comfortable and b) move out of the way of the foreboding rain. The space was not even full, but our waitress, who was acting like it was our last day and approached our table without greeting us, was like, \\"That's for another party.\\" When I asked, \\"What are we going to do if it rains? It's going to get my dad sitting at the end wet,\\" she responded with, \\"I don't know what you're going to do.\\" While answering, she accidentally spilled my mom's water and then said, \\"I'll talk to the hostess.\\" Minutes later, we saw her in the parking lot talking on the phone. A manager came out and actually handled the situation with grace, telling us to move in closer as he added an umbrella to shield us from the rain. He immediately had the screens put up around us. Our waitress returned and asked, \\"Are you more comfortable now?\\" Yes, we were. We received one main dish and a side dish, and then no other food came out for 15 minutes. The manager apologized and picked up the plates, saying all of the food would come out at once. What was nice was they brought out a complimentary appetizer. (It's interesting because that was the fourth time in a row we've received free food from the kitchen due to their mistake. There must be issues with expediting the orders.) Anyway, the food was good but my poor parents-- who had flown in all the way from Africa and were super jet-lagged-- already decided they'd never be back. They were just so confused about why Launderette received such great reviews in Texas Monthly and other news outlets and didn't know why we were having such a bizarre experience. You would think that a restaurant with such a great reputation would carefully choose the people they hire as waitstaff. Having worked in the food industry, I was surprised our waitress did not give a shit about her job.\\n\\nAlso, I miss the old pimiento cheese recipe.

There is a pseudo-fruit that grows as well called the cashew apple. The cashew apple has very very fragile skin and it doesn't transport like many of the other exotic fruits we eat (mangoes, bananas, etc). Cashews are native to Brazil and are very popular so I was excited to try the drink at the Brazilian bakery. Moving along...\\n\\nMy sandwich was tasty and satisfying. It was so big I couldn't even finish it! They had basically the entire kitchen on it, shy of the mayo :) Meat, LOTS of fresh veggies, cheese. It was a quite the party. The juice had a very interesting flavor unlike anything I'd ever had before. It is almost incomparable to any common fruit short of its sweetness. Give it a try. Make sure it is ice cold. \\n\\nAll in all, its definitely fun to step out of the norm and do something else. Plus supporting local businesses is always a bonus!

A small group of us walked into the former school, desperately trying to find the bar in the labyrinth of halls and doors, and finally stumbled into a two-story, dim-lit pub covered in creepy figurines, weird wall hangies and the smell of a grandmother's closet. To up the oddness, seeing well-dressed hipsters among the haunted mansion decor just made being there really weird.\\n\\nWe found a table downstairs near the bar and were helped by a kind, but clearly frazzled waitress.

Aside from the unsettling feelings, this bar is standard for its food and drinks. \\n\\nI don't know how else to describe this place or how it made me feel except to compare it to Ross and Monica's relationship on Friends.

This is the third restaurant from a local restaurant group which promotes farm to table where ever possible. The decor is a nice modern industrial with a touch of home. Exposed metal beams, marble table tops, and different sitting areas like the den and library where you can have dinner on a couch if you wanted. \\nSat in the bar area at the high top booth and the nice thing about the booth is when you sat in them you didn't sink into it, you were still at the right height to reach the table. Seems minor but makes the difference. \\nOur server was Chloe, let me stop right there. Every restaurant needs a Chloe. She was professional, quick and attentive, but more importantly knew everything about the menu and how things were prepared. We even tried to stump her on how they make certain drinks and she was right on it. She made the night enjoyable. \\nThey have an extensive list of cocktails, all with their own custom names, so make sure you read the descriptions! A must is the Black n Blue Martini. Absolute Elyx, with a mist of scotch around the glass. So you get the aromas of the scotch, but not the overpower full taste. Then it's toped with a blue cheese and bacon stuffed olive. To die for!\\nFor appetizers we had oysters and the jumbo crab cake. Oysters were fresh, but they had only one selection. I usually like to have a small sample of oysters from different regions. The crab cake had a nice crust to it and was very tasty full of real meat and not heavy with any sort of breading. \\nNow to the entree. Believe it or not I got the Long Island Duck, I didn't get steak at a steak house I never do this, but I'm glad I did. It was presented beautifully and just delicious. Cooked medium and just full of flavor, and a good portion for $34. My friend had the Steak Au Poivre with a red wine sauce and bone marrow. What I didn't understand they have a 16 oz New York sirloin for $48 and bone marrow for $8, and this dish was $42. If you like pepper this is for you, however the bone marrow, according to my friend, was not worth $8 if he had to pay for it. For sides we had the asparagus, local mushrooms and the potato gratin. All were great, the gratin was nice a smooth and the potatoes literally melted in your mouth. \\nBe prepared to pay some money here. Is it worth it, for what we got yes. I think some of the items on the menu are slightly overpriced, and especially for the area. You're not in downtown Boston, but this is a nice addition to the area.

We saw a movie in the theater (I can't  remember what it was though) we even ate at the restaurant (the Boiler Room had not yet opened).  We had fun exploring the property.\\n\\nIt has been a while since I last spent the night or caught a movie here but I still enjoy... just being here.   This place is what I think McMenamins does best.  Saving and re-purposing old buildings and making them a setting for great experiences.  What other company would do this? much less, this well? \\n  \\nWhen they made Kennedy School into what it is now, McMenamins was a company that was known for making beer and running bars.  Edgefield had just opened,  But they took the risk of doing this, here.  With that risk it is amazing that they have let the surrounding committee use so much of the space and from the beginning put so much effort into hosting community events.\\n\\nI love the old halls here.  They are filled with art and energy.  These halls and the gym and the restrooms by the gym are what really feels like a school to me.  \\n\\nLast St Patrick's day I was in the area and decided to stop by and get the stamps for my passport.  Every bit of the old school was open,  The gym was filled and people were watching musicians and kids dancing on the stage.

Yes, it was A LOT of food.  My friend and I waited weeks...months for a fancypants burger that we wanted to try.  With the coupon expiring in a couple of weeks, we decided to go when they advertised a burger with fried goat cheese, fried green tomato, arugula, topped with balsamic vinaigrette.  The deal started at 5:00.  We got there at 4:52.  I understand we were early, but really?!  We had to wait 8 minutes to order and the girl taking our order was quite snippy.  I thought to myself, \\"Whatever.  This place has that grungy feel.  Maybe she's just trying to act a part.\\"  We sit down and the bartender comes out with the beer.  He begins to tell us about the beer and then says, \\"Wait, do you guys even like beer?  You probably don't even care.\\"  Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.  My biggest pet peeve is being judged by people.  Just because my friend and I were wearing our Nike shorts and oversized t-shirts, and yes, we probably looked like sorostitutes, don't mean we are.  We had taken my lovely dog for a birthday stroll prior to coming.  And we LOVE beer, so back off.  Anyway, I was obviously offended by his comment.  We ordered fried pickles for our appetizer and they were quite delicious.  If you've ever been to a fish fry, the pickles tasted like they were in the same batter that is typically used for fish.  YUMMY.  They were served with a chipotle ranch/mayo something or another that I would have liked to drink.  I dipped my fries in there too.  We ordered our burgers med-rare, and they came out medium.  They were okay.  The goat cheese was actually put on the green tomato and then fried, which was awesome.  I would consider trying another non-fancy burger to give them a fair burger review.  The fries were pretty good.  Nothing to write home about.  The highlight of our visit was the boozy milkshake.  We ordered one called the Monkey Wrench that was peanut butter, chocolate malt, banana liquer, and chocolate vodka.  Holy moly.  It was AMAZING.  And strong.  Fried moon pies were weird and greasy.  They tasted like a mixture of a funnel cake and...well, something else.  \\n\\nWill I return to Grindhouse \\"Killer\\" Burgers?  Probably not anytime soon.

I don't get that .... seriously, I don't think we should be comparing restaurants in particular BY NAME we should be just writing about our particular experience with the restaurant we are reviewing. ALSO, naming another restaurant in your review is kinda, like advertising. Are we writing a review on this restaurant or pushing another restaurant?????\\n\\nMY REVIEW On Grass Fed:\\nI enjoy being able to call ahead & have good quality food with some nice twists too it. Besides Beef N' Burgers they offer some seafood and vegetarian items which is well noted by this non-meat eating consumer.  It's quick eats but on a much better note. It's Obvious !!! as soon as you walk in the door, it's not a sit down romantic night out with 4 star service!\\n\\nI didn't turn to yelpers for help on this restaurant nor many restaurants I've patronized sometimes i just stop in and take a chance. I'm happy I did w/ Grass Fed because I have a good go-to place from time to time.\\n\\nMy first stop in at Grass Fed just happened to be on opening day a few months back but I often take my time before writing a review. It was enjoyable enough for me to make a mental note that I wanted to return. On that first visit I sat at the informal counter, and it didn't resonate with me that the business didn't seem to know what direction it was going in. This Yelp-er wasn't confused or put-off. I could tell it was a new business, things were a little awkward but the shrimp Pow-Boy was great it had huge jumbo shrimp in it unlike many other places that use unappetizing popcorn size shrimp these babies had some bite to them and still do! Yum!, my shake was creative and de-lish.\\n\\nRegarding the concept ... It has been clear to me from day one ... you walk up and place your order with the cashier and go sit down and wait for your food. If you sit at the counter you get a menu then you get counter service. It seemed straight forward to me.... and still does. I think the ambiance speaks for its' self as being casual and minimalist. It's not a romantic get away, with candles and all the bells n' whistles.\\nI've read many reviews that  personally I whole hearted don't agree with, some of them going WAY too deep and being nit picky. All I can think of is holy crap what's the big deal it's not a fine dining experience.\\n\\n\\nYes ... I do agree paying extra for tarter sauce, tomato and other condiments we usually associate with a particular dish seems inappropriate but doesn't put me off enough to not go back OR complain about.\\n\\nSince my first visit I've called ahead for take out from them on several occasions and not been disappointed. One time I checked my order and a mistake had been make. The owner quickly corrected it and put in a couple of orders of fries on the house, what more could I have asked for??\\n\\nThe various all- natural holistic type gourmet burgers/sandwishes etc. are creative, and all natural products are used, hence you pay more for better products ... that's just the way it goes.

The bacon on the salad (which was one of 3 protein add-ons) was presented as 4 whole pieces of bacon on top of the salad. Do you realize how impractical it is to cut thick sliced bacon with a butter knife? For a salad that is already tossed, cut the freakin' bacon. Plus, this is way too much bacon for one person.

This salty fried goodness was drizzled with some sweet heaven and was some of the best calimari I've ever had.  I was with a bunch of rabbits who ordered either beet salads or the small salad, but a friend and I were there to eat, so I ordered the tuna and she ordered the scallops.  My tuna was cooked perfectly (rare) and was pretty good.  I didn't really care for what it was paired with or the sauce, but I ate it all.  My friend's scallops were served with gouda -- that's right -- grit cakes.  These were tasty.  Because it was my birthday, I got complimentary bread pudding with some ice cream.  Yummy.    \\n\\nThe service was the only downside to this place.  They were slammed, so, even with two servers per table, we still had to wait and flag them down.  I waited a while for a glass of wine and another companion had to wait to order also.  There are so many positives about this place, that I will definitely come back.  The decor is amazing.  I think it's an old warehouse, so the ceilings are extremely high with these huge red balloon-looking lanterns that are just extraordinary.  There were cool murals on the walls and kegs and wine inside the walls!  Can't say enough about the decor.  Best thing about this place:  they split the check with big parties (take note Nuevo Loredo)."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A tourist's rite of passage.\\n\\nIf you're holding a pink box of donuts... it's a sign that you're from out of town.

I really liked this one. It reminds me of Krispy Kreme donuts cream filled donuts, but better consistency and fluffier!\\n- Bacon Maple donut: My favorite!!

We stopped by during lunchtime and were the first customers through the door.  We were immediately greeted by who I presume to have been the owner.  He was friendly and courteous and inquired if we were having Brazilian-style BBQ for the first time (he did this for each new guest that entered the restaurant).  He offered a brief explanation of how his restaurant was set up.  We were seated, and he implored us to visit the salad bar.  \\n\\nThe salad bar was meagerly stocked, but it was adequate.  Who really goes to Brazilian churrascaria for the veggies anyway?  I sat down with my plate of salad, and soon after, the chefs came in quick succession offering slices and slices of perfectly grilled meat.  With the exception of the dry and overcooked pork tenderloin, the meat was juicy, fresh, well-flavored, and arrived in more than ample portions.  I thoroughly enjoyed the prime loin.  It was one of the tastiest pieces of meat I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  \\n\\nI highly recommend you come to this place, and I highly recommend you come here hungry.  If you want to eat Brazilian-style BBQ, you will not find a place better than this.  The value is tremendous.

It's one of those restaurants where you place your order at the register and then wait at your table for your food to be brought out.

I've always enjoyed their panini sandwiches the best, though, as they're pretty appetizing.\\n\\nMy favorites are the bourbon filet steak and the Waldorf chicken sandwiches.  The steak sandwich has caramelized onions, baby greens, and a tasty horseradish aioli.  The Waldorf chicken sandwich has chunks of their fire-grilled chicken together with fruits such as apples, grapes, and cranberries.  You have the option to mix it up and do half and half on sandwiches, salads, and soups.

As the parents of two small children we don't often get the chance to get dressed up and go out to a nice dinner so Valentine's Day is always special to us. After having a wonderful dinner meeting at Top of the Hub my husband told me about the amazing menu and service so we decided to abandon our 'usual' restaurant for Top of the Hub for Valentine's Day. When we made our reservation we were told nothing about the special Valentine's Day menu being the only menu available that night. When we arrived and realized that this was the case we almost just left but could not because there was another couple with us. After we sat down and began reading the menu I thought that after speaking with our waiter that he might be able to tone down the or offer other menu choices.  After telling the waiter that I don't like egg and asking if they could  not put that in two out of the five fixed choice courses I was told there were no changes and no substitutions. \\n\\nOnce we finally ordered my husband and I decided not to spend an extra $60 on the wine pairings which the waiter did not seem to appreciate and from that point on after we had finished our first drinks never asked again if we would like something else to drink, he just kept re-filling our water glasses. It was like we were being punished for not getting the wine pairings. I'm happy we didn't get the wine pairings because the other couple we were dining with didn't get the wine on time with any of the courses, they had completely finished their soup before the wine even showed up. \\n\\nObviously thanks to the presence of the egg I could not enjoy the first course. The mushroom soup was far too heavy for even a cream based soup and I was tasting the soup for the rest of the night until finally hours later I got home and was able to brush my teeth. The minimal entree choices were just depressing, I settled for the beef filet and while it was cooked adequately, I did not enjoy any of the sides that came with it. The salad course at the end also had egg in it, so after trying to pick around the flecks of egg I gave up because the salad just wasn't good enough to warrant such an effort. \\n\\nFor dessert there was a mediocre layer cake and once again not what I wanted, I had been looking forward to the warm chocolate cake listed on their regular dessert menu. The best part of the cake was the diamond engagement ring made from sugar, that was a nice touch and honestly the only part I enjoyed aside from my pomegranate mojito. This abysmal meal was given to us for the low low price of $125 per person. Honestly this menu felt like they were just cleaning out their pantries and coolers from the things that would soon be going bad. Never mind the fact that on any other day their tastings menu is only $77. Next year we will be going back to our standby restaurant the Capitol Grille where you can get the meal you want at half the price with significantly better service.\\n\\nSo, mediocre food, over embellished menu, mediocre service, and cut throat pricing ruined my Valentine's Day, thank you Top of the Hub for a less than quality experience."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It's not the best doughnut you've ever had, but it probably has the most unusual selection you've ever seen.

Get it and don't look back. It's super tender and moist, but don't wait too long for it to cool down because the gravy kinda congeals when it's cold (this probably won't be a problem because it's that good).

Little did I know that we wouldn't be seeing much of him throughout the evening (I don't remember his name, I just remembered he was a taller gentleman with long locs tucked in a low ponytail). As we sat down, we told our waiter (my sister and I) that we wanted to take our food \\"to-go\\" because we had another event to attend and we needed to leave by 11:30. At this time, it was around 10:30. Seemed like a reasonable amount of time. We didn't receive our food until about 11:15, mine was ordered correctly. My sister's food did not arrive in a to-go box like we ordered. She was about halfway done with her entr√©e (which was very small in proportion), and I asked him for the check, which we didn't receive until 12:15. I say again, 12:15. We ended up missing our event.\\n\\nAs a whole, it seemed like 75% of the birthday party was fed up with our waiter. We asked one waiter to find him while another random waiter refilled our glasses with water and removed our plates from the table. We spotted him a few times and tried to wave him down and get him to come to our table. He just stood there like a deer caught in head lights. One of my friends started waving like she was signaling a plane. Again, he just kept looking and didn't do anything.

One thing that I've been wishing you would change for so long, is those dang tables in the middle of the walkway.  It is nearly impossible to easily get past them, especially on a crowded night, and makes dancing a nightmare when you want to move around, godforbid, when you have to get by to use the restroom.  \\n\\nA recommendation to remedy that situation:  I understand that you need to have a certain amount of sitting space, but what if you take out those big square tables, and bring in one or two long and skinny ones.  About 12-15 inches wide, and about 4-5 feet long.  Make them sturdy.  You can keep the chairs on either side to accommodate the sitters and their beers/food, but you also free up a walkway for the patrons trying to get past them.  \\n\\nEven if you don't, i'll still be back and fight my way through the middle tables to dance to the sweet tunes of the evening."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands-down best tapas restaurant I've ever been to! \\n\\nMy family and I chose to dine at Andina during our recent foodie trip to Portland after hearing such raving recommendations from our colleagues and friends. And their raves were not in vain because it was seriously one of the best dinners I've had in a while! \\n\\nAmbiance: \\nClassy, elegant and sophisticated while still maintaining an air of casual fun without being pretentious. We sat in one of the booths near the bar with live music playing and couldn't have asked for a better seat! It was intimate without being too loud and it was fun without being eerily quiet. If you're looking for the ultimate quietness seating (more ideal for dates than fun family dinners), choose the courtyard option. \\n\\nService: \\nOur waiter was phenomenal! He was so helpful, attentive without being overbearing, and made some incredible recommendations. He was also quite the fun conversationalist and was such a hit at our table! \\n\\nDranks: \\nThe cocktails are to die-for! The Sacsayhuaman (habanero pepper vodka shaken with pureed passionfruit and cane sugar, served up with a sugar rim and cilantro leaf garnish) was our personal favorite. It was sweet with a slight kick of spiciness that drew you in like no other. Definitely consider ordering a cocktail or two before you choose to pop open wine bottles! \\n\\nFood: \\nEverything was overwhelmingly delicious and the family was unanimously impressed with the quality of food. The portions are decent and filling (not SF-portions, for sure).  We ordered the following: \\n1. Seco A La Nortena: Lamb shank slow-cooked in a cilantro black beer sauce \\n2. Arroz Con Pato: crispy duck confit and duck breast pan seared and paired with cilantro-infused rice in a savory-sweet passionfruit sauce\\n3. Lomo Saltado: Beef tenders wok-fried with onions, tomatoes, oyster sauce, garlic and aj√≠ amarillo \\n4. Hongos Saltados: wild mushrooms wok-fried with lots of veggies and garlic rice\\n5. Yuca Rellena: yuca croquetas stuffed with mozzarella and cotija cheese with huancaina sauce\\n6. Pimiento Piquillo Relleno: sweet piquillo peppers stuffed with quinoa, cheese and Serrano ham\\n7. The delicious complimentary bread with all the dipping sauces (the dipping sauces are amazing!)\\n8. Chocolate Andino dessert (quinoa flour brownie, chocolate ganache and Amarillo pineapple sauce) \\n9. Creme br√ªl√©e trio dessert \\n\\nEverything was decadent and cooked to perfection!

The wok fried veggies were a little odd paired with the traditionally Southern dish.

You can combo your meal (add a soft drink and a side item such as a bag of chips or an apple to your sandwich) for 2 bucks, then for an additional 50 cents you can swap out that snack for a warm cup of soup.  I was also able to easily swap out a healthy bottle of water for that soft drink.\\n\\nChicken noodle soup $2.49 a la carte had all the regular good stuff - noodles, carrots, celery, and the requisite chicken.
