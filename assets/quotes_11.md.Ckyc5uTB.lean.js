No air pockets in the outer crust, just way too hard in my opinion. \\n\\nSauce\\nGreat pizza its all about the sauce in my opinion. The sauce here tends to be more on the sweeter side. Overall good sauce, no real complaints. Cheese to sauce ratio was a bit low (again for my liking) as I prefer more sauce. \\n\\nToppings\\nMy order was half cheese, half pepperoni. They were good on their toppings. They did not under or over do it. So kudos for that. \\n\\nOverall\\nHonestly not my favorite. I just couldn't get over the crust but that's a personal preference.

The charcuterie consisted of two types of meat (sliced) that looked like prosciutto and salami, two slices of thick toast, a small hunk of cheese with local honey, and a small bowl of pickled veggies. It was good, but not the standout of the evening. The cheese was really hard and we struggled to cut of slices with our knives. I would have liked a softer cheese or maybe a cheese knife to help cut it. Not my favorite charcuterie board in town, but not bad at all.\\n\\nThe standout was the Blanca. The lemon ricotta was a stroke of genius and the pie was delivered incredibly quick. This pizza felt authentic and so fresh with the acidity of the lemon to cut the richness of the ricotta.

The price was quite high ($22) for an espresso-size rice portion, a mini fist-size salad, and two small tortillas with about 3-4 medium shrimps apiece. Desserts are also highly priced for the portions you get, $9.50 for 6 mini churros, and the lowest price on the dessert menu is $9. Not the best deals around, for sure. But, maybe they have to keep prices relatively high considering how there's very limited seating at night? It seems they can accomodate 5 large groups of 4-5 people indoors at most on any given day.\\n\\nFor house-turned-restaurants, I'd rather go to one that offers meals around $10 or less, some catchy songs (no music here unfortunately), and exciting vibes to put me in an explorer mode."},{"name":"Keegan's Irish Pub","address":"4687 S Atlanta Rd SE, Ste 224","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay, this spot has dropped up on my favorite list.

I had heard great things about the corn pesto pizza and the spicy paneer pizza. The spicy paneer was good but not as great as I thought it would be. Also, if you have food allergies, especially tree nuts, please be aware that the corn pesto pizza is made with walnuts. I found out the hard way when my son who is allergic to tree nuts had a reaction on the way home. Luckily, it's not a severe reaction, but I was sure that it was something in the pesto, so much so that I called them and they confirmed that it did in fact contain walnuts. I was surprised considering the menu board notes that the butter paneer has nuts. So I felt confident when I placed my order that the two pizzas I selected would be safe for my son. I am disappointed about this. I did tell the man I spoke with on the phone that they need to update their menu board to be respectful of customers with food allergies.

The crispy wild boar ribs were amazing, as well as the beer battered Florida rock shrimp with Texas ginger honey glaze.  I am also a big fan of their pickles (cucumber, carrot, jalapeno) and their coriander mustard.  Unfortunately that's where the fun ends.\\n\\nThe brisket was dry, and my hubby said what I was thinking: \\"I prefer Rudy's\\".  Funny, I saw a lot of reviews that said that.  The jalapeno sausage, while good, didn't seem to have any jalapeno in it, and at four bucks a link, are they kidding?  The sides were just blah... the mashed potatoes weren't very good, nor the grits.  The mac and cheese was too rich, they need to omit whatever offending cheese they use from their recipe.  Fried okra, meh.  Uninspired, nothing special.  \\n\\nWe got the coconut cream pie for dessert.  The crust was very hard and hubby didn't care for it at all.  Despite the fact we were upstairs right by the bar, the waitress took forever getting drink refills and I almost went up to the bar myself at one point.  The icing on the cake, though, was when we got the bill.  $35 EACH for two Johnny Walkers.  Their rib-eye cost $36, are they seriously going to charge for a drink what it cost for a meal?  That is absolutely ridiculous!  So we spent SEVENTY dollars on TWO lousy drinks (and slow service to boot).  We could have purchased two steaks!\\n\\nIt's disappointing when you pay good money for a meal and it doesn't meet your expectations.  But I am beyond disappointed about the $70 surprise.  I feel robbed, of money, and the experience of eating at this establishment, because it was quite an awkward moment for my hubby (who ordered the drinks), and myself of course, when the rest of our party saw the price of the drinks.

I'm really looking forward to taking a bunch of Orlando Yelpers here in January for a UYE!\\n\\nI went on a whim with a couple friends last Saturday night.  We put our names in and were quoted a 45 minute to an hour wait time.  I provided my cell number and was told I would receive a text once our bay was ready.  We found a spot at the bottom floor bar, ordered some food and next thing we know, we got a text telling us which bay to go to and someone would greet us there.  Our 45 minute to an hour wait turned into 15 minutes, which was amazing!  The bartender closed us out and transferred our food order to our bay number so it would come out to our playing area.\\n\\nWe went to our bay and were greeted by an employee who set me up with my new membership card.  I had bought one online prior to coming, so the setup process was fairly quick and easy.  Once our names were put into the system, it was time to golf!  They have clubs at each bay for men and women, ranging from 3 irons to drivers, and rental of the clubs is included in your game play.  The timer of your hour doesn't start until you begin your first game.  There are a lot of different ways you can play.  The two games we played were (1) hitting the ball as far as you could to get points; and (2) trying to hit your ball in the yellow, green, or red zones for points.  There are games to challenge you more and others for just fun.  The golf balls have a tracking device in them, so you can see on the screens just how far you hit your ball, if it hit a target, and how fast it was going.  Super neat!\\n\\nThere are servers that will come to your table so you can order food and/or drinks.  The prices are very reasonable for this type of place and in a touristy location.  I had the bacon mac n' cheese spring rolls with a side of ranch for my snack and I loved them!  The green chile in the cheese sauce was a perfect compliment to spice them up a bit.\\n\\nWhen you have about 15 minutes remaining, your bay representative will come over to ask if you'd like to add an additional hour to your play time.  If not, you can finish out your time/game and they will bring you the check.  Since each person will have a membership card to play, you can opt to split your check at the end and the hour of time will be divided between however many people played on your bay.  If you go after 5:00 p.m. it's $50.00 per hour (which isn't so bad once it's split between the people at your bay).  With three of us playing, we were able to finish 2 games within the hour.\\n\\nThe only negative to my experience here was that we were placed on the ground floor. \\n Obviously, one of the cool things about Topgolf is that there are multiple levels, and I think it would have added more fun to my experience being a bit higher up.  Hopefully when we go for our UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) we will be able to be on the second or third floor of the complex to have the full experience."},{"name":"Moshi Sushi Bar","address":"2152 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"3.5","text":"I figured I'd write an update since I've been here more so many times since my last review and haven't updated.

As always, everything was top notch and just as perfect as it gets.\\n\\nOne thing I love about their sushi here, and each time I come back I remember, is that they don't *overdo* the rice on the rolls.  There is always just a thin layer of rice--it's all about the main ingredients here, ie, the fish.  It's always fresh and served cold like sushi should be--and tender, it just dissolves in your mouth, you never have a \\"chew, chew, chew, spit-in-to-napkin\\" episode when you eat the rolls here.  It's truly amazing.\\n\\nI started with a tempura appetizer and some hot sake.  I later switched to a healthy pour of really good viognier and had the crab/seaweed salad which is definitely 2DF (to die for).  For dinner I had a spicy tuna roll, california roll and a rainbow roll.  The rainbow roll here is absolutely the best I've ever had.  So much care and pride is put into the sushi here--it's nothing but a passionate art, and I almost feel guilty eating David's (the sushi chef) creations because they are so perfect and beautiful.\\n\\nThe couple I ate with tonight are also regulars.  I've taken others here before and people often complain about the wait for the sushi.  Well, what you wait for is what you get.  And, what you get is good.

I came in here a Saturday, mid morning for doubles, yes doubles, only doubles. But ended up leaving with doubles and a chicken roti.\\n\\nCould it be that I was unconsciously influenced by the 5 customers ahead of me all purchasing roti. My eyes widened as I saw the size of the roti skin and when it was finally wrapped with its hidden treasures, I knew it would be perfect. About 5 hours later I got the chance to sink my teeth in and I smiled. It still tasted fresh as it was wrapped in both grease proof paper and foil.   \\n\\nOh wait! The doubles, how could I forget. What stood out about the doubles was the runny tamarind sauce that was evenly spread right through. I tasted the sauce with every bite unlike other eateries with a thicker sauce which tends to stick at one spot of the doubles, preventing you from enjoying the tangy tamarind taste with every bite. The texture of the dough was perfectly soft and there was enough chick peas. It was good! \\n\\nDon't forget if you intend on getting a roti here please get a red Solo (soft-drink) to wash it down.

Poor choice.\\n\\nTo try to sum up the problems succinctly (though it won't be by the time I get further in, so hang on):\\n\\n*Lackluster and inattentive service - things like forgetting my first club soda then never asking about a refill (I found out later my beloved went to find our server to ask for more while I was in the ladies)\\n\\n*The kind of delay on food that makes you think that on a busy-ish night, our server wasn't prompt in putting orders in; being a server myself, I know these things are more likely to happen when I'm not super busy because I might pay a little less attention.\\n\\n*The menu. Here's where the Big Problem began. When we go to a steak place that one would consider \\"upscale,\\" we're used to the whole order your steak, then sides are a la carte and sized to share. Cool. After our usual calamari (good) and slow to arrive shared Caesar (unmemorable), came the steaks: med for him, med rare for me, and the mushrooms, but no potato. The bigger problem? Turns out there is teeny (teeny tiny) print somewhere on the menu that says \\"all steaks served with mashed potatoes and an onion ring, over a bed of burgundy jus.\\" Or something like that because we failed to notice this asterisk and our server \\"finally figured out that was why our steaks came out wrong.\\" First problem, why in the world are the steaks served with a dollop of mashed potatoes and an onion ring on top? This just makes no sense to me- because you're already going to order the sides you want, because this seems so...70s?, because this is just....weird - and I hate mashed potatoes. And the second problem was the sauce.\\n\\n*That leads me to a lesson well learned for me: ask about alcohol in ANY dish. I can't have it in any form, and it didn't dawn on me to ask. I am still learning about all the ways and kinds of foods that contain it. Since I didn't know there was any sauce on the steak (that's an obvious source of alcohol I'd already figured out), I didn't think to ask. When the steaks arrived, my beloved and I took one look at each other and I said \\"please don't leave that with me- I can't eat it.\\" Our server didn't seem to get my simple sentence and stuttered about my why. A manager came over and the waiter brought the steaks back with him, and they tried to explain the alcohol was cooked out. I know that it isn't all cooked out (did find a chart on that but didn't have the numbers all memorized then) and finally had to tell them \\"alcohol in food is a non-negotiable.\\" \\n\\n*This whole uncomfortable exchange was made worse when they left the mushrooms (I hadn't double checked but now was alert to how they had been cooked- and one smell confirmed some kind of burgundy wine). A manager came back about five minutes later when he realized this as well. The staff just fumbled over what to do. To me, it was uncomfortable and their repeated attempts to replace a new steak, offer just veggies and \\"make sure cooked ok\\" etc just turned into a long production (see my review for The Optimist to read how staff can handle \\"wrong\\" dishes well) and turned me off of everything.\\n\\nWe have a good sense of humor so we quickly turned this into a \\"what can we learn from this\\" talk and my boyfriend said the steak they did bring back to him without sauce (he is not as strict about alcohol content as I am) was acceptable. \\n\\nOn the whole, the experience just left a bad taste in our mouths (ha). They took my steak and the mushrooms off the bill (not the potato, but we weren't going to prolong our time there to ask) and frankly, I know that where I work, we would have done more if not even comped the whole bill.\\n\\nLots of other places to get calamari and steaks, and have better communication with staff."},{"name":"Pizza Bruno","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I have been here 3-4 times (we are local) so this is more of a composite review.

Today I wasn't in any particular rush, so I decided to swing by.\\n\\nI started with banh beo as an appetizer. It has a pretty strong smell because of the dried shrimp, but its taste is much tamer.  It's a sweet, sour, salty, and refreshing appetizer.  Huong's version is pretty standard.\\n\\nAs for bun bo hue, it's another great Viet soup that for some reason doesn't get nearly as much mainstream love as pho.  It's rich, spicy, complex, heavy on the lemongrass flavor, and has a much thicker noodle than pho.  The broth at Huong's is the truth.  Among the ingredients are slices of roasted beef, Vietnamese balogna, pig's foot, and a few cubes of congealed pork blood.  Now I know the last two items can lead you to ordering that safe bowl of pho ga (chicken), but don't be scared or you'll end up missing out on this fantastic soup. They state \\"pig foot\\"  on the menu, but it's usually a pork hock.  If you're not interested in the blood cubes, they're very easy to eat around.  They're like dark tofu cubes.

Great for big groups, and the dinner all you can eat is considerably better than the lunch, so definitely go after 5 PM.

They had 6 flavors that day (Bacon, Dirty Wu, Ray Honey and Sea Salt, Nutella, Cinnamon & Sugar, Lemon) and we ordered all of them and doubled up on the Dirty Wu and Raw Honey and Sea Salt as they seemed to be the most popular ones. We also got Matcha Latte and Raw Honey Latte. \\n\\nAlthough it took a bit to come out, it was worth it. The donuts are small but declious and full of flavor. They come out hot! Crispy on the outside and fluffy and warm on the inside. All the flavors were amazing and I can see why people line up for this mini donuts.

It was so large that they ate the chocolate whipped cream (yummy!) and the chocolate ice cream, but had to bring home the two large brownie wedges.

However, I chose to order the chocolate creme br√ªl√©e, as it is one of my all time favorite desserts, and not something easily found.

After much indecisiveness, I chose the Rainbow Maki and one of my favorites- the Spicy Tuna Roll. The Rainbow Maki was truly a work of art presenting itself in true fashion as a California roll topped with perfectly cut and generously-sized pieces of salmon, tuna, whitefish, and avocado. Almost too pretty to eat, yet I did not hesitate to dig right in. The Tuna roll was nicely decorated with a spicy mayo sauce and a good kick to it. I cannot quite remember the maki rolls my friend chose, but she stated \\"This is really good,\\" not only once, but twice. \\n\\nOne little disappointment tonight was the temperature inside the restaurant.

Le Cellier definitely takes the prize for best bread basket in Disney World with their pretzel rolls and pepita-studded whole wheat bread. (The pretzel rolls dipped in the cheese soup beats a spoon every time. ) We split the filet with risotto, and got a few sides to share, the creamed spinach and the whiskey caramel Brussel sprouts. The filet was great, but those Brussel sprouts stole the show. They were quite probably, the best Brussel sprouts I've ever had. The desserts were good, with the pecan butter tart being my favorite. \\n\\nThe ambience is very romantic, their wine list extensive, the service friendly, and the food delicious.

I had a positive dining experience with Seito Sushi at the Turkey Lake location and was stoked they actually offered take-out. I ordered chirashi-don classic, bc it was what I ordered previously at the other location and the uni was beckoning me! \\n\\nWhen I arrived at the Baldwin Park location, I immediately appreciated the equally nice, albeit more formal ambience. However, I was peeved that the hostess did not acknowledge me and then told me to go to the bar to pick up my food. The bar staff was nice and greeted me though. \\n\\nI should have checked my food before leaving. There were no ginger or wasabi in my chirashi. It was hefty with rice and sparse on the selection. I understand these two restaurants may operate differently and the selection can vary depending on many factors. However, I was severely disappointed in my $30 chirashi. It had like maybe 4 types of sushi (one of it was medium fatty tuna), tamago (egg custard), and the rest were seaweed salad and squid salad. Of course I still ate it because it wasn't inedible, but I can't reiterate my disappointment enough. Maybe it was because they don't normally get an order for chirashi to-go...that I am grateful for...but at the same time, the selection was a pittance. I will probably not order take-away from here again. I am still in search of a really good sushi house which offers traditional omakase and sushi...until then, Seito is still sits on top of the list."},{"name":"Treaty Oak Distilling","address":"16604 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"What a great place to sample great Gin and Bourbon.

I asked if they offered wifi, and he was really arrogant and rude about it, saying that there was sometimes a waiting list, some other stuff.  My wife noticed that he had an attitude also.  Look, if a customer asks for the bistro's wifi password (there was a wifi network called \\"MothersGuest\\") then the answer is easy and requires no convoluted language or arrogance.  Either supply the password to the paying customer or tell him/her that the wifi network is not available to paying customers.

Thirty minutes later, he went to the counter and asked for progress. The woman found his pizza and handed it to him.

I went to Mike's on a slow day, asked for 1/2 dozen and the woman behind counter asked if I wanted white or yellow cream. I was plucked and asked what she meant. She picked up two plastic sleeves, one filled with a white substance and the other a yellow substance. I went with the white thinking this would be something close to the Sicilian filling I was hoping for.  It was, sort of, but it was awfully sweet. I never did find out what that yellow stuff was, but I imagine it was a some kind of facsimile of pastry cream (which is what you'd get in, say, Rome, if you went into a pasticceria and ordered up some canolli and didn't specify Sicilian ricotta filling).  These fillings were contained in commercially-sealed plastic sleeves, normally referred to as Cryovac bags. At the time of my visit, it was highly unlikely that such a small operation would own one of those commercial vacuum sealing machines, leading me to ask myself, hey, do they even make this stuff themselves?

We arrived at around 12:10 with no reservation and were seated almost immediately. Early on in our vacation planning, Le Cellier was a must do because of the ambience and escape from the rest of the park that it offers, and this was apparent as soon as we were seated. The interior was indeed reminiscent of a wine cellar and it seemed like it was evening inside. As a party of two, we were seated along a wall about 1 1/2 feet away from our neighboring party of two. This was fine for lunch, but if you are celebrating a special occasion or do not necessarily want to hear the next table's entire conversation, I would keep this in mind for your visit. \\n\\nSince we've made the mistake of ordering an appetizer to share plus two entrees at other WDW restaurants and consequently being overwhelmed with the amount of food, we decided to play it safe with an appetizer each. This turned out to be the right amount of food. \\n\\nThe bread service was fine and came with sourdough, whole grain, and pretzel bread with maple syrup accented butter. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan (I prefer the bread at Yachstman and the butter at Kona), but overall it was okay. We had steak at Yachstman only a few days ago, so we went with the highly praised favorites of cheddar cheese soup and the Montreal poutine. The soup wasn't particularly special considering we were at a Signature restaurant. The flavor was overall bland and tasted more like a potato cheddar soup. The poutine had multiple chunks of brisket, but I found it much too salty to enjoy. The bits of cheese curds and gravy were good, but I decided that I liked the poutine from a kiosk at Disney Springs more than here. \\n\\nNow that our curiosity has been satisfied, I don't think we will be back on a return vacation to WDW but we appreciated the opportunity to visit Le Cellier."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"NOT RELIABLE - DO NOT ORDER AT THIS PLACE\\n\\nI ordered at this place on Uber eats.

We came here for brunch on a Friday afternoon and had a wonderful meal. I love that they serve breakfast & lunch items all day until 3 pm any day of the week, so if you want eggs benedict for  lunch on a Tuesday afternoon, that's totally possible!\\n\\nWe started off with the Mickey cappuccino, which is the only reason they're at 4 not 5 stars. This was honestly horrible. A small bit of espresso and milk, with a huge dollop of the worst excuse for foam I've ever seen on top of the cup-- honestly it looked like they frothed the milk using a blender or something, it had so many air bubbles and was not the typical light & silky foam that should be on top of a cappuccino. They sprinkled a ton of cinnamon on top in the shape of a Mickey (yes, very adorable), but this was just overall a horrible drink. It saddened me a bit to pay $5 for this two-sip disappointment.\\n\\nWhat this cafe lacks in quality espresso beverages, they do make up for in food however! We ordered the Mickey Waffle with bacon, and added the mandarin oranges, cranberries, & Chantilly cream toppings ($18.50 in all). We also ordered a lobster benedict and the benedict sampler. The mickey waffle was delicious as usual, and the topping were tasty additions & make for a cute picture if nothing else lol. Slather that guy in butter & syrup and you'll be fueled for a fun-filled day at Magic Kingdom! But if a Mickey waffle isn't your style, the benedicts are wonderful. The lobster benedict is $20 and the benedict sampler is $19, so you do the math. You're way better off getting three benedicts (in the sampler) for a dollar cheaper than you do the two lobster ones. Both benedict plates come with a nice little salad with a sweet dressing  on top.\\n\\nAll in all, the food is tasty here and the atmosphere is adorable.

Depending on what flavor you order, they're typically covered in either honey, nutella, or both and then sprinkled with sugar, cinnamon, and/or sea salt.

I will give them props for a good gravy, but the biscuits killed the gravy.  Don't know if it needed more gravy or a less of a biscuit, but it was a disappointment in the end.  On the other hand, the Salmon Hash was not to bad.  It had big chunks of salmon and was a hearty portion.  I would not get the house coffee.  They said it was their own special blend, but did not taste good at all.\\n\\nMaybe it was just us, but I really didn't see anything great about this place.  It probably had it's day and became to popular for it's own good.  Of course, usually when a popular restaurant goes downhill, it is more then likely the management in the end. \\n\\nI am not going to crucify this place, because maybe we just had a bad experience, but I cannot in good fair recommend it.

Had friends visiting from CA and on our tour of memory lane of my beloved Austin and from what I remember from my last visit to this spot 10 years ago - they had great views of the lake. I recall the food being meh, so was not surprised and I had set my guests expectations there. \\n\\nFirst, when you call ahead to ask for a party of 12, when is the best time to arrive... because they don't take reservations. The hostess said 7, so to be conservative we showed up at 6:30. Even then we were told it would be 45-60 for table outside. Ok, reasonable enough.  At the 1-hour mark, I went to  ask the hostess about the wait - she was incredibly rude and basically laughed at me for even asking. She even said it could be another hour! We should have left and this would be the end of the nightmare. But I didn't. We were sat at 8 pm at a table in front of fans that were so strong our sunglasses and me yes we're flying off the table - had to be hurricane level wind from their fan! Seriously the hostess struggled with putting stuff on the table. Thankfully they turned it off. \\n\\nThe waiter took more than 15 mins to great us and finally took our drink and app order. The queso arrived before drinks and chips! Ok, no biggie. We ordered by 8:30 pm. By 8:50 we started to ask about how much longer and could we at minimum get the kid food first. At 9:32 pm the first wave of food arrived... adults only! Nothing for the children who were beyond their breaking point. 9:45 part of the kids food arrive and 10 pm all the food had arrived. \\n\\nWe had to request twice for management to speak with us -- the guy that did bother to show up laughed at me. I was not amused. They said they would \\"take care of us\\" and gave us $125 off our meal. Ok, but when they charged my credit card it was a $30 adjustment ???? They then said they would adjust it for us and charged my credit card AGAIN for $32. They would not show me a receipt that refunded the $144 they already charged me. Needless to say there was N0 discount and I will make it my mission to see this place end. Wow! I have to say in my adult years this was the Worst. Place. Ever.

And this is the second incarnation of this place too.  Original being the one on Alexandra in Richmond.  \\n\\nI was super duper excited to see this second new location (it's the old Death by Chocolate across from Metrotown)   It's quite a respectable little corner of restaurants in that area now ! Cattle Cafe (HK Cafe / Noodle, bubble tea joint), a decent Japanese restaurant and and even more decent Taiwanese noodle place (Lao Shan Dong).\\n\\nThis second location is just as good as the original.  I don't stray from the noodle combos so I can't comment too much on the rest of the food.  But I really like the noodle combo's here - great value, great portions and they have a special noodle not on the menu.  It's not \\"vermicelli\\" in (don't be fooled by the menu), I only know it as \\"Mai Seen\\".  It's similar to \\"Lai Fun\\" - white, round, spaghetti-thickness, but a lot smoother.  Just point to the noodles that everyone else is getting, or attempt your Chinese - they will probably get it.  \\n\\nSo this is how it works, for $7.25 you get to pick your noodle (Mai Seen - say it with me), soup broth, and two toppings.  It includes a hot drink but I always upgrade to their awesome strawberry + blueberry slush for another $2.  It's delicious.\\n\\nAs for the soup broth, I actually really like the Tom Yum base - but for something more clear and traditional go for the Tomato & Pumpkin or Parsley & Century Egg.  The fish broth is \\"guaranteed no MSG\\" - which unfortunately makes it too bland for me!  Their chicken broth is good as well.  The laksa is pretty darn spicy, so it's not for me.  \\n\\nAs for the toppings, pick as you please - I always stick with the beef brisket and fish tofu.  It also always comes served with lettuce, a few slices of mushroom and puffy tofu as well.  \\n\\nThere is also a free covered parking lot - score!

We were pleasantly surprised by Eater/Instagram coverage that it was a juice bar. Impatient, I stopped in to explore the menu, and the woman behind the bar was super friendly and helpful in explaining all the drink iterations. She described the drinks as \\"mocktails,\\" which was accurate; I ordered a pineapple cream soda and every single action in forming it was very deliberate and routine, e.g., the pounding of mint leaves and addition of seltzer. I really appreciated the use of real pineapple (pith and all) and fresh cream, and the Middlesex setting made it feel like a old-school soda fountain with modern elements, in addition to a place for boba.

I'll start off by say the bread and oil is impeccable. We also ordered tomato soup that my wife thoroughly enjoyed. The Calamari, though slightly tough, paired well with the spicy tomato sauce it was served with.\\n\\nThere were a few unfortunate circumstances that lead to the 3 star review. Our server started off nice, but was either overworked or found his other tables to be more important than us. We personally found it off-putting when he sat the bill on the table before he acknowledged the fact that we had a third course coming. \\n\\nWe order two glasses of wine. We found the price to be extremely reasonable. I have a hard time reading the reviews that state the wine was overpriced. There was, however, a fallback on the execution. We found that either the glasses were dirty or cork ended up in the wine. On top of that, unfortunately we found hair in two separate dishes.\\n\\nMy wife wrote a review on another website. Fairly quickly I received a concerned phone call. Again, they truly care about their business. What left a sour taste in my mouth was the quasi-snotty response left on her review. It was not the owner that did that. From my findings, the owner is thoughtful in his response and seems to take the reviews seriously.

When you move to or visit Austin, Hopdoddy is very highly recommended by locals, a new and popular spot whose reputation somehow only keeps on growing. But even when I used to live less than a mile away, I still scurried past it and averted my gaze, deeply disturbed by the long lines stretching outside its doors, thinking to myself, who would be silly enough to accept waiting so long for such casual food? I silently thought of them as suckers.\\n\\nAnd so one stormy evening, I saw myself join that horde of suckers, waiting for over an hour, partly outside in heavy rain, then partly inside among a very crowded line, until I was finally at the register and it was my turn to order food.

But waiting in line an hour for them? No way. I would have walked away without any regrets if my friend hadn't insisted we ate there, and I will never find myself waiting in line again at Hopdoddy.

The banh mi came first - a balanced combination of sweet/savory pork, fresh herbs, pickled crunchy vegetables, and the much lauded baguette. Was it delicious? Yes. Was it life-changing like it's been described to me by every Buford Hwy foodie in Atlanta? Hard to say. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, it was an excellent banh mi - nothing in it was wrong, the baguette stood out for being crunchy without being hard enough to almost break a tooth (which has been a problem in some other restaurants). The pork wasn't overly sweet, the veggies were fresh and not limp from bad pickling, and the herbs weren't overpowering. The price of course, can't be argued with. I don't remember the last time I had something that good for less that $4. \\n\\nThe pho was unexpectedly delicious. I'd never heard much about it at Lee's, but the broth was perfect enough by itself without the addition of any sauce and I appreciate that they offer it as a combo option and don't make me pick banh mi over pho. \\n\\nTLDR: Great food, great prices, great location.

The cannoli shell was so fresh at Mikes I had traces of oil they fried the shell in on my fingers. Modern, Maria's and others will fill the shell (they did not make) in front of you to order, opposed to Mikes where the 18 varieties will come out already filled in trays.  There is a line around the corner for Mike's Pastry, if Mike's had to fill each cannoli upon order there would be a line back to the Zakim bridge.  So people take advantage of this and add shelf life to the cannolis when they were out for about 5 to 15 minutes as trays are constantly coming out to serve supply in demand.  One time I wanted a chocolate covered cannoli and the girl said wait a few minutes they are coming out, & they did in about 4 minutes, so they are being made continuously.  There are many cafe's and shops that sell pastry and they see a line whipped around Mikes Pastry extending into the other street and they are frustrated that Mike's is getting all the business. Stop the lies, and stop poisoning people minds that visit Boston!  Get the facts straight like I did that Mike's is the only place in Boston that hand makes their own shells.  They are the only shop that has 18 different cannolis with and extra pumpkin spice in the fall.  They are all good on the North End but Mike's is the King of the Cannoli.  This is not designed to take business away from anyone. There is no \\"who makes the best cannoli in Boston\\" because you would need more than one pastry shop to  actually make the cannoli opposed to filling packaged ones.  Mike's MAKES their cannoli by hand in house, other buy their shells in packages from vendors and simply fills them.  The shell at Mike's is MUCH softer because it is homemade in house, Modern had a hard crispy shell, not fresh.  Modern admits they buy their shells from the Golden Cannoli in Somerville MA, & the Golden Cannoli stated their shell can last 365 days frozen, so which place has the questionable shelf life?  The Food Network confirmed (you tube) that Mike's makes 5000-7000 shells a day, do the research."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Nice ambiance, french onion soup was the best I've ever had!

The ramen congee wasn't at all what I expected.  Rice instead on ramen noodles and the congee was rice, not porridge.

Usually I will have an order of the asian pockets--which are pan fried dumplings in a delicious tangy sauce.  Sometimes I will get what is called \\"King Moshi,\\" which is a king crab leg appetizer--reminiscent of spicy scallops, as the crab legs are steamed then baked again with a spicy cream sauce.  These are great--about just as good as anything you can put in your mouth.  The other good appetizer I like is the \\"trio tataki\\" which is 6 pieces of sashimi and kobe beef--which is a nice way to get that palate hungry for more.\\n\\nMy favorite roll here is the \\"J Mynt\\" roll.  It's just incredible.  While not actually sushi because it contains no sashimi, it's a delicious roll.  It has shrimp tempura, spicy crab salad (real crab), cream cheese, spicy peanut sauce and avocado.  This is always my \\"non sushi\\" sushi roll when I eat here.  It's really one of my favorite things in the world.  Another roll not to miss is the \\"Scarlet Craze\\" roll which is a tuna based roll with tuna tataki, toro and white tuna--this one is awesome as well.  They have a great rainbow roll as well.  Any sashimi you get will be perfect too.  Be sure to ask for a side of spicy \\"ponzu sauce\\" to dip your sushi/sashimi in--it makes all the difference and they have the best ponzu here.\\n\\nIf you don't want sushi they have very good regular food.  Their pad thai is as good as it gets (comes milder than most, so order spicy if you want spicy), their bento box is great (called Moshi Dinner Platter), and their Ginseng Braised Short Ribs (add lobster for $10 upcharge) are nothing short of to die for.\\n\\nChef David and the amazing staff here will stop at nothing to be sure your experience is the best.

He told me previously that he wanted sushi, so we decided to suprise him with a trip to Strip.  I had eaten here several times before and enjoyed their sushi, so what a great idea.  \\n\\nTaking into consideration that we were late for our reservation, I understand the hostesses reluctance to giving us a better table.  I understand that it was our fault for not being punctual (but we did call to advise them of our tardiness).  With that being said, we were seated at one of the  tables by the drafty window - it was 30 degrees outside - so we were freezing.  Of course, because we had been so late, if we would have changed seating, it would have been about an hour and a half wait since the restaurant was sooo crowded - okay no problem, we'll stay here.  The DJ was playing good music and there was alot of people watching going on, so it wasn't that bad.  At least we were seated.\\n\\nI forgot our waitresses name, she was really good with the menu.  She was knowledgeable about the wine list and allowed me to sample two of the ones I was interested in.  I still ended up getting something else, but she was very polite about it.  We ordered sushi for appetizers.  We had the Spicy Yellowtail Rolls, the Spider Rolls, and the Yummy (fried) Rolls.  Each of them were different and were sooo good.  \\n\\nWhen we ordered our main dishes, we had the Lemon Pepper Chicken, the Lobster Tail sliders, and the Baby Back Ribs.  The ribs were soooo good  and flavorful (yes i had a sample).  The Lemon Pepper Chicken was alright.  It was a full half of a chicken, so you had both the white and dark meat.  It just wasnt tooo flavorful to me, but it was alright at best (I should have gotten the Tandoori Salmon like I was thinking).  The Lobster Sliders - I don't know.  From what I was told, they were dry and the dish didn't come with any type of sauce, so when we asked for some, it took about 30 minutes for the food runner to come back.  The waitress hadn't even checked back with us to make sure our order was correct and then when we mentioned something to her, she was like \\"Oh, i wish i would have known that.\\"  Duh, you would have known that if you would have checked on us right after we got our food to see if we needed anything.  That was a little irritating.\\n\\nAnyway, since we had all that sushi, we ended up not even leaving a dent in the main dishes, so she bagged up our food for us and gave us the ticket.  We split the bill 2 ways since we were treating the birthday boy.  When I looked at the bill, she already included the 18% tip.  Now from what I know, the gratuity is normally added to parties of 5/6 or more; and I think everyone accepts that.  BUT, it was only 3 of us, why add the gratuity?  I have no idea, but I know she cut herself out of an extra 2% because I normally tip 20% on the total.  She got 18% on the gross.  Oh well.....not a total doozie.\\n\\nUltimately, I still like Strip - a little.  I would go back there, but maybe not for anything like a birthday celebration.

I ended up there on a Sunday afternoon, around 4:30 p.m., (mid-September) and they had a table for a party of 6.  How lucky was that?!  We also had a very attentive server, Xiao, who was super sweet and patient with a group of people all wanting separate checks.  Thanks, Xiao!\\n\\nAs for the food, I can only speak for two items.  One was the Chocolate Almond Bread with caramel salt butter.  This was divine.  It says \\"warm\\" on the menu, however, ours was not warm when served but still good.  I'm sure it would have been even more impressive had it actually have been \\"warm.\\"  Either way, you want this.\\n\\nThe other item I ordered was the Chicken Waldorf Salad.  This, I was not impressed with at all.  It was almost tasteless. The menu states it has grilled chicken breast, grapes, Granny Smith apples, sun dried cranberries (so, Craisens), celery, candied walnuts, shredded romaine, dijon vinaigrette and crunchy apple chips for $13.95.  Well, I barely had any chicken, I don't think there was any celery in the salad, I don't remember there being candied walnuts and the apple chips were anything but crunchy ... quite the opposite.  I suppose I should have just order what they are known for which was something chocolate/fatty ... however, I was actually trying to be a little healthy. Oh well.  So, consider this when eating at this particular establishment.\\n\\nAs for the restaurant itself, its cute.  As you probably know, its themed as Steampunk and there are folks who walk around as atmosphere entertainment.  So, that adds to the fun.  The place is clean and seemed to be running efficiently, just not with the temperature and taste of the regular food.  Again, I should have gotten a milkshake or something like that.  I would probably be giving them more stars if I had.\\n\\nEither way ... its a theme park restaurant.  Its great for families and chocolate lovers.  Who knows?  Maybe one day I'll give it another try ... just not for salads ... and I'll ask for warm bread next time."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Welp my fellow HCT fans I freaking finally made it here before the chicken ran out omg I'm so psyched.  Yup we stood in the long Sunday line hoping they wouldn't run out of chicken lol as we watched the board go down.  They didn't have the bone in bread of chicken as we would've had to wait ten to fifteen minutes for that so we both opted to get the boneless chicken breast.  My hubby ordered the warm and me in my Not so spicy self got cold.  We got the boneless chicken dinners that included the cole slaw and macaroni and cheese and two slices of bread and three garlic dill pickle slices and the boneless breast of chicken. I ordered my chicken as cold and my hubby got the warm. When they called out our name we got two boneless that was warm I was being brave so I dived into my warm chicken and after the first bite I'm thinking not so bad after second bite and hit my throat and taste buds yup I can't do this I'm a light weight so I tell them hey yeah I ordered cold but got warm.  They responded amazingly fast.  Yes I can handle cold lol loved it!  The mac and cheese was creamy and tasty loved it. The cole slaw was like my Mom makes with apple cider vinegar no over creaminess and it was spot on.

The appetizer seemed to be trying harder than they could execute, blueberries in crab cakes is not a thing...and even so they were mushy and lacked any crust that could salvage them. And so for the price point we felt very underwhelmed. THE only saving grace here was the entrees. I had the filet and the lamb chops, which both were spectacular and worth the pretty penny. Overall a let down. I think they need to de stodge the whole concept, fine tune the appetizers, and keep on with the entree and this place could be a solid winner night and night out.

When eating an hour before close, the service was incredible but the food had been sitting in the holding pans for a while and were over cooked. On the other hand, when dining here during their early bird, service suffered...in fact except for the initial seating she never voluntarily came to the table. However it was crowded so the turn over of fresh food was quick. It's your pick.\\n\\nTip: There are several items included with the buffet that are not actually put out. You have to ask for them and they will make them to order. I believe the items change but the lobster bisque and the sirloin are two of the items. Ask your server when you're seated.\\n\\nTip #2: Join their e-Club and receive discount coupons via e-mail before you arrive!"},{"name":"Euphoria","address":"8000 Fins Up Cir","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"First of all I'd like to thank Jessika for being such a great and friendly bartender.

The place has a vibe of Willy Wonka-esque wonder, just inviting you to step inside.\\nAs the lengthy name suggests, there is savory fare available, but let me level with you: This place exists for the sweets.\\nUpon entering, the first thing you see (aside from the line of eager guests) is the gift shop. Worth the visit in itself, Toothsome's gift shop is every bit as magical as it's neighbor, Honeydukes. Artfully crafted cupcakes, embellished macarons, Adorable mini Pie Lollipops, and obviously every iteration of chocolate are displayed exquisitely throughout the shop. \\nThe decorations are all classic steampunk, which meshes surprisingly well with the confections. \\nStaff are all wearing their steampunk finest: Lace, Gears, Corsets over poofy blouses, Top Hats, etc.\\nIn our first night in Orlando, we decided to eat dinner here. I'm a big research person, and upon studying the menu weeks beforehand, I decided to convince my friend we should split an entree to save room for milkshakes. \\nWe landed on the Teriyaki Burger. It came with a cylindrical basket of steak fries as well. It was all pretty good, but we unfortunately weren't wowed by the savory fare. It seemed like standard 'Pub Grub with a Twist'.\\nThe milkshakes, on the other hand, were standouts. She got the Chocolate X5, which was quite elegant in presentation. I got the Marshmallow Crisp; Blended with Marshmallow Fluff and topped with a Rice Krispie treat, this shake was a knockout. If that weren't enough, I ordered a shot of Jim Beam to mix in (because hard milkshakes are absolutely one of my favorite desserts in the world)!\\nFinal thoughts: We didn't try much of the savory side of things, but we did return 4 times in 3 days for sweets!

It's developed quite the Yelp reputation it appears.  I went there twice for lunch within a span of a few weeks recently.  First off, let me preface this post with stating the fact that I am vegetarian, so I'm solely basing this place on its vegetarian offerings.  The best thing about the bahn-mi sandwiches here has to be the price.  I think it's $2.50 for a 6-7 inch vegetarian tofu sandwich (which comes with Vietnamese mayo, tofu, cilantro, jalapeno, bean sprouts, and a few other ingredients).  It's a solid sandwich.  I didn't find it to be all that filling though, but it was tasty.  However, I wasn't a big fan of the bread which a lot of folks have raved about.  It was a little tough for my taste.  However, the sandwich was good and the affordable price makes it that much more an attractive item.  On my 2nd visit there, I ordered the Pho-Sandwich special (half a pho noodle soup/half a sandwich for under $7).  The sandwich was consistent with what I had previously, but the Pho didn't really hit the spot as I had expected.  It was a vegetarian Pho with tofu, but it lacked flavor.  Even drenching it in soy and Sriracha didn't seem to spruce up the bland flavor of the soup.  I won't hold that completely against them though because other Pho joints on Buford Highway that I've tried have failed similarly.  I guess it's hard to infuse any discernible flavor without beef broth, so, I won't knock them too much for that.  The sandwich nor Pho soup blew me away, so I think 3-stars is a sufficient rating, especially from a vegetarian's perspective.  Definitely worth checking out tough, especially if you've never had a Bahn-Mi before."},{"name":"Austin's Pizza South Lamar","address":"1817 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I ordered a California pizza in a 10\\" size with vegan cheese.

I think the website said 45 to 55 minutes, but does the timer start once I get the email, or as soon as the order was submitted? Other pizza places have better tracking, reducing my stress level.

I have to say that it actually was sad ! I was / we were very disappointed that perhaps we got the short end of the stick . The meat was flavorless , the rice was O.k I mean I wish it had a bit more salt to bring out what ever other flavor it would of had, the beans as well I couldn't get not even an onion taste, I mean do not get me wrong I can tell the ingredients were fresh I just wish that I had more FLAVOR packed into it. I thought maybe the salsa would have given it a taste , but I guess I needed to unwrap it before taking it home and place the salsa in.

Well aside from the entertainment which I would give a 3-4, the actual food and drinks itself I would give a 2. So I figured Senor Frogs wouldn't be the most authentic Mexican restaurant however I did assume for the high prices that the food would be tasty - wrong!  An appetizer of chips and salsa is literally $8! Are you kidding me?! Now if it was this amazing house made chips and salsa then maybe it would be a different story.  Forewarning: the drinks will make you feel like absolute sh** the next day. Aside from the fact that they are ridiculously overpriced -- a pint is $9 I believe and the souvenir yard you can take home is around $21? Lets break their drinks down.... they are filled to the brim with crushed ice and consists more of various sugar syrups as opposed to any alcohol. So save yourself the money, if you really want a souvenir cup go to a craft store and get yourself one and decorate it for cheaper. Now the food, my husband and I ordered the fish tacos. When we got them the fish tasted so horrible that neither of us could actually swallow one whole bite. There was no way we were taking it home. Now the karaoke and dancing was fun!

Well the next day, me being the researcher I am, I look into Cancun Cards -- which is the gift card we had received. Let me tell you, I am SO thankful I did that research. This is basically a complete scam. The actual package itself cost around $169. However, they tell you it is free for you when you have to pay a $59 activation fee, pay for your flight there, pay for your food, and spend one whole day learning about their time shares. So they basically are trying to get you to buy their time shares. So we would've ultimately spent a couple thousand dollars on something that was supposed to be FREE! \\n\\nSooooo am I surprised that this happened at Senor Frogs?

I've hit this truck five times now and here is my honest review. \\n\\nFirst off, they serve a proper taco. Double corn tortilla, meat, cilantro and onions with complimentary salsa. That is the definition of a Chicago street taco. Now if you are going to go full on Mexican street taco, then you are just talking meat and salsa. So please, any review that harps about the lack of lettuce or tomato, or Gods forbid- sour cream! Please educate yourself about tacos and do the world a favor by deleting your review.\\n\\nNow the tortilla is an El Milagro corn tortilla. Just like you will find in Chicago. This fact brought a tear to my eye with my first bite. I immediately could taste the fact that they are serving a superior tortilla.\\n\\nI have tried the steak, chorizo and pork tacos. The steak are my favorite. There has been one visit where the steak was dry, but other than that one anomaly, the steak is pretty tasty. Now the chorizo is super salty, like chorizo should be. I wouldn't mind cutting the bite of the mexican sausage with some cheese. I know that is a bit gringo of me, but I think it would taste heavenly. I can't say I'm a big fan of the pineapple in the pork, but hey, to each his own. \\n\\nThe quesadillas are small yet amazing. Perfect for the little ones.\\n\\nNow the salsas are easily superior to anything your will find in Florida. This is where Mazatlan knocks it out of the park. The salsa has intense flavor. Both the green and red are fantastic. I could drink the stuff from a milk jug if I could. Best of all it is free! Black Rooster could learn a thing or two from this place.\\n\\nNow I will admit the tacos are on the pricey side. Three tacos and a coke are going to run you about 14$. I'm willing to pay the price for a slice of home. I do wish the kid at the window had a bit more spark or personality.\\n\\nAll in all Tacos Mazatlan makes the world a better place. I wish them good fortune."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I had to go here because I love those tiny donuts and I've never seen them filled with a center.

It was a tale of 2 separate visits both in the same day.  \\n\\nThe first tale - When we arrived at around 5pm we had 2.5 hours before our reservation which was a VIP experience.  We grabbed seats by the bar and proceeded to wait about 25 minutes and not a single server stopped despite our trying to get someone's attention several times.  One of our party finally got up and spoke to a staff member at the bar and they came over without explanation or apology and took our drink order.  He returned about 15 minutes later and one of the 4 drinks (a margarita) was completely tasteless so we asked to replace it with a beer.  Another 15 minutes passed and the beer arrived.  We ordered a second round of drinks commenting that it seemed to be taking a really long time and the waiter just laughed about it.  We ordered food shortly after which took less time to arrive and was good quality.  Once again we had to wait another 10 or so minutes just to track down our waiter to pay and he neither acknowledged nor thanked us after settling the bills.  Mind you, this was on a Sunday evening and it was not even that busy by the time we got there.  \\n\\nThe second tale - We checked in for the VIP experience and were promptly taken to our area.  Our host, Connor, commented that we were his first VIP experience and I'm pleased to say that he did a FANTASTIC job.  Friendly, engaging, checked on us frequently, and really went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed ourselves.  If he had not said anything I would have easily assumed he was a veteran at the role.  For 2 of us (myself included) this was our first experience with Topgolf.  We had a great time!  The different games were a lot of fun and I was very impressed with both the technology as well as how well heated the area was and fairly well protected from heavy rain.  Overall we forgot about the initial experience by the time we had left given how fun and professional the VIP experience went.  \\n\\nI pondered how to rate this experience for a while.  I am giving 3 stars because of the massive disparity between the bar/food service and the VIP experience.  A solid 5 stars for Connor and the VIP treatment, but barely 2 stars for what was extremely subpar service and treatment from the bar/food service.  We would definitely go back for the golfing part in the future."},{"name":"Waterloo Ice House Southpark Meadows","address":"9600 S Ih 35 Frontage Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"McKenzie the bartender was wonderful.

Got one taco, and a bunch of different empanadas. So, the taco was delicious - expensive for one taco, but it was a pretty large taco, with a fluffy, fresh-made tortilla, a pile of fantastically delicious shredded beef, a ton of cheese, and an entire avocado. On the other hand, funny enough, the empanadas I was actually here for, which were most of our purchase, I was not impressed with at *all*. I'm used to empanada dough being sort of crispy/flaky, not too dense, and mainly there to support the fillings. Here, the fillings were decent enough, but the dough was deep-fried to kingdom come, dense as frack, and just not very enjoyable to eat. Too bad for us, since we bought several of them. I guess it's just a different style of empanada than the style we're used to?

When I wasn't ready to tackle a large meal, I'd go for the corned beef hash, which was excellent and would also re-heat well as leftovers.\\n\\nThe new place, sadly, feels far more like a TGI Fridays than its roots as a diner.

The buffet is the usual suspects, just worse and more stale.  The corned beef hash in huge trays, lukewarm and mushy, makes me weep for what this place used to be.\\n\\nIt's still about 10x better than IHoP, but that's not saying much.

Starting with condiments. As a sauce and dips gal, HP was a staple for using fries as a vessel to shamelessly fill up on their three specialty condiments: Chipotle ketchup, bbq ketchup, honey mustard. Good god, the new \\"caffeinated bbq\\" was the least appetizing watery consistency. Twice as sugarly and ten times nastier than any bbq I've ever tasted. Just why?\\n\\nI'll mention the service briefly. While our wait staff was perfectly fine, the young woman taking our order in the line was an eye rolling nightmare. I've worked in restaurants and there's simply no reason to unleash frustration upon perfectly mundane interaction with a customer. \\n\\nThe truffle fries were over seasoned and under truffled. Not sure what happened to that flavor, but it's gone. Be prepared to guzzle water for eternity. Pretty sure they used up all the salt in the dead sea to season the fries. \\n\\nHonestly the nastiest thing about the whole meal we're the salad dressings. Apparently vinaigrettes are no longer and option, but instead you can have fatty cream dressing, fatty cream dressing, or fatty cream dressing. Ranch (oh I'm sorry did I accidentally walk into Chili's?), \\"Ceasar\\" aka ranch with vaguely more lemon flavor, and horseradish aka Satan's celery butthole. That thing will probably haunt my taste buds for the foreseeable future.  \\n\\nBurger wasn't really anything to rave about anymore. HP typically represents quality local ingredients, but the sad watery pale tomato tells me that foundation has crumbled.

Ya burnt!)\\n\\nFrom the moment I stepped up to this rinky-dink looking pop-up I fell in love. I don't even (normally) eat meat (spoiler alert, I did here), but I knew I was just in love. I look at the menu and see that mac and cheese and coleslaw are pretty much my only options as a non-meat-eater, but I'm not really in to coleslaw so I decide to order up a small bin of mac and cheese (which was actually more than a meal's worth, IMO) when I look up at the cashier and see possibly the most refreshingly beautiful, smiling woman you will ever see in your life, and her beauty is only magnified by my hunger for that fried chicken she's slinging. \\n\\nTurns out, this woman is Lisa and she and her (also ridiculously good-looking) husband own and run Hot Chicken Takeover. I love it. Two young, gorgeous kids meet, fall in love, get married, and make beautiful hot fried chicken at a corner-stand in Columbus, Ohio for the betterment of the world. It's basically the greatest love story ever told. \\n\\nAnyway, my food comes out and it's got my name written on the box in just the most perfect penmanship which might seem like nothing to most people but it's not to me because I never told them my name. So that means that lovely Lisa took the time to peep my name off my form of payment and then to write it out with such love (no scribbling here) on my future box of mac and cheese, so handsome Joe could call it out and come running with it to my table and for whatever reason that really resonated with me. It was personal in a way that you wouldn't expect fast food fried chicken to be, and that's a good thing. \\n\\nSo then I find myself sitting at a pop-up tent-covered picnic bench with my friends and a community of strangers from all walks of life surrounding me, all devouring what looks and smells like the most heavenly, crispy, crunchy, fried chicken breasts you've ever laid eyes on and I break. I decide that after 8 consecutive years of not eating meat that I deserve a 10-minute time-out to eat up some of this hot ass chicken. I ask my friend if I can nibble on some of his skin, which only sounds disgusting out of context, but believe me- in actuality it was a beautiful thing. \\n\\nSo spicy, so flavorful, that texture -- just absolutely, without a doubt, undeniably the food of the gods. I have no regrets about breaking on my near-decade-long vegetarian voyage.

Master G doesn't sell coffee, he KICKS COFFEE'S BUTT.\\n2. Master G put nunchucks on the wall of his shop because he is so strong he doesn't need weapons to KICK YOUR BUTT.\\n3. Master G's coffee doesn't burn him because his hands are made of steel. It doesn't burn mere mortals' hands by spilling out the top of the cup (thanks to a cool lid that has a sliding-open thingy), it burns them by being in a cup that's too thin. It KICKS your hands, then KICKS YOUR BUTT.\\n4. Chuck Norris wishes he could own a coffee shop just like Master G. Master G put a poster of Chuck Norris up to make Chuck Norris feel better, but the only thing that will make Master G happy is to KICK Chuck Norris' BUTT. \\n5. When Master G sells coffee for $2.90, you only have to pay $2.11, but his secret coffee ninjas won't tell you until they've already rung you up. A confused customer is a customer open for a BUTT KICKING.\\n6. Master G's mind control is so powerful, he can convince unfriendly baristas to wear stupid kung fu uniforms while serving coffee. If they didn't wear them, he'd KICK THEIR BUTTS.\\n7. Master G drinks his coffee while sitting erect. He never reclines, and you won't either when you're in his shop that's the opposite of cozy.

Broth is extremely flavorful and they pack their pho with meat and noodles! First time, I got the pho with us and the meat to noodle ratio was a bit off (too little meat). This time I got the oxtail pho and the meat ratio was perfect, but the oxtail was not fall of the bone. Still, the broth and other rare beef was worth it! Next time, I'd go for the meat lovers pho.

Still, I am only slightly embarrassed that I am a sucker for this place. I am a white vegetarian from Los Angeles and I know Mexican food and this definitely isn't it. But I must say, the nachos here, which can be made vegetarian with black beans, are better than any I have had. It's a not at all gigantic serving when you look at it, but maybe one doesn't require nachos to always arrive in a heap. This plate, though, is a must-order and perfect with guacamole, jalapenos, cheese and the like and really it's just the right size for one or two people. So, there's that. The cocktails at Superica are much more fantastical than you will find in your normal margarita joint. There is a real hipster mixologist behind the bar and he knows what he is doing. Otherwise, naturally, the menu doesn't have an enormous amount of options for vegetarians, but the Ensalada De La Casa with chopped greens, queso fresco, radishes, cucumbers, etc., is quite glorious. They have Negro Modelo on tap for $4. The multicultural (black & white) waitstaff is obviously encouraged to be very friendly to patrons a la Trader Joes and because they are mostly youngsters it comes off as awkward and forced. That sort of thing works in a diner when it's authentic, but here it makes patrons giggle.

I made reservations for myself and my 9 year old son, a couple of months in advance, and I was very much looking forward to eating here on this special day.  \\n\\nArrived about 30 minutes before our reserved time and we were seated within 5 minutes, well before our reserved time.  Our waiter was Todd, and he came by almost immediately and said he would be right back to take our drink orders.  He quickly returned and took our drink orders, and we were ready to order everything, so we also gave him our dinner orders.  We ordered unsweetened tea, Arnold Palmer with unsweetened tea, blood orange margarita, two strip steaks (one medium and the other medium well), one \\"seasonal soup\\" (broccoli cheddar).\\n\\nTodd, shortly brought the tea and the Arnold Palmer to the table.  Shortly afterwards, a young lady (her name tag read she was from \\"Roswell Georgia\\") who was the hostess when we checked in, brought butter and a basket of bread to the table.  Shortly afterwards the soup arrived.  \\n\\nSometimes during this time, a young couple, about Todd's age, was seated behind us and it was obvious from the conversation, that was overheard between them that they all knew one another.  Basically gossip talk and animated talk and Todd kneeling down by their table for extended periods of time.  \\n\\nI finished my soup.  Todd came by and I told him I never received my margarita and I no longer wanted it.  I told him I would now rather just get a beer to go along with my steak.  Ordered a Yuengling lager.\\n\\nSteaks were delivered to the table by someone other than Todd.  Todd continued to make frequent visits to table behind me to casually chat with them.    We were not given steak knives.  The medium well steak was my son's and it was without a doubt one of the worse steaks I have ever seen served.  I did my best to cut his steak for him with a dull butter knife.  It was over over over cooked (at least extra well done) and very tough.  There was no way you could even swallow it because it was so dry and tough. I would challenge anyone to eat more then 2 bites.  Todd finally showed up and I told him about the problem with the medium-well steak.  I gave my son the medium steak and he went to work on it with the butter knife.  It had a load of gristle,  but at least the non-gristle portions were moist and semi tender and were edible.  I asked Todd for some steak knives and he went off to redo the medium-well steak, but we decided on medium for the remake.  Also asked him for the \\"house made steak sauce\\" that was boastfully listed in the description of the steak on the menu, yet we never got any or was not questioned if we needed any sauce. Shortly afterwards the remade steak was brought to table.  No steak knives, no steak sauce, no tea refills (both glasses had been empty for a while and we had not gotten a single refill yet).  Then there was Todd kneeling on the floor at the table behind us talking it up.  I turned in my chair and looked at him until he stood and then approached our table.  Told him I needed a steak knife (for the third time), steak sauce for the second time and tea refills.  He shuffled away.  Somebody else left us a single steak knife off at the table.  Someone else brought one small ramekin of sauce for our two steaks we ordered.  The remade steak was medium-raw, at best.  A lot of bloody fluid filled the plate as I cut it into pieces.  I ate the parts that were less raw and that were not gristle.\\n\\nThat's about it.  Ordered the chocolate fondue for desert and my son liked that.  Was not offered any kind of resolution for our horrible meal and the horrible service.  The dinner check had the 15% and the 20% tips calculated and printed at the bottom of the check/receipt.  I wrote in \\"10%\\" underneath, calculated it and that is what I tipped Todd.  \\n\\nAs we were exiting the restaurant and passing the hostess stand I asked a lady standing there if she was a manager.  She responded \\"I'm a coordinator\\", or something to that effect and asked if she could help me.  I conveyed to her quickly, quietly, and politely my complaints.  She said she would check into it and make adjustments to my account if need be.   I have seen no response as of yet.  \\n\\nWorst Disney experience EVER for me.  I expected so much better at the crown jewel of The Disney World Resorts.  I tried to use it as a learning experience for my 9 year old son.

One in walking distance to my home?? The theater experience however does not compare to the Icon in Seaport. If you're going to build a BRAND NEW theater here's what you should do:\\n- install comfortable seats. No brainer. Did anyone test these seats? I feel like I have to hold my head up because the head rest is so far back, which makes for a very uncomfortable experience. There are also not recliner seats throughout, so if you want your legs elevated, be prepared to be in the front quarter of the theater. Don't get too excited here though, the recliners elevate your legs to maybe a 45deg angle and they maybe go halfway down your calf. The seats are also pretty narrow, so you may feel pretty close to that stranger next to you. Best theater seats I've ever sat in are typically at a cinema delux, amc has decent seats. Icon in seaport has very comfy seats, but don't recline enough either.\\n- 4K laser projection; standard projection pales in comparison and the difference is STUNNING.

The initial greeting upon walking into the restaurant was good, but the server initially seemed too busy for us.  He slowly began to open up more and joke and talk with us.  The drinks were divine - $20 champagne was heavenly but I can not remember the name of the company who makes it for anything and they also made a couple of very delicious dirty martini with stoli for my SO.  I used a travel voucher deal so our 4 course meal included braised beef tenderloin which was perfect, my spouse had diver scallops which they enjoyed while I had one of the best lamb belly dishes I have ever tasted.  For our main course I selected the medium rare herb crusted pork chops and although I have never ordered any meat rare it was heavenly while my SO order the seared halibut and loved it.  Heading into the dessert portion we were stuffed but I ordered the grand marnier souflee and it was just ok to me but I am not a dessert girl while my spouse order the meyer lemon banana pudding and loved it.  It was our anniversary so the restaurant gave us a vanilla cheesecake which was very nice and tasty.

I'm a big fan of Clover and was really excited when I learned about the Burlington location after moving from the city to the 'burbs. \\n\\nUnfortunately, life, health and chronic diagnoses are currently precluding me from eating any gluten - multiple doctor's orders. When I arrived at Clover BUR around 11 AM last Tuesday, my first question to the staff member, who greeted us as we entered was, \\"I'm wondering what platter items you have that are gluten free?\\"\\n\\nThe gentleman spent some time on the app looking up allergen info, which I greatly appreciated and told him so. He suggested the Egg and Eggplant Platter. I reiterated to him I was gluten free per doctor's orders and that I am also dairy free. \\n\\nTo save the review from being too TMI, I'll just gloss over it: I had some symptoms upon returning home, but did not directly connect it to the food I just ate. \\n\\nI was considering going back to Clover for more treats and found the section on the app where I can view all the dishes and their allergen info to see what else I could have. I noticed that one of the sides they added to my platter explicitly contained wheat and dairy, which I did not know at the time of consuming it or else I would have not consumed it. It wasn't cross-contamination, which the server informed me was a possibility, but the side was explicitly wheat and dairy based.\\n\\nI'm not sure if there was some miscommunication to the staff, and I know that sides change daily based on availability and what makes sense for the dish, but I had figured me informing the staff member that I was on doctor's orders to be gluten free and also do not consume dairy would have effectively 86'd this as an option on my plate.\\n\\nI emailed customer service (super nicely and laden with compliments, I was Clover4life) on the 27th to let them know of the snafu and hoped to receive a response confirming that the staff would at least be informed of the mix-up or a simple apology, but never heard back, much to my dismay. \\n\\nMy fiance was pretty freaked out when I told him about the whole thing - he watched me have a two minute conversation with the staff member about gluten and dairy free options on the menu. \\n\\nI'm hoping Clover takes extra steps and opportunities to go over avoiding further mistakes like this in the future. I went through ServSafe Allergen Awareness Training myself and became certified - it's pretty straightforward, but mistakes can be made.\\n\\nETA: I received a fully apologetic response from the manager at CloverBUR after posting this review and was assured that the staff will be re-trained on allergen awareness, so I have updated the stars to reflect that on my own accord. I really appreciated them reaching out and look forward to visiting this location again as I've been assured they are committing to re-training the staff on allergen awareness and even have a new gluten free breakfast bowl in the works.

The Garlic Knots were highly recommended by our server so we were convinced to get a few. The knots were crisp on the outside and densely doughy and starchy on the inside. A thick layer of flavorful garlic and pecorino cheese sat on top of each knot and was paired with a lightly sweet marinara sauce. The Kbar Pizza was delicious with gooey mozzarella, fennel spiced Italian sausage, tender mushrooms, and flavorful garlic on a soft thin crust. Finally, we couldn't leave without trying the Nutella Cannoli. Sweet creamy Nutella infused filling was filled with chocolate chips and crunchy almonds and sat inside a crispy cannoli shell.

Our server was so friendly & helpful. My wife & I were only there to just grab a snack & drinks after walking the belt line & she surprised us with more than what we ordered. She also gave us these free samples of their frito bags. Basically, frito chips, cheese, sour cream, & their season beef. It was simple, but so good. She explained to us the reason they created this & how it goes along with Tex-Mex. \\n\\nFood & Drinks: \\nChips & Guac - It was soo good! I recommend squeezing the lime in the guac to add extra flavor. I loved the type of chips they served. It wasn't like chips you get in a bag, but actually fried chips that are in made. Not too hard, but a great in between. \\n\\nFrozen Margarita - I loved this as well. It was such a great balance of alcohol & sweetness. I don't enjoy having too much alcohol where that is all you can taste, but not overly sweet. I also love anything that's frozen like that, especially on a hot day. \\n\\nFrito Bags (?) - Not 100% sure if they are called that, maybe it's pies? Anyways, i LOVED how simple this was, yet sooo good! As i mentioned above it contains Fritos, cheese, sour cream, & season beef. My wife doesn't eat meat frequently, and they did have the option to remove the beef, but she tried it & was so impressed with how good it is. Sometimes the simple things are the best things!!\\n\\nVibe: \\nLoved the vibe of this place. I would describe it as laid back & casual. The staff definitely adds to the vibe. We met & talked to a few of the servers. I was quite impressed with how friendly & genuine they were.

I shared some guacamole with a friend and it was ok but not great and the multi color tortilla chips it came with were stale and gross. I had three margaritas and they had little to no alcohol in them (margaritas usually hit me kind of hard) and at $9 each that's a huge problem. The service was ok.

It was a Friday evening, about 7PM, and found that the parking lot for this, and the Hooters next door, were blocked with signs announcing that there was a charge for parking. Did I mention the coupon? Well, that should tell you that I'm not paying for parking. We did find a lot without attendants, and walked to the restaurant, past the Hooter's. \\n\\nUpon entering, my middle aged ears were assaulted by a very loud PA system with someone playing a trivia game of some sort.

Definitely wasn't sanitary at all. \\n\\nAll that aside: I was super excited to try their desserts! They had very attractive looking sweets. My friends and I bought 4 different kinds of milkshakes. \\nI was sorely disappointed when I tasted my Hazelnut milkshake. It was almost straight COOLWHIP. Not much of a hazelnut flavor at all. I then tasted my friend's Red Velvet Milkshake only to find that it also tasted solely of cool whip with chunks of red velvet cupcake. The cupcake on top was your Joe Shmoe red velvet cupcake. \\nThe vanilla milkshake was alright. No prominent vanilla flavor, also mostly tasted of cool whip. The macaroon on top was alright. My 13 year old sister makes better. \\nNow the key lime pie milkshake: while the milkshake itself was not surprisingly liquid cool whip, the slice of key lime pie on top of the shake was amazing. It wasn't too tangy wasn't too sweet. It was a perfect balance. The lime flavor was subtle and gentle. Really stinking good!\\n\\nThe chocolate creme br√ªl√©e was very nice. It didn't have an overwhelming chocolate flavor, it was surprisingly light. Very good stuff!\\n\\nThe chocolate mousse was insanely heavy. Mousse is supposed to be a very airy and fluffy dessert.

It was alright. \\n\\nNOW FOR THE ENTREES. \\n\\nThe Chicken Bourguignon was very interesting. The sauce was delicious, exactly how a red wine mushroom sauce should taste, absolutely delicious. The chicken was a bit over cooked, very dry. The mashed potatoes weren't seasoned! Boo! There wasn't any salt or pepper on the table to save you either. \\n\\nThe Teriyaki Salmon was cooked PERFECTLY and was well seasoned!

Actually more busy than I thought at 7pm and found a spot at the bar. Wine list pretty solid for Italian and about 10-12 by the glass for $15 or less but about half under $10. Full bar and some beer available as well. \\n\\nWe had the polenta (needed up getting both the side and appetizer by accident), the cacio e pepe, and the spaghetti carbonara. First off, the bean dip with the bread was fantastic and should be packaged and solid. Bread was thin and not much going on but solid enough to soup up the great dip that's almost an Italian hummus. Both polentas were fantastic. Fist, the $6 portion was a corn meal with a poached egg that I could eat for days in spoonfuls. Tater like a mashed potato with a slight corn background. The mushroom polenta was also a very filling dish. Polenta was a bit deep fried and the cheese base was so strong but stuck to the polenta perfectly. Some mushrooms but come to this dish for the polenta and cheese sauce. For entree, even though full, we still finished off both pastas. Neither was too memorable and honestly looked the same except for a few pieces of ham and egg on the carbonara. For $30 the carbonara was a rip off. Pasta was fine and super creamy and flavorful but that's what butter and cheese makes. The pepe is the way to go if you're craving a white sauce pasta and can even get half portion which is plenty with some apps. Overall I'd say this a fine homely meal for Italian. Appetizers exceeded and pasta and fine in terms of expectations. But this place is always crowded and don't take reservations so glad I came and would be back if the time and place fit. No TV or WiFi so I'd say this place is for eating and dining and talking and not for the business man or solo diner."},{"name":"Old Thousand","address":"1000 E 11th St, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I never leave feedbacks but this deserves it.

I was excited to find what seemed to be a charming little Mexican place really close to home, so we checked it out last night.  Its a small little heritage home, with 6 double tables in the main room, and 3-4 tables in another room, and a home-style kitchen.  Reso's are recommended for bigger tables, and be patient with the turnaround time on food because its 3 people in a tiny kitchen.  \\n\\nFirst comment I have on the service: its a small place, so I know its hard to justify paying for another server to help.  But there was only 1 guy (owner?) who seemed to be taking all the orders, serving, getting drinks, seating people, etc - pretty much taking care of everything that wasn't involved with cooking, making drinks, or taking payment.  He admitted he forgot about us after waiting about 20 minutes to order.  Anyhow, the rating had more to do with the disappointment in the food we had.  \\n\\nWe shared a number of things: Quesido Fondido (baked cheese & chorizo, and with corn tortillas and toppings on the side), taco soup, 2 tacos, and the enmolada.  All the corn tortillas served that night were stale and hard - we could literally snap it.  Preparing a proper tortilla shell should be pretty basic for a Mexian restaurant, right? So it was pretty unpleasant trying to eat everything when you have the tortilla digging into your mouth.  The pulled pork on my taco was good, my friend's fish was shredded, not quite a tasty taco either.  This was also my first time trying taco soup, so I wasn't too sure what to expect in terms of taste. I liked the taco / cheese / avocado in there, but as for the soup itself, it tasted like a basic tomato soup.  I felt like everything sounded a lot better than it tasted.  The stuff we ate wasn't horrible or anything, but there wasn't anything really memorable about it.  \\n\\nAnyhow, I did like the fact that they sell lots of Mexican goods at the coffee bar, with chips, tortilla shells, candies, drink mixes, etc.  I always want to see small local shops like this do well, so I think I could probably give it a second chance, but there are lots of things that need to be improved on."},{"name":"Ken's NY Deli & Brick Oven Pizzeria","address":"72 Great Rd","city":"Bedford","stars":"3.5","text":"After my first visit right after they opened I had my doubts because they really didn't have their act together but since then I've been in several times and each time the service was great and the food was superior.

I didn't try the beef empanada but, Erica said it was throwing her off with the powdered sugar on it so, I would order it without it and it would probably be pretty good.  The soup I had definitely needed to be doctored up at the table with salt and pepper but, the broth was pretty meat hearty and the rice wasn't overly mooshy.  I would recommend the soup which had a meat ball and 1 potato in it as garnish.\\n\\nThe shredded chicken was moist however, I didn't taste a whole lot of Parmesan in the cream sauce; it was more citrusy from lemon than anything.  I was surprised by the kalamata olive (be careful there is a pit in it) and the hard boiled egg slice.  I have never had Peruvian cuisine but, I am sure this is an ethnic custom and it was actually tasty; just wish there was more than one of each.  The rice made a nice addition to eat up the rest of the sauce but, it could have been a larger portion.\\n\\nFor the price though, you can't beat it and I will definitely be back to sample some more items.  I also saw a projector on the ceiling so, they must do some sports viewing or something there."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"672 S Gaines St, Ste 2","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The Donut King!\\n\\nIf you're in Portland, you've probably heard about VooDoo Donuts.

I was recommended to check out this buffet by the staff at the hotel I was staying at during my vacation.  Boston Lobster Feast is a little on the pricey side for a buffet but does offer an early bird discount if you arrive within the first two hours of it opening for dinner (which I did).  The restaurant was already crowded by the time I arrived at 4:45 PM.  \\n\\nThe buffet is a true seafood smorgasbord, complete with clams, oysters, steamer clams, crab legs, and above all, lobster.  The house rule is that your are allowed only one lobster per trip to the buffet.  The lobsters are on the small end, about 1 lb. apiece, and do lean on the overcooked side.  There is also prime rib at the carving table but I preferred the London Broil at the self service end instead.  The other offerings are quite good: the oysters are fresh, the steamer clams are perfect (there is a proper way to eat them, or else they will taste very gritty!). The soups are fresh, and very rich.  There is a wonderful dessert bar with ice cream, cheesecakes, and flan.  Overall, most of the offerings are good and there was not any item I did not care for.\\n\\nI was seated quickly and received excellent service from the waitstaff, who made sure empty seafood shells are cleared and drinks refilled (they serve Pepsi products).  The manager did \\"management by walking around\\" and made sure everyone was satisfied.\\n\\nIt may be awhile before I get to return to the area, but I'm sure to come back again!"},{"name":"Bits & Bites Cafe","address":"912 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"Not sure why this place isn't receiving more love. Their delivery charge ($1) is the most humble in Waltham, their drivers are always quick and sociable, and the food has always been deliciously consistent.\\n\\nTheir Heath Bar Banana smoothie taste like the nectar of the gods sprinkled with crack. If you don't want to slurp down your dessert with a straw, their frozen yogurt is a pint of Ben and Jerry's, minus the stupid hippie. Previous poster Lauren F. complained that she received \\"too much\\" ice cream. What sort of delusional plain of existence do you occupy that too much ice cream is a bad thing? Must be the same one that Matty B. from Waltham lives on where he feels he can be critical of his \\"sandwhich\\", yet can't spell the meal he's reviewing. So her \\"complaint\\" is completely valid and they don't skimp on your toppings either. Pound for pound best place for Froyo delivery in Waltham.\\n\\nThe pizza is the thinnest of crusts in Waltham. Being such, it congeals and hardens in your fridge and doesn't make decent leftovers. That's not to say it's made of cheap ingredients, but it doesn't maintain the consistency of most cold slices you crawl out of bed for in the middle of the night because it's paper thin. But when it arrives hot and gooey (and it will, because their delivery guys are awesome), you'd be hard-pressed to not place it among the top five places in Waltham for a pie, the peers of which being: Lena's, Franco's, Pini's, Athens, and Tara's. It's just a pitfall to the style really and is certainly not a criminal offense worthy of robbing B&B of the five stars it deserves.\\n\\nThe one \\"must try\\" item that is worth traveling to this place for are their roll-ups. They are like food baseball bats (literally) and knock the value and flavor out of the park. The Buffalo Chicken Roll-up is shredded and marinated with immense care. The Falafel and Hummus Roll-up (Chubby tip: ask to add feta and olives) is a traffic cone of Mediterranean and includes crisp, fresh veggies and their homemade falafels and hummus. You are left with absolutely no question about what your money bought you when they arrive. \\n\\nThe internet gives people this false sense of entitlement, because now behind the anonymity of it all, illiterate customers with invalid opinions can come out of the woodwork and pretend they're food critics.

Only there was hardly anything for me to hate, other than the long wait time to get a table in the morning.  Yes, they're that popular, but if you make a reservation you'll be fine.  Highly recommend.  Yes, their prices may be slightly high, but not by much.  I feel it's justified with the excellent tasting food that they serve, and so \\"totally worth it\\"!  Now let me share a bit more about Mother's:\\n\\n[ Parking ]\\nStreet parking, metered, majority of spaces are 2-hours max.  The meter will say no charge if its a holiday.  City parking is city parking, but I personally would just avoid the small parking area behind it.  \\n\\n[ Atmosphere ]\\nI was told they recently expanded and remodeled their dining area, so I cannot really compare between the look of last year with the new look this year.  I've only been here twice.  So to start, the foyer area or lobby, is usually congested with foot traffic and folks waiting for a table.  Their cafe side behind the hostess also seems to always be packed.  Again, \\"make reservations\\".  The walls are all lime-green and yellow.  I guess they were going for a brighter look.  With the decor being sort of like home;  Framed artwork, fancy chandelier, mirrors.  OK well almost like home.  They've even got a huge dining table if you've got a big party.  Onto the food! \\n\\n[ Breakfast ]\\n~ Wild Salmon Hash!  Oh man, what a winner!  If you're unsure of what to try, I recommend this dish.  I don't know what it is or how they came up with this combo, but it was simply delish!  \\n~ Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with Chicken Apple Sausage!  Like a cloud of fluffy goodness these too were delish, and went well with the chicken apple sausage.  The sausage was soft, some juiciness, and thankfully not overcooked.  \\n~ $15,000 Dungeness Crab Cakes Sandwich!  Holy mole!  The potato bun was nice and light, with the cakes sitting on top of their homemade tartar sauce.  Such a great combo that I feel was worth it!  I'm not a coleslaw fan, but I gotta say their's was on-point with less purple cabbage!  I can't stand slaw with a lot of purple.  Their housemade fries were good, but I've had better.  They're just fries to me, so no biggie. \\n~ Crunchy Challah French Toast!  Mmm mmm, another good one too!  Now that I've had both their French toast and pancakes, next time I'm going for some waffles!   \\n\\nOverall, as I had mentioned before, I tried to look for things I hated, but I just couldn't.  Mother's seemed so perfectly good (except for the long line) that it justifies the long wait in line lol.  People flock here for a reason, and I can see and have tasted why.  I almost forgot to add that their service from the staff had also been cordial and helpful as well.  Without asking, my water glass or coffee mug were always refilled.  I do regret not getting the names of the servers, but really kudos to all of them.  Mother's menu can be overwhelming, but the plates were very simple.  Simple, yet mouthwatering good!

Honestly the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant around Columbus. The food, for the most part, is always good. Their pho broth is exactly how it is supposed to be: clean and straight forward. The meat is slightly rare so it cooks in the broth and I love the meatballs. The only problem is that sometimes the broth is not hot enough and eating a luke warm bowl of pho is off putting.\\n\\nDuring the summer I get the vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls. DELICIOUS. The grilled pork has the right taste with a hint of lemongrass and not dry. The egg rolls at Huong's are my favorite because the flavors in the egg rolls are balanced without it being too salty when you pour in the fish sauce.\\n\\nI sometimes order the bun bo hue also.

By using a small spoonful of the ramen broth, everything tasted better.\\n\\nHere is a hot bowl of steamed rice, topped with Mapo Tofu.

Now when I visit, there is almost always a wait. You can order at the counter and take your food to go or now, they offer table service. They didn't take credit cards for a while, but now they do as long as you have a $10 minimum. \\n\\nIf you dine in, they have several tables of four and some larger communal tables where they will seat larger parties and/or multiple groups.

Both are solid. The banh mi is reliable and classic. Crispy, French bread with perfectly pickled carrots and radishes with cucumber and cilantro. On this visit, I noticed that they put the jalapeno on the side (which is a new twist - usually it comes right out on sandwiches - maybe it was a surprise to some). I usually have the tofu banh mi, and my husband opts for the BBQ pork. My son most recently tried the chicken, but we all preferred the pork to the chicken. This is my husband's favorite banh mi in the city. The menu now has an option where you can get a banh mi and pho combo, which seems like a great option if you are up for a larger meal.\\n\\nI always order an iced coffee (cafe sua da) - it's made perfectly here. Strong and creamy. We  also have enjoyed some of their smoothies. I am a fan of the avocado smoothie, in particular. It is heavy and creamy - almost a meal in its own. \\n\\nThe value is incredible. The restaurant is super casual, not at all upscale. Service is ok, but it is a super busy place. I don't get the impression that they want you to hang out for a while.

All of the good reviews for this place must be either fake or people with no palate to speak of.  The fried rice has no flavor aside from salt, with hardly any veggies or pork to be found. The egg rolls have a different flavor than most takeout egg rolls, they are very similar to the ones you find in the frozen foods section,  so most likely they are frozen and factory produced.  The dumplings also seem to be frozen from a factory, they are bland and much too uniform in size and shape to be homemade.  The worst offender by far was the wonton soup.  The broth had a strong chlorine flavor so either it was cooked or kept in something that was cleaned with bleach and not rinsed well, or made from highly chlorinated water.  Aside from the chlorine the only other discernible flavor was salt.  The wontons themselves were bland with a slightly off-putting flavor.  They don't even include free crispy noodles when you order soup.  The lo mein, general tso, sesame chicken, and chicken teriyaki were all just ok, not good or bad.

How long has this pie-shaped restaurant been here? Imagine your mother saying \\"Just a sliver, I gotta watch my girlish figure.\\" If they weren't so good at what they do, I'd suggest they sell pies instead. But they are good, at least four-star good.\\n\\nA friend and I were at South Station around five p.m. on a weeknight looking for dinner when he suggested Blue Dragon. Googlemaps says it's an eight minute walk but it couldn't have taken us more than five door to door, and that's with dodging commuters rushing to catch a train. \\n\\nThe space is laid out with the tables at the wide \\"crust\\" end and the kitchen and powder rooms at the point with the bar along the far slice. I'm not sure if it was the heat from the kitchen or the heat from, you know, heaters, but it was luxuriously warm, something that makes for comfort on a very cold spring day. While there were plenty of people there, including at the spacious bar, it was by no means crowded. But it was clear that they are prepared for crowds -- a pie-shaped hightop, for example, with no chairs but standing room for ten or twelve and carefully placed hooks centered underneath for satchels and backpacks. Most people don't mind standing to drink but most don't want to do with while holding a briefcase. Kudos to the designer for imagining real customers.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar, although we had other choices. Bartender was friendly and efficient and helpful. Didn't pressure us. Helped direct us to the kind of drink we'd like (after asking us what we like). Drink (the cocktail bar a block or so away) does this like it's the most amazing thing ever (and, well, it kinda is) but this bartender did it because she knows what she's serving. My cocktail - whiskey with lemon and ginger (I think) -- was very good. My date liked his as well. After dinner, we both got a mai tai, and let me say, outta this world! If you think you've had a mai tai because you had one at your local Chinese dive, think again. This drink is transcendent. \\n\\nDon't ask me what is it;\\njust go and make a visit.\\n\\nOh, and let me say, I don't know this bartender. Oh, wait. I do. She introduced herself. She's Kate -- very professional. Sometimes I think yelpers give a place a bad review in order to keep the riffraff away. Or because of one little miff. A lot of locals saying boo-hoo she didn't say hello and I'm a local and I want everybody to know my name. Okay, great. Ever consider that a good bartender isn't supposed to ask you if you want \\"the usual\\"? A good bartender offers anonymity. I mean, suppose you're in with a new date but were there the day before with another new date? Or you're in with an old date who doesn't know you've been here with new dates? Just be glad Kate makes killer drinks.\\n\\nOkay, the food. A lot of options. Hard to decide. We got pickled veggies -- good and crunchy -- and deviled egg. Yes, singular, but two halves and smooth and sriracha-singed with crunchy little somethings on top. Were they little onion rings? Not sure but tasty. I would get both again. The star app, however, was the roasted peppers dusted with what looked like crumbled cheese --feta? No, as it turns out, sesame ground to a dust. This dish is the best ever -- I would go back for it -- and, get this, it's totally vegan. I'm not vegan (see egg above) but wow. It's amazing what constraints -- like form in poetry -- can do for food.\\n\\nWe also got the barbecue dumplings. My companion loved them but for me they tasted forced, an unhappy fusion of southern sweet tomato flavors overwhelming the delicate asian flavors. It didn't work. Nor did the scallop and bacon pad thai. Maybe I was too full at this point? Scallops and bacon are a natural. But mashed in with the noodles, I wasn't sold. Based on my date's reaction -- he loved it -- as well as other yelpers, I know I'm a minority opinion. I did like, almost loved, the udon noodles with clams. They could have been a five if the noodles had been made in house -- they aren't; I asked -- and fully cooked. Still good, though.\\n\\nOverall, a really lovely evening of good drinks and clever food. A pleasant ambiance, comfortable and civilized.

And I immediately called my California friends to tell them about it. I mean - fried pie! Like a fruit empanada, it was amazing and perfect with my glass of port.

Super cute.  However, I have seen a lot of posts about the deli being subpar, and that was my unfortunate experience today. I gave a young deli worker my order, and then a gentleman behind me ordered.  Five minutes later, his came out first, and then I watched another worker start to make mine wrap while the youngster started on a milkshake. He must have been a regular, so he gets the better and faster experience?  A few minutes later, the sandwich still wasn't up, and I though it was a bit weird for it to take so long to make a chicken salad wrap with 3 ingredients!  I heard a worker call out, \\"chicken salad with lettuce!\\"...I said, \\"mine had pickles and tomatoes, so I'm not sure if that's supposed to be mine\\"...one of the workers said, \\"No\\", grabbed my wrap and tossed it on the counter saying, \\"I didn't know where you were\\", though I was standing five feet away.\\n\\nThough the workers didn't know I was a first-timer, my personal belief is that in a customer-service based industry, employees should treat each customer as if she were their first.

I hate saying that because I think they're doing great things for the city of Columbus. I find most places that are all the rage to be a tad overrated though. But as I said, I DO like it, and it IS good, but I wouldn't stand in a line more than ~15 minutes long. Maybe a liiiiiittle longer, depending on my mood. Standing in line for an hour like some people do? No way, I'd just go somewhere else. I won't stand in line for a long time for anything though, except roller coasters and the BMV (ugh), so take that as you will. Luckily, I've had good timing and have never had a long wait for chicken. \\n\\nSo here's a little breakdown:\\n\\nChicken: I prefer drumsticks and wings. Have not had their wings, just drumsticks. Good size, cooked well, crispy, pretty good flavor. I wish there was a little something else in the flavor, but I'm having a hard time putting my finger on what exactly it's missing. Warm heat has a bit of a kick, which is what I expected, so no surprise there. I don't think I could do Hot or Holy! The bread below the chicken is just plain-ole bread. I like bread a lot, so that's find with me. I'm not sure how other people utilize the bread with their meal, but I just eat it plain after the chicken spices have leaked into it.\\n\\nMac and Cheese: It was okay. I'm really picky about mac and cheese and prefer a sauce-y cheese rather than baked, if that makes sense? Baked just ends up sitting in my stomach from all the grease. Not a bad mac by any means, my preference is just a little different. \\n\\nSlaw: I actually really liked the slaw, even though it seems like it's what a lot of people say is just eh in their reviews!! I appreciate that it was a vinegary slaw rather than creamy, as creamy slaw makes me want to gag. Mmm...I could eat a giant plate of the slaw, seriously. I like eating a big bite of slaw after each drumstick since it helps a lot with the heat. \\n\\nI also have to say that I LOVE the pickles. I need to know where they get their pickles, because they are fantastic with a nice garlic flavor. \\n\\nPrice-wise, I think it's on point. Drumsticks meal is $10 and has plenty of food. Pretty filling, and I don't think it's overpriced. \\n\\nFree sweet tea and ranch dressing. I don't necessarily like either, so I haven't tried, but I may have to at some point. They also provide to-go cups for water or sweet tea. Everything is set up really well and it's all kind of straight forward.\\n\\nEveryone is so friendly and helpful. You can tell they really love what they're doing and have pride in their product. They want to make sure everyone has a good experience. That is great to see, keep it up! \\n\\nI'm kind of hovering between 3.5 stars and 4 stars, but will go with 4 :)"},{"name":"Rigoberto's Taco Shop","address":"15855 SE Mcloughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"03/04/19:  5 out of 5 - If you lived or visited SoCal, have crossed the border into Mexico, and eaten the Mexican night life street vendor foods, then you will, or need to know, this place is the \\"MUST GO TO\\" Mexican restaurant to eat at.  \\n\\nThe food is tasty, there is plenty of sauces and peppers to go around, it's priced fairly well, and I've been going to Rigoberto's for over 6 years.

So please at least be consistent so I don't have to be confused, decide to have mushrooms served in the broth or strained out. \\nI didn't feel fancy that day,so I got the petit filet and Mac and cheese.

You will get normal sized tables or oversized for 6 or 8 or even more.  However,  if you are two... beware.  you will be crammed into one of these little tables that many restaurants have found delightful to fill more seats.  We were two.  I was closer to the person on my right and left than my wife across the table.  The only way to get to the back side of the table is for the waitress to pull the table out so someone can squeeze into the back side then tuck the table up to you.  Zero privacy.  The place is very loud so you have to practically yell to be heard across the little table.  Drinks... meh.  My wife asked for a dry Chardonnay and the waitress didn't know what she was asking.  My bloody mary was, eh.  \\nMy wife had one of the signature lunch dishes on the first page describing how Mother from Hungary brought home cooking to Portland; cabbage rolls.  There were 2 rolls of limp cabbage around some burger filling that had obviously been microwaved before arriving; sitting in a pool of tomato sauce fresh from the can and sweetened with some sugar. I asked what her side dish was and she had to explain it was mashed potatoes.\\nI had the chilaquiles which were better than my wife's choice but quite bland since they were suppose to be full of chile. Some of the dishes I saw passing by looked decent enough, the eggs benedict  being quite popular.  \\nIn addition our seat was under the air conditioning and we froze.  All 3 tables in our corner, the people were in their jackets.  My dish was as cold as the refrigerator half way through the meal just from the cold breeze coming out of the ceiling.

I enjoy walking and checking out many different stores - it appeals to my need to move and squirrel brain. Disney Springs reminds me of an upscale outside mall. There are tons of name brand stores, like Zara and Anthropologie, with some Disney sprinkled in. When we first walked into Disney Springs, I remarked that I have no idea how they transformed Downtown Disney into what it is now. Even the layout seems completely different! There are some areas, like near the Rainforest Cafe or by the AMC that I recognized, but everything else is new. \\n\\nIf you are planning to eat at a popular restaurant, don't forget to make reservations ahead of time on the Disney app. The day before there was a 1:15 p.m. seating for Chef Art Smith's Homecoming, but the day of that time slot disappeared.

We walked in, and it was sort of a cluster f, to be honest. No one greeted us and we were confused as to whether you seat yourself or if you are supposed to be seated. The table we were eventually seated at was slightly dirty, the chairs were sticky and utensils were running low or out. The place was decorated with outdated, framed awards and featured articles from newspapers/magazines and a cute picture of a baby in a bowl of noodles lol! There were some separate tables, with one or two rows of tables in the middle, all pushed together to save space/fit more people.\\n\\nAll that aside, we were there to eat, so we both ordered pho -- only one size is offered at $6.50 each. I asked for my tai (rare beef) to be put on the side, so it doesn't get overcooked, but when it came out, ALL the meat was put on the side. D'oh! The quality of the pho was great, though. The noodles were cooked perfectly, beef broth was flavorful and not overly oily, and they gave us PLENTY of meat.\\n\\nAgain, it was a little confusing when it was time to pay, as there was no order stub like most Vietnamese places, so we went up to the counter (where other patrons were ordering some food to-go). I told the lady what we had and she found our order and rang us up.\\n\\nI wouldn't come here for their banh mi, though, because they are ever so slightly more expensive than QH and taste-wise, they don't hold up as well either. My mom has picked up banh mi's from Lee's a few times when QH runs out, so I can compare. They do, however, offer a larger variety of Asian \\"snack foods\\" than QH and it appears as if they sell some of their meats (e.g. their head cheese *shudders*), but they sit behind the glass at room temperature. Not sure I'd feel safe buying any of it. \\n\\nYes, BF did notice that there were more Caucasians than Asians in the dining area, and USUALLY that is a bad sign in terms of authenticity of food and other things, but not here. \\n\\nOnly three stars because I'm a clean freak and the place seems/is so dirty.

We hadn't tried too many \\"tapas\\" restaurants out, so why not start now?\\n\\nLittle Donkey has a very hipster, gentrified look to it, and it's very clean. The barkeeps wear black, shallow v-necks, sometimes sporting thick beards, and there's an obligatory server/hostess with the side of her head shaved. We were seated at a community table (not sure if I remember the phrasing correctly), and soon, we proceeded to order.\\n\\nWhat we ate: the foie gras sausage, the steak tartare, the Detroit pizza, the octopus a la plancha, and the phat lao.\\n\\nThe foie gras sausage was delicious! The bonito flakes and the pickled ginger on top gave it a nice bite and the sausage had a thin skin with a soft filling. I was disappointed by the bun though. It tasted like the cheap kind of hot dog bun you get at summer barbecues.\\n\\nThe steak tartare was also quite tasty, and they serve it to you on crispy toast. Wish there were more than a slice of bread with a spread though.\\n\\nThe Detroit pizza was good, but not aptly named. I'm from Detroit...and I didn't see or taste anything Detroit-like about it. The server told me that it had 'nduja on it but it wasn't overtly impressive. Go to Michigan next time and actually get Jet's Pizza, and you'll know what I'm talking about.\\n\\nThe octopus a la plancha surprised my friend and I mainly because of the texture and how different it was from the octopus that we usually ate.\\n\\nThe phat lao was a Thai-style noodle that was brown with soy sauce. There was some ground meat, meat floss, and peanuts with a lime. Pretty tasty!\\n\\nA couple of things - the servers largely ignored us despite our repeated efforts to get their attention. For a place as busy as it was, even trying to order food took much longer. We had to wait for our specific server to return, and she took orders from people who were seated well after us first.\\n\\nThe food was way too salty at times, especially the octopus and the phat lao. My friend and I were chugging water halfway through the meal and we kept hydrating well afterwards. It's not healthy to ingest that much salt in one sitting, and good food shouldn't have to rely on that much.\\n\\nFinally, I don't understand why it's called a tapas bar. Americans continue to distort tapas and up-charge everything, but I suppose it's better this way and will prevent more people from adopting a stereotypically American body shape. Regardless, Little Donkey shouldn't market itself as a tapas bar, but rather a bar that serves small plates of fusion food. It's very pretentious, kind of like Shojo, only the portions are a bit smaller.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd probably go back to try out the rest of the menu. I'll bring a blood pressure cuff just in case."},{"name":"Whataburger","address":"6301 W Parmer Ln, Bldg 3","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Last time I went I received my hamburger raw.

There are some other herbs that make the soup extra fragrant (not sure what they are), as well as Thai red chilies. Through having also tasted the beef phos and the fishcake soup, I think their broths generally are just really on point - a very nice balance of flavours and very clean tasting. I also really like their fried wings and fried fish dish. The batter is really light and crunchy, so you don't get a heavy feel after the meal. I will usually get either of those dishes if I am feeling extra hungry and want an appy to share. I have tried their vermicelli bowls as well, which are not as much of a stand-out in my opinion. The bowls weren't bad, just doesn't measure up to their soup noodle dishes.\\n\\nThere is often a line-up to get a seat at this spot.

According to the staff, the cost to make vs sell ratio wasn't good enough  Secondly, no more queso dip for your fries?! They offer it on top but not in its cup per usual. Another way to cut down on costs. This is in addition to many other menu changes that made it a gem in my eye. No more Terlingua burger, Primetime burger is different, fries are now over done and have about an 1/8 of the queso.\\n\\nI feel like I've been broker up with.

I do like their vegan cake doughnuts, not because they're vegan but because I just think they're better. Their apple fritters are my favorite option here because they use a good amount of cinnamon and nice, juicy chunks of apple. But that fritter is too close to $5 in price for comfort.

I attended Keegan's this past Thursday March 14th with my wife, my one year old daughter and two friends. We sat at the bar high tables and drank beers for about 90 minutes, as Thursday is \\"thirsty Thursdays. As time progressed we were asked to move our seats numerous times so the dj could set up for karaoke. We decided to move our seats and cash out at the bar. I left a $6 tip on $55 worth of drinks. Not the best tip, but certainly a tip.\\n We then sat at another high table at the bar for about another hour. In that hour I had two $4 beers and just didn't think to tip on this purchase as it's 2 beers over 60 minutes. At this point we cashed out at the bar and walked out the door after a great night of karaoke. As soon as we hit the door, the manager follows us outside and asks if our service  was ok because anytime patrons don't tip he is concerned  that something negative happened. This shocked my whole party. We immediately asked who didn't tip. He actually pointed at me and said my last name. I asked him to go inside and bring out the bill that I didn't tip on. He proceeds to bring out the $8 bill with 2 beers on it, and not my $60 bill that I had tipped on prior. I ask him to go get that bill. He comes back and whispers to me \\"my bad,\\" but at this point the damage is done. I asked him if he follows every customer out the restaurant that doesn't leave a 20% tip and he immediately starts talking about 2 drunk assholes he escorted out the bar a few days earlier after they didn't tip. I didn't understand the comparison. I was totally offended as were my friends who were with me. We are all African Americans btw, and there were no other African Americans in the restaurant. He then mentions a \\"clean\\" diaper that my wife accidentally left on The table before she walked home with my 1-year old daughter. All in all he ruined our night. I told him to go swipe my card for $10 since clearly we had been viewed as problem customers for not tipping and additional $7. This place is bullshit! The whole night my wife was getting dirty looks from other patrons who seemed to be unhappy with the presence of my infant daughter. The food also sucks. So if your in the mood for shitty food, karaoke, and being followed out of a restaurant for not leaving a 20% tip, then this is the place for you.

It was Spanish so I am assuming it was Dominican music. The fellow who greeted us was a friendly and serene gentleman. He made us feel at home without the usual useless banter we often encounter. He recommended the lemon juice which I ordered and it was the best lemonade of my life!!!!!!!! Then I ordered a dish which involved chicken and cheese stuffed in a banana. It was yummy!!

This wouldn't be a problem if I was still living in Vancouver; luckily, I visit often. (I always say the reasons I go back to Vancouver are [in this order]: 1. Mom, 2. FOOD, 3. Friends)\\n\\nOver the six years I've been coming here, there have been a few additions to their menu and the prices have gone up a bit (damn you inflation!), but little else has changed - in a good way. Besides the food, two standouts are the Malaysian d√©cor (e.g. traditional Malaysian kites, called mau, hang on the walls) and the very attractive female staff. As for the food, I've tried many of the items on their menu. But since I don't have the luxury of coming here whenever I want anymore, I've pared down the menu to a select few favourites that I always order. \\n\\nI start off every meal with a half-order of ROTI CANAI (flaky layered bread, http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/eUf08fT2qf-l8Ofi--sETw?select=H3dwlRD3z3g9BJAuywUB0w). It's incredible - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and full of buttery-goodness (but surprisingly not that greasy). The curry dip is amazing with it but the roti itself is so good it doesn't really need it.\\n\\nThe pi√®ce de r√©sistance has got to be the SINGAPORE LAKSA (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/eUf08fT2qf-l8Ofi--sETw?select=DbTvYKEOTUGpTpB6BWAhRw). O-M-F-G! My mouth has a mini-orgasm every time I have this. The coconut soup is so rich and incredibly flavourful with the dried shrimps and lemongrass. The rice vermicelli, which has a large surface area : volume ratio, is perfect for soaking up lots of soup! Same goes for the sponge-like tofu puffs :) The bountiful toppings of bean sprouts, egg, chicken, fish cake, squid and shrimp are all fresh and never overcooked!\\n\\nAnother favourite is the Alaskan BLACK COD WITH CARAMELIZED GINGER SAUCE. The sauce is sweet, savoury, garlicky, and goes perfectly with rice. Despite how flavourful it is, the sauce doesn't overpower the fish - which is fatty and super-flavourful itself.\\n\\nFor dessert you can't go wrong with the always-popular fried banana with ice cream. For something a little different, I always get the PULUT HITAM (black sticky rice pudding, http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/eUf08fT2qf-l8Ofi--sETw?select=_mCuDFyxvhVGn4L3VBVxOw, served with coconut milk, with or without durian). The sticky rice is served hot, has a great chewy texture, is not too sweet, and has a wonderful nutty/chocolate-y flavour.\\n\\nRecently, I had the fried oysters and braised lamb shank. The oysters (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/eUf08fT2qf-l8Ofi--sETw?select=67VtrUQ8SYgWECTw3779KA) were crisp, plump, and well seasoned with loads of cracked peppercorn. Though the lamb shank (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/eUf08fT2qf-l8Ofi--sETw?select=4opehz8O29a1YM3_iz0BpQ) wasn't as tender as I would like, it was flavourful and I liked all the cumin in the broth.\\n\\nI've never really had a dish I didn't like.

In fact, if I was rating on mixology alone, the Diamond would receive 4 or 5 stars.\\n\\nBut good cocktails don't make up for bad service (unless they are free?).  Having worked in restaurants and bars and the service industry for over 8 years, I have personally prided myself on delivering top-notch service. When I go out, I hope to be treated as I would serve others, and tip accordingly.\\n\\nSaturday night, my friends and I came to the Diamond for a few rounds. We were enjoying the cocktails as always, but when we went to settle up, ALL of their machines were down. In our bad luck, we had all brought out Visa and Mastercard. Which has sufficed as a payment method at bars for the past 6 years, across several continents..\\n\\nLong story short, our server was very close-minded and unapologetic about the situation. It sucks that their system was down, but as patrons this is not our fault. Basically the situation got extremely heated for nothing. Simple solutions to the problem: they could have taken our card numbers down and punched them in manually later - I used to work at a bar and we did exactly this in the same situation. In fact, at most restaurants, we had a manual machine we kept on file that takes an imprint of the card exactly for these situations. Or they could have taken an e-transfer to get funds instantly. Or called a technician to try and fix their machine. All viable solutions. But who knows, maybe they just wanted cash...\\n\\nIn the end, I finally spoke with Zach, the most reasonable person working there, who agreed that an e-transfer was a good idea. Thank you Zach for being open-minded in a crunch. But we had suggested this solution to our server AN HOUR before! She should have gotten management involved earlier since she wasn't capable of finding a solution. She kept suggesting that we use our credit cards on the debit machine...I don't know what bank she uses, but my visa doesn't give out cash. \\n\\nThis whole situation ruined what began as a lovely evening.

For the better or worse depends on how willing you are to move away from your old favorites and try something new.\\n\\nThe menu is smaller, with a lot of old favorites including Chicken Yakisoba, some of the sweeter cocktails, and a few other things taken off the menu. The menu went from a few long pages in a leather cover to a double sided paper. Our server explained that the chef is seeking to focus more on local and seasonal products, so that the menu stays fresh. Higher end ingredients such as duck and oxtail have been added to the menu.\\n\\nOn this visit we tried the new Sriracha Edamame which threw me off at first with its kick but after a few pods we were loving it. Think hot wing flavor but with house made sriracha. We also had the always wonderful Miso Soup and some fried pork Gyoza. The Gyoza are small but have great flavor. Way better than your usual takeout gyoza that tends to be greasy and too doughy.\\n\\nFor our meal we split 3 rolls: Sweetheart, Ichiban, and TNT Crunch. Sweetheart is my favorite of them all. No one does a sweet sushi roll quite like it. I love the crunch of the coconut shrimp and the mango sauce. TNT Crunch has a mild flavor but comes with a spicy sauce on the side and tempura flakes.\\n\\nDesert is different too, now. They offer teas, a few cake or bread based deserts, most of which come with a house made ice cream or sorbet. I was sad to see the Creme Brulee off the menu because their's is one of the best I have ever had! Perfectly crisp on top with a light sweet custard. Oh well.

I love cheese but I felt I was going to have a heart attack after eating it. It's  very big piece and I ate it all but felt very guilty.\\n\\nTurkey lasagna  paleo style - So this was interesting, I was trying to be healthy this time.  Instead of pasta, they used slices of eggplant.  The cheese on top I don't think was real cheese, it tasted kind of eggy.  The turkey and sauce was tasted but I felt it lacked flavor, but I figure this was healthy so It can't be so DELICIOUS..LOL..not really healthy food fan..but I try.  To be honestly I ended up putting lots of parmesean cheese on this dish for more flavor.\\n\\nCroissant sandwich with turkey, brie. This was a good sandwich, the croissant was actually pretty good.  I'm picky with my croissants, or example I hate the ones at Dunkin donuts, starbucks, any grocery store.  This croissant tasted like an actual baker made it rather than machines just mass making fake croissants.\\n\\nGreek salad - it was ok, sorry I can't get more enthusiastic.  Salads are just not my think, but I try to be healthy once in a while.\\n\\nSpaghetti and meatballs - Ehh...but I am picky with my italian food.  I wish they put a little more sauce.  The spaghetti was wheat pasta, which I didn't mind.  I just wished there was more sauce.  the meatballs were a bit dry and lacked flavor.

The lines were extremely long. I probably waited a good 30 minutes. Doesn't seem like a long time but I'm pretty sure the place JUST serves coffee and doughnuts and maybe some other little pastries. So, that's a pretty long time to wait for doughnuts. However; they're making them fresh and there was literally 5 million people in there. I really did enjoy the doughnuts, wouldn't necessarily say they're my top choice in the Portland area but they are definitely in the top 3 because they are amazingly good. I have my secret spot for my number 1 choice:)\\n\\nThe staff was nice and moved pretty fast once I got my order in. I purchased 2 dozen and ate almost all of them before I got home, no joke lol. I'm a sucker for doughnuts. The Nutella with cinnamon flavor was definitely my favorite. I did enjoy the ones with the bacon in it but I thought it was a tab bit too dry of a doughnut for me. \\n\\nI will for sure be back.

My friend did the Ninja IPA which was also good but too hoppy for me.  I preferred the Tiger Squadron Pale.  Bartender was friendly and gave great suggestions which is what you want when you're new to a place.  She even told us a few good places to fill our bellies.

Our experience was not like the others I have read about.  I struggled on giving this place a 1 or 2 stars.  \\n\\nThe waitperson came to our table to take our order, barely made eye contact.  My BF asked how they compare to Roscoe's and she said \\"We are not on that level, there is no way to compare with Roscoe's\\".  \\n\\nWe ordered one house margarita, three sides and chicken & waffles.  After she took our order she disappeared.  20 minutes later another waitperson looked over and asked if we had gotten the margarita yet.  She smiled as if she already knew how green our waitperson was and she walked to the bar to place the order.  10 min later she came by again and saw that the margarita had not arrived and she hollered over to the bartender to make it.\\n\\nShortly after our waitperson re-appeared to deliver the margarita and NEVER looked up or spoke to us.  Instead, she placed the drink on our table and walked off in a hurry.  The house margarita for $2 was decent and quite tart (which was a plus in my book). Three stars for the drink.\\n\\nAbout 10 min later our food arrived.  If you add the time from above, you will see that it was abut 40 min after the order was placed and the restaurant was not busy (3 other tables, 1 of which already had food when we arrived).\\n\\nChicken and Waffles were decent, definitely worthy of 3 stars. The collard greens and sweet potatoes were way too sweet and had too much all-spice (or similar), but I did not knock starts off for that because that is just my taste preference.  The fried okra however....um turn up the heat on that fryer please.  They were cooked to a golden crunchy light brown, but were in the fryer so long that they were full of grease.  I had to blot them with several napkins first.  I ate 1/2 the order and had to stop because the grease was too much.

I will add that the to-go container has been changed and appears to provide a smaller portion of food than the previous container. Usually I am able to share a 2 plate entree with the amount provided but it is a lesser serving with the new container. Lastly, I wasn't offered the \\"5 Flavored Shrimp\\" because a customer consistently changed their order, while the team member was attempting to move on to the next customer.

Everything's changed, and not for the better. Since their move, my husband and I have been back exactly three times. The first weekend, we were told it would be a 90+ minute wait and that they didn't have staff to seat in the front. Ok, so only being open at the new place for about a week, fine. I will give you that...\\n\\nSecond time sitting in we actually got a seat. Only a 30min wait so hope was high that things had settled down. Nope. Food took forever to come out, the table next to us had a little girl that was clearly hungry, and then another pair was sat to our right. Filling seats doesn't mean a good restaurant. \\n\\nFast forward a couple of weeks. Call in to place a pick up order, they aren't taking those kinds of orders yet but you can walk-in and takeout. Ok, sure. I'll drive down, stand waiting, and leave with my sandwiches.

We will not be going back. I ordered two sandwiches to go (again because they can't take orders over the phone). The young lady behind the counter was never really that attentive and over the course of my standing there for 35 minutes, never really moved with any kind of urgency. Indeed, most of the employees I saw were just going through the motions. \\n\\nA thing to note: corned beef hash takes longer to make than sandwiches. The patron that ordered that AFTER me (by quite some time) was served BEFORE me.\\n\\nWhen I finally got my sandwiches, I went out to the car. Lo and behold, both sandwiches were incorrect. Thankfully, my husband's was fine except for the bread. He was fine eating it. Mine, not at all. So back inside I went. \\n\\nSide note: When handling a complaint, that complaint should become your first priority. Apologize and get the information to the chef to fix it. You don't stand there talking to another guest, you don't take an entire other order, you don't refill coffees. Clearly this young lady doesn't understand food-service prioritization. \\n\\nBy the time she got around to going back into the kitchen I had to stop her. It had been 45min at this point and I didn't even have a correct meal.

What he got was not even close.\\n\\nI also witnessed the owner either firing or dismissing the chef while standing there. So...good luck to everyone else?\\n\\nQuestions for the owner:\\n1. Why are you trying to run a buffet AND the full regular menu at the same time?\\n2. What are you doing to train your staff??\\n3. Why did you move?!?! You had such a great thing going. It was small, yes, but I cannot believe you're happier here. I don't see any systems in place (waitstaff has no sidework?!), it looked like there were only a couple of food runners but why have runners if you don't have the restaurant full? Servers should be able to handle this task.\\n4. Why have you given up on your takeout services?! Your hostess today was useless. Inappropriately dressed in an oversized sweater, she looked ready for a day with the girls not the person handling your arriving guests. She could be taking those orders, processing payments and phone calls, and streamlining that entire portion of the program. \\n\\nFinal word: We aren't going back. We gave you chances, you blew it.

So, obviously I came here first to try what real cannoli is supposed to taste like. \\n\\nFirst of all, parking is insane, yeah worst than LA. But, I somehow always luck out and find amazing, free parking spots. This time, my luck did not fail me, even in another state, and I found parking directly infront of Modern Pastry.\\n\\nThe shop is a small mom and pop feel shop. There was no line and only one group sitting inside. There are only 3 saucer tables with about 4 seats per table. Theres a nice display of their pastries to the left of the shop and you order at the counter. Cannoli is not displayed like in Mike's Pastry, but in the kitchen. The shells are pre-made, but they fill upon ordering. (Mike's Pastry cannoli are pre-filled and left in the display). I ordered the the regular canolli with ricotta filling and almonds $2.50, chocolate dipped canolli with vanilla custard with sprinkle of almonds $2.50, tiramisu $3, sfoggliatella $3.00 flaky pastry filled with a mix of ricotta, vanilla custard, semolina, and cinnamon ($12.50). Sunday 12:30 pm no wait, quick friendly service! \\n\\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the Modern Pastry's ricotta filling. It was perfect and not too sweet. Im not a big sweet tooth type of person, I love my savory food, and this ricotta filling was light, airy, and delicious. It reminded me a lot of japanese pastry fillings where you get the soft texture without the heavy dose of sugar. I would come back again just for their original ricotta filled cannoli with almonds.

It was so good, we could not help ourselves. Actually, that's an understatement. It was one of the best cocktails that I've had in a long time. We also shared a handful of the small plates and for the first time, I don't have any photos to share. This place was so good- I forgot to take pictures because I was too busy eating. The Foie was cooked to perfection. The Vietnamese Bologna and Razor Clams Casino are an absolute must. The Wok Fried Long Beans were amazing.

You forgot shorts? Uniqlo is your best option, otherwise you're looking at spending a pretty penny. The springs is packed mostly with designer/boutique style shops that are anything but cheap. That being said, it's some nice stuff to look at. There's also a nice lego store that can keep kids occupied for a decent amount of time. There's also a little train ride and carousel with some other fun activities for children to do throughout the area. The Disney store is also, in my opinion, the best one in all of Disney, with tons of options not catering to any one special character. Disney Springs is also one of the only places in all of Disney that is open late, for adults who need a night away (although we did not get this chance).

It is for many out of towners, the quintessential brunch spot and often recognized as an institution in the downtown dining scene. It is so popular that folks are willing to wait for an hour or two for a chance to eat here and having dined here so many times in the past, it's not hard to see why.\\n\\nPortland's brunch (and general food) scene is so fierce, it'd be hard to anoint Mother's the king (or queen?) of brunch food in the city. Even their uber famous and vastly more local clientele have shorter waiting times, different menus, and cheaper plates. But in the end, part of the PDX experience has been to come here and enjoy a good brunch and for that alone, Mother's definitely brings its A game.\\n\\nThe food is easy to enjoy. It is Americana to the fullest and their array of brunch is nothing less than delicious. Enjoyable frittatas, a fun assortment of eggs in benedict form, hash anything, and delicious French toast variations make this brunch everything but dull. The dinner hour is no slouch, a fine pot roast, delectable mac and cheese, tasty meatloaf, and a multitude of seafood and vegan items for the inhibited.\\n\\nThe occasional gripes about service are noted, but when an establishment is as busy as this place, it also shouldn't be much of a surprise. I've been constantly lucky each time, I suppose being a familiar face never hurts in these parts. For Portland the prices are not back breaking and the ambiance is almost always a cool vibe.

The dan dan noodles weren't overly spicy and they were also coated in a layer of oil. The fried chicken was pretty good actually, I'd recommend getting that out of everything we tried. I thought this place would be more fusion, but to me it was more traditional with some twists that quite frankly weren't that interesting.

At no point did I feel like I was enjoying a relaxing brunch.\\n\\nThe service was friendly, but slow -- which makes sense, I suppose, given the number of customers. There's less of the welcoming feel of the old Mother's, and while I get how hectic it must be, it was busy at the old spot, too.

The drink was creamy, delicious, and super creative - different from anything else I've ever had.\\n\\nIf I had to critique it, I would say that the black sesame overpowered the matcha, and I couldn't taste the matcha at all. Also the bottom gets a little gritty and I got a lot of black sesame stuck in my teeth. But hey, at least I know it's not artificial flavoring.\\n\\nThey are NOT a boba place. I don't think they have boba. Also, the drinks are on the more expensive side, $6.42 a pop. It's worth checking out though!\\n\\nUPDATE: They do have boba, but it's extra on top of the $6.42.

We sat on picnic tables and waited outside for about 40 minutes before being seated. Once seated a friendly waitress served us both \\"the hungry man\\" which was very good.

We opted for a half portion of the crunchy french toast, full order of the wild salmon hash, and the house special fresh-baked pecan cinnamon roll. We also ordered a warm coffee drink with Ghirardelli alcohol. The drink was pretty good, it was a nice addition on the cold day. The french toast and cinnamon roll were nothing out of the ordinary. The cinnamon roll was different from other cinnamon rolls in that instead of it being round and swirled, it resembled more of a slice of baked bread. I do wish the cinnamon roll came out a big warmer like if it just came out of the oven. I think it would have tasted a lot better warm, melting in your mouth. It was just a bit too hard for me to bite, I am used to cinnamon rolls being super soft. The half order of french toast comes with two slices, just perfect for sharing. It was not as crunchy as we had hoped and there was nothing spectacular about the taste. It resembled normal french toast that you dip with maple syrup to add more sweetness and flavor. \\nI must say the best part of the meal was the wild salmon hash. We never had anything like it and it was AMAZING. It was super flavorful. Everything in that dish tasted wonderful and blended well together. This has changed my life forever and I may start to order wild salmon hash at brunch places now. The hash is the thing that makes it worth 4 stars!\\n\\nThe ambiance is funky and casual.

I could taste shallot and capers in the dressing.\\n\\nThings that were alright:\\n(1) Parker House Roll stuffed with yellow chives and chinese sausage.\\nThe flavor of the filling was light.\\n\\n(2) Escargots a la Bourguignonne served in garlic butter and cognac\\nThe snails were fresh and large. The snails were served in the shell. The dish was on the salty side.\\n\\n(3) Shrimp Toast \\nIt consisted of a slice of sourdough bread topped with dried shrimp, fresh mint, and lots of fish sauce.\\n\\n(4) King Crab Fettuccine\\nIt consisted of fettuccine cooked with xo sauce and lemon and garnished with king crab, tomatoes, and chives. The noodles were either under cooked or over cooked. There was a strong lemon flavor.\\n\\nThings that I don't recommend:\\n(1) Lobster Rangoon served with yuzu kosho, tobiko, and peach duck sauce\\nIt was not crispy. The rangoon was really rich. The dipping sauce was really spicy. I didn't like the combination of flavors.\\n\\n(2) Black Peppers Popovers served with waygu steak tartare\\nIf you like spicy, I'd recommend. However, after expressing how much we cannot handle anything spicy, it was too spicy for us to consume.\\n\\n(3) Shaved Artichokes\\nIt contained of radishes and kohlrabi in a ginger miso dressing. I couldn't tell that there was any artichoke in the dish. I felt like it was nothing special and reminded me of an Asian Chopped Salad Kit from Costco."},{"name":"Tropical Cuisine","address":"4899 Old National Hwy","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"When you walk in TROPICAL cuisine you can seat yourself.

It had a lumpy consistency and did not taste like crawfish.\\n\\nSOUTHWESTERN LETTUCE WRAPS- fresh lettuce cups, diced grilled chicken, black bean and corn salsa, fresh avocado, and sweet chile dressing\\nThe lettuce wraps was the worst thing I've ever eaten! The flavors were bland and one noted. I thought the sweet chile would add some sweet or spicy addition to the dish, but it didn't. The corn salsa didn't have that crunch that I would've liked and the chicken also didn't have much flavoring to it either.\\n\\nOverall, this place was a huge disappointment.

A monopoly, because many of these restaurants, which seem to be not connected, are actually staffed and managed by a common firm, despite how local the restaurant's name is.  I believe this to be the case with Maudie's at the airport in Austin.\\n\\nMy receipt had \\"Delaware North Companies\\" on the top of it, just as my receipt from a restaurant in Denver's airport had later that day.  The cost of an enchilada \\"dinner\\" (it was a very small meal packed to-go style in styrofoam container) was $6.95 but with tax and a bottle of water, it was nearly $10.  \\n\\nThe beef enchilada and con carne sauce was adequate in flavor, but since I had been to Maudie's sit-down location in Austin, my expectations were slightly higher than what was delivered.  The rice and beans had zero flavor and if one was blindfolded, one could only distinguish between one or the other based on the texture.\\n\\nThe food was ready promptly, but the staff was spiritless... wearing a \\"Salt Lick\\" hat to staff the Maudie's counter. \\n\\nBottom line: you're stuck with what you get at an airport, and they know it.

And despite history showing that these absolutes are more often abandoned than achieved, I forged ahead with my \\"spend more time with my people\\" absolute and super fun idea. And as a result, I had tried to get 14 of my friends to dine at the same time in the same place. PSA: don't ever do this. Finding a date and time, figuring out who likes what, and what price range they're comfortable with, and where they're willing to drive, quickly become a logistical nightmare and sucks the super right out of the fun of your super fun idea.\\n\\nAnyway, i reached out to Old Thousand because their reviews looked good, the location was good, and come on - who doesn't like Chinese? My email inquiry was answered quickly by Christen. She could not have been more welcoming and professional. Christen asked about dietary restrictions and then gently suggested that a fixed menu might be best for a group of our size. She recommended an exact menu for us with a broad array of dishes. She offered all sorts of options and substitutions, and even did the math by providing the subtotal and the per person price we should expect. We e-shook on it.\\n\\nThere were about 6 days between the day Christen and I finalized, and the date of our outing. Each day it seemed something changed - some were in, then they were out, someone else got sick, someone additional was joining, one couple bailed last minute because they got into a huge fight over (get this) a fart, someone suddenly declared themselves a vegetarian - nothing we threw at Christen phased her (well the fart might have phased her but I spared her that detail)...I kept emailing her every time something changed (pretty much daily because...don't try to organize 14 people) and when our final count had dropped, she revised the menu to accommodate fewer people - always being aware and respectful of our experience, our desires, and our cost.\\n\\nWe had the pickled cabbage - tender crunchy bites with a welcoming kick in the tastebuds - a great way to start the meal. Next up we had scallion pancakes - delicately fried triangles with a tasty sweet soy dipping sauce. The Chongqing chicken provided the perfect sichuan wake up call. Lightly fried bites of boneless chicken with a very flavorful, dry seasoning (this dish shed not a spot of grease). There was more - the Kung Pao Cauliflower and the brisket fried rice were both unique seasoned and delicious. Finally, the Char Siu dumplings were light and fluffy but the pork belly was a little too fatty for our taste which was our our only complaint.\\n\\nWe had a delightful experience at Old Thousand from start to finish.

We ordered and appetizer to start, Vegetable Pakora, it came out quickly and was quite tasty. We then waited, and waited for our waitress to return, she was just sitting behind the bar talking to a coworker. Finally I had to get up and ask for assistance from the other girl working. She came over to take our order, and not sure what the issue was, but she had no clue what I was saying, in spite of pointing to exactly what I was ordering on the menu, she was still confused...this is never a good sign. My daughter and husband are highly allergic to dairy, and I was worried this would be lost on the confused server. I pointed to \\"kids menu\\" and the \\"vegetarian\\" option since she didn't understand when I said it. I said \\"dairy free\\" about ten times, she seemed to understand and took the rest of our order and went to the bar to give our relaxing server our order. \\n\\nWhen the food came out, the fruit consisted of canned peaches and slimy old cucumbers which my daughter didn't want to eat. The lentil soup that came with it was a much lighter color than the last time we had ordered, but I didn't think about it at the time because we had waited so long we were starving! Luckily she only had one bite and also didn't like the soup, but my husband finished it for her. He immediately began having an allergic reaction, and she had one the next day. They had made her soup with regular milk, not coconut milk as we had asked! \\n\\nThe regular menu items come out in a tiny bowl, w an even smaller portion of white rice, which would be fine if the staff came back to give you a chance to order more. The food isn't bad, but it's not great either. \\n\\nWhen you don't have competent people serving food, you are putting your customers health at risk, our dairy allergy isn't a preference, it is a medical condition and the food we were irresponsibly served made my family sick. \\n\\nNepal Cuisine opens back up Friday and we will be giving them our business, and never returning the this establishment again."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My hubby and I were able to visit this wonderland twice this month.

After trying Mike's Pastry, I would say that Mike's cannolis are some of the better ones I have tried, but I still wouldn't say that I am a convert. \\n\\nThe cannoli shells were thin and crispy, and the filling was light and mildly sweetened. I was impressed by how the cannoli shells remained flaky, even with the wet filling. With that said, this is not a permanent thing; I would caution buying too many cannolis at a single time, no matter how tempting it is. I made this rookie mistake, and woke up to a box, full of soggy cannolis.\\n\\nAmong the flavors that I have tried, Florentine stood out. If you are a classicist, I would advise that you stay away from this particular flavor, but if you like a little innovation and creativity, try the Florentine. The sugary-coating on the Florentine cannoli was a wonderful contrast to the creamy ricotta filling.\\n\\nIn addition to their famed cannoli, Mike's Pastry also offer a large selection of Italian baked goods, ranging from cookies to cakes. Among them, their sfogliatella (Lobster Tail) was worth noting. While I thought the cream inside was scrumptious, the outer shell texture was too clunky and heavy for my preference. Maybe I am being a snob, but one thing I absolutely appreciate about a sfogliatella is the beautiful and delicate layers of pastry, but I didn't see that in Mike's version.\\n\\nThey are cash-only, and the wait will be long, no matter the time of day, day of the week.

The burger tasted like that nostalgic goodness you can only find at your local peewee football snack stand, but then add onion soup mayo and foie gras...NOM.  The miso banana bread in the toad-in-a-hole is amazing.  Surprisingly great combination with the runny egg, savory creamed spinach, and saltiness of the sausage.  This dish is definitely a must-order.  However the carnitas hash was pretty standard."},{"name":"Le Cellier Steakhouse","address":"1510 N Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We went in on a whim hoping we could be sat, knowing there was a possibility we wouldn't be without a reservation.

It only takes a few times in for them to start treating you like family. The service is incredible. The owners are always present checking on the dining room and making sure that everything is running smoothly. The hosts, bartenders, and servers are friendly and welcoming. \\n\\nThe food at Karma is exceptional. The sushi is the best I have had outside Boston/Cambridge. The simple preparations highlight the quality of the ingredients and the more intricate ones show off the sushi chef's creativity. \\n\\nIf you aren't in the mood for sushi the rest of the menu has loads of delicious options covering a variety of Asian cuisine. To wash it all down there is a full bar with a great assortment of drinks. The house favorite is the Megan's Mai Tai, named for the owner.  It doesn't taste like it but it really packs a punch.\\n\\nMy most highly recommend dishes include the tuna taco, prepared table side, it's a spicy tuna served over wanton crisps.  The pan fried gyoza is always excellent. The spicy bomb with lobster is an incredible dish. It's fatty and spicy with tempura lobster and a nice kick of hot sauce. Be sure to eat the lime, rind and all for maximum flavor.\\n\\nThe pad Thai and basil fried rice are solid choices if you are a more traditional eater. And if you want an off the menu surprise order the \\"salmon on fire\\" which is thin strips of salmon over an open fire which you can cook to your desired doneness.\\n\\nFor sushi, it's hard to go wrong, but a few of my personal favorites include the saba sushi which is a pickled mackerel that has a strong fishy and strong vinegar taste at the same time. (Not for everyone) Also amazing is the spicy tuna tempura with volcano which includes baked spicy scallop. You also can't go wrong with more traditional sushi like a yellowtail and scallion maki, a sake nigiri, or a crazy maki which includes shrimp tempura and spicy tuna.\\n\\nKara is a hot spot in Concord and can be very crowded, especially on the weekends so it's best to have a reservation. The decor is modern with Egyptian glass tile and wooden woven light fixtures. It's a welcoming environment and you will see large groups, first dates, and families with little kids all sharing the same space. If you come when a movie is filming in Concord, you are likely to spot a celebrity grabbing sushi.\\n\\nIt's hard not to love Karma. It has been my go to spot since it opened two years ago and has yet to disappoint. It's not cheap, but nothing in Concord is.  If you do go in, tell them I sent you.

Every meat, from the pulled pork to the ribs, needed buckets of the lackluster sauce to disguise the dryness and lack of smoky goodness. None of it was very hot, either in temperature or in so-called spiciness. The cornbread tasted like day-old baked goods from one of those coffee shops that look like the baristas produce black tar heroin with the espresso equipment.

He did a great job telling me all of the options, checking on how I was enjoying everything, and making sure I left happy. It was a very personal experience.\\n\\nCrispy Wild Boar Ribs were a good started. Smaller than I expected, they were more so the size of chicken wings.

Not the restaurant's fault it's one of my least favorite flavors but it is their fault it still wound up on my ribs.\\n\\nHad the Mustard and Brown Sugar Crusted USDA Prime Ribeye for my entree. Definitely a good steak. I like what they did with the melted sugar on top. Was cooked to a solid medium. Other than the brown sugar it was just ok. Good but at $42 I didn't feel it quite lived up to the cost. I've honestly had a better steak in Austin that week for half the price.\\n\\nThe pork chop my friend got was juicy and delicious. Not much to say about it since it wasn't mine but I did try it and the seasoning on it was right where it should be.\\n\\nAs for the sides, the macaroni and cheese might have been the biggest disappointment of the whole meal. I think it had the biggest promise given how it sounded and looked. The problem with it was the goat cheese. It overpowered everything else about the dish. I liked the texture of it, I just thought everything was muted by the goat cheese.\\n\\nThe Brussels Sprouts with bacon and brown butter definitely get top marks. Cooked too a good consistency.

And at higher prices it is probably better to skip this factory of desserts. We started with the Baked Brie. Served with fresh fruit and toasted almonds, it would have been great, but the brie was not the right selection. They needed a milder and sweeter option as this one was too earthy and intense. It also comes with some chocolate almond bread, which is weird, but fun. The Cookie Jar Milkshake was okay.

I get that it is more about the picture than the actual taste, but for the price I expected better.\\nQuantity: Both items we ordered were made to share. Two persons to a milkshake is probably the correct ratio.\\nValue: $13 for the Baked Brie. $13 for the Cookie Jar Milkshake.\\nAmbiance: The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen is a giant restaurant found in Universal's City Walk. Even in a place where most of the restaurants are elaborate, this place stands out. Designed like a factory, it is a massive building with multiple floors of dining, a candy store, a take-out milkshake bar, and even a standard bar.

It is all handled in a steampunk style so expect to hear versions of songs you know remixed in an old-timey fashion.\\nCrowd: The massive restaurant was almost completely empty. A few families were spread across the space, but not even a quarter of the tables were filled.\\nService: The staff is extremely enthusiastic about the different items on the menu, to the point that it does not seem genuine.

After I got through that, and delivery which took 15 minutes longer then they said it would, the food arrived.  First, what I ordered.   The Pu Pu platter:  it was all breading and tasted like someone put a shrimp in a cornbread biscuit.  The entire thing was terribly overpriced and tasted awful.  Next, I ordered Shrimp and Snow Peas.  There were a total of five shrimp.   Wow, big spenders!   It was tolerable I guess, it was just short on the protein part of the meal, as was the shrimp egg roll that I ordered.   Had one shrimp and a whole lot of undercooked breading inside.  Then I ordered and paid for shrimp fried rice. I got fried rice.  Thanks for stealing $5 from me.  All in all, I'd say this was one of the worst Chinese meals I've had in years.

The boy ordered the usual Berry Blossom, which now comes in a short stout glass with diced strawberries and a berry skewer.  The restaurant offers a free sushi panini on your birthday, and since we hadn't tried it before, this was an opportune time.  We were both a little skeptical about it having read the description in the menu, but after trying it, we are definitely converts.  The crispy rice, the flavorful salmon, the avocado -- the blend of ingredients was unusual but the flavor was great!  For dinner, we went with sushi -- a Philadelphia roll, a spicy tuna roll, an eel roll (all half price), salmon nigiri, and splurged on the Scarlet Craze.  The basic rolls were good, the salmon nigiri was exceptional, and the Scarlet Craze, though it carried a hefty $17.25 price tag, was worth every penny.  Taking into consideration the happy hour specials, our bill came to about $55 including tip.\\n\\nWe have been to quite a few sushi places in Columbus during our 3+ years here, and Moshi is the best of them when you take into account the quality, service, and ambiance.

Macarons, chocolates, marshmallows, cotton candy, (Absinthe!) lollipops, etc. They also have really neat glass bottles with different candies, (rock candy, sixlets etc.) in them that are totally in line with the steampunk vibe that the entire restaurant is themed with. A lot of things are pretty expensive - like $12 for a large mason jar of cotton candy, or $9 for half a dozen flavored marshmallows...or their larger box of chocolates at $50. Wow. I really wasn't down with that, but I bought a few things anyways because it was just so neat and I felt that most likely, I wouldn't see things like this anywhere else. I guess they're banking on that, and it worked. Anyways....\\n\\nSo the restaurant - again, super cool. Lots of steampunk elements going on - waiters, waitresses - everyone dressed in themed garb. There are big screens on both walls of the main downstairs space that show an interesting scene of a candy factory - but steampunk style. Upstairs servers as another bar, and has seating overlooking the big curved staircase, or out across the river to the City Walk - beautiful both ways. The lighting fixtures, booths, and everything else emulate the same style and are both fun, and well done. The menu, (see my pictures) is beautifully done inside and out. Their food is incredibly interesting, from their drinks all the way down to their desserts. Everything is decadent. Black and tan onion rings with cacao ranch sauce? Hell yes! Chocolate Porter, (house made) rubbed chicken wings? Yah... A bunch of varieties of Old Fashioneds with different infused whiskeys and bitters? Pfft... you're killing me. Their Reuben with truffle fries was also fantastic, albeit a tad dry. I also had a Wicked Cherry cocktail, which included a whole chocolate covered cherry.

The glass display cases proudly present their delectable and award-winning cakes, and the owner of Piece of Cake clearly has a passion for frosting.  She will matter of factly answer your questions and uphold the Chantilly's title as the best cake in Portland.  I don't disagree; the Chantilly is a wonderful combination of chocolate cake and vanilla frosting, and they have a specialty came that combines the chantilly with an extra layer of creamcheese for undeniable decadence.  Piece of Cake sells wheat-free and vegan cakes that don't taste second-best at all.  I suggest you make the point to linger in the bakery to fully absorb the peculiarity of the atmosphere.  Marilyn will bring your cake to the adjoining room which is full of costumes, old furniture, papers, books, and photo albums of old cakes.

The taste of the actual milkshake is pretty simple and basic, but still delicious. Very smooth and light milkshake to even our how sweet the toppings can be, which is why I enjoy it. They often are a little melted though, which is disappointing. Extremely over priced as well. It always confuses me how the one I enjoy, the brownie, which is literally just a milkshake with a brownie on top, is 13$ verses a $12.50 one with a red velvet cupcake and white frosting and whipped cream and sprinkles. Makes no sense to me. \\nI recently came to toothsome for my sisters birthday party. There were good and bad things about this experience. The good is that the environment was very inviting and exciting. I thought it was weird that they didn't come sing happy birthday to my sister, though they did put a candle on her cupcake ON her milkshake. The burger was decent, but lacked a little bit of flavor. I got the avocado and egg burger and it needed salt. Bacon would of made it perfect. The beef was very tender though. I also thought it was odd that there were issues with the menu.

You have to pay $5 for \\"self-parking\\", which literally means that you pay them $5 for you to drive around the parking lot and find a parking spot. I found that to be not only inconvenient but unnecessary, because you not only pay to park but you also spend around 10 minutes looking parking.\\n\\nThen, when you're finally parked and you walk into the restaurant you'll find a gift shop to the left hand side, which I'm not entirely sure why they have one. Another thing you'll notice is a sign that literally says that if you've been waiting for 10 minutes to be seated, wait another 10 more. That's something that they take extremely serious as my friends waited for almost an hour to be seated.\\n\\nOnce seated we got the menus throw on the table by one of the hostesses. Then, the prices were extremely insane. I get it, it's Orlando, it's I-Drive and it's filled with tourist but come on $7 for pineapple juice. On top of that there is almost no vegan options, all I had was the expensive pineapple juice. The portions, from what I saw around the table, were super small compared to the prices. Not good at all.\\n\\nLastly, they have the night club area at the back of the restaurant. During the day anyone is allowed to dance, enjoy the atmosphere and have a good time, but after a certain time you must be 21 to stay/enter. In reality though, nothing changes as they play music and they serve drinks during the day time, so I don't know why they do that.\\n\\nOverall, my experience was eh, below average, and if it wasn't because it was my friend's birthday, I probably wouldn't go."},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The reservation was unnecessary this time around and I heard it was not needed because traffic flows and there are many bays.

The second case was the better, filled with butter cookies, almond cookies (amaretti), my favorite tri-color cookies, etc. Lots of authentic Italian cookies. And cookie assortments were available in plastic clamshells. As a poor college student, I allowed myself, on occasion, to pick one cookie from among the many on offer.\\n\\nFast forward to today.

Beautiful, mediterranean architecure houses the elitest of the elite shops and restaurants. \\n\\nI enjoyed my birthday dinner at Rick Bayless' Frontera Cocina: a jawdropping mexican restaurant with beautiful tile details and a view of the emerald blue shimmering water that is the Disney Springs. After that, I popped across the \\"street\\" for a free birthday cupcake from Sprinkles!! \\n\\nI wished that I had more time to spend in between park visits, maybe wandering around to Anthropologie, or trying out the other fantastic new restaurants that are opening up left and right. After a preview at this year's Party of the Senses, I will definitely be back to try out Paddlefish when it opens early next year. It's about time that the Downtown nightlife got this facelift and glamourous new feel."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Disney parks like the Disney downtown in California but on larger and much nicer scale\\nA lot of Disney shops l, clothes shops and restaurants.

Good food, Good drinks, horrible service.  Every one of the different dishes and tacos I have tried have been amazing and the free chips and tomatillo salsa hit the spot!  The drinks are amazing with a good beer list including Corona and Dos Equis all the way to Day of the Dead Ipa and Other smaller Mexican breweries.  Their cocktails have great flavor and are decently strong, while not overwhelmingly alcohol to punish the patrons.  They have creative spins on Margaritas and other traditional Mexican cocktails!\\n\\nThe service every single time I have been in there has been truly wretched.   The first time, our waitress took 25 minutes to take our order and then got both orders wrong.  Then tried to charge us full price on the bill. The most recent time we found some seats in the bar area it took literally 15 minutes to be acknowledged by someone who would take a food order from us.  We were so happy just to be given chips and salsa that we applauded the guy who gave them too us. Lastly and Im not sure what's going on with the ac, it's so hot in that place.  Uncomfortably so, we felt traces of air during our stay but honestly they need a better system or a system that works.  This is Atlanta and you're in a new swanky part of town, people don't show in athletic shorts most of the time, cool the place down or people won't come!\\n\\nAll in all this review would be five star if they could fix those two issues, the food and the cocktails are superb and worth a visit during the fall or winter when you have 2.5 hrs."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Hearty comfort food.

My only real gripe was just that the proteins we got were a little on the blander side. We got the chicken tikka masala and lamb korma, the chicken tikka masala just didn't seem as rich as I'm used to. The lamb korma also just seemed slightly blander to me, but was definitely better than the chicken tikka masala. They also have pretty interesting non-traditional menu options like jerk chicken which I am interested in trying in the future.\\n\\nI think for the price, this place is super solid but I'm also just cursed to never be satisfied by most Indian food. \\n\\nProtips: People sleep on chaats. They're Indian savory snacks, the word chaat literally refers to licking ones plate clean, and trust me if you ever have one I guarantee you'll want to be doing just that. Try the bhel puri!

First of all, the fact that they don't take reservations annoyed me because I decided on coming here with my husband on a whim because we wanted to surprise our son, and I was so hungry! It was an early Monday evening and the wait was an hour. Ok, at least the desserts will be totally worth the wait, I thought. You can actually get some dessert selections on the main floor (downstairs) to-go! Everything I saw looked so scrumptious, so I was excited about that! Once we were actually taken upstairs to eat, I was actually overjoyed to see that the menu includes brunch selections all day! This had ME written all over it! I ordered the Country Fresh French toast & it was absolutely AMAZING!!! My husband also ended up ordering a French toast selection (Patty Melt) & he loved it! Also, our son ordered a waffle, so we basically had brunch on a Monday evening, which added to the fun of eating in a chocolate factory! Of course, we couldn't even finish our meals because the portions were so large, but we came for dessert, so it was a must! I ordered the May Contain Nuts, husband ordered the Peanut Butter Indulgence milkshake (with the souvenir jar) and our son ordered something that was chocolate, chocolate, and a tad bit more chocolate! It was all delicious, and no one could finish their desserts! Totally worth trying, though! And you know what!? Extremely affordable!!!

So much so that I thought I'd write a review! I always order take out for my mom, dad and myself. I was lucky that they tried it, raved about it, and got me to try it out as well.\\n   I have tried multiple dishes there, and I am giving them 5 stars because there has not been ONE thing I did not like! I never eat inside, but always pick up at the bar. It is a nice bar at that. Looks like a relaxing space to unwind after a long day at work. Ordering over the phone can be a little tricky at times, but even so, they have never messed up my to go order. \\n   Let's talk food. One of my favorite dishes there is their chicken enchiladas. I get mine in flour tortillas (vs the corn they come in) and smothered in queso. YUM! They are packed full of shredded chicken. Absolutely delicious! Just typing about them is making me crave them! Another one of my go-to entrees there is Rookie's Fajitas. It's a little on the pricer side at $17.00, but one great thing about Rookies is that you get a ton of food for the money! Quality food at that. Rookies Fajitas comes with steak, grilled chicken, the most delicious chorizo, and sauteed peppers and onions. One time when I was inside picking up, a man at the bar overheard my order and said their fajitas were the best and that I needed to get a side order of their avocado sauce. To be clear, NOT the guacamole. Its a smooth avocado sauce that is DE-lish. A must try when going. Its not on the menu, so you have to ask for it by description. My dad always orders the carnitas. The portion is so big, I always get to take home his left overs! They are also quite tasty. They come with cilantro and yummy pickled onions. The pork tastes like its been marinading all day and is fall-apart tender. Another yummy dish I've tried is their chicken quesadilla. My mom ordered it before and I tried hers. It was so good, I got it the next time. Definitely one of the top 5 quesadillas I've had in town. This one is big and fluffy not like the ultra flat ones I've had before, and of course the fresh, quality, ingredients. I also want to add that I really enjoy the mexican rice Rookies serves with their dishes! Most of the time when I get mexican rice it is as blah as can be. This one actually has some flavor and pieces of corn which I enjoy.\\n   Moral of the story- ROOKIES ROCKS! Do yourself a *flavor* and go check them out!

There were no games of any significance in any of the 3 major sports that night so it was pretty quiet which was fine by me.\\n\\nIt was pretty late, around 10:30, and they close at midnight.  We walked in and there were only a couple waitresses and the one bartender working.  No one came to seat us so we just grabbed a couple menus and sat at a table that had a good view of the TVs.  Unlike other reviewers I don't get my panties in a bunch b/c no one came to seat us right away.  I'm pretty easy going so me and my friend just sat ourselves.\\n\\nOur waitress came to our table very soon after.  She was very pleasant and friendly and took our drink orders.  Now this is not a 4 star Michelin restaurant so don't expect some amazing haute cuisine.  It is a sports bar people so temper your expectations and it'll be fine.\\n\\nI had the chicken wing sliders with jerk chicken sauce and a side of fries.  My friend had the cobb salad.  No complaints at all.  The food was tasty.  Nothing amazing but good, standard bar food.\\n\\nThe drinks were pretty strong and I was pleased.  The waitresses were decent looking and I'm never one to complain about girls in bikini tops.

I finally popped in today after stalking them on social media for a year. YUM. Warm mini donuts and chai tea? Sign me up. Nice on a cold morning. It's a bit of a shlep for me from the reaches of North Portland, but I was in the neighborhood and stopped by. 100% worth the trip on their own merit from now on. \\n\\nI tried the bacon maple and the flavor of the month which was a warm apple topping, they were both tasty, but honestly the raw honey and salt flavor just super topped the donut pyramid for me, followed closely by the cinnamon and sugar. I'm allergic to Nutella so I can't tell you how those were, sorry! I imagine pretty good though. \\n\\nThe King And I chai was the one I opted for, it's a pretty traditional tasting chai, and very yummy. I just saw from another review that they have chai flights.

The area used to be called Downtown Disney and had a section called Pleasure Island which was an area of bars and night clubs. The only remnant of that area now is Planet Hollywood.\\n\\nAbout a third of the area is under construction currently as they build more shopping and restaurants, making the area completely family friendly. There's a good mix of retailers with general merchandise and Disney themed stores. The popular Disney stores are the Star Wars and Christmas stores.With the new Star Wars movies out they have an entire store dedicated to the movies with all the apparel, toys, housewares, and junk. The Christmas store is every single Disney character made into an ornament along with other housewares and decorations like stockings.\\n\\nThe biggest let down in the area for me is the restaurants.

Being from Mexico originally, we wanted to verify its authenticity, as a real-deal Mexican restaurant would be a great addition to the town. Upon arrival, we were worried that they wouldn't be able to accommodate our large party but to our surprise, the service was swift and we were seated promptly. The decoration and vibe of the cafe is very nice, as it incorporates traditional Mexican pieces as well as a very cozy, family-like layout (making it seem like you are being served a home cook meal!). We were greeted by the lovely staff and received top-notch service. We started off with drinks and I must say the horchata was one of the best! We were also treated to some frozen margaritas and nachos to start. My little one ordered a Chilorio Quesadilla and absolutely loved it! I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas and they were also delicious!! We of course couldn't leave without dessert and had the chocolate cake as well as the tres leches. Super tasty!! This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever tried, and I definitely would recommend it to anyone living in or visiting the Vancouver area!! :)"},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Great place to have lunch!

It came with a choice of three types of fish and a choice of bagel, as well as capers, spreads, and plenty of fresh veg.  I chose the house-made gravlax, nova, and whitefish salad, all of which were amazing (especially the gravlax), and my whole wheat bagel was very fresh and perfectly toasted.  The portions were also quite generous, with enough of the fish and accompaniments to assemble some heaping bagel creations and still have some leftover, which I rolled in lettuce to keep the party going.  By the end of the meal I had cleaned my plate completely, with not a scrap of food left except a lemon rind.\\n\\nAfter my two visits, and considering the food I sampled from my friends' plates as well as what I ordered for myself, I think Zaftigs can be hit-or-miss, with some dishes being knockouts and others being pretty ho-hum.  Even our waitress, when we asked her if she would recommend the quiche for example, frankly admitted that their quiche wasn't the best and redirected us to other items on the menu.  I appreciated her candor, and maybe it takes some trial and error to figure out the menu, but I definitely view the place much more favorably after the second visit."},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Brunched here this morning, as I've tried their lunch/dinner in the past and have always been impressed with the food and service.

The omelettes were just egg discs folded over the toppings, the home fries could have used more seasoning and a lot more crispness, and everything was just luke warm. The waitress was very friendly but was not super vigilant about checking in/getting coffee refills/etc. Can't beat the prices though, especially for the area. \\n\\nI'd recommend for a reasonable lunch/dinner (they also have a great drink selection), though I think there are better breakfast places out there."},{"name":"Gyroscope","address":"305 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"First time in this place and WOW!
