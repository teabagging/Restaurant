Fresh food was brought out onto the buffet at least once while we were there.  That's when to score French toast with plenty of powdered sugar!  The stuffed avocados and bacon were apparently quite tasty because they disappeared off plates with a quickness.\\n\\nI've seen others here comment that they had trouble with service.

It has free valet parking too!\\n\\nDetails: The Apron is really a hidden gem in Richmond's new Westin Hotel. Bright greens and yellows paired with dark brown hues welcome you into the dining area. The servers were courteous and friendly, very knowledgeable and fun, it made the dining experience even better!\\n\\nThe chef specializes in molecular gastronomy, a very trendy (and truly spectacular) scientific way to cook and prepare foods by studying physical and chemical processes that affect the ingredients. Dishes created are absolutely delicious, artistic, and leaves you wanting for more since there seems to never be enough!\\n\\nI took a look at their menu and just wanted to order everything! So we ordered the lobster globe, scallops, and their famous puffed foie gras as appies; lamb shank and sablefish for entrees; and matcha green tea mousse and baked apple tart.\\n\\nAn amuse-bouche was brought to awaken our taste buds and it was really interesting! A small little cup filled with avocado foam, topped with a mini cucumber, carrot, fresh mint leaf and shaved popcorn. Yes popcorn! The taste and textures was really refreshing, a clever creation!\\n\\nThe appies came all at once and it was like 3 pieces of artwork.  The lobster was rolled into a ball, hence the name 'globe', with a delicious seafood reduction sauce, gnocchi and oyster mushrooms. The scallops were seared just right, with a bed of basmati rice and light curry. The puffed fois gras was really something new, no clue how the chef made it, but paired with port jelly, beets and baked pastry. It was so good! The port jelly had a squirt of liquid inside a very thin shell, what a nice touch!\\n\\nEntrees are just as perfect, lamb fell off the bones, fish was done just right, need I say more? 2 more artistic creations are placed before us, green tea mousse, lychee foam, coconut ice cream, and baked black sesame sponge. Hmmm....! Need more mousse! The apple tart is not your usual 'apple pie with ice cream', this had a honey ice cream, with open faced cinnamon apple inside a round light pastry, and rose marshmellows!! What an excellent way to top off the meal.\\n\\nI just fell in love with the food here, I will have to come back to try all the other dishes, or the 5-, 7-, 9-course set dinners!

Very tasty, but small.\\n\\nTacos were also a tad pricey at roughly $4 a pop.  The mahi-mahi BLT was unique and fresh.  Tender fish, flavorful bacon, and a nice zesty sauce made a good combination.  The coffee brisket taco with chipotle-horseradish was tasty, but nothing really stood out besides the beefy and tangy sauce.\\n\\nThe enchiladas were done very well, but they definitely could've used more chicken.  The inside was primarily potatoes, and the chicken was pretty much nonexistent.  The filling was complemented with perfectly crisp tortillas and a delicious habanero cream sauce.  The best value at $11 because it comes with rice and beans.  The anise flavored black refried beans were really tasty.  The bacon-studded borracho black beans were a bit strong on the beer flavor, so stick with the refried blacks.\\n\\nSolid new-wave Mexican food, but I would like my portions a bit larger."},{"name":"Amici's","address":"451 High St","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"Fresh and very tasty pizza.

The lamb curry was absolutely delicious...the butter chicken was too sweet for me, but I don't know, never had butter chicken before. Two things put me off about the food 1: no naan bread was provided. I had to pay an extra $1.50 for a medium size of naan bread that wasn't enough for both of us. 2.

We had a good view up until people started gathering on the wrap around porch which obstructed our view. They actually play the narration of the fireworks inside the restaurant so technically you can stay seated and eat. But we opted to walk outside to watch the fireworks, we could still hear the narration outside. It was a great view, I really enjoyed it. We were celebrating a birthday and they brought a complimentary cheesecake with almond crust. It was a nice touch. We also ordered coffee. They serve it in a French press. It was really good. \\nWhen we booked the reservation they mentioned there was a dress code. Being that this restaurant is  at the Grand Floridian, it only made sense. They said we had to wear collared shirts and shoes. No sneakers. Despite this warning, we saw people dining in shorts and flip flops.

(Next is Buchanan's - and they are 2nd by a good margin and closer to average prices).  The price at Precision Pours is an outlier, and it's why I don't go here very often.  I can get really good coffee in other places for roughly half the price.  But if you're willing to explore and splurge, this might be the place for you.  This is luxury coffee.\\n\\nAnd I get the economics.  It's a tiny little shop and he's promoting really high priced coffees and he has to compete with 2 local in-house roasters.  Luckily his location is near a wealthy neighborhood, but the real-estate is still small.  Will this place survive 20 years?  Well you better just get a cup right now or you'll miss out.\\n\\nLastly, I have the impression - albeit I may be completely wrong - that Precision Pours specializes in lighter roasts.

Our best guess was two horribly bland vanilla muffin tops glued together by that white, set-your-teeth-on-edge filling). \\n\\nAt a whopping  $23 per dozen, it's clear Revolution thinks quite highly of themselves. I have been known to spend more, like 2 each (had to think of the husband, right?) of 36 flavors of macaron at Patisserie Vanille at Chicago's French Market was a $60+ splurge that, while a once-in-a-lifetime thing, it was one purchase that I will always consider completely justified. The difference is that Vanille deserved its reputation. These glazed hunks of concrete don't.\\n\\nI've rarely ever encountered food so bad that I had to trash it, but my husband and I (doughnut-lovers, both) agreed it was better to toss the remaining eight of that dozen than eat them (we each tried one cake and one yeast doughnut apiece), we won't be going back.

You have to order sandwiches and bagels from the right, then take your order info to the left, where you can pay and order the other menu items. Because of this mess, they missed our hotdoggle on the order. But after passing the cinnamon buns we were happy it was forgotten, and opted for one of them instead.\\n\\nWe shared a pumpkin bagel with (a MOUND of) cream cheese and the cinnamon bun. The cream cheese was a little much, and next time I think I'd opt for straight up butter so the bagel doesn't get lost. The cinnamon bun was out of this world! You know the disappointment you get when you order a cinnamon bun and it's a sad, bland coil of dry pastry lost under some crusty old icing? Not these puppies. They are fresh, soft, delicate and buttery, and a caramelized topping replaces the standard crusty white icing top. \\n\\nThe prices are decent, $3 for the sweet buns, $6-$12 for a sandwich.

Alcohol will run you around $6 for a beer, $8-10 for a glass of wine, and $10 for a cocktail. Dishes ranged from $12 Lincoln cheeseburger (which looked divine!) to around $18 - 23 for an entree.

Doesn't even much resemble a cafe. It's a full-service restaurant with table service (no self-service) that feels more like a trendy wine bar than anything. There's a counter, but since it's facing the bar, it just feels like a bar. I think the owners liked the retro concept of \\"cafeteria\\" but perhaps did not really understand what the word implies.The decor is simple -- not quite industrial, but still a little cold for the warmth and comfort that the word, \\"cafe\\" would imply. There are separate lunch and dinner menus, so it's really more of a bistro.\\n\\nThe food is good. A small menu and the presentation is attractive but not at all cafeteria, cafe, or even diner-like. The plates have an artisan kind of presentation that only became common in the last 20 years or so. Emphasis on verticle placement and vibrant food color combinations against stark-white china.\\n\\nI think I'd like Blue Star more if it didn't call itself a cafeteria. It feels like they're co-opting the 'plain folks' term which should imply a huge menu with little to no service (some even rely on vending machines) at a cheap price with no separate menus, bar or even wine served. There's something patronizing about a place trying to pass for the domain of the common man on their sign, but not following through on that promise once one walks through the door. It's the pretense I dislike.\\n\\nThe last time I ate there, I ordered a Martini and they served it with salad olives which are about the grossest thing I can think of putting in a Martini. Had the meatloaf (and I've ordered it before) but this time it was a little crusty -- not inedible, but not something I probably would have plated if I'd been in the kitchen. The broccoli was cooked perfectly with a delicious butter sauce and I liked the mushroom gravy on the mashed potatoes. \\n\\nBlue Star is a safe choice for dinner before a show with a friend or a meetup with a client or casual acquaintance.

Why? I can understand the shallot confiture, which is commonly served as an accompaniment in France. I think most people who order foie gras order it because they love foie gras. The foie, shallot confit and brioche bread are enough. I was VERY pleased with the preparation of the foie gras, which all too often ends up a seared, jelly-like mass on a plate. It is wonderful when it is poached as they do at Little Bird. \\n\\nThe sweetbreads were overcooked. Seemed to me they were deep fried. Sad to say, they reminded me of Chicken McNuggets. Better to be sauteed. Again, as with the pear jam and the foie gras, the bread with the sweetbreads is a wasted accompaniment. Mushrooms, sauce, sweetbreads. Keep it simple. Sweetbreads are a tricky, delicate thing to cook, and overcooking them is a real shame - a waste of a fine product.\\n\\nEscargot: very tasty with the gougere and the sauce, but the unpleasant parsley salad is, again, unnecessary. Both myself and my dining companion pushed the unpleasant salad to the side of the plate. The chef would be well advised to take a look at the plates coming back into the kitchen. However, kudos for the nicely cooked escargot which are way too often rubbery. \\n\\nCrab - celery rood salad is tasty. Perhaps a bit too spicy, which can kill the delicate flavor of the crab, which was the case. I can never understand the point of serving some type of spicy sauce with crab, with its delicate flavor. Might as well just serve processed krab. A better choice with the remoulade would be shrimp (the way it is frequently served in New Orleans), since the stronger flavor of shrimp can hold up better with a spicy remoulade. \\n\\nThe bone marrow was very nice and very tasty with the toasted bread. But I found the orange marmalade to be again, the out-of-place item on the plate. \\n\\nIt seems \\"le hamburger\\" is one of the most popular items here. But what's with the Lagouile knife stuck in it? Very strange, and very un-French. Cutlery belongs on the table, please. \\n\\nBy all means, do NOT order the Chateau LaBrande 2005 Cotes de Castillion Bordeaux. A tannic bomb that, even after being decanted, NEVER smooths out to a drinkable state. Some of these Bordeaux wines need to be cellered for about a decade before they are drinkable and this is certainly one of those. l was glad I brought a bottle of wine I like (Marc Bredif 2007 Chinon). I would have been much better off having a bottle of the house pour Bordeaux, the Chateau Buisson Redon 2007. I explained to the bartender about how bad the LaBrande was, to absolutely no avail. I got the old sidestepping \\"the customer is wrong\\" attitude, along with some ludicrous explanation that some people have different taste in wine, blah, blah, blah. That's really lousy customer service. It wouldn't have put the restaurant in the hole to offer at least a glass of the house pour for myself and my companion to make up for someone's BAD decision of putting a really BAD bottle of wine  on the list.\\n\\nI worry when I go into a restaurant and order an unpleasant wine like the LaBrande, about whether it is a reflection on the whole wine list. Is anyone actually tasting these wines on the list? I've been to hundreds of restaurants where there was a huge amount of care that went into the list and how the wine paired with the food, and EVERYONE on the staff, from the dishwasher to the chef, knew the wines. With all the thousands of wines on the market now there should never be a mediocre bottle on any restaurant's list."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"What can I say about Neptune Oyster that hasn't already been said.

Not overly impressed with the lobster roll, but at $25, I guess it's a good value.

Though not being much of a \\"martini\\" drinker, I conformed to peer pressure and got a Cosmo.

I have tried many things here, and yet it is is still a low percentage of the total available menu items: The tandoori chicken tasted like goodness itself, the samosas are not good if filled with meat, but quite good if filled with other food matter, the naan (expecially the dessert naan) evokes perceptions of bliss, and ooh la laaa do I covet any items containing marinaded lamb's flesh. Eat The Food here!\\n\\nAlso like how I presume India to be is The Waitstaff: some do not speak to you (this is in a non-rude manner!), others do speak to you but for the purpose of divining your order (marinaded lamb, please!), and others are rude because they are not Indian and exist behind the bar desiring large gratuities because they bare large portions of their chest. Yuck! Remember: they are available for delivery service, and Bobby is the pinnacle of delivery.\\n\\nNext I will discuss The Odors: watch out!

It was on a bed of onions which seemed a touch epic but the fish was very good. My husband got the pork cognac plum stew with lentils, charred scallion and Dijon vinaigrette which was also amazing.

The chunks were gigantic and juicy. The big difference was that Neptune's roll was much more \\"au naturel\\"; the hot bun was buttered, but the lobster meat itself tasted very pure and fresh. The fries were awesome, too. \\n\\nI can tell I'm going to have dreams of Neptune's lobster roll; one of these mornings, I'm going to wake up with drool all over my pillow.

Our table was wobbly which is unexpected considering they just opened.  They should be on top of things like that.\\n3.  I was brought the wrong beer.

They nickle and dime you a bit on the sides.  For example, if you want to add a dollop of mascarpone to your polenta, it's 3 bucks extra.\\n6.

It looks terribly faded even up close.  The sign on the door does NOT say \\"Little Bird\\", at least, in English.  The door is clearly stenciled \\"petite ouiseau\\".  If you, like me, don't read French you might not step inside.  Go ahead.  Step inside.  The ambiance is bright, clean, and quiet.\\n\\nMy Partner-In-Dine (PID) and I had dinner here one evening last week.  First, the service.  Excellent.  No question.  Excellent.  Attentive without being intrusive.  No empty plates or unanswered questions.  Fresh bread cut at the side board then, instantly brought to the table.  We were immediately presented with perfect tough crusted, tender centered, airy Italian bread.  The butter accompanying this was fresh, room temp (THANK YOU for not freezing silver foil wrapped patties or frozen cutey-pie balls!!), clean, sweet cream butter.  These two things alone nearly ended me.\\n\\nIt is a terrible thing not to be able to decide which dish to have for dinner.  It is only made worse when the appetizer options are so overwhelming.  Luckily, they offer a sampler like option.  The best option for us that evening was the \\"Charcuterie Board\\"=Foie Gras Br√ªl√©e, apricot-sauternes jam OMG!!!\\nDuck Rillette, pickled red onions (feh)\\nCured Pork Loin (Melt in your mouth)\\nChicken Liver Mousse, truffled shallots (Beyond OMG!)\\nLamb Cheek Pastrami, dijon vinaigrette do it. (Just G!)\\n\\nThe only thing I did not really like was the Duck Rillette.  Rillette is SO OVER.  It just makes tender tasty meat vinegary and tough.  I have no idea why PDX likes this so much.  I keep tying it and no matter where I go it is always the same.  Tough, stringy, and vinegary.  This is a terrible waste when it is pork and worse when it's duck.  I totally LOVE duck made just about every other way.\\n\\nEverything else on the Board was ridiculous.  The lightly fried pork \\"cheek\\" with creme fraiche and something green was so mild and melty it nearly passed from existence before I had a chance to place the fork into my mouth and round my lips around the morsel.  The pate' was superb, and the rest ('cept for the Rillette) was spectacular!\\n\\nMy PID had the Chicken Fried Trout.  This thing took up his entire plate.  He could not stop eating once he tucked in.  I had the equally special Hanger Steak Frites, chermoula, watercress, harissa cr√®me fra√Æche.  I ordered my steak medium rare.  It came to me so incredibly perfect I barely needed teeth to chew.  The flavors were like many different smooth butters swirling in my mouth.\\n\\nWe were so full there was not even a possibility of dessert.  It didn't help that we had tickets to an event.  Normally, two hours would have been more than enough time to enjoy each others company, appetizer, and our meals along with dessert.  Not so.\\n\\nWe just may have to come back for a dessert only meal.  Sounds incredible doesn't it?  Now, I just have to pose the possibility to my favorite PID.  I am pretty sure he will insist on all the pre-dessert offerings, too."},{"name":"FoMu","address":"481 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"Got peanut butter ice cream at FoMu.

I came here on a Saturday morning and the line was almost out the door. But since it was my first time ordering breakfast and all, it gave me some time to think about what I wanted to order instead of awkwardly blinking at the cashier. Anyways, I ordered an iced coffee with vanilla and the half size apple-wood smoked bacon sandwich. At first, they didn't have any sticky buns, but I was told that they would have it out later. I really like this location because it has more seating that the other ones, and everything is all spread out. I like how you can see the menu clearly as well as all of the pastries that they offer. And I'm glad a cafe finally has alternative milks for people to pour themselves out on the bar! \\n\\nAnyways, I got my order relatively fast and luckily found a seat with my friend. The sandwich was amazing!! I just wish I ordered a full sandwich, but that's okay because the half sandwich filled me up. The coffee was okay, I didn't really taste any vanilla when I asked for that. I just like how I could put in my own amount soy milk since I'm lactose intolerant. After I finished my breakfast, I went up to order sticky buns and they were finally out!! They looked divine. I ordered one for here and another to-go. Along with that, I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was pretty good, but I don't think it's worth the price. You could probably find a thicker ooey gooey mess of a cookie somewhere else without spending $3. The sticky buns though were pretty amazing! They lived up to their hype. I'll admit though, that they are a little too sweet for my liking, but every now and then, it will seem to heal that craving that you might have for a sweet bun. \\n\\nAll in all, I can't wait to be back to try other sandwiches and desserts!!

They have smaller portion Kebabs which seem to be a hit.  If you've had a chance to look at the menu and can't make up your mind I'd say the Kebabs are a safe bet.  \\n\\nI've had a few different dishes and although I do like them I don't think they are stellar.  My opinion is that they are cooking some of my favorite dishes in large batches a couple times a week.  \\n\\nThe moussaka is decent, however the 2 times I've gotten it the middle was cold while the outside was warm.  I'm sure I'd order this more often if it was piping hot.  \\n\\nThe meatloaf is pretty much the same deal as the moussaka, somewhat tasty but seems to be hit or miss on the temperature.  It's also covered in a very bland red sauce.  This dish has serious potential to be top notch but never seems to deliver anything better than average.\\n\\nI've had the Gyro here and it's pretty much your standard frozen meat heated on the grill.   Not the traditional Gyro you would find cooking on a spit soaking up wonderful juices from fat.\\n\\nIt's a family restaurant and certainly has that feel to it.  When you are done eating you can just leave your dishes on the table and someone comes around and picks them all up.  \\n\\nThe decor is old and dreary but I think that's the look they are going for.  It's clean and the tables are always wiped down.  \\n\\nThe staff is friendly and in my opinion is the reason they got the 3rd star on this review.\\n\\nThis place is in my weekly lunch rotation.  I think it's because we eat a lot of Asian food and this is something different.  I'm sure my coworkers like it here more than I do.

I've always had my suspicions but I definitely saw it crystal clear today. He scooped out 2 full scoops of steak...yes, 2 whole scoops...to the lady in front of me; but only gave me half a scoop. It was such an obvious difference in treatment, I felt like he was passively telling me to never come back or something. Being a regular customer for the last 3 years, I felt pretty betrayed and discriminated. I've never been so upset with Chipotle before. \\n\\nConclusion: if you're an Asian American Chipotle fanatic, do not go to this branch.

However, our experience was so above and beyond our expectations it has remained in my mind and I was waiting for an opportunity to give as stellar of a review as they deserve.\\n\\nMy husband and I got married in Boston this past summer (July 2017). We held our rehearsal dinner at Porto, and from the second the decision was made, until the moment our evening ended we had a perfect experience with Porto and all of the staff there. \\n\\nWe worked most closely with Tim (manager) and Kimmy (event specialist) and they were phenomenal. We were given the entire backroom (our event had about 20 people, but this room can hold more), we were able to select our menu offerings, our drink menu, had two servers dedicated to us for the entire night who didn't miss a beat, we were able to design and play our own playlist of music, and help design the layout of the room. \\n\\nTim and Kimmy were SO helpful in offering their assistance from beginning to end-- in the design of the menu with delicious seasonal offerings, to helping us decide which wines would be best to offer (Tim suggested a rose that was one of the best I've ever had!). We would swing in unannounced to work on the planning, and were always met with a smile and a seat at the bar for discussions.\\n\\nWhen the evening came together everything went seamlessly. Our family and friends raved about the restaurant itself, the decor and style, the food, the drinks and the service over and over again-- several of those who lived in town having never been to Porto before said that they would absolutely be returning on their own. \\n\\nI cannot rave enough about Porto and the lovely folks who work there.

If you arrive there around dinner time, you go stand in line and order (not unlike McDonalds) and then they charge you a 16% tip at the time you order, and then you go find a table and wait for them to bring it out to you.  When I was there it was pretty clear that a tip paid in advance did not do much to incent the server, and it did a fair amount to incense me.\\n\\nThe food was decent, although the menu was a bit shallow... the fries were good and the Greek salad was generous with feta but stingy with everything else, having on a meager slice of tomato and a lonely, sad Kalamata olive lurking under a slice of iceberg.  The chicken rice soup was as good as I could make at home if I poured a half a cup of lemon juice in it, and the chicken salad was meaty and tasty but arrived ten minutes after I had finished the Greek salad that I was supposed to put it on.  Hmmmmm....\\n\\nIt's not cheap enough to excuse the bad service and the food's adequate but not really good enough to compensate for the lack of variety on the menu.

Com Grille is not the typical Vietnamese restaurant with various types of Pho.  Actually, they don't have pho at all.  Instead, they have a very yummy green papaya, apple, green mango combination salad that you can get with either grilled shrimp, chicken, beef, lamb, etc.  So far I've had it only with the grilled shrimp and it was very good.  The shrimp was well seasoned and cut into small bite size pieces. The long, thinly cut unripe fruit added great firm, but not crispy, texture to the salad without adding too much to the flavor. The dressing was mildly sweet.  Thin, stringy onion rings were on top of the salad.  All these ingredient mixed together made a very fresh and tasty combination salad enough as an appetizer for two.\\nIf you don't get the salad then I would recommend one of the grape leave wraps.  You can choose from beef, chicken, lamb, tofu, etc.  So far I've had the lamb and beef.  Both were very good.  They kind of look like grape leaf egg rolls.  The flavor of the meats in the rolls were excellent.  Also enough for two as an appetizer.\\nFor the main dish I have only ordered the flat rice vermicelli with beef with rice paper wraps.  You will get a plate of rice vermicelli fried together into cut pancake-like structure with cooked, semi-sweet marinated beef. You will also get a separate plate of fresh vegetables and herbs such as cilantro, basil, mint, red leaf lettuce, etc. Put a little bit of each item in a rice paper wrap and you have yourself a very fresh and tasty summer roll that you can dip in the sweet chili sauce they give you.

One of the things that makes me look forward to my experience at Disney World the most is the food. From personal experience, the less able I am to pronounce a restaurant's name, the more fancy it is. \\"MUH LUH NO\\", as I call it, appeared to be just what I was looking for. After a long day of travel, my family and I chose this restaurant to start off our adventure. As if the Florida heat did not shock my body enough and make the hairs on my llama fur vest start to curl from the humidity; walking into Mulino, was worse than walking into the freezer in the grocery store while grabbing my favorite boxed wine. It is cold in this restaurant people... so make sure to bring a turtle neck. Through my teeth chattering, I ordered the rigatoni con fungi, and was soon given bread, eggplant and salami as an appetizer. As for the bread, I can't say I was overwhelmed, yet wasn't disappointed... so we'll give it a solid \\"whelmed\\", the eggplant tasted like cat barf. And while I'm at it I'm just going to say the service was great, but it kind of irritated me that they filled up my water faster than I could finish it. I took it as a challenge and drank, I bet, a gallon of water total until they finally stopped being so attentive to my hydration needs. If anyone is still reading this (because they're stuck in an elevator or something) I bet you're wondering how the actual food was.  Let's just say I don't think the chef went to college because in college all people know how to make us mac and cheese, boiling noodles being a huge part of that advanced skill set. The noodles were not cooked properly almost to the point of being crunchy, and he mushrooms in my rigatoni could pass as sardines with the amount of salt they had on them. \\"Good flavors but bad execution\\" (sounds like something Padma from Top Chef would say). For dessert, the pistachio ice cream was delicious and the coffee was as strong as Dwayne Johnson. but if you've got money to burn and are craving sub par Italian food paired with sublime dessert, please do come to this fine establishment."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent food, nice place, decent service.

Spanning three rooms, I was able to witness Rothko's evolution as an artist spanning a decade; the CMA hosts 37 Rothko works of art until May 26th, 2013. \\n\\nI also particularly enjoyed the European art exhibit. One painting stood out - a portrait of a beautiful young woman painted by a traveler hundreds of years ago as payment to the girls family for a place to stay. The young woman is dressed in a Greek robe, which I learned was the fashion for that particular place and time. She reminded me of someone I once knew - which is awe-inspiring to say the least, given the time span.\\n\\nI like that there were opportunities for children and adults alike to create art - several tables and projects were available, resulting in a collaborative effort from the museums' many visitor's. The place wasn't packed, and I was able to find a parking spot, but there were plenty of people there.\\n\\nFinally, as I made my way back to my car I passed through an auditorium as a jazz band was auditioning a new singer.

High ceilings with tin tiles (or apparently so). Long, narrow room with a balcony over the bar and kitchen. Very Victor/Victoria.\\n\\nService was spot-on: at the elbow when we needed her; friendly without getting chummy, except when we initiated it; never doing the stupid \\"is everything okay?\\" sort of questions.\\n\\nSince this was our last dinner in town, we went a little off our usual beat. Yes, of course we went for the charcuterie plate; where would the title of this post have been without that? Excellent, lots of flavor, etc., etc. Definitely recommended.\\n\\nBut where we went off course a bit was the second appetizer: marrow bones.\\n\\nOh, my.\\n\\nIf you've never had marrow bones and you are not vegetarian: get over it! You are missing out on a hidden treasure. Yes, it's fatty, but you're not making a meal of it, just enough to soak into some crusty bread. This course was also served with a little apricot preserves, which nicely mellowed into that warm fattiness of the marrow. It was a special, but highly recommended if it's up when you are there.\\n\\nMains: She had the cauliflower cr√™pe, I had the hanger steak. The hanger steak was excellent, a nice, juicy piece served over a blue cheese souffl√©, which would have been dry by itself but worked nicely with the juice from the steak. But it was Her cr√™pe that was the clear winner. Layers of chopped cauliflower, caramelized onions, egg, and mornay sauce, layered with crepes, then broiled until crispy on top. I am not normally drawn to meatless mains, but in this case, I might make an exception.\\n\\nFor desserts we had the pear tarte tatin and the bonbons de la maison. The pear tarte tatin is a very good tarte tatin, and the blue cheese ice cream is only vaguely blue cheese-flavored, so don't let that put you off it.

I believe those are the best two words to describe Rose & Crown Pub. With all that real estate on Epcot, why can't they make this pub a bit more larger? It's by far one of the most crowded places to grab a beverage and quick bite in all of Disney. \\n\\nSpecialty cocktails start from $9 and up.\\n\\nScotch Whiskey starts at $12.\\n\\nAles, lagers, stouts, and blends start at $8.50.\\n\\nThe food isn't to die for. The fish and chips are okay. The fish is pretty meaty and each bite isn't a bite of excessive greasy oily batter which is good. There's always an old lady entertaining the crowd with her piano. It's fun at first, but if you plan on sitting in for a long period, it starts to get annoying. I've been here twice, my first experience was much calmer maybe because we stopped by during the day. Our second experience, we came at night. The pub was jammed pack. Parents who brought their children in here was a complete nightmare of a experience. The drunks at the bar were already loud enough to compliment the loud piano lady, then on top of that you had screaming toddlers with parents simply didn't care anymore. We stepped in for a few short minutes and literally stepped right out and walked over to the Yorkshire County Fish Shop which serves the same fish and chips serving to the folks inside of Rose & Crown pub.\\n\\nVerdict - It all depends on how you plan on starting your day at Epcot. We started on the west side of the World Showcase at Mexico. Our last destination was the United Kingdom. By the time we got there, it was roughly around dinner time. I would recommend starting from East to West. Make the UK your first attraction at the World Showcase. I rather start my day off at Epcot by drinking early in the morning (if you plan on going when gates open) with my fish and chips at a calm and half empty pub instead of a night riot style dinner/quick meal.

I guess it would have been fine if I had expected to spend half the night there. The food itself was fine... above average, even.. but the service was beyond atrocious. I'll never go back.

Parking can be challenging on a weekend or weeknight.  You may have to fight/go to war to get a nice window table, but even at the bar you can gaze out and woo your date(s). \\n\\nOrdered the Kung Pao Calamari, which was around $6 (everything on the HH menu is between $5-8, with a house white/red @$5, and a bottle for $24) I've never had calamari in this presentation, which was in a rice batter and somewhat clumped together, but the sweet-spicy sauce and the calamari worked well together, its not the usual drier crispy bar-food style, and is a different style dish, and a good one to order.\\n\\nThe flat iron steak with pommes frites was worth it for $6, the steak was about a 4-6oz cut, but was very tender for such a basic cut of meat, the seasoning is minimal, but it has a satisfying meaty flavor without being drowned in the cream based sauce. The fries also came with a bit of minced garlic to give them some flavor.\\n\\nThe Crab cakes were very rich with crab and had a nice buttery flavor, and also had a high quality crab taste and were not fishy at all, nor dry. If you like crab cakes, this is a good one to try.\\n\\nThe basil chicken was actually surprisingly flavorful and came served on a bed of rice, not very spicy or basil-y but it did have a complex enough flavor to not taste at all like an afterthought of a dish. \\n\\nAlso ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Tartare, which lacked much flavor, and really didn't seem seared at all, i was expecting whole sliced tuna, but its actually a mound of minced ahi, dressed with some mango pieces and rice crackers.  I would avoid this dish, as it was the only one that was not finished.  \\n\\nI ate all of these dishes, and felt fat and guilty at the end of the night, but it was worth it!

I have never been impressed by their customer service, but then again I have high expectations. I usually order on my way to this store so I don't have to wait. Sadly the last three times I have had to wait longer than customers who placed their orders in store. I am patient though and that is just the first thing. When their is a specific woman working I can always expect that my order is wrong or that I am waiting. She is also not polite. I like to order the Matcha Lemonade, but sometimes people make it incorrectly resulting in dry clumped powder at the bottom of the cup. And drinking chunks of Matcha powder is not what I came for. I also don't understand why they offer light ice as an option. I will say this has only become an issue in the last six months. I just left with my order and the cup was filled with 75% ice. I order about 2-3 drinks a week and I would say two out of three times they don't see this note. I also don't like that even though I order online and they will know orders are there that they don't look up or check to see if anyone is waiting at the counter. I typically have to get someone's attention. They will even walk away and not even make eye contact, resulting in me having to flag someone down.

I don't quite remember what they were (this was awhile ago), but I remember that the taste was mediocre. It was slightly icy and while it didn't taste like coconut, it didn't taste like the flavors it was supposed to either. The chocolate sauce was oversweet and completely unnecessary, but that was our bad for adding it.\\n\\nAs someone who is paleo (aka dairy free as part of it, and am lactose intolerant anyway), I've had better vegan ice creams (notably, ones made from cashew milk). However, I definitely would give this place another try, albeit by myself, so I can try either flavors with nuts in them or the more unique flavors that she wasn't quite down to try.

Every time we enter, the smiling hostess and servers passing by greet us cheerily. Our water and tea are always promptly refilled. When my friend and I leave, we are given equally cheery farewells. \\n\\nAs for the food, it's decent. If you've never been to Kamei, I honestly don't recommend going there, given all the cheap sushi joints you have here. I've been a patron for about two years, and I have noticed that the portions get smaller and the prices increase.  They also revamp their menu on occasion, and I find it somewhat disorganized. They've removed my favourite dish: Colossal Cheese Yakitori, which was basically chicken skewers on a bed of mashed potatoes, smothered in cheese. Try the Thunder Fries (yam tempura fries), which comes with an interesting deep-fried cheese roll and delicious dipping sauce.\\n\\nThe sushi itself is okay. I've had comparable take-away sushi from T&T and from the sushi place in the Royal Centre (just across from Kamei). The California roll is really bland, and I tend to use copious amounts of wasabi and soy sauce. It helps clear my sinuses, at least?\\n\\nMy favourite part of my meals there is dessert. I tend to order the Cr√®me Brul√©e Cheesecake. It's neat because the server will caramelize the topping with a blow torch.

As such, I had high hopes when I suggested it to my mother who flew in to Boston to celebrate Mother's Day. Everything I'd heard about Neptune's was about the same: \\"it's worth the wait.\\"\\n\\nI'd hoped that by arriving around 6, we'd beat the dinner rush, but even so we were told that the wait for a party of two was 45 minutes. We wandered the North End a bit, but spent a majority of our 1 hour and 15 minute wait huddled inside the Neptune entrance. When seated, we ordered a dozen Cherrystone clams, the hamachi ceviche, and the gold coast red snapper. My mother asked for a hot water with lemon, her customary drink order, but was informed that hot beverages were not an option. From what I could surmise, the beverage selection ranges from wine to water and nothing in between.\\n\\nThere's no question that our food was absolutely delicious. The clams, with lemon and sauces, were delightful. The ceviche, though not what expected (it was really more along the lines of strips of fish with sauces laid on a plate) was lovely, and the red snapper was one of the tastiest dishes I've had in some time. I rate Neptune Oyster only 2 stars because the food, while delicious, did not make up for the exaggerated wait time, the cramped and noisy seating situation, the lack of choices, and the high prices.

So, after two years things have seriously declined, but the price of brunch has risen to a ridiculous $20/adult and $9/children.  Seems like the prices climbed when they added dessert, but honestly the desserts are gross.  Their GF flour blend tastes like it has bean flour in it.  Don't do that...  Baked sweet goods should not be made with bean flour even if it's mixed with other flours.  Bean flour makes for a pretty good texture, but you can get a good texture with the right flour blend sans bean flour.  Over the last 3 years of living GF because DD was diagnosed with celiac, I've come to learn a lot.  Your bakers can do better.  Find some new recipes!  There are tons on the web.  Regular weekday meals are so inconsistently cooked.  Pasta will be mush one day, too hard another, but mostly we got mushy pasta every time we went.  There is a general flavor that everything has.  It's hard to put my finger on it, but there is some background flavor that makes everything taste the same and frankly the food doesn't taste good.

As soon as you walk in, you get that wafted smell of delicious meats cooking on the hot stove or that lovely giant log of meat spinning against the heating rod.\\n\\nWhile the food is abundant, its doused by a ton of oil and delicious sauce. It can be heavy but for late night food its really great. They've expanded their seating inside and use to only have basically seating for 10 but now it can seat about 40 inside and there is some patio seating outside.\\n\\nAll in all, a great place for lots of food. I wish they would tone down their oil and season their rice more but I understand how tough it is to serve so many customers. Another critique would be to change up their vegetables more. The lettuce and tomatoes get pretty tiring."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I finally went to Murphy's for brunch on Sunday.

I was hoping for fresh ones to be cooked into the pancakes. Otherwise, the pancakes tasted just the way they should. The third time I got the veggie omelet again and it was much better considering that I came in earlier.

They got their oysters shortly afterwards. \\n\\nOur waitress then took our order for our meal, we ordered the following :\\nFor apps:\\nOne Johnny cake\\nOne clam chowder\\n\\nFor our entrees\\nOne lobster roll (cold)\\nOne cioppino\\nOne Bottarga Vongole\\n\\nWhen my sister enquired about the Bottarga Vongole, she asked the waitress if the dish was linguini based. The waitress looked unsure and said she would check. We googled and it showed up as a clam linguini dish so we ordered it. \\n\\nOur drinks arrived but not our oysters. The couple next to us finished their oysters and then got their Johnny cake. After they finished that, they got their lobster rolls. All in a sequence. \\n\\nWhat happened to us was a disaster. Our entrees arrived first. They removed the covers from the hot dishes. We were surprised as we hadn't even been served our oysters or apps yet! When my sister saw her Bottarga Vongole, she was surprised, there was no pasta... just some Israeli style couscous. We asked the waitress. Her reaction was to correct her and say that \\"that is pasta, it's called pearl pasta\\". No apology. No offer to swap it. No smile. Nothing. She only ate the clams and didn't touch anything else. She was charged $35 for the dish. \\n\\n3 minutes after our entrees were served, our oysters arrived. 2 minutes after that, our clam chowder and Johnny cake arrived. We couldn't believe what was happening. The couple next to us got everything in sequence with a gap between their dishes and we had to make the choice to eat everything at once to avoid things getting cold. The experience was so unpleasant. We were all quiet, no one was talking. I was embarrassed. This was the meal we'd been waiting for all year and it was awful. We couldn't enjoy it.\\n\\nAnd this is just half the story! I left the restaurant feeling fine and around 1.5/2 hours later started feeling unwell. We had to rush home after I started getting severe stomach cramps. I was sick all afternoon and all night basically spending all my time in the bathroom and in my bed. My sister and her husband had to go out alone on Saturday night and I had to cancel our plans that night. \\n\\nThis whole experience was an utter disappointment given the reputation of your restaurant and the $250 bill we paid in full.\\nPS.

Needless to say, our preconceptions were completely wrong.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar and were promptly greeted by Brandon.  We explained it was our first time there as he welcomed us.  He gave us the normal special run-down, told us about the things he loves on the menu and we discussed how everything is made from scratch, in-house.  We started with drinks and the guacamole - hands-down the best guac we've ever had.  Since it was restaurant week, we opted for that menu, splitting (yes, we are that couple) the most delicious salad, a melt-in-your-mouth pork chop with cheddar grits and Brussels sprouts, then ended with the chocolate tartlet.  In the end, we were happy we split the meal because as it turns out, portion sizes are quite generous.  \\n\\nWe also had the pleasure of the other bartender, Andrew, tending to our needs.  It wasn't particularly busy at the bar, but the atmosphere was warm and quiet - much different than most places these days.

Clam appetizer (recommended by the server) would have been better if it had been tasteless.    Fried oysters -- thud.   Fish stew, with the exception of a properly cooked piece of fish, was basically slop.  The two (out of 5) bad mussels were a nice touch.  Like Andrea, we had eaten at Rialto  many times over the years and never had a sub-par meal.  Not always distinguished, but solid.  This was a joke -- a bad joke -- on us.  Oh, and dessert.

Honestly at first I was expecting crappy food but was pleasantly surprised that the food was decent considering it was free. What's the catch? Well, the drinks were a bit on the pricey side, but not any pricier than any bar/lounge in Boston.

Upon arriving at Porto for dinner I was pleasantly greeted by a manager and my waiter for the evening, Anthony. I was taken to a great table with a marvelous view of the courtyard and Boylston street, and immediately provided my choice of sparkling or still water, quite refreshing on a hot summers day. Once the waiter, Anthony, had returned he began to reccommend me several types of wine and let me taste each for me to see which I enjoyed the most (a nice touch). Moving forward I ordered the Raw Tuna as a starter and oh boy, was this the bees knees! The Tuna was extremely fresh and paired perfectly with a lightly crunchy onion topping and complimented by an amazing spicy sauce (whose name escapes me); I was genuinely satisfied with this dish. After that I was reccommended an absolutely mouth-watering and delicious Pesto Campanella plate. The pesto was exploding with flavor and complimented nicely by pine nuts and fresh tomatoes. It was topped with the perfect amount of cheese to finish it off. After that I proceeded to order the Flat Iron steak. Again I was immensely pleased with this dish; it's presentation was beautiful and was cooked to absolute perfection. It was paired perfectly with a light salad and was an overall great plate. The food was all 10/10 here as well as the tableside cocktails made right in front of you. My waiter Anthony's hospitality and knowledge of the menu, and the manager Eric's kindness made my evening a genuinely pleasant experience and left me with a smile on my face.

So less in fact that there's a lot of places that yell and scream \\"Authentic Italian\\", and are really NOT.  I swear to god, nothing bothers me more than a pretentious restaurant.\\n\\nSo i reluctantly, walked backwards and went against my will, I booked a table at The Italian Kitchen.  Why?  I don't know.  I tried so many Italian restaurants and, as said previously, was disappointed very very much.  As much as i swore to never even try an Italian restaurant in BC again.\\n\\nDid I say story short? Nope.  So I went to reserve on-line on Open Table for another restaurant.  And after reading reviews, bad reviews, really bad reviews, I decided to cancel the reservation and I searched for another place.  In the section \\"Best ratings\\", The Italian Kitchen poped up and I clicked on it.  Was it my cerebellum that compelled me to click on it?  Probably.  I had a feeling.\\n\\nThat feeling was right, as soon as we put the pastas to our mouth, the feeling was right!  We had penne arrabbiata and linguine with jumbo prawns.  Both dishes were done perfectly.  To my taste, the linguine had a more refine flavor to it, while the penne arrabiata was more traditionnal.  All in all, the pastas were cooked al dente to the second, and the taste was on the spot.  I did not have good Italian in months.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the service was great, I should even say excellent, hell no, the service was outstanding.  Thanks to our server (and i really hope i get his name right), Aymeric.  Courteous and professional.  Talk about a great experience.  Did i say long story short? Nah!\\n\\nI will definitely go back to Italian Kitchen.  The food and service are outstanding.  But most of all, you can have all this at a more than reasonable price.  Less than 30$ per person.  There is a feeling of care for the customers and a warmth to the place."},{"name":"Thai Pasta Cuisine","address":"11461 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Always fast, and very friendly staff.

Our food was still hot! We ordered the beef empanadas, carne asada tacos, jalape√±o cheese dip, and the Cuatros Leches  for dessert. The beef empanadas were crunchy on the outside and tender and hearty inside. The tacos were topped with fresh avocados (in December!) and were so full of flavor and freshness, although I did add a hint of lime to supplement the pickled onions. The cheese dip wasn't special, but the chips were great and the dip was tasty. Finally, we had the Cuatros Leches cake, which was sweet and nice to try.

Coming from NYC, I do have high expectations for food. Authentic Spanish restaurant is not easy to find anywhere in the states. Overall, jamon Serrano was good and I don't think it needs additional sesame or pepper as the restaurant chose to present it with. I asked the server about paella before ordering to make sure it is somewhat authentic. Unfortunately it came out undercooked. I was not surprised because it typically takes 45 mins and mine came out in less than half an hour. I sent it back and the second time the rice was cooked but it was soupy, not the authentic paella which is crispy on the bottom. The seafood were bland, they appeared to be steamed separately and then put on top of the rice when the rice is done- not the correct way to make paella. The server explained to me that because it is lunch time, they try to accommodate business lunch which requires fast in and out.

No gesture to replace it or anything was made.  Our dinners arrived while we still were eating our app/salad.

Anyone who has served for a short time should be able to pick up on less than pleased guests, which we clearly were.

Filet Mignon with black peppercorn sauce served with sauteed spinach and goat cheese mashed potatoes (reg. $23), Lobster Orchiette Pasta served with an auroa sauce (reg. $18) and more. I ordered the filet mignon which was cooked not at my requested medium rare, but well done. The mashed potatoes were too salty-but really, who can complain at a price like that! With such a deal, you can find yourself waiting at least an hour for a table so prepare to sit at the bar for a drink. \\n\\nDuring the week, the restaurant is empty and I'm guessing its because of their steep prices. I wouldn't dream of paying full price for their mini burgers, one will cost you anywhere from $4.95 to $8 (ridiculous.)

The pulled pork was just the right consistency. They also serve it with 4 different sauces that you can put on yourself if you so choose - hot, mild, sweet, vinegar. I mixed mine with the hot and mild - perfecto! The handcut fries were a bit disappointing I must say. It was definitely a decent sized portion (a big ole bowl), but they were dry, bland, and I am not convinced that they were actually handcut. \\n\\nI do need to give them props for making a to die for piece of cornbread.

Typically we could walk in and get a table, and have a pleasant meal and a chance to visit while still wrapping up in a timely fashion. I tended to favor the turkey sandwich, myself, but my friends ordered a broad variety of things and I can't remember any times when they seemed dissatisfied.\\n\\nHowever, the reason I am writing this review is because I had a really pleasant experience there yesterday, and ordered off the brunch menu for the first time. Quiche Lorraine = YUM!\\n\\nI was having a \\"girl day\\" with one of my friends, and when I found out that she lived really close to Blue Star but hadn't eaten there yet I suggested we try it for brunch. We were able to be seated right away, and got a nice little booth-- but there aren't any really bad seats in there. You can either get a table, a booth, a stool at the bar, or a half-booth/half-table. She commented that the interior was sleek, but not sterile, and I tend to agree. \\n\\nWe got our drinks promptly, and spent a few minutes looking over the menu before settling on our respective choices. She had the turkey sandwich that I usually get (with the macaroni salad side, which she finished off before even touching the sandwich!). I had the quiche with a lovely salad (spring mix, almonds, dried cranberries, feta-- it was delightful and fresh!). I also had a mimosa, which was nicely balanced and a reasonable size. We finished off the meal by sharing a slice of their excellent carrot cake (really moist, with recognizable bits of carrot in the cake and a generous amount of pecans in the icing), and headed out with full tummies and big smiles. \\n\\nA few caveats-- \\n\\n1. They don't have a liquor license (just beer and wine), so if you want a bloody Mary, bring vodka (they sell a lovely set-up there). \\n2. It can get a little noisy since it has very little fabric or partitioning (and the kitchen is pretty much open), so be careful about bringing people with sensitive ears or hearing impairments. \\n3. While there is a parking lot, sometimes it is a little tight, so walking or biking might be a good choice (or, rather, an even better choice). There are a few bike racks near the door. \\n\\nOverall, I really like this place. The food is good, it's cute, and it is in an area of Austin that I really love.

Alexander's Restaurant","address":"4701 Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went here for my birthday dinner. I was a little apprehensive since I had never been before. Place is nice in an upscale chain restaurant kind of way; similar to Houston's. I think this location used to be a Houston's; moreover, I believe J. Alexanders patterns its menu on the Houston's template. I noticed JA has a Maui Steak similar to Houston's Hawaiian Steak. JA also (like Houstons) seems to pigeonhole customers into getting certain side dishes that automatically come with specific entrees with the idea that substitutions are somehow not allowed or frowned upon or at the very least  warrant upcharges / surcharges. \\n\\nWe started off with a calamari appetizer. It was composed entirely of rings (no tentacles). Came with very good fra diavolo sauce and half a lemon and had just the right amount of breading. Again, fried almost perfectly (flash fried?) with a peppery flour breading / coating texture. Very fresh tasting. \\n\\nThe salad course was a bit of a fiasco and / or comedy of errors. The guy who brought out the salads to our table was not properly briefed by the girl who took our orders and he seemed to either not know or not care who got what. So I ended up with a salad that was not the one I ordered. The salad I ended up with was good but the mix up caused problems & addled confusion with my family. Not cool. The waitress tried to rectify the problem afterwards but the damage had already been done.\\n\\nFor my entree I ended up going with the Maui Steak which comes with whipped / mashed potatoes. The steak was a little too sweet  or cloying for my palate (with all the heavy the sauce / pineapple / garlic marinade / MSG) but I ate it anyway. The whipped / mashed potatoes were good too; perhaps better than I expected. Normally I go with a loaded baked potato with my steak at most steak joints.\\n\\nI sampled some of my grandmother's crab cake entree order and, quite frankly, it was one of the best crab cake entrees I have ever tasted. Lots of big chunks of fresh lump crab meat. Big generous order of two large crab cakes. I think it came with slaw and fries. I will return to get that for my next visit. Overall a mixed bag experience but the good seemed to far outweight the bad. J.Alexanders is a little pricey; however, I would say it is worth it if you order correctly.

Oh, a $2000 espresso machine would be cool. Chef Bond should move in and cook for me too.\\n\\nLet's start with the breads, which are more than belly fillers. Each night features four house-baked slices. I was delighted when the waitress described one called \\"the sea,\\" which features kelp and ground shrimp, but this just tasted funky. I wound up preferring the more orthodox selections of 9-grain, spelt, etc.\\n\\nThe menu, which changes daily, features a couple appetizers and a handful of mains that can be ordered as half or full portions. We got the wonderful spice-poached beet with greens and heavenly buttermilk viniagrette to start, followed by three half entrees. Saffron risotto and steelhead salmon came out together. The risotto topped with an amazingly delicate piece of yellowtail flounder was dreamy, but I felt it could have used just a touch more salt to bring everything out. The crispy-skinned salmon was the favorite of the night for both of us, accented with flavor-packed pickled mushrooms. The salmon rested on a bed of something that looked like hummus, though I couldn't place it at all. Turned out it was rutabaga puree, whose mildness perfectly supported the dish's more pronounced flavors.\\n\\nThird course was the meltingly tender veal shoulder roast with braised greens, carrots and black pepper pears. I wish we'd gotten a full portion of this.\\n\\nFrench press coffee was the best I'd had in a long time, and the cheese was accompanied by a dazzling orange marmalade. The one thing I really did not like was the tangerine dream dessert. The genoise was too sweet like a commercial cake. The cloying, marshmallowy meringue overwhelmed the dish, leaving me to search for the tangerine and the scant traces of thyme-buttermilk ice cream. Couldn't taste any thyme.\\n\\nBondir is truly charming and not bad at $100 for two including drinks and dessert.

So when my b/f and I decided we wanted to have a date night, I figured I would give their dinner a try.\\n\\nFirst off, the views of Mt. Hood and Mt. Saint Helen's are amazing, especially on a clear evening. \\n\\nFood wise...I mean, they're lucky they're getting 3 stars. We started with the calamari, which was one of the high points of the meal. I highly recommend getting those as a starter if you decided to dine at PCG. For the main dish, I went for the 7.5oz filet, with 12oz lobster, with a side of gratin & green beans, while the b/f went for a steak as well (can't remember which one specifically) prawns, with green beans and fries. Our steaks were meh at best. Mine was pushing well done, which for a filet is ridiculous. The lobster was the first I've had, so I can't speak from prior experience, but I enjoyed it much more than my filet. The b/f also felt his steak was over cooked. The best part of our main dishes were probably the fries and the prawns. That's a little disheartening.\\n\\nDrinks wise, I'd advise you to stick to their menu. I ordered an old fashioned, which was ok. My b/f tried to order a sazerac. Right off the bat, our waiter (who actually did a fantastic job) warned us that the bartender may not know how to make the drink. When the drink arrived, our waiter said the bartender had to call someone to make sure how it was made. The b/f wound up sending the drink back and trying their Manhattan instead, which still left something to be desired. \\n\\nFor dessert we had the cookies and ice cream. While my b/f wasn't impressed, I absolutely loved them. A scoop each of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, and 6 warm, literally fresh out of the oven cookies (chocolate chip, double chocolate, and white chocolate macadamia) that are to DIE for.\\n\\nOverall, while our waiter was terrific, I can't say I'd ever want to return for a dinner here.

Reservation was for 9 pm but we had to wait 20 minutes for our table. The guy who seated us seemed a little standoffish but I guess that's just his normal demeanor.\\n\\nOur waitress, however, was the nicest lady ever! I wish I asked for her name. Tall + blonde, if you need a reference. She never pressured us to hurry, always told us to take our time, patiently explained things on the menu when questioned, and even though towards the end of the night she was looking REALLY tired, always smiled when she came to our table and was always very professional.\\n\\nLots of people have left positive comments about the wine list here, but we only got a maple/mint soda which was... bizarre. I personally wouldn't order it again. It's just one of those really odd combinations that you either love or hate.\\n\\nNow for the food.\\n\\nBREAD - The Sea (seaweed, squid ink, shrimp) was interesting. That's about all I can say. Cracked Grain was tasty but VERY heavy (I recommend stopping after half a slice if you're a light eater). The third, Cracklings, was quite interesting as well, the scent of duck wafting in when you take a bite of the crackling is quite... nice.\\n\\nOLIVE SNACK - A mish mash of herbs, dehydrated olives, olive oil jelly. The jelly I quite liked, but I imagine it might be overwhelming for some people who aren't too fond of olive oil. The dehydrated olive was VERY salty.\\n\\nSOUPS - Complimentary. One was roasted beet with pistachios and berries. Very tasty, although it tasted a lot more like tomatoes than beets. The other was a fantastic morel and barley soup; perfect if you're a mushroom lover like me.\\n\\nSPICED BEETS - Beets were very nice. The confit lemon was unnecessary. Bavarian was excellent and went well with the wild rice.\\n\\nDUCK LIVER MOUSSE - Very very good. My favourite dish that night. The pickled radish was a perfect accompaniment to the rich mousse.\\n\\nWARTHOG CARBONARA - Misleading name. By warthog I assume they meant the slice of mangalitsa pancetta. The pasta was extreeeeemely underwhelming. The poached egg was the best part of the dish... which is kind of sad.\\n\\nHALIBUT BRANDADE - What a shame! This could have been a stellar dish if it wasn't drowned in salt. EVERYTHING on the plate was too salty, except the peas. The peas were the best peas I've ever had in my life. When we told our waitress this, she very kindly (and unexpectedly!) offered to replace the unfinished meal with a...\\n\\nDORSET CUSTARD - The tart was surprisingly nice, not overwhelmingly blue-cheesy. I have to say the crust was spectacular. All the other things on the side - confit shallot, polenta - didn't really help the dish in any way.\\n\\nKING SALMON - Salmon was well cooked (medium rare!) - however, it was terribly overshadowed by everything else. The genmaicha broth was very nice, as were the ramps. The chili froth seemed totally redundant and didn't really add to the flavour. The spinach was bizarrely bitter.\\n\\nBEEF BAVETTE - Perfectly cooked and executed fairly well for a non-prime cut. Nothing to write home about, but the flavours were good.\\n\\nMUSCAT SEMIFREDDO - Semifreddo was decent but everything else (jelly, herb foam) seemed to be there for show and didn't make the dish taste any better.\\n\\nICES - Spruce was disappointing, tasted like an odd fruit cream. However... the buttermilk/thyme and the dark chocolate sorbets were very enjoyable. I highly recommend getting the 2 together and mixing them (the slight saltiness/tartness of the buttermilk cuts through the dark chocolate and makes a very pleasant combination)\\n\\n\\nOverall, the food was a bit of a letdown. I enjoyed the starters and the dessert very much, but all the stuff in between seemed a little haphazard. The chef has some great ideas but needs to work on his execution. I like that he's all for trying new and interesting flavour combinations but sometimes you need a few elements that are familiar and simple in order to pull everything together. I felt there were too many redundant things, like the foam. It's a little bit sad when your best memories of the meal are from random things like the egg on the side, or that one roasted ramp, or the peas, when I had really hoped to go home raving about the main courses.\\n\\nTiming is an issue at Bondir -  we had to wait quite a while to be seated and our food took a very very long time to arrive (we ended up only leaving at 11:40 pm!!).

I was not disappointed.\\n\\nFirst off, when I saw it was in a bowling alley, I assumed it was one of those alley/restaurant deals. Nope, this place is straight up the snack shack at a bowling alley. It's probably one of the most unassuming places I've ever ordered a burger from. The grill is right there across from the ordering counter, and I chatted with the cashier and cook while I ordered. They were awesome, and the cashier even upgraded our drink sizes for free when I mentioned being from California and being a big fan of the Big Labowski (the sweet tea was SO GOOD)! I told him I wanted to order a white russian at their bar, to which he cracked up and said he would bring our food to us there.\\n\\nWe sat down at the bar, and the friendly bar tender immediately struck up a conversation. You should have seen her eyes roll when I asked how good her white russians were! She was such a good sport, and made me one of the best white russians I've ever had. (Not too sweet, where the vodka actually compliments the milk and Kahlua.) She even told us about a DIFFERENT burger place she enjoyed while we waited for our Labowski burgers!\\n\\nOnto the food. My wife and I both ordered a Jalepeno \\"fusion\\" burger. This sucker was big, spicy, and hot off the grill. They use a really tasty sweet roll style of bun that rounded out the savory sauce and jalepenos really well. I'm not going to say it's the best burger I've ever had, but it is probably in my top 5. The seasoned fries were cooked to a perfect golden-brown.\\n\\nI've never enjoyed eating in a bowling alley before. I will gladly come back to this place the next time I'm in town. Great burgers, great staff, and great white russians! ;)\\n\\nUPDATE: I've been in town twice since my first visit, and I've gone to Lebowski's both times. I've yet to be disappointed.

Got salt even though we asked for none.  \\n\\nThe guacamole was quite yummy!  They didn't skimp on it or the crab meat.  However, we got 13 chips.  Yes, 13!  They gave ample guacamole, though.  Luckily, later, they did bring out a cup of chips.  We still had so much guacamole left, they had to.  \\n\\nThe salsa kinda tasted like heartburn.  And, there was a tiny bit of it.  When people are saying that, they mean it.  They salsa came in a ramekin that was very small. I  would say the serving size was about half of a Snak-Pak pudding cup. For real.  I didn't like it at all.\\n\\nThe margarita was tasty as hell and strong.  Unfortunately, it was tiny.  It was about as much as you would get in a tea cup.  The glasses were fancy and modern, but really small.  I'm not exaggerating, either.  You will be surprised at how small they are-and not cheap in any way.\\n\\nI had the oyster taco platter.  They were damn good!  And it isn't even an oyster season (they say all food is fresh, and they have no freezer, so I don't know where they got the oysters.  They tell you this when you sit down.)

I am not sure if that is good or not. I wasn't broke yesterday, so It was okay.  \\n\\nOverall, I would say the food was good albeit small portioned.

I really liked the steak and cheddar eggs mostly for the cornmeal pancake that hides at the bottom of the skillet and soaks up all the flavors from the steak and eggs.

However, I don't remember the biscuit being all that great.

Not to say the fries weren't great but with a broth that rich and delicious I wanted something more substantial to soak it up with. For the entree I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the roast chicken. The salmon was great- served with green beans and a baked peach it was just right.

Pretty OK drinks, depending on who's making them, so consistency is definitely an issue.  I mean, this is a decent (term used loosely) coffee shop and I like the d√©cor - all punk oriented.  The reason I'm giving this place only an OK rating is that every time I go there, I have to shout to the person at the register to be heard and they, in turn, have to repeat themselves a couple of times before I can hear them.  The reason?  Because Refuge is very preoccupied with purporting the punk ambience, not only with the d√©cor and various tattooed baristas and cooks, but by playing the music WAY TOO LOUDLY all the time.  So that is my criticism.  I'm all about the punk atmosphere; I'm somewhat of a punk myself, but from a businessman's point of view, having the music so loud that it impedes good communication, not only between customer and staff, but among the staff themselves, becomes a problem.  Play your music, sure!  Just turn it down; we'll still get, and appreciate, the fact that you're all punks at Refuge.  An addendum:  Your bathroom is in total shambles.  It's been said by more than one restaurant critic that the state of a public restroom in an establishment is the measure of how much said establishment cares, ACTUALLY, about their clientele.

It comes with either fries or a small salad. And it's worth every cent. I can't tell you how disappointed I usually am with lobster rolls that come anywhere south of Portland, Maine. They're generally over-priced and a waste. This one stands apart as does everything at tiny Neptune Oyster, in the heart of Boston's North End. In a neighborhood, city and region rich with good dining; Neptune stands apart - the food here is really good. And it's pricey too. The high prices are justified but the whole experience can be a bit jarring. There's a marble bar/counter and then banquettes.

They have an array of healthy and not-so-healthy options. Avo/Queso sandwich is super tasty, fresh and simple. Lately, I've been getting the 'make your own breakfast sandwich' option. Super good as well -- especially the ciabatta bread! One of my friends I dragged along not too long ago had a salad and she said it was also tasty. Highly recommend their waffles\\nif you have a sweet tooth. They have a lot of options and usually have some featured waffle special. Last time I went it was a churro waffle! \\n\\nAs far as price, I think it's super reasonable. A lot of the time people don't realize that small businesses don't have all the luxuries of larger restaurant chains. So don't except super cheap prices but instead expect reasonable prices that reflect the quality of their food. You can easily have a meal here for $10 - $12 max. Probably, less if you don't get extra stuff. \\n\\nWait times are on the long side. Again, a product of being a small business. It can especially get lengthy if they have more than a few people being served. It's a tiny place, and they usually only have two people working. They don't have a true kitchen so this also adds to the wait time. However, I think the food is completely worth the wait!\\n\\nI only have two/three gripes with this place.... \\n\\nFor one, I noticed that my order is made differently (and I'm not talking about taste) depending on who makes it. Sometimes my bread is toasted and some times the eggs are actually cooked over easy. Sometimes I get chips, sometimes I don't. Not a big deal. Just being nit picky.\\n\\nTwo, one of the guys working here is a bit stand offish and comes across a rude at times. Not a big deal as I'm not coming in for a social experience, but a little kindness goes a long way. And I'm not social by any means, so it's not like I'm trying to carry a conversation.... think I read in one of the reviews that this problem has been fixed.\\n\\nThird, the hours can be VERY inconsistent. This probably one of the only major flaws with the place (it's not even that major). About 50% of time I've been here, it has been closed despite the displayed hours.

While the food was promising the service was ABYSMAL. We had a waitress who was belligerent and clearly did not want to be serving us. Not only was she condescending and invisible, she was poorly trained. When questioned about the wine list--one that looks very interesting, but unless one knows the regional varietals is like reading a menu written in Greek--she tried bluffing her way through. She compared the wine we were interested in to a Pinot from Oregon. On closer questioning she had no idea about the characteristics of a Willamette Valley wine. The meal went down hill from there. Five out of six of us ordered swordfish. It came out rare. We couldn't get the waitress back to remedy the problem, finally we corralled the manager who took them back to the kitchen with a promise of new fish for all. Sheepishly, he returned to say that they'd run out of swordfish and they would have to replate our original pieces. Our surly server brought them back and informed us that swordfish should be eater medium rare to rare. Ahem. It was a celebratory dinner--our daughter's engagement--we had sat at 8PM it was now very LATE. We didn't want to prolong the pain and accepted back our musical chair plates. We finished and the manager insisted on serving us desserts, trust me by 1030 no one wanted dessert we just wanted to get out. Yet, they appeared on the table. If you ask me it was a cheap way for the restaurant to try to satisfy a customer.

He then submitted the order on Friday (the lunch was today, a Tuesday). We know large groups can be cumbersome but that is why we ordered FIVE DAYS in advance.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, appies were already on the tables we had reserved - there were about 35 of us. \\n\\nAfter the appies were demolished we started the waiting game for our food. We were all told to arrive by noon sharp. Most of us did, however, our food did not. Around 12:45, food started coming out (45 mins late). About 8 people were served and then the servers all disappeared. Around 10 minutes later, some more food came out. It continued like this until almost 1:30. The bussers were very busy removing empty plates well before a lot of us were even served our lunch.\\n\\nWhen I finally received my lunch (Chicken Tacos), the food was tasteless and appeared thrown together. \\n\\nNeedless to say, the organizer of this lunch as well as those of us who were served late, were extremely annoyed by the staff's lack of desire to provide us with good customer service. Reactions from the on-duty manager were \\"well the food is on its way out\\" and feeble apologies. She clearly did not care at all that we were upset.\\n\\nBy the time about half of us had left, our Project Manager came around and told us that as compensation, we could all order dessert on the house and that all of our drinks were comped. Obviously, since we all only get an hour for lunch, and we had already been away from the office for nearly 2 hours, none of us were about to either a) stick around and drink or b) wait for someone to figure out how to slice a cake. \\n\\nThis tab could have resulted in a very nice tip and word-of-mouth to the rest of our colleagues but now it is resulting in a negative review.

Never once did we get a hello, welcome, our specials are... anything!  We even had to ask the waiter for chips and salsa, we were then scorned \\"They are only brought out on request\\"  Ok idiot, I REQUESTED THEM! Mean while, two girls sat at the table behind us, and I am not one to pull the race card, but that is the only excuse I could find since we were the same age and dressed similarly, those girls (white) were greeted by the same waiter, told enthusiastically about the specials, and guess what, they did not have to request chips, he had them ready.   Ordered the appetizer size salad and the quesadilla, the cheese was not fully melted, honestly Taco Bell's steak quesadilla comes out fresher than that did.  Friend had the crab empanadas, they were mediocre, just a pie crust stuffed with crab meat. At the end of the day, asked the waiter to split the check, billing us all separately, he brought a check that was split 3 ways.  At this point my patience was up and had him get the manager.  After explaining to the manager what happen, he told us to hold on, we sat for another 15 minutes, waiting for 1)the check to be brought back and 2) the manager.  The manager came back with an apology and a 15 dollar gift card for our next visit (NOT HAPPENING)  and we were STILL waiting on the check.

Oyster with a \\"champagne\\" finish was ok, prefer island creek oysters. Maine lobster roll was delicious - warm buttered roll with heaps of perfectly cooked lobster with just the right crunch. It was pure lobster meat with no mayo or other salad fillers mixed in. Staff were also friendly too with great recommendations for oysters and drinks. Felt lucky that we came at 6pm because by 8:30pm, ppl asking to be put on the list had to be turned away. Next time, I would try the crudos - they looked delicious."},{"name":"Teji's Indian Restaurant and Grocery","address":"2100B Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Good Indian food at a great price near campus!  It's a great little spot I just had to try when I found out about it.  The only dish I've had was their lamb curry combo, and it was delicious.  The combo comes with a lot of food, so come hungry.  \\n\\nThe lamb is amazing - tender, flavorful, and spicy, and the naan is great.  I've never had naan I didn't like, and this was no exception.  A very slight char on the outside, but soft and warm on the inside.  The combo comes with basic naan, but I was still eyeing the other naans that came by.  The garlic naan looked beautiful.\\n\\nEverything else was alright.  Nothing amazing about their vegetable curry or rice.  Mainly just filler for me.  I'd be much happier with more lamb curry and naan.  The yogurt dessert though was pretty good!  I enjoyed it quite a bit.\\n\\nOnly real complaint I had was the mango lassi.  It was way too thick and sweet for me. If it were diluted down significantly, it would have been perfect.  As it was, it was almost sickeningly sweet.\\n\\nOtherwise, however, a great new addition to restaurants on the drag!

The scallops my husband ordered were opaque all the way through, again over cooked. Our best friend while not a strong seafood fan tried the burger and fried. Hard to mess up right?? The burger patty was thick as described, but the medium rare burger came out well done and a strange dense consistency. The fries were soggy and cold as well.

I have to be honest though, eh?\\n\\nI've spent a limited amount of time in the South, so when someone complains that the food here isn't authentic, I really have no way of qualifying such a remark.  Regardless, the food is f'ing delicious.  I highly recommend the \\"Meat and Three\\", which is any of their barbecue meats, plus three sides (that's a ton of food, by the way).  Beans, greens, and corn pudding is a pretty typical set for me.  The variety of sides is what really makes the food special in my mind.  That and the beer--Redbones has a great rotating beer list that is one of the best I've seen north of the river.\\n\\nOn the flip side, I have to take off a star since the table service can be a bit spotty at times (the bartenders, however, have always been fantastic), and the food a bit inconsistent.  The fried okra is pretty weak, and sometimes the food doesn't taste quite as fresh as it should.

The host immediately took our coats for us and seated us. The clientele was dressed fairly casually.\\n\\nThe food was definitely the highlight of the evening. The menu, which changes every day, was short but everything sounded delicious. They even make their own bread- a plus for me since I love bread. My mom and I both started with the potato and leek soup ($9)- which was AMAZING. We were literally still talking about it on the walk home. It was filling and satisfying without being creamy or heavy. We both went with the half portions on entrees- my mom got the squash ($12 for half) and I got the chive pappardelle ($13 for half). I was obsessed with the squash, but while the chive pappardelle was good, it didn't completely blow me away. For dessert, we shared the tangerine dream ($9), which was ridiculously amazing. Like.... I wanted to go into the kitchen, grab all the ingredients, run home and eat it all. That's how good it was. All the dishes had tons of ingredients but tasted simple and delicious. We left full and satiated but not uncomfortable- the food was not heavy. Based on the food and the decor alone, this place would easily have been 5 stars. \\n\\nHowever, the service was a bit sub-par for us. It was really only our waitress... she wasn't friendly and seemed overwhelmed. When we asked her what something on the menu was, she gave a short, incoherent response- and we still had no idea. She also did lots of little things that were a bit odd/rude- for example, she took away my bread plate without asking when there was still bread to be eaten (but left my mother's), and took away my napkin when I went to the bathroom towards the end of the meal but while we were still drinking. When I asked for sweet n low for my pot of tea, she told me that they only had sugar- which was fine. She gave me sugar, and then 10 minutes later, without saying anything, she grabbed the entire container of sugar and gave it to another table. I still had an entire pot of tea left. My mom and I just looked at each other and I was like, \\"I guess I'm done drinking my tea?\\" And then on our way out, we saw a container of sweet n low on the table. Our interactions with her were like that for most of the night- just mostly odd. But on our way out, we stopped and chatted to another woman who was super friendly and seemed really great. When we left, I turned to my mom and said \\"I wish she had been our waitress!\\" and my mom just said, \\"I know!!\\". \\n\\nI'm pretty sure the service was an anomaly, and honestly the food was so good that it barely mattered.

Their menu seems to have Tex-Mex and Baja influences, with fish tacos (sadly batterfried, not grilled) as well as a number of burritos and plates featuring potatoes paired with various meats, including shrimp with or w/o Tequila-BBQ sauce.\\n\\nThey also have quite a few options for vegetarians, and I'm not just talking beans and rice.  They've got salads, nachos, quesadillas, veggie fajitas and burritos, even some tofu dishes - all of this is pretty impressive for a non frou-frou Mexican place.\\n\\nThey have lot's of combo plates that are universally a great value, many of which are written up on boards both in and outside the restaurant - but NOT written on their menu board.  Even if you don't get a combo special the prices are quite cheap - even at my hungriest I'd have a hard time dropping more than $10 (including a soda and tip) and still walk out of there stuffed.\\n\\nOne combo special that seems to be in the regular rotation is the 2 taco, chips, and drink deal for $4.50.  They're served in the traditional taqueria-style, on little CD-sized soft corn tortillas, with meat (I go with 1 Carne Asada, 1 Pollo), onions, cilantro, and salsa.  For some reason they tossed a scoop of beans on each of my tacos last night, which was not a welcome addition - it wasn't bad, just not what I wanted or ordered.\\n\\nUnfortunately for My Lady, they managed to mess up both of the items in her combo.  She ended up with a chicken enchilada (she ordered cheese), and despite asking for no sour cream or guacamole on her taco, they slapped a massive dollop of sour cream, and when we took it back they gave us a taco with guacamole (which she tolerates, but doesn't appreciate) - we cut our losses and didn't send it back a 2nd time.\\n\\nWe showed up just a little over 30 mins before they close, so perhaps that is part of the reason why they made so many mistakes, but I don't really consider that an excuse.  Turn people away if you're not willing/able to handle their orders.\\n\\nThe ingredients are usually pretty fresh tasting and cooked to order.  They have 3 different options in their salsa bar, but I really only like one and even that one leaves a lot to be desired.  It seems obvious to me that they are catering to the Hawthorne \\"gringos\\" as none of them come even close to what I'd describe as even medium heat.\\n\\nThe ambiance is pretty cheerful, bright, and colorful and the seating area is pretty wide open and varied between tables and booths.  They have a few tables set up outside, but not much cover so this is really only useful when the weather is nice.\\n\\nAll in all Pepino's is a decent place, with a very good menu and super prices.  Normally they don't make as many mistakes, so I'll chalk that up to an off night.  It's not the fanciest nor best tasting, but it is good pretty fast; and when I find myself on this stretch of Hawthorne it's always on my radar for cheap quick eats."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Pizza Company","address":"118 Washington St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"Ordered a specialty pizza, \\"the vision\\" and added chicken.

Also, they sell chicken tenders and bites for those who don't like bones. I took a star off for their decor and their outside sign.  The chairs had dried paint all over them and looked old and used for a restaurant that just opened. The outside sign is a small banner held up by strings.

Between my girlfriend and me, we ordered the fish and chips, spare ribs, parmesan fries, and fried calamari. \\n\\n- Fish and chips: pretty good! The crust is a little bit on the thick side and does need some salt, but the tartar sauce that they serve is sufficient. \\n\\n- Spicy chili ginger pork riblets: the riblets were a bit too lightly glazed in my opinion and could have been more tender. They give you a large portion here, but I wish they gave you a side container of sauce.\\n\\n- Parmesan fries: oops, didn't realize that the fish and chips came with fries so I ordered an extra order. Huge portion size, so if you just love steak fries and can't get enough, I'd recommend order this as a side. Comes with an aioli sauce. Wish it had ketchup.\\n\\n- Fried calamari: WAY TOO SALTY. After eat bite, I had to drink a huge gulp of water. Unlike most fried calamari with is simply breaded, the fried calamari here is glazed in exactly the same way you'd find orange chicken or kung pao chicken.

The #2 omelette was bland and the red onions, mushrooms and bell peppers were under cooked. There was supposed to be ham in it and there was small thin pieces but in a $9 omelette I expect good flavorful ham in every bite. The buttermilk pancakes with bananas and pecans were tasty but dry.

When we arrived I noticed quite a few empty tables I assumed were reserved, but we ended up getting seated in one, after the wait, and there were a few that stayed open through the meal.  Understaffed maybe?  Cancelled reservations?  Those tables were in the back, so people packed in the front/around the bar better for business?  Not sure.\\n\\nSummary:\\nI'd recommend eating there on a weekday perhaps, avoid the bar crowd if you can, or join it!

I'll try the cold version next time for comparison's sake.\\n\\n// Neptune Johnnycake ($18) - 3 stars\\nThis dish is an interesting of composition of both sweet and savory ingredients: cake, trout, and caviar. Still, I wasn't a huge fan of it because of the thick layer of oil that the cake was sitting on. Made it feel too dense.\\n\\n// Oyster 'Piggybacks' ($15) - 4 stars\\nVery unique, but the piggybacks turned out to be heavy on the pork flavor.

I have gone there 6-7 times ordering a different menu item on each visit. Carne asada, carnitas, chicken enchilada, etc and every single time I find large pieces of gristle, fat, even bone.

Me and my Mother have both been involved in the restaurant industry for many years.\\n\\nWe were greeting by a very friendly bartender, who was incredibly attentive the entire time, and provided excellent service. We had a couple of cocktails, the Daiquiri and the Hurricane, which where honestly good enough since after browsing the shelves I later realized that they must only have a cordials license.\\n\\nThe space it's self was huge, and very well decorated. For our meals I had the Cauliflower & Brussels sprout dish which was incredible, all the vegetables had a perfect crunch but still had that nice crispy seared side, the hint of vinegar added an incredible dimension to the dish. Next, the Garlic noodles which were also another incredible dish, I wolfed them down in about 2 minutes.\\n\\nMy mother ordered the Seafood Etoufee after scanning the menu over for a cajun sirloin or a fillet mignon which they do not have on the menu. Nonetheless, she said her dish was amazing, promptly after it was dropped off and my face was in the garlic noodles I looked over and her dish was gone as well. \\n\\nI think that overall, Bootleg Special has a lot going for it, the service was great and the food was incredible. I did find it kind of strange that they had no specials, incredibly odd for a place that is very seafood oriented.

Tasty n Alder is a major player on that list of places that I would travel to just to eat. How did I come about to choosing Tasty N Alder as a place to have a meal at during my short trip to Portland you ask? Everyone at my office and I mean everyone who's ever been or lived in Portland all had this place on their lists. It was hands down the place I was told to go.  Guess, what they were all freaking right. \\n\\nHospitality and service was top notch from beginning to end.  Our hostess was charming and honest about our wait though we lucked out on an outdoor table when a couple decided to bounce after looking at their menu.  If you're that couple and you happen to read this review I thank you and all so want to say Shame on you because you missed out on a hell of a meal. \\n\\nWe came for breakfast around 10 pm. Sat down shortly after thanks to our bit of luck. Our waitress was super charming and honest about what she thought was good, popular, and what was enough food for the two of us. We still over ordered but hey there's a lucky homeless guy who scored a fantastic bag of leftovers. I'm sorry I didn't provide them a fork.\\n\\nWe ordered the Chicken and egg biscuit, potatoes bravas, tasty hangtown fry, and the \\"Whole toad\\".  Chicken and egg biscuit was a sexy upscale version of a chicken and biscuit from Chick-fil-a. If you love those then this thing is that if it made love to Kate Upton. The biscuit was amazing and the chicken was truly to die for. If we had gotten two of those and called it a day we would have still been happy. Potatoes bravas were perfectly cooked potato bites with a little spicy kick. If it wasn't enough of a kick you get a little side of aioli. Tasty but as we were told a small is more than enough for two which it was.  Not to mention we needed room for the next two dishes.  The hangtown fry was a take on the famous Tadich Grill dish which they claim to have invented. As much as I adore the original the Tasty n Alder remix was great on it's own right.  Last but not least was one of their signature dishes the \\"Whole Toad\\". There was no toad in the dish but when they tell you to mix a small pot of eggs and what not for 30 seconds then toss it on some toast you almost have to assume something magical should happen. It was definitely the star of the show. \\n\\nThe value one the meal was certainly very good here and won't break your breakfast bank. If you decide to go to Tasty N Alder you'll be in for a treat the moment you walk in. I can't wait to go to Portland again just to come here. If you go and you don't like it. Don't give your leftovers away.  Feel free to message me and I'll send you an address and you can send me your leftovers.

I ended up getting my breakfast/food at 1:40pm and once again they blamed it on the delivery driver. So I explained what happened to the delivery driver once he got here and he said it's not his fault. I called the restaurant and the manager said we will be refunded right away but nothing has changed. Every time I've had food delivered from Brother's Taverna, it's always the delivery driver's fault. I hope to be refunded soon and if not, I'll let most people know about my experience and have them rate this restaurant like I did."},{"name":"FoMu","address":"481 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"Really delicious coconut milk ice cream.

A black man was seated next to us (not eating or drinking anything) just watching his phone. This location often has druggie type people inside the restaurant who are not eating. Suddenly horrible whipping sounds and tortuous screams started coming out of his phone. It was loud and went on and on. He just calmly watched whatever it was. It is truly not easy to eat food to the sounds of someone shrieking and screaming in pain. We went to leave (having cut our lunch short because of this) and I thought the manager should be alerted to it... so I went to the counter and asked to speak to the person in charge.\\n\\nA young girl said \\"Are you sure you need a manager?\\" Yes, I said. She went and got a Hispanic woman.  I told her about our experience. The black man was still there watching his torture video as I informed her of the situation. She was VERY dismissive of my complaint. She hurriedly said \\"Well, I'll keep an eye on it\\" and she turned on her heel and left me standing at the counter. It made me think that maybe the torture-watcher was her boyfriend or something! She sure made it clear she was NOT going to do a thing about it and further she didn't have any sympathy for us and how our lunch was affected.\\n\\nI come to this McDonalds a lot, because it is just at a perfect walking distance for me. I like their dollar coffee and the McFlurries (when their machine is working) are a nice treat.  We have noticed a clear deterioration in management over the past year. The management never asks the non-paying druggie types to leave while we have to put up with them. I wrote to McDonalds over this, but I have doubts that they will address the issue. \\n\\nThis location really ought to hire a big bouncer type guy with a badge.

Maybe he thought it was a prank call or something of the sort, but I tried to explain that it was not a laughing matter and the smallest cross contamination could result in the death of my brother, but Sam was not having it and proceeded to laugh and say \\"ok buddy\\".  He was clearly incompetent and unable to grasp the severity of the matter.  I was going to ask to speak to the chef, but just as I began to start my sentence he hung up on me once again.  Now I realize why this place has only two stars here on Yelp.\\n\\nTheir service really needs to be improved if they ever want to become a successful restaurant, and after reading some other reviews, it seems like other customers seem to agree with me.  It also seems that the owner reads and responds to some reviews, so I genuinely hope he sees this.  If you want people to be more pleased with your service, maybe you should take some steps to hire employees who actually have a clue what they are doing and can deliver actual acceptable service.  I understand that you can't cater to every need of all customers, but flat out ignoring them and treating them as inferior is disgusting.

The Mahi sandwich tasted great, and had a good balance of crunch with the parmesan crust along with a soft mayo spread. The green beans were fresh long green beans that had a nice snap to it, but just a little too sweet for my taste buds. Done well though. The Roast Beef sandwich was stuffed to the brim and had nicely caramelized onions and moist tender beef slices. We really enjoyed the roasted potatoes, not overly roasted and seasoned JUST RIGHT. Our friend ordered a Chicken Chopped Salad and it was HUGE! Two of our other friends' food did NOT look appetizing at all though. They ordered flatbreads initially, but then they said because they were out, they had to change their food choice. One ended up getting a pepperoni pizza flatbread that didn't look that great, and the other got an alfredo dish that didn't look that great either. Mind you, their dishes were about $9, so for what it was, it was TOTALLY not worth it.\\n\\nOur's, on the other hand, were only $10 and were MUCH MORE substantial in terms of quality, size, and overall preparation.

Neil (owner) is always nothing but smiles  and provides phenomenal customer service. This dude can sell a ketchup Popsicle to a woman in white gloves. I'm not sure what a few people are talking about in other reviews about this place being a tad pricey. I have no problem whatsoever paying $6 and change for a 5 piece. I'm sure prepping the wing pops can be labor intensive and I'm not an idiot, I've been to heb before and the price of chicken wings isn't cheap.

The trailer is located behind Corner Bar next to another favorite of mine Potato A.

I knew NOTHING about kava before coming here, not even that it existed.\\n\\nIn my head, I had decided I wanted kombucha, but would settle for coffee (\\"java\\"). So when I wandered into the bar, my hunger-confused brain somehow decided that \\"kava\\" (\\"Kombucha java? Sounds weird but maybe that's just their quirky name for a coffee drink? It looks like coffee...?\\") was something I needed to get. The bartenders and other patrons were so eager to hear that I was interested to try \\"kava,\\" that once I finally got it through my muddled brain that this drink was entirely different from anything I was expecting, I felt like I had to try it . (Lo and behold, right as the friendly barista turned around to prepare my order, my eyes fell upon the kombucha tap to the side of the bar. But what the heck; I was swept away, albeit a little unexpectedly but whatever, on a new culinary adventure, so let's do this.)\\n\\nI got my coconut cup, a dauntingly large carafe of what looked like a light brown iced coffee, and settled in. Having been told that my mouth might go a bit numb (and this is normal), it can cause me to get pretty chill, and it was from some plant I had never heard of, I texted my husband and told him if he didn't hear from me for a few hours, it might be because my mouth was numb and I was stoned in a Barton Springs restaurant on a root drink, (lol) I took my first sip.\\n\\nNot gonna lie; didn't care for the taste. Definitely should have gone with some coconut milk or whatever as an add-in for my first time.\\n\\nHowever, what struck me about the whole experience was just how friendly the people were. People saw me sitting alone, and struck up conversations. The bartenders were all clearly really happy in their jobs. The space was beautiful and serene, despite being next to a busy road. And yes, the kava was really calming, but not overly so. Still was totally fine to drive; it's like it just took the edge off the day, and sprinkled in like 10% happiness and good cheer over my whole mood?\\n\\nI heard several patrons explain that they liked going there and drinking kava, because it still was a way to socialize, without it having to be over alcohol. I can honestly say, if I lived in Austin and found the right flavor add-ins, I think I would be a regular here for the same reason. Nice people, a beautiful location, with a fun drink that improves your day and doesn't have nasty after-effects; who wouldn't want to have after-work drinks at this place, at least a few times a month?\\n\\nIt wasn't what I was expecting, but it was what I needed, and I really loved the atmosphere. I would actually come back, but I'll be more mentally prepared next time, haha."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Let me begin by saying that if you haven't been to Tasty n Alder for their hushpuppies, I don't know what you're waiting for. Get thee there forthwith....I do love my Southern-inspired foods, especially when the inspiration's by way of the PNW's emphasis on seasonal ingredients shot through with international flair. If that sounds like a mess, it isn't; instead, it's the enticing promise of a kitchen usually equipped to make good on complexity and then some. From the bracing acidity that cuts the richness of egg and manchego in the radicchio salad, to the unbelievably tender octopus, to the simple salty butter on a thick pillowy slice of bread, your culinary journey will be varied and memorable.\\n\\nYet that's all assuming you can be seated and served. Considering I recommended this to some dear out-of-town friends, and we spent our one evening out enduring a slowly rising tide of continuous service fails ranging from minimal to massive, it'll be hard to drag myself back.\\n\\nThe misery turned hilarity through sheer disbelief at situation after situation; ultimately we had to wait almost two hours for a table (for four) after being quoted a 35 or 40-minute wait. Our first clue was when about an hour in one of the roving servers brought us a plate of bread and hushpuppies on the house. To be fair, we'd ordered drinks and were happy enough to stand and wait in the bar area, and by that point hadn't even asked about our table. But about a half-hour later she brought out another plate on the house (crab dip this time, after we'd specifically said - in response to her query about dietary restrictions - that one of our party was allergic to seafood), and we started to worry. An hour and forty-five minutes into our wait the rest of my group wanted to leave and go elsewhere, so I went to settle up at the bar and explain we were going. At that moment the server said they were finally setting our table RIGHT THEN, so I called everyone back to the restaurant. Sunk costs and all that....\\n\\nFinally we hoped our dining dreams might come true after waiting for two hours, but after taking our order our server reappeared, fifteen or so minutes later, to explain that he'd lost it so he needed to get it again. Fine....The kitchen sent out a cheese plate, which we really didn't need because we'd already ordered the dishes we wanted to eat. \\n\\nEveryone we interacted with was quite friendly, but the night ended up being memorable for all the wrong reasons and my friends were still frustrated the next day. A better policy for dealing with such errors would be to comp diners for food they're actually ordering and want to eat, instead of sending out extra dishes (well-intentioned as that might be). I'm sure I'll venture back at some point, but I won't be in a hurry to do so given all the other excellent options this town and that area have to offer."},{"name":"Match","address":"94 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Amazing decor, beautiful servers, nice bar, greasy good food menu but something is missing...\\nFirst of all as a DJ I have to tell YOU MATCH PEOPLE that turntables are not an effin decoration.

That was, what, a year ago??!??!??!!  \\nMusic was still cool and the atmosphere is loungy although the crowd seems to be the same that used to come to this location when it was called (I don't know it was changing names too fast to keep up)...  Crowd was mostly American; this probably has something to do with the country where Match is located.\\nI did have their signature  burgers and I have to say: Thank God someone figured it out and spiced the meat a bit.

I had never heard of Tasty and Alder.\\n\\n11:30am.  On the invitation of some Seattleite friends visiting the area for the weekend (and who had spent some time living in Portland), I'm sitting at a table in Tasty and Alder.\\n\\nA first glance at the menu reveals a place I'd best describe as the American food version of a Tapas Bar.  While you can order a number of full size plates, the best tactic here is to order a bunch of little things that everyone around your table shares.\\n\\nAnd those things were tasty.  Really tasty.\\n\\nOur party of five shared perhaps 10 different plates.  We started with the Radicchio Salad: bits of the slightly bitter purple lettuce mixed in with chunks of bacon \\"lardons\\" (think thick chunks of bacon) and hard boiled egg with a nice dressing.  Okay, pretty decent start for a brunch salad.\\n\\nNext was the Polenta and Sugo with Mozzarella and over-easy egg.  I don't even know what Sugo is.  After looking it up....I still don't really know.  What I do know is it was incredibly yummy.  Creamy over easy egg oozing all over meaty polenta-y stuff.  Heaven.\\n\\nNext, the \\"duck duck steak,\\" a positively delightful medium-rare hunk of meat perfectly seared in duck fat, with these crisp potatoes on the side.  Really amazingly great.\\n\\nThe biscuits and venison sausage gravy.  Seriously?  Venison gravy?  Wow.  One plate wasn't enough and we ordered a second.  Three tiny (but oh-so-wonderful) biscuits on the plate, drenched in the most wondrous gravy with chunks of venison in it.  My wife, with her deep south roots, approved mightily.\\n\\nWe tried plate after plate.  Without a doubt, everything we had there was top notch eating.  To call any one plate my \\"favorite\\" would only serve to do an injustice to the others so I'll just wrap it up with \\"everything could not have been improved in any appreciable way.\\"\\n\\nThe bill, for five of us (including several lovely drinks--oh by the way, the bar is slammin...) came to about $130.  Pricing-wise, you're also in it for a chunk of change.  The plates run between $6 and $10 each, and a table of five of us went through a solid 10-12.  This is tapas pricing. \\n\\nBut the quality is there.  The service is there.

I was traveling with my wife, a toddler and a baby.\\nAt the restaurant, we had to do a 45 minute wait since the hostess mentioned the next available dining slot is only available at 5 PM. It was pretty tough to manage the kids for 45 minutes - but we managed to hang on waiting next to the elevators. We already lost the \\"view bonus\\" part of it since the sun was setting already.\\nAfter a long wait, we were now hungry and ready for dinner.  We were told there weren't any window seats available. That was alright. But we noticed that the dining area was more than 50% empty - (and remained so for 45 minutes or so and myabe got 70% full, still with few empty tables). I was a bit upset.  I know folks reserve and do no-shows - but this was reserve-and-no-show set on steroids. With parents struggling with their two little kids right by their reservation area, a top-notch restaurant would certainly do better with half the tables empty. Please -no excuses. I have seen better.\\n\\nThe food was good. However, there are very little options for vegetarians - unless you can do with a risotto/pasta, (which I didn't notice in the menu).  Since the wait time was too long, my wife had gone to the hostess and confirmed in advance if there are veg options available. She mentioned that the restaurant can always do something custom/build some veggie options.  But the manager/bearer who served us knew very little on this. Anyway after confirming with the chef, they did provide us a great veg sandwich with avocados/tomatoes etc.\\n\\nThe Paella I ordered was great, though the portion isn't generous - for me thats ok, I understand. Its an expensive restaurant - portions are usually not that big. \\nBut there were just two glasses of water served for four of us, and the second drink i ordered never arrived before I finished the food. I canceled the drink order\\n\\nIn summary  - great food, great views (though we couldnt get the best of it), the folks who served us seemed to try well to do their best - but well, it fell very below our expectations  - especially coming with an expectation of eating of one of the finest restaurants in Portland.\\nGreat restaurants can certainly do better.

The lobster roll is salty and filling and the chowder is creamy and generous with potato and clam. I have tried their root beer, blueberry soda, and blueberry lemonade. The root beer is good (tastes a little different from name brand root beer) and the blueberry soda tastes exactly what you'd expect blueberry soda to taste like. I was pleasantly surprised by the blueberry lemonade even though he blueberry gets overshadowed by the flavors of lemonade and honey. I usually don't enjoy the taste of honey, but for some reason it went well with the rest of the meal. \\n\\nTwo more pros: there is ample seating and they have a punch card. \\nLuke's can be a little pricey (especially for a city with so many college students), but when guests come or you feel like splurging a little, it's worth coming to this establishment."},{"name":"Ichiro Sushi","address":"538A Adams St","city":"Milton","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I stopped here to get off of 93S cause the traffic as always sucked and we couldn't be happier.

If you want to have a good time in a restaurant with incredible ambience go to Imperial Fez.  It feels like you are in a restaurant in a mysterious middle eastern country as soon as you walk in the door.   The furnishings are plush and nice to look at.  Its dark in the restaurant but i think that adds to its allure.  The belly dancers are cool and its fun sitting on the oversized pillows.  I could turn the dining room into one giant bedroom its that comfortable.  Now onto the food.  I was a little disappointed.  I got the couscous with a variety of meats and vegetables.  The vegetables were very soft, overcooked i think.  I dont like eating vegetables that turn to mush in my mouth.  The meats were relatively good but maybe not as flavorful as i would have expected.  The couscous, virtually flavorless.  My friend had ribs.  I knew before they came out they were not going to be your average american ribs.  They were good but i was not blown away by them.  The soup and salad were very good though.  I would definitely come back here though as the food was not atrocious.

Maybe its the smallness of the museum, maybe its just not been around long enough to acquire cool art, whatever it is its only decent. What really makes this museum good is the traveling exhibits. My favorite over the years has been the little black dress display, and the Faberge eggs. These were cool exhibits with lots to look at and learn. Not totally a downer, the permanent exhibits are ok too. I like the Renaissance room with its dark wood and somber atmosphere. The suits of armor in the hallways are neat. The museum has a lot of local art which is also fun to see. For kids this place is the bomb. I'm sure it helps take away the stuffiness they associate with art that's not a screen saver. The real reason to go is the gift shop. I have found some really cool jewelery and unique gifts here. Its just kind of sad that its the main reason I go.

The service can be bland, but the drinks come by plenty easy. Now, their main strength is their music, in my opinion. No matter what day of the week that they are open, there are always some great tunes being played that are difficult to find at other bars/lounges.

They have quite an extensive menu, including 10+ tapas and a multitude of entrees. I enjoyed their avocado aquacate relleno tapas very much. My mom also raved about their Wedge Salad, which was served with candied walnuts and Serrano ham. \\n\\nMy go-to dish is their Paella Barcelona, consisting of chicken, chorizo, shrimp, squid, clams and mussels. $30 is a bit steep for paella, but it tastes amazing and the portions are large.

I REALLY wanted to try one of their famous sticky buns, but alas there were none when we went. A little piece of my heart broke that day. I'm not sure if there was a shortage of pastries that afternoon or if we just came at an inopportune time, but there weren't many to choose from. I ended up getting the sticky bun bread pudding (close enough, right?) and my two roommates also got bread puddings (a berry one and a chocolate one I believe). Honestly, I think it's pretty hard to screw up bread pudding for me, but it was nevertheless delicious. I then vowed to come back at another time in the pursuit of a sticky bun. \\n\\nToday, I walked past Flour with my brother and decided to roll the dice and pray that the selection be more diverse today. As we walked in, a hallelujah chorus rang through my brain as my eyes met with THE STICKY BUN! I quickly consulted with my brother and hurried to order in fears that more people would arrive and snatch the 3 buns that were on display. My brother decided on the Vegan Lowfat Chocolate Cake (he is allergic to dairy and wanted some chocolate) and luckily there was a small table open so we sat down and dug in. \\n\\nOh. My. God. The sticky bun was amazing! Soft and gooey and crunchy (topped with nuts) and overall made me want to lick the plate. I now know what all the hype is about and man, all of the reviewers have it spot on.

Once you come in here, it feels like going into someones house.  Seriously, I've never encountered anything like it before.  The young woman was extremely warm and helpful (since I had no idea what anything was) and the older lady, despite her ever improving English, was also cheerful and excited about introducing us to the food.  They want you to be here!  Sometimes you have people who couldn't care less, but the people at Chago's (I am assuming the owners/family) genuinely want you to enjoy your meal.  The warmth is real, not fake.  No pretentiousness here, just down to earth people who really care!  \\n\\nThe second reason is known as Yucca and Plantain chips with the mean garlic dip on the side.  I could munch on these all day.  Yes, I'm still tasting the effects right now, so don't kiss me, but at least the vampires won't dare to suck my blood.

We ordered a Greek salad to share. It was not the old traditional salad with fresh iceberg lettuce, nice quartered tomatoes and good, quality feta.

We had ordered extra cheese for the salad and it came with what looked like less than a regular amount.\\n\\nI had baked lamb. It arrived barely warm and was so fatty gross that I only ate a few carefully picked out bites. Brothers used to have delicious, handcut french fires.

My coworker and I came for a late dinner around 8:15pm on a Thursday, and was shocked to hear that their waiting list was already full for the night! The hostess said we were welcome to come back around 9pm to check if  anyone dropped off the waiting list, but there were no guarantees that we would get a seat. Since I can be quite stubborn when it comes to food, and my coworker was nice enough to wait, we walked around the North End for a while (and grabbed a cannoli from Bova's!) before returning. Note that the hostess isn't always at the front of the restaurant, so you may have to wait awkwardly by the wall (where there isn't much room) until she comes up. You're also not really allowed to wait inside if your name is already on the list since the place is so small, and only people who have been called from the waiting list and are waiting to be seated should be inside. Once we saw her again, the hostess had us wait a bit more (which ended up being another 30-40 minutes) to see if they could accommodate us. The entire time we were waiting there were two seats at the counter that were open, and we could have ordered and finished eating by the time we were sat. In those exact seats. In any case, when we finally sat down, we tried:\\n\\n-Hot Lobster Roll w/Butter ($28, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/neptune-oyster-boston?select=epxtbtEQHvtSTTrA99kxCg#epxtbtEQHvtSTTrA99kxCg): Good, but not as amazing as I was expecting. I think we should have gone for the cold lobster roll. However, the fries were good, and they give you a huge portion.\\n-Neptune Johnnycake (Honey Butter, Smoked Trout Tartare, Sturgeon Caviar, $16, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/neptune-oyster-boston?select=nWD0XUgbCnYHy_uvGJ5fYg#HNslZtnILw4s0zAsYmT59Q): I couldn't decide if I liked this or not. I liked the johnnycake itself, which was a lot like a fluffy pancake. I loved the caviar, but the trout.. I was really on the fence about the fishiness of it. I would recommend at least giving this dish a try.\\n-Island Creek Oyster (Duxbury, MA, Medium Size, High Salt, Juicy, Fruity Finish, $2.90/ea), Cotuit Oyster (Cotuit Bay, MA, Medium-Large Size, High Salt, Plump, Butter Finish, $2.80/ea), Pemaquid (Damariscotta, ME, Medium Size, Medium Salt, Citrus Finish, $2.90/ea) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/neptune-oyster-boston?select=nWD0XUgbCnYHy_uvGJ5fYg#nWD0XUgbCnYHy_uvGJ5fYg]: The tasting notes on the oyster list are very accurate, so if you're not a fan of salty oysters, avoid the ones that say high salt! The Island Creek was on the salty side but had a clean aftertaste, and was my favorite out of the three. The Cotuit was super salty, and I didn't like this much. The Pemaquid was also on the salty side, but I liked that it wasn't too plump. All of them were very fresh though, and they shuck them to order- I'd highly recommend giving a few varieties a try.\\n\\nI liked that they had 12 varieties of oysters available that night, with the majority of them from MA or from the East Coast. However, I wasn't that impressed with my overall dining experience here and thought that Neptune Oyster is way overrated. I might be singing a different tune if I got that cold lobster roll, but the wait and cramped seating arrangements were not really worth the salty oysters (despite the freshness), fishy tasting johnnycake, and warm lobster roll. Our actual server at the counter was really nice, but the hostess was on the surly side. Parking is the worst part- there is very little street parking available in the North End (most are reserved for residents and you need a permit), but there are some parking structures a few blocks away."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"There really isn't that much more to say than has already been said.

We are extremely healthy eaters but we also want delicious and innovative food.  We have traveled the world and have experienced culture through food.  This place checks a lot of my boxes in what delicious, creative, and comforting food should be.  We are not vegetarians but love vegetarian food that is executed well.  This is what Ichiza brings to the table.  The chef is of Filipino and Guam descent so he gives you a taste of his culture in his dishes but elevates it with a surprising and delectable twist.  If you share the same culture, his food will take you back and bring back some nostalgic memories of being home but yet wonder about the different flavors that are introduced with it.  I am Filipino and vegetarian restaurants are not popular back in the Philippines.  Filipinos love their meat so I was intrigued to find this restaurant.  I was not expecting much as I've been to many vegetarian/vegan restaurants that serve \\"fake meat\\" and let me just say that id rather have no meat than fake meat at times.  However, the chicken adobo here is a definite winner.  The rice was perfectly cooked, the marinade was perfectly balanced and the \\"chicken\\" was tender and juicy.  I might have forgotten for a minute that I was in a vegetarian restaurant....It was love at first bite! This is not just a Filipino restaurant, it is vegetarian asian inspired with strong hints of Filipino, Japanese, Chinese\\n\\n \\n\\nThis is a small simple casual yet cute and quaint restaurant that makes everyone feel welcome and eventually at home.

There are times you fall in love with a place for the food or the people but on rare occasions you fall in love with both.  Ryan and Cyrus are the perfect partners to run this business.

We tried the paella and mofongo - both huge portions and very good. The rice is really flavorful and I love anything that has chorizo as the paella does. Plus the salad dressing they use (a lot of the entrees come with a side salad) is so yummy - I think it's honey-mustard based. Weird to comment on, but my hushand and I found it noteworthy. This place is a real gem and if you're hestitating to try it, don't. The staff is super nice - the owners came out and shook our hands, asked how we heard of the place - and the food is reasonably priced and tasty."},{"name":"Taco Cabana","address":"9605 Research Blvd.","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Midnight, pipe burst in restaurant and no manager to help.
