But while working for a company that is completely Kosher (no outside food brought in pretty much) I had the choice of eating the lunch they prepared for us or going out for food. My co-workers took it upon themselves to educate me about falafel. (They also thought I could use a long walk since I was incensed at a client).\\n\\nSo enters my first  taste of falafel. I was absolutely enraptured with my first bite, crisp and crunchy, tart and tangy. Absolute heaven! Falafel itself is fried chickpeas and I need to learn to make this at home. Its interesting watching them make fresh falafel, they have this thing that makes perfect little falafels and drops them in hot oil. Sizzling hot when they are put into the pita. Delicious. This is a perfect meal if you have friends that keep Kosher or are vegetarian. Of which I have both so we tend to go to Rami's often. \\n\\nAs I no longer work in Brookline, I tend to stop by there every time I am in that part of town.

The stuffed french toast is a bit rich and heavy, so if you're not accustomed to sweets for your first meal of the day, share this item or eat is as a dessert. It's really good though: it's huge challah bread stuffed with strawberry jam and cream cheese topped with syrup, strawberries, and butter. My favorite was the braised pork and polenta though. The pork was tender and loved the taste of the polenta as well as the fried egg and the garnished grilled corn. I'll be back one day to try the chicken and waffles!\\n\\nThe menu selections are a bit on the more expensive side (french toast $9, pork $12) but keep in mind that these portions are pretty HUGE. I couldn't finish half of my food, so I believe you get your money's worth. The pricing is standard and similar to other places.\\n\\nI hope one day Brunch Haus expands it's menu in a brick and mortar shop. But for now, check out their amazing food truck for a delicious brunch!!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I had to check out this place after hearing bbq enthusiasts rave about it. I have to agree - it is the best bbq here in austin. Is it as good as ones in bbq cities like lockhart, luling, etc? Close, but not quite. I like to taste the smoky flavor in my bbq, and I couldn't taste it in the brisket that I had. I ordered the two meat plate and stuck with fatty brisket and pulled pork. They were both delish. The coleslaw was just meh, and the potato salad wasn't anything spectacular. Next time I visit, I'll be sure just to stick with the meat. =) The guy getting my order threw in a rib just for kicks, and it was pretty tasty! I'll have to order more next time.

The food is pricey for the small portions that you get, albeit not as ridiculously expensive as P is for Pie a few blocks away. I ordered their signature pie (which really shouldn't qualify as a pie since it only consists of a few bites (perhaps it's supposed to be seven bites like their name? Either way, not enough product for the price). It tastes weird to have a regular pastry crust over chocolate, and the interior is nothing special, even though the cashier told us that this was the product that launched their bakery. My husband got the espresso brownie, ate one bite, and could eat no more due to it being so crazy rich. He also got a coffee that had the most bizarre aftertaste. The cashier offered to let him have a sip of their iced coffee to see if he'd prefer it, but he thought it was worse. The owner passed by and asked how things were. We didn't want to tell her we disliked everything, because she seemed nice, so we just told her about the coffee. She gave my husband a sample of orange blossom tea (bleh!), and we ended up saying he would just stick with his coffee. She then offered water instead, which he accepted. I will say that the Italian water in the glass bottle was actually good. We took most of the dessert home, as I couldn't bear to throw it out after the high price we paid, but now it has sat in the refrigerator several days because neither of us could bring ourselves to finish it, so now I know there is no other choice but to toss it. Needless to say we have no reason to ever come back. The food and coffee would merit one star, but based on the decent service, I have boosted it to a two star."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Wasn't expecting this quality in such a touristy area.

Our waitress took a very long time to even acknowledge us, then dropped waters off and walked away when we wanted to order a drink. We finally flagged her down and were able to place our order. We were sure to order our food at the same time because we weren't sure when we'd see her again, and I'm glad we did because it took almost 20 minutes for her to come back with my drink. My boyfriend's drink never showed up, and when we asked our waitress about it, she said \\"Yeah, I know,\\" and walked away... leaving us feeling confused. Our appetizer was dropped off (it was amazing!), and we again asked about his drink. She sighed and walked away to type into a computer. We finished our appetizer, and his drink finally arrived a few minutes after. At this point, all the ice in my drink was melted and made it a bit gross to drink.

Everyone grabbed a drink of choice and waited a full 10 minutes before being sat at a round table.  Three baskets of chips were quickly brought over (and devoured) and we were left alone to look at the menu and talk.  It was nice to sit at a round table with that many people because it doesn't feel like Christs last meal, and then your stuck talking to Judas all night but I digress...everyone ordered and all the food came out HOT and at the same time.  I've eaten here many times and I think I'm stuck on the Chicken Fajitas.  I've tried the steak fajitas and the meat gets over cooked and I can't have that.  I tried the shrimp but they tasted more like what is used to clean the grill than ACTUALLY grilled shrimp.  Totally disgusting, but I still love Border.

The Campechano Flight of Ceviches, guac, pico de gallo is not to be missed. Too big an order for 1 person, it needs to be shared. The hubby goes for the meat Tacos, 4 for 11.50. Last time he had Asada, Carnitas, Tinga de pollo, Pescado. He liked a couple more than the others but there's a learning curve with taco eating, and it boils down to personal preference. The tacos were all well prepared and seasoned differently. An excellent deal for 4/$11.50. They also have veggie choices 4/$9.50. Me, I'm a creature of habit, I always order the Enchiladas Clasicas. A perfectly creamy spicy chicken enchilada plate that satisfies my every craving. This is not diet food, but my mouth is watering as I write this.

They were delicious, especially loved the hummus and fresh crisp veggies on top. Then we had the kale salad and chowder. Both were great, again. The kale salad was very tasty with crispy kale and light dressing, and the chowder was delicious, thick and full of seafood. For entrees we had the 1/2 chicken and the boar stroganoff. The mushrooms in the stroganoff were fantastic, and I just kept eating, saying I wanted to stop and save the rest for lunch, but couldn't stop eating. Finally I pushed it away and saved some. The chicken was moist and tasty, and saved half for the next day as well. Overall, a place we are sure to go back frequently.

With that being said she never checks up with us after 30 min of sitting there with empty glasses staring at her. She never looks our way. Or anybody's way for that matter she's just talking with her co worker about random crap. We eventually had to wave her down. She walks up the the resting B face. Ladies you know what I'm mean. We say two shots of house vodka. She pours so uneven when she brings them back to us it's obvious one side has more than the other. When we point that out to her. And wait. Here's the real kicker.... she grabs the one that has more and pours it into the lesser one. Hahahaha I couldn't believe that service. Any real bartender would've put more liquor from the bottle and apologized. But no. We didn't take the shots I was too flabbergasted. I'm still staring at her in shock when she says 22 dollars again. I'm like hold up, hold up, hold up.  That's what you charged us for the long islands? Which has more liquor in it and it was top shelf. You're trying to tell me it's 11 dollars for a HOUSE shot of vodka. No honey. I'm a bar hopper. That's not right.  She did yes because the Long Island is pre mix and listen to this\\"full of juice\\" phwhahaha. There's just sooo many things wrong with that statement.   I didn't see her make the drinks because I was talking with my friend staring in a different direction. Instead of arguing how  a Island does not have juice I tell her to keep her shots. I wasn't paying for it. She grabs the shots without saying another word to me and turns around to her friend saying hey we have shots. Done.

That was fun to see but loud if you were trying to talk to your friends.\\n\\nThe food was average at best. I ordered the pizza burger with fries. It was a hamburger with mozzarella and marinara sauce. I couldn't taste the cheese but the burger was okay. Not worth waiting an hour and a half for. The service was pretty bad too. The waitress wasn't attentive and didn't know simple things about menu ingredients. The menus is small as it is so to not know what was on a new burger was frustrating.\\n\\nBottom line is it's not a must go. If you'd even want to try it definitely make a reservation.

Not being cheapos by nature, we went a ways past the $60 to see what this place has to offer....\\n\\nWe started with a glass each of ume-shu (we loves the plum wine!), and decided... what the heck... let's get the more expensive one (mostly because we finished a bottle of the Takara a while ago ourselves...).  It was very very nice....  worth the extra $$$ over the Takara (but of course... it's still at restaurant pricing).   Definitely a try if you're here kind of thing.\\n\\nOnward to food...   we started with a little bit of sushi each...  the fiance is a cone-addict, so spicy chopped scallop for her, and for me... they had on the fresh sheet a Seoul Roll...  beef tataki (think sashimi here) with kimchi and spicy chili sauce.   The fiance found the nori was nicely heated up (something she wishes EVERY cone serving place would do), and the scallops were fresh and tasty.   Mine was... well, in her words... HOT!   For me... there was a nice heat to it... both kimchi and the spicy sauce lending their work there.  She only had one piece, I finished the rest (I didn't try hers... because me and seafood aren't such great friends).\\n\\nMains...   we tried a few plates on this one too...  beef short rib lettuce wraps, and one of our personal fav's (and no one has made it better in my opinion than the two of us when we made some to bring to a xmas party dinner for my co-workers).   Both dishes were....   meh.  They were ok... but nothing blowing my socks off.  And really... I wanted to like the place.  The decor, the ambiance... (and the point I'll get to later...) were nice....  the food just wasn't backing it up.\\n\\nOk... to desert....   Not my thing, but the fiance loves the sweets (me... I'd rather just order some more savoury).   We ordered the Umi Cannoli.  Umm... I'm guessing deconstruction was en vogue on this one... because I've had cannoli... locally, many different cities, and even in Italy (but no... not yet in Sicily... I have yet to fix that miss yet), and what I was served was in no way a cannoli.   It was a few wafers with paste on it, and some sliced strawberries.   There was a sour cream sorbet / ice cream on the side, and misc. chopped fruits on the plate as well too.  The sour cream thing was pretty good and the berries were nice, but the cannoli part was a let down (sigh... like most of the rest of the food).\\n\\nI guess if I'm looking for an upscale sushi place not quite at Tojo's standards or pricing, but higher than 90% of the rest of the joints...  then Hapa Umi would do well where it's sitting....   now... on to the kicker.\\n\\nThe service was....  PHENOMENAL!   Attentive but non-obtrusive....  handy with everything... quick with the food, and the clearing, but NEVER in a way that got in the way.   Between the hostess seating us... the server serving, the bus person assisting in many ways...   this was really a lesson that other restaurants should take note and maybe train a little or at least observe here to see how it really should be done.\\n\\nSo...  at the end of all this.... would I go back.   Not really.  At the prices (if I hadn't the 1/2 thing) it really wasn't worth it for the food.   I loved the service, but I'm going out to eat, so I'd better love the food....  and I didn't.   The bill before the discount hit around $90 for the two of us...   and really...  at 1/2 that, I'd have been ok with it....   maybe the kind of place that I'd go for someone else's birthday or something.   But at $90...   nope.  I could go to many other restaurants and get better food for that price in many genre's.\\n\\nIf I could get the fiance's permission to post the final picture I took of the meal (and that doesn't have much of a chance of happening)... you'd have seen a very sad, disappointed face...  hoping for so much more... but receiving so little food satisfaction....    and if you haven't been reading my reviews before... the fiance is Japanese, and sooooo  wanted this place to be a nice 'go-to' place for us.   *sigh*  we continue to search....."},{"name":"Sunshine Diner","address":"2649 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This diner is one of the better diners in Vancouver in my opinion.

We were told by the staff that they would probably be out of some meats by the time we reached the front but they would have plenty of the brisket that they were so cherished for. Well just as we reached the the front we learned that they had just run out of brisket! As you can imagine we were pretty disappointed after standing in line for nearly 5 hours to learn that the meat the they were famous for they were out of. So we had to settle for their second tier meats, which ended being compted by Bengie! That is something I can say I have never experienced at any restaurant just because they were out of a dish you were craving. Any how the beef bits and pulled pork were better than anything you will have in CA, the links were on point, and the banana bourbon pie was killer.

At least I wouldn't have to walk far to get a drink, was my thought. I ordered a Voodoo IPA and after a few minutes walked over to order my food. \\n\\nI asked for an original burger and asked for cheese on it, so they bumped it up to a cheeseburger. And along with that I asked for a side of hot wings.\\n\\nI returned to my perch and worked on my articles until I heard my name called over the PA system (about 15 minutes).  \\n\\nBut when I returned to my perch for the second time I noticed that there was no cheese on the burger. I checked the receipt and the paper that the kitchen had stabbed into the burger and confirmed that it said \\"cheeseburger\\". \\n\\nSo I got up again, went to the kitchen with my plate and explained what went wrong. \\n\\nThe guy working as the cashier started to argue with me and I explained that I had asked for cheese and showed him the receipt. \\n\\nSo he took the top bun off my burger, grabbed the patty and threw it on the grill.........with the same hand he had been working the cash register.

The bartender asked if I was done with the hamburger that was only cut open and I said \\"yes\\".\\n\\nThis is another side product or result of having two systems in a restaurant. In a more traditional restaurant the bartender would have asked if the burger wasn't to my liking....since it wasn't touched.But no such inquiry.\\n\\nI never saw a manager or someone who looked like one, nor did I ask to see one.

We skipped the \\"corn pancakes\\" everyone on Yelp was raving about and went for the charred broccoli with butternut squash hummus and the kale salad. The broccoli was one of the best vegetable dishes I've had in recent memory. I would literally come here just to buy this dish for dinner it was so good. The kale salad was a kale salad, but satisfying and had a great flavor and crunch to it. For some meat, we settled on the chicken fried rabbit - an interesting fried nugget of rabbit complemented by a blue cheese aioli. We then finished with the pig's tongue, which was way too salty - even the quinoa, which was served alongside it, was like eating a bag of salt. The staff graciously took that dish off our bill - which pushed the service at Alden and Harlow up to 5 stars.\\n\\nFor cocktails, I settled on the classic Mai Tai - this is not your mom's default standard at a local chinese restaurant. Well mixed, strong, and served with crushed ice, this one was gone fast.\\n\\nWe did inquire about the secret burger, but alas, it was out for the night (at 6:30pm on a weeknight mind you).

Not so here in fact that is why they got 4 stars from me, they have the best cheese fries I personally have ever had in my life, no lie.  They don't re-bake the fries with shredded cheese thrown on top, no they actually use a melted cheese and poor that over the fries and top it with bacon, the fries are so good I will want them next time I go.  It also turns out you can sub out brats or even vegan dogs for hot dogs so that sells me too.  They had so many combos of hot dogs that I wanted to try something, but we already wanted to try the little palace based on reviews of yelpers, but as it turns out we looked at the menu in the window of that place and ended up in the El Camino.

We came on a Saturday after a day of shopping at the San Marcos outlet. We got here around 530-6pm when the place opens and there was a line out the door already. What good about the location is that you can have one person wait and another can go across the street for some Tapioca at CoCo's (which was something I did). The wait was about 35-40mins to the counter, the food arrives pretty quickly after you order. So the total time from waiting to finish eating is about an 1 to 1.5hr. \\n\\nFood: it was good; all I can remember is that the broth was really really rich for my liking. I got the regular tonkatsu original and the fiance got the tonkatsu sho-yu... the portions are good (so no need to share). We also got the spicy edamame - those were okay, I probably won't order that again. The ramen broth of both soups were really rich in flavor and the pork that I got was super fatty to the point where I didn't really eat it. I don't normally eat eggs but the egg that comes with the ramen was really good (up to the yolk part - I couldn't do, but that's just me, so the finance ate that part). We left really really full and the feeling of eating a very heavy meal. All-in-all it was a good meal. \\n\\nRestaurant decor/layout: This is what I didn't like about the restaurant... there is one huge communal table in the middle of the place. There is this one table by the window where the people waiting in line and watch you eat. I was praying not the get that table, I mean how awkward is it for you to be slurping noodles and having hungry people just watching you eat. I mean there was a glass window separating you, which made it feel like you're in a zoo. You order at a counter where there's enough for 4ppl to sit at the bar (again its right next to ppl waiting in line... how awkward?).

Don't get me wrong, I love me some noodles & broth but until l recently the closest thing to an authentic ramen I'd had was the 10-for-$1 Marchuan varieties sold at the grocery store. I'm definitely an expert when it comes to the store-bought variety, but a novice when it comes to the traditional stuff.\\n\\nWith that said, Ramen Tatsu-Ya was very good, despite the long wait in line. We arrived at 4:30 p.m. on a September Saturday in advance of their 5 p.m. opening. There were probably a good 25-30 people in line ahead of us. the fact that the restaurant faces west meant that as the sun started to set, we were blinded with light and quickly drenched in sweat - not the best prequel to an adventurous meal. I'm sure there are ways the restaurant could improve upon this. \\n\\nAbout five minutes until opening, a restaurant employee set out a big jug of water and some disposable cups, which was helpful, but it would have been nice if it had been available earlier. \\n\\nOnce the restaurant opened, the line moved like a well-oiled machine and we made it to the counter by 5:15. We selected our poison and additional add-ins, as well as a couple of appetizers. Since Tatsu-ya only carries a few items, the food was served almost immediately after we reached our assigned seats. Unfortunately, the host seated us at a communal table, which my party did not mind, save for the fact that we were sitting immediately next to a few young children. Vair annoy. \\n\\nI ordered the #1 - Tonkotsu orignal with extra pork belly (\\"chasu\\") & marinated egg, and a side of Brussels sprouts and water, which cost me around $19.50 - a bit much, I thought. The Brussels sprouts were amazing, probably because they were drenched in so much sweet/sour sauce that they lost all discernible sprout taste and were in no way healthy, whatsoever. Get these. \\n\\nAll the flavors were very good. I especially loved the wood ear mushrooms, but I found that I probably could have done without the extra pork belly. In general, i found the broth to be way too salty (and I ALWAYS over-salt things) and in desperate need of some spice, too, so I would recommend ordering a spice bomb. It is served on the side so you are able to add as much or as little as you would like (similar to wasabi when served at a sushi restaurant). The absolute highlight for me  was the EGG. I can't even begin to describe how perfectly marinated and well-cooked the eggs were. I could eat them every day. \\n\\nOne thing worth mentioning, is that I felt like we were being rushed the entire time we were eating. Servers were constantly lingering, yet no one offered any water refills. I had barely put my chopsticks down to take a quick food break when a server took my bowl away. I didn't even have time to let them know I was still working on it. I understand there are others waiting, but we had been sitting for less than 15 minute at that point, and it really irked me. My party of 3 spent $60 for three glorified bowls of soup, we should at least be granted an uninterrupted 30 minutes of dining time. \\n\\nIn all, Ramen Tatsu-YA was a tasty experience once but I'm not inclined to wait in line for it again. It was a fun group event, but probably not a good idea for a first date or for when you are trying to get to know someone and need to have good table manners - ramen just doesn't lend itself to that.

This was the best service I've had to date on BuHi.  It's kinda funny that the best service happened to be at a buffet.  The owner/server/comedian and his wife were fantastic!

Waters remained filled and splitting checks for our party of 6 was a breeze.  They accept credit cards, even for transactions less than $10.\\n\\nThe quality of the food at the buffet was very good.  There were enough people there that they kept bringing out refills so everything was fresh.  They had about 12-15 different choices that were setup on 2 tables in the middle of the restaurant.  The food is served in buffet style pans with the small circular dish heaters underneath, although I don't think they were lit probably because they were turning over the dishes so quickly.\\n\\nMy favorite dishes in the buffet were the crispy chicken, eggplant with shrimp, and beef ball.  The crispy chicken was my favorite overall and was a crowd pleaser.  It was an excellent combination of salty and spicy.  Had it been a tad crispier I would've gotten out of my chair and started doing the Dougie.  Both noodle dishes were good as well.

Instead of a rum drink made with an egg yolk, try the Ango Unchained, a smokey, sweet, combination of rum, egg yolk, chestnut cordial, garnished with a perfectly formed star anise, which is sentimentally reminiscent of a fire place on a snowy winter's eve (if one could, of course, consume said fireplace). \\n\\nIf you're unafraid of your food looking like the creature it was wrought from, the Lobster Saos Nanas is, well, something to go bananas for (there aren't actually bananas in the dish...it was a play on alliteration...eesh, people).

My corned beef hash was awful, the horseradish sauce that covered everything but the eggs was so heavy and did not taste like horseradish-- I could not finish it. The eggs were good, but they're eggs. The golden waffle was not special-- I was expecting a crispy-on-the-outside, hot and soft-on-the-inside, thick waffle, but I received it warm and the edges were not crispy at all. I tried my boyfriend's fried chicken and I could see why people might like it, it was crunchy and a little spicy-- but not for me. The praline bacon was too much for me, too sweet, too greasy, too salty. The hush puppies were just greasy. The only thing I did not try was the sweet potato waffle. \\n\\nI really hated my entire experience, but it might be because this kind of food is just not for me-- very heavy, greasy, and uninteresting.

The food truck was always a festival favorite for me, and I figured I would love the restaurant. However, I was left underwhelmed. My corndogski in pepper batter--a selection I have had several times from the food truck-- was overcooked. In fact, it was cooked to an almost golden black. I also had a side of limp fries that had been \\"poutined,\\" which was not a good thing (note: I love poutine). I didn't finish either dish--mainly because I didn't want too, but also because the corndog and fry portions were giant. My lunch partner went with the fried pickle in regular cornbread batter, and it was delicious. Her fries (they only had cheese on them) were also much better than mine. The homemade mustard was excellent and a perfect condiment for both the corndogs and fries.

Yes, pretty pathetic but those were the cards I was dealt with in the Midwest.  So when I moved to Boston over a year ago I noticed a slew of RB places. Since I wasn't a fan it never registered on my radar. Well that all changed forever with my discovery of true RB heaven with SRB. \\n\\nI was passing thru the area one afternoon to get my haircut and I noticed a huge line of people outside waiting to order here. I discovered that once a year they roll back prices to what they were in the early 70s. Now price might lure you in but kick arse food will have you running back for more. I figured it was all gimmick. I was so wrong. Weeks passed so I decided it was time to loose my RB cherry and checked out the yelps in the North Shore. SRB came highly recommended so I finally took the plunge. \\n\\nYou will notice the retro dining area and signage. It harks back to the 60/70's but it is very clean and well care for. The staff and cooks are Greeks and one thing I know about Greeks is they can make some awesome food. It can be a bit of a barrier with the broken English trying to order but not a big deal. I decided to go with the Supreme Roast Beef Basket with BBQ Sauce, Fries and a Coke. The price was around $8.50 with tax. The RB is the most tender and delicious I have ever tasted. It melts in your mouth and the BBQ is sloppy and tangy. The shoe string fries are on par with McDonalds if your are a fan.

While Charlie's isn't the worst place I've eaten, its certainly not deserving of the praise I'm reading here.\\n\\nFirst, the positive:  Decor and ambience are very nice.  Warm, cozy, perfect lighting, fireplace in the corner.  It has the look and feel of an upscale, NW Portland-esque type of bistro, which is something The Couve is sorely lacking.  They have an impressive drink list, and the appetizers we ordered were decent.  Live guitarist playing in the background was a nice touch as well.  But that's where it ends for me.\\n\\nOur server, while attentive, was downright awkward and overbearing.  Having done my own stint as a server for a few years, I know there's a balance between being sure your tables have what they need, but maintaining enough of a distance so as not to be intrusive.  This guy was obnoxiously intrusive - not sure I've ever encountered anything like it before.  After letting him know we weren't in a hurry, planned to have appetizers and a couple of cocktails before ordering, he continued to come back to our table - I kid you not - every 5-10 minutes to see if we \\"had thought any more about the menu.\\"  At about his 3rd visit when we'd told him no, we hadn't looked at the menu yet in the last 5 minutes, instead of backing off or suggesting we just flag his down when we were ready, he actually said \\"Well how about I go ahead and go over our specials tonight to get you moving?\\"  Seriously?  Get us moving??  Do you want us to relax and enjoy our appetizers, maybe order another round before dinner thus upping our tab total and subsequently your tip?  Or do you just want us out of here ASAP?  Feeling pushed to order, we did so.  I chose an avocado chicken sandwich of sorts and was extremely disappointed:  the chicken was dry and crumbly, there was little to no flavor to whatever spread was on the sandwich, and the bun tasted dry and stale.  The other ladies in my party seemed to have better luck with their food, although each of them commented on how their dishes were pretty unremarkable.\\n\\nI really wanted to like Charlie's.

At first one of the cooks said that they were out of prepared chicken and warned me that it would take a while to get my salad ready. I assured him it was not big thing.  The soup came out first and was utterly delicious. Tangy, slightly spicy, and not too creamy. As a major fan of tomato soup, believe me, I don't say this lightly.\\nWhen the salad came out, the chicken was moist and grilled perfectly, so definitely worth the wait. The other nice touch was that some of the romaine in the salad had been grilled, which gave an awesome flavor.  All this, for a $9 salad? I remarked to my husband that this was the kind of salad you'd have to pay $13 for in the Pearl. \\nHusband's ginormous BLT (house-made bacon!) sandwich was also made with quality ingredients and love, and was summarily devoured. \\nAnd OMFG, can I tell you about these cannoli?

The reason why is because of the high prices and how small the amount of food was. After ordering I was actually pleasantly surprised at the portion that we got in the end.\\n\\nWe shared a whole deep fried chicken that was half sweet chili cinnamon  and half spicy. Knowing that it was a whole chicken it's obvious what you're going to get.  A couple of wings, legs, thighs, breasts...so on and it was plenty enough for two people to share even on an empty stomach. This dish also came with a side of pallet cleansing pickled radishes and a small plate of cole slaw for $21.95, not a terrible price when spit between a couple people. \\n\\nThe spicy chicken is actually very spicy but not overpowering. It has a delicious kick that made my eyes water a little but made my mouth water even more. The sweet chili cinnamon sauce was absolutely amazing to the both of us. Not spicy at all but tangy and sweet...the cinnamon is a perfect touch as we were both in fried chicken heaven!\\n\\nI have to say that the service isn't great..and the place can get crowded with really loud young kids that seem to think it's okay to clap their hands or snap or wave obnoxiously to flag down a waitress which might have something to do with it.

Their dessert looked very good, but we never got to eat it.  After we ate dinner we ordered dessert and 30-45 minutes later it still hadn't arrived.  We called over a manager and they explained desserts routinely take at least 30 minutes to arrive because they take care of the walk up counter dessert orders first.  What the heck?  You'd figure they'd take care of the patrons who are dining in first because they are the ones buying drinks and meals and spending the most $.  That's pretty backwards in my opinion.  Our server should have given us a heads up about this but they didn't.  We walked out just as our dessert order was ready after 45+ minutes and it was all melted...no telling how long it had been sitting around.

The batter reminded me of chicken fried steak. I loved it with the house hot sauce. The sweet potato waffle was super fluffy with a crispy top layer. Was not overly sweet and you get a light hint of the sweet potato. Very large portion.\\n\\nOne Biscuit + Sausage Gravy - $5.75 - Biscuit was buttery. Cut in half and topped with a very thick creamy gravy. Great to eat with the chicken above!\\n\\nPraline Bacon - $6.95 - 3 thick strips of bacon candied with brown sugar and peanuts. The salty, sweet, nutty was such an addictive combo. So bad but so good, I ate them all. Bacon CRACK!"},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I love the blackened tuna and the service is always great.

I came in around 3pm on a Sunday and it was busy, but the line was short and moved quickly. Their menu is pretty limited (pulled pork, ribs, chicken, sides), so you get your food very quickly. I placed an order to go, and tried:\\n\\n-Combo (1/4 Slab, 1/4 Bird, $9.95 + $2.50 Side of Mac n Cheese, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vcf04U3jNOdaDPZQfBG_sA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The ribs were super tender and falling off the bone (delicious), and the chicken was solid- both were really flavorful and didn't need bbq sauce, but they also tasted good with the sauce. I wasn't a fan of the bbq sauce on it's own since it's so tangy, but it was good with the meats. Highly recommended! The mac n cheese was also solid but not amazing.\\n-Slice of Sweet Potato Pie ($2.95, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jUrfo8RQ5zSjtJjTMNY8Hw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Solid sweet potato pie, but definitely on the sweet side and heavy on the nutmeg. I loved the buttery-ness of the crust though- recommended for any sweet tooth.\\n\\nOverall, Fat Matt's is a solid place to check out for BBQ, especially for their ribs and chicken. Prices are on the cheaper side since they're a casual place. Outdoor seating available but it's cooler if you sit inside. Parking that is close to the entrance is more limited, but I think they have additional parking in the side/back."},{"name":"Cured","address":"1825 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4.5","text":"Quintessential Boulder. \\n\\nNew favorite cafe.

The brisket was filled with extremely juicy and tender pieces -- I could see where the barbecue fans could find their recommendations, but it was also cooked extremely dry at some points.

Well, I can't say either was super, but neither was horrible!\\n\\nTrivia was on a Wednesday nite, I arrived with a group of 8 people - I had emailed the place to reserve a table 24 hours ahead of time like they told me on the phone. I even received a very friendly email back confirming this, and welcoming us for our first time there. Of course, when we arrived at 7.30pm, I had to ask 4 different people about our reservation and getting a table, apparently whoever answers the email doesn't actually work at that place?! Our waitress \\"M\\" showed was walking us to our table after a confusing 10 minutes, but then she went over to another table to chat for a minute as we just stood and waited in the middle of walkway. She came back and then pointed to our lopsided table in near the back wall under the gigantic TV. They did have alot of TVs available if you want to catch a game or whatever.\\n\\nThe seating for 8 was very small next to the bar, and you actually have to turn your body to walk through the aisle...The place is fit for small groups of 4 or less, most of the seats are booths unless you sit outside - which has a nice big firepit and is very warm on cooler days, but very smokey out due to people lighting up.\\n\\nWe were not given table service until about 30+ minutes into the nite when trivia was starting, probably the worst time to order during all the hecticness. It was super loud/noisy inside...Our waitress eventually got our orders in, though we really had to flag her down to get her attention throughout the nite. Refills were few and far inbetween. The food came out in 15+ minutes I think, and I had the Sublime Burger [yes, the one between 2 donuts...why not! :)]. I had read about it on Yelp and saw a photo, looked interesting...didn't taste that great but wasn't bad - had the soft sweetness of a glazed donut and the thickness juiciness of a burger medium-rare. I had read on the Cypress website/facebook that they hand-cut all their fries, so I was looking forward to it...apparently it's nothing special and very dinky/weak and oily. McDonald's has better fries!\\n\\nAt least the burger was not overpriced. Everyone else ordered food and drinks, I think it was ok - someone's hummus took 20+ minutes to make, even after all 8 of us had gotten our food served. Trivia was fun, that really cannot be ruined by anything! Yes it was loud and heard to hear, but we sat right next to the announcer...good questions.\\n\\nI also had a shared dessert, the icecream bar with bacon and black pepper...sure sounded interesting and I'm into trying to food, but when it arrived, it looked like a $1 icecream bar with melted chocolate syrup, old bacon and someone sprinkled pepper on it. Looked ok, tasted terrible - don't order it, price is not worth it $4.00, was charged more on my bill!\\n\\nAt the end, when everyone got their checks/bills, it was confusing. My bill was off, the price I was charged was more than the menu listed. Not a huge deal but I dont like that when you have to double check prices....and especially when all 8 of us got a required 20% gratuity tacked on! Wow, I've been to many many nice restaurants and never seen 20%, only 18% the most...and this is a pub/bar! The waitress even came back a couple times saying she made mistakes on the checks, once to charge someone 20% on their check because she forgot, and then at the end when most everyone had left and paid, waitress \\"M\\" came back saying someone didn't pay [or I think she didn't charge or got confused] and was short $16+ of the total amount.\\n\\nShe was there arguing with us, even though we already gave her our money/credit cards 15 minutes before...it really left a bad \\"taste\\" in my mouth of Cypress Bar. The waitress was very pretty, and nice and friendly, but she did not do well in [customer] service as a waitress. Not attentive enough [she looked like the only 2-3 waiter/esses there], not good with math...maybe she was new, or having an off day - but I would not go back there.\\n\\nPlus there's a $5 parking fee for parking in the private garage next to Cypress, very safe but $5 when it was empty and during the week. I think it would make more sense for them to charge during the weekend, or when it's getting full rather than all the time even when they aren't super busy. The street isn't much cheaper, about the same price but you have to walk a block or so...probably not so safe at night either from what I've heard.\\n\\nOverall, not recommended for groups. Trivia was decent, alot of teams were playing that nite :) Probably good for a sports bar and beer drinking atmosphere. Otherwise, nothing special or worth going back for."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Under $6 for a souped up burger is quite remarkable for its location.  \\n\\nI ordered the Sunday Morning burger, which has an egg, ham, cheese, and tomato jam on the burger.  Well, at least that's what the menu said, since when it came out it was bacon instead of ham.  Honestly, I'm not mad about that, I would have preferred bacon anyways. But for those who aren't as big of bacon fans (are they even real people?), it might be helpful to update your menu.  \\n\\nThe burger itself was quite good. Everything tasted well-prepared, and the kicker was definitely the tomato jam.  Really added a nice layer, where other condiments would not have worked nearly as well with these ingredients.  Perfectly satisfied my hunger, while not being too little or too much food. That being said, though, I wouldn't have minded some fries with it.

My husband and I went on a Friday night which may not have been the most opportune time as it was very busy and Fat Matt's cannot seat many.  From the time we got in line till we were seated may have been half an hour. In terms of exclusive restaurants wait times that isn't bad, but Matt's isn't exclusive. Honestly the wait and whether or not it's excessive is a personal thing. I didn't feel it was too long and the staff is helpful when getting you seated.\\n\\nThe menu isn't extensive, it's basically ribs, chicken, and the sides. But when trying bbq I always go with the ribs so the menu was as big as I needed it to be. We split a full rack which was more than enough food for two grown men. We also ordered a side of Mac & Cheese.  The ribs were amazing. The meat was fall off the bone good and the seasoning was on point. The sauce is already on the ribs when you get them and they do bring you extra. I think they put a mustard mix in the sauce, so if you like that, you'll love their sauce.\\n\\nUnfortunately many bbq joints lose points when it comes to the sides and this is where Fat Matt's has an opportunity to improve. The Mac & Cheese was a bit over cooked and somewhat bland. To be fair cooking a lot of any pasta is difficult, but I've had some amazing Mac & Cheese so I know it can be done.\\n\\nOverall I agree with the suggestions that Fat Matt's is good bbq and it's definitely worth visiting again when I come back into town. Lesson learned? Don't come at 7pm on a Friday and order a different side dish. Also lesson learned? Fat Matt's is good eating and they also had a live blues band!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Add a dab of their habanero bottled sauce and it really brings out the flavors. \\nPro: Cheese quesadilla was very good and different because it seems to be pressed in a panini maker. \\n\\nCon: chips with ceviche were store bought juanitas. I love me some juanitas but looking for freshly made chips or specially bought from a local producer if I'm spending $10 on the dish. \\n\\nCon: pastor tacos: pastor is not pastor. It was very dry and meat served Luke warm. It did not taste as if it was properly marinated. I don't know how else to describe it past some shredded meat tossed in a sauce then thrown on a store bought tortilla and 2 inch slices of pineapple dressed on top to make it pastor? Then many big chunks of onion and too much cilantro as garnish. \\nRice was average and the black beans were very delicious and saved the dish. \\n\\nCon: margarita tasted like store bought overly sweet lime juice and it was supposed to be spicy and instead was overly smokey. Can't remember the name of it. \\n\\nPro: break side ipa. Pretty cool to have that kinda beer on tap at a Mexican joint. \\n\\nMeh: Shrimp tacos: chipotle cream sauce that should be drizzled was clumped on top of a huge clump of avocado. Needs only a drizzle of chipotle, less avocado, and maybe add a red sauce. Again store bought tortillas. This dish is really close to being legit. \\n\\n\\nService: solid and our server was very kind and gave us the right amount of attention. People were all hustling around but in a calm cool manner. \\n\\nBill: $62ish + tip. \\nConclusion: apps/small plates we had were really good but it is hard to mess up a quesadilla. Apps can often beat main dishes at restaurants but this was night and day between the two. The tacos are the main dishes offered and pastor and shrimp tacos need some work. When I got the bill I didn't feel good about paying Casa Del Matador prices and got no where near the quality of food on a few items. Not that every place is or needs to be matador but they charge the same price point and don't serve juanitas. I think there are some controllable's that can be altered and immediately pick up the game of the food. Buy daily made chips or make your own. Buy tortillas made that day or make your own. \\nThe place is cool and the staff seems legit and you can tell that they believe in the restaurant. I would definitely go in again to try different dishes. This is a new spot and if you are reading this review and considering going here I strongly recommend trying a few different things. If I didn't get apps I probably would never know to go back. \\n\\nIt feels like a new restaurant trying to find its identity. They were able to keep up on a Friday night and were steadily busy the entire time we were there. \\n\\nSide note: consider changing your policy on your tacos. You can't pick a variety of taco types with the three taco dish. Almost EVERY place allows for this and I think a change will increase your chances of more pleased customers. I was pretty bummed that I went to my favorite pastor dish and ended up with three tacos I didn't want to eat and a $60+ bill. Who knows if I would have been in love with the barbacoa or something. Now I may or may not come back in to spend my time and money to risk it for round two to find out. \\n\\nThey had some cool looking plates with bacon, and deviled eggs that I want to try. They also had some vegetarian options like palenta tacos. Not something I would order but it's a nice touch to the menu.\\n\\nNice job on the place and am actually looking forward to trying out the food again to see the growth I would imagine will happen. It's one of those places that can easily rise to the top in the neighborhood.

You can't help but watch the waiter carrying the platters above his head to the empty place setting in front of a grinning guest.  The chimichuri steak ($11) is also a great meal, though it takes 15 minutes to cook, so enjoy the chips and dip while you wait -  they are free and you can get all the refills you want.  The atmosphere is loud and celebratory, the tables are packed, and the walls are lined with Corona ads, chalk drawings, year-round Christmas lights, and lots of bumper stickers, street signs, and promotional material.  It feels like the local tex-mex place that has always been on the corner.  Service is prompt and they work really hard.  They won't linger in conversation at your table because they have so many guests to get to, but the staff - and I've been here 35+ times - is very helpful in explaining orders and accommodating requests.  While the margaritas rock, I think the sangria is lacking.  Also, there is always a 20+ minute line on Thurs, Fri, and Saturday nights.  They will not seat you until your whole party is present, so you cannot grab a table and wait for your buddies to arrive.  It's a hot-spot for undergrads, grads, and local people - a true mix of Cambridge residents.  If you have a 30-45 minute wait in the winter, pop over to Starbucks across the street or to The Market down the street for warmth.

I rank these on par with Shake Shack (and both are better than Tasty Burger, by a long shot, IMHO). \\n\\nEDIT: \\n\\nThe first time I went here... things were looking good. I was enchanted by the pseudo-fast food style burger. But then.... I bit into a piece of string! Not thread, but big, thick, white string, tied in a little loop and everything. It was cooked right into the pattie. Nasty, nasty. But I gave it a second chance. This time, the bottom bun had two bright red splotches on it. NOT the same color as the juices dripping out of the burger... dark red, like it had been dipped in raw meat juice. Still, I tore the spots off and persisted (what can I say?

I was very disappointed. Luckily I only paid $19 because of my educator discount.  I would not have paid one cent more because it was not worth it.  First off we entered and was escorted to an open area where they serve some appetizers.  The appetizers were awful.  One was chicken salad with some hot fries on top.  They did not have any beverages to drink unless you ordered it.  Be very patient if the bartender is talking to a girl, you may wait a while for your cup of $2.50 soda.  The meal itself was not great.  They give you half of a chicken that tasted fresh out of the microwave and potato and some vegetables.  There is no creamy soup just salad.  The salad was one tomato and some lettuce and your choice of Italian or ranch dressing straight from a ketchup bottle.  The show itself was not that great.  A villain trying to capture a princess and gyspy that was twirling around.  Towards the end there is a dragon, I don't remember dragons as part of the pirate genre, put in this play there is.  Then at the end they give you a suggested tipping guide, $5 per adult and $3 per child.  Be prepared for a lot of singing, some passing around a bag and some audience members playing games.

I sort of want to give it four, but it's just not that amazing. It's good. It's really good pub food, they make excellent drinks, and they have a good beer selection. However, in comparison with other similar options in the region, it's just not phenomenal. But it is a good place to get a burger (the English on the English muffin is pretty tasty, and the Andouille is a more interesting but still delicious burger) and their fries are nice and thick-cut. They are not, however, the burgers that I could get back in the Midwest (sorry, it's true), nor do the fries hold up on that scale. I fear that living in Missouri for a year, being the fatty and fried Midwest, has sort of shifted my ability to judge such things. It's also not helpful that I had Craigie on Main's burger fairly recently. That, which is pretty much like ground up filet, shouldn't even be called a burger. But it is, and it too has tainted my judgment. \\n\\nBut that said, Christopher's burgers are also entirely reasonably priced for what you get, and you get a whole lot of food. I've heard very good things about their black bean burger, and have every intention of getting it in the next couple times I go there. I've also sampled two different fish and pasta specials. They were both good, but slightly less than phenomenal. However, their short ribs that they had on special, which were a sort of barbecue flavored affair, were delicious. Hands down the best thing I've had there. And I'm coming from one of the undisputed barbecue capitals, and I have to give them this one: those are some very tender (if yes, fatty) short ribs (they're going to be fatty, that's the thing with short ribs). The mashed potatoes they come with are an excellent support, even if the other accompaniment, some broccoli, doesn't hold up to this level. Again, it's pub food. The vegetables aren't even supposed to hold up. \\n\\nSo it's good. It's somewhere to which I will happily return. Their staff has always been super friendly and very good to us.

It is definitely the best.  You've seen this place on TV, you've read the reviews and there is no substitute for tasting it for yourself, but I came from California on a mission to try the best BBQ spots.  I went to spots in San Antonio, Houston and Austin and this is the best BBQ spot (maybe in the world, but I need to try many others to support that claim).  Anyway, it is superior to the competition.  The ribs, the brisket are amazing.  So tender, great flavor.  Just plain amazing.\\n\\n#2 - With great regret I have to say that YES, it IS worth the wait.  I almost wanted this place to disappoint so I could write about how you shouldn't go there and try something else that was practically as good.  After all, you gotta be crazy to wait 4+  hours to get food, right?  Yes, you do have to be crazy.  The thing is, it really is as good as everyone says it's going to be.  I tried other BBQ spots (as mentioned above) and loved the experiences, but this is a unique experience that is worth the wait.  When you open up your package you'll instantly see how tender the meat is because the rib meat will fall of the bone on its own.  It's so soft and gentle that you almost want it to stroke your head at night and put you to sleep like a baby...  And the flavor?  Perfect.  Nice mix of spice.  For my taste, I could do with some additional heat (all Texas BBQ seems to be light on spicy hotness) but the sauces help a bit there.\\n\\nA couple of other notes:  The sausage is definitely a distant 2nd / 3rd to the ribs and brisket.  I'd pass and focus your taste buds on the magic of the other meats.  And, as far as the line goes, not a lot of options.  It's not too bad if you come in with the right attitude.  At least the people are nice.  Mostly visitors (like me) but some locals too.\\n\\nAll in all, if you are the kind of person who needs to have the best or experience the IT place in every city you visit, you gotta come to Franklin's.  I know everyone else has said it, but it is worth it.  Just bring some good reading material or stay off of your favorite social media platform for a few days so you have a lot of catching up to do :)"},{"name":"Chez Jose Mexican Cafe","address":"8502 SW Terwilliger Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a really generous 2-star review.

As a party of three, we decided to sample all selections on the prix fixe menu. I had the tortellacci appetizer, my husband the shrimp gouda flatbread and my son the veal stuffed banana pepper-and of these, the hands down fav was the stuffed pepper that was spicy and tender stuffed with delicately seasoned ground veal and topped with a generous amount of cheese and smothered in tomato sauce.  The  flatbread was very light and spiced to perfection while the tortellacci was a beef-stuffed pasta and meatball too heavy for my taste, but perfect for the two large appetites sitting across from me!\\n\\nThe Entrees we had were ENORMOUS!!!!  My son had the 22oz prime rib seasoned and cooked to order which also came with a bulb of roasted garlic-yes, the whole dang bulb-YUM!!! My husband had two of the best JUMBO lump crab cakes I have ever tasted.  They were subtly sweet and perfectly cooked and spiced with almost no breading whatsoever-served with a light and mildly tangy tartar sauce. For the Pi√®ce de R√©sistance, I had a T-bone sized veal chop lightly breaded and cooked to absolute perfection served atop an arugula and cranberry salad.  This chop was as big as my head!!  I love veal and have eaten it in Rome, Venice and Naples Italy, but this was the best cut of veal I have ever been served! \\n\\nDessert choices were also molto bene!!  I have never been a fan of cannoli....until I had the killer cannoli at Stefano's, that is!  Made in house, it was the perfect balance of mascarpone and pastry.

It has standard Brazilian steakhouse fare and style, but the price is quite high.  Around $40 for dinner (just for the food, and not including dessert or anything other than the meat and the salad bar).  The biggest problem I had here, and it is a HUGE problem is a seeming dishonesty with the operation.  CHECK YOUR BILL....TWICE.  They added drinks that we never ordered to the tab, and worst of all, they were over charging us for each glass of wine that was ordered (charging different than what was listed on the wine list).  It wasn't necessarily about the $1.25 extra per glass, the problem is that their computer system had a different price than the menu.  When we asked one of the waiters about this and I explained that this was quite dishonest and obviously they were overcharging everyone that ordered the house wine for who know how long, he replied that they \\"just changed the wine list and didn't update the computer yet, and that they were doing it right now, as we spoke).  Convenient, and yes it is possible that they just changed the wine list, but from the overall feeling of the night (no prices on the dessert menu, which makes one think that it may be included, as well as some other small strange things), I get the impression that if they changed their wine list and put a more expensive wine as the house, I am sure that change would have been made immediately, though since it was in their favor to not update it immediately, I take it they weren't in any rush to change the computer's price.  After a good meal, this left a very bad taste in my mouth.

And here is why:\\n\\nService: it was good, more like an aiiiiite. Our waitress started out great. My sister ordered an iced tea, and just water for me. She refilled the first glass of tea when it was empty and asked if we wanted fried bananas. But things went downhill with her service from there. I had to ask to refill our drinks 3 times. She didn't really come back to check on us. We had to ask if they made that cheesy roll like the ones they have at Fogo, which they did and she brought it out to us. She kind of redeemed herself towards the end of the dinner. When we asked if they had chicken hearts or beef ribs, she made it happened and got us what we wanted. This made us happy. But the fact that I had to ask for things knocked off a star from this review. \\n\\nFood: very good for the most part. Some stuff was overcooked. I'm a medium rare type of girl, so I was not digging on the well done meat. We learned after eating a few pieces of well done meat to ask how the meat was cooked before taking it. Pasta bar was great! I had a good portion of cream pesto fettuccine that was delicious. We had a chocolate mousse for dessert and it was just heavenly. \\n\\nPrice: $39.95 per person at dinner is not bad at all... BUUUUUT the mandatory 18% gratuity knocked off the other 1/2 star for me. If I had a big party (6+), then I wouldn't have an issue with that. But there were 2 of us. We were not using any Groupon, no coupons, no deals, nothing that would justify charging the 18%. I also didn't recall seeing that anywhere. If they were so confident on their service that they're charging 18% tips automatically added to the bill, then I should expect superior service, or at the very least, keep my water filled without me asking for water throughout my dinner!!! I usually tip at least 18-20% if I had a good experience, but I have to say the service provided at this dinner was NOT deserving the 18%.\\n\\nOverall, I had an enjoyable dining experience. I would recommend this place to others, but the wait staff really need to improve on their service."},{"name":"The Arlington Restaurant & Diner","address":"134 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"I sometimes stop by here when I want a bad eggs benedict.

The pizza was spicy and flavorful, and all the ingredients complimented each other well (honey sriracha crust, honey sriracha drizzle, peruvian peppers, and hot peppers  all meshed well and nothing was too overpowering). I especially applaud the shift manager, Milton, who was kind and patient while I struggled to decide which crust I wanted to try first. Be sure to ask for a small cup of drizzle on the side!

This is not your cookie-cutter caf√©. If you want to walk into a joint and feel as if you've been there a thousand times, I strongly suggest that this is not the place for you.\\n\\nThis place is dynamic in strengths, and shows it well through a consistent change in the food and drinks that it serves, as well as the art that it displays.\\n\\nLet's start with the food - their cr√™pes are consistently on-point. They currently have a tofu salad with an amazing peanut sauce, which I'm craving right now (I usually don't like tofu). You can always expect the same from their sandwiches, but only in the sense that you'll be full and satisfied after consumption - they seem to go with the flow, with regards to what goes in them. As for their baked goods? BACON CHEDDAR MUFFIN. A glorious foodstuff that may only be improved by the presence of maple syrup. Muff said. \\n\\nNow, the sips. They don't go all-out Baskin' Robbins with their coffee, which I like. They do a bit more than just your usual stock options, but not too much more. If you like coffee - I mean, ACTUALLY like coffee - then you should like this place. They have quality beans, and use them well. Any flashy options are done in good taste, from my experience. And the latt√© art that the young gent barista does is much unlike the generic norm. Interesting tea selection, though I haven't delved into it yet. \\n\\nLet's top it off with the physicalities, no? The ~monthly rotation of local artists' work is usually rather impressive, and the space is well utilized to suit it. The layout is open and welcoming, and it really suits the character of the place, as the people working there are always amicable and upbeat. The furnishings are aesthetically pleasing, finding a soft balance between wood and leather - which I personally enjoy. The coffee bar is situated in the bright, windowed side, with dining tables and a sexy, comfy couch in the inner sanctum, where you can watch the cooks work on your meal in the open-concept kitchen.\\n\\nAll-in-all, this is the perfect neighbourhood caf√©. I honestly go out of my way to spend time there. And my only issue with it is that more coffee shops can't be as genuine and community-oriented as this one. Oh well. As long as there's that big red rooster stencil in the window, welcoming me home, I'll have the culinary and caffeinated escape that I crave so much."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

There was cafeteria style seating, and the kardashians were everywhere (their looped video is not necessary).  The menus was huge with mainly drinks, which was a good variety (and definitely all of them are hangovers waiting to happen), the only details missing were the actual types of liquor the drinks are made with. I do not drink vodka, and I guess all the drinks are made with vodka because the server was only able to recommend 1 drink that wasn't vodka based. The burgers are very tasty, but the fries are a big fail. they are soggy and cold.  They are still working out their new restaurant quirks, but I noticed that the servers are not prepared to handle big parties. Our server had us, a table of 4, the table next to us, and a table across the restaurant with a party of over 10ppl, which basically kept him lost to us on the other side. This place is poorly organized, and they need to step up their food game given all the restaurants they have to compete with in walking distance.

The spicy citrus edamame started off our meal, and zinged with just the right touch of citrus, heat, and oil.  The seared chiles that came with the edamame were marinated in that same mixture, and they were fantastic as well.  I don't think you're actually supposed to put the chiles in your mouth, but that didn't stop me when I was two, and it doesn't stop me now.\\n\\nThe noodles themselves were even better.  I ordered the hot noodles with the miso broth, which came with soft, nicely textured ground pork; napa cabbage (which I believe was roasted just enough to caramelize a bit, though I could be wrong on this); and noodles that magically never bloated even after sitting in broth.  As for the broth itself, the spicy miso, pork, oil, and whatever other shit they put in there combined to make a decadently rich, filling, flavorful broth.  All of the flavors were well-balanced; none dominated over the others.  If I had any complaints about the food quality, it would be that the food is perhaps a bit *too* rich--there's a lot of oil and piggy grease going on in that bowl--but it's still very satisfying.\\n\\n...So why only three stars, you ask?  In short, it was because they were dicks about me taking my leftovers home.\\n\\nLong version:  I liked this broth so much, I wanted to take the leftovers home with me, because they would lend a fantastic flavor to a number of dishes.  So, I asked a waitress for a take-out box, and she replied that they didn't have any.\\n\\nThat's kind of odd, I thought.  I just assumed they wanted to save costs or be more environmentally friendly, and so I went to Coco's Cafe next door and bought a take-out container for $.50.  Yes, I wanted my leftovers badly enough to actually get up, go to another establishment, and pay extra for a receptacle in which to pour that liquid gold.\\n\\nWhen I started pouring said gold in said container, though, a hipster waiter came over and started hovering over my table, demanding to know where I got that container.  I told him, and he said \\"Normally, we don't allow people to have take out containers.\\"  I looked at him incredulously, and he continued, \\"yeah, it won't be very good later.  It's just a quality thing...we take this stuff very seriously.\\"\\n\\nI was taken aback.  You mean, sometimes leftovers aren't as good as when they're served fresh?  Holy shit, someone call the Swedish Academy of Sciences and nominate this man for a Nobel Prize.  Of course, this is a transparent and ridiculous excuse.   Leftovers from nearly any restaurant aren't going to be as good as the dish when it's freshly served, yet I've NEVER been to any other restaurant that wouldn't allow take-out boxes.\\n\\nI suspect the real reason is that they don't want people taking home the food and reverse-engineering the ingredients--but again, if this were a legitimate concern for them, it would be an equally legitimate concern for any restaurant.  Yet, this is the only establishment I've ever seen who harasses their customers about taking home food THAT THEY PAID FOR WITH THEIR OWN MONEY. \\n\\nI politely told the waiter that I paid for this food, and was going to take it home.  He protested again.  I took the food anyway, but not before another waiter came by and made a passing comment about it.\\n\\nSo overall, this was a very annoying and unnecessary sour note to an otherwise excellent meal.  Let the take-out thing go, guys.  It's pretty standard operating procedure, and making a stink about it is only going to piss off customers and cost you business in the long run."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"7550 Highcross Blvd.","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Went there on a Weds night for a holiday celibration with coworkers.

Everything was enjoyable but the standouts for me were the eggplant kofta, short rib, and butter chicken with smoky crisp cauliflower.

The wine selections were very good and being a pasta freak, I was very pleased with the selections available on the menu.  I ordered puttanesca, and some wine, and my friend ordered the risotto cakes.  After ordering, you have to try to grab a free table, which can be difficult at times, as this is a very popular place.  Water is self-serve, but they bring your food and beverages to the table.  \\n\\nBoth my friend and I enjoyed our entrees and wine immensely.

I see business dinners happening, but my mind doesn't work that way. i.e. no romantic evenings with the guys from NY...\\nThis ranks in the top places to eat in Atlanta.  You can pay a bit more, but you don't get a much improvement for your dollar.  In other words, this is about as good as it gets. \\n\\nI like sitting near the fire place.  They have a raised \\"balcony\\" area the corner table there is nice.  It can be slightly noisy - if you plan to have long conversations try to avoid the middle seats.\\n\\nMy only complaint, years ago when this was Hedge Rows Heights, you could pre order a chocolate souffl√© to be cooked while you ate the main course... This was one of the best desserts on the planet.  Now only available as cooked by my wife.\\n\\nReservations are highly recommended. \\n\\nValet parking is available next to the building. It's a small lot.\\n\\nOne of my pet peeves - diners underdressed for the restaurant - doesn't seem to occur here.\\n\\nThe menu changes daily so I will not attempt much by way of description.\\nSome of my past favorites -Venison medallions with cooked grapes was just unbelievable - this from a few years back.  We recently had some of the best crab cakes imaginable as an appetizer.

Gourmet cheeseburgers have their time and place, and many of them can be outstanding, but the whole phenomenon is a bit like dressing a redneck up in a Gucci suit. It's still a redneck! Ergo, it's still a damn cheeseburger! Take the redneck/cheeseburger for what it is.

Here, I only had to substitute olives for pineapple on my House Special combination, which I was able to do for no extra charge.\\n\\nI also enjoy that they have desserts other than some sort of cinnamon coated bread concoction. When I order pizza, the last thing I want is MORE BREAD for dessert, considering that bread is a fundamental ingredient for pizza. \\n\\nAnyway, I tried the Mud Pie. It didn't seem homemade, but it was delicious, nevertheless, and I would order it again. \\n\\nAs for the pizza, I thought it was pretty good. The pizza I ordered was really messy  (due to all of the toppings). This is more of a fork and knife sort of pizza, as the dough is soft and supple, rather than thin and crunchy. They were very generous with the cheese, which I liked. And all of the ingredients were flavorful.

After 15 min, we still hadn't received our drinks or queso. Finally the drinks come, but our margaritas are  IN PLASTIC standard PITCHERS! I asked the server why we didn't receive the tall, beautiful glasses and she informed us that they were \\"out\\". Meanwhile, we are still waiting on the queso as we watch server after server pass our table with the beautiful tall pitchers for their tables. Finally, we stop a random server and inquire about our queso. He found our server and inquired (we were in earshot of the conversation) he asked her why hadn't we received queso that we ordered and said she didn't know. Finally after another 10 min, the queso comes, sent by another random server, but only one out of the two we ordered. Then our server comes and informs us that she was sorry about our wait, and that another large party moved around, from table to table, making it hard for them to track orders and cash them out. What??? Okay, we get that you need to collect money, but we have been without attention from our server. By now we are out of chips, and our queso is getting cold, while we wait for more chips. We order another pitcher and I ask very politely if we could PLEASE have it in the tall, glass pitcher as we wanted to have in in our photos with the birthday boy. She says okay. 10 min later she comes to our table AGAIN with ANOTHER plastic standard pitcher and informs us that they were out of the tall glass pitchers. By now I am quite irritated because after all the beers, cocktails and THREE pitchers of Margaritas, we couldn't get attention or consideration from our server. Anyways, We spent well over $375 (pre- tip and some checks were from the bar) and got a total of five minutes of time from our server. The food was pretty tasty. VALET: We received our car back with the AIR on full blast and the gas 1/4 less than what we had when we got there. We really believed valet relaxed and chilled in our car while we were in No Mas. There was no need for climate control to be touched as we didn't have any heat or air on we we got there. It was a comfortable 63 degrees outside last night.

You can virtually choose anything on their menu and you can't go wrong!  It's only been 1 day and I'm already excited to go back to try more of their fabulous breakfast choices.

My friend said that she wasn't expecting a history lesson on chicken.  It was undercooked, end of story.  He did not add the fried chicken to our bill.\\n\\nFried Catfish - My other friend said she liked the catfish but that the portion size was too small for the price.\\n\\nGrilled Trout - This was the entr√©e that I ordered. It was lukewarm, small portion for the price and not really seasoned to my liking.\\n\\nChicken Casserole - My other friend said it wasn't what she expected. It too was a small portion size.\\n\\nSIDE ITEMS\\nMac & Cheese - It came out lukewarm.  I didn't care for it.  To me, the cheese looked like a liquid cheese sauce. But my friend told me that it was made with real cheddar.  She actually liked it.  I prefer mac & cheese that has a thicker consistency of cheese.  She agreed with me that the temperature was lukewarm.\\n\\nRoasted Potatoes - This was a tasty dish.  The potatoes were seasoned well and had bacon included which added to the flavor."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice beer selection, friendly staff, cozy & comfortable environment.\\nThe veggie burger isn't anything special...but I had to try it given the other yelp reviews.

It was a simple order really. After coming here for a Yelp event the next time around, I knew better. Just a burger and smash fries for me. A safe, small order-- or so I thought. In actuality my stomach betrayed me and ordered a large smash burger with a ton of extra toppings, ( most of which were free, but if you order over 5 of lettuce, tomato, pickles, ect, they ring it in to the register a bit differently price wise so make sure you pay attention)  and smash fries which are tossed in a salty garlicky rosemary blend. \\n\\nI popped a squat at one of the cute booth tables and played around with my number cue card as i patiently quieted my belly grumbles. Then at last the smiley waitress drops off my burger and fries. Fun fact: the larger sized smash burger is not worth it. It'a a lot bigger but the bread stays the same size, which is annoying. Also fun fact, the bacon bbq burger is amaaazziiiiinnngggg. The BBQ sauce has cranberry infused in it making it this sweet complement to the thick and salty bacon strips on top of a juicy burger and fluffly plump bun. The smash fries were hot and delicious and shoe string style so four at a time if the perfect vehicle for all my ketchup needs. \\n\\nAfter devouring said meal I tried to just get up and leave. I really did. But the booth seating and the waitress who so frequently came over and asked if she could get us anything else really got me thinking about those shakes. Thick and sweet the salted caramel was calling my name. So I succumbed ( you have to go back to the register for ordering extra things, but the waitress still brings them to your table) and boy did I not regret it. Salty crunches of pretzel with sweet caramel served in a glass mug and a silver cup filled with the extra makes for a milkshake and a half. So worth it. \\n\\nFew additional details:\\n\\n- Smash burger is a chain with a local twist for most of its menu items\\n- it's fast food with added table service but no tip\\n- the sell beer, cider and wine\\n- Try a milkshake. Just do it. thank me later.\\n- They have a truffle and mushroom burger for like 7 bucks.

Anyways, I got the salad, baked beans, macaroni and cheese and onion rings. Everything is delicious except maybe the salad - I mean, it was just a basic salad. Lettuce, tomato and onion. The ranch dressing was really good though, not sure if they make it on site or if it's bought somewhere. The baked beans were sweet and good, and the macaroni is creamy.

I hadn't had Pizza Hut in several years.  I remembered their cheese and marinara being kind of gross.  This is speaking as a person who pretty much likes all pizza.  \\n\\nHut Favorite breadsticks pleasantly surprised me.  Not sure if they measure up to Dominos' Cheesy Bread but still pretty good for $4.  I like that the breadsticks were very customizable--you could get any of the 8 crust flavors on the breadsticks.  Hut Favorite was sort of like garlic bread.  The marinara sauce that came with it was a little too sweet for me and masked the flavor of the breadsticks.  \\n\\nSweet Sriracha Dynamite was not bad.  It was the honey sriracha crust with honey sriracha drizzle. It was sweet and spicy--great if you like these flavors on pizza but otherwise you should avoid it.  Pineapples were sweet and peruvian cherry peppers were spicy.  The cherry peppers were hotter than I expected but I liked the spiciness.  I got the pan pizza crust so it was a little thicker.  The cheese tasted a lot better than I remembered, so I guess they've upgraded their cheese.  One thing that might put people off is that the sriracha drizzle can get absorbed into the thicker pan pizza crust.  Not too greasy but if you're a fan of the super crispy and dry Bertuccis/Upper Crust pizza crust, the sauce drizzles in general might not be for you.  \\n\\nNote, this place doesn't have any seating so you have to carry out.  The other ratings have said that this place always gets orders wrong over the phone or via online ordering.  I ordered in person and they got my order right.  Milton, the shift manager, was good about answering questions and making recommendations about their new crusts.

The coffee was amazing (they serve unlimited Stumptown!) and we also ordered the Bloody Mary which was top notch and spicy.

It took maybe 35-40mins for our food to arrive after ordering.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles and the Catshead biscuit sandwich. Chicken and waffles were delicious (and quite a lot to eat) 3 large chicken pieces piled high. I added the house hot sauce to give them an extra kick. The Catshead was even more delicious! The biscuits was fluffy, served with a piece of fried chicken and topped with creamy-good gravy. I would absolutely recommend both dishes and this restaurant.

I was also very impressed with the chashu in the #2 -- tender and cooked to perfection. The availability of extra eggs, bamboo, and fish cakes was a nice touch.\\n\\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, while the broth is excellent, the noodles are a bit off. Hard to put my finger on it exactly, they just didn't taste like ramen noodles, more like egg-based vermicelli. They were missing the springy, light, chewy texture that makes typical ramen slurpily good. Hopefully the owners, who clearly have an eye for detail, will revamp the noodles in time.\\n\\nWe also ordered gyoza and spicy edamame. The gyoza were OK, savory but a little soggy.

Not that Smashburger isn't a chain... it is... but it's new and the small business owner gets my vote until I have a reason not to...\\n\\nI got a haircut around the corner yesterday from Smashburger and have wanted to try a burger there since it opened.  It's a strip mall location which can be challenging for restaurants so I was interested in what I would see when entering not having been to a Smashburger before.  The restaurant was JAMMED with employees and all the employees were kids.  I would guess there were at least 12-15 employees in the restaurant at the time with approximately 5 customers in the restaurant.  Most of the kids were probably training but clearly there were more employees than jobs to do.  I was a kid and had a job in a restaurant as a kid.  Kid's are fine but it's REALLY hard to find kids who are GREAT in the service industry.  A balance of adults and kids usually helps and having a manager with a customer facing presence is always a good idea.  \\n\\nThe checkout process was fine.  I placed my order to go.  Burger and fries - no onion on the burger.  While I waited I watched.  One employee got his own food for break and ate at a booth.  Most of the employees were talking to each other but they were enough employees to make sure progress was happening.  \\n\\nAs I walked out, being somewhat of a cynic (as you can tell) about service I literally imagined writing a yelp review that included \\"After I took the onions off my Burger that was ordered 'no onion', the food was solid.\\"  I nailed it.  I ate in the car and after having the Smashfries, which were good.  Rosemary, thin fries, crispy and hot.  I opened the burger (the plastic clamshell is actually too big for the bag) I had to pull my onions off first thing.  I checked the receipt to see if the order had been taken correctly and it had... No Onion.  The burger was good.  Meat, bun, toppings... all good.  I would say the burger seemed a little healthier and less greasy than 5 guys but it wasn't a \\"drive across town for it\\" burger.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, while some may say \\"Gimme a break\\"... something like this experience makes or breaks a restaurant.  Owners must take every minute of every day seriously and go above and beyond to ENSURE the customer experience is top notch - to survive.  The world has plenty of burger places... you have to stand out.\\n\\nThe pizza place in my town that opened about a year ago seems to have chosen the same path.  They opened with many low-cost young employees and the service there was really sub-par.  It seems that the pizza place has taken cues from customer feedback and augmented their staff to ensure a higher level of service.  Again, it's not that kids are bad... but TRAINING and monitoring are huge if you have a young work force.  \\n\\nI write all of this hoping the owner sees it.  I want them to be successful.  Perception is reality.  An order being correct and a professional service staff are bare minimums that should happen with 100% regularity.   Going above and beyond this where you start to try to win raving fans of your business.\\n\\nBottom line the food was good.  I would go back if convenient.  I would love to see a manager's presence and receive a correct order the next time I go.\\n\\nCheers"},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice space with a lot of easy seating.

I love a good reuben, and finding good lean corned beef is a rarity these days.  Zaftigs in Brookline used to be my go to place, but even they up-charge for lean corned beef now.  When I saw a reuben on the menu at Sola I was skeptical.  I asked the cashier if the corned beef was truly lean, he got one of the people who made the sandwiches and they got me a good sized sample to taste myself.  It was excellent, reminding me almost of a savory brisket, plus it was lean!  I got the reuben as a result and it didn't disappoint.  One of my friends got their turkey which was also excellent.  They slice the meat to order and you can see the juices running down, it was great.  My one gripe is that the inside of the place is a bit of a disaster zone, there are boxes and other crap all over the tables.  It's very messy and there's no place to eat inside.

The biscuit sandwich with grits didn't stand out.

A hankering for biscuits  with a choice of country sausage or vegetarian gravy is also an option if a light breakfast doesn't seem like it'd be enough.\\n\\nA shared appetizer of hushpuppies (I prefer honey over their pepper jelly dipping sauce but only because of personal preference) and a small helping of their chicken and andouille gumbo is also a nice way to ease into the main meal.

After sampling a variety of their starters, entrees, sides and deserts I would have to recommended trying them all.   Definitely look over the specials board above the host station as seasonal specials change on a regular basis.\\n\\nBecause of its single location and popularity the only glaring dislike is the wait to get seated.  If you're impatient and temperamental you might find it challenging.  There have been three times where I've been bumped off of the waiting list.

We were in awe of how yummy it looked.  Unknowingly at the time that was OUR food, it was delivered to the wrong table/ticket placer. The lady and her husband cut into it and started tasting it. Then she took it to the counter and told the staff they were delivered the wrong food. Meanwhile my guy was at the counter checking the status of our food, they told him it's coming out in a few. A few seconds later we were delivered the same trays which were just returned by the other couple. The couple and myself started to explain to the gentlemen who delivered the plates what happened and he nonchalantly went back to the kitchen without acknowledging he understood.  I followed him to the counter to check the ETA of the remake and I hear everyone discussing that the food was cold, which was far from the problem because we had because we hadn't tasted the RE-DELIVERED food yet.  I see The line manager touch the food with the back of her glove and tell the chef something inaudible, at the same time I was trying to get her attention to tell her that \\"cold food\\" was not the issue.  She barely listens to my concern when I can see the chefs in the kitchen window deconstructing items from the returned/ now shared plate, such as placing bacon from the plate on the grill and attempting to re-warm other items.  At this point I ask again, were they planning to remake the food and the staff member visibly annoyed snaps and says, \\"I'm having them remake it!\\" I go, I don't think that's what they're doing because I see them trying to reheat some of the same items.  Because of her attitude and lack of customer service I asked for my money back and said we won't be eating here today. She ignored me speaking, never apologized and gave me money back. When I stated it wasn't enough she said \\"you had mimosas\\". We paid $40 total for 2 breakfast plates, 1 mimosa, tipped left over change (about $4 bucks) for bad service and hopes of good food. \\nI worked in the food industry for several years, you are not to re-plate items or give someone food that was returned to you. That is not spec.  I'm glad I drank the mimosa first, because I was amazingly calm through the whole ordeal.

Maybe I set my expectation way too high\\n\\nGimme S'More Shake: 4/5 A bit on the sweet side but if you are a big fan of marshmallow definitely get this one\\n\\nGrapefruit Smash: 4/5 I wish it could be a bit sweeter but it's not bad\\n\\nBlack and Brie Burger: 4/5 Very interesting burger with blackberry inside and the meat was very very juicy and tender\\n\\nWhat's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich: 5/5 This is my favorite. The sandwich bun was actually made of rice. it's definitely special and authentic. I would get jalapeno on the side next time though as it gets a bit too much and sets my mouth on fire~\\n\\nStaff: 6/5 Excellent Excellent Staff~ Gives very good recommendation and very knowledgeable from all the dishes we have questions on to the choice of how the burger should be cooked. We actually had a paper wrapper inside the burger we ordered. When we let him know he immediately apologized and took it off our check and keep asking us if there's anything else we would like. The manager came right to our table to apologize in less than 5 minutes and made sure that we were happy with everything else. I can totally see why this restaurant is so successful and filled with happy customers because of their delicious food and amazing staff. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone I know and would definitely come back here again!!"},{"name":"Revival","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"What has happened at Revival?

I also did not like the jalapeno cheese bomber stuffed with pulled pork ....it was just disgusting cannot even break it down on how it displeases me. The tea was so disgusting and tasteless I had to order an additional drink of Sprite to get some flavor in my life. Not to mention  parking ... Oh dear God parking was horrible. On top of that they offer additional parking off the side of Moreland Avenue . They really need to work something better out eith that.

He asked what else I would like to add & I said whatever other side may be good. He placed the order saying he would ask the chef. I guess inspiration was low because my plate arrived with just those three items (eggs scrambled, not what I wanted) and nothing else. The bowl of grits was huge, but gritty, the bacon was soggy & the eggs were fine. My friend got the green eggs & ham, which I ate some of while my food was being recooked, which was fine at best (aside from the brioche toast it was on, which was the highlight of the meal).

The restaurant was a bit crowded, so we asked if there was enough seating for us, to which the staff said there was one table that could accommodate us. We sat around and it did not seem cramped at first, but when everyone's food came out, there were significant space constraints, to the point that we stacked multiple baskets and set up the condiments on the bench we sat on! Basically, if you are in a larger group, ask to be seated at multiple tables.\\n\\nEverything got better from there though. The complimentary chips and salsa (refills of which are also complimentary!) were fresh, warm, and crunchy to the taste. In retrospect I should have ordered a side of guac at this point, but the chips and salsa themselves were amazing as a standalone.\\n\\nOnto the entr√©es: I order the chicken fajitas with rice and beans, a signature dish of the restaurant, and it yet again did not fail to disappoint. The chicken was flavorful, and the accompanying tortillas were warm and soft - I will definitely be ordering this again. For any fajita dish, be mindful that the plates are very large, so they will take up sizable real estate on the table.\\n\\nThe restaurant is also known for its beef dishes, but as I do not eat beef, I relied on my coworkers to give me their steak in the matter (sorry, I had to). According to them, the beef fajitas were \\"well seasoned\\" and \\"cooked perfectly\\". With regards to authenticity, however, one of my coworkers (a Texas native) said that \\"the food was definitely not authentic Tex-Mex or Caj√∫n\\". I am not one to turn away good Mexican food for the sake of authenticity, but I understand that it is a valid concern for many restaurant-goers (and Yelpers!). For more authenticity, I would suggest El Jefe's or Felipe's, both of which are also located in Harvard Square.\\n\\nOverall, I will definitely be back at Border again.

He bragged about the great barbecue, and as a Southerner  (from Mississippi), I was immediately excited.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, a good band was playing, and there was a lively vibe in the place. My fiance and I danced a bit while we waited in line to place our to-go order. My excitement quickly vanished once we got to the register due to the horrible customer service we received. We ordered a 1/2 slab, 1 bag of peanuts, an order of mac & cheese,  and a Coke. My fiance paid for our food with a BB&T card. As he was signing the receipt, he asked the cashier if he could add the tip on his card, and and the young woman replied that he couldn't do so, that tips could only be given in cash. He then put his card back in his wallet, and asked the woman if she could change a $20. The woman became seemingly irritated even though my fiance was attempting to tip HER. He instructed her to give him back $15 and to put the  $5 in the tip jar.\\n\\nThen the same woman proceeded to give my fiance a Wells Fargo card, which was clearly not his since he'd just paid with a BB&T card. When my fiance alerted the woman that she had handed him the wrong card, instead of thanking him, she became irritated--deep sigh and unpleasant facial expression--and turned away to talk to her female co-worker who was now also at the register.

By no means am I a BBQ expert, but when you do the research and the general consensus of BBQ experts agree on Franklin's much lauded brisket then it probably is true that it is the best if not one of the best briskets around.

During warm weather bring an umbrella and extra beer\\n- From asking around, sounds like ~7am is the time if you want to be first or nearly first\\n- Mingle and share a drink with your neighbors in line, it'll be a better and seemingly shorter wait\\n- https://twitter.com/franklinbbqline will give you photo updates of the line, sometimes you might get lucky"},{"name":"Flat Patties","address":"33 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Flat Patties is great.

With a new James Beard nomination for Best New Restaurant, I had loose expectations. This is a semi-sultry, hip kind of restaurant for Cambridge. Very much something you might expect to see in San Francisco.\\n\\nFor a 9pm dinner reservation, we arrived 10 minutes early and were seated right away. I had no experience with the restaurant aside from the rumors of the absolute best burger in the Boston area (sold out hours before we arrived). \\n\\nWe were seated at our table on the opposite side of the building far past the bar. Walking to the space below ground, the entrance is deceiving because after passing the hostess station, the space opens up and goes on and on. For such an incredible space, dinner here felt very intimate with a casual atmosphere that isn't overly buttoned up. There's somehow this real sense of camaraderie about the restaurant, a certain air about the meal and the space, that a conversation is to be had. It's a private, communal dining experience. They want you to taste bits here and there, and after a bite say, \\"Ohhh...what isssss that???\\" The dishes are not overworked but have an obvious complexity to them. Each dish has that little something special and is different enough that it keeps you guessing. That was the case with most of these dishes, but in my experience, there's some problems.\\n\\n\\nNoteworthy Moments//\\n\\nService- Very Good.  Portion recommendations were on point. Waiter was a bit odd but attentive, water was filled regularly, plates were brought out with \\nexcellent timing. \\n\\n\\nMemorable Moments of the Meal//\\n\\nUtensils - Knife\\nThis knife needs to go away or another needs to be provided for dishes that require cutting. This goes beyond the pork belly and back to the sausage. This knife isn't good for anything beyond butter. The sausage was as soft as can be, and yet the tiny teeth of the knife could barely cut through that and smashed it to pieces before I could break it apart. Seeing as how you're encouraged to share the small plates, cutting up each dish to share could be considered a necessity here. Obviously I want to do more with my knife than push food onto my fork...\\n\\nSeared Contechino Sausage - $13 \\nBeluga Lentils, Honey Roasted Carrots & Apples, Sunchoke.\\nExcellent and what almost pushed me to a 4th star review. There were so many interesting things going on in this dish. The spices in the sausage are what prompted that, \\"Ohhh...what wasssss that???\\" comment more than any of the others dishes of the night.\\n\\nThis could have been a mushy mess but was texturally on point. The parsnips had a little bite to them, the carrots were soft, the sausage was spongy and light, and the lentils were hearty. The sunchoke puree was velvety and the apples were sweet and acidic and brought everything together.  I can't pinpoint the spices used, but detected some five spice... The flavors are delicate, not bold and in your face. I think this is the perfect dish to represent why the restaurant gained it's nomination. \\n\\nCorn Cakes - $?\\nDon't have the details of this but it was lovely. Corn cakes, peppers, maple syrup, popcorn, sweet, savory. \\n\\nCrispy Berkshire Pork Belly - $15\\nAnson Mills Grits, Roasted Apples.\\nThis was a MAJOR, major letdown and the reason I took away the 4th star from my review. In fact I almost took away 2. I've read other reviews that tell me something inconsistent is happening with this one. The dish came out was beautiful, with a thick square of pork belly on the plate. The pork belly (eaten with the grits and apples) was only ok and lacked some personality. Lackluster. And a bite of the pork belly alone was incredibly boring, under seasoned. To top it all off, I could. not. cut. through. the. pork. belly. at. all. Was it the utensils? No, but it's mostly fat. How hard should it be? The skin was crispy but SO TOUGH to cut through. As was the rest of it. I tried cutting it with the grain, against the grain, right side up, upside down, on it's side. This sounds like something for after dinner, not during! It was true acrobatics to try to eat this thing. I would never expect this from a restaurant at this level. What the hell happened here???\\n\\nThis dish almost ruined the entire meal and was exhausting. I had to resort to holding the knife as if I was stabbing someone, hard, down on the plate to try to crack the skin. Even then, it took a lot of prying to cut the rest down to share. It was such a process and is probably now the most ridiculous dining experience I have in memory. Unbelievable.\\n\\n\\nI'll return at another time of day and experience more of the menu to update my review. The prices are very reasonable but the slips ups have me wondering what will happen on my next trip back. I think there's good things happening here. Some of it happened on this night, and some didn't. But we're still talking about it."},{"name":"The Arlington Restaurant & Diner","address":"134 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"Solid breakfast option.\\n\\nSometimes, you just don't want to wait in line to wade through expensive brunch menus.

Plus they still have the old-school dim sum carts (not ordering at the table) which is awesome!  Instant gratification + ability to check out new dishes before buying.  Finally it's very cheap - I never end up paying more than $10-12 per person here for more dim sum than I can eat.\\n\\nHar Gow are a good measure of dim sum since it's basically shrimp + dumpling skin- if the shrimp aren't crisp or are overly seasoned, there's nowhere to hide it.  The har gow here are good - nice flavor, large in size and the shrimp are fresh.\\n\\nIn addition to the regular dim sum (like har gow or sew mai) Hei La Moon has some more authentic dishes like dow foo fah (sweet tofu dish) and ja leung (Chinese donut wrapped in a rice noodle).  These are Cantonese favorites and usually pretty hard to find.\\n\\nThis restaurant can get mobbed so the best bet is to go on Saturday mornings (versus the more popular Sunday mornings).  If the upstairs seems mobbed try heading downstairs to the basement and ask to be seated by the hostess there.  I've never had to wait more than a few minutes.  I think they also take reservations.  \\n\\nThere is also validated parking in the attached parking garage - it's a little confusing.  You pay the parking garage the full amount (something like $6-10?) and then take your parking pass to Hei La Moon, where you pay THEM another $3.  You then take your stamped parking ticket back to the parking garage and they refund your original payment.

Also downtown Austin is Stubbs although I'm not a fan in that over the years they've become less about the food and more about the venue.\\n\\nFor consistently good and reasonably priced BBQ head over to Rudy's on loop 360. That's some of the best Texas BBQ in town. Avoid The Salt Lick. Decades ago before the son inherited it and turned it into the Disney Land of BBQ places. It used to be good but that was a very long time ago and now it's just expensive mass produced tourist fodder.\\n\\nI've also had the opportunity to travel several times with the Texas Monthly BBQ editor around the state visiting several BBQ joints.

The best part for me is the plethora of flavors for a plain old bean and cheese burrito (of course the smothered part adds to that, and it's a plus for sure!!).

I've also tried the Chipotle Poblano quesadilla, which my boyfriend and I found had a few too many pablano chilis, as they were falling out everywhere anyway. The chips and guacamole are very good, but if you order the chips and salsa, know that their \\"salsa\\" is actually pico de gallo (i'm not a fan). If you want actual salsa, ask for their side salsas, which are pretty darn good. Their Tortilla Soup (vegetarian, yay!) is hit or miss for me. I've had it savory, with an excellent variety of tastes (a hit), and I've had it way too sweet, which overpowered any other flavor that might be lurking in the depths (a very depressing miss). Oh, and go to Happy Hour for all their great specials (all day Monday and 3:30 PM to 6:00 PM all other days). They usually throw in a few extra specials, because they're nice that way. :)\\n\\nOn a side note, if you're vegetarian, like me, DON'T order the refried beans. They are cooked with some kind of meat (or lard?), and are far inferior to the black beans anyway (IMO).\\n\\nI will be back many times, or until my boyfriend moves from of Louisville.

I even offered a picture of my passport and still...a harsh rejection with illogical reasoning. I rarely write negative reviews..in fact, I only write raving reviews. But this case struck home. I felt completely disregarded as a customer, a feeling I can only compare to that of being denied access to the deep end of a pool or to ride an exclusive roller coaster attraction when I'm well over the height limit or  even more so to enter a house I've lived in my whole life.

I had to get up and look for napkins. The menus were covered in dirty fingerprints and were coming apart at the corners. My ribs were good. I always get them and they have always been pretty consistent. But, it doesn't feel like the same place anymore. If this place was cleaner, I would give it three stars. The service is one thing that's remained unchanged over the years. I really appreciate how polite people are that work here. But serving people food on dirty tables is not okay.

Yes, Texas is generally not cold, but for those few months that it is after dark, it's pretty unpleasant if you weren't expecting to wait like a teenager outside a concert to see their favorite singer leaving after a show. \\n\\nAnother thing that was a bit irksome: when our party of three finally made it up to the register to place our order, there was an open 4-top table. There were also a few seats that were open at the community table, though they were spread out. The staff at the restaurant are very practiced at gauging when people are leaving and who will fit where. You have to go where they tell you. It doesn't actually bother me that they were saving the 4-top for more people. What bothers me is that after all that time, we were told to hold on while the woman at the cash register proceeded to ignore us, looking down, chatting with the waiters, etc. while we stood. There weren't any apologies about this. We were just left metaphorically *in the cold* while now at the front of the line as they waited for people to leave since they didn't want to put us at the other table. This was definitely poor customer service and should have been dealt with differently. \\n\\nNow, on to the good (the food). My ramen was totally worth the wait. The vegan broth was very flavorful; the wood-ear mushrooms in particular were beyond amazing. I'd actually never heard of that variety of mushroom, and they blew me away. The fried tofu was great, the corn, the greens, all of it. The only thing that I would have added is some spice. Now, if I go back, I know that I'll want to increase the spice factor, but I wanted to start with the plain veggie ramen my first time. \\n\\nI ordered the cocopioca, and when it came time to flag someone down to bring the dessert (indicated by a paperclip on our number), it wasn't easy. The dessert itself was pretty good, though I was hoping for strawberries that were less syrupy from the description. Once I mixed everything up thoroughly and spread the strawberries out more, it was good. \\n\\nAlso, worth mentioning is that the place itself is adorable and comfortable. We ended up at the end of the community table, and it was still pretty spacious. I think this place really needs to expand to meet its demand. Even though I loved my ramen and was glad I went, I'm not sure how often I'd subject myself to such an ordeal for such tastiness. A solid 3 1/2 stars if that were an option, with points lost mostly for annoyance and customer service."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Fun atmosphere, good food, interesting specials."},{"name":"Cured","address":"1825 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4.5","text":"My new favorite place in the universe.

The reason being, is I've dined in various Indian restaurants in the lower mainland to search for the \\"perfect butter chicken\\", hell, even made homemade Butter Chicken just doesnt' cut it, and I love this one. For a while I was so addicted I had it once a week.  It is very very rich, and very tomato-ey. I recommend asking for med-hot spice if you are a spice lover, as I love a burning tongue to a point, but, hot is actually really hot, and mild is pointless.\\n\\nI get takeout 99% more than I do dine-in, but dining in is fine. It gets really busy sometimes, and sometimes is doesn't, but I find the service is a bit slow dining in either way because they usually only have one person waiting on tables.  The food gets out fine though, and I've never had a problem where the food was bad, or good. For a while there,  the chicken in the curries didn't taste fresh, but lately I haven't had a problem and it's possibly they've changed that due to perhaps someone pointing it out.\\n\\nIf I would change anything, it would be that the Naan be bigger. I've been to other places where the Naan is huge, and I love it, but the Naan is pretty small. Not to say it's not excellent, so that just means I have to order 3 at a time sometimes...just for myself! \\n\\nRegardless, I do recommend it. The Tika Misala is a little oily, but always tasty, the veggie pakoras are killer. \\n\\nIf you were to eat here, I recommend dinner service.

My friend ordered the chicken & waffles which I instantly regretted not getting myself (but asked him to order a second piece of fried chicken with his which I added to my pancakes, therefore getting the best of both worlds); it was most likely the best fried chicken I've ever had if you're comparing it to more of a chicken tender than a juicy piece of KFC (which in this case for brunch, a chicken tender is ideal), had a hint of spicy, and the waffle was made of sweet potato - significantly better than just a plain waffle that most restaurants do. \\n\\nOur other friend let us try her chicken & biscuit sandwich which was good, but I was so full and satisfied with my choices I would recommend those alone.

It is pretty much the connotation that if a Chinese restaurant serves good food, then there will be no decor.  In fact, it will most likely be a hole in the wall.  I guess I shouldn't be complaining about getting more than what I expected.  It is the little surprises in our daily routine that brings joys in our lives.  I had a rare opportunity to try many dishes because I was in a group.  The Za Jiang noodles were pretty good and served in a big bowl that was easy for mixing up the bean sauce and the noodles.  The Dan Dan noodles were not as tasty and I believe the noodles were stuck together a little too much, but that can also be because the bowl was not big enough to mix the sauce well.  After some Dan Dan noodles were removed to free up space, we actually mixed it up and got to taste the spicy peanut sauce with the noodles.  House fried rice was pretty good too.  Basil eggplant was a little too salty for my taste.  There was also a tofu dish and I don't remember which one.  It was pretty good and the sauce was definitely more well balanced than the one in the Basil Eggplant.  I had a mango smoothie and it was just OK.  For dessert, we had Fresh Strawberries on Shaved Ice and Red Bean Ice topped with Green Tea Ice Cream.  Both desserts were excellent.  I enjoyed the Red Bean Ice with Green Tea more.
