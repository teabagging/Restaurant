We were in the area and it was one of the first restaurants on the list when I opened up the yelp app. From looks alone, this place looks pretty good.\\n\\nLet's start with the host/hostess greeting. There was none. There was absolutely no one at the front seating guests. We seriously waited for about 2 minutes before anyone approached us. There was a bartender directly in front us, said nothing to us. A couple of waitresses walked by us and said nothing. Not even a hello or someone will be right with you. Nothing. It's not like they were busy either. When we arrived, there were 5 tables and the biggest one was a table of 3. \\n\\nWe were finally seated and our waiter took his sweet time to get to us. Once he did, we could not hear him. His speech was so low and mumbled. We kept having to ask him to repeat himself. My boyfriend decided to get a beer, a Dos X, and they waiter sort of kept pushing him to order something from draft. Dude, we get it. The restaurant carries a wide selection of local brews, but that doesn't mean you have to shove them down our throats. I ordered the Prickly Pear Margarita. It was just ok. Not a lot of alcohol; hardly any actually. I've definitely had better margaritas.\\n\\nFor starters, we stuck with the free chips and salsa. They brought out two kinds of salsa: mild and spicy. Neither one was spicy. They had good flavor, but no heat at all. For the person that said this taste like authentic Mexican salsa, I'd like to know where in Mexico they tried said salsa. Don't get me wrong, the salsas were good, but they are NOT anywhere near what an \\"authentic\\" Mexican salsa is. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Loaded Burrito. It was pretty meh. No distinct flavor of anything. The carnitas were somehow cooked with bacon, which made the carnitas taste quite a bit more greasy than needed. I ordered the Beef Barbacoa Tacos. First I want say, how in the world do you have 6 variations of tacos and you can not \\"mix and match\\". First Mexican restaurant I've ever gone to that has told me that.  The tacos, again, were pretty meh. No distinct flavor of anything. It has a habanero aioli drizzled on top that has absolutely zero heat. It was actually a pretty sweet sauce. For sides, the tacos came with beans and rice. I got the black beans, which were pretty good. However, the rice was straight up Uncle Ben's Garden Vegetable microwaveable rice with butter. I've had Uncle Ben's several times in my lifetime not necessarily by choice either, and this rice straight up tasted just like it. I did not care for the rice. Or for most of our meal. \\n\\nWe decided to give dessert a shot and went with the churros. Now, I noticed the picture of the churros someone posted on yelp had three different sauces. However, the menu says it comes with chocolate sauce and that's what it came with. The churros, oh the churros. They were freshly made, yes. However, they were not fried properly. The outside was way too dark and the inside was still raw as in it had some liquidy batter; obviously someone has the oil too hot. On top of that, they weren't properly covered with the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Chocolate sauce was good.\\n\\nThroughout the entire meal our waiter was pretty much nowhere to be seen. And when he did come back we couldn't hear him and it would years before he came back. At the end of our meal he came by and asked if we wanted a box for any of the leftovers to which we said yes; we didn't want to throw away food. Came back about 5 minutes later with the box, no check. Hmm, I would've thought you'd bring me my check when I asked for the to-go box. He started to take the orders of the table directly next to us as they had just been seated. Not one did he glance our way or asked us anything on his way back and forth to that table.

I called ahead the morning before and reserved a table for 2. Here's my thorough review:\\n\\nCocktails\\n\\nI had two cocktails. I started the meal with a basil infused one that tasted like an herb infused lemonade. At the end of the meal I had the classic \\"Bistro du Midi\\" cocktail, with gin and champagne. Both masterfully made by the sadly departing bartender Eric. Great stuff!\\n\\nWine\\n\\nThe wine list has changed in the past year to be sectioned out more based on the grape varietal instead of the region. This makes it more accessible to American wine drinkers. I drink French wine regularly so I already had a sense of what I wanted. The meal was mostly seafood based, so I chatted with the sommelier Todd for a moment to narrow it down. He was very helpful and knowledgeable and described the wine in very accessible terms. I settled on a bottle of Vin de Pays du Val de Loire (country wine of Loire Valley) by Domaine Fournier, made with Sav Blanc. It paired amazingly.\\n\\nDinner\\n\\nThe meal starts out with fresh baked bread, grissini breadsticks, and olive oil. I was doing my own thing for dinner, got 2 premier plates (appetizers basically) for my meal. One was the special of pigs cheek, which is amazing. Think boar meat, dark beef, or any other kind of hearty meat. The other was the octopus, which had just the right amount of herbs and zest. My gf got the bouillabaisse, which had amazing fish, fresh mussels, and a very large shrimp. The wine paired perfectly with all of it. Portion sizes are smaller then most other restaurants, it's done intentionally with the anticipation that you'll be having a 4 course meal. I prefer it that way.\\n\\nDesert\\n\\nI called ahead and mentioned that I'd be getting a Grand Marnier souffle. It takes about 20 mins to cook, so either expect the wait, or indicate well ahead of time to the wait staff that you want one. This is one of the few places in Boston you can even get a fresh souffle, let alone one of this quality. It was amazing! My gf wanted to get the chocolate, which is also great, but I insisted on the orange zest of Grand Marnier, and we were both very glad for it. It paired well with the meal, given the citrus.\\n\\nService\\n\\nI've never been serviced so well in my entire life! Staff was curteous, attentive, professional, and fun. I was greeted by the hostess (Jeanne), seated by one of the managers(John), served some great cocktails (Eric), had a chat with the sommelier(Todd), my waitress (Amy) was very attentive, the table was promptly cleared and decrumbed (Dan / Caroline). You will literally never find such great service any where else in the city. I know, I look for it every weekend.\\n\\nAmbiance\\n\\nThe restaurant is immaculate and beautifully decorated. The upstairs is wide open, but has a few tables that are tucked way for a more private experience, and also offers a few banquet tables as well for larger groups. The white linen table clothes, Riedel glassware, white porcelain flatware, flowers on the window sills, and wooden tables give you a very modern feel with a slight rustic touch. Overall modern, upscale, with a hint of European Old World.\\n\\nOverall\\n\\nI've been to various top-end Italian restaurants, and a few French restaurants around Boston, and this is the BEST! What you get here is the best French-styled seafood and other dishes in the city, top level service, amazing wine, deserts, cocktails, etc. for a reasonable price. It does cost more, but you're buying quality, and it's a very fair trade off. This is the perfect place to have a celebration meal, date night, or to explore and find unique, high quality, and flavorfully complex food.

They were made just the way I like them. Smashed and deep fried with no salt. It was like having a piece of plantain bread. I could have easily eaten a couple more of them. They would have gone great with some kind of tropical relish. Yum! Next I tried the rice with the pigeon peas. All by itself it had a great flavor and the peas were cooked just right. But as soon as I mixed it with the sauce from the Oxtails, OMG it was a match made in heaven. The Oxtails were a bit undercooked but OMG was that flavor SPOT ON! Had they been cooked a bit longer and there been a few more on the plate, that would have been one of the best dishes of Oxtails I have tried. Even thought they were a bit underdone, I cleaned that plate! \\n\\nWhile I was still eating, my friend Jerry happened to show up.

It couldn't be any different from how I would imagine it. Originally my friend and I was just going to get it and leave. However, we saw that they also sold salt and pepper chicken. We hadn't had it in a while so we decided to order it. Due to the nature of the chicken, we ended up with our drink coming out a lot quicker than the chicken. It was during that 5 minute where my friend and I decided to spend the afternoon here. The ambience of the store is so inviting, it felt so warm and comfortable. When the chicken arrived, we literally finished it in a minute because it was so good, we couldn't stop stuffing our face with it. We ended up getting two more orders afterwards.\\n\\nThe tea is nothing to laugh at either. You could tell that although this is a new store, the quality of the bubble tea is up to standard with the rest of the Vivi's bubble tea chain. We order two drinks, the Peach ice jelly tea and 3Q milk tea. Both were excellent and completely harmonizes with the sat and pepper chicken. The perfect afternoon snack combination. \\n\\nAll in all, we ended up staying for almost an hour from what seem like an innocent bubble tea pick up.

The restaurant cannot handle this volume.  Be prepared to wait over an hour for your tofu scramble or pancakes. \\n\\nWe were not prepared for today's Saturday lunchtime wait, but after reading some of the reviews on here and the manager Susan D.'s replies, it sounds typical to wait 45-60 minutes for food to come out on Saturdays and Sundays.  Needless to say we were not aware of this, and after placing our lunch orders we waited over an hour and our food never arrived.  After a full hour, we noticed another table who arrived after us received their orders.  In another 5 minutes or so after that, we decided to just leave.  Such a disappointment. Our order had to have been up soon (as promised by our waitress - who was very apologetic about the kitchen backup as she offered to refill our complimentary bowl of chips a second time, which we declined). I appreciate the staff acknowledgement at this point, but after a full hour and five minutes we didn't want wait even another 20 more minutes, especially not knowing if that was all there was left, or something even more ridiculous.\\n\\nI feel that after ordering, 30 minutes is a reasonable wait in a casual restaurant if you haven't been forewarned about a delay.  And the earlier on the better. It would help adjust expectations if the front greeter would explain that being seated at a table is really a waiting period where you can order drinks.  It's the same as waiting in line outside of a restaurant, except you aren't aware of what's happening because they have already taken your food order.  That is, unless you happened to read the sign on their door about the small kitchen, that apparently I missed. If there had been a long line outside, we would have been aware of the capacity problem and chosen another lunch spot - seating people without explanation just hides the issue.  \\n\\nThe other table being served ahead of us was probably just a mix-up (or maybe our orders really were up soon like our waitress promised), but at that point we had enough waiting and were cranky from our hunger-induced headaches.  I am not sure we'll be back...but,  the weekday menu is SOOO delicious! Especially lentil loaf, pacman salad,  kelp pad thai, to name a few we had recently, and all the homemade desserts, mmm.

In big spaces like these Olympic Village dining halls, you want to be near at least some people. Otherwise they forget you are there.  Not tons of people in the building, but still took an unreasonably long time for all the steps.  Bartender distributes soft drinks as well as liquor, so you're in line behind people ordering Caesar's and pints, thus drinks are slow to come. We both ordered the burger/fries. When they did come, they were hot, but the only outstanding thing about them was that they had been charred to black on the edges, which was the main flavour. Supremely under seasoned and the secret sauce is blah.  Came with cheese, lettuce (the middle chunky yellow part, not the green leaves) and tomato. Needs onion or a spicy mustard to cut through the bland.  Also - they charge extra for each pop refill, but don't mention that. In fact our server offered to get me a refill, I didn't ask.

The chicken sandwich was good but nothing super memorable but the cheese grits were outstanding!! My hubby ordered a mixed grill that came with shrimp, chicken and tenderloin.  It was wonderful! The sauces and the way they cooked the meats just made it perfect.  It came with mashed potatoes which soaked up the yummy sauces and really completed the dish.  Our son ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were ok but the chicken was to die for! It was so well fried and cooked, I don't know if I've ever had better fried chicken breast.

I've come to hate Wings Over becuase I can't count on them for service. I can only count on the fact that they'll fuck something up, and then give me the runaround. Something is missing with 7/10 orders. Something is wrong with 1/10 orders. Meaning only 2/10 orders are even close to being right. I've gotten 1 fry instead of 2, 1 fry instead of onion rings. No sides. No dipping sauces, no extra wing sauce that I paid for. In an order for 2 people, 1 box of wings was missing.  Straw that broke my back was when they forgot an entire order of wings, I called back in and asked them to re-deliver it. But you were too busy, and wouldn't have another driver for over an hour. So I asked for a refund, except I paid cash so.....I would have to go down there to pick up my cash, just because you guys screwed up for the umpteenth time? I genuinely do not understand how this location is still in business, unless it's being carried by the others.\\n\\nWhere I used to work, we'd do large orders, 10+ people. And there was a meal missing EVERY SINGLE TIME. I don't exaggerate. I was a server in college, I knew how to expedite correctly. It's not that difficult, and in fact, the larger orders were always the most correct, because we'd check them most carefully. So, one time, we called ahead, let them know we'd be putting in a large order, did it all online. And there was STILL an order missing. So we called in, and she knew our caller ID, picked up the phone, almost shouting, \\"I checked it myself, there is nothing missing.\\" I apologized (why? because she was a bitch), but told her we were missing an order of 6 wings. So what did Wings Over Somerville do? Improve their service? Fuck no.

I understand that you shouldn't go to a brewery expecting the food to be out of this world...but the quality of this place is exceptionally horrible. 3 tacos were served in rock hard shells, the actual pieces of fish were tiny and dry and were covered in a greasy layer of batter. The tacos had stale and dry pieces of shredded carrots on the bottom...such a strange combination. Not once did our server check up on us to see if we needed anything. I saw her aimlessly wandering around and avoiding eye contact with customers a few times. \\n\\nWe eventually had to ask another server for our bill. She was prompt and apologetic.

I figured if I could not find any good entr√©es - I'd at least be able to get an appetizer/soup/salad and a drink!  As soon as we walked out back I was hooked.  As others have said, the view is gorgeous and peaceful.  There was a live band playing and a good energy about the place.  I felt like I was on vacation in some resort town - the whole experience was very relaxing.  The dishes we ordered were really good - great roasted hen, spinach horseradish mashed potatoes, tomato/basil/mozzarella salad and probably the best tasting chocolate desert I have ever had \\"miles of chocolate\\" it was called.  As others have said, the service was a bit slow but all were very welcoming.  I guess my only other wish was that maybe there was still a tiny bit more variety on the menu - it was hard for me to find something to eat or maybe I was also trying to keep the bill down - many of the options are a bit pricey.

But for the sake of full disclosure, I did go during Hurricane Irene weekend, so it was not as busy as it could have been.\\n\\nI called ahead earlier that Saturday and asked the hostess if there were any available reservations for two; there were not, but she told me if we walked in around 7pm, it could be anywhere from a 0 to 45 minute wait. We took the risk and when we got there, we were seated almost immediately. So the night started out swimmingly and only got better from there.\\n\\nThe decor was excellent (it was a modern take on a nautical theme). There was ample space between tables, and the seating was comfortable. With big windows, we could watch the rain outside or the Sox game on two TVs behind the bar.\\n\\nThe menus were simple folded pieces of paper, which was a bit dissonant until I turned mine over to see an expiry date on the back. They must change the raw bar selection so often that it was more economical to have disposable menus, which is a nice touch.\\n\\nNow, my friend and I aren't raw bar connoisseurs by any means (I typically eat what's available in New York City, so you can imagine how overwhelmed we were by the selection of oysters Island Creek had). Our waiter (Milovoj, according to the receipt) was very helpful in recommending a mixed dozen of three different varieties (Island Creek, Chatham, and Welfleet). My friend and I both agreed that the Chatham oysters were the best; they had a unique flavor that really stood out. But all three types were full of natural flavor and meshed well with the sauces. Definitely a class above the Long Island oysters I'm used to!\\n\\nFor our main course, we both had the lobster roll, based on a friend's recommendation. The toasty bread was overflowing with very fresh lobster, which was not overseasoned. The cole slaw and kettle chips also made great sides. I was definitely full after that and two beers.\\n\\nSpeaking of, the beer selection was also excellent, with many imports and domestics that I'd never heard of before. Luckily, the separate drink menu had wonderful descriptions of each one. I highly recommend the Saison Dupont Belgian Farmhouse Ale.\\n\\nAgain, I would like to call out the service at Island Creek. Our water glasses were never empty, our drinks/food arrived promptly, and everyone was very good humored and appreciated our dumb jokes.

I haven't been in Austin in two years and decided to try a new south austin restaurant. This place seemed okay, went in ordered a vegetarian dish since anything with meat tended to be a bit more and I prefer veggies anyhow. What I received was a sea food dish. I immediately brought this to my server, Taylors, attention. She said I had ordered the other thing, I told her I said the vegetarian, whatever it was (I had pointed to it and said the vegetarian this) and then she said the name of it. First she told me that I ordered the other thing, and when I told her no, I ordered the vegetarian of that dish, she told me she must have not heard me, but was somewhat short about it. Whatever, she asked if I wanted it remade. The place was going to close in 20 minutes and I didn't really feel like waiting since I had other things to get to, and plus I hate when people throw out food, so I felt I'd just try to eat what they served me and save everyone some trouble. \\n\\nWell as it would turn out the dish was very salty, which I wasn't expecting from a seafood dish, the mussels looked really weird, only one had the normal flesh part, the other two had this black stringy stuff in it? The fish was okay but salty. And the plantains were good. I didn't even bother trying to octopus. So in total I had one bite of mussels, one bite of fish, one bite of rice, and the eat the three plantains first, which were admittedly the only good part. After deciding that I couldn't eat this dish, I informed the waitress when she finally noticed that I had pushed my plate away and wasn't eating, and that's when she brought me the bill. The bill which was 5 dollars more then the dish I had ordered and not gotten. Because this one had fish, and the other was veggie, so I guess it makes since that it costs more. But I didn't order the fish, I didn't even eat 95% of it. I figured it'd be better for them to not throw out an entire plate of food and start from scratch, with time I didn't have, and I figured neither did they. \\n\\nIn any event I told my server that it was more expensive then what I had ordered. She told me I was wrong. I told her  the veggie dish was $12ish. She went and got a menu. It said $12ish for the veggie dish. She said she'd talk to the manager. She came back and said since I took a bite of the meal I'd have to pay for the full price of the meal I ate. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager was very rude and not understanding at all, just told me he could have remade the meal in five minutes so why didn't I just order the other meal, even though the waitress didn't tell me it would only take 5 minutes. He even asked if I had brought this to the servers attention in the first place, which leads me to believe she didn't bring up the mix up until I brought up the increased price, and she had to ask the manager to change the ticket. In any event he ended up going down to the price of the meal to that of which I originally ordered. I paid, left, and will never come back here again."},{"name":"Zaza's Cuban Cafe","address":"1 Jeff Fuqua Blvd, Airside 1, Gates 10-19","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The best coffee I've ever had from a vender.

A few of us licked the plate. The greens themselves were nothing to write home about, but like I say, good sauce.\\n- The alkaline noodles were pretty good, but chalky (maybe the almonds needed better processing?)\\n- Gnudi was okay.\\n- The tofu was not at all appetizing. (Kind of like chalky baby food?)\\n\\nWINE:\\n- The staff does a good job of selling you on the wine (as they should considering most glasses are in the $12 range!). \\"Biodynamic\\" is mentioned quite a bit. Since no one actually defined this term in regards to the wine, what I've come away with is that it means \\"not as good as what my brother-in-law's parents make themselves (for $5/bottle)\\". My suggestion is to reconsider the image of serving \\"biodynamic\\"... and serve some good organic wine (there's a number of great bottles that come from BC). \\n\\nSERVICE:\\n- Our server was as attentive as possible, but was incredibly overworked. We came in on Friday night. The place was full, and there appeared to be only a few people serving. We waited over 15 mins to even order our drinks. \\n\\n- We were asked to split up our own bill, because the computer system is incapable of doing this. (For a relatively new restaurant, particularly one that serves shared plates, this just seems like poor planning). Regardless, the way it was handled was the primary issue. I've been to many restaurants were the computer system is archaic and not able to split bills... but usually the waitress attempts to help. Not here, she just said it wasn't possible and left. A manager (maybe?) came up to us about 10 minutes later with a calculator (after we'd obviously already worked out the splits ourselves). This situation could have been 100 times better if the waitress had of just taken a different approach: \\"No, my apologies, we don't usually split bills, but let's see what I can do...

Unfortunately, when we left the restaurant and opened up the containers, we found out that they messed up our order and gave us 2 chicken gorg.  Still, the stuff was AMAZING.

The setting of the restaurant was so unique and beautiful--it's located in what was formerly a house and garage, that's now been converted into a series of dining rooms. Everything from the plastic table cloths to the metal plates/cups were reminiscent of what might be found on the street-side restaurants in Southeast Asia, and the Christmas lights hung around the restaurant and plastic coverings separating the various dining rooms also contributed to that vibe.\\n\\nWe came early at 5PM on a Friday night and waited for about 20 minutes before getting in. At the table, we were started with spiced, roasted peanuts, which were good, but the spice mixture wasn't all that memorable. To drink, we started with the honey drinking vinegar--these are homemade syrups made in-house and mixed with carbonated water to create unique-tasting sodas. The one I got however, didn't taste all that special, and I probably wouldn't get it again.\\n\\nMy wife and I decided to split a few dishes, and we started with the chicken khao soi, or curry noodle soup. This was a delicious dish, which came with a homemade coconut curry broth, egg noodles, crispy wonton strips, and an entire chicken drumstick and thigh, which were so tender. On the side were pickled veggies, onion, lime, and plenty of dried red chiles for mixing into the broth. While the dish was indeed very tasty, I felt that the spice and flavor levels weren't as strong as they could have been.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered the Neua Naam Tok, which was a flank steak salad, consisting of thin slices of medium rare flank steak mixed with lemongrass, mint, shallots, cilantro, and toasted rice powder, along with a few other ingredients. This dish was probably my favorite of the night, as all of the spices were so complex and seemed to work so well together. It went extremely well with the sticky rice we ordered on the side, which gave the dish a little bit more substance. We also had the Laap Plaa Duuk Yaang Isaan, a catfish salad (which looked somewhat like the steak salad), consisting of smoked catfish mixed with lemongrass, galangal, toasted rice powder, and other herbs. This dish was a lot stronger and pungent, and in my first bite, I got a mouthful of extremely spicy chili. This was served with a plate of bitter herbs and vegetables on the side (called phak sot), including Thai basil, cilantro, a type of raw lettuce, and cucumber, in order to cut down on the spice level. Both of these dishes were delicious and complex (though not particularly mindblowing)--however, they were certainly unlike any other Thai food I've ever had before!\\n\\nOverall, the setting and vibe of this restaurant were extremely memorable, as were some of the dishes. The food here was certainly levels beyond the Americanized Thai food found all over the States, but it certainly takes time and knowledge to appreciate and get accustomed to. This was quite an adventurous experience, and I was really so grateful for the opportunity to experience authentic Thai food at Pok Pok."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It is so unfair that the Eastside has all the fabulous restaurants!

Cool atmosphere. The menu is very dense filled with mostly smaller plates meant for sharing. One side note, the water they serve is very strange and neither my wife nor I liked it at all. We couldn't put our finger on the taste but it was almost a rice/coconut water taste. \\n\\nI digress, we ordered the papaya salad, short ribs and eggplant, along with an order of sticky rice. The food all came out separately. The papaya salad was very good, not as spicy as others I've had but very flavorful. The eggplant was just ok. Too much fish powder for our liking.

I ordered the penne arrabiata ($14.50) and asked for them to add some veggies in since it literally was just pasta and sauce. He told me that my only options were arugula or broccoli... very bizarre for a full-service restaurant to only have two vegetables available. I ended up buying a bunch of spinach on the way home and sauteing it up myself to add to the pasta. They also really mean al dente - enough that my pasta almost had a crunch, which isn't so pleasant. The boy had the lasagna and thought it was pretty good ($16.50). My portion was big enough for two meals but his was a single square that he finished pretty rapidly.

My wife said it this morning regarding Morton's : That was the most expensive lousy meal I think we have ever had. \\n\\nI myself didn't think it was lousy but it wasn't very good and if you are going to spend almost three hundred dollars for a meal for two it should be really good. \\n\\nLet's start with valet service. That was excellent. Ten dollars with tip. We were seated quickly for a Saturday night and the restaurant wasn't too busy, which indicated to me that something might be wrong with this place. Everything here is expensive. We each started out with cocktails. They were well made but not strong enough for my taste. We were served this big bread with a plate of butter. That was excellent. \\n\\nWe shared a Morton's salad which as a signature salad I would expect to be more inspired but it was alright by me but my wife wouldn't eat it. She had them take her half away and she tried the lobster bisque instead. She didn't like that much either. It seemed they \\"stretched\\" the recipe by adding too much cream. \\n\\nShe wanted prime rib which Morton's doesn't serve so she opted for the ribeye instead. I had a mixed grill of filet, shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops. The seafood was good. I was disappointed by the steak. It was tender but not very flavorful. We also shared a baked potato which was perfectly prepared and had all the usual toppings. \\n\\nMorton's has an extensive and expensive wine list. The cheapest Cabernet was $45 which retails for about ten dollars. I know wines very well and that shouldn't even be on a menu at a place like this. But its probably for those who want some wine but are surprised by the prices. We opted for the BV Cabernet which was $75 and from what I saw was the best value on the wine list. It retails for $20 but wine at restaurants is always very expensive. So that doesn't bother me. We didn't have dessert. \\n\\nThe staff is excellent. Even though I was casually dressed we were treated well. \\n\\nYou really have to give diners a good value these days to survive in the restaurant business and with so many options I'm not surprised that Morton's was not the busy restaurant it was twenty years ago. Fifty dollar entr√©es should taste like it.

I'm not sure what it is, but I seem to have been doing a lot of repeat Thai visits to the New West area over the last little while.\\n\\nOn my first revisit to this restaurant, I decided to stick with something from their lunch special menu and ordered the Gaeng Garden ($13) which is a red coconut curry with mixed vegetables and served with a side of rice, salad, and spring roll. I paired it with a Thai Iced Tea ($4.50) which was refreshing and creamy.\\n\\nThe spring roll was crunchy and the salad had a citrusy dressing on it. There were quite a bit of veggies in this dish including bamboo, crinkle-cut carrots, peppers, cabbage, green beans and fragrant basil. You can customize the heat level on most of their dishes (their default spice level is 2-out-of-5). While I asked for a medium spice level (3-out-of-5), I found that it wasn't very spicy and it could have used some more heat.\\n\\nOn my second revisit the following week, I attempted to order the Jungle Curry because that sounded like an interesting dish. What arrived at my table, however, was actually the Pad Kee Mao or Drunken Noodles ($15). \\"Jungle Curry\\"... \\"Drunken Noodles\\"... I guess they could sound similar. As it turned out, this spicy rice noodle dish was a happy mistake. Saut√©ed with chicken, eggs, bell peppers, onions, tomato, chili, mushrooms, and basil, it was very similar to the more familiar pad thai dish.\\n\\nUnlike my last dish, there was a good amount of heat with the toothsome noodles here. It's no wonder why this is one of their popular items.\\n\\nUndeterred from my failed attempt at ordering the Jungle Curry on my last visit, I came back the following week and ordered the Gaeng Pa ($17). This is a non-coconut milk curry with green beans, eggplant, carrots, bamboo shoots, and basil. It doesn't come with rice so I asked for a bowl of Jasmine Rice ($3).\\n\\nThis dish is very saucy but not like the thick, creamy curry that you would get with regular coconut milk curries. There was quite a bit of veggies in this dish but I found that I was missing the thicker sauce that I've become accustomed to over the years.\\n\\nNot wanting my memory of this place to be based solely on the jungle curry, I made a point of revisiting for a fourth time to try their Green Curry Chicken ($16) as this is usually the standard dish that I order at all Thai restaurants. I couldn't remember why I hadn't ordered this on my last three visits but then realized that it's not on their lunch specials and you have to order from their regular menu. As such, it doesn't come with rice (which is a necessity if you order curry) so I wound up ordering a side of Jasmine Rice ($3).\\n\\nThe Gaeng Kiew Wan was prepared with green curry paste and coconut milk with eggplant, peas, bamboo shoots, and bell peppers. The level 3 spice was fairly spicy and the curry turned out fairly well.\\n\\nOverall, there are some good options here such as the drunken noodles and service seemed friendly.

IHOP is IHOP when it comes to food, but the service can be different depending on where you go...especially in Orlando. \\n\\nI've found that since Orlando is tourist driven, (especially in the Kissimmee area) you can get really bad service because restaurants know they'll get business no matter what. The focus is not on repeat business. I'm in Orlando several times a year for conferences I work, conferences my husband works and meeting friends who \\"vacay\\" in Orlando. This location actually gives you great service no matter what. I actually looked for this particular location on my last Orlando stay.\\n\\nAs soon as you walk in (whether busy or not) the manager greets you. He pays great attention to the hostess stand and tables coming available. During one of my husband's conferences that me and the kids decided to use as our \\"schools out\\" vacation it rained a lot. So I dropped the kids off in front and told them to go ahead and get seated while I park. When I walked in the manager immediately knew I was the parent and said \\"your kids are in there on the right, mam.\\" (SIDE NOTE: my kids don't look like me....I look like I'm the nanny). Serious attention to detail! Kudos to the manager (he's a tall, serious-looking bald guy).\\n\\nI don't know how I remember people's faces and not names, but I was seated with a middle-aged server named Daniel or Dave for the 2nd time since last year and he is the best server in the joint. I am really crazy about my eggs...you may have seen from other reviews that I take my eggs over medium...I get all excited when the cook gets it right...I can't stand it when I get an over easy egg after asking for over medium! I explained to \\"Daniel\\" that I need the middle to be creamy...that when my fork or turkey bacon touches the yolk, I want it to stick, not run off...he told me that he'd talk to the cook. My eggs came out perfect. \\"Daniel\\" is personable and he even joked with my kids. \\n\\nAlthough \\"Daniel\\" is the best I have had good service from every server I've encountered at this IHOP...and they tend to get my eggs right.\\n\\nThis IHOP isn't in SIRIs GPS as of this writing.

The Burmese Pork Stew and the shrimp in the clay pot were spectacular, and the host who seated us was super nice and chatty and didn't make us share a table with strangers (we're not a fan of community tables).\\n\\nThe only reason for not giving 5 stars would be that the waitress, who was nice when she did come around, never bothered to come by to see how our meal was and after we said we just needed a quick minute to look at the menu to decide on drinks (it was my partner's first time and the beverage menu is quite extensive), disappeared for at least 5-8 minutes. If you want a tip, you need to take care of your customers - not just take their order and disappear til we flag you down to pay.

Perfectly set up for a nice but casual family meal or catch up with friends, it has a dining room, interior bar area and also a huge garden and patio in the rear which is great for those warm evenings.\\n\\nService wise, the staff were great. We came in here on our way to the airport and they took care of our luggage for us, stowing it away safely. Our server also helped out with drinks suggestions and his favorites from the menu.\\n\\nFood wise, the menu has a great selection. Mains are called \\"platters\\", and that should be a warning. The portions are huge.\\n\\nI had the Catfish for mains with a side of garlic mash. The dish was amazing. The catfish was perfectly cooked and topped with a Cajun gravy which included baby shrimp, which bound all the flavours together, to give you a big rich zesty punch. The garlic mash was extremely tasty with a great creamy texture - I feel like the dish was lacking being served with some greens to round it all off, but you can order these extra as a side.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had the green chilli and chicken Mac and cheese, and while it was tasty, I feel it was slightly misleading as it wasn't the Mac n cheese we expected or know and love. It was served in something reminiscent of an alfredo cheese sauce. While all the flavours worked (special shout out to the corn), it didn't have an overly cheesy taste or gooey texture, or any of the crisp on the top.

I had to order it. i had only found durian in one other place in Atlanta and it was pretty decent, but I hungered for more. I ended up ordering the Durian Dessert Bowl and the Snow White Mango Slush-O. (Pro-tip: make sure you mix up the Slush-O so you get the delicious creaminess throughout the whole drink. One of my friends didn't realize that was a necessary step and it took the drink from a 4 to a 10). \\n\\nThe durian dessert dish did not disappoint. It was creamy, sweet, and fresh! I was loving it. The rest of my group however... not so much. They had only heard of the tales of horror popularized by Buzzfeed and other online sources. A few were brave enough to try some. Only one actually enjoyed it, but not enough to offset the smell. Oh well. More for me!\\n\\nThe whole experience was great.

Yes we get it, they wanted to portray the authenticity of the Thai street food scene and yes it mimicked that but the prices should not mimicked the price of a 4 star restaurant. Fourth parking, parking here is difficult. Lastly, our waiter! Our waiter was so unenthusiastic and appears to be annoyed as soon as we walked in. My wife and I are super easy and not difficult people at all. First we were under the impression that our waiter thinks that we cannot afford to eat here. We often get ID since we appear way younger than our ages so from that start he probably was thinking that we are wasting space in this \\"beautifully well decorated\\" restaurant. Waiting time for our food was actually not bad. I ordered the house special chicken, the only thing special about this chicken is the high price. It was so dry and burnt that the rotisserie chicken in Costco tasted so much better! Thai ice tea is mediocre, the Thai food cart is so much better in taste and customer service. Oh let me get back to the waiter, the waiter did not even checked on us on how we're doing, no water refills none of that. The irony is that waiter keeps on checking the table next to us but doesn't bother to check us, is it because we are Asians? Finally the bill, he literally threw the bill nearly from the other table to our table with a pen to keep the receipt from flying and he told us to pay in front instead of him waiting for it! Such customer service! The only positive that we got from eating at Pok Pok is the music! I love the authentic traditional Thai music but it's not worth coming back to be maltreated again and pay a premium."},{"name":"NY Pizza Baby","address":"1271 Semoran Blvd","city":"Casselberry","stars":"3","text":"Was a place I enjoyed dining at until they charged be extra on a pizza at happy hour because I didn't specifically say \\"I want happy hour pizza\\".

My husband and I decided to try it out this weekend, and while I should offer the caveat that this was their first weekend open I must say I was really disappointed. \\n\\nFirst off, we all know diner food is hang over cure food. That in mind I wanted to sit down and dig in as soon as possible. Tables were all full so we sat at the counter. Tip one: if you are indeed hung over, or maybe just want to enjoy your meal, don't sit at the counter, unless  you're into having things banged and slammed around you as the staff yells and complains to and about one another. As someone who has worked in the industry I can sympathize that things get crazy, but I don't need to hear orders barked at the waitresses in an awful tone while my coffee cup remains empty. I was offended FOR some of the staff- an uncomfortable environment to say the least.\\n\\nSo let's chalk that up to a rush and stress. Fine. Add on the fact that our food took forty minutes once ordered- and although we were warned the kitchen was backed up it's a mystery why an egg sandwich and biscuits and gravy (a make ahead dish I'd assume) would take that long when most of the other tables already had their food. They must've done hardly any prep work. When it did come out my biscuits were dense, although the gravy was tasty and well seasoned, and my husband's egg sandwich was kind of a joke. Toast, one very thing fried egg, and a small sausage link CUT IN HALF.

We usually order the whole duck vs. half so we can have enough for later :) However, I doubt I'd have the Peking Duck here again, they did not do the traditional table side service of slicing and rolling individual pancakes with the scallions etc and the 3rd stage dish made with the meat left over was okay but not on par with its higher price.\\n\\nEarly on, the food used to be hit or miss, especially take out. But they fixed any variances, because it has been consistently very good for a long time now. I don't know how well they do their westernized menu, moo goo gai pan etc; maybe if you go there for that, your experience may be different.

Don't get me wrong--you might get an absolutely excellent drink at any one of the other places I mentioned, but Weather Up turns out consistently excellent drinks all the time. This doesn't mean you are guaranteed to love every drink you try--some may just not be to your liking--but you can bet that it was well-made with quality ingredients, attention, and care. \\n\\nIt is this attention to detail that has led some people to begin bad-mouthing them. I fully believe that people may have waited a long time for their drink, or been discouraged from coming in when the house was already packed. There are only two bartending stations in the place, and the fact that they put their full attention and care into each and every drink means that they don't come out at the pace of the drinks at many other establishments.\\n\\nTo help you enjoy your visit to Weather Up, I'll offer some guidelines: come at an off-hours time, meaning don't show up when the place is hopping on Friday or Saturday late night. You're probably not going to find a table at such times, and your drink is bound to take a long time to arrive. They only have about six tables and eight barstools in the lovely indoor (air-conditioned) area, so if you can't find a seat inside, you'll be sitting outside in their backyard. You won't find me sitting out there until around September or October, probably. If the parking lot is packed, they are bound to be very busy, so you might think of coming back at another time. Good times to go include early in the evening on weeknights, or late afternoon on Saturday or Sunday (and they ARE OPEN on Sunday, despite the hours posted above), around the time they open. \\n\\nDrinks are $10 across the board, they do take credit cards now, and they still do not offer food (and I agree that it would be less confusing if they just removed that page from the menu until they get the food service up and running). \\n\\nOne of the reasons I love Weather Up is that it introduced me to my new favorite drink, the Jungle Bird, a drink made with pineapple (freshly squeezed, as are all their juices), lime, Campari (for a hint of bitterness, very unusual in a tropical drink), and Demerara Rum (for a bit of deep molasses flavor), served on the rocks (or ROCK in the case of Weather Up--it is served in a glass with a single giant ice cube). It's an excellent and surprising drink with a head of dense, creamy foam from the shaken pineapple juice. If molasses/pineapple/Campari sounds interesting to you, you should definitely give it a try!"},{"name":"Mad Mex - Columbus","address":"South Campus Gateway, 1542 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Cheap and delicious.

The lobster bisque was gross- it had good bites of lobster but the red bisque had a smoky flavor I did not like at all.  The scallops were served with pieces of bacon that were so tough, I couldn't chew them, which did not pair well with the soft texture of the oysters.   \\nOur server was great at the beginning- sweet, nice, energetic, and knowledgeable.  But service quickly went down hill - we waited too long for our drinks to come out, and then waited too long between courses and again for the bill.

I ate at Harvest Bistro for breakfast. Upon arrival at the HB \\"check in\\" station, they will ask for your room number and recognize your Hilton status (if applicable). Since I was a Hilton Honors Gold member I was entitled to the Continental Breakfast selection at $10 or the full buffet at $20. I went ahead and opted for the full buffet. The price was definitely worth it. The buffet featured eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes and made to order omelettes. The quality of food was noticeable. Eggs were very fresh and not the powdered standard that buffers use now a days. Food was constantly being replenished by the staff. I have to recognize the staff. They definitely went beyond every time. They were extremely helpful and attentive. Overall, Harvest Bistro is a full buffet that offers a wide variety of fresh breakfast foods. It is well worth the $20 or full price with the expansive selection and friendly service. This should definitely go on your to-do list for breakfast if you are staying on property.

I admit the idea of meatball-themed food did not sound immediately appealing to me. But the Yelp reviewers are right -- it's well worth a visit. I tried the \\"Trio\\" sampling of three meatballs. I picked the sausage and pepper (nice and spicy) the mediterranean (mild lamb and cool tzatziki sauce) and my favorite, the chicken parmesan (nice tangy sauce and cheese). It came with a delicious \\"Stoppe salad\\" of fresh greens and tiny plum tomatoes in an nice vinaigrette, with a little cube of crusty focaccia bread as well. The humble paper plate was beautifully laid out and plenty filling for lunch, but not overwhelming or heavy at all.\\n\\nMeatballs are the idea, but not everything on the menu contains them. My wife had a frittata from the brand-new brunch menu. The outside was crisp and browned; the inside a perfect fluffy omelette with creamy little red potatoes. It was a generous size for a brunch serving as well. We finished up with a mini cannoli and a flaky lemon sfogliatelle from the dessert menu, both of which were terrific.\\n\\nAll of the food had the feel of careful curated home cooking. All the greens were crisp; all the meat lovingly browned and attractively presented. And it all tasted great. I was only sorry we did not get to sample the \\"beds\\" the Stoppe serves with its full-sized dishes, such as the white bean ragu. We will have to try those on our next trip, which will probably be soon.\\n\\nAs others have noted, Isabella the rightfully proud proprietress personally welcomed us and kindly explained menu items as she circulated about the small dining area taking care of everyone. She told us that they will soon be moving into the space next door to expand, which is a fine idea -- the Meatball Stoppe deserves more space for its clever concept and delicious dishes.\\n\\nFive easy stars for a great idea, beautifully executed food, and a clear dedication to making things enjoyable for everyone.

It was super-fast, and still hot after a 10 minute drive.\\n\\nThe cheese portion is very generous, and it was bagged into two portions separately from the chili so as to better survive a to-go commute. They included a package of oyster crackers and several hot sauce packets. I tried the hot sauce on one bite, however I personally do not like hot sauces that have a strong vinegar taste. I would put my own Cholula or something on it, but honestly it did not need any extra kick, it is a slow building heat and I would only have added a bit of Chipolte Cholula if I'd had some just for the extra flavor. The coney dogs (three of them) are a bit on the small side, like the smaller dogs you get in a 10 pack instead of 8 pack. The skin was a little tough on them, something I only started noticing when we noticed our toddler disliking tough-skinned hot dogs, so I can't help noticing this now. The dogs themselves were nothing special, somewhat bland, and hard to cut into bites with only the included plastic fork. They added chunk and went well with the chili, which is where all the flavor comes from anyway.\\n\\nThe chili reminds me of something I had while travelling to Detroit? where my host raved about it having chocolate as an ingredient. It's not chocolate, more of a licorice-like fennel or anise aroma. It's certainly different than Texas / cumin chili, and while the flavor and odor is certainly different, it is good. The chili is super-thin when it is hot. A few minutes after I stirred in the crackers and all the cheese and it cooled down a little, the crackers soaked up some liquid and the cheese helped make it thicker the more it cooled, to the point when it was just \\"warm\\" I could cut it into bites, thus why they serve it with a fork not a spoon? \\n\\nThe prices are not listed on the main franchise website, so I don't know if prices vary too much. My grand total at this location for a Coney Bowl was just over $5, which is reasonable for a good sized portion of no-bean chili and 3 hot dogs with a ton more cheese than I'd normally put on it myself at home.\\n \\nTheir web site has nutritional information.

I came to find out that the original Rudys is based in San Antonio which I hear is even better which is extremely hard to believe considering this was delicious in my eyes!! My colleague ordered a bit of everything so we can try and let me just say this place was packed but plenty of seating to accommodate the larger crowds. It was packed for a Wednesday though! They ask you in line what you want and as you approach the counter to pick up and pay for your order, there is a station for you to grab your cold sides. The sides include anything from pickles to coleslaw to jalape√±o or banana pudding. I had a craving for the sweet but my colleague was treating and I didn't want to look like the fatty even though we ended up ordering quite a bit of food! We got brisket, sausage the chicken for our meats. For sides we got the cream of corn, the baked beans -which I usually hate at BBQ places but this was so awesome! Also we got bread with the order and pickles and definitely have to pile on their BBQ sauce I just wanted buckets of this and I'm not always huge in BBQ. The brisket was juicy and nothing was dry. The sausage was savory and with the right amount of spice. I pilled my brisket with sausage as well as BBQ sauce and pickles and practically died and went to heaven.

After about 20 minutes (and noticing people being taken to tables who arrived well after us), a manager came out to explain that they had accidentally given our table away to ANOTHER party named John (which only had four people, so not sure how they managed to screw that up).\\n\\nAnd a couple of times, they brought a different party's food to our table. And they forgot to bring cutlery to a couple of places. No biggie -- that happens a lot at busy restaurants, and this was immediately following the Pride Parade, so you can expect them to be swamped.\\n\\nWhat I did NOT expect, though, was the totally disgusting lobster and brie grilled cheese sandwich. It tasted like a truckload of salt had been dumped into it, you couldn't taste any lobster (except for a peculiar generic fishy taste -- and not fishy in a good way) or the brie. It tasted like a soggy, salty generic grilled cheese sandwich with lumps of discoloured fish in it.\\n\\nHonestly, I should have sent it back, but was dining with friends and didn't want to slow down their meal.\\n\\nTo cleanse my mouth from that assault, I ordered a virgin pina colada.

Its easy to get lost in the maze of different shelves & store levels here. \\n\\nNow I don't consider myself to be a bookworm but even I had trouble resisting the urge to spend a small fortune on books here! Depending on what you're looking for or how much you're willing to spend, you can make out like a bandit here if the price is right. Some of their books are a little too steep for me, but I prefer going to a bookstore & actually being able to flip through the pages to see if its worth buying than going online & taking a chance that it may not be what I was expecting.\\n\\nIf you come here with friends or family don't expect everyone to finish shopping at the same time! Its very easy to lose track of time when you browse at Powell's & every level has something that may tempt you stay a little bit longer! Whether you're on vacation like I was or if you live in Oregon, Powell's has something for everybody & I cannot recommend any more highly than I already have!"},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went here last night for my first anniversary with my bf.

One of the other guests actually went to grab Devon, who was in the back with a group of people. He came up front and introduced himself. He was really nice and also gave us a quick walkthrough of the space.  \\n\\nWhen we got there, pretty much all of the tables were taken, so we grabbed a small table in back. My boyfriend also decided to buy a coffee, and he paid both our entrance fees with his purchase. The woman who rang him up also brought the coffee to our table, which was really nice.\\n\\nThe space itself is kind of small. It's about three small- to medium-sized rooms with a bathroom in back and a counter with snacks/drinks and the register up front. There is one large shelf up front that is sort of the main area where the games are kept, but there are games stacked up in shelves, cabinets, and a few other places in the cafe. Needless to say, I don't think there's a particular system that the staff use to organize the games. On another note, the furniture isn't uniform, but I think it gives the cafe a lot of character. There are a variety of different tables and chairs, some of which have an antique-y feel to them.\\n\\nThere were a few things from one or both experiences that bothered me, though:\\n\\n1) Each time I went, there was no staff person up front. My boyfriend and I wanted to pay the entrance fee upfront on both occasions we visited, but there was no one there. The second time we went, we stood at the counter uncomfortably for a few minutes. Then we had no choice but to snag a table quickly as more people came in. I think only one person is on staff during each shift.\\n\\n2) There doesn't seem to be a system for the staff to track who pays entrance fee upon entrance and who pays upon exit. I understand that a lot of people come through the doors each day, but the space is pretty small and some people stay for a few hours at a time. The first time I went, Devon asked if we had paid as we were leaving. The second time we had the same issue. The woman who rang us up asked us if we had paid as we were leaving.\\n\\n3) The noise level can be very bad depending on where you're sitting and who's in the cafe that day. The first time I went, my boyfriend and I sat next to a large group of people who were really, really enjoying their game. Lots of whoops and hollering. The second time we went, we were up front near the snacks/drinks counter. The woman on staff that day made a few (blended?) drinks that afternoon. Whatever machine she was using was very loud.\\n\\n4) Some of boxes we picked were missing a few pieces/cards. I saw a sticker on one of the Dominion expansions that indicated the it was demo version donated by Eureka!. I'm not sure if the cards/pieces were missing because it was a demo or because they were misplaced.\\n\\nOverall, both experiences I had there were pretty good. There was a large selection of games to pick from, and the tables are large enough for games that require a large set-up. The noise level can range from distracting to irritating, but once you get into the game, you can get lost in the fun."},{"name":"Jolly Roger","address":"1340 S E 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First time there on Sunday, loved it for watching football!!!

It was topped with a delicious sauce sauce that added the perfect acidity and kick to cut through the richness, and there was a generous pile of home fried potato chips on the side. Yum.

However, if you are up for trying something new, this place is it. I loved the atmosphere--we sat in the heated outdoor patio area. The service was fantastic, and our server answered anything and everything we could ask.

We ordered three meals and 2 sides of rice for the 4 of us. Plenty of food. \\n\\nThe fish sauce wings were tasty, but overly flavorful without rice. You won't regret it.

From the wall of wine to the soccer jerseys hanging from the ceiling, the space just feels authentic. The only thing missing is a giant tantalizing desert case full of cannoli... \\n\\nEvery time I've been there, the host greeted at least a few parties by name. For those regulars, I'm sure this is a friendly and comforting local spot. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. And getting in to this place without an \\"in\\" can be quite tricky. They rarely answer the phone, yet when you arrive, you will likely be (slightly condescendingly) asked, \\"do you have a reservation?\\" If only... Unfortunately, there is no bar to wait at here either, so you're relegated to either loitering on the sidewalk or venturing elsewhere - and timing a drink somewhere else while waiting for your table to be called is a delicate art. So I guess the other missing thing is a bar. That would solve some problems. \\n\\nBut all this hassle is truly worth it for the food. It starts with a delicious basket of bread with balsamic and olive oil. Unfortunately they charge for a refill, which I think is a new policy, and not one that I'm a fan of when I come in ravenous, but I'll move on... Whether you're craving lasagna, pesto, clam sauce, etc., you will not be disappointed. Gino's favorite is probably my favorite too. Their house wine is also tasty and well priced, making for a perfect date night. \\n\\nOverall I love this place, and it is just a hair away from five stars. The food, prices, and atmosphere are really top notch. I haven't really been completely satisfied with the service though, and that is a big part of what you're paying for.

I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes tonight, delicious!\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place where you can catch a quality bite to eat as well as allow your kids to burn off some extra energy Me Too is the place for you.\\n\\nThe price point is right in line with something that you expect from a Red Robin, Shari's, Chili's or similar type chain restaurant. However, this is where the comparison between the chain restaurant stops. The staff is warm and friendly.  They do begin to recognize you and your family overtime. The comparison in another review to a real life version of \\"Cheers for people with small children\\" accurately hit this point on the head! In short, the staff at Me Too are genuine people. They can carry on a conversation that covers multiple topics and even more importantly have the time to do so as they complete job duties.\\n\\nI've eaten at Me Too for both lunch and dinner, multiple times.  The food is good. As another reviewer accurately noted, the food has a niche. It tastes considerably fresher than anything you will be served at a chain restaurant and the comparison to a step above Denny's is accurate. After reading this review and taking your first trip to Me Too, I'd love to hear if you disagree with me. As a parent of two twin boys, I honestly have no regrets ordering anything for my children off their menu. Need something customized, no problem. All of the servers have attended to a special request, substitution or request without hesitation.\\n\\nMe Too is also a great place to meet up with friends that have children.  Don't underestimate the value in this opportunity.  Good food, the kids are taken care of  for $5 bucks & you can have a quality conversation with friends.....Seriously what else do I need to say ;-) \\n\\nSo what is missing? In my opinion, nothing. Tonight,  I was able to allow my kids to play to their hearts content, catch up on those last couple of e-mails from work and ensure my family was fed by a meal equivalent to the quality I would've cooked at home.\\n\\nMe Too fuses all the elements together that are necessary to enable parents and kids to go out and have a great time at the same time.  Try it for yourself & get out there to support something that is truly unique."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been a fan a Rudy's for years.

I ordered the M'Katef, lamb chops in a very nice mint sauce, which was quite good, however.\\n\\nThere is no alcohol severed, so we tried the Cherbet, a lemonade-like drink with the overpowering flavor of rose-hips.

I've eaten at the North End of Boston, and I can honestly say, the food is as Authentic Italian as you can find in the States. I ate there twice, and regret not eating there everyday. My mother was born, raised in Italy, and married my father, a WWII American GI. The food reminded me of my mothers cooking. There is no better review.\\n\\nMy first visit is the same for every Italian restaurant. I order the Pasta Bolognese. If a restaurant can't make this dish, they shouldn't be allowed to call themselves an Italian restaurant.  This is the staple, simple and pure, and unfortunately, ruined in 99% of all Italian restaurants in the  US. But, Piazza Italia's dish was perfect. \\nThe Bolognese sauce was perfection. It wasn't  overly salted, or too much oregano, or too much garlic, or too much ...., or worse sweetened (which is just wrong). All the elements, were in perfect proportions to make what I, on some days, find myself craving to distraction. Needless to say, the Pasta was al dente. Please I beg all chefs in the US, cook the Pasta when ordered!!! Stop the madness, of serving Pasta that is precooked, left over a warming plate and then reheated to be more paste than noodles. \\n\\nNot overly exciting talking about Pasta Bolognese. Nothing earth shattering, just plain and simply good. On to another dish, that shouldn't be hard to make, but once again 99% of of all Italian restaurants in the  US ruin. Pasta Marina, simple Tomato Sauce and Basil. The secret is aromatic and flavorful Tomato Sauce, that doesn't need to be sweetened. My daughter's plate came out, and I could immediately smell the wonderful aroma of the tomato's. Where/how they get their tomato sauce, has to be a secret, because most store tomato's have hardly any smell. Their tomato sauce reminds me of the tomato's of my youth. Yummm....\\n\\nOne more pasta dish, this is truly elegant and wonderful. They had a special seafood, clams, calamari, mussels, shrimp in a tomato sauce. Every bite, had the aroma of a fresh ocean breeze. Everybody at our table stopped talking, because we didn't want to be interrupted while the aroma and taste transported us to a beautiful sunny beach. I should spend more time talking about this phenomenally extraordinary dish, but just suffice it to say, you will not be able to order a Seafood Pasta dish again, because their dish will ruin you against any other \\"pretenders\\",\\n\\nTwo final notes, the Staff (at least our two different waiters) are not to distant transplants from Italy. Very nice, very gracious and very knowledgeable. \\n\\nLastly, I can't leave without talking about dessert. Once again, I do this to every Italian restaurant, I order the tiramisu. I could go into how 99% of all the restaurants ruin this dessert. To be fair, I think it is because we are overly sweetened from all the sodas, donuts, etc. Their tiramisu is sublime. Very light, with all ingredients in perfect balance. Probably one of the best tiramisu's ever.....  \\n\\nThe waiter also brought us out a slice of their torta di nonna. This isn't how I remember my Grand Mother, Nonna Rosa, making this dish. But, to be fair, theirs is better. Somehow, they made their dish lighter and more elegant. \\n\\nTruly, I can't wait to go back to visit my daughter, and go back to Piazza Italia."},{"name":"Don Pedro Mexican Food","address":"18801 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Just an FYI; Don Pedro's is open again!

So I was really looking forward to the Boat for 2, which worth more, could only be better. \\n\\nWe first went on Sunday, March 16th and were told that they no longer do sushi boats on the weekends (despite there being no such fine print on the voucher) because they only had one sushi chef and that there was a sign outside saying so.

The soup was in a bowl that was only half full and warm, rather than hot. The boat we got was a joke.

Fortunately, we were all ready to order our food as well. Drinks took an additional 15 minutes to arrive, with food following at irregular intervals over the next 25 minutes. Not too much of an issue, but half an hour for drinks alone to be served is kind of ridiculous.\\n\\nMy meal itself however was delicious. Kumamato Ramen is a favorite here and I've ordered it many times in the past. The Gyoza is very nice as well. The quality of the food is never been an issue in the many times I've been here in the past.\\n\\nThe handling of our bill was the most bizarre bulshit I have ever experienced at any restaurant in my entire life. When taking our initial order, we asked our server if he would be able to split our checks individually. I understand this is generally tricky with larger groups, and we had 10 people, but our server assured us it would be fine. I've had a large group at Shigezo before do this and had no issues whatsoever; we tipped generously because of it! Shortly before the bill came, our server returned to inform us that actually, he was only able to arbitrarily split the bill 5 ways. Ok.......that's not impossible; 2 people per tab is totally manageable right? We had figured out how we intended to pay, but when the bill came, it was already split for us in random pairings that made no sense. Again, annoying, but manageable.\\n\\nWhat happened over the next HOUR was insane. Our server came to the table FOUR different times because he couldn't understand the way that HE split the bill. I had given him the tab I was responsible for and my card where everything looked intact and it wasn't until an hour later that I finally got my bill and card back so I could leave. We all felt like we were being held hostage, and no explanation was given as to why it took as long as it did to process our bill. The silly part was that if they had just given us separate checks like we had asked for originally, this whole issue could have been easily avoided.\\n\\nFinally, to top it off, before the bill was presented, I had asked for a to-go container for the rest of my ramen I wasn't able to finish. The server took my ramen, looked at me, and said \\"I'll be right back with your ramen!\\" and that was the last I saw of it. By the time the whole debacle with the bill was over and I could leave, I just wanted to get the fuck out of there so badly that I didn't even mention it. It was assuredly long gone.\\n\\nI felt bad for my friends; I had suggested this place based on past experience with large groups where Shigezo has been on point.

I was surprised that he was quite personable. My usual experience at nicer restaurants is that the personnel tend to be a bit stuck-up or \\"all business.\\" While waiting for our food, we asked Jason to take our picture. He did, but he also let us know that a photographer would be coming to take one for us too. They have a photographer!?!\\n\\nWhile we were eating, the photographer did indeed come to take a photo (which turned out so good, I am using part of it as my profile pic on yelp.)

Thus, our souffle (doesn't it take at least a half hour to make these?) was on the table within another few minutes. Seriously, how do they DO that?\\n\\nLastly, a fun fact: When I searched yelp for \\"mortons\\" to write this review, I misspelled and left out the letter T, and unknowingly searched for \\"morons.\\" A certain popular food chain popped up.

And for that amount you get plenty of food. Most Chinese restaurants serve soup in small cup or an equivalent amount bowl size for about $2-$3. Here you get about 5-6 cup size servings of soup. And yummy soup at that. My favorite is the Hot & Sour, fresh shrimp wonton soup and the BBQ pork noodle soup. They are all delicious. \\n\\nMy favorite entree is the orange chicken. It's lightly breaded and fried and then comes out soaking in this wonderful orange and little bit spicy sauce.\\n\\nThe BF has also noticed that the rice always comes out perfectly cooked, and you don't have to ask for any either. \\n\\nIf you are looking for some awesome Chinese food and you want some leftovers, this is the place to go."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came here on a weekday for lunch.

On our drive from Vancouver, BC to LA, we knew we had to stop in Portland for some food. After searching Yelp, we decided on Pok Pok.\\n\\nWe showed up about 20 minutes after opening and were seated promptly. Our server was very friendly and helpful with her recommendations. We were told the best way to order is to do it family style and share our dishes. Between 3 adults, we ordered 2 orders of the fish sauce wings (one hot, one regular), the Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar), Neua Naam Tok (flank steak salad), Kaeng Hang Leh (pork belly & pork shoulder curry), and an order of sticky rice. My spouse also ordered one of the drinking vinegars. \\n\\nThe food arrived and we were all surprised by the portion sizes. For $15+ per plate, we were expecting a little more. But then again, we have never had anything like these dishes, so we were excited to dig in. The boar collar was everyone's favorite. It was delicious and truly unlike anything I've ever had. The flank steak and pork belly were also very good and truly unique. Everyone was especially excited to try the wings! I was sorely disappointed.. I don't know if it has to do with the time of day we went, perhaps the wings spent too long marinating overnight, or perhaps they're just always extremely salty? The taste was there and had so much potential. But the salt content :( My gums were sore for the day after leaving, and I was only able to eat 2.5 before I had to call it quits. \\n\\nOverall, it was a unique experience and I'm glad we went to try it out. The boar collar was a favorite and I hope to find something comparable in Vancouver. Not sure if I would go again though as the price was pretty extravagant for the portion sizes.. and the wings... :("},{"name":"Nate's","address":"306 S Main St, Ste 101","city":"Buda","stars":"3.5","text":"been going there since it opened.. great place to cool off from summer heat.

Our experience wasn't spectacular however I do think Tso has potential as long as they can work out the kinks.\\n\\nI like the simple layout of menu and all inclusive pricing (no delivery charges, no tipping)\\n\\nWait time - we knew it would be a long one based on other comments and reviews we had read. And yes we waited at least an hour for our order placed at 8pm. \\n\\nOrdering - we couldn't find a way to ask that they omit the green bell peppers when ordering so we placed the order. Then we used the customer service chat to ask for no bell peppers but received no response and no communication back. So guess what, we got bell peppers. Not a huge deal and picked them out but kind of wasteful and we can't stand them.\\n\\nCustomization when ordering - asked for spicy on Kung Pao and the dish came mild at best. Such a bummer. Tasted good but would have been so much better with some spice.\\n\\nAccuracy - we ordered and paid for egg rolls however they did not make it in our delivered order. Another bummer after such a long wait.\\n\\nPortion size - not huge and could be better but not too bad. We did end up with way more rice than entree/meat which is unfortunate. Would prefer more entree and less rice.\\n\\nThree issues with one order and on our very first order are usually reason to pause and consider other options.

I have to note that I am super sensitive to spicy food. So while I found the first two dishes we ordered (a chicken dish and a calamari dish) to be boring because the sauces were too spicy for me and I opted to eat them plain. Someone who enjoys spice may love them. The chicken was cooked to perfection so that  was a plus. \\n\\nSo, I'm sitting there being like this place has great atmosphere, the staff is friendly and attentive, it's open air, the drinks are great, this sticky rice is great.

The second round of food he ordered was fantastic. The fish sauce wings are amazing and I think it was the curry noodle soup that I flipped over.

It's fun as a gimmick maybe once or twice but after a few times the fun wears off.  Unless you come very early or very late, the wait to get a table is pretty interminable.  Part of that is probably due to the popularity of the place but a great deal has to do with the inefficiency of the staff.  First of why does it take forever for the staff to clear a table so that the next party can eat?  I saw a manager type walk in, surveyed the scene and just walked out despite multiple tables that needed to be cleared.  The front of house people seem to have no other purpose but to tell you your wait time and display post-modern ennui.  Are there not enough financial incentives to get more seatings in?  \\n\\nSecondly, yes there are menu items, but most people are here to do the DIY pancake thing.  Why does it take forever for the waitress to first take your order and then to bring your bottles of pancake batter?  Are they growing the wheat in their back yard, harvesting it, milling it and then mixing it with the eggs they have to get from their own free-range chickens roaming on the roof and the milk they get from their GMO-free cows in their barn every time you order a bottle of batter?  \\n\\nAnd what is this controlling attitude with the oil?  After a few pancakes, the griddle is sticky and crusted.  But the bottles of oil are nowhere to be found.  And of course it takes another eternity to flag down a server to squirt some more oil on the griddle.  \\n\\nMost of the attraction of this place is for the kids.  There are a *lot* of small children at this place.  But if you really think about it, would you really let your small children stand by an open stove at home flipping pancake?  You probably wouldn't let them close to the range.  So why is it OK to subject them to the same risks and pay someone else to do so?\\n\\nMy hat off to the owners though.

We had to wait 30 minutes after eating for the check to come.  I should've gone up and asked someone else for the check but it was getting comical and figured it would make the yelp review better.

Not \\"bad\\" food, just not great or even good really.\\n\\nOur server essentially disappeared after a runner brought the food. Since we didn't need anything I wasn't too concerned but noticed she kept checking on the table next to ours where four men sat down after us. She would literally check with them, turn and leave.

Not my favorite thing to sit and wait for a check when we're finished and the dishes have been cleared.\\n\\nLast slightly off thing: as we left, another couple was just ahead of us and the hostess said goodbye or something similar as they walked out the door.

But I honestly have to say that I (and the group of people I was with) loved it! Yes, the menu at Ceviche is overwhelming...there are probably about 100 menu items to choose from. We decided to ask our waitress for her recommendations in each category (Pescados, Carne, Tablas, etc). That ended up helping us a lot, and I feel like we all enjoyed the unique dishes we got. The best part? We all got to try a little bit of each dish! \\n\\nAs far as drinks go, I split a pitcher of Skinny Sangria with my friend. The only difference between this and the regular sangria, we were told, is that it is made with sweetener rather than real sugar. That being said, the Skinny Sangria is perhaps not for everyone. But, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was light enough that it didn't fill me up, and, therefore, I could eat more tapas! \\n\\nRemember how I said the best part was getting to share food? I was lying. The best part of the night was the chocolate cake we ordered for dessert. Chocolate cake, fresh fruit, and a splash of orange liqeur on the side.

A very nice contrast of textures. Though I do wish that the waffle was more crispy to counteract the gravy a bit. The tiny morsels of meat in the gravy was great. The flavor was just a tad sweet, but I'd definitely order it again.\\n\\nI enjoyed my waffle so much I couldn't stay away and made a second trip back a few days later. This time, I ordered the ABC (arugula, bacon, and camembert). It was a harmony of flavors. The arugula and camembert was a refreshing contrast to the texture of the bacon. You get crispy, crunchy, chewy, melted goodness all in one bite! The fig jam adds a nice, subtle, sweet aftertaste. This was definitely money, but did wish the waffle was fresh. \\n\\nYes, all I did in Portland was stuff my face and expand my waist, but it was worth every bit of it!!"},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"We went there for a weekday lunch, and it was great for the price.

I opted for a few of the refreshing Island Creek Oysters ($2 each). \\n\\nFor my dinner entree I enquired about the Poached Sole ($28), and our waiter was able to elaborate extensively on it, and quickly sold me. The sole was poached and plated in a circular fashion, topped with lobster cream sauce, lentils and tempura sage leaves. I'd never heard of tempura sage leaves, but they added both texture and flavor balance to the almost bouillabaisse-like sauce topping the fluffy white sole.

I'm being generous with the 3 stars because they have such a cool looking restaurant and very nice outdoor patio area, perfect for summer drinks. \\n\\nMy critique is really on the service as it was lacking that day. I went for lunch with my coworkers for a celebration. We were one of the first tables there as we went before the rush. We got a nice picnic table on the patio. It's nice because it has a couple trees for a breeze and it is tucked away from any trace of car traffic. There's even a kayak rental place nearby making you wish you didn't have to go back to work. Anyways, we were one of the first there and last to leave, there were 6 of us, so not a HUGE party. I think our waiters/waitresses were sharing us but service was very far and in between. Our lunch hour turned into a 2 hour meal. We waited a while in between finishing our lunch and getting our dessert on the table. First we had to ask if they had dessert because we were about to be given the check. Four of us ordered ice cream and two ordered milkshakes. Remember, we were the last table there, no competition on the serving front. It took literally 20 minutes to get our dessert. Twenty minutes doesn't seem that long but between waiting for service to order our lunch to waiting to have the table cleared to waiting to order dessert to waiting for dessert, it was a little exhausting. Ok fine, shakes take time, but ice cream? You just scoop it. Even the hostess stepped in to fill our water twice.\\n\\nAside from the lackluster service, the lunch menu was pretty decent as was the food itself. Again, love the outdoor patio and love that there's a market in the restaurant. I'm hoping they work out the kinks in their service, maybe after work drinks is more acceptable for this kind of service (maybe-but probably not as people want their drinks!) but lunch service in the busy Kendall Square area with all the offices around, they'll have to speed it up, otherwise it'll be such a shame."},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is absolutely one of the best restaurants ever!

I've had southern style BBQ in Berkeley, CA but didn't realize what these were trying to accomplish until I came to Texas.

I thought to myself at the time, wow, if this is what it's like at a restaurant next to a gas station, how much better the other, 'grander' places will be? I found I was wrong. Some places have better sauce, some places have better beef ribs (like Ironworks in downtown Austin). But despite going to several different renowned BBQ places (including Salt Lick), I have found no brisket to compare with Rudy's extra-moist brisket. Of course, the reason it's extra-moist is because practically every grain of the beef is marbled about with a thin layer of fat, but it tastes oh-so-good. Perfect crunch on the extreme perimeter where it's gotten seared, great pink-colored smoke ring, and incredible flavor that really doesn't even need sauce.\\n\\nSlap 2 pieces of brisket, raw onion, and pickle into a piece of fresh white bread - ain't nothin' better this side of heaven!

I got the Goddess dish ($8.55)- apparently their signature- and while I was worried that the ginger sauce would be overwhelming because I'm not always a huge fan of ginger, it was actually tangy, creamy, and delicious. I was also worried about the abundance of leafy greens in the dish because while I am a committed lover of vegetables, I can't find it in myself to stomach kale. However, the crunchiness of the beets and carrots, the good amount of brown rice and quinoa, and the great sauce were really a good combination and left me full but not bloated (always my goal in a meal). Oh, and I also tried the chai smoothie ($5.89 for a mason jar size)- amazing in its subtlety; I plan on making this at home sometime very soon. (Maybe when it's not 13 degrees outside, so like, in July.)\\nMy picky, meat-and-potatoes fianc√© wasn't won over- this place was just too granola for him, which our friend and I knew it would be from the get-go. So if you don't know how to pronounce \\"quinoa\\" and have ever summarized vegetarian food as \\"like eating a plate of grass,\\" this is not the place for you, and nothing will change that. But if you are a generally healthy, vegetarian/vegan-leaning person, I can't promise that this will be your new favorite place, but it is worth a try- the food definitely surpassed my expectations."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This evening I had a wonderful dinner at Morton's steakhouse.

We asked if it was possible to sit downstairs at the bar and we were informed to we could just go inside (instead of waiting for a table), since the bar was apparently empty.\\nYes - it was \\"apparently\\" empty. There were around 5 or 6 employees congregating at the bar downstairs. And the presence of customers did not intimidate them at all. From the time we got there (9am) until the time we left (10:30am), there were still a few of them laughing out loudly, as if that was not their workplace, but their living room, instead. \\n\\nWe went upstairs to get some food and suddenly there is a waitress chastising us - in front of everybody else - because, apparently, we could not have started serving our plates from the specific table where we were. We should get in line, in front of the other table, and then move to the other tables from there. \\n\\nFirst of all, there is no indication/signal or anything whatsoever to inform the customers about where the line is supposed to start or from what table we are supposed to serve our plates from.\\nAnd the thing is: we wanted the specific food which was on the specific table where we went. And there was absolutely nobody else at that table. Which means: we were not cutting the line in front of anyone else. If there was a line for that specific table, we would have followed it.\\n\\nNow: why on earth would I have to get in line at - what was supposed to be - the \\"main table\\" or the \\"starting table\\", since what we wanted was on the other table?\\n\\nWe are not to be blamed for the fact that the space is not well divided and well organized, and they allow the place to get so packed that you can hardly move around.\\n\\nIt was an extremely unpleasant situation and the tone that she used was extremely rude. I tried to explain to her why we were serving from the other table, but she just walked away.\\n\\nApart from the \\"incident with the waitress\\" and the \\"congregation of employees at the bar\\", the amount of people allowed inside while they wait for a table is ridiculous. While we were eating there were at least 3 different groups standing close by and staring at us in order to see when we were leaving, so that they could have our seats.

Kudos for sharing the delay with the customer. In the meantime, he brought out some chips and salsa to gnosh (had to request this). \\n\\nThirty minutes comes and goes, as does 45 and still no food. I ask our waiter the status and he says that it should be out in 5 minutes. Still no food after 1 hour; finally at 1hour 15minutes after placing the order, our food arrives. By this time, multiple other parties that were seated when we arrived or after us have ordered, been served, eaten, are paying (paid) their bill and are leaving (left). When raising this point with the waitstaff (we asked to speak with a manager, but no one was available), their excuse is that they were short a chef and that caused the delay.  This is infuriating as this doesn't explain why our food came out soo much later than other customers who arrived after us - our order was off the brunch menu, nothing complicated. \\n\\nFor future reference - 1) ask if the kitchen is slammed, and then ask the waitstaff for a realistic wait time for your food. Had we known it would take 1hr 15mins, we would have found a different place 2) keep the restaurant accountable so that your order isn't an after thought in their kitchen's cooking lineup.

I also think I might of had at least 5-6 cups of coffee while I was there, it was good and tasted very fresh.

Of course, anyplace that is highly touted can sometime disappoint.  Not so!  Sure, the wait is long, but they will text you when your table is ready, so why not head down to salt and straw for a little \\"dessert first\\" action?  We did.  Then we received our awaited message and hustled down to be seated in the funky, charming front area.  First of all, it felt like Thailand to me - bustling, filled with aroma, and that indoor-outdoor vibe so common to the tropics.  All I was missing was the sparkling Andaman Sea out the door and I could have been back on Ko something-or-other.  Of course, the fact that it was a sticky 90+ degree humid heatwave in Portland may have helped.  But never mind all that, what of the food?  For me, and my party of six, it was excellent.  My niece kept taking bites, closing her eyes, and saying \\"wow.\\"  I felt the same way.  Glass noodles with prawns and pork belly were packed with carmelized flavor; the larp moo was a porky, limey, spicy mouth-splosion; the wings were a total sticky flavor bomb; the pork belly curry succulent and delicious.  In short, I think every dish we ordered delivered the hoped-for mix of spicy, salty, sweet and succulent.  The texture was there, the yum-factor was there, and though the price was a little high, and the ambiance a little hectic, I would most definitely go back anytime I was in Portland.

It was delicious, chilled, and very refreshing. I've never thought about infusing pandan into water, so I'm glad I got to try it! My favorite food dish though was the Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. However, they were on the salty side, so eating them with rice is highly recommended. The Cha Ca La Vong was ok, although I've had much better in California. The Kung Op Wung Sen was very tasty and caramelized in the clay pot, although there were barely any pork belly pieces in there. The special Winged Beans were really flavorful and had a great crunch to them. The Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar) was interesting and a bit on the spicy side, but I don't think I would order that again. My party ended dinner with the Pok Pok Affogato, which I really enjoyed. The condensed milk ice cream was delicious, but can get overwhelmingly sweet, so I would definitely try to share this with a group.\\n\\nLuckily, my party had reservations, so we didn't have to wait at all to be seated.

We also ordered the peanuts but when the other food came out first and no peanuts we asked to cancel that part of the order.  I don't like super spicy food and asked about spice vs. no spice on the wings, the waiter informed me that the spice was really not that hot so I went ahead and ordered them spicy and it was the perfect level of heat.  Good tip from the waiter.  Loved the brussel sprouts, just the right amount of fish sauce.  Glad we ordered the jasmin rice because it tasted so good with the brussel sprout sauce.  My partner really enjoyed his game hen, but apparently when they chopped up the bird prior to serving it they cut through the bone and he had a couple of unexpected slim slivers of bone in the chicken.

When we got there, there was 20 minute wait, and 10 people were standing outside the restaurant (a fire hazard!). That was a good sign in itself, but the wait was less favorable. When I finally entered, after forever, I realized why the place was so small: The kitchen took up 35% of the space! But it was nice to see how your food was made.\\nNow I'm giving it 3 stars because I only tried the blank ink pasta. I think the squid ink hardened the noodles, so it wasn't your typical soft noodles--they were chewy, and by that I mean you needa chomp kinda vigorously. I tried two pastas: the puttanesca and the anglio olio. The noodles came in a flat pan. The puttanesca was a mixture of olives, tomato sauce, onions-3 stars for that one.

Lemonade served with rose petals... while the recipe could have been better, I appreciated the attention to detail of adding the rose petals.  You could probably make your own at home using a standard lemonade recipe + rose water (the petals are just for flair).  Theirs was too syrupy sweet for my taste, but I give them credit for the originality, and it does taste pretty nice.\\nJbinet with Berber Karmous (plate of Mediterranean cheeses, appetizer) - a letdown.  there was only one type of cheese in said platter, + a handful of onion, leafiness, and figs.  The cheese tastes nice alongside the figs.  No more comments.\\nMelkha (Eggplant + feta and gruyere on couscous, entree) - nice idea, but I wasn't crazy about the gruyere + couscous. This was not my dish though, I just tried it from someone else.  They thought it was pretty good.\\nMelfouf la Kasbah (sampling of meats + vegetables and french fries, entree) - ummm $18 for a measly lamb sausage, a teeny chicken skewer, and a teeny lamb skewer next to some fries? and what veggies?  I call overpriced.  Tasty, but still a ripoff.  Maybe on better days they are more generous with the protein.\\nClassical couscous (vegetable couscous, entree) - served in a wooden bowl with a wooden spoon, I guess that's supposed to feel pretty authentic.  It tasted good, though they were a tad skimpy with the vegetables.  I could name the 5 chunks of plant matter I had in my bowl right now, but I won't bore you.  Oh, and I counted two garbanzo beans.\\nDessert of the day - some traditional fried cookies sprinkled with sesame seed.  They tasted sweet, greasy, and a tad dull, kind of like donuts, but they're worth a try and served with mint tea.\\nTurkish coffee - ok now this is interesting stuff.  I haven't tried Turkish coffee elsewhere, so I can't compare this relative to other places.  However, I will that if you like coffee, you should try this.  It is *strong*.  Strong as in, it gets chewy towards the bottom.  Oh yeah.  It comes out sweetened and spiced with cardamom, which lends it a distinctive taste, but they use no cream.  That's for sissies.\\n\\nLocale and service:\\nBaraka Cafe is tiny.  I would estimate it seats about 25 people max.  They take reservations for groups of 4 or more.  Do yourself a favor and make a resy if you can.  Even if you think you're going earlier than the crowd, it's such a tiny place you just don't know if it could fill up.\\nA staff of three was running the cafe on a Friday night: 1) a waiter who doubled as drinks preparer, and I think made some dishes as well.  2) the apparently psychotic chef (who was on good behavior the night I went, despite my fears after reading the reviews on here), and 3) an older guy who mainly sat around, but sometimes pitched in preparing food and bringing it out.  Bottom line: Service is friendly, but sloooowwww.  Go when you have time to kick back and wait for your food, else you won't enjoy the experience as much.\\n\\n3 stars.

The Bloody Mary was too full of horseradish in my opinion, but I've come to expect that from seafood restaurants. My Sherry Cobbler was perfectly balanced and delicious. The food wasn't even close to living up to my expectations. The mid-day menu is so small that you would think that whatever they did put on it would be great. The clam chowder had maybe 1 or 2 super tiny chopped clams in it. It was more about the bacon. The grilled shrimp and pork hot dog, which our bartender did warn us of its small size, while tasting good, was super small compared to the bun. It's not even as thick as a regular hotdog.

We ordered the Kung Op Wun Sen and Khao Soi Kai. I personally think this place is overrated, overhyped and overpriced for the food they're serving. \\n\\nKung Op Wu Sen is gulf prawns baked in a clay pot with bean glass noodles. There were like 2 pieces of prawns in there which was enough for my sis and I to each try it out. The prawns were not good because the shell would stick to the prawns when peeling it. Shrimp did not taste fresh at all. The waiter told us to mix the noodles up with the sauce on the bottom of the pot in which I did. I thought the dish was too salty after mixing it up a bit. I ended up dipping the noodles into the curry noodle soup because the soup was very bland which made the salty glass noodles taste good.\\n\\nKhao Soi Kai is curry noodle soup with chicken. The chicken was a bit dry and rough in my opinion. The curry noodle soup was made with real coconut milk confirmed by the waiter before ordering, but I barely tasted coconut. The soup had no flavors to it whatsoever, but then I remembered the waiter telling us to use fish sauce when eating the noodle soup. I put a couple drops on my spoon and ate it with noodles. It was super salty which made me think the only flavor to the soup was to put in the fish sauce. I don't think that's what fish sauce is for. Fish sauce should be additional flavor to the curry noodle soup and not the main flavor. I didn't taste curry whatsoever either nor was it slightly spiced. \\n\\nI didn't have the chance to try the fish sauce chicken wings, but the table next to me did. The girl said the outside is salty and inside of the chicken was very bland and had no taste at all, so it was only the exterior that was flavored. They didn't definitely marinate any of the food that we had. I think the quality of the food went down now that this place has been hyped up by so many people. I will definitely not come back again.

The server said he had no idea what that was, but figured that the bar should know. Thankfully my gamble worked out and I ended up with a perfectly balanced refreshing cocktail. We shared the crabcake to start, which was really great - good sized, and fresh and flavorful, not overly heavy and breaded like some commercial seafood joints.\\n\\nI ordered up the seared striped bass, she had the hamburger, and he had half a dozen oysters and the fried fish sandwich. I take his word that the oysters were amazing, and the sandwich just as good. My other friend appreciated that the burger was exactly as she ordered it, but was disappointed that it was a little on the small side. I was also a tad disappointed with my fish, which was overcooked to the point where I had to use my knife to cut pieces from a filet that should just flake apart. The broth was really tasty, but the fish had had the flavor cooked right out of it.\\n\\nLuckily, we ordered up dessert: chocolate pudding, blueberry shortcake, and the housemade ice cream sandwich.

The best part after the food is the super cool laid back atmosphere, excellent service and reasonable pricing. They did a good job creating a true Italian cafe like the ones in small towns in Italy. It's not fussy dining but nice enough for a special occasion or date night but casual enough to come however you are. Classic PDX chic. \\n\\nSo my wife and I ate here for our anniversary. We had the spinach salad, fettuccini bolognese, pappardelle with sausage and mushrooms, tiramisu and a half bottle of preseco. So here is how  I would beak it down:\\n1. Spinach salad 4/5: really nice Gorgonzola, shaved Parmesan, olives and balsamic vinaigrette.  Good quality vinegar and just the right amount not overdressed. \\n2. Fettuccini with Bolognese Sauce 5/5: this was our first time eating here and we always get the bolognese sauce because it is actually one of the hardest sauces to execute really well because it takes all day. The bolognese was excellent, broke da mouth good. I was tempted to lick the plate but it was our anniversary. Ha ha, no cave man stuff. The pasta was freshly made and cooked al dente with the perfect amount of \\"chew\\". For \\"noodle folk\\" it's all about \\"the chew\\". \\n3. Pappardelle with sausage and mushroom 5/5: I am not a big fan of heavy cream based pasta sauces but I do like the light cream sauces with tomato and was interested to see how it worked with sausage and mushroom. My oh my, another home run. A very light cream sauce with a generous amount is sausage and mushrooms. The fresh pappardelle was the best I have had outside of Italy. Again, not complex but executed to perfection which isn't easy. \\n4. Tiramisu 5/5: We were stuffed after the pasta and were going to pass on desert but they brought us the tiramisu for free because it was our anniversary. Very nice to do that. I don't usually eat deserts but my wife said it was the best tiramisu she has ever had. Not heavy like the other times.

We were redeeming our \\"tasting\\" menu that we purchased as part of Commonwealth's Kickstarter campaign. They set expectations up front about what was coming--a couple of appetizers, entrees, and desserts.\\n\\nOn top of the \\"free\\" food we ordered some oysters and drinks. For drinks I had the Nookie and a Vitamin C; I was a fan of the Nookie but the Vitamin C was a bit too sweet and intense for my liking. Nothing wrong with it if you're into that, but be forewarned. My fiance had a Cuba Libre--nothing too new there but a quality execution. Oysters were reliable and tasty.\\n\\nThey sent out the spinach/apple salad as well as the romaine/quinoa salad. Both were pretty high quality. We both preferred the richer flavor of the cheddar and pecans on the spinach salad but the romaine was light without sacrificing too much flavor; the olives helped give it a kick of flavor.\\n\\nEntrees were tasty as well. Relatively, the monk fish impressed us more than the skirt steak but both were flavorful and well cooked. There are a few reviews that critique the strategy of sending out a la carte entrees that you get to pair with sides. We certainly prefer it that way and the brussels sprouts, broccoli, and mashed potatoes meant we had more than enough food. You could definitely get away with a starch and a single vegetable for 2 people. The brussels spouts and mashed potatoes were standouts. The broccoli was: broccoli. It was tasty steamed broccoli but only as tasty as steamed broccoli can be. I wouldn't order it again; it was probably the only \\"meh\\" part of our meal. \\n\\nBy the time desserts rolled around, we were both pretty full. So when they sent out two options we were only able to have a couple of bites of each (oh well). The brownie + pb&j ice cream + marshmallow was fantastic. We also had some apple beignets + chai ice cream. Neither of us are big fans of the chai flavor profile but the beignets were delicious--lots of great brown sugar on the outside. Dessert would be worth ordering if you go.\\n\\nThe reason I'm leaving a 4 instead of a 5-star review is the service. We ordered 8 oysters but they initially brought 4; the other 4 were delayed until after the appetizers arrived so I'm not sure we would have even pointed out the error (which they graciously acknowledged) if we had known there would be a delay. The bigger issue came after the meal. Our waitress disappeared for a solid 15-20 minutes. Couldn't find her to grab the check. The table next to us was seated and ordered drinks at the beginning of that block and called over a manager when they couldn't find our same waitress. She apologized to both of us which was nice but didn't even have the other couples' drinks when she came back. I point that out more to illustrate that it was a weird situation than I do to critique her lack of bringing their drinks. \\n\\nWe'll absolutely be going back for another visit. If they can iron out a couple of kinks in the service, I'd give it 5 stars."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Sam Lagrassa's does indeed make a masterful sandwich.  I tend to stick with the grilled specialties, but the more classic pastrami and Reuben sandwiches look expertly crafted with excellent ingredients.  As is traditional with east coast delis, the meat is piled so high the sandwiches can be difficult to eat (even for a bigmouth like myself).  If you go for a full meal, the fries are a must add: always hot and tasty.  I regret failing to include the noun \\"sandwich\\" in the previous sentence.

I didn't taste the prawns, but had some pork belly with noodles. This was also tasty, but not something that you slowly savored every bite like the boar collar. It comes medium spicy, by my calibrated pallet, with a side of greens to cleanse said pallet.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and very attentive once we had ordered.

I've heard so many good things about this place and was really underwhelmed. I thought it was pretty cool that the whole restaurant was pretty much two houses combined. My family and I ordered the pok pok wings, papaya salad, Sunny's Yam Wun Sen Chao Wang, and the Muu Sateh. Each plate was about 15 dollars, portions weren't that big.\\n\\nThe pok pok wings were the best part of the meal. There were 7 wings that were deliciously seasoned with fish sauce and came off the bones easily. They were a bit salty for me, but enjoyable nonetheless. The wings came with pickled vegetables so if you ate it together, it balanced a bit of the saltiness out. The papaya salad wasn't too special. It came with a wedge of iceberg, shredded papaya, and then a scoop of rice with some shredded pork on top. It had a strong kick to it at the end, so prepare for that! It was good, but like I said earlier nothing special. Next came the Sunnys yam wun sen chao wang which was a plate of glass noodles. This was very spicy, but probably the second best plate. I only took about two bites, but the flavor just bursted as soon as you put it in your mouth. So If you like really spicy food, this would be a pick. Lastly was the Muu Sateh which was pork loin skewers that came with peanut sauce. This was probably the most disappointing dish. It was dry and had no flavor whatsoever. I had to drench it in sauce to get through it. Aside from these dishes, we also ordered thai tea, which came in a bottle. I might be biased just because I'm from California and have had so many different thai teas, but this tea wasn't anything special, it was a small bottle and cost 4 dollars! I can get just as much tea at Banana Bay for half the price. \\n\\nLastly, our waiter's attitude was terrible. You could tell he didn't want to be there and he didn't seem to enjoy his job. He barely spoke to us and when he came to take our orders or drop off drinks, he had a stank face each time. Overall, I thought the place was over priced and over hyped.

It's fair service, but 18% (after tax) tip pre-included on bill for only a party of two just didn't seem fair for customers. \\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nI really want to like this place. Trust me, I did as I rave about this place to my fianc√© before our Boston trip. But I have to be really honest here, so hear me out on my review for this place. I stayed a couple blocks down the road for my vacation at Boston. Everyday when I walked pass The Daily Catch during Labor Day weekend I would see a line of crowd wrapped around the corner of this building.. so I told myself to come here on my last day of my trip, which is a Tuesday right after Labor Day weekend. We got here at 5:30pm right before the dinner rush and we lucked out on probably only a 5 minute wait. It was indeed a small place, and with three staff altogether; the chef, the bus boy, and the server, they ran a smooth service. Our server, she was quite nice as being the only server here, you could easily be grouchy and impatient, but she was swift and polite to us. We ordered the calamari scampi, Sicilian style littlenecks, and the famous aglio olio, the black ink pasta with grounded squid. Being seafood lovers, we had been really looking forward to the aglio olio and I had intentionally put this as our last meal of our trip, hoping it would be the sweet ending to our vacation.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it really did not meet our expectations. The calamari scampi was fresh, I enjoyed the rich garlicky sauce but my fianc√© thought there was a bit too much acid making the sauce a little too sour for his taste. The littleneck clams were plump and juicy but seasoning was salty. I usually like to eat the clams as I dipped them in their drippings, but they were too salty when I did that. The wine wine actually did not burn off entirely so there is a strong wine taste.. Last but not least, our much anticipated aglio olio were served and at first, we were super excited as it was served in the pans it was cooked in and it had an awesome rustic feel to it. But biting into the first bite, I was quite disappointed. Although the squid ink pasta had a good chew to it, it still had that al dente touch to it, but it lacked seasoning altogether. At first you have that briny squid ink taste but following that it had a doughy uncooked flour taste to the end. The ground saut√©ed squid didn't bind to the pasta, and even when I did intentionally scoop out bits of ground ink with the pasta it still tasted slightly bland like there was no sauce to really tie it together. I had to season it myself with salt and lots of red pepper to make it more flavorful.\\n\\nIn the end, when we got our bill, we were surprised to be billed for 18% gratuity after tax (which was 25% pre-tax) and it was included in our bill.. and it was for just the two of us. Even fine dining wouldn't force and impose such bills on their customers. Plus the service was just okay considering how busy our server was. But I didn't want to make a scene on the spot, but decided I should write about my experience here on Yelp... \\n\\nTo be honest, it was quite an underwhelming experience. I left slightly disappointed and ripped off, but imagined if I had wait hours in line, I would have probably dropped another star...

This spot is located near 5 other eateries; 4 major chain places and 1 wing truck which is real nice (Rahim's Chicken).  This morning as I headed to the store I gave one of my neighbors a ride as well since we were headed in the same direction.  She told me she was going to the Diner for breakfast and I asked how the food, she said she went over there all the time and the food was GREAT!  So that's all i needed to hear!\\n\\nDecided to head over there for lunch a few minutes ago and when you walk in you immediately see the juke box at the door on your right and the stools at the bar and the benches throughout the place.  You smell the clorox and hear the southern hospitality. \\"hey how you doing, how can i help ya.\\" I loved it!  I looked at their health grade and it's an 88...eh! good enough for me.  So I sat at one of the stools and told my waitress that I wanted a good greasy cheeseburger and requested to have my onions grilled with fries.  I almost put some money in the jukebox but knew I needed to get home.  LOL So about 15 minutes later, my total is $4.63...waaaay cheaper than the two nearest major chain eateries nearby.

Great job guys on the creme brule, I would walk on hot coals just to come here for it.\\n\\nPrice point: 3 stars: the joint is pricey, both times we have come we have spent $130 for dinner for 2 adults and 2 children and today for lunch we spent $85 for 2 adults and 2 children. The prices could be a little lower considering the portion sizes don't match the price point imo. The swordfish  had for dinner on fathers day, I completed in about 5-6 bites, and that's a $30 dish. At least at stoney river up the street when you pay $30 a dish you are presented with a hearty dish! Prices could be $5 lower again considering the amount of food you are getting. \\n\\nOverall: I give a solid 4 stars for the following reasons; on father's day we had to request bread to accompany our soup when we saw other tables getting it as soon as they sat down. The children fries a very salty so if you order your children fries please tell them no salt. The first time we disregarded it because it was busy and father's day, today it was no the fries are really salty here. The price point isn't worth the value but the food is good. The children's menu needs more variety but the price point is great. The adult menu could be cheaper on some items considering you don't give a large food portion. I would've had to order 2 swordfish dishes to get full as where when I've eaten at stoney river and ordered the tuna I couldn't even finish the dish because I was so full. I know swordfish costs more than tuna, ijs I got what I paid for. I would come back because I believe these minor complaints can be ironed out. Hopefully the next time I come I can give them 5 stars.

I was aware of this restaurant, but never made it in before.  After all, it's a pizza joint, right?  And pizza joints are mostly the same, right?  \\n\\nWell, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and the personalized service here -- so rare, particularly when you're in \\"restaurant row\\" near a fairly major mall.\\n\\nTo begin with; if you're into local craft beer, you'll be pleased with the beer selection.  While they don't have as big a selection that a craft brewery offers, they do have a decent variety of craft beers from several local breweries -- especially in light of the fact that this is a pizza place and not some grunge beer-bar downtown.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, I had the \\"pretzel bites\\" that came with tomato sauce and beer cheese for dipping (thanks to a free Yelp coupon).  I was really impressed with the flavor of the beer cheese!  This appetizer is quite filling, so it's best to share this one.\\n\\nI wasn't in the mood for pizza, so I ordered the meatballs from the entree menu. The order comes with three meatballs, sliced in half and forming a sandwich of cheese between the halfs.  The meatballs are skewered back to together and topped with a combo of tomato sauce, shaved parmesan cheese and fresh basil.  What I liked most about these meatballs was that each bite tasted differently than the previous bite, depending upon which fresh herb or cheese made it to your fork. The consistency of the meatball itself was very good as well - not too crumbly.  In spite of their average size appearance, they were quite filling.\\n\\nOur waiter, Uriah, was very personable, explaining the menu to us and checking back frequently, but not excessively.  The owner, Ron Brown, stopped by at our table to say \\"hi\\" and to make sure that we were enjoying our meal, as well as our visit to his restaurant. \\n\\nReally, everyone we met here was very friendly.

The ambience is dramatic and gorgeous, and although the restaurant is generally packed, I still feel like my sweetie and I are the only two people in the room. Maybe it's the acoustics. But I digress...\\n\\nThe food. The bone-in ribeye is so amazing. At medium rare, it's perfectly crisped on the outside and juicy and flavorful on the inside. Although the steak is wonderful on its own, the truffle butter just takes it over the top.  The porterhouse and the filet are also very good, but I think the ribeye is the highlight of the menu. All sides have always been very good, but I adore the Gruyere sweet potatoes and the jalape√±o corn. I will admit that I haven't loved all appetizers, like the lobster fritters and bone marrow, but it wasn't because they weren't properly executed - just personal preference.  Chops definitely wins the steak tartar competition though. Desserts have always been wonderful. \\n\\nKevin Rathbun is often in the restaurant and he sometimes stops by tables.

The wings were tasty and the papaya salad was interesting albeit a bit too spicy for our taste.  Overall a pleasant experience with okay service and interesting menu.  \\n\\nThat being said, this place is way overpriced.  We were charged $5 for a tiny glass of Vietnamese iced coffee.  They also brought the coffee mixed instead of with the coffee drip above condensed milk.  $5 for two tiny servings of sticky rice?!?  The wings ($15) were good and flavorful, but I thought the price was surprising.  Also the papaya salad ($9) was probably the most overpriced item other than the rice.  The curry ($15) was the most fair priced.  \\n\\nSo this is a foodie haunt and I guess that is how they justify the prices.  I also know that the food is made painstakingly from scratch and that does justify a higher ticket.  Still, it was $60 for the above mentioned items.  If the meal had been about $15 less I would have thought it was reasonable.  I get that the food is good, but I must admit when I left feeling like I had payed way too much for what we had.  \\n\\nWas it good?  Yes.  Was it worth $60?  Not really for me.

In fact, it has become very stratified with TexMex vs Interior Mex etc.  Where Austin lacks is diversity of food from South America and Cuba.\\n\\nGuantanamera is a welcome addition to the very limited Cuban and Carribean  restaurants in town.\\n\\nFor those who eat a lot of Mexican food, Cuban food may seem bland because it is not as flavorful and doesn't focus on peppers and spices.  For those who are familiar with Cuban food, Guantanamera is very authentic with a nice blend of home-style dishes along with the dishes that are typically served in restuarants.\\n\\nThe starters are a good selection of the stables of Cuban appetizers.  The croquetas are good.  The maduros are nicely carmelized.  The tostones were a little underdone (a bit chewy).  The empanadas are delicious are were the best of the choices.\\n\\nThe arroz con pollo was very good with very generous portions.  The ropa vieja was also very good in a Cuban comfort-food kind of way.  The bistec de pollo was authentic with generous portions however the meat could have been a bit more tenderized and prepared before it was breaded.  \\n\\nFor desert, both the guava/cheese empanadas and the flan cubano were excellent.\\n\\nPros:  very well-prepared and authentic Cuban food with a nicely rounded-out menu and very generous portions.  Easy parking and nice interior decor.\\n\\nCons:  each time we've been to the restaurant, it has been packed- even at off hours.  There seems to be a lot of large parties and families at the restaurant.  The host was a bit cool when we were offered a table that was about 2 feet from the door and asked if there were another choice.  In his defense, there were only two tables available.  It's a small space and it would not be too much of a surprise if they either open a second location or expand into a larger space.  \\n\\nThe popularity of the restaurant seems to be taking its toll on the waitstaff since it is very difficult to manage large groups and several smaller tables simultaneously.  This popularity makes the service inconsistent (although the servers were very nice they were obviously overloaded).  \\n\\nOn a related note:  It's not unusual to see large families at a Cuban restaurant.  However, for families who are going to take their children out to nice restaurants, it is an opportunity to also teach your children how to conduct themselves in public.  On one of my visits to this restaurant, a family group where the children outnumbered the adults also left a considerable amount of their food on the floor of the restaurant which meant that several servers were required to clean up after them.  That was time that could have been spent refilling glasses and expediting food.  It's inconsiderate and poor manners to allow children to throw food on the floor and servers take the brunt of the mess afterward."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"210 Boylston St, Ste 13","city":"Chestnut Hill","stars":"2","text":"The seats are so uncomfortable here, but the design is nice here!

Everyone has different tastes, in so many ways, and that's true for any medium (film, clothing, comedy, etc.).  But when it comes to things we eat or drink, nothing can be more perplexing or surprising (and, let's face it...useless to you as a reader) than a restaurant review.  With movies, if you know the personality of the reviewer, you can probably guess how well they (and you) might like a film.  With food, it's often a complete coin toss.  And so it seems to be so far with Alvarez.\\n\\nYou see, I like Alvarez.  I didn't so much when I first moved to Boulder.  But seven years later, well, this is my go-to place.  Originally my fave was Juanita's.  And while Juanita's does fajitas and mole really well, overall I'm not as big a fan as I once was.  I've tried my damnedest to like Efrain's, another popular choice, but their food bores the life out of me so I've stopped trying.\\n\\nOne of the biggest reasons I like Alvarez is the inferno sauce.  Plus, this place will make pretty much anything you want as customized as you want.  We've tried...if you see something that sounds good, but you think to yourself \\"ooh, I bet that'd be good with XYZ instead of ABC,\\" they'll do it.  But the inferno sauce is a taste explosion that I've come to crave, so I usually end up just getting the inferno burrito (with a few mods, naturally).\\n\\nThey do other things competently, too, but it may take some time and experimentation (and even customization) for you to find the jewels on the menu.  Try as I might, though, I cannot remember if they do a good mole...my brain says no (a good mole is hard to find so I usually file that in the vault when I find one), but I honestly can't be sure.\\n\\nIt's ironically difficult to find good, flavorful Mexican food in Colorado, but Alvarez works for me.  It may not work for you.  My 4 stars are slightly generous perhaps due to my fondness for certain dishes here (some entrees are admittedly boring), but I can't think of many other Mexican places where they offer at least one thing that really gets my blood pumping."},{"name":"Deacon's Corner","address":"101 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Deacons Corner is a wonderful old school diner at the end of Main St. in Railtown.

Its versatile design lends itself to group meals, family outings, after work time at the bar, pleasant outdoor dining, and romantic dinners for two--quite an accomplishment all in one space.\\n\\nBut now the food and service live up to the environment. New additions such as a cheese platter of mostly French cheeses and a chocolate creme brulee dessert add an international flair, and there are also American offerings such as a buffalo chicken flatbread. But the focus is still on Italian food, with a variety of pastas and classic Italian entrees. The freshly baked bread was top notch, and we particularly enjoyed the antipasto salad, a creative combination of greens, prosciutto and olives.\\n\\nThe biggest improvement is the service. Our waiter, Anthony, was obviously very concerned that we have a great time, and we could see that to be the case with other tables and servers as well. The hands-on approach by management, who visited our table, is also a dramatic change.

I hesitantly ordered the Ancient Grains because I tend to be a picky eater and was scared how it would taste. When the food got to me, I was in awe. The plate was so beautifully organized and everything looked so fresh. After tasting the food I was in heaven. The sweet potatoes were just perfectly glazed and were not over powering. The hemp seeds were the perfect texture and complemented every bite. Every item in the bowl was so perfect and complementary to one another.

Aside from being a huge, wonderful store full of books and book-related merch, Powell's has two things I liked particularly: Shelves of subject categories contain both new and used books, and on level 4 is the rare books room, which opens at 11:00 a.m. You need to check in at the desk for passes, presumably to control the number of people in the room at one time. Aside from having a fascinating collection of rare volumes, all for sale, the store will ship your purchase for free--a great service, especially for the out-of-town visitor.

The food though was alright in my opinion.\\n\\nWe tried a couple different oysters, Island Creek and Wellfleet. Fresh and delicious! We got sliders, fried clams and fish & chips. The sliders which is what everyone says is a must try seems a bit underwhelming. There is more bun than flavor, but oysters are small so I get they cook down. I would say the fish is slightly better than the clams.

When she put an iced coffee on the counter I stepped forward thinking it was mine.  The girl clearly missed my order completely.  Another customer mentioned to her I'd been waiting a very long time.  Instead of just saying sorry and owning up to the oversight she just asked me what I got and made a really poorly mixed coffee.  Of course as luck would have it, I waited to take a sip until after I had gotten in my car.  She didn't put any carmel flavor in it as I had asked.
