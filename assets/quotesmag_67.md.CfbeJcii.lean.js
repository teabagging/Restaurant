You do NOT clear drinks off the table by stuffing one person's not-quite-empty glass in her neighbor's not-quite-empty glass so that you can remove both glasses with one hand. Our waiter did this twice. Also, watch out for those little red peppers and for anything such as a fish dish that we ordered that is spicy and has vinegar. I happened to be the first at our table to serve myself from it and lived to regret it, having a big coughing fit, maybe due to the hot vinegar volatiles or maybe it just went down the wrong way. The dish tasted just fine when I finally recovered.\\nThe Baldwin House, rebuilt in its present form in 1803, is a lovely 3-story Federalist which on the outside has been somewhat lightly \\"restaurantized\\" by placing neon signs in a few of the 3rd story windows and hanging 2 Chinese lanterns on the front portico.

The flavor in this was very unique and different compared to other tsukemen that I've had. It's worth the try but I have to say that I prefer regular tsukemen. The noodles and the dipping sauce is very flavorful. They give you a good amount of cha siu pork. While it's not a thick 2-3 piece slice, it was cooked and cut up. The noodles were interesting. It was flat and not as thick as other noodles that I've had with ramen but it was cooked well. \\n\\nYuzu Shio ($14) - My boyfriend ordered this and I have to say the broth in this was very flavorful. The cha siu pork was very tender. I wish I had this piece in my bowl instead of the cut up pieces that I had received in my bowl. \\n\\nButa Gyoza ($10) - Nothing too special about the dumplings in my opinion. Given the restaurant name of \\"Afuri ramen and dumpling\\" my boyfriend felt the need to order dumplings to try them. We probably would've been fine without them.\\n\\nSake Flight ($20) - They offer three different types of sake flight. We got the nectar harvest. Given the price, we thought the flight would be a bit bigger. The cups itself looked like it would have a decent amount but we were fooled at the neck of the cups as they were not hollow. So it wasn't filled up as much as we had thought. If it had been, I think we would've felt like we had gotten our money worth. Based on it, we may have been better off getting a bottle or something. \\n\\nOverall - This place is worth a try based on their different flavor and items they have on the menu for their ramen. Next time, I'd have to try their other location that has a full menu thats more like izakaya. While the ramen wasn't the greatest I had, it was definitely worth the try.

I'm interested in the hockey game so I get there at 8:00pm knowing I'll be alone. I didn't realize I'd be the only one at the bar who didn't work there. No worries, of course, I really just wanted to watch the game until they got there, so it was win-win. The nice, young, cute black girl (not trying to be racist, just trying to discern between the bartenders - this becomes more important in a moment) serves me a PBR, and the guy from upstairs who runs the comedy club offers to put it on his tab. So far, so good. If the night ends here, I give this place four stars and I thank everyone there. \\n\\nThe night continues, of course. The place gets more packed, my friend and his friends arrive, it gets more boisterous. Not a problem, right? It's a bar, right? Okay, so the night continues.\\n\\nVancouver scores. I cheer. Sue me, I don't like the Bruins. Different story for a different time. Didn't think that would be an issue. So we're looking a 1-0 in the 3rd period. The place is pretty quiet, and I'm just talking to my buddy about this and that, as his buddy puts a beer on the side of the bar. I move my right arm and accidentally knock it off the bar. I look over and say \\"my bad, I'll buy you another\\" (there's not person in the world this hasn't happened to). The bartender (\\"Patrick,\\" in this bizarre pink/flowered shirt) says \\"okay, you gotta go.\\" I honestly thought he was joking for a second. He summons the bouncer who says \\"you gotta go.\\" I look around like \\"serious??? For what, exactly?\\" Patrick says \\"that, and, I thought I heard you tell someone to 'fuck off' over here.\\" (This of course never happened, and of course he couldn't produce anyone who had heard me say anything anywhere near that - why would I? For the majority of the time I was there, there were less than five people in the bar!). So I sign out my tab and I leave. Mind you, my tab was, get this, $7.50, and I bought a beer for my buddy, meaning I had two beers, so I clearly wasn't drunk. This bartender was just a douchebag. Was he upset I was routing against his beloved Bruins (which is the fourth sports team in Boston anyhow)? Was he upset I accidentally knocked a glass off the bar? I would have gladly paid for it. But I have never, NEVER, been kicked out of a bar in my entire life, not in college, not afterward, not ever. I'm 29 years old, I don't drink nearly enough to get escorted out of anywhere.

The host and waitress were friendly (as everyone seems to be in the Disney resort/Boardwalk area). \\n\\nThe complimentary bread was good and I was happy that they knew enough to serve it with butter that was easily spreadable.

The noodles were cooked perfectly and the flavor was good - especially the bechamel. Nom. The cinnamon stewed chicken was interesting, but I wouldn't order it again. The mini lamb burger was good, as expected, but nothing special. \\n\\nThe hubs ordered the flank steak which came with potatoes and his plate was clean after all was said and done. \\n\\nThough we were satisfied with the portions, we still felt that the loukoumades (greek donuts with honey) were calling our names. They had a nice outer \\"shell\\" and the honey flavor was good. They came with two dipping sauces, one a cream, and the other was a tart raspberry. The raspberry was the way to go. Sweet and tart - can't beat it. \\n\\nWhile I wasn't blown away by the dishes, they were definitely good and worth a stop if you're staying at any of the Disney resorts near Epcot. In fact, we stopped in again the next morning to check out the breakfast. \\n\\nMy French toast was standard, but good.

My friend Greg was in town so I had to take him. We walked in at 8:14 our reservation was 8:15. The skies had just opened and everyone had come inside so they needed a few minutes to seat us. This wasn't a problem because I noticed Brent behind the bar. He ran the bar at Ecco so I knew we would be in good hands. Brent is a mixologist that knows how to blend the right amount of spice to start the taste buds. Tonight we get a jalapeno infused vodka and a agave wine spritzer with a garnish of spicy peppers and cucumber. As we sip and wait for our table I notice Chef Steven Satterfield friend from high school founding chef at Watershed and owner of Miller Union. That is a great sign. I say hey and we catch up for a minute. Jennifer the GM comes to talk to us and apologize for the delay. She takes time to talk over the menu with us. We arrive at our table and get 3 of each oyster offered. The beau soleil from new brunswick, cockenoe, and the wianno from cape cod. They came with horseradish and shochu mignonette. We followed that with the seared scallop crudo. It was simple and great. The green sauce had little dabs of horseradish and I highly suggest swirling the scallop through. We have finished our drinks and order a bottle of the Argyle pinot noir. It's a perfect red wine for seafood. The second round of food was started with the oyster sliders. The remoulade sauce was the right spice and the watercress help balance the flavor of the fried oysters. Then the grilled octopus and pork lettuce wraps are a do it yourself dish where you build the wrap with fresh herbs cold noodles and a spicy vietnamese sauce. The flavor was well matched with the wine. We ended with a tom yum shrimp bisque. The flavor was spot on. The base of the soup left hints of lemon grass and fish sauce, pure thai. The only regret was I wanted more than one shrimp. The final dish was the seafood sausage cassoulette done with white beans and braised squid with a tomato and fennel salad. The seafood sausage was tender and sweet. It was a great end to a great meal. We didn't have a sizeable serving off the menu which is their main entrees. But, we didn't miss it. The tastings were the way to go. We really got to sample a lot of food the staff was great. Ask for Dean our waiter. He was on it all night! We will be going back. Hats off to you Fifth Group you have done it again!!"},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My favorite real sushi in Atx!

My only complaint is I wish they had a few cheaper 1 oz pours or a sampling of 3 top picks. For food... we tried multiple things. The Big Board was great! HUGE selection of meats and cheeses and extras. 6 of us were able to enjoy it!  We also tried the meatballs and the polenta was so yummy and cheesy! The Mac n cheese bites were also good! We had the chimichurri steak for our meal and 4 of us split it. It was so tender and cooked perfectly! There were NO complaints at the table regarding the food... just happy faces and bellies! We also sat outside and could hear the live music which was a nice bonus.   Also, our kids were able to be entertained by the music so that was a plus!

The waiter, Joshua, arrived and from the get go was pretentious and rude. The way they get you here, is by saying \\"small dishes to share\\", and BOY do they mean small. Their so called \\"most known for dish\\" is literally just a tiny dollup of noodles with pepper and cheese, for $16. I can buy all of the ingredients for that for $16 and make a big batch of it to last me for weeks. Everything was over priced, and way too salty. I've had better bluefin tuna sashimi from HEB. We were frequently pushed by our waiter multiple times to order, and then ignored by their expensive Dim Sum tray because, as Joshua said very pointedly when we asked about it, \\"oh it's because you haven't ordered enough yet\\". And then he left, not allowing us to actually order. He came back, we ordered, finally got the dim sum. When checking on us, we tried to have a good conversation about some dish items, and he actually cut us off and said \\"ok anything else?\\", and then abruptly left our table. I've never wanted to wrap up a meal quicker. \\n\\nLong story short, you're better off going to get pizza next door at Via 313 and getting a craft beer. I won't be returning, and I've already told basically my entire company, friends, and family not to go. \\n\\nSome suggestions: lay back on the pretentiousness, this isn't Perry's steakhouse.

We went to the winter springs location. I have heard good reviews of this place from a friend, and read the descriptions of each roll on the site before deciding to go here. Ugh...I wish I stuck with our usual sushi places. This place is one in which I won't go back. The ambiance of the place is really pretty, but the food was just bleh. \\n\\nOne of the main problems was the cut of the sashimi. It was a really thick piece...so one thick piece could be two pieces. Chewing it makes me sick to my stomach. And you had to chew alot. I have had better quality and cut with care and pride.\\n\\nOther than the sashimi, the rolls weren't that good. I got the lunch special with gold digger, and spider roll. We also got an additional roll, the fire mountain roll. The \\"crab\\" in the spider roll was so fried, my fiance said it could be just fried flour. The gold digger was nothing amazing to talk about as it was ground up tuna. The fire mountain roll was nothing amazing. It was topped with chopped Spicy raw tuna, white tuna, and salmon, and even with the five sauces given out with the dish, it didn't help. I really think the problem overall is that their fish isn't that amazing and fresh.   \\n\\nService was slow (even in the delivery of the ginger salad), as there was only 3 other parties within the whole restaurant and considering there was 3 sushi chefs behind the counter. I might add this was on saturday during their lunch time.\\n\\nOverall my impression of this place is not good.

We waited a couple minutes to be greeted, and my fianc√© (because he's a total goof) tried to make a joke with her...to which she rolled her eyes. When we were seated it took 10 minutes for a server to even acknowledge us and at least another 5 before she took our drink order. She told us she was sorry for the wait, that there were only 3 servers on the floor and that they were completely busy. Which was funny because there was hardly anyone in there, and there were multiple servers off to the side just chatting it up! We ended up receiving our appetizer and nearly finishing it before we received our beers. And when we DID get those beers, they were sweaty and halfway to room temperature as if they had been sitting at the bar for a while. When we received our food, my fiance's wings were lukewarm at best. Our server didn't stop by to ask if everything was fine until she came and dropped off the check so we couldn't say anything about the wings.\\n\\nJust... Very disappointing.

I drive past this place pretty frequently, and I had never stopped in the morning until today.  I am in search of decent, convenient, and reasonably priced breakfast tacos on the run, so I gave in to my curiosity today.  The breakfast tacos are served out of a sawed off blue school bus booth, which is a nice touch.  I had no trouble parking in the lot right in front of the restaurant, but I could see how parking could be problematic on a busy day.  I pulled in, walked up, ordered two tacos: one migas and one potato, egg, and cheese, paid $3, including tax and was on my way.  I think the tacos run $1.39 for the standard menu items, plus tax, which in my mind is a pretty darn good deal.  They had the standard red salsa, it was good, but nothing to write home about.  The migas taco was good and tasty, but the potato, egg, and cheese was less impressive.  I am kind of a breakfast taco snob (favorites being Texas Honey Ham and Taco Shack), but I would stop back here because of the convenience, lack of wait time, and the price.  A solid choice if you happen to pass by here on your way to work.  If only someone would open a decent breakfast taco drive thru in Westlake or Downtown, I'd be in hog heaven.

It's easier to review things one element at a time so here goes my first review!\\n\\nAtmosphere: 5/5 I love the atmosphere in this place! On warm days they open up the sliding glass doors on the front of the cafe and let a nice breeze waft in. They have a fantastic rotation of local art, and it's always a treat to see what's new there; some of the staff also show their art there. There is a great old school photo booth that is fun to use even though the seat is tiny. And they have pool tables!!! Super cool! I also like that there are a wide variety of seating options because it's a spacious place. \\n\\nService: 4/5 Their service is great. The staff are friendly but normally a little rushed because there is usually a line so I always feel bad if I take too much time ordering; but that might be on me and not on them. They are happy to tell you about the food if you have questions and every time I have ordered they have gotten the food done within 10 minutes--making it a great place to stop by in the morning before work. They don't make with idle chit chat and are very prompt.\\n\\nCoffee: 5/5 They have excellent coffee! I have tried several different roasts and the beans are never burned, the coffee always tastes like it was just brewed and it's just high quality coffee. I have never gotten a drink there that tasted like it sat around for too long. Even their decaf is very flavorful, which a lot of places can't do well. I don't normally get espresso drinks, just regular drip coffee suits me fine so that's all I can speak to about their coffee.\\n\\nTea: 2/5 This is my one real complaint about this place is their tea. It isn't terrible, it's not like they're serving Lipton's or anything---most of it is Mem's brand tea which I normally like but they can't seem to get the tea to water ratio right. Normally the hot tea I have gotten there is either not very flavorful (it could be older tea) or when I order green tea they put it in water that is too hot and scalds the leaves which creates that astringent flavor (bitter, tangy harshness).  I do really appreciate that they have loose leaf tea though, and they give you a cup and saucer so you can remove the teabag when it's done steeping. The credit really goes to their iced teas, they are worth a try. Especially if you go in on a day that they have their iced Russian Caravan black tea--om nom nom! Get it with a wedge of lemon and feel refreshed!\\n\\nFood: 4/5 Their food is normally very good. I especially like their breakfast sandwiches on bagels. Their bagel selection is AMAZING! However there have been several times when I've gotten food back that was a little burnt. The garlic on a garlic bagel was so black and crispy I had to ask for a new sandwich. And the tofu breakfast scrambe (which is amazing by the way and you need to try it right now!) also is sometimes a little burnt on one side. All the pastries I've had there have also been very good-- their mint brownies and peanut butter brownies are like biting into a chocolately little square of heaven. But beware of the blueberry muffins there.....maybe I just got a bad muffin that day but it was dry and not flavorful at all, there were hardly any blueberries in it and the ones in there were also somehow dry....\\n\\nOver all, I would highly recommend it to anyone in the area. It's a great vibe, the people are friendly, the place is just really cool and they have great coffee!

From my first trip, I can highly recommend the kasuzuke; not too sweet, and just a hint of miso if I'm not mistaken.  The karaage was a fine example, and if you are feeling adventurous, you can try some of their marinated konnyaku.\\n\\nOverall this is a great place and not too expensive.

Both of us like the potatoes and carrots so we got a family size so there would be plenty left for Delilah (pet pig) skip forward a few hours and were pulling a nice golden brown pie out of the oven for dinner.  dig in to scoop out a couple pieces and no carrots or potatoes. We were both sorta disappointed so I gave them a call and let her know she gave us the wrong one and she told me how the one ingot was $1 more so it was like I got a bonus for free. Really? Thanks but it's not what I wanted or ordered so ....  She agrees I would get a replacement pie and the next day I get a call asking if I want to pick it up or have them send me a gift certificate I chose gift certificate since I figured it would be here in a day or two skip forward two weeks nothing has come in the mail and the wify has been upset since the day I told them to send it cuz she apparently wanted it that night so I give them a call and now \\"the manger\\" answers and tells me there no record of it and she would need to talk to her boss because according to her I wouldn't believe the amount of people that complain to get a free pie. So eventually after needing to call back again I was told they would give me a smaller pie since they can't verify my information.

I must say that the last three times or so have not been great. My last visit this Valentines Day was most likely my last visit. It all began by pulling up to the restaurant where I was accustomed to see a Valet person to take our car for $6.  A few minutes went by and no one came out. Then I noticed a sign in the sidewalk that read; Free self parking. See hostess for parking tag. Valet service $25.  I asked my girlfriend to go inside and find out what was going on. She was asked to leave a drivers license and she could get a parking tag. We proceeded to go that route since I was unwilling to pay $25 for this service. Once seated at the table, Our waiter was wonderful and began by explaining to us that the restaurant is under new management and that the menu had changed a bit but the goal was to make it more authentic. As I glanced through the menu, I did see some of the old dishes and some that must be new since I did not recall them. After ordering some wine and placing our order, the first tapa dish arrived at the table. I asked the waiter where the bread was. He told me that bread now had to be requested in order to get it. Really? The Solomillo de Ternera came out and not very flavorful. This came out just as a small piece of plain steak on a dish. I believe in the old style, it came with some mushrooms and a bit of sauce which was terrific. The Gambas and Pulpo were just ok. Honestly, most of our 10-11 dishes were just ok. It took me just short of an hour to drive 7.5 miles to get to this place on a busy night and right from the start, it did not get any better. Once we were ready to leave, we had to walk down to the car, get the parking tag and return back to the restaurant to get our license back.

I will say, though, that the Sangria, which our waiter said is made fresh in-house, was delicious.

Potatoes are good with lemon.  They play hockey games on TV and sometimes have live music.  The side of the place opens to the street so it can have a patio like feel with lots of natural light, which is nice.  It's basic but if you play your hand right, you can win here.

From the Magical Dining menu I started with the house salad, which was a great portion and had tasty balsamic vinaigrette dressing. For the main course I had the 8oz filet and it was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  One of the best filet's I have enjoyed in a long time.  They have a generous portion of mashed potatoes and green beans, unlike some of the other high end steak houses on the magical dining list.  For dessert, I had the banana bread pudding and it was a perfect sweet dish to complement my savory steak. My wife had the cheesecake and it was to die for!  You will not be disappointed here!  One other note, I noticed some people on here complaining about the green beans being undercooked.  These diners obviously don't recognize that green beans properly cooked should be a bit crunchy.  These aren't canned green beans LOL."},{"name":"New China Pearl","address":"288 Mishawum Rd","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"This is a really good dim sum place.

Even before getting to the food, I was already impressed by the thought the restaurateur has put in.\\n\\nThe decor is country homely. It's a small restaurant, but they have utilized the space well and even at full capacity, you wouldn't feel cramped - very pleasant. There are wall hooks for hanging up your jackets - a considerate touch. The menu is well designed and like reading a thesis - there is an executive summary, and more detail in the subsequent pages if you wish to read. \\n\\nUpon given the menu, the server informed us that they have ran out of Japanese leek, which would be replaced by bean sprouts. Apologies were offered.   \\n\\nI decided on ordering their most unique dish - Charcoal Dark Miso Ramen. It came beautifully presented on a tray complete with a fresh flower (purely decorative of course). Verdict upon the first slurp of broth? Light and not intensely miso-y. Not sure where the charcoal comes in other than the darkness of the broth. I enjoyed it nonetheless, but not something I'd be rushing back for. The noodles were perfectly chewy. The rest of the toppings, including the huge piece of marbled pork, were top-notch and plentiful. \\n\\nThis restaurant is ran in true Japanese style - scrupulous about every detail. I enjoyed the atmosphere and little touches at Motomachi more than the food. Kudos for taking a ramen shop, which is essentially Japanese fast food, to the next level.\\n\\nCASH & DEBIT ONLY."},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Great spot for cheap eats.

Again, I was told the bagels are already toasted. I told the cashier there is no way that can be considered toasted and that cooked is different than toasted. I don't know what the hell she was talking about. It is a whole bagel, untoasted, sitting in their case. Fine. Skipped it. \\n\\nCame back the 2nd day and wanted a porcini mushroom risotto soup. I have a thing about food sitting out, hot case or not, so I asked for a fresh one. The guy had a little hesitation but ultimately said \\"Sure\\" and got me one. It was fantastic. It was rich with ingredients, piping hot and bordered on being stew like. A co-worker saw mine and decided to get one for dinner. However, she got hers from the hot case and when she opened it at her desk, it was mainly broth and very little mushroom and risotto. She was very disappointed. I stopped in on the third day of my work week and wanted some clam chowder. But again, I simply wanted a fresh cup. I went to the cashier who told me \\"Sure\\" I could have clam chowder but \\"directed\\" me to the hot case. I explained I would prefer a fresh one and was met with the comment \\"Well, but we have the hot case for a reasonnnnnn.\\"  Oh yeah, Attitude? OK then. That's fine. I didn't make a purchase and I will not be back. I will go back to SIP across the street who has fantastic soups and their friendly service matches their products unlike Pret. It's nice, if not uncomfortable, to have your presence celebrated when you walk in, but if I can't get something as basic as a fresh soup when all the kid has to do is turn around and ladle a scoop or two, the smiles and welcomes scream disingenuous.\\n\\nI don't really get the whole concept here. You have pretty good sounding sandwiches and invest in this beautiful large shop but don't make anything to order? If everything is meant to be to go, why even have a seating area? Seems you just want people to grab whatever and get the hell to stepping. But seriously. Soup that sits for a while in a container begins to absorb the taste of the container so there goes your fresh/organic theory and the buffalo chicken sandwich has marinara sauce, for whatever reason, which SURELY makes the bread soggy as it sits in the hot case etc. A friend was dying to try a sandwich but every one of them had something she didn't like be it mustard or peppers etc.  I know they are doing well now and that people are excited, but I predict the novelty is going to wear off fast.

If you are going to serve a Jack Daniels chicken sandwhich, wouldn't you marinate it in the sauce a little before cooking it.  I am no chef, but wouldn't that make it taste better.  Instead of taking a half-assed approach of putting the sauce in a little pee cup.  Wouldn't you try to compete with chili's across the street or the 99 in Lynnfield, instead of waving the proverb French \\"I surrender flag\\" and give up on your business.  If this place did not have good servers, it would have just about nothing at all.  It was not that great years ago when I went here, and now it seems a little worse, like dying a really, really slow death.  I will be back to use up the last of my gift card, but I do not know about after that.  Corporate should really send out a corporate spy to this place to see what is going on and try to fix it Jon Taffer style.  The place could use a little bit of a makeover not to mention how they do business around here.  Some things this branch cannot change due to corporate management, but there are so many easy fixes around here."},{"name":"Raci√≥n","address":"1205 SW Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Creative, fresh, and definitely a bit leaving you for more....

But even with the discount, I've noticed the quality of food has gone steadily downhill in the past six months.\\n\\nDuring my last visit to Shanghai Elan, we ordered xiaolongbao, stir fried nian gao, pan fried crispy pork soup bun, noodles, and a couple of other sides. These dishes are standard fare at a Shanghai restaurant, comparable to fettuccine with marinara at an Italian place or chicken fried steak in Houston. Unfortunately, each one these Shanghainese dishes came out either barely warm, too salty, or not flavorful enough. This was the second time I had encountered such average quality food from Elan. I asked the floor manager what had happened and she confirmed what I had suspected... one of the head chefs had left and the sous chef was now in charge. She offered us pan fried red bean cake for dessert, but the damage was done.\\n\\nOverall, the restaurant is decent if you haven't tasted better and are not too picky about authentic Shanghainese food. The plating is good. Service is relatively attentive for a Chinese restaurant. They accept credit cards.

The sushi lunch special, $15, included four pieces of nigiri and a California roll, in addition to Miso soup and a salad.  \\n\\nThe salad was lettuce with soggy tomatoes and crisp cucumbers with miso ginger dressing; it was mediocre, but the dressing was good.  The miso was pretty standard; nothing to complain about or to write home about, other than the slightly larger than normal bowl.\\n\\nThe California roll was crisped, as if it had been pan seared for a moment (and perhaps it was), which actually made it slightly crunchy and very good.

A worn interior is one thing but a sticky table and messy dining room leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nThere are many choice of sauces and various combinations of wings. The menu has some sandwiches and what not. But I was there for these famous wings of 20 years. Or is it the chicken is 20 years old? The wings themselves are rather small and tiny, non breaded and deep fried, then tossed in sauce. Rock hard skin, flecks of flesh and bone are not really what I expected. Wasn't this place voted the \\"Best Wings\\" with raging reviews all across the board. Oh my, am I going to be the only one who does not think this wing deserves any title at all? We had the Honey BBQ sauce, which could have been off the Walmart shelf and this famously over emphasized Lemon Pepper sauce that everyone including the server is bragging about. Lemon Pepper? Where was the Lemon, where was the Pepper? More like tiny wings flapping around in a pound of butter.  The rack of ribs was fall off the bone tender, but the excitement stopped there. Nothing further.\\n\\nI was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, being voted \\"Best Wings by the Orlando Sentinel\\" and all.

The very front of this large cafe looks and feels exactly like any other coffee shop with its large windows, black thick-framed mac users and coffee aroma assaulting the senses.\\n\\nThe mid-section of this awkwardly shaped cafe brags a set of billiards and several booths that remind me of a classic road-side diner.  The back section resumes its cafe decor with small circular and larger square booths.  Another unique aspect of DC, is its long family style table with vaulted flooring booth like seating, and bar-style table facing the wall.  Adding to my curiosity was the loft above with two desks with several individuals seated working at their computers.  Whether this was public or employee space I may never know.\\n\\nThe pricing was about what you'd expect to pay, and the baristas greeted me before I had even a chance to glance at their lengthy menu of assorted drinks.  You pay for wireless, which I have learned seems to be a staple of any well managed coffee shop despite the inexpensiveness it poses in reality.

Your wine tasting is from machines that dispense the wine. There is no wine expert that describes the wines and is available to answer your questions. Moreover, the wine dispensers did not work. All evening long employees were doing their best two-step trying to get the machines to dispense wine. In addition, the place was soooo loud.... a terrible place for business conversations. Finally, there were other professional functions going on this evening. But, there was no delineation between one function and the other. So, I sat down and ate four pieces of cheese at a table adjacent to our function. Some a-hole approached me and asked me if I was a guest of UHY Advisors. He admonished me for eating four pieces of their cheese. The management of Vino Venue made no effort to separate one party from another, so there was no way that I could have known that I was nibbling at a separate function.

I love the grilled burritos (I can't bring myself to call them \\"quesadillas\\" except when ordering there) as well as the regular ones.\\n\\nFillings on offer include chicken, steak, carnitas, or spicy chicken, pork, and beef -- the spicy versions are truly spicy.

They offer a choice of cilantro-lime rice (my favorite) or typical Mexican-restaurant rice and black or pinto beans.\\n\\nTheir pico de gallo (salsa) is freshly made, authentic, and delicious, as is their corn salsa and guacamole. In addition to the usual sour cream, they also offer a chipotle crema that is delicious (although quite spicy). They recently added delicious fried plantains to their menu, and they've got a wide assortment of Mexican sodas and horchata as well as the usual American soda varieties.\\n\\nThey serve far more than burritos, but the burritos (and \\"quesadillas\\") are SO delicious that I can't resist ordering them to try their tacos and other offerings.\\n\\nTheir prices are fabulous, and best of all, they DELIVER, with the food arriving fresh and hot every time.\\n\\nLos Amigos isn't a place to eat in during busy times, as they only have a few seats at a counter; I hope they get permission to add some seats outside. And the staff have always been very pleasant and helpful to me. It's a small place with a small staff making everything fresh to order, so you may have a bit of a wait when it's busy. A good tip is that if you plan to order something that takes a while to cook (for example, the plantains), you can go directly to the register and tell them so they can get started with the longer-cooking items while you're still waiting in line.\\n\\nLos Amigos is not a splashy gourmet, full-service restaurant, but it's the best Mexican take-out joint in Boston, in my experience -- even better than Anna's and Philippe's, with a broader menu and fresher ingredients to boot."},{"name":"Dante's","address":"350 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Strange place...don't bring your mum...not quite hell though....pretty good music venue....if you are looking for hell in Portland, trust me, you will find it.\\n\\nNice arcade area if you are into that sort of thing."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"We wanted to try this place for along time and opted to go here as we were torn between Toasted and a fave, Black Bean Deli.

At first I thought I should not be too hard on them because they have only been open a couple weeks, but there were definitely some things I believe just shouldn't happen even with a brand new restaurant. We had a 7:30 reservation. We arrived a couple minutes before and were told that all the tables inside were full and we'd have to sit outside in 50 degree windy weather. If you are going to force people who made a reservation to sit outside, then you need to let them know ahead of time that their reservation does not guarantee they will be inside. On this particular evening, with the colder temperatures I would never have made a reservation to sit outside. In my opinion outside seating should be for those that don't make resrvations. \\n\\nThe actual building is nice. They've done a great job with the decorating an lighting. They have a lot of outside seating, which will be nice in the spring, but horrible in the summer. \\n\\nOur waitress was incribly inexperienced. She had no idea about any of the wines we inquired about. They were out of 3 that we ordered. It took her over 20 minutes to bring us a bottle. We ordered appetizers right away. Our appetizers came out cold and lacking any flavor. We ordered the mussels and artichoke hearts, which were covered in too much batter. The waitress took our salad and entree order, didn't write anything down. Without clearing the menus or appetizer plates, she ran off immediately to go put our order in. I'm guessing it was because she didn't write down what any of us ordered. She came back a few minutes later to confirm the salads we ordered.\\n\\nTwo hours after we sat down our entrees came out. Our salads never made it. We canceled our salad orders when they put our entrees on the table. The waitress apologized for the salads not making it, and said the tickets were getting backed up. I've never worked in a restaurant, but it seems odd to me that the salad line is backed up, but not our entrees. A friend ordered the pork belly, and everyone at the table agreed it was delicious. Another friend ordered the fish, and said it was over cooked. I ordered the pesto pasta, and it was very bland. The food was disappointing. \\n\\nIt took a good 20 minutes to get our bill after we asked for it. I felt like most of the evening we were waiting on one thing or another.

I came here wanting a nice quick brunch/lunch with a view with my boyfriend. We were taken to a very large booth right away which was very hard to get into because it had big poles underneath. The table had not been cleaned, there was water across half of it  which the seater saw, and no one ever cleaned it up. We did feel a couple of drips and when we looked up a ceiling tile above us was missing and there was a pipe. Our server was chatting with another table and did not come to great us for at least 5-10 minutes. We ordered quickly and the food took forever. It looked like the cooks were the same people running the food. I ordered the banana pecan pancakes with a side of sausage patties. The pancake (only 1 for a short stack) was really good, but was missing the pecans. Our table never had silverware so she brought those when I asked when we got the food. She put the silverware and the syrup on the table by leaning over the back of the booth near my boyfriend and dropping them on the table. It was incredibly unprofessional and sloppy. When she came back with the check after we asked for it, I was halfway through my pancake and confirms there were no pecans. We asked about it and she seemed confused and thought they should be in the batter. So she brought me out a cup of pecans to put on top. The sausage patties were preformed, very greasy, and you could see they were cooked in a dirty flat top. There were little bits of black stuff (from dirty surface) on them and my plate.  My boyfriend had a rueben which was average, but his side was coleslaw and you could tell it had been sitting for a while since the purple from the cabbage was starting to turn the whole thing a purple like color. The one other thing that was really strange was there was a number, short code, posted in the restroom to text if it was out of something such as toilet paper or soap.

She desperately wanted me to try it, but I'm lazy and driving here seemed like a hassle.  She tried bringing us a to-go order, but they informed her that they don't do that.  So it didn't seem in the cards that I'd ever get off my ass and check it out.  Then one day when my mom and her partner were visiting, we decided to go on a Yuzu adventure -- I'm game when I'm being chauffeured.  \\n\\nHere is where we had some difficulty though.  As many people mentioned, there is absolutely no sign.  It was really dark and late when we got there and we were having a hard time finding where it might be.  We asked some neighboring businesses where Yuzu was but no one knew.  Turns out we were right across the street, but this place is so secret, even they didn't know!  One guy thought we must have meant Taishoken, which was the only ramen place he knew in Beaverton -- and seriously this guy was right across the street!  \\n\\nWe tried calling Yuzu but even though they were open, no one answered the phone, which seemed...  ... Bad.  My mom's partner was now convinced the place didn't exist or was out of business.  In the end, I had to call my friend and ask her where if was.  Yuzu is so popular that those who actually knew where it was were lined up outside.  Too bad we didn't notice that.  But these kinds of issues definitely make Yuzu not the most accessible restaurant.  I don't suppose they care much about that.\\n\\nOnce we finally were seated, we ordered a ridiculous amount of appetizers to try, including the fermented squid and tongue.  The waitress attempted to dissuade us from the fermented squid, but we persisted.  The appetizers, particularly the tender tongue, were quite good and my mother and I were very happy that we hadn't given up in our quest to find the elusive Yuzu.\\n\\nWe had the kakuni ramen (house special) which was delicious and homey.  We were a little disappointed because we hadn't realized that you had to order the egg in the ramen as an addition.  Aside from that though, we were in pork belly heaven.  \\n\\nThis was one of those rare restaurants where not a single thing we had ordered was a letdown.  Every appetizer was a small delight and the ramen itself was a hot, rich bowl of savory goodness that warmed our bellies.  It completely made up for the fact that we were obviously too inept to find the correct address for ages.\\n\\nOne last caveat though that makes Yuzu not for everyone is that my mom's partner is a vegetarian, and he found ordering fairly difficult.  When we finally arrived there after all the trials and tribulations and he scanned the menu getting more and more apprehensive that he might not be able to eat anything, he asked the server what on the menu was vegetarian.  \\"Not much,\\" was the reply.  He definitely had a less satisfactory dining experience than we.  But for those who enjoy tender, melting pork belly and soft slices of tongue, Yuzu is definitely worth the trek and the treasure hunt -- just look for the tiny darkened business in the strip mall with a horde of loyal ramen fans milling outside."},{"name":"Newtowne Variety","address":"93 Windsor St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"This place makes serious sandwiches.

Pretty cool but the table was really wide and the benches were set so far back as to be uncomfortable.  We got the seafood combo which came with 4 veggies.  We also had our choice fo broth to cook it in-spicy szechuan, tomato or meat.  We both got the spicy and my daughter got tomato.  All very flavorful. The portion were huge!  Three very large prawns, cuttlefish, two different types of fish balls and some other fish.  For my 4 veggies I got tofu, lotus, spinach and seaweed.  All was good but didn't love the big chunks of seaweed knots.  Hubby got some standard veggies and taro.  The taro was my favorite thing on the plate!  For an add on I got two eggs.  One I broke into the broth and it just kind of disappeared. the other I par boiled, peeled and then finished in the broth.  \\n\\nAll in all it was a pleasurable experience.  I would suggest training the servers to tell guests about how long to cook each item.  We were kind of on our own there.  We will definitely got back to check out the extensive sushi menu and the Korean all you can eat barbq option"},{"name":"Saz√≥n","address":"1816 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I don't know why I ever would have given Sazon less than 5 stars.

The restaurant space is very nice and open, I like the variety of table sizes and assortment of benches and chairs, some that reminded me of elementry school.  \\n\\nWhen you walk in, you place your order first and pay, then find a table to sit. Luckily, we came a little early for dinner and there wasn't a line or full tables. We ordered two dishes to share, Hawthorne Mac and Stir fry. For drinks I got the Spicy Stella and my friend got the Coconut Cider. \\n\\nDrinks were served first while we waited for our food and served in mason jars. VERY CUTE. The coconut cider was warm and like an apple cider with a nice flavor and spices. My friend said she enjoyed her drink.  My spicy stella was off the smoothie list and to be honest, I saw cayenne pepper in the ingredients, didn't read anything else and just blindly decided on it. Probably the best decision I made! I am so in love with this smoothie that I didn't even realize there was a strawberry banana combo involved and I HATE STRAWBERRY BANANA!! I also didn't even realize there was coconut milk in it and I'm not a big that that either... but it was so smooth and creamy, so flavorful and oh the kick from the cayenne just made my day! It was good to the last drop and I will be back for this smoothie!! \\n\\nHawthorne Mac was warm, not hot when it arrived at the table so that was a disappointment. I liked the bits of kale mixed into the dish and gives it some color. With the dish being vegan, the cheese used makes it look like processed American cheese so I wasn't a fan of the appearance but I did finish my plate, not sure if I would order this again.\\n\\nThe stir fry was a very colorful dish and \\"eat the rainbow\\" applies here.  Rice noodles could've been a little softer. I was not a huge fan of the pineapple ginger sauce, maybe there was too much and it was overwhelming but I don't feel that it mixed well with the veggies and rice noodles. It felt as if it the dish wanted to be pad thai but missed the mark completely.

We rented a zipcar on a Friday night and got there around 7:30. The restaurant is in the middle of the suburbs and so even though it was a Friday night, there was plenty of seating. We sat at the bar and were fully welcomed by Ran and his team. \\n\\nAlong with being super knowledgeable about cocktails, Ran is incredibly hospitable. I had glanced at the restaurant's website and had wanted to try this cocktail called \\"Nobody but you\\" which had cranberry shrub, blueberry infused gin, st. germane, and some chili to kick it up. The cocktail menu is continuously changing and so they weren't offering the cocktail anymore but if you name them a base spirit and a brief description of what kind of cocktail you're looking for, they'll whip something spectacular for you! The great thing about this bar is that they offer some very unique spirits including maple infused vermouth. When we were sitting at the bar, my boyfriend noticed another patron drinking a Hoppy Topper. I'm not as knowledgeable about beer as my bf is but apparently according to beer advocate and rate beer, it is one of the best beers in the world (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/27039/16814/?ba=bros) http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/alchemist-heady-topper/32329/ \\n\\nA regular customer drives up to Montreal once every 6 weeks and so on the way up, he'll usually pick up a few cases for Ran.

For beer snobs, the Hoppy Topper is similar to Bell's Hopslam Ale http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/287/17112\\n\\nFor food, we ordered from the Sichuan menu a fish dish and a chicken dish, two hot & sour soups, a bowl of rice, and some soup dumplings.

A couple of things.  First, you NEVER come to a Cantonese restaurant for the decor, or even for the friendly people, because you won't find any.  In fact, I think that most Chinese waiters to go Chinese Waiter School where they get their PhD in bad manners and brusk behavior, treating customers in a way where they won't want to come back again.  Such was certainly the case here.  But you don't go to a family Chinese restaurant for Four Star service or the ambiance, you go there for the food... period.  \\n\\nWhen I sat down, the place was bright and fairly busy.  I immediately received the usual, \\"Who are you and what are you doing here?\\" attitude from the less than cordial server, and I ordered up right away.  I was famished, coupled with the fact that this was the first place in ATL I found that featured fresh seafood, so I decided to give it a try.  First, I was rather shocked to learn that the prices were equal to that of the most expensive Chinese seafood joints in NYC.  The crab cost me $50., and a simple plate of sauteed Chinese greens was $14.00.  Even a pot of tea cost four bucks, usually supplied complimentary in any decent Chinese restaurant I've ever heard of.  The food was well prepared, but extremely high for the Atlanta area.  When I asked the decidedly unfriendly waitress for a towel to clean up with after eating an entire crab myself, she looked as though I was personally demanding a winning lottery ticket.  In any reputable Chinese seafood restaurant, a warm, moist towel is always offered after dinner, but evidently she had never even been inside a Chinese seafood restaurant.  Welcome to Atlanta.\\n\\nAll in all, the entire meal cost me eighty bucks, with the Uber ride, a cool hundred dollars for a meal out.

People always seem to complain about the parking in the Uptown area, well 8 State took care of that!  The owner wants Uptown to thrive, not just his restaurant, so offering valet is a nice touch.\\n\\nThe entree menu is kind of pricey so for us going there for dinner is reserved for special occasions.  But there are many other ways to enjoy the ambiance without spending a lot of money.  For example, we've been there for cocktails and shared a couple small plate items (highly recommend the pork cheeks and the calamari; it's like no calamari you've ever had, and it's gluten free, if that's important to you).  We've also had the flatbread and brussels sprouts: both awesome!\\n\\nThey also have a great Ohio Proud Happy Hour during the week which consists of cocktails made with Ohio-made alcohol for $6.  The Happy Hour also has great prices on Ohio craft beers, wine, martinis and small plate items.  Try the Chef's Special flatbread during Happy Hour.  The last time we were there it was a short rib flatbread with smoked cheddar and caramelized onions: SO GOOD!\\n\\nWhen we went for dinner I had the scallops (they were cooked perfectly and the pasta they were on was so tasty I couldn't shut up about it).  My husband had the rabbit strudel.  That's right: rabbit strudel!  That was also super good.  We're already talking about what we'll try next; I think I'm going to try the fried chicken and my husband is going to try the pork chop (we heard a lot of people around us talking about how great the pork chop is).\\n\\nUptown is a very special place, with a lot of history, and it is very obvious that the owner of 8 State wanted to preserve that history.  It was originally a theater and then Amish Originals; he brought the theater back to life with a grand entryway with vintage sconces and wallpaper, and theater curtains which lead you into the restaurant.  Old movies are projected onto the wall and the furniture is from Amish Originals, which is still Uptown just down the street.  It's great when local businesses shop from other local businesses; another reason 8 State Bistro is such a wonderful addition to the Uptown area.

The staff was friendly and attentive and I never saw an empty glass or plate sit for more than a few seconds before some efficient server came and scooped it up. \\n\\nDinner was one of the best meals I've had in some time - certainly the best I've EVER had at an event for so many people.

One of my favorite things that night were their adorable little asiago stuffed baby potatos. They also had a terrific selection of nice wines, Champagne and a well-stocked bar. \\n\\nOverall, I was really impressed with the space and the staff.

When someone told me I was living so close to a cookie factory in Milton, I swear my heart stopped for a few seconds.\\n\\nDisappointingly, the 'Factory' part of 'Bent's Cookie Factory' turns out to be a glorified word for deli/bakery, although at one time in history it was in fact a true factory. I admit the disappointment is my own fault because I arrived anticipating a tour and samples (Sam has spoiled me...) without having researched, but still!\\n\\nAlso, the cookies are not good. Mediocre at best. Not what you'd expect from a self-proclaimed 'Cookie Factory.'  My boyfriend and I sampled just about one of each offered, and they were all pretty dry and bland. Well, except the macaroons- they are delicious, and I've since been back for more.\\n\\nBent's sandwiches definitely redeem the place. I had a Big Blue and my boyfriend had an Apple and Brie sandwich, and both were good, but not anything too breathtaking. My only issue is that the 'baguette' is NOT baguette. Not crusty. Not dense. Not baguette. It's really a fluffy sub roll, which can really ruin a sandwich when you've anticipated it being served on baguette. In my mind, every great deli/bakery should have some sort of crusty bread, but Bent's doesn't, and that's borderline unacceptable for me. Silver lining: the sandwiches are wrapped in butcher paper!\\n\\nIn conclussion: Don't go out of your way to visit Bent's, but if you stop in on your way by, get a sandwich (that doesn't rely on crust bread for the full experience) and a macaroon, and you'll be happy."},{"name":"Great Harvest Bread Company - Boulder, Colorado","address":"2525 Arapahoe Ave, Unit A4","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"The bread excellent.

Had their pork belly. While it certainly had a good amount of fat to be deemed as pork belly, it wasn't as flavorful as I expected. Slightly on the sweet side, must've been glazed. When I envision Southern pork belly, I expected some kind of peppery/smoked hard core flavored belly but mehh...my preconceived notions was completely off. I blame Taiwanese pork belly to be too good hence my amped up expectation of SOUTHERN bellys. \\n\\nFor the cold scoop, I had their potato salad. The potato salad was hands down the best thing out of the entire dinner. I'm a fan of potato-related foods so perhaps I am biased. Not too much mayo put in it, similar to Japanese potato salad.\\n\\nAvoid the collard greens. Really didn't like it and the color and texture of it made me feel like I was eating big pieces of tea leaves. Bland, nothing special. Annnnd this is coming from a gal who usually loves her vegetables. \\n\\nIf you ever have the chance to sit outside, do so. Inside is too loud to carry much audible conversation. Lighting is decent and the summer weather adds to the relaxing atmosphere. \\n\\nThe drinks menu is extensive. The somewhat annoying thing is they give creative/wacky names to their alcohol selection but you can't figure out what flavors they're going for without asking the waiter. Best to let your server know what preferences you have if you have trouble figuring out what to get. \\n\\nI will have to give major kudos to Jacob, our waiter. He is one of the most enthusiastic waiters I've ever met. When asked about what he'd recommend for drinks, he promptly gave recs along with a very detailed description with smiles. Jacob, you were the only reason why I even ordered the collard greens because you made it sound so good pff.

Upon arrival we were told there was neither fried chicken nor a table that was ready for us. \\n\\nWhen we questioned the hostess about the lack of fried chicken on Fried Chicken Night, she and her colleague were less than pleasant about it.  We even suggested that management remove the rather large sign on Peachtree advertising Fried Chicken Night.  After further conversation they admitted this happened often.  Not really a selling point, ladies.  I then suggested that if this happened with regularity  management might need to consider better planning and the key to a successful theme night involves actually producing the theme - fried chicken.

I live all of maybe 3 blocks away, but the exterior seemed so cheesy to me, that I never really would've given it a chance.\\n\\nIt's beautiful inside... great for a date.  Ironically my first meal here was the last with someone I spent four years with off and on!  Put the Kleenex away - it was for the best, long distance thing.  I digress.

The first tip off that Sabitino's is pure awful was that it was empty when we went in at 1:15 in the afternoon.  About twenty five tables, all empty except ours.  The next tip which should have sent us scrambling for another lunch place is that they have two menus with two different sets of prices. \\n\\n     The menu they sent in the mail is two dollars cheaper for everything than the one in the restaurant.  When confronted with this fact the wait staff said the menu they mailed out is only for take out.  No  where did that menu say that it was for take out in fact a couple of coupon items did say they were only for take out implying that the rest of the menu is for the in-restaurant customer.  Talk about bait and switch.\\n\\n     When the food came the only word to describe the Lasagna is gross, totally uneatable when told that I would not eat a second bite the waitress did seem disapointed so I ordered french fries and they were fine but not much of a lunch.  An order of elbow macaroni in a watery \\"cream sauce\\" was almost as bad as the Lasagna.\\n\\n   Shortly after refusing to eat the disgusting looking Lasagna the cook arrived at the table with no apologies for food we would not eat but assured us he checked it and it \\"was good\\".

I will very happily be back to explore more of what they have to offer, especially since they offer reservations.\\n\\nWe started with the crostini with salmon rillette and whipped ricotta. They were lightly seasoned with well balanced flavors and, very surprisingly for this sort of thing, a generous portion - not the usual 1\\" diameter crostini but two large pieces. For the two of us these were a great appetizer. If you have more than two people my guess is you would want to order more than one appetizer / \\"bite\\". \\n\\nWe skipped a salad, deliberately intent on not over-ordering. Instead, next we had a pasta: the proscuitto ravioli with kohlrabi which were very savory and as with the previous course, a nice portion and an interesting dish. The kohlrabi was better prepared than I've experienced in other restaurants, very tender. After this was the main which we also shared: the king salmon with wax beans and figs which was a big hunk of fish, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. Last but not at all least we ordered the bombolone which were unbelievably good. In a city full of fried dough treat options, these were more crisp and light than what I have had elsewhere with fillings so good that we wanted to scrape every bit off the plate. If we were not sharing, having a pasta and a main would have been too much - splitting these between more than two, however, would mean ordering more. Portions are very nice but not huge.\\n\\nWhat really made the evening, was that the dining room was well staffed and the service was excellent. Our plates were cleared promptly, we never had to flag down a server to take care of our drinks - it was always done seamlessly and without interrupting our conversation, food was delivered with great timing and at the right temperature. The staff does a fantastic job of covering for each other and monitoring each table. I also thought it was great to have no extra charge for sharing plates!

Recently, I have been dining at the bar and enjoying the great bar specials ($5 drinks and similarly priced food options).  Last night I went to the bar with two friends in hopes of experiencing that same good service.  It was about 8:50 PM when we arrived and upon sitting at a bar table in the very empty bar, the bartender, Rachel, came up to us, said hello and then told us the restaurant closed at 10:00 PM. Even if we came in at 9:50 PM, we were in before the restaurant closed and that is all that should have mattered.  After reminding us of how long we had to eat, she took our drink order. I ordered a Sunset Cosmo ($5 bar special).  I have had this drink many times in the past and it has always been consistent in taste and pour.  Not only did this drink taste like it was mostly sodium free orange juice, it also tasted a bit watery.  On top of that, it was not even a full martini. It is interesting that every other bartender who has served me this drink managed to use the same recipe and measurements, until Rachel.  We ordered steaks for dinner which were very good, cooked perfectly.  My friend and I both ordered broccoli which was a huge mistake.  I usually get broccoli and it tastes fresh, this time it tasted sour and like it had been sitting in garbage.  Had Rachel stopped by our table to ask us how our meal was, she would have known.  I assume this was an oversight by the chef because it has never happened before...and should never happen again.  I finished my drink and was considering ordering another Sunset Cosmo but I feared it would turn out the same as the first one so I decided to go with the Steakhouse Gin Martini with a splash of cran ($5 bar special as well) and no olives.  Rachel brought over the shaker and poured it into the martini glass and it reached the halfway line.  I looked at her like she was stupid.  She proceeded to explain to me that the drink looked like there was less because when you add olives it increases the volume of the martini.  Now,  I have had many martinis in my time on this earth and I am not an idiot.  I have also ordered this very same drink from this very same restaurant and received a full martini pour.  I was tempted to try out her experiment and ask for the olives so I could see just how much volume olives would have added to my martini.  Instead, I asked her to add vermouth (which she forgot in the first place) and another splash of cran.  She grabbed the glass off the table with irritation and unnecessary attitude and and returned with the adjusted cocktail moments later.  She poured the martini from the shaker into the glass and walked away. The pour was less than my first drink and tasted watery again.  I was disgusted with the service and inconsistency at this point so I simply gave up.  We finished our food and she cleared our plates, full of spoiled broccoli. She gave us the bill without asking if we wanted dessert. We just wanted to leave.  \\n\\nAs someone who has worked in the food and beverage inudstry for 8 years, this was unacceptable.  Rachel had every opportunity to check on our table and see if our meals were to our liking as she walked past us many times.  She did not ask how our steaks were, if they were cooked to the desired temp, she did not ask how the drinks were, she did not ask if we wanted dessert.  It was made very clear from the minute we sat down that we had a limited amount of time to eat and drink, which was very rude. Yes, it is closer to closing time then it was when you started your shift but you are still open so do not treat your guests like they are messing up your opportunity to leave early, even if they are.  Just because your restaurant has $5 drinks does not mean you should only serve $2.50 worth.  It is on the menu for a reason. Perhaps your staff needs more training so everyone can be on the same page because it is extremely diasppointing to have a drink, and food, you like be made inconsistently."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My favorite Japanese restaurant in town.

A tap list of roughly 40 beers that appeared to favor the Pacific Northwest (rightly so) offered plenty of selection for even the snobbiest of beer snobs.\\n\\nWe hung out mainly on the patio during our stay at the Dragon which was nice and laid back and our server was very friendly and personable. The rest of the bar appeared real low-key and looked like a decent place to throw a few back.\\n\\nHowever, it wasn't the libations that inspired me to throw in my two cents for this joint - it was the burgers. To be more specific, the kobe bacon burger. I'm from the Midwest, where we take pride in eating nothing but food that takes minutes, if not hours, off of our deep-fried lives.  This was arguably one of the best burgers I've ever had. It's simplistic, but frickin' delicious and the wasabi mayo accompanying this bovine goodness was the icing on the cake. Yeah, it was 15 bucks for a burger, but it's worth every penny.The rest of the menu looked like respectable pub grub, but if I'm ever back they need only have one item on the menu to satisfy this guy."},{"name":"Toco Grill","address":"1658 Lavista Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I want another pita filled with falafel and other good stuff right now. RIGHT. NOW. I was so excited as soon as I walked in. There were a bunch of girls just standing around rather than sitting while waiting for their sandwich so that was kind of off-putting at first but then I was noticed and my pita was started! After agreeing to hummus, I was asked if I like things spicy. Oh yes I do. The guy behind the counter put a bit on the top piece of a pita he cut off and oh that actually burned with nothing else involved. I kept myself from coughing like a wimp but 10 minutes later in the car, it finally could not be stopped. Good stuff. \\nWhen my pita came out I was just sort of like overwhelmed by all the things to add. After realizing I looked completely confused as to where to start, I relinquished my pita to the guy behind the counter and let him do his thing. He wrapped it up to go for me and I tried to get home as fast as possible to stuff my face.\\nI open the bag and my pita doubled in size after I gave it to him. It was now full of pickles, cucumber and tomato, grilled eggplant, tahini. I squeaked and bit in immediately. The spicy sauce was way less noticeable with all the other goodies inside. I would definitely get just a tad bit more next time because I like a good kick. But everything all blended together was so good. \\nAs for the falafel itself, it was amazing, hands down the best I've ever had. They were nice and crisp on the outside, and fluffy on the inside.

I stick to lighter choices like the pechugo de pollo and veg, but I've tasted their burritos with cheese sauces that are huge and delish.  Always plenty to take home.

We had heard from many people that it's a great city with a reputation for amazing food. I'm happy to say that Vancouver lived up to its reputation.\\n\\nWe found out about the Cactus Club Cafe through a recommendation made by a hotel employee when we checked in at the Marriott in downtown. He said it was among his top 2 picks for restaurants in downtown. Little did we know that there are several locations in Vancouver. The one we ended up going to is right next to the Convention Center & Coal Harbor. The view is great- you are surrounded by the high rises of downtown on one side, & the water on the other. It was beautiful to see the sun go down, & see the lights of the city come on.\\n\\nThe service was great once we were seated, which was after waiting for about 1 hour. They said that a convention had just let out, & a bunch of people got there just before we did, which is why the wait was so long. Again, the service was great. We had a wonderful waitress who came by often, but never so much that it interrupted our conversation. She was friendly & made good recommendations.\\n\\nWHAT TO ORDER: \\n1. The Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns was absolutely delectable! They tasted fresh, & the rich creamy sauce perfectly complemented the delicate sweetness of the shrimp & the squash. \\n\\n2. The Double-Braised Pineapple Hoisin Short Rib was incredibly tender. It literally fell off the bone with the slightest touch of a fork. It was sweet, tangy, & full of flavor. The tasty mashed potatoes & peas gave it a \\"comfort food\\" quality.\\n\\n3. The Sangria \\"slushy\\" was like an adult version of a childhood treat. It's more of a cocktail than a traditional sangria, as it has some Bellini influence. That's not to say that it's not as good, because it is! You may even want to order a second one (we did)!\\n\\nWe had such a great time, & really enjoyed tasting unique dishes from a restaurant founded in Vancouver.

I've been in probably 4-5 times and tried to taste a bunch of different things, and I've always left feeling satisfied (although, typically, maybe a little too satisfied-- the food is heavy enough that it leaves you in a food coma even if you only eat half of what's on your plate).\\n\\nMy favorites are the brisket burnt ends and the pulled pork, although I've tried the fried chicken and loved the crispy, well-seasoned breading on that, too.  But the sides, for me, steal the show!  The broccoli and cheese casserole is super rich and delicious, and the potato salad is dill-y and wonderful.  I also loved the farm salad, even though I was worried that ordering a salad when there were so many decadent options would be a waste; it was actually one of my favorite things that I tried!\\n\\nI'd skip the mac and cheese and the collard greens, which are fine but nowhere near as good as some of the other sides.  And while I enjoyed my ribs, some of my family members found theirs dry (I think because we're used to sauce-covered ribs as opposed to these, which are dry-rubbed-- you can add your own sauce at the table if you so choose).\\n\\nThe service is friendly, and the decor is cute and welcoming.  The chef/owner stopped by our table one of the times we visited to see how our meal was, which I really appreciated!  Make sure to go at an off-peak time or be willing to wait a bit to be seated; I've called ahead to ask when a good time to come in is, and the staff has never steered me wrong.\\n\\nOh, and GET THE BISCUITS!  Yum.\\n\\nP.S. I will add that I've been to gatherings where friends have ordered the catering/take-out platters, and the food was nowhere near as good as it is in the restaurant.

Visiting here did not disappoint.  Before I get into the reasons why I loved it, I do want to throw one thing out there...  The service was awful.  While our waitress was knowledgable about the menu and polite to deal with, she was slow, not attentive, and our overall dining experience probably lasted an hour longer than it needed to.  I would not suggest Sweet Cheeks if you are in a rush.  Okay, now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'm going to rave about it now.\\n\\nThe food was really tasty.  I've obviously heard how they are known for their biscuits and let me tell you, THEY WERE HEAVENLY.  It was hands down the biscuit dreams are made of--perfectly flaky, rich and satisfying.  Plus, the honey butter it came with was top notch as well.  Our table went for a bucket of biscuits which was great as it meant a biscuit for each of us.  Awesome!\\n\\nAs far as food goes, I honestly wanted one of everything.  Price was a little up there but I figured since I was traveling, I needed to go with an option that allowed me to taste as much as possible.  A platter it was!  I had so much trouble deciding what meat to get I asked our server what she loves and she suggested the pork belly so I went with that.  A platter includes a hot and cold side as well so I settled for potato salad and broccoli casserole.  All excellent choices.  The pork was fatty, rich, moist and perfectly tender.  It was fun tasting the different BBQ sauces too.  They have three homemade ones they leave on the table for you to use!  The potato salad was tasty, but I've had better and the broccoli casserole was so wonderful.  It was topped with ritz crackers which is obviously a southern classic!\\n\\nNow libations.  They have a whole list of specialty craft cocktails.  I went for a tequila habenro cocktail.  Boy was it spicy.  Refreshing but spicy.  I can't decide if it was too spicy or not but I definitely enjoyed the tequila and the heat balanced out by sweet citrus notes.\\n\\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU EAT HERE.

They even gave me a little extra soup since they knew I loved it.  I brought it home thinking I would just take a bite of each sandwich and save it for lunch the next day, but much to my amaze the sandwiches tasted so damn good I ate about half of each.  That mayo they give you (it was on the side - kudos for that) was excellent.  The turkey burger size was smaller than I'd like, but it was full of flavor.  And the whole wheat bun also tasted great - - even the next day too!  It kept very well, which doesn't happen that often when it comes to burgers and leftovers.  \\n\\nService was spot-on excellent, very nice and professional.

We came in around 6pm and the place was already packed (it was just after Christmas.)  Their diners were a nice mix of families (with kids), well dressed millenials, touristy types and, bros hanging out at the bar watching the hockey game. The hostesses were very friendly and luckily we got a table within 15 minutes.  It was really dark in there and I felt like I was dark dining. We had to whip out our cell phones to read the menus as there was only one tiny candle on our table -- we weren't the only ones using our mobiles to read the menus.\\n\\nWe had a round of \\"The Cohiba\\" to start us of and it was a fresh tasting cocktail with fresh blackberries.  It was a nice respite from walking around in the cold wet rain. (We had 2 rounds!)  Then we shared the Tuna stack and Calamari.  The tuna was a bit watery so it didn't taste like much to me.  The accompanying wonton crackers were very crispy and delicious on its own.  I did eat it with the tuna but it barely improved it. The calamari was tiny but plentiful, and was very crispy and cooked well (not rubbery).  I preferred the spicy and slightly smoky chipotle aioli to the thin overly-dilled tzatziki.\\n\\nI really wanted the duck confit but sadly they ran out (by 6pm?!) so I chose the Hunter Chicken instead.  There was a long wait for our mains after the appy dishes were cleared.  The chicken was dry and didn't taste like much.  I had to slather it in the demi glace but I found the sauce a bit too salty so needless to say, I didn't eat much of the chicken.  The mushrooms were good and meaty but will not compensate for the over cooked protein. \\n\\nI wish my meal was better than it was as I was starving after our show.

The hotel is great!  This restaurant is nice, has some flaws. \\n\\nAmbiance: I sat in a booth in the back to the left.  I wanted to clear up some emails while I had breakfast.  Usually quite, but not today.  I don't remember the center tables in my past stays, but one group sitting close to the street windows in these tables were talking in normal voice, but the sound carried all the way to back.  Restaurant used to be intimate but not no more.\\n\\nFood:.  I had to be at work at 7am, so could not eat at the restaurant first two days since the restaurant opens at 6:30am.  Looking for a hearty breakfast on my departure day, I decided to give it a try.  Menu seems appealing with standard fare items (no hash browns, only breakfast potatoes; probably easier to open a bag, reheat and scoop and serve than to shred and cook hash browns).  Ordered biscuits and gravy.  Biscuits were packaged off the shelf English muffins that had burnt ends from the toaster.   Gravy was obviously not prepared fresh.  It tasted like it had been pulled from the fridge and reheated poorly; cool lumps throughout. They sprinkled some green herbs on top that added no flavor.  Side bacon was nothing special, thin and flavorless.  I was expecting thick apple wood type smoked bacon for the $5 they charged for 4 little pieces.  Glass of OJ was ok, but $5 is too much for the small glass.\\n\\nService:. Restaurant was empty, but it still took 10 mins for the server to acknowledge me.  I asked her what she recommended.  She did not have an opinion.  Food came out about 5 mins after I ordered.  Confirms my suspicion that food is not freshly prepared, but prepared before, comes in a food service bag and is just reheated?  About halfway through eating she said she was going on break; she left the check.  Did not see anyone again until asked another server for water refill and the check.\\n\\nValue:. $25 for mediocre English muffins, coffee, OJ and bacon.  $30 with tip.  I had a breakfast coupon that gave me $8 of relief.  But the meal was not worth the $22 I paid with tip.  \\n\\nBottom line:. There are many other options in the general area for breakfast.

The very first thing I tried to order was a Mac n jac beer, I was told you were out so I moved on to another choice. When I got my beer the glass was dirty so I opted to drink from the bottle.

The first thing to come out was some Irish nachos, we had to ask for napkins and silverware, out of the 6 of us nobody cares for the nachos...so we moved on to the pizzas, they gave us 3 individuals to substitute for a large. The pizza was alright...I noticed at one point, someone who I thought looked like the manager standing at a table with what appeared to be his girlfriend hugging on him and he was eating food off their table.

When we arrived, there was no hostess waiting, no sign directing us, and an outright mob of people inside. We pressed through to the bar, where a waitress caught us and said she'd find us a table. \\n\\nOrdered a couple of pints at the bar and got some seats on a wicker chair and a re-cushioned church pew next to possibly the most self-important man in the room and waited about 15-20 minutes before we were even able to catch our waitress. She had waited on the table across from us at least 3 times, and we had been passed by by all of the other staff more than once in that time. \\n\\nWhen we finally got a chance to order, the only time we saw our waitress in the next 25 minutes was when she dropped by to ask if we had gotten our beers at the bar, and if we had closed out our tab there. (We had, and.. this just shows some serious lack of organization) The next time we saw her, she finally brought the beer that I had ordered from another waitress when our food was delivered. \\n\\nThe food was the only positive part of this venture. I had the chicken curry, and it was savory and delicious. The roasted potatoes were perfect, and the chicken was tender. \\n\\nTerrible prices. Terrible service at the front of the house. Terrible table service. This place might be great if you can wedge yourself in at the bar on a Wednesday afternoon, but .. until they get a ringmaster, or a staff willing to share the burden of a busy evening, I'd recommend staying away."},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"After biking around Stanley Park for a couple hours, my bf and I were starving. There were a lot of people at Cactus Club Cafe, so it took around ~30 minutes for us to be seated near the bar area to watch football.\\n\\nWe ordered a ton of appetizers, specifically the Tuna Stack, Ravioli + Prawn Trio, Mini Burgers, and Kobe Style Meatball Duo. I liked the Tuna Stack because the albacore tasted fresh and the refreshing citrus vinaigrette tied the dish together well. I also liked the sweet butternut squash and marscapone raviolis with the flavorful truffle butter sauce. Jumbo prawns, however, were slightly overcooked and had a chewy, rubbery texture. Mini burgers were good, but quite dry. I also had the Frose and Nothing but Pink cocktails. Frose was an absolute delight, while the pink cocktail was just overly sweet. I also returned the Signature Sangria because it tasted like my cough syrup lol.\\n\\nOverall, I had a blast at Cactus Club Cafe on my first night in Vancouver; Both food and drinks were above my expectations. Our server, Cassandra, is so sweet because she surprised my bf and I with an anniversary dessert at the end. The DJ in the corner also played all my favorite songs."},{"name":"Taco Del Mar","address":"15735 SE Happy Valley Town Ctr Dr","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"2.5","text":"I am always really full after eating here.

We got drinks at the bar first, I got the bad juju which is their margarita. Very good, loved the smoked salt rim. We got to the table, pretty tight seating , but understandable since they're trying to accommodate as many diners as possible. To start, we got the pumpkin and ricotta bruschetta, was was amazing. You get two huge slices, and it's drizzled with a balsamic reduction, very tasting. My boyfriend had the salmon dish he says it was excellent. I had the truffle and prosciutto Mac and cheese, so good (although it's hard to mess up that combination). I could only finish half of the serving, and everyone else around me who ordered it also had trouble finishing, but I really am looking forward to the leftovers!

Everyone in there was dressed up, which is such a breath of fresh air compared to the college bars that I seem to frequent. The decor was beautiful; couldn't help but look around at everything. There is also a \\"private\\" back area tucked away near the restrooms, so if you need a break from dancing, you can go back there and chat with friends. The bathrooms were beautiful as well; very sleek, mirrors everywhere, and clean. I found out after as well that it's lit green outside if it is open, and the lights around the door turn red when it's occupied! \\n\\nIt was pretty easy to navigate the venue, layout wise. It was pretty packed which made moving difficult at points, but the lounge/seating areas are placed very strategically to allow for easy movement around the club.\\n\\nDrinks are expensive, but not too much more than what you would usually spend at a bar.

It's worth the wait!\\n\\nIn general, I go for the savoury buckwheat crepes. The two classics that I've stuck with over the years are Chevre and L'Artiche, though their new pesto+brie combo is also delicious.\\n\\nMost of the ingredients come from the farmers market, so they're always really fresh and well worth the ~$8 cost.\\n\\nPro tips: Bike to the market (the area has super limited parking) and wear sunscreen (you'll be in line for at least 15 mins)."},{"name":"Felipe's Taqueria","address":"83 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Can't tell how much of a chain this place is...but it doesn't feel like one.

For example, the Japanese-imported Nissin \\"Chikenraamen\\" 5-pack costs around a dollar less than the one I saw at Izumiya over in Alderbridge and No. 3 Road in Richmond. (n.b. I swear this is the original, real chicken ramen recipe by Momofuku himself.

Our server Damarra was a sweetheart, gave great service, and you can tell she enjoys her job....because of her and the food, I am giving two stars. This review is based on the following experience:\\n\\nLet me begin by saying I am in the food service industry and I am pretty well versed and cognizant of how customers should be treated. A friend and I visited this location on early Saturday afternoon around 12:15ish and I am surprised to say it was pretty slow in the establishment with maybe 5 or 6 other parties besides us visible in the dining area. When I went to the restroom to wash my hands, I noticed they were also hosting a large party in a private dining area. All in all, pretty slow for Maggiano's.\\nThey sat a young couple next to us and apparently it's their first time visiting Maggiano's. No problem, I remember mine too. The chef brings them out a complimentary appetizer and engages them in conversation. Next, here comes who I presume is one of the managers and he also stops over and converses with the couple. Wait for it, two minutes after he leaves another young lady comes over to indulge them once more. Mind you, our booth is literally right next to theirs. You could've construed that the couple was famous with the amount of attention doted on them. I'm good though, I promise you I would not want nor expect that amount of attention while dining.\\nHere's the problem though, going back to what I said earlier, the location was not busy or bustling with customers. Could any of the barrage of visitors to that table have asked us how we were doing, how was our meal, did we have everything we needed, made eye contact, smiled? Anything? So this is how you treat your customers who have been faithful and loyal over the years....customers who have brought others in to dine...gave gift cards to your restaurants as gifts? We didn't deserve any acknowledgement? NONE! No lie, if a representative of Maggiano's looks at this review and then reviews the CCTV, they will see what I have stated here is an honest review.\\nKinda reminds me of doing business with some of these companies who lure you in with all kinds of treats, discounts, or freebies. They forget about you or treat you bad as their customer because they have you locked in contracts BUT you are only valuable to them once you are leaving and/or have left  them and then they pay attention. Maggiano's should be proactive about keeping their customers and understand that perception is reality. Just because it's not a diner's first visit, you acknowledge them just the same ( never miss an opportunity especially when it's slow) and never treat them like the money they are spending is insignificant... Just saying....customer service is EVERYTHING and if you think its ok to treat your customers like this and they all leave feeling the way we did.. Or it's possible they just don't care because obviously they will stay in business without my patronage...Shame on you Maggiano's!"},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is some deluxe 'Q. \\n\\nStep 1: Order a tray with brisket, mac n cheese (obvi) and farm salad.

Realize the tin cup is burning you and abandon the thick, creamy mac for the farm salad. Feel health flow through you with each bite, especially the ones containing brussels sprouts because even though you think you don't like them, your mouth is telling you that you do like them. You like them a lot. Shovel more salad in to offset the next course: broccoli cheese casserole, which falls flat in the presence of the cheesy mac and the health of the farm salad. It is mushy and mostly flavorless. Set it aside in favor of more pleasing delights. Room in your stomach is at a premium. The weak get left behind. \\n\\nStep 4: Leave, sleep, repeat, minus the broccoli cheese casserole."},{"name":"Yakuza","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Yakuza is a conundrum. The first few times I ventured in shortly after they opened their doors I was pleased by the decor and thrilled with the food but puzzled by service. It was a sort of free for all with attendance off and on by every person on the floor which caused some confusion despite the attentiveness. Orders were confused. Despite this, the food was so original, fresh, and tasty that I returned a few months ago to have vegetarian sushi including an eggplant sashimi that was out of this world! A few weeks after that my husband and I went into have a drink to be told by the bartender that the entire \\nmenu had changed and that Sushi rolls were off the menu as well as the eggplant sashimi and some other favorite items. We were bummed but yet again decided to give it another try just last night. Sushi is back on the menu and it was very good. I had a fabulous white peach salad and my husband started with the crispy pork tenders which he loved. The service was fair. This time - a single waiter who admitted to being brand new also tended bar and made a poor version of the wasabi martini. He was however, doing fine throughout service until the end when he left us for business on the patio. We had to flag down the other server to get the check and ask about dessert to which he reluctantly agreed to deliver the info with a smile (?) that no, they no longer had dessert because the gelato dealer they had been going through was no longer available. hmmm...seems they could find another? I recall that in the early days they had only one dessert which was a sort of pudding with fried something covering it. I always figured they would boost the dessert menu once they got enough requests but - nope, now they have none...cus of that one gelato dealer.\\nYakuza puzzles me.\\n\\n\\n***NEWS FLASH***\\nThis place is back on track. Gave it another try and service was great, food was delicious. Todd had the spicy tuna roll (I think). We had the wonderfully simple and refreshing squash salad and the fried chevre - both very good.

My review is only on the veggie burger.\\n\\nFirst off, let me mention that there are two different veggie burger patties offered. #1, which I ordered, is known as the most popular among the two. The patty has cheese inside of it. Veggie patty #2 does not, and has a lot of soy in it instead. From what the staff was telling me, veggie patty #2 is vegan. As a former vegan I know how important it is that your food is cooked separately from meat. Well, both veggie patties are cooked in a separate area from the organic beef, so vegans rejoice!\\n\\nMy actual veggie burger was just okay. The patty looks really weird, so I was skeptical as hell. I took a bite and I was hit with a bit of blandness. I expected it to be more flavorful. It wasn't nasty. It just wasn't amazing. I've had my fair share of veggie burgers as a former vegetarian and vegan, and I must say that this one was unremarkable. Halfway through my burger the patty did begin to crumble a bit.

Once, a member of my party found a twist tie in her burger (in the meat, she bit into her burger and it was cooked into the patty) when we told the server, he simply said \\"oh...I can throw that away for you...\\" no apologies and when we asked for the meal to be comped he had to get a manager involved, who was reluctant to provide restitution (again, no apology for A TWIST TIE IN THEIR MEAT) this place is cheap and open 24 hours, and very convenient if you work late hours like I do, but trust me, there are far better places in the area.

Basically with the small grill it ate up a lot of the time limit we had for the all you can eat meal. \\n\\nPrices were fair and we did come away full.

While the atmosphere is definitely the focus (and worth checking out), it's difficult to enjoy when overly crowded - which it frequently is. The first two times I visited the restaurant, waits for a table were very long. Obviously, this could've been resolved by making sure we'd had a reservation. But come on - you can't PLAN for the sushi cravings, they just happen. At any rate, we spent more time at (or around) the bar than at the dinner table. \\n\\nThe restaurant has a variety of seating, including a spacious (and charming, I must admit) patio. Whether seated inside or out, I recall waiting for a long time for our server to show up, a longer time for the food to arrive. Granted, amazing sushi takes time, but the quality of Haiku's rolls doesn't reflect the time it takes to get them to your table. Some of the specialty rolls are worthwhile, but the standards (the spicy tuna or dragon rolls are the marks by which I typically measure) left something to be desired. Prices were standard (pricey, that is) for sushi. I'm happy to splurge for quality food, but this just narrowly missed the mark.\\n\\nThat said, making a reservation and a good deal of patience are vital to a good trip to Haiku. Perfect for a first date, now that I think of it - a vibrant, romantic setting and lots of distractions if things aren't going so well and PLENTY of time for long conversations if they are. \\n\\n(Oh - and if you're considering takeout, perhaps rethink that choice. It took us as long to get our to-go order as it would have to just get a table. And sushi definitely suffers when it's boxed up and taken home.)"},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wonderful ambience but overpriced food and wine and, at 6:20 when we were first waited on, we were told happy hour was over (it's until 6:30)."},{"name":"Taqueria Los Hermanos","address":"4418 Hugh Howell Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"I once walked by this place and looked at the menu and promised myself I would come back at a later time.

I will equate it to Bergerville in terms of overall bang for your buck as far as quantity goes, but I would take Bergerville over Chick-fil-A nine out of 10 times.

I had heard a lot of hype about this place and had to come check it out \\"Hans Solo\\" during a work break.\\n\\nTHE GOOD\\n- The house decor and layout of the patio section was very well done. If you're keen to eating outside, this place has a nice ambiance (minus the occasional fast driver whizzing by on West 6th Street). The bar is well layed out (typical U-shape design) with a cool copper top and plenty of ambient sunlight. \\n- I ordered the Calamari appetizer and the Misto Salad with grilled chicken. The salad was the small size and was plenty tasteful (didn't feel there was too much cheese like some of the previous reviews here). The ingredients tasted very fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing was superb (had a little tang to tit...I liked it).\\n- I was able to use my new Tabbed Out phone app to pay my tab. Pretty cool!\\n\\nTHE FAIR\\n- The calamari was a bit to much breading a tad bit oily. I found it weird that they served it in a wire frame basket with wax paper as the lining. The paper of course got oily and it separated (tore through) when I tried to fork my calamari, causing it to spill all over the bar. Not so cool.....\\n\\nTHE BAD\\n- Service was a little suspect. I'm assuming because it was a Tuesday late lunch? I did have a crew of employees and/or vendors at the end of the bar. They seemed fine and professional, but my bartender was more interested in hanging out with them than checking on me.  When I asked for a napkin to clean up the calamari that spilled on the bar (fully expecting him to shoot me a \\"no worries, I got that for you man\\"), he handed me a napkin and walked away. I guess I have to work for my food around here? \\n\\nFINAL TAKE\\nSeems like a good spot for happy hour and dinner. I again would suggest the patio area. Like all new spots, I would give this one another try (prob with a group next time). Hopefully the service will improve!"},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Another one of my favorite brunch places in the Boston area. Brookline Lunch has a GREAT value and AWESOME omelettes.\\n\\nI'm usually a french toast/ pancakes type of brunch gal, but Brookline Lunch has opened up my eyes to another realm of brunch: omelettes. They have such a huge variety - seriously, don't order anything else as you will be disappointed. Omelettes are their specialty, and they are their own unique little creation (see pics).\\n\\nI love that this is a tiny little tucked away restaurant, in the heart of Central Square but easily missed if you're not looking for it. It has a great casual atmosphere and seems to be a family run business. Every time I've been there, it's been the same woman serving EVERY single table - I'm always amazed at how she serves so many tables yet keeps her cheery demeanor! However as it's a small little business, I have made plans to come here before only to find that they've closed for the day (this is a holiday, it's like on an average Saturday).\\n\\nPOSITIVES:\\n- Get the omelettes!! I usually don't like omelettes, but I love Brookline Lunch's!\\n- Relaxed & friendly atmosphere. Cute, tucked away little restaurant.\\n- Incredibly good value. All omelettes are under $6 or so. I treated like six people to brunch here and it barely made a dent in my wallet.\\n\\nNEGATIVES:\\n- As it's a small (family owned I'm guessing?) business, I've come here only to find that they've randomly closed.

It's so nice to see a full, colorful plate! A hefty sandwich cut in half surrounded by a heap of homefries and veggies. I was feeling especially classy and ordered my breakfast sandwich with salmon, which was a great decision, as the fish was tender and added a nice element. The sandwich is grilled, cheesy, eggy, and just the right amount of drippy and oozy. It's served on soft Texas toast which is charred perfectly and provides just the right absorbancy and texture to house the mm mm good fillings. \\n\\nHomefries were prepared well, although I've had better, and I really enjoyed the pile of veggies which provided a (somewhat) healthy balance. The homemade chili sauce on the table was just alright in my opinion, since I didn't taste much flavor and the heat hits you later.

The place had lots of empty tables and we picked a spot by the window.  There were threats of rain showers, otherwise, we probably wold have taken one of the outside tables.\\n\\nThere were three of us, with moderate appetites.  Although it's not on the lunch menus we asked for the Fat Cheeks tray (three meats and three sides).  We ordered the ribs, pulled pork and brisket along with mac and cheese, cole slaw and beans.  Oh and a bucket o' biscuits with honey butter. \\n\\nWhile we waited for the food we tested out the BBQ sauces on the table.  They smelled and tasted so good we could not wait for the food to arrive.\\n\\nTo start, the biscuits.  These delicious piles of gluten are worth every carb they have in them.  Light, flaky, buttery.  There are not adequate words to describe how good these things are.  Order a bucket for now then order a second one to take home.  I know from personal experience that they reheat very well.  We took home our leftovers and when I opened the package, they added a container of honey butter. \\n\\nAll of the meats were smoky and delicious, but my personal favorite was the brisket.  The pulled pork had real porcine flavor, almost a gaminess you expect from lamb or venison.  The rib I tasted was fantastic as well.\\n\\nAll of the aforementioned BBQ sauces added extra levels of yum to the meat (and for one of us the beans).  They were so good we took home bottles of the Sweet Cheeks BBQ sauce and the HOT habenero sauce.\\n\\nI loved the cole slaw and the beans, both had flavors that were spot on.  The mac and cheese was perfectly creamy but the sauce had a strong taste of wine/vermouth, which was interesting but not expected.\\n\\nWe had some time to kill before heading out, so we ordered dessert.  What came to us was another of those amazing biscuits this time piled high with macerated strawberries, whipped cream and lemon curd.  As it is often said near Fenway, so good, so good, so good!  The lemon curd was a great addition and something I will do when I make strawberry shortcake in the future.\\n\\nThe only downside of the meal was the service.  The restaurant was not even half full and yet service was painfully slow.

My Bestfriend and I went to celebrate our move to a better location and we thought of nowhere better to go then Old Chicago, because unlike the overrated McMennamins, Old Chicago actually makes their calzones fresh. McMennamins makes their's in the morning with no alterations possible i.e. No mushrooms. First off when we got there we realized that my buddy forgot his wallet back at the house. We asked Megan (the most wonderful server I have ever had! Anywhere ever!) to hold our place as we went back to get the wallet. She did so without a problem. When we got back she welcomed us and had perfect suggestions for beers. We mentioned that we wanted to each get a different calzone and cut it in half so we could get a half of eachother's (experience all the flavors) she made a request to make 4 half sized calzones rather than cut in half because it would have made a mess and not been nearly as good. That was wonderful! The half sized calzones were perfect! As we were sitting there we were curious about the WBT (World Beer Tour) she took the time to explain to us the rewards cards and how the WBT works. we each had one half sized calzone left she brought us the boxes and as we were waiting to pay our check my buddy and I got caught up in a passionate discussion regarding movies and incredible actors. We ended up leaving with our boxes still on the table. I called and she remembered exactly who I was and told me to come back and get it. (Eventhough unbeknownst to me they were closed) we rushed back and Megan let my buddy in to grab the food! Even had it all bagged up! The cooks made absolutely wonderful calzones! Especially regarding the request. Again Megan was absolutely incredible. I'll be coming back all the time especially since I now live nearby!

Look out, 35 Shrimp!  Silly me.\\nAs soon as we were handed the menus, we knew this was NOT the Ale House we were used to. There are maybe 6 sport-bar-friendly entrees to choose from plus a build-a-burger and salads. I'm used to a menu the size of a phone book! \\n\\n Ummm....When we questioned our server she was quick to give us a well-rehearsed spiel about how Davenport Ale House is not part of the Miller's Ale House chain. Ohhhh...From the outside, you certainly fooled us, including the signage. There is a huge outside seating area which actually would be a really great place to have bands play if this place stays open.\\n\\nSo it's called Ale House, where's the beer menu? There isn't one. The server had a Xeroxed copy of one we could look at, but had to give back. Table ads were pushing domestic drafts (even with 16 taps going) for a Happy Hour special of $2.50. What about cocktails? Shots were encouraged as highballs were only $1 off instead of the BOGO that I'm normally accustomed to. OK, give me a Seven and Ginger. No, not 7Up and Ginger ale, Seagram's 7 and Ginger ale. Bless your heart. The sweet tea was really good. \\n\\nWe immediately whipped out our phones, looking for reviews and as we were reading them, we got nervous. But we were also really hungry, so we figured we would give it a shot. The only vegetables available with the entrees that offered vegetables was steamed broccoli, so I went with the bbq rib tips and chips. My boyfriend went for the traditional fish and chips and my girlfriend got a build a burger.\\n\\nWhen the plates came to the table 18 minutes later, two of us had puzzled looks on their faces. There was yellow sauce all over the meat, which I identified as very mustardy honey mustard. When I asked the server about the \\"barbecue sauce\\" she said that it was their own special recipe. While it wasn't terrible, it certainly was not what I was expecting. I also expected the rib tips to be like beef tips, slices of meat off of the bone. These were slices of ribs with the cartilage in the middle, then baked or braised. They were tender, but with the unusual tangy mustard sauce and having to spit out a piece of cartilage for each one, it was a bit off-putting. I don't think they would have much flavor on their own. \\nThe house made potato chips were good and very crispy like I asked, but they were not warm as if they had just been prepared. They were not even warm as if they had been under a heat lamp. They were just there, with no seasoning besides table salt, taking up half my plate. \\n\\nMy boyfriend was highly disappointed that he was given potato chips with his fried fish instead of the traditional British \\"chip\\" aka fries. When he pointed that out to the server she cheerfully took his plate and brought it back with fries. He also asked for extra tartar sauce that the server failed to mention who would be an additional 65 cents. Yes it's not much, but it's the principle. He said it was ok, nothing special.\\nMy girlfriend's burger seem to be cooked exactly the way that she liked it, in fact the server asked her to cut into it to make sure since she wanted it medium, pink inside and there was a new chef and she wanted to make sure it was done right. New chef? You just opened!\\n\\nAtmosphere? Sports bar with a zillion tvs with the sound off and no close-captions with classic rock over the speakers. A little more lighting might be nice when/if there is more than a 2-page menu. We got seated right away at 6-ish pm, which was another clue this wasn't \\"THE\\" Ale House we were looking for. The hostess and servers were friendly and we didn't have to ask for any drink refills. They even offer a 10% Disney Cast Member discount, which softened me into giving 3 stars instead of just 2.\\n\\n Apparently there will be a grand re-opening with additional menu items coming soon, but it will take a lot more to encourage me to come back; I'd rather go to Perkins or IHOP than this mediocre, knockoff, Polk-County, wannabe Ale House."},{"name":"Agave Azul Cocina Mexicana","address":"5248 Red Bug Lake Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"Amazing atmosphere, impeccable service and authentic Mexican cuisine!\\n\\nWe visit this restaurant almost every Tuesday and they never disappoint.

It's become somewhat of a holy grail, my quest for good clams in Atlanta.  First off, the portions...a little skimpy for the price tag, especially during summer when clams tend to be more plentiful (I think? Don't quote me on that).  Secondly, the size...bellies were a little small.  Third, preparation...very overcooked, the fried breading that had some cornmeal mixed in was tasty but very brown.  Lastly, the clams...tasted old, and very fishy like they had been sitting around for awhile, though they had not gone bad yet (is that a bright side? I guess.).  Legal Seafood's fried clams are looking better and better in comparison to all of their competition, and a deal too w/their hefty portions, giant clam bellies, tasty simple preparation, & comparably value prices.\\n\\nOther items- bread and butter for the table was awesome...it's by request so definitely ask for it, especially if you got the mussels like I did, so you can dunk fresh bread in the curry sauce instead of the 2 hard stale slices they give you with the mussels.

The entire time we were waiting tables remained empty as they saved them for no-shows.

It was given to me after being stirred for maybe 5 seconds.  \\n\\nAlso I noticed they charge $22 for a 22oz bottle of Cisco Grey Lady.  That's absurd.

Most reviews mention the portions were small.  They must have fixed this because I eat a lot, and I thought the portions were more than adequate.  I walked out of there stuffed after eating one of their treys.  Had some of the best pulled pork I have ever had.  The brisket was GREAT.  But, it was a little bit too fatty (I know brisket is supposed to have a layer of fat).  I got three pieces of brisket, 2 were OK.  But the third was an actual strip of fat with no meat on it.  They really shouldn't serve that.  Flavor was AMAZING.  Sides were great as well.\\n\\nA little pricey, but its great BBQ in the Fenway area.  To be expected and certainly not outrageous.

It is perfect for what it is and not really comparable to a fine-dining experience.\\n\\nWhat it is perfect for is a simple sushi restaurant. This is where you go when you are near Davie st. and you think to yourself \\"I want some above average sushi\\". It is typically small with seats for about 30-40 people and even then you will be crammed together. The prices are not the cheapest sushi you can find in the West End (I doubt it is the most expensive) but the price at least matches the quality.\\n\\nI ordered spicy tuna rolls and the tuna and salmon sashimi. The Sashimi came within 2 minutes and at first I was a little miffed that the pieces were so large. I was ok with the overall portion (I would say it was generous) but each chunk of fish was quite large. Then I ate one and it turned out to be a perfect size - and it was high quality. I'm a bit snobby about sushi and this stuff satisfied me. The spicy tuna was also fantastic tasting.\\n\\nThis isn't the best sushi I have ever eaten but I guarantee I will be back to this place when I want something a step above average cheap Vancouver sushi.

From the moment you cross the wooden bridge spanning a pond and cascading waterfall, you are in Aloha heaven. The place is directed with tiki statues, fishing nets, an outrigger canoe, and glowing pufferfish suspended from a thatched-roof ceiling. With ukelele-heavy Hawaiian music playing, naturally. Service was prompt and friendly. We slid into a dimly lit, romantic booth, even though it was 10:30 AM on a bright and hot Sunday morning. I ordered a bloody mary that was tasty, spicy, and unique thanks to the addition of kimchi (giving it a vinegary tang) and a pickled quail egg. Thankfully, the waitress had warned me about this, because it looks like an oversized olive. My fiance opted for a mimosa made with pineapple juice and a dash of absinthe (!). This was subtle and tasted more champagne-y than most mimosas do. \\n\\nWe were there for brunch, and I went with the Portugese Breakfast platter, consisting of fluffy scrambled eggs, Portugese sausage, white rice seasoned with furikake for a little zest and crunch, sliced avocados, and grape tomatoes, served with a sweet red sauce that truly complemented the sausage.

She chose the Red Eye breakfast: grilled ham, sweet cinnamon apple slices, and buttermilk biscuits doused in a red eye gravy whose consistency was thinner than a cream-based gravy. The ham was juicy and tender, and paired beautifully with the apples. Everything was very good. \\n\\nWe didn't get to see the famed erupting volcano, though a thunderstorm did roll through at one point, heightening the ambience to cheesy perfection. \\n\\nTheir cocktail list alone has over 100 spirits to choose from, with a heavy emphasis on rum.

Yikes. It was good, though. Jasper's Rum Punch (Jamaican rum, lime, and allspice) was more reasonably priced at $8. I thought the serving size was rather petite, but this one was every bit as strong as the Zombie, so no complaints there.

Our waitress was friendly and very attentive. Several in our party ordered appetizers (the Szechuan Chicken Lettuce Wraps are enough for a meal!) and drinks (The Fros√© was delicious - very hard not ordering two!) which were all delicious  and then we ordered a bottle of wine for the table (all bottles are 1/2 price on Tuesday!) and our main courses (The Tuna Poke Bowl was DIVINE and completely crave-worthy. Personally I would skip the Pesto Chicken Quesadilla though - it's just ok, and with so many other delicious options, it just didn't stand up to the others.) There was an issue with one person in our party not receiving their meal after everyone else had gotten theirs, but the same manager came out to check on us, and immediately personally went to go rectify the situation. That same wonderful manager checked on us at the end of our meal, and said he had already taken that person's sandwich off the bill for it being so late and he had also comped our table's wine as a courtesy because of the issue getting a table at the beginning. He then added that since he knew we were there to celebrate their anniversary, he would also like to offer us dessert, which we took him up on. (The Caramel Chocolate Mousse was the table favorite - make sure to order at LEAST the double! Trust me. ) Everything was delicious and we all agreed that what started off pretty shaky had turned into one of the best meals of our whole trip.\\n\\nHaving said that, I do think that it would behoove them to offer reservations on OpenTable or a way to 'call ahead' using the NoWait app. That way there would be more accurate tracking and better analytics to ensure they have enough staff on hand for the anticipated volume - which is always very high at this location."},{"name":"Burger Stevens","address":"6238 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First the good: Burger was very good.\\n\\nNow the bad: Burger was also tiny.

Can't say enough about this trailer, they are the masters of hot sandwiches.  You come up to this chicken koop of a trailer thinking you may get some kookie action but most all of what they offer is fresh, healthy, appetizing, and tastes exceptional.  Of the 2 hot sandwiches I've had so far I'd say no one comes close to quality and quantity.  \\n\\nFirst Visit as a Gonzo Virgin - - it's 11pm Sunday night Memorial Day weekend.  I have a friend in town visiting, she's not drunk or pregnant, she's in great shape, and she's got hunger pains.  She specifically requests me to find her some good trailer grub so I drive down E. 6th because there's bound to be something available, right?  NOT!  Most everything is closed, however, I do see a spotlight shining in the E. 6th Food Trailer Park and a crowd next to this big rooster head - -looks like we found our oasis!\\n\\nEven though there are 2 trailers open but everyone is standing in line at Gonzo Juice.  We look over the menu - it actually looks appetizing:  smoothies, shakes, salads, wraps and hot sandwiches - a very diverse menu.  She goes for Grandma's Orchard Wrap without onions and a Nutty Uncle Shake, I'm going for some liquid action tonight - - the Melon Patch drink and California Bubba Smoothie please.  Turns out we're their last order - - they ran out of almost everything.  \\n\\nThe breakdown:\\n- Melon Patch was really awesome!  Light, refreshing, quenched my thirst, and not too sweet.  \\n- Cali Bubba Smoothie was superb!  Not too sweet, tasted the banana and blueberry, and it filled me up too - - just what I wanted, nothing too heavy or sugary.  I will definitely be back for this one. \\n- The Nutty Uncle Shake was excellent!  What's not to like w/ ice cream, peanut butter, and chocolate?  It was really filling too - - a really nice sweet treat for a hot and muggy night. \\n- Grandma's Orchard Wrap - - they forgot to take out the onions, she started picking them off, they were like \\"hey, our bad, we can make you another one right now - - we got enough ingredients\\" - - sure thing!  What was really cool about that was they were already cleaning up and ready to jet, exhausted from the last rush, and they still were eager to please and brought the food back out and made her another wrap without onions - - that's customer service!!  They let us keep the other one - - I had it for lunch the next day, it ROCKED!!  And I love onions.  \\n\\nRecent Visits:  \\n- Had to come back for the Pig Roast Sandwich (sweet pulled pork, provolone, tangy carrot slaw, brown mustard grilled on Texas Toast).  It's their top seller - - and hot damn now I know why!  I took it home (see pic) and devoured it.  That was honestly the BEST pulled pork sandwich I've ever had, sweet n salty n tangy n a mouthful as it's so damn big you won't be able to get your mouth around it (that's what she said).  A Top 3 Hot Sandwich for sure.  \\n\\n- Ruby Shoes:  Jewish Rye Bread, pastrami, swiss, sauerkraut, sweet chile chipotle russian dressing - - probably the best pastrami sandwich I've had since I can remember, and I don't think anyone in town comes close.  Reminded me of a NYC Deli with an added twist, it was a feast loaded with meat and I could only finish half of it.  \\n\\nExcellent quality food that tastes great, consistency out-of-your-way friendly and eager to please customer service, and they're consistent on every visit.  Evan and his cohort do a great job, and they've now added some friendly n fashionable females who meet n greet you with sweet smile, very cute and that can't hurt - -they love playing 80's and 90's rap for entertainment.

Ahi tuna salad, chardonnay, lovely conversation, spectacular dining room, and 1.5 hours waiting on and off for our bill.\\n\\nLets start with the food.  My group had a turkey sandwich and caesar salad, the ahi tuna salad, and the salmon burger with fries. \\n\\nThe turkey sandwich is hard to mess up. it was okay, but you kind of expect a wow factor for a restaurant that is charging a high price for it.  The caesar was bland. It's kind of crazy to say that because usually you get a garlic punch, or nice parmesan and anchovy flavor. It was watery and weird.\\n\\nThe salmon burger and fries were actually the highlight of our meal.  Again, nothing mind blowing, but it was well executed and flavorful.\\n\\nMy ahi tuna was cooked absolutely perfectly.  The rest of the salad looked like the swedish chef made it.  Roughly chopped romaine, fennel, and celery really detracted from the otherwise beautiful taste of tuna. Who puts celery in salads anymore? I mean it's the height of summer, you are directly across from the vancouver farmers market, and the best thing you could think of was romaine and inch thick cubes of celery? also, there were whole cashews. I like cashews as much as the next person, but they were too big and not even toasted. toast the nuts. always. more flavor. cooking 101.\\nOh yeah, and that salad was $18. It's a hotel, I understand the mark up, but for $18 I expected something a little more gourmet.\\n\\nSo for all of the above, I would give 3 stars. Room for improvement, overpriced, but a good spot for classy atmosphere and business lunches.\\n\\nFor service, I would give one star. the only redeeming quality were the glowing personalities of the entire staff.  they kept on smiling, they tried to make things right, and hey, we got dessert.\\n\\nSo I paid with a gift certificate that i received for another less than stellar experience at the hilton (oh the irony). We waited 20 minutes after finishing our meal for our server to give us the check.  I put the gift certificate in the holder and wait another 10 minutes for them to pick it up. Then we wait. 30 minutes later I hadn't seen our server anywhere so I flagged down another server and kindly* asked them if we could get the receipt (it was an $80 GC and the bill was $52) and the balance on the GC.\\n\\n*please note, even in the most frustrating service moments, I tend to ere on the nice side no matter what. people have shitty days, I don't know what is going on BOH, things happen, so it's always better to keep cool, smile, and acknowledge the other person as a human being deserving of respect and graciousness*\\n\\nServer #2 comes back and says our server went on lunch and forgot to check back with us. lovely. maybe he was having the swedish chef ahi. Server one comes back and asked if we wanted our receipt *yes please and the balance* he then states that there is no balance as there is a use it or lose it policy on their GC.  We ask if that is written on the GC and he says no. we say, perhaps it should be as you owe us $28 in unspent credit.\\n\\nNow, I brought cash to tip on whatever our total was because that's what you do. I wasn't going to walk away with 3 martinis worth of GC left to spend. It just felt fundamentally wrong to not only not tell us that unwritten policy, but to completely walk away from our table and leave us hanging.\\n\\nSo, server one goes to check with the manager about making a copy and giving me the original with the remainder signed and dated, since he needs the GC for his till and to cash out at the end of his service. Totally understandable. I'll wait. 15 minutes later another staff member comes down and lets us know they are printing up another GC with the remaining balance.  I feel like a tool making them do all this for $28, but it was the principle of it!\\n\\nServer two comes back with complimentary chocolate cake for our troubles and profuse apologies for the wait. He was cool.\\n\\nServer One comes back with the original GC, amount scratched out, new amount written, receipt on the back. 1.5 hours for that. Amazing. I told him to have a lovely rest of the day and I hope he is able to get out and enjoy the sunshine. I really meant that. He seemed to be having a tough day and sun makes everything better.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the chocolate cake was delicious on it's own and didn't need the super sweet berry coulis, just whipped cream and maybe a few berries, or perhaps a vanilla bean creme anglaise.  Also, up your food game to the high class atmosphere you rock. It doesn't take high end ingredients to make a high end meal. keep it simple, well made, and fresh.

It was a very intimate wedding with four of us in total, and we figured that Italian food and wine would be the perfect laid back wedding dinner. I reserved a table 10 days in advance, and I mentioned over the phone that it was our wedding dinner. We didn't request anything special except to be sat at a good table.\\n\\nWe showed up to our reservation and our table was right in the middle of the restaurant, next to the entrance door. We asked to be sat elsewhere, since the place was not full.\\nI'd like to add that I was wearing a freaking wedding gown, so there's no way at this point the service staff doesn't know that this is a wedding dinner.\\n\\nWe sat down at our new table, ordered some wine. The serving staff informed us that we had to order all courses at once, so we ordered 4 appetizers and 4 main courses to share amongst the 4 of us. Appetizers were served quickly and were tasty, but I noticed that the plates were kind of greasy and had fingerprints on them. A little surprising but oh well. Food was good.\\nOur server came back to take the empty plates since the main courses were (already) ready. We weren't quite done with the appetizers, but she didn't ask and just took away the plates. \\nMain courses were served and plates were dirty again (could be from our server's hands?). Food was bland and lack refinement. We also ran out of wine, but there was no servers around. We were almost finished eating when the server came back to our table to ask \\"if everything was still perfect?\\", showing us the thumbs up, and quickly walked away before we had time to actually say anything. \\n\\nIt was our wedding night so we decided to make the best of it regardless of the less than impressive service and rushed supper. So we ordered several deserts, as well as the best grappa from their list (grappa being one of the reasons why we reserved there in the first place). We were informed that they didn't have the grappa we wanted, but the server recommended to try the \\"flight\\", which is a tasting of three different sorts of grappa, and we agreed. Two of them were delicious, but there was one drink that was not grappa, it was some kind of liqueur that tasted like limoncello. It might have been made with grappa or something, but it was not actual grappa, it was super sweet and it wasn't at all what we were looking for. I informed our server that this was more like a liqueur and not what we had in mind at all, and her answer was \\"it's grappa, I saw him pour it from the bottle\\". And she walk away, and came back with the check. Never even offered to replace it with something different.\\n\\nIt was the most underwhelming dinning experience I've had in a while, and it happened to be on my wedding day. I regret going there. At no point were we offered even one drink or one piece of cake just to at least say \\"congratulations, and thank you for choosing to dine with us on your big day\\". I understand that this is not an obligation, but any decent establishment will highlight a special event with at least a little something. We also were charged for the drink we didn't like, even if it wasn't actually what we ordered.\\n\\nThey have a beautiful patio and an interesting liquor list.

That fact is no secret and is the only reason I ever go to CBC. The food is really terrible and overpriced. They're trying to be upscale in menu while forgetting the purpose of the restaurant... fill people's tummies so they don't get too wasted on delicious beer. The only menu item that I can stomach is the Cuban sandwich. Not great, tolerable. \\n\\nThe beer, on the other hand, is delicious. I'm a huge fan of pumpkin beers and their doesn't disappoint. The stout I had last night was also superior to many available at the packie. Plus, you can pop in for a growler at the bargain price of $10 per 64oz jug. That's four full pints!! Heck, just get yourself a growler and cook dinner at home.\\n\\nMy biggest pet peeve about CBC is the height of the bar. I feel like a 12 year old because the bar is just too tall for the chairs and I can't get comfortable. They should keep adult-sized booster seats on hand to make up the difference.

Certainly not on top of their service (a bit slow on the ordering and delivery), but I think the servers are so kind, that I'll let it slide for now. Definitely try to get the table in the sunroom if you can, as I find the other tables a bit gloomy. \\n\\nGood coffee and interesting spreads if you ask for it (strawberry chocolate? YESSsss.) So far I like the Not So Southern Eggs Benedict lots; it wasn't super heavy (y'know, had a little green peeking out from the sauce) if you're into that. I've given the pancakes, waffles, potatoes, All-American-y stuff a try - they're all decently good, if not standard. Their take on the beignet is interesting - definitely worth a try.

Not knowing the area, especially the effects the game makes on wait times at restaurants, we were ecstatic to find only a small line to order.\\nI ordered the prosciutto and poached eggs, while my husband got the sweet potato and turkey hash.  My dish blew my mind.  FIrst, I've never had bad prosciutto--the focaccia was the make or break ingredient.  However it was \\"toasted,\\" as the menu states, made it easy to eat with the eggs, not too chewy or crumbly or tough or hard. It was crazy toasted, not toasted in a normal toaster.  The eggs were poached with a poacher, not in a vat of simmering water, which I can't complain about because that is how we cook them at home.  And, the icing on the cake was the side arugula salad, dressed in a light white balsamic vinaigrette, not mentioned on the menu. Bonus!\\nThe sweet potato turkey hash was also amazing.  The smokiness of the turkey blended well with the sweet potatoes. That came with two poached eggs, as opposed to the three eggs on the prosciutto dish.\\nThe staff was very friendly and helped us find a table.  My only concern about the restaurant was trying to find a seat, because you are able to order food whether there is available seating or not.  The rain made the outdoor seating unappealing, and there is limited indoor seating.

This location exceeded my expectations not only in size but by friendliness and hospitality. Nicholas was our server for tonight, and was very helpful with our orders. The manager AK, was very kind in introducing himself and even recognized me from their Doctor Phillips location. He not only catered to my grandmothers sensitive diet but even went out of his way to create excellent alternatives for her to try. I could not have been more pleased in stumbling across this hidden gem. We will definitely be back for more :)"},{"name":"Meianna Bakery","address":"2850 SE 82nd Ave, Unit 27","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had a horrible experiance at this bakery today.

We took a Lyft there on Friday night (no drinking and driving!) and finally made it happen.\\n\\nThe location, first of all, is so different from every other Chinese restaurant. The antique building is charming and homelike. We were seated in the dining room, but in this case, it wasn't a large room with many tables--it was a small room about the size of a dining room in a good size private home, with three tables in it. This made for a nice, quiet dinner.\\n\\nWe each ordered a Trader Vic's Mai Tai in an attempt to relive our Hawaiian honeymoon. They came out perfect. For food, we ordered the dan dan noodles as a starter (I've always wanted to try dan dan noodles). I ordered the ma po tofu because I wanted a classic Szechuan entree. He ordered the stir fried prawns with Chengdu spiced chili cucumber. We also ordered the saut√©ed string beans with Chengdu city spice, since we have this thing about needing vegetables at dinner. :)\\n\\nThe appetizer came out at the same time as the rest of the food, but we didn't complain. We were ravenous! The dan dan noodles were a revelation, the perfect \\"ma-la\\" combination: hot chili spice and numbing Szechuan peppercorns. They were deeply flavorful. I could have eaten a boatload of them. The ma po tofu was also amazing. The tofu was so soft it melted in my mouth, and the sauce was wonderfully savory and spicy, just different enough from the dan dan noodles to provide a nice contrast. The string beans were not spicy, but were flavorful and perfectly cooked--just enough snap left on the inside, but wrinkled from high heat on the outside. My husband's shrimp had a slightly spicy, sweet sauce that went very well with the tender, perfectly cooked seafood. The cucumber was a refreshing palate cleanser on the side.\\n\\nWe had one more drink each. My husband got the Chopstick Mai Tai--also very well made, though he said he preferred the Trader Vic's--and I got something whose name I can't remember, but it had a touch of cinnamon and was quite delicious.\\n\\nService was efficient and polite. Even though they brought out all the food at once, we didn't feel rushed, but we also never had to wait long for anything.\\n\\nThe bar near the entrance sounded a little loud on a Friday night, so I wouldn't be likely to sit there if I wanted a good place to chat with my dinner/drinking companion.

When I try a new place I always compare the quality of the food to the price and I am happy to pay more for better quality. (For example, I will go to Ruth Chris for a burger because it is that good). I really felt that the meals at the Lobster Stop, albeit good, were not worth the price. I will give some examples:\\n\\nI ordered the Fish and Chips. I believe the price was $11.99. I think most people can agree that the best fish and chips has a crispy batter on the outside and delicious flaky fish inside.  The fish at the Lobster Stop had a batter that was soggy.  I am not sure if they aren't frying it at a high enough temperature, but something clearly went wrong.  It was hard to get past the soggy batter, but if you do then you will taste the Fish. The fish itself was fresh, but nothing to write home about.  In the end it wasn't worth finishing.  Had this meal been $9 I would have thought that the price was fair for the quality of food.  Here it was priced to high. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the double lobster roll for $19.99.  There was not much meat and the roll was just a random hot dog bun, nothing special and the bun had not been toasted.  There was a sauce on the lobster, sort of a tangy sauce. I'm not sure what that sauce was.  I think most people would prefer not to have that sauce.  We would have asked that it be served without the sauce, but being our first time we didn't know there was going to be a sauce. \\n\\nI ordered the lobster bisque. There were several large chunks of fresh yummy lobster meat in it, but that was it.  Once you ate those few pieces then you were just  having spoonful's of broth.  It was basically just broth with a few large chunks of meat. I forgot the exact price of the bisque, but I remember thinking that it seemed over-priced for the limited amount of lobster in it.  The lobster meat and the bisque itself were good, but not great.\\n\\nI do think the atmosphere of the place s cute and reminiscent of a road side stand.  The staff was nice.

I don't think they're more expensive than Shake Shack, probably even less.

We got lucky and found parking where they rent bicycles for the beltline next door. The line was pretty long. They had a complimentary water station outside to help with the wait in the heat. The sushi burritos were definitely worth it though! I got the tuna with the (spicy) appa sauce and the salmon with the (sweet) umma sauce. We basically tried one half of each burrito.

Instead it was congealed and thick.  They loaded the quinoa with Parmesan cheese too - and although I'm a lover of the parm, this whole dish was MEGA salty.  Tasty enough, but I've had much MUCH better.  The FISH TACOS, however were a WIN - 4 stars, better than the Mythos tacos.  Too bad they come with the very bland, over-mayo-ey Potato Salad.  The Small Ravioli plate was described by one friend as \\"meh - 2 stars.\\"  The Burger looked good, but the SWEET POTATO WAFFLE FRIES WERE THE BEST.

I was honestly expecting a let down because of the hype, but to my surprise the burger WAS actually one of the best I've ever had. Big and juicy patty, very tasty bun, and the toppings (bacon, onion, cheese, pickle sauce?) were simple in presentation but had tons of flavor. It came with thick cut chips that blew the thing kind you get at most places away. Those topped with the homemade ketchup were a perfect match with the burger.\\n\\nThe beer list was a nice selection of imports (mostly bottled). The prices were a little higher than average for an imported selection like theirs, but can't knock it too much since that kind of selection isn't exactly common around New England.\\n\\nThe place itself is cool.

We were seated immediately on a Tuesday evening for dinner.\\n\\nThe bread they brought out was warm with a good balance of crust crispiness and soft inside, but I didn't like how the smooth bread was interrupted by random bits of whole grain. Sorry, I like my whole grain brain as much as the next gal, but this was a surprise to me! We skipped on appetizers and both ordered filet's with a lobster-baked potato (one of their current specials). The caesar salad that came out first was unevenly dressed and although my husband ate the whole bowl, I could only muster enough will power to eat about half. When our food came out, everything was piping hot, but the compliments end about there. The steak was tasteless and full of gristle (despite being a better cut of meat). I couldn't even finish all of the 6 oz cut. The lobster baked potato was heavy heavy heavy on the cheese; in fact, my husband and I started trying to pick through the melted cheese to get to lobster and potato alone. Their seasoned vegetables were a decent mix of snow peas, carrots, squash, zucchini, and broccoli but again -- tasted like vegetables I could make at home.\\n\\nWe opted not to order dessert, party because we didn't want to waste another minute. Our server was attentive but we waited for what seemed like forever before she came to bring us our check. Lastly, I am always disappointed when  an establishment that boasts free refills forgets to bring you one -- easy way to get points taken away in my opinion.\\n\\nBottom line?

The steak tasted a little burnt on the outside but was juicy, and the potato pancake (?) it came with was good.  My boyfriend absolutely loved the skewers, and I thought it was pretty good as well.  The sauce they used on it was a little sweet and went well with the peppers.  The garlic shrimp was about what you'd expect, pretty much the same as any other tapas place.  The couscous was actually my least favorite...perhaps because I was not expecting it to be sweet?  It was much mushier than I expected as well, and I mostly stayed away from it.\\n\\nFor dessert we picked the chocolate one, and what came out was basically a slice of rich semi-dark fudge.

I've had much better hospital food at Melrose-Wakefield Hospital.\\n\\nI would not recommend eating here if you're trying to conserve money or if your goal is to stop your stomach from growling after finishing your meal.

The staff was very friendly. The surroundings clean and orderly. Since this was our first time the kitchen sent us a sample of their liege waffle which was quite unexpected. I have to say it is very good. So sweet and crispy you really don't even need maple syrup. They brew their ice tea which is nice but they do add additional lemon herbs for flavoring which a traditionalist would not like. They also were not very attentive keeping the glass full...one refill and that was it. They brought water to the table but never tea after that first glass. Even half a glass more would have at least got me through the meal. The bacon waffle was wonderful. It is a sweat waffle with a mound of thick bacon chunks. I have never had chicken and waffles so we ordered that too. It was a very large serving of deep fried breaded chicken breast over a a lighter style waffle. It may have been their gluten free waffle but that doesn't make much sense mixing it with breaded chicken. The breading was highly seasoned with I believe rosemary. Overall I thought the dish flavorful but very dry. I enjoyed it but would most likely not order it again. We also ordered a daily special the Rueben Hash. The hash is wonderful with large chunks of potato including sweet potato, onion, and pastrami (giant cubes). I wasn't a fan of the sauerkraut though if I ordered again I would probably ask that this ingredient be left out. I enjoyed the flavors but the texture of the sauerkraut didn't mix well for me.

Received a message via Yelp from Olive & June's Dir. of Ops who took my gripes to heart, investigated, confirmed and then apologized + offered a meal on the house to make amends.  A complete A-plus in class and coolness from Olive & June. Way to go & thx!\\n\\n----  \\n\\n\\nSad date night at Olive & June...went there last night (8/31) and while we expected some level of service drop due to a Sunday night on a holiday weekend, the actual experience was just plain bad.  \\n\\nHad to wait 20 minutes even though we had a reservation for 8:45pm (no biggie) and went to the bar.  The bartender was horrendously bad...threw down the menus, no hello, not even a smile = strike one.  When the hostess came to get us, it took us 10 minutes to close our tab and the bar was only 1/2 full.  Our bartender was too engaged with other wait staff to care. We placed a credit card in their magical red glass bill holder as soon as he set it down and he just looked at it and walked away.  Rude, especially to the poor hostess that had to sit there and wait right along with us.  What surprised me even more is that the hostess, seeing all of this, just didn't offer to add the tab to our bill so we could get to our table, but okay...strike two.  \\n\\nAs for dinner, the food was the only reason I didn't give this review a one star while the service continued to be an issue.  Let's start with the food, the only bright spot in the evening.  The small plates were amazing (as usual).  Arincini, pork meatballs, farm egg & beet salad were all killer.  Small plates, nicely done, great presentation and just plain tasty.  The main courses were nice, but mine (NY strip) was heavily over-salted while my wife's quail was a pleasant surprise with a citrus garnish.  Now here's the weird thing...we ordered a side of snap peas and were brought out green beans.  When we pointed this out to the waiter when he came to check on us after the dishes were placed, his response was thus...\\"Yeah, sometimes when the kitchen runs out of snap peas, they replace them with green beans.\\"  He offered to get us another dish, but the beans were fine.  It would have been nice to know they were out of snap peas ahead of time and asked us what we would have liked then, but as the dinners are already served, we really didn't want to wait another ten minutes for a different side to arrive.  That was just weird and showed no coordination in the ranks of the front of the house staff.  \\n\\nFinally, the service at dinner was not bad but is wasn't good either.  Examples include; After ordering small plates, we were going to order pasta and then main courses.  I asked the waiter as we were ordering round two what time the kitchen closed as it was just after 10pm and he looks at the clock in the kitchen (visible through the glass into the work area) and says, \\"Oh, they closed at 10, but I can plate out dishes if you'd like.\\"  #1)  It would have been nice to have the waiter say at 9:45pm, \\"Hey - the kitchen is closing in 15, would you like to place your orders now?\\"  You know - restaurant courtesy, esp. as we were taking our time, you know, like on a date night when you're not in a hurry.  #2)  Who wants a $36 steak that's been under a warmer for 30 minutes...ah, no thanks.  We skipped right to the main courses = loss of $ to the server and restaurant and unhappy diners.  Finally, the water service was horrible...thanks to the salty steak, I needed some water, but towards the end, the waiter was no wear to be found.  Geez - thanks man.    \\n\\nA couple of other observations from the night.  As we were eating our main course, the parking valet came through and handed back keys as he was closing shop for the night.  Again, no biggie, except for the fact that when we parked, he never gave tickets, and it appeared that he hadn't given tickets to anyone else either, so he just had a hand full of keys and was asking people to pick up theirs.  Ummmmm, maybe tonight I'll take that Jaguar I've always wanted.  That was just plain unprofessional and risky.  In addition, a table next to us was seated about 20 minutes after us and they ordered dirty martinis.  They were served neat martinis.  When the guy at the table asked for more olives & olive juice, he was informed that they were out of olives...to which he replied, \\"What's the name of your restaurant?\\"  Best line of the night and that just about sums up our experience there.\\n\\nNow granted, one night does not represent a restaurant, and we've had 5-star experiences here before, but the service was so exceptionally bad last night that I just had to type this rant.  While the back of the house continues to make amazing good food, that magic is easily destroyed when the front of the house is disorganized or as we saw last night, appeared not to give a care.\\n\\nHope they fix that ASAP because we like this place and want to see it stay i"},{"name":"The Chubby Chickpea","address":"588 Washington St","city":"Canton","stars":"3.5","text":"Just finished their Schwarma sandwich (that was the size of a giant torpedo!!) which was DELISH...Ample meat ( lamb/beef) combined with diced tomatoes and cucumbers in an incredible tahini sauce...I hated for it to end!!!..

That is the only conclusion I can draw after our recent visit. I'll describe two of the indications we experienced. First, we ordered nachos. The nachos are arranged in a pyramid shape. The ones we received? The entire interior was composed of the crushed dregs of chips from the bottom of the barrel, each chip no more than 1-inch square, and most much smaller. This pyramid of fragments was then covered with one layer of whole chips. Think about that for a minute. Someone in the kitchen took real time and effort to create that travesty, stacking the little bits, then carefully laying whole chips over top to conceal the fragments. But only enough to conceal. Not one whole chip more than necessary. Now you're beginning to understand my opening sentence.\\n\\nSecond, when a person pays in cash, Centro gives back change in bills only, no coins. The problem? Centro rounds down the change in its favor, taking a patron's money without permission. In our case, Centro kept 97 cents of our money. 97 cents isn't much in the general scheme of things, but it's the principle I'm talking about. Centro stole our money. The place steals money from everyone who pays cash. Plenty of places return change in bills only, but they always round in the customer's favor. Not Centro. Why? See the opening sentence.\\n\\nAs for the quality of the food. Not good. I'm not understanding how this place has a 4 star composite rating. The nachos were odd. The chorizo (a $3 upcharge) was almost non-existent (see the opening sentence), and what little we could find had a weird sweetishness to it. Not good, and not like any other chorizo I've ever had. There was barely a drizzle of cheese sauce on the nachos, and the guacamole had started to turn brown. Ick. We also ordered huevos rancheros. Also not good. The tortilla was cold, dry, and stale. On top of it was layered frozen shredded hashbrowns that had been thawed, but not cooked or seasoned in any way. Simply room temperature, moist, bland potato shreds. The egg on top hadn't been cooked. I love a runny yolk, but the white was still mostly transparent, and the entire egg was cold. The salsa was watery, and had no flavor other than heat. A truly unpleasant plate of food. And the \\"picadillo\\" emapanada was filled with ground beef, but not ground beef prepared in the picadillo style. It came with the same watery, flavorless salsa as the huevos rancheros, along with a little pile of completely undressed, unseasoned shredded cabbage. And the entire empanada was cold.\\n\\nPrices are way too high for the quality and quantity of food received.\\n\\nThe only decent parts of the meal were the margarita and the red sangria. They tasted good, and the quantity was decent.\\n\\nService wasn't good. The place was maybe 1/3 full, but we waited a half hour (no exaggeration) before receiving our drinks. They came after we had received our food at the 25 minute mark.\\n\\nThis is one of those places that I never understand. The kind that does a brisk business, somehow having convinced many people that it is a trendy, cool place to go, and yet the food isn't good, service isn't good, and the whole vibe is somewhat unpleasant.

This place is in my neighborhood.  I love Italian cuisine and really wanted to like it.  A friend of mine took me here 6 months ago, raving about how great the food was.  After ordering the white pizza, she asked me what I thought.  I told here that I wouldn't pay the exorbitant prices for their mediocre quality of food.\\n\\nThe second time I went was last night.  It a nasty evening weather wise, with snow/rain/slush.  I decided to bring something home on the way home from work and give Amelia's another try.  After perusing the menu, I picked something remotely affordable - a \\"small\\" calzone (I really the American habit of serving meals in restaurants 2 to 3 times bigger than they should be so they can charge more money).  It ended up being 2' long and costing over $10. I 've never paid that much for a calzone in my life.  And they charged me tax on a take-out item.  You can pick two fillings.  I chose onion and eggplant.  The eggplant was a big mistake.  When it is done right, it is succulent, melt in your mouth, buttery.  When it is done badly, it is horrible.  There is no \\"in between.\\"  Needless to say, the eggplant in my calzone had the texture and taste of mattress stuffing.  It was dry, not sliced thinly enough and they didn't even take the skin off.  The service wasn't great either.  There were two tables of people who had already been served their food when I walked in.  Imagine my surprise after waiting for 20 minutes after I put my order in, that one of the kitchen staff came up to me to ask me if I wanted the sauce inside the calzone or on the side.

My fish was served on a mountain of soft red bell peppers and crispy pineapple then topped with guacamole. The wahoo itself was JUST seared with the mauve insides still fresh and barely warm.

While it was a little more rare than straight up medium,  we loved how tender it was, so neither of us had reason to complain. He loved the cumin crust and the sauce on top. The cornbread, however, was probably my favorite part. It was filled with fresh bursts of sweet corn and the bread itself was smooth and not coarse like southern-style cornbread. It threw us off at first, but the unexpected textures are great. The dish was also served with a heaping pile of garlicky kale. I have tried so many times to cook kale just like this and I always either burn the garlic or undercook the greens.

Good for a date location or a refined night with the homies, I'd come back here. Good portions, good prices, overall tasty food, even if the server probably didn't know the difference between a fork and a popsicle.\\n\\nThe long:\\nI've been to several Tapas places, in Chicago, LA and now Boston. This is not standing out as amazing, but it is definitely good. I didn't experience anything that really blew my socks off, and the stuff that let me down wasn't too big a deal for me. I got a coupon from Groupon or something that was $30 for $15 and this seemed like a better reviewed and more classy place than most that advertise on Groupon.\\n\\nSo I don't remember each dish I ordered, because in order to make $30 we had to order like 6. And the two of us were more than stuffed, which speaks to the portion size. This is not some cheap ass Tapas place that gives you a bread crumb and drizzles raspberry sauce and calls it a plate. Every portion here was generous for 2, passable for 4. And they pretty much all were between $5-$7 maybe a couple above if it was something special. 6 dishes + a tea came to $39 + tip which is pretty good for the quality, quantity, and location.\\n\\nI'll start with the bad. Why not 5? The most glaring disappointment was the specials. They have specials which rotate for like 2-3 days according to the menu. We ordered all 3 for our night, they were like $5 each. It was a red lettuce salad (5 stars) and a sasuage+cheese shell (4-5 stars) and a lentils and ham soup (2 stars max). The lettuce was fresh, had some dried cranberries, some duck, and a good vinaigrette, great appetizer, good portion. The shell (there's a name for the actual dish but I can't remember) had flavorful cheese and sausage without feeling greasy or salty. But the lentil soup literally tasted like Campbell's Pork and Beans. I felt there was ketchup flavoring, the lentils were soft, and just overall a big letdown. Also taking away from the 5 star was that the waiter was pretty lousy. He tried to be polite, but he was pretty rough, not familiar with the menu, didn't know how to pronounce most of the food, and didn't have any idea what the tea selections were. He seemed like maybe a college sophomore or junior. So like I said, rough, not a jerk, but I can't give a noob who did a poor job 5 stars. He was attentive, came around a few times, and filled our water and served well, so no detractions from the experience. But easy room for improvement.\\n\\nNow let me tell you why I wish I could give it 5 stars. Besides the appetizer specials, we ordered 2 seared tuna plates (one cold, one hot) and a mussels plate. All three were really great, especially for the price. Each dish cost like $6-7, and like I said above easily portioned for 2, maybe even for 4. The cold seared tuna plate had a zesty flavor that was a good surprise to me, the fish was firm with mostly nice red inside the evenly seared edge, and the bean medley was refreshing. The warm tuna had a rich flavor. Each tuna dish had 4 pieces of tuna probably 1/4\\" thick. The mussels plate featured probably 16-20 smallish mussels. OK, so I wish they were monster grand-daddy mussels, but for the price and the type of restaurant, I'm very happy. If this were a seafood restaurant eating them raw, I'd be disappointed. But the mussels were all open (alive when cooked which is good), good quantity (16-20), and the red garlic sauce was perfectly matched to the taste.\\n\\nWe got there like 6:45 on Friday night, and took one of the last tables. By 7:30 about a dozen people were waiting in line. So come a bit early. The bar seemed cool (we don't drink) but people were happy and not looking at their drinks wondering what was in them. Only improvement to the restaurant design I'd make is have the doors close quicker, cuz each time someone walked in the two doors, they each took so long to close (air spring too strong) that there were a good 15 seconds of cold air. This change will help their heating bill as well as their customer experience.\\n\\nI didn't use their bathroom so no comment, but my friend made no mention of it so I assume that at least the ladies' room is reasonable.\\n\\nBottom line: for an enjoyable, probably dependable tapas experience take a date here for an inexpensive but classy first-date experience. Stick to the main menu for best results, and come early to avoid the crowd. I'll definitely come back."},{"name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","address":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"The CBC is great for an after- or before-movie beer and snack.

This one fit the bill nicely.  They have different flavored broths for the hot pot (I tried Tom Yum.. not as flavorful as I'd of liked).  I had the prime rib eye and it was pretty darn good.  Kimchi appetizer (nothing special, just kimchi).  I got a few sides also, assorted mushrooms (not worth it unless you're REALLY a mushroom fan) and the baby bok choy (TOTALLY worth it).  You get a basket of veggies and some spices to doctor up the broth.  Very filling meal and well worth the price.  One of the servers and I got to talking and he brought out another piece of meat for me to try (can't remember what it was) after I was done and showed me how to just barely cook the meat (just as it's about to turn color) and a sesame sauce to dip it in.  Gotta say thanks to him because I've been just letting the meat stew in the broth for minutes.  He dipped this piece in for barely 10-15 seconds and had me dip it in the sauce and eat it whole.  Notes for next time!  If you're going for the hot pot they really don't have single tables, so if you go solo like I did you'll be sharing a table with others.

My first experience at Lure started (and stayed) at the bar. I'm big on comfort and I was torn by these bar stools. They are, in fact, quite comfy...cushioned seat and back. And they swivel! (don't pretend like you're not excited by that) But they are bolted to the floor. I'm not one for restraint and it'd be nice to be able to move closer/farther away from your bar neighbor. And the swivel to leave the bar can prove tricky, just sayin. Too much about the stools, sorry. If you've seen the size of the front patio, the interior is about the same size. The seating inside is fairly limited and the awkwardly proportioned stools in the dining area appear as if they're awaiting a booster seat. Strange. The kitchen is viewable through a high wall cut out, which I always like. Fun to peak back there. \\n\\nI had great service at the bar and once they started to fill up it was lively, but not crazy. They have some good beers on draft and a handful of specialty cocktails. They also do 'punch bowls' which come out for you to serve to the table. It's a clever idea and I would be curious to see how far a \\"serves 2-4\\" bowl really goes for $40. I'm thinking I might be able to knock back that bowl alone, not sure it's worth it, but love the idea nonetheless. Also a nice wine list. The entrees are pretty pricey, but they offer a lot of smaller plates good for sharing...although those can add up pretty fast. \\n\\nI enjoyed trying Lure, but I don't have a deep enough wallet to eat here a lot.

If you like an equal dough-to-chocolate chip ratio then these aren't for you, but they also offer several other kinds that rotate.

Other posters mentioned a scantily clad wait staff but all we saw working were confused dudes.\\n\\nInside, it is all concrete flooring which is nice, separated by 2 rooms. The first being a closed in room with no windows and rows of granite top sit down tables. I couldn't quite figure out what they were going for here. Think very sleek McDonalds seating area in an old strip club. The other room was a bar area with a nice bar and stand up granite top tables. It looked more like a European cafe/bar collided with a local dive. If a bar could have a mullet, this was it. Clean and organized with granite tables when you walk in, followed by a pool table and a wall of arcade games.\\n\\nI guess if you read the menu, which shouldn't take long since there are only 7 items, it says 'Sports Bar'. I'm not sure they grasp the concept of 'Sports Bar', being there are only 2 small TV's behind the bar and a max 2 TV's from any viewing angle. My favorite part however was that the speakers blasted a sad documentary on ESPNU while a tied Mav's game was going into the final minutes on the other TV.\\n\\nI'm not sure it can be classified as a full service restaurant either. Most of the 7 items (2 of which had been 86'd) were some form of gyro and one was a burger, basically equivalent to a Greek food truck. I can't really tell you how the food tasted because I finished 2 beers and left before it arrived. I'm sure the gyros were amazing since they took over an hour to come out of the kitchen.\\n\\nI would go out on limb and say it's just your average bar but the beer menu was straight out of any cooler on a float trip down the Guadalupe. There was no draft and 8 versions of Bud Light/Corona tasting beer with Heineken, Shiner and a Greek beer being the only 'upscale' choices. Before going through all 11 choices, I asked for the Austin staple, Fireman's 4, to which our waiter replied, \\"what's that\\".\\n\\nOn the bright side, the patio looked very nice and there is an upstairs deck which looked promising. Beware though, after texting my friend about this place, he said they tried to come here to watch a football game and the bar was charging $5 to be seated upstairs.\\n\\nMaybe my expectations were too high. I was hoping to find something comparable to Tino's closer to home or maybe even a new sports bar but this place drastically misses the boat on everything.\\n\\nIf I were you, I'd stick to the Greek food trailer on Rainey and carry it across the street to Bar96."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Love Stephanies!

Heck, everyone does now. However, what makes Renata's pasta so noteworthy is the amazing complexity they bring to each plate. Not only are they mixing proteins, adding unique pairing elements -they are also working with \\"old world\\" pasta making styles that you won't find anywhere else.\\n\\nThe salads were decent - but not anything spectacular. The meat plate was fantastic. They make all of their won charcuetiere and it is so obvious. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is really unique.

A+ for that.  \\n\\nAlthough it would not be the first stop for food when I am in the area, I would give them another try in regards to sandwiches or burgers.

I also ended up putting more Parmesan cheese, spinach, and fresh tomato on it. \\n\\nHonestly, it was all very good - and very filling. All of the vegetables are fresh and seasonal and the work area is sparkly clean. Their sauces are delicious and I am impressed with their cheese offerings. There is lots of variety in the toppings, but none in the way of entrees - hmmm.\\n\\nFrom the appetizer's I've tried, the calamari and the dip, both were pretty decent.

It's only been open a few months, but I've already been 4 times even though I don't even live near campus anymore.  I've also taken advantage of the Groupon ($11 for $20 off for 2 people or $22 for $40 off for 4 people or more), which knocks off quite a bit off the final price.  Their recent All You Can Eat option is a great way to get rid of meats that haven't been used but their expiration dates are coming up, because it's a win-win for everyone!  The only reason why I can't rate this higher is because of the service.  The trouble with hiring college students to work here (although understandably convenient for a restaurant open right on campus) is that the service is slow and the servers are not knowledgeable or responsive at all.  A better hiring process should be enacted, with higher standards for training for sure.

The ingredients were not evenly distributed along the wrap.  The wrap also includes cheese but the hostess forgot to mention the have cheddar.  :(\\n\\nThat sounds like a two-star description, but wait- it gets better!  The vegetables were very fresh and crunchy.  So even though the wrap wasn't what I expected, it was still really good.  The wrap was not drowning in dressing.  There was just the right amount to have the extra flavor in each bite, but keep the vegetables crunchy.  When I ordered a wrap, the hostess offered white or wheat without my having to request whole wheat.\\n\\nI came into the restaurant in a hurry and in a really bad mood.  I was a bit annoyed about not getting cheddar and only having \\"rabbit food\\" in the wrap.

Had I not been in a frustrated hurry, I probably could have inspected the menu, asked questions, and ultimately got something I wanted more than a lettuce wrap.  \\n\\nFinding a healthy option was easy, especially since the hostess volunteered the whole wheat option for the wrap.

Come for the cheese cart.\\n\\nI'm so serious here, I don't even consider this a steak place in my mind, and to me, it is always known as that 'one really good cheese place.' If you love cheese, the cheese cart here is so amazing. You get to pick from about 12-14 cheeses out of the cart (you get 3 or 6 picks depending on the size you choose) and it comes with almonds, dates, honey, and bread.\\n\\nThe cheeses rotate in and out - so you'll usually get a new pick. They seem to always have Midnight Moon (a delicious goat cheese I always love).  You will have a variety of cheeses to pick from and they explain each one really well. I suggest going with a good variety - a few soft, a few hard, and definitely a blue to go with the honey.\\n\\nTheir sides are also pretty good - I'm a fan of coming for cheese and side dishes. The french onion soup is OK - it's good, but not great. The cheese isn't great, and the broth is a little too sweet for me. It also has 3 slices of baguette in it that get really soggy and soak up too much broth. It could use 1/3rd of the bread it has in it.\\n\\nWe tried a new dish, the pan seared gnudi, which are delicious little ricotta dumpling-like deals (similar to gnocchi). \\n\\nI've tried their steaks, and they are nothing special - definitely over priced as well. I strongly suggest coming for their other dishes!"},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"It's only redeeming quality is the wonderful street view.

I was really not impressed with our waitress. I was with a group of people from work and we sat at our table for at least 10 minutes before the waitress came by. From that moment on, it was one disappointment after another. She took drink orders from one person at the table and took off. When she came back with it, I asked if I was able to get something to drink too (!?). She took a really long time to get the drink to the table. Next, we waited a long time for our food. I ordered a guacamole appetizer, my coworkers ordered entrees. When we finally got our food, she gave my guacamole to someone else at my table. We didn't realize, thought she was coming back with mine. My coworker used the guacamole on his entree because we thought it came with his food. When we asked her where my guacamole appetizer was and she realized her mistake, she laughed and acted like, \\"oh well\\", and walked off! She didn't even offer to bring me a new one! I couldn't believe it! I had to settle with what was left of the one my coworker had used on his tacos. I thought that was completely rude of the waitress. I probably will not go back to this place and it's too bad for the owners of this restaurant because I can only imagine this waitress has pissed off other customers. To sum it up: very long wait times in between getting there, getting food, and if you think you are getting refills or another drink- think again.

It was an o-k type of good, but it wasn't like an explosion of flava in my mouth good...but, let's be real, I didn't expect a food orgasm since this is supposed to be British food after all (my expectations were low).

The cashier brought out my food and even brought my friend a bowl of water...100 cool points for that.  ;-)  The atmosphere is laid back, tables and couches.  I could see myself hanging out here some mornings having a cup of joe and typing away on the laptop or reading a good book. \\n\\nPrice: Now here is where I have a problem.  A breakfast sandwich, cup of coffee, and a dollar tip (and some change) cost me $12 bucks! I think the sandwich itself was like $8+dollars, and the cashier mentioned that I would need a fork to finish the sandwich, the sandwich was not that big and a fork is not really needed. This is more than what I usually pay for breakfast and in my opinion, this is too pricey.  I suspect that the price is higher due to those quality ingredients they speak about on their website.  Let me say, I respect quality ingredients, but like I mentioned under \\"Food\\", those ingredients didn't make for a superior taste sandwich.  Also, I can get damn good breakfast tacos for like $1-2 dollars in the 45, so I'll always keep that in mind when choosing between Full E or others. \\n\\nSummary: I'll come back to this place occassionally because I still want to try out the other items on their menu and I did enjoy the service and the atmosphere."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I've been here once for dinner and several times for brunch.

If you want the thick marinated thicker pieces of meat you'll have to go to places that charge by weight. \\n\\nThe way I like to make my bowl is add the meat first, add the sauces, add the vegetables (poke some in the holes that the meat slices create), push down on the veggies to squish down the meat, add noodles and spinach on top. \\n\\nI love that you have full freedom to make your bowl however you like. The food tastes great and the price is definitely right. For $6.99 you can afford to go try it and risk not liking it. But I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If not, you're probably the one to blame since you control your final product :P"},{"name":"Toji Korean Grill House","address":"4615 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Reasonable price, great parking, service is good, and the food is great...

They made their name & reputation through their waffles.\\n\\nOur party of six was seated quickly, but it took FOREVER before our meals were served ... I mean a much longer time than acceptable but thankfully we didn't have any young children with us.  \\n\\nOnce your order is placed they present the table with a small sampling of their famous waffles.   The popular li√®ge style waffle is made from a sweet brioche-style dough (not a batter) with big chunks of pearl sugar kneaded into the dough before baking and topped with vanilla powdered sugar.  The pearl sugar is imported from Belgium to ensure the most authentic Liege style possible.  They do not serve syrup with this waffle as it's supposed to be sweet enough without it.\\n\\nI had the Housemade Corned Beef Hash made with peppers, onions and horseradish cream, house potatoes and two eggs over easy ($12).  It was very average with large chunks of green/red/yellow peppers which should have been cooked longer to infuse the flavors.  It needed more horseradish cream and the house potatoes (regular and sweet) had a nice spice, but could have been a bit more crisp to give some texture to the dish.  The over easy eggs were cooked perfectly.\\n\\nFour people had the scrambles.  Two had the Arugula, Bacon, Chevre Scramble with arugula, bacon and crumbled chevre ($11) and two had the blackboard special Smoked Salmon Scramble which was, I think, the best dish of all.  I don't recall the pricing but the flavors made it a real value at any price.  All scrambles were served with saut√©ed spinach which was so salty you couldn't eat it.\\n \\nThe last dish was a Creamy polenta breakfast with saut√©ed mushrooms, saut√©ed green spinach, and chevre topped with two eggs ($9).  We requested only one egg, and were served one egg, but there wasn't any adjustment in the pricing.  A dollar off would have been appreciated.\\n\\nCoffee is priced at $2.50 and they were constantly refilling the mugs.  Coffee was just OK.  The one strange thing was when we requested maple syrup.  They tried to talk us out of it saying the waffles were sweet enough without syrup and should be eaten 'dry'.  When we insisted, they said maple syrup was $2 or they could serve non-maple syrup for free.  It was quite the discussion.\\n\\nOur server was great and he made paying the bill very easy.  I think he was the highlight of the breakfast as he was also entertaining.\\n\\nOverall, I think this breakfast spot is over rated, but they do have some interesting dishes.  Gigi's just needs to iron out some of their offerings, improve the consistency of the dishes, and figure out how to improve the timing from the kitchen...and don't make people feel bad about ordering syrup for their waffles!"},{"name":"Bon Baguette","address":"13500 SW Pacific Hwy, Ste 92","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"I reviewed Bon Baguette before and gave them five stars!! The staff change has not been pleasant. The new gal working is just not kind. It is the only restaurant I have been to where I was told I am too busy to get soy sauce from the back or I am too busy to take your phone order or when you walk in she is too busy to take your order in person. They must be a really good position to turn paying customers away.

I went with a few friends last weekend to dine at Mrs. B's, and it might have been the WORST experience I have ever had.  I will say that the food was still quite good, but the list of problems is long and storied.\\n\\nBefore I get to the problems, let me tell you what's improved since my last visit: there is a wine list.  Finally.  However, nowhere is beer listed and the servers seem fully unaware of what is served.\\n\\nNow, on to how it went terribly, terribly wrong.  First, it took more than thirty minutes to get our drinks.  Our FIRST round of drinks, which was our only round since we weren't there for three hours.  The restaurant was not crowded, and we ordered beer and wine (nothing complex).  Next, one of the pieces of cornbread that came out wasn't cooked all the way and was hard as a rock where it was cooked.\\n\\nAnd the music, oh gods, the music.  There was a drummer and an organist playing and boy was it LOUD.  It was so loud we were having to yell to chat at our tables.  Unacceptably loud.  I had to complain to the waitress, which of course, accomplished nothing.\\n\\nThen, it took another 20 minutes for our waitress to ask if we needed food.  Forget appetizers at this point, we went straight for the main courses.  Once she finally did, we couldn't hear her (and she couldn't hear us) - we had to ask her three times for the specials (she didn't volunteer them).\\n\\nThis kitchen seems to have a real problem using salt.  It seems everything is unsalted here - the butter, the cornbread, the veggies, the gumbo, the jambalya, EVERYTHING.  For $15/plate, I shouldn't be salting everything.  It's just.. annoying.\\n\\nWhy oh WHY can restaurants in Austin not WASH THE FUCKING GREENS IN A FUCKING SALAD??  Pesticides and preservatives were all I could taste, even through the balsamic vinaigrette dressing.\\n\\nFinally, when the food did come out, my piece of snapper (I ordered the blackened red snapper) was about two fingers wide and a half a hand long.  For $15.99, I got about three ounces of snapper.  What.  The. Fuck.  Snapper just isn't that expensive.\\n\\n\\nSo what's it come down to this time?  If the food didn't TASTE so damn good, I'd tell you to NEVER patronize this establishment.  The prices are just too high to deal with the HUGE service problems, the overwhelming music, and the small portions.  But the food is just too damn good.\\n\\nSo that's your saving grace, Mrs. B.  The food is tasty, and despite the horrendous service, the unwashed greens, and the ridiculously tiny portions, I won't issue a blanket \\"Don't Eat Here\\" ban.  But my business will be VERY rare, and I will ensure that EVERYONE I know is aware of why."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Parking in newbury is impossible as usual, especially on weekends. There are seating outside, but on a nice summer day, it was all taken. I didnt mind that much bc the booths inside are much more comfortable. We missed the brunch time (ends at 3pm). The bloody mary is still available to be ordered but not customizable. It came with olives, celery and salt. $1 more for bacon. \\nI got the lobster roll. It was good and buttery. The roll was toasted which added a nice flavor, but mine was a little overdone. \\n\\nThe place is quite pricey but the portion was generous.
