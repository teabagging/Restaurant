The airport has a massive area pre security that has plenty of options for food and booze but we wanted to remove the stress of security. After over 30 minutes in the security que we got to Airside 2 only to find it under construction and the only place that has food and booze is Johnny's. Well 99% of the travelers had the same idea so there was no place to sit. After a long wait ( btw , hey traveler guy that is drinking a soda and looking at his laptop with his bags on another seat and not ordering food, how about going to your gate and letting somebody that is going to drink and eat have a place to sit?) we were seated. Why couldn't the airport put up a sign pre security that warned us of this? The servers at Johnny's did the best they could to seat us and they were FANTASTIC! Once seated we shared a table with a guy from Stockton who had a beer and a shot and then a guy from New Orleans. Talking with them was quite fun so there was an upside to the busyness. Being from California I was very excited to enjoy Yuengling on tap. The food was very average. Ordered the Smoked Pulled Pork Hoagie with cornbread and cole slaw.

There are several other spots in town that offer brisket, ribs and sausage just as good without the 2 1/2 hour wait. I decided to make the pilgrimage and wait in line for two reasons: I've lived in Austin for a while and have never tried the most infamous smoked meats in town. And I had a buddy in town from Seattle, so he was all about doing the whole wait-in-line-like-a-tourist spiel. Again, the food -- and even the service -- was really good.

I would never, everever wait in line in Austin Texas for BBQ. NEVER. EVER.\\n\\nSo, my company booked the whole joint for the evening and invited 50 of our closest friends (okay, they were clients we wanted to impress!) for some famous Franklin BBQ and beer. \\n\\nIt was (insert your most yummy, insane adjective here) delicious. They have a flat rate to book the place for the night, but like anything else with Franklin, the dates are hard to come by. (We booked our night over 2 months out) But it is totally worth it. The package rate includes all the beer, and everyone goes thru  the line. If there is food left after (they cook for like 50-60) then you can go thru again. AND the price includes the yummy little pies from Cake & Spoon. \\n\\nWe ate until we were sick, drank better than we thought they would have beer (they had Fireman's 4, which is my fave) and actually went home with big packages of leftover meat. \\n\\nPulled pork was to die for, brisket tastes like really really great smoked prime rib, and the pork ribs, turkey and sausage are pretty good too. (Although if the review was based solely on the ribs, turkey and sausage, it would only be a 3 or 4 star.) \\n\\nI must say, I did not even try the coleslaw or the sauces they offer (meat was good enough without it) and I had just a bite of potato salad. Sides are NOT what you go to Franklin for, but the potato salad was okay, nothing spectacular. \\n\\nHubby and I ate leftovers for the next 3 days until we were LITERALLY sick. But, I gotta tell ya, I'll definitely re-think that standing in line thing now. Or maybe call in to get their equally hard to get 'to go' orders. \\n\\nAs you well know from every other stinkin review ever written about this place, , delish and depending on your personal preference, worth the long wait in line. \\n\\nOH, and since ours was a 'catering'  type deal, I must mention that Stacy and Benji were just great to work with before the event, and the staff their that night was amazeballs.

So i get the manager on the phone and she says sorry we don't have fancy heat bags like the rest of the pizza places like papa ginos so when we send our drivers out we send them out with 4-5 stops and if your the last stop well your food might not be hot, so here is $6 to your order, again WTF?!?!?! for a two hour wait, warm food, and a rude person on the phone i $6 back on a $28 order, we will NEVER order from here again!!!!

This place was magical. \\n\\nOn a recent trip to Portland, some friends of our recommended we give this place a try. We were surprised at the line outside the door prior to opening, but figured that was a good sign. It was. We were seated and our server arrived promptly to our table. It was clear that she had been double (or maybe even triple) seated, but she was very professional and kept her cool. Not once during our meal did we feel rushed despite her full section.\\n\\nWe started with the hushpuppies. They were so fresh that we all burned our tongues. But they were so good, that it was worth continuing to scald our mouthes to eat them as fast as possible. \\n\\nMy friend's husband and i both got the shrimp and grits. The grits were not great (a little bland if we're being honest), but the shrimp was cooked to perfection. My husband and my friend both got the fried chicken. Let me begin to gush. The chicken was so moist and the breading just enough. They're known for the fried chicken, so we figured it would be great. But for us, the thing that really knocked our socks off was the mac and cheese. Let me repeat: the mac and cheese is orgasmic. The perfect amount of seasoning and creaminess, with a little bit of crisp on top. We were not worthy of such a perfect cup of cheesy goodness..... \\n\\nThe desserts were fantastic.

Although many friends have recommended going here for breakfast/brunch, my GF and I decided to go for dinner in our pursuit of their famous fried chicken. Thankfully we only waited about 20 min.\\n\\nUpon entry, the place felt/looked very warm and homey and the staff was so friendly. We shared the crispy fried buttermilk-battered chicken and a side of their crispy fried wings. Oh man! How?! Once the food arrived we thought we were ready, but our taste buds certainly weren't. That very first bite was so good I could feel the southern soul taking over. And once I dipped a bite into the tasso ham gravy I just wanted to melt. Keep in mind, this is just the white meat, so when I tried the chicken thigh OMG it was just pure bliss!  They somehow figured out how to make the chicken breast JUST AS JUICY as the dark meat. INSANE! And the chicken is seasoned and fried perfectly without too much batter while still being deliciously crispy. Definitely up there (with Howlin' Rays) in terms of best fried chicken I've ever had! \\n\\nNow the wings are a whole other story. These bad boys are SMOKED FIRST and then fried! The flavor is truly incredible. It's like nothing I've ever tasted in fried chicken. The fried chicken alone is UTTERLY AMAZING! My only problem is that I like some heat, but thankfully they have hot sauce. I can't wait to come back to try their Braised Pork Shoulder and the Mac n Cheese.

This lack of empathy will catch up with the IVG business and their nation wide affiliated businesses one day as more people speak out, Yes, they are a money making enterprise with many locations in the US and four being located in Massachusetts.. I have told my negative experience to my friends and family and wish to share with everyone that IVG really cares about their bottom line as they are a business that preys on people's emotions. The CEO for the IVG locations in Massachusetts has received praise for his high $$$$$$ bottom line figure from his affiliates, good job : ) It's really sickening but true as I have come to experience. My Mastiff puppy had a $2850.00 eye surgery there and developed two staff infection. One staff infection is mostly found on medical equipment or in hospitals. I can't say that my puppy picked up that infection at IVG but it occurred right after surgery and he doesn't hang out at hospitals..... who knows?  I just wanted care for my puppy and his eye conditions as he needs additional eye surgery.... I will not blame anyone but my puppy is still sick and being denied any treatment now or in the future at IVG for no reason other that I spoke out to advocate for my dog in a pleasant way.  When I went in for an appointment I was meet by the business manager who made me feel extremely uncomfortably and she told me to bring my puppy some where else for treatment and I was not allowed in the building. Could this be because I asked on the phone before I came in for my appointment if any other dogs had gotten these two staph infections? Oh, the horror!!!! I am concerned for other animals and wanted just to tell IVG what happened to my puppy and to make sure other dogs didn't get infected . IVG may think it's wrong to advocate for the well being of my dog and other pets as it doesn't fit into their business model. I don't know why else they gave me the heave-ho treatment as I have spent thousands of $$ on my dogs there.

Lets' start at the top and rate:\\nBrisket - Unreal...best brisket I've had.  Overall product is great and super moist from the flat to the point.  The nature brisket that Aaron uses is where it's at for sure.\\nRibs - Taste great, but were a little over cooked that last couple times.  Overall they are good.\\nPulled Pork - Fantastic.  The 3 sauces Aaron has available are great.  The espresso bbq is out of this world good. I've actually got the recipe and still can't replicate it exactly.  \\nTurkey - Really good, but was a little dry the last time we were there.  The overall favor is great and my wife loved it.  That was the first time she'd had it from Aaron. \\nSausage - It's fair.  I come to Franklin for the brisket mainly so I am not really partial to the sausage here, but it's okay.  \\nThe Tipsy Texan - Great sandwich.  Has all the flavor and power of Franklin BBQ in one all-inclusive product.  Highly recommend this one.\\nBe sure if you want to get some BBQ here that you prepare for the true BBQ pilgrimage.  Your looking at a minimum of 2 hours to get your order.  If you have larger orders you can call in a head and would recommend that you do that if your a regular.  We do that now and pool together to get whole briskets.  There is a minimum order that is required for call in orders."},{"name":"SOJUba","address":"1265 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Thursday night dinner for 6, We were greeted and seated right away.

Security also didn't care about smoking weed apparently, so be prepared for cigarette and pot smoke. The venue outside is also in basically a dirt bowl, there is no breeze, and it is probably ten degrees hotter near the stage then anywhere else outside.  This also made the smoke just linger.

I had 3 appetizers - gnocchi, brocolli florette and the main lobster in potatoes.

The brocolli flowrette was deep fried tempera like filled with a cheese sauce with lentil like beans on the plate - this was delicious, especially if one likes tempera.  But the main lobster (which was recommended by the waiter when I asked which would be better to select - oyster, crab cakes or lobster -he suggested lobster) I was dissappointed that the avocado mashed potatoes tasted like potato flakes whipped up in the kitchen served in a nice martini glass with 4 lobster pieces on top or in the potatoes - and the potates were salty!!  The appearance of this appetizer was impressive, but I have tasted better lobster and fresh potatoes elsewhere - maybe because I am from California, I believe foods tasting fresh is important and better if organic!!!  I mentioned about the quality and saltiness of the lobster entree to 2 employees, but they just made no comment and did nothing. Did not feel that this appetizer was worth $ 21.00 and with the bill of about $ 60.00 for just appetizers, definitely not one of the better meal I had at that price.

Of course they actually came with 4 so we would have been fine with one but we ate them all anyways. :)  We also got the Tomato and Buffalo Mozzarella salad to split which was okay.  We ordered it without onions but of course it came with them so we picked them out but you could still taste them.  We should have just sent it back but didn't want to make that big of a deal about it.  \\n\\nFor dinner two of us got the Gerber Chicken that came with mac and cheese and some sort of gravy, it was really good and plates were licked clean.  Hubs got the Bye bye Miss American Pie pizza and double checked that it didn't have onions on it; our waitress assured us she would double check and not have them on the pizza.  Of course the pizza came out with the onions on there.  Again sucked it up and didn't send the pizza back bc we figured it would take too long but made sure the waitress knew her mistake.  Lastly my friend got the mustard glazed pork cooked medium.  It came out borderline medium rare to just rare so she sent it back.  Unfortunately it took a long time for her new dinner to come back and the rest of us were trying eat slowly so she wouldn't be eating alone but also didn't want our dinners to get too cold.  After 10+ minutes her dinner finally came back out and she did say it was really good.\\n\\nOnly one of us got the restaurant week menu which came with an ice cream cookie sandwich.  It was eh, the sandwich was so hard you could barely eat it.  Its not normally on the menu though but the chocolate cake looked really good.  I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but I couldn't because of the mistakes in the service.  Our waitress was sweet but she just got too many things wrong and then we didn't get anything comped on the meal and honestly didn't seem super apologetic once we informed her of the mistakes.

Bring something to read or visit with folks in line.\\nThey open at 11am and the line moves quickly. You must get brisket. You really can't go wrong with anything they make. The cole slaw and potato salad are very good complements to the meats. They are not really awesome as stand alone. The cole slaw is not too sweet or overdone with dressing. The potato salad is mustardy and has good crunch with the pickles. I am not a big pork fan, but the pulled pork sandwich with slaw, pickles, and white onions was something I didn't want to put down. I had to so I could move on to the pork ribs - they have an amazing outer crust loaded with black pepper. So tender and savory. Again, I'm not a big pork eater - it's usually too salty for my taste - but the pork here let the meat shine. The first thing I tasted was the brisket. When I put it in my mouth, everything got quiet. Despite the noise and activity all around me, my mind became very quiet and focused on what I was tasting. A spiritual calmness and feeling of reverence came over me. I grew up eating meats smoked with pecan wood which is awesome. We asked what wood they use and they said Post Oak. Franklin Barbecue is serving a 100% quality product and you can taste the dedication to crafting the best smoked meats and sides that complement them. They will ask you if you want lean or fatty cut of brisket. Out order was half and half. Both great. We also had a sausage link which was a little greasy for my taste, but it was good with bread. I grew up on a specific blend of sausage that had beef a good amount of black pepper in it, so I'm partial. There were three sauces and all were good. I didn't really need them. I'm in the camp that says if your meat is good, it doesn't need sauce. I really wanted to savor the meat, not the sauce. Beverages: soda fountain, Mexican Coke, sweet tea, unsweetened tea, variety of beers. Probably more - check the web site.\\nThey smoke 2000lbs of meat a day.

This is not the case about my experience at Franks this past Friday evening. My husband and I, who have lived in this area for about a month, were out for the day hitting some local spots for food and beverages. We were excited to try Dirty Franks because let's be honest who doesn't love a good hot dog. Anyway, we walked in and it was busy, a good sign we thought, we were having a beer so we saw an open seat at the bar and I went and sat down and my husband stood next to me. Figured that was easier and another seat would open eventually. The bartender finally walked up, no greeting and said what do you want. My husband ordered his beer, I'm not a huge beer drinker so asked a couple questions in which I was dismissed and told to just get a PBR, it'll be the only thing that I like. So I ordered a PBR and a water. Beer came, no water. A few minutes later, I got the bartenders attention, I wish I had a name but it was never offered, and I asked for some menus, he told me I couldn't order food. No follow up just that I couldn't order food, apparently I looked confused and he finally said we couldn't eat because we weren't both sitting and they won't let you eat standing up. Okay, no big deal but keep in mind I've never been here so not something I would have known and maybe making me feel like an idiot wasn't the way to go with it. So, I asked if we could at least look at a menu since it was our first time and we could look at the different dogs, I also asked for a water again. About three or four minutes later he threw a couple menus down on the bar in front of us and walked off, still no water. A handful of minutes later the guy sitting next to me at the bar finished his food and left, thus opening up a seat and my husband sat down. We were excited to order our hotdogs, the bartender walked up and simply said, \\"are you ready?\\"  We ordered our food, I again ordered a water with my food. Never asked if we had questions or anything,never put a smile on his face or anything. Our food came, a different person actually delivered the food, this person smiled when bringing the food which was a nice change. The food was mediocre but at least what we ordered. Not once were we asked if everything was good or if we needed anything. I grabbed the bartender and asked for a water again, this time I finally got it. My husband and I sat there and ate and before we even finished our food the bartender brought the check laid it in front of my husband and walked away, now the couple to our left was asked if they wanted another drink or even dessert, we got a check before our drinks and food were even gone. We paid, and honestly left a dismal tip because the service was so terrible and left. I didn't even finish my beer because I was so annoyed. I did however finish the food and water. We left there and I honestly could not wrap my head around how rude we were treated pretty much start to finish. I know people rave about how good franks is but if this is the first impression anyone else gets I feel bad for them.

So today I took my carnivorous cravings to Fox Bros BBQ to regain my manliness, rebuild my brand, and, oh, to have one helluva plate of cue.\\n\\nFox Bros started out as a catering outfit with an outpost inside Smith's Olde Bar. While those operations still exist, they now have their own stand-alone restaurant on Dekalb Avenue just east of Moreland. As soon as you park the car, you pretty much know you have come to the right place for barbecue. The building has the appearance of a roadside shack and the smells of smoked meat surround you as you make your way in the door.\\n\\nWe started with an order of sliced jalapeno \\"chips\\" (a special of the day, its literally breaded slices of jalapenos), which comes with a side of ranch sauce for dipping. The Tomminator, a mound of tater tots covered in melted cheese and Brunswick stew is a treat, although very filling (go with the  order if there you don't have a full table, because you don't want to be too full for the main course). \\n\\nThey have all the standards you would expect- pulled pork, ribs, chicken. But the real treat here is the brisket, which particularly soaks in the smoky taste from the cooking process in each bite. The outside skin of the meat can be slightly charred (I actually like this), but the inside is moist and tender. In general, this is not a place that serves their meat covered in some thick sauce that hides the true taste. Here you get pure barbecue, smoky flavor and all, with the option to add a peppery vinegar-based sauce that sits on the table. I have had numerous sides and all are first rate. The Brunswick Stew (with chunks of fatback) and the hearty baked beans particularly stand out. \\n\\nI have probably hit Fox Bros. every month or so since they opened last year and have never had a disappointing meal.

Twice, in fact, he was on his way over with food for our table when he stopped and had a few laughs with his buddies.

We ended up going on Monday at 2 and were finally able to secure a parking spot AND a table. A MIRACLE!\\n\\nIn all of our enthusiasm, we may have overdone it. We ordered half orders of the pickle chips and The Lopez for appetizers. The chili is a little too sweet for me, but the tots were cheesy, crispy and tasty. The pickle chips and ranch alone are reason enough to return. They weren't soggy like some pickle chips turn out, these were crisp, crunchy and not overly-greasy from the first to the last.\\n\\nFor appetizers we both got 3 meats. I got ribs, burnt ends and the brisket. The rib meat has sort of an off putting flavor, the burnt ends weren't at all what I was expecting. They were sauced, and although really good (and fantastic as leftovers) I was looking for something with a really good bark, and that was lost here. The brisket, my god, the brisket. By far my favorite part of the Fox Bros adventure. The bark and color, the texture....the brisket is the stuff my dreams are made of. I got mac and cheese and okra as my sides. Both were solid. Unfortunately, the okra is seasonal - and it was the last day of the season they'll be serving it up.\\n\\nMy better half got chicken, wings and burnt ends. The chicken was good, it comes with what I guess is a bbq ranch - which is forgettable. The wings were her favorite part. I had them as leftovers - cold, and they were phenomenal - so I can only imagine what they're like hot. Her sides were cole slaw (bland) and Fox-a-roni. Do NOT miss the fox-a-roni. It's their regular Mac and Cheese + Brunswick stew.

Being a BBQ snob and having sampled, no regularly eaten at, some of the best BBQ places in the world (here in central TX,) I thought that this place had to be a fad and that all of the reviews were just a part of the \\"Greater Fool Theory\\" from people who had to justify their waiting in line for 2 hours.\\n\\nWhen my buddies said that they wanted to go to Franklin BBQ, I groaned.  I have absolutely zero tolerance for waiting in line.  I criss-cross around the park at Disney World/Land to avoid lines.  I knew that this was going to be a miserable experience.\\n\\nBoy, was I wrong.  Yeah, the 2 hour wait sucked, but I assure you (and am not trying to sell this place to you, as the greater fool,) that it was absolutely worth it.  I ordered [plenty of] lean brisket, pork ribs, sausage, a big red soda, and a bourbon-banana tart.\\n\\nOf those 3 meats, the worst was the sausage.  This was a bit of a shock, since most quality BBQ places are able to knock the sausage out of the park with little effort.  The flavor of the sausage at Franklin BBQ is excellent -- it is slightly spicy; however, the casing is WAY too tough.  In fact, it was difficult to cut it with the plastic knife provided.\\n\\nThe brisket was AMAZING.  Granted, there IS a ceiling for brisket and many other quality central TX BBQ joints are also there, but the brisket at Franklin BBQ is among the best:  Mine was lean (as ordered,) but not dry.  It was wonderfully smoky-meaty flavored.  Honestly, I ate most of it without sauce -- which brings me to the sauce.  They have 3 varieties, as best as I can tell:  Their signature espresso-based sauce, a sweet vinegar-based sauce and (I think) a spicy vinegar-based sauce.  I didn't really care for any of these sauces.  The vinegar-based sauces were nothing special, and I didn't particularly care for the espresso-based sauce.  Again, the meat was so wonderfully flavored that I actually preferred to eat it without sauce (something I really have never done anywhere else.)\\n\\nThis was especially true with the pork ribs.  Of all of the pork ribs that I have tried (including some of the well-known places in Memphis,) the ribs at Franklin were, FAR AND AWAY, the best ANYWHERE.  The meat was foll-off-the-bone tender, and was perfectly seasoned.  I don't usually feel like having BBQ to have ribs, but this is one place where I am now craving ribs from.  They are THAT good.  Also worth mentioning:  I brought plenty of meat home for my family, and it reheated well.\\n\\nEverything else was fine.  As you might have noticed, I didn't even bother with sides.  The bourbon-banana tart was fine but, in the future, I'm going to skip dessert and order more ribs.\\n\\nBottom line:  Franklin BBQ is totally legit and raises the bar for BBQ in Austin.  Now there is even that much less reason to huff it down to Lockhart."},{"name":"Aji-Kura Ramen & Sushi","address":"5857 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"wow what a great tasting beef noodle/ramen.

Thankfully we were placed in line where we got to be seated with the first wave of people so we didn't have to wait again for the people to finish eating to get a seat. \\n\\nSetting: Screen Door is a decent size place that has an open seating area with tables and booths and a bar area. It felt very nice and homey. They also have outdoor patio seating.\\n\\nParking: Street parking is available. We easily found street parking since we went early and it is within a residential neighborhood. \\n\\nFood: The restaurant is known for their breakfast and brunch food and serves a wide variety of dishes such as their famous chicken and waffles, benedicts, grits, hash, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, and french toasts. You can also build your own breakfast. Their lunch menu consists of burgers, salads and sandwiches. Their cocktails include mimosas, bloody mary, apple cider, fizz and milk punch. They also have specials that are not on the menu. I didn't really know what to choose so I went with a safe choice and chose their chicken and waffles ($14.75). What makes their waffle special is that it is made out of sweet potato! My friend ordered the St. Helens Natural Beef Brisket Hash ($12.75) which included potatoes, smoked brisket, mixed peppers, sweet onions, greens and radishes topped with their delicious avocado aioli. It also comes with tortillas and two eggs any way. \\n\\nThe chicken and waffle was yummyyy! The dish was HUGE and the chicken was juicy and tender. It was breaded and fried perfectly. The sweet potato waffle was on point and fluffy and so unique in its taste. It wasn't overpowering and had like a hint of cinnamon sweetness to it. The hash was also really good. Everyone meshed so well together and it just seems like a dish where you can't go wrong with. I felt like the avocado aioli was the key to the whole thing. I could shower in it (is that weird?). We definitely asked for more of that sauce. \\n\\nService: Even though it was already crazy so early in the morning, the service was great! A staff always came by to check on us and made sure we had enough water in our cups.

The Bianca left much to be desired; while the crust maintained its crispiness, the spinach and tomatoes were soggy from having been heavily drenched in olive oil. The Verdura was also rather unimpressive; yes, the vegetable toppings were fresh, but it was lacking in flavor. The Cherry Bomb, however, was my personal fave of the three. Not wanting a complete vegetarian meal, I requested an add-on of pepperoni, which blended quite well with the already spicy pizza. Not too greasy but tasty with a hint of spiciness, it was definitely better quality pepperoni.\\n\\nThe owner, who was sporting a pair of Bono shades when I came in, is a hoot and the rest of the staff were as friendly as could be.

You know how some French toast is a little stinky, a little too egg-y?  Not this one.  It's the right combination of bread, egg and sweet and it was so easy to clear that plate.\\n\\n*Praline bacon - holy moly, this bacon is tasty, but really bad for you.  Probably about a million calories and sweet.  Even a decadent person can only have one piece before regret starts to set in.

The kitchen is organized, operating like a machine to keep things clean. \\n\\n-Never any ordering issues! Because the kitchen has this orchestrated amazing operation; you can bank on your order being 100% correct and delicious. This coming from a vegan, who will find a micro dust of dairy if there is one. Even with all the customers, the orders come out quickly, are correct, and come with a friendly smile. They even ask if you need anything else! \\n\\n-It's authentic! The owner is from Mexico City (I'm a super fan okay?). The salsas are ridiculously beautiful. I own a salsa company so I know my stuff. I come from a small town where once they close the tortilla and you don't want to open it to look at what's inside because it's covered in cheese or a weird brown sauce and you don't really know what's going on under there. No thanks... At Tacodeli the ingredients on your plact are celebrated, boasting bright colors and flavors so that you can eat with your eyes first.

Nevertheless, the vibe was comfortable, casual, and friendly.\\n\\nBased on the recommendation of our order taker, we tried two of the \\"personal\\" pizzas. When they came out, hot and fresh, I was gobsmacked by the size. They were surprisingly large with enough leftovers for a second meal for two. We opted for the Lasagna (ricotta, meatballs, basil) and the DeSano (sausage, pepperoni) pies. While both were good, the DeSano was the winner in our book. The Lasagna seemed a bit more thrown together (newbie growing pains?) with a few leaves of basil laid atop the cooked pizza, too much ricotta on some pieces and none on others, and the sharpness of raw garlic in a few bites. We were won over by the Goldilocks of crust though - not too thin, not too thick, with a nice chewiness.\\n\\nIf you don't feel like driving all the way to Dripping Springs for Pieous and are seeking less of a hipster scene than Bufalina Due, DeSano definitely fits the bill.

First, the waiter we had both times seemed completely clueless or indifferent to customer satisfaction.  Second, this place has no air-conditioning and crappy seating....If anyone has lived a summer in Austin you for sure know that eating a hot soup in hot weather would be a terrible experience.\\n\\nTo sum this up, the ramen gets 4 stars and everything else gets 2.

We have been to Jake's several times within the past couple of years. It had always been great. This time, unfortunately, not as much.\\nWe went on a Wednesday evening, made a \\"birthday reservation\\". We were first greeted by a very professional and friendly host and hostess. From there, all down hill. Our server was condescending and uptight. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, however it was not busy at the time we arrived and the attitude continued throughout the meal. \\nI did notice how much care and attention she gave other people surrounding us. She kept making remarks such as, \\"Oh your first time here huh?\\" and \\"Oh, just appetizers?\\" She was so inattentive that when we were finished with our appetizers, I told her \\"That is good for now\\" as we wanted to converse and enjoy the bottle of wine we purchased. She immediately brought us some complimentary birthday dessert which made us feel she did not listen to what we said or dismissed us to the point of assuming that we would not purchase more or something to the like.\\nWe always indulge when we come to Jake's, several courses and a couple of bottles of wine. We spend. The service has always been great before this last time. The servers were always are attentive, informative, friendly, professional, describe the menu, wine inquiries, pour us wine when our glasses were low, ect. This server was not knowledgeable or friendly and honestly made us feel like she wasn't going to waste her time on us for reasons I'd rather not assume but had difficulty trying to not think of......  We are not perhaps the typical customer? Not white... Hate to say or assume this but most everyone at the restaurant was. We were dressed up for the occasion, presented ourselves properly, ect... I can not be certain this was in fact the issue. However the surrounding customers who stayed a much shorter time than we did were spent much more time on and were paid more attention to. \\nThe food was not as good, more salty than usual. Real bummer. We always are very pleased with every aspect of our experience usually.\\nThe meal ended with the later evening host not knowing his head from his ass. We paid for valet parking, he left the ticket on the counter after we paid, did not say anything to us, we inquired and he said he didn't validate it yet, walked off, then validated it. We looked for the valet attendant outside , no one was to be found. We walked back inside and asked what was going on, the host didn't know. We had to inquire with the head bartender, he finally gave us our keys and no one said a thing. What a crap end to the evening!\\nWe always spend a pretty penny at Jake's and expect professional service when we spend the kind of money we do. I have a background in the hospitality service in Portland and know what standards should be upheld. Jake's is going down hill it seems.

We were served with fresh bread and oil shortly after we received our drinks while we waited for our food which was exactly what we needed since we were hungry. Since we were the only patrons there, our food came out pretty quick. We ordered the Colorado Trout in a butter, garlic, capers and lemon sauce over spinach and potatoes and the Cannelloni stuffed with spinach, crab and ricotta cheese in a pancetta truffle cream sauce. They were both very flavorful and all the ingredients tasted fresh. Our food was so delicious that it was hard to stop eating when we were full! Our server, Marco,  was very friendly and attentive. He came by a few times to refill our water even though we had the bottle on our table to fill ourselves. He also asked us more than a couple times how we were doing and how our food was which we appreciated.

The dishes are definitely meant to serve 1 but if you get enough you could do a family style meal, which we usually do. The chicken tikka masala was outstanding. Honestly one of the best I have had. The dal was also very delicious. the rice was perfect and the galub jamen was very good, which my kids were excited about. The only down-spot to it was that it was a little pricey.

We ordered warm kale salad at the recommendation of the server, burrata cheese, seared tuna, fresh spaghetti, Canadian poutine, pork belly and the 48 hour slow cooked beef short rib 7 ounces. Portions were small but with all the options it worked out nicely between 4 people. The kale salad with roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts was a great interpretation of this superfood. Burrata cheese came with roasted beets, chestnut cream and pickled grapes. It could have used a few more rye crackers. Seared tuna was cooked on the outside, not much seasoning and served cold but it worked with the crunchy vegetables and sauces. All Canadian poutine was great and highlight was several large pieces of lean maple bacon on top. The beef short rib seemed a little undercooked for 48 hours, I expected a little more tenderness and fall off type meat. The pork belly seemed heavy on the fat and sauce and was helped by the pickled cabbage. For dessert we had the coconut custard blueberry ice cream and chocolate ganache with earl grey ice cream.

Upon arriving at Masa we were not greeted but just left to wander around the bar trying to find a high top, not knowing whether we were able to sit outside or not. We did find the host and he thankfully allowed us to be seated quickly outdoors; there was an extremely loud band that had just started playing and it would have been a screaming match rather than an enjoyable dinner anywhere but outside.\\n\\nOnce seated outside next to two other parties, we were greeted by two servers who told us our actual server would be out later in the night. We placed drink and tapas orders through these servers and thus began the theme of the evening: if an order wasn't forgotten it was taken to a different table. Any drinks we ordered went to the party to the far right of us, any food went to the table next to us, and the same was true for those tables. We were served two glasses of rose at one point and really honestly thought it was a \\"sorry for the terrible and slow service\\" gesture until they were whisked away and brought to the next table. We never received our tapas and by the time we saw our server again we didn't want another drink or another dish knowing that it was going to take 45 minutes to come to the table next to us.\\n\\nTo summarize, the service was clearly terrible but in regards to food, the margaritas were just okay, the mussels were dry, and the onion rings should have been better (they were, after all, named \\"Best of Boston\\")."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"As a venue, Stubb's was the largest BBQ spot I have ever been to.  Their back patio had 2 huge stages for live music.  Their \\"downstairs\\" had another stage, and dance floor for a band or dj. The place just had huge rooms with open spaces. I can't imagine how fun it would be if it was packed with people, music, and alcohol.\\n\\nUnfortunately our flight out of Austin was for 7pm, so we caught an early 5pm dinner on a Sunday.  Ironworks was closed on Sundays and Juan in a Million was closed at 3pm every day, so we picked Stubbs as a plan C.  The place had about 40% of the tables on the main floor filled.  There was no live music going on.  The  waitstaff and hostess were all tatted up, mod/emo/punk/vampire (whatever they want to call themselves nowadays) with piercings and cool dyed hair.  We requested a table in the covered patio, and was quickly shown to our table.\\n\\nHubby and I ordered the 3 meat, 2 side combo, with marble-ized brisket, pork ribs, sausage, fries, and cheesy serrano spinach.  I picked fried green tomatoes for the table to share, since I've never seen it on a  menu, and I've seen the movie.  The brisket is not as good as Rudy's.  It was cut in thicker sizes, and was a bit dry.  The pork ribs were really moist, for having a dry rub, but it was not consistent.  2 out of my sister's 4 ribs was dry.  The sausage was ok.  Nothing special for me to remember at this moment.  Fries have been consistently good in Texas, and at Stubb's, it was no different.  The fries here were skinny and long, and reminded the hubby of the Berryessa flea market fries.  (all Koreans know everything about the Berryessa flea)\\n\\nThe highlight of the meal was the cheesy serrano spinach.  It was served with a bit thicker texture than cream of spinach, more of like a mashed potato texture.  The flavors were amazing.  I asked the girl and she said they used sour cream as their cheese.  I'm going to try to make this at home! :)\\n\\nThe fried green tomatos made me a fan.   I would order this every time I saw it on the menu. \\n\\nAs a BBQ joint, I'm still not fully impressed.

They were tender, but not fall off the bone. And, they seemed to lack seasoning. Thankfully, there were several types of sauce on the table. \\n\\nSpeaking of sauce, I tried every variety, and they were all tasty. And the espresso sauce? Yum AND interesting. Can't help but wonder if the coffee roasting place next door had anything to do with that.\\n\\nMy friend had the sausage and said it was fine. I'd like to try it for myself next time. \\n\\nThe sides were pretty decent, although I don't care so much about sides. I thought the potato salad was fine, but the beans REALLY needed salt.

Ramen Tatsu-Ya seemed to have the best reviews, so after a long day of bike-riding and creek-swimming down by Barton Springs, we headed up Lamar for a nice big bowl of steaming pork broth and noodles.\\n\\nWe got there about 5:45 PM on a Wednesday, and we just beat the rush.  There were 4 or 5 people in front of us, and we ordered within 5-10 minutes. Then we scoped out the area to find seating. All the tables were full, and there was one small two-seater table cramped behind a large party, so we grabbed two stools at the bar, which I kind of prefer anyway. A high bar means my face is closer to my bowl of ramen, for neater slurping and less broth-stains on my shirt!\\n\\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu (soy sauce added) and my boyrfiend tried the plain Tonkotsu.\\n\\nPROS: \\n--They let you order kaedama -- extra noodles? Yes, please!\\n-- They offer fresh garlic cloves and a press for DIY garlic flavor! I'm a fan of any place that allows you to up the garlic ante!\\n-- If you get there early, seating is not a problem. Hours are 5-10 PM.\\n-- The menu offers lots of additions and modifications. I think I would enjoy trying the Mayu (blackened garlic oil), the tsukemen (cold noodles for dipping on the side), and the Corn on the Bomb option (buttered corn added to your ramen).\\n\\nCONS:\\n-- Seating is both limited and cramped. \\n-- Not open for lunch.\\n-- If you get there later, there will be a long line to order and to pay.\\n-- The garlic presses they provide are pretty weak; the cloves ended up only a bit mushed in the chamber and weren't pressed entirely through the sieve part.\\n-- I found the broth to not be as flavorful as what I'm used to getting in LA, but I suppose you can't have everything. \\n-- Their portions of noodles are pretty small. I'm used to paying less than a buck for kaedama in LA; here it is $2 and half the size. But perhaps shipping fresh ramen noodles to central Texas from the West Coast is costly.\\n-- Their service is a bit spotty. Both my BF and I ordered kaedama and we had to wait a long time to get ours. I had to remind them. Finally they brought him his order. I had to remind them about mine. Almost 10 minutes later, I got it.  By that time, the broth was cold and my second bowl didn't taste as good as it could have.\\n-- The noodles are a bit firmer than what I prefer.\\n\\nOverall, Ramen Tatsu-Ya falls short in many of the areas that make a good ramen house (service, garlic presses, and most of all broth richness), I'm just happy to have any ramen in Austin at all!"},{"name":"Heritage Grill","address":"447 Columbia Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"3","text":"Stopped by this afternoon on the entertainments dime.

However, the people had spoken and as we streamed into the great hall it held all which we desired. \\n\\nHoneyed biscuits playfully danced in the front, a pair of miga trays beckoned with its spicy and cheesy options. A proper cactus and tomato dish held firm around the crispy bacon and roasted potatoes. Vegetarian enchiladas deceived those before the final table. A roast brisket towered over the rest with a char from the dead of night. 13 hours of smoking labor rendered the fat into a moist, delicious glaze. The sliced sausage and chicken tempted lesser men, but there was only one true brisket in all the land - and it was delicious."},{"name":"Wrights Gourmet Sandwich Shoppe","address":"5482 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4","text":"Craving an awesome turkey sandwich that is stuffed with delicious turkey meat, sweet Granny smith apples, fresh greens and overflowing with blue cheese crumbles?

I took a bite of the pound cake slice in front of me and I was amazed at how moist it was.. and then I realized it was LEMON flavored. LOVE TIMES A BILLION. This is SO my place. I've since come to learn this is a favorite, the lemonade cake. My water waters right now thinking about it. \\n\\n\\nI've also had the Shrimp Po' Boy, which is probably my second favorite. The Cuban was just okay -- I've had better elsewhere, but it wasn't bad. \\n\\nThe tea is super sweet. There's lots of great salads and soup choices, and a whole bunch of desserts lining the counter up front. The outdoor seating is much better in my opinion.

That this place was better than China Pearl. It was what I wanted to say after trying the shumai and rice pork meatballs. I am glad I did not let myself say this until I tried all of the other dishes because it was not true. \\n\\nI have to say, the crowd/mob mentality got me thinking I was being served really excellent food. What do I mean? Since when does a large crowd mean good food? It's assumed that good food draws a lot of people and therefore the store is always crowded. Well, here is my theory. When you eat around happy and loud people, you feel like you can eat more, let loose, and even have good and loud conversations yourself without disturbing a neighboring table. No need to be shy. And somehow, you think the food is better since there is so many people squished in the room with you and they must also be enjoying their food too right? And how they manage to always find seats for you is amazing considering the long lines waiting for the seat and how packed the place is the whole time you're eating. Well, this does not necessarily mean good food. When I slowed down, after the peak of the new place, new food, and the \\"I haven't had breakfast yet!\\", I realized that not all of the food was good.\\n\\nThe shumai was definitely good. Piping hot and steamy. The rice covered pork meatball reminded me of sea urchins. Strange eh? It was my first time having this dish and it was pretty good. Very hot and juicy. The ha cao (not sure of the spelling) or the shrimp dumpling was not so good. It was juicy which was not right. Oil dripped from the dumpling when I bit into it. Then it fell apart. Uh oh. The beef tripes was ok. At first I thought it was really good but the more I eat it and try to disect the flavors, I realized that it was quite pungent. The ginger and green onion did not do it's job to mask the smell of the tripe. It could be that they did not boil the tripe long enough before steaming it. The egg rice congee was really good. It was really hot. Not spicy hot but steaming hot. It was watery compared to the slightly thicker congee I would get from other places. This is perfect for me though. We also had the chicken feets in black bean sauce. It was good. Not the best I have had but decent. The soft tofu in a sugar syrup was cold. That bothered me. I was not happy at all with this.  \\n\\nI would definitely give it to Hei La Moon for having a packed restaurant and always seeming to have seats and piping hot and steaming dishes (except the tofu dish I had) of food when the carts go around.

YES. my type of place already. \\n\\nservice started quickly. one of the first things i noticed on the menu (which, truth be told, i'd obsessed over online beforehand) was the drink list. they make every type of martini known to man. that's not what i noticed, though. i noticed the haffenreffer puzzle caps, pbr, and miller high life. YES! classy establishment selling my dorm beers of choice? bff half-heart pendant necklace time! although i chose a hefeweizen from the draught list, my heart was officially warmed.\\n\\nwe started with the artichoke dip. it's basically every delicious dairy item known to man mixed with huge chunks of artichoke, served with homemade pita chips. SO GOOD. you know how most of the time, when you order artichoke dip, you're lucky to fight over the one visible sliver of artichoke? yeah, not here, kids. every pita chip looked like it had a half cup of dip globbed onto it due to the beast pieces of artichoke. rad rad rad. because we ordered the dip, i only had two pieces (haha, ONLY two pieces!) of the bread. it's delicious and i was kind of bummed i didn't have it in me to eat more. luckily, the courses were spread out far enough that i had time to recoup, but i was never like, \\"where the eff is my food?\\"\\n\\nthe entrees. whoa baby. i got the bacon wrapped haddock (two decent-sized pieces of haddock wrapped in bacon with a black peppery corn puree and quartered, perfectly cooked red potatoes). i ended up bringing home one of the pieces of fish because i was so full from the dip, but it was so delicious. there wasn't much to it other than the fish and bacon, but there didn't need to be. the puree was a great compliment to the dish.\\n\\nmy boyfriend got the sea salt and herb half chicken. what a flavorful piece o' meat. it was perfectly moist and i'd absolutely get it myself sometime. it came with vegetables but, truth be told, i didn't pay much attention to them because i was obsessed with my own food. i did have some of his buttered peas (because we wanted to make a joke about the pea-ness. why on earth did they let us in to this nice place?). \\n\\nwe didn't get any dessert or coffee because, truth be told, i was starting to feel uncomfortable in my belly, despite the fact that we were sitting in such a cozy spot. i wanted to, though. next time?\\n\\nthe service was just fine. our server was pleasant and engaging, but believably so and not at all overbearing. he was there when he needed to be and was very sincere. i like not having to a) put on the fake niceness and b) pray that the server will leave me alone. i got to use my real niceness. yay!\\n\\ni found that the prices were extremely reasonable for the quality/quantity of the food. the two beers, an appetizer, and two entrees were $95 (including tip). this wasn't a typical night out for us in terms of price, as we are poor, but i find that the coziness, the prettiness, the deliciousness, and the courteousness (and the pea-ness?) made this experience worth every penny. i will absolutely be back.\\n\\nwild horse, you're my new food boyfriend.\\n\\np.s. if you like it here, go to the old spot in salem."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"6 hours man.

Delicious. \\n\\nI ended up ordering the Sante Fe Style Eggs Benedict and was extremely satisfied. I usually can eat a lot, but this seemingly small dish filled me up. Topped with avocado and hollandaise sauce, it had just the right amount of spice and salt. \\n\\nHowever, the omelette that my buddies got seemed a little plain, and the nut crusted Texas toast stuffed with banana is better as a breakfast dessert to be shared with several people. \\n\\nDefinitely recommend heading here though.

I got the vegatable platter with potato, broccoli and green beans, my husband the steak and potatos and my son the salmon and fries. The salmon was good but at $12.95 this was the most expensive kids meal I have ever ordered. The fries were cold, as was all of  my food, we waited for over an hour to get it but I still sent it back. It came back quickly this time and tasted fine, but fine is not what I want for this kind of money. My husbands steak did not sizzle at the table like promised, he liked it but saldy we were just not blown away. For dessert he got the chocolate cake with berries which was also not special.

But add to the fact that our waitress took on an average of 20 minutes to return to the table between each unsuccessful order and you've got some upset patrons. Finally I decided to just call it quits but then my waitress brings me the beer I ordered first but in a can. I thought things were starting to look up but the beer had a stamped expiration date on the bottom from six months prior.  It seemed to take nearly that long to get the check and leave.

Our waiter asked us if we wanted wine, but we deferred to water for the evening. Our waiter brought us a basket of 2 biscuits and 2 cornbread muffins.

In fact, he didn't really seem to care.  \\n\\nIt took ANOTHER 20 minutes to get our food, a burger and pierogies, items which they continued to shuttle constantly to other tables while we waited and watched.  \\n\\nThis means it took about 50 minutes to get a burger and pierogies, their most frequently ordered items.  All told, with the wait to order and the one \\"small plate\\", it took us 2 hours to eat.  We were *not* trying to spend our entire evening there.\\n\\nWhat made it worse was that there was a table that was being really disruptive, loud, and swearing, and no one, even the two owners who were there, seemed to notice or care.  The booth behind us who had small children finally had to complain. \\n\\nIt really is too bad because the food is good, however the portions are small and expensive.  I really wanted to like them, but it is hard to when they really don't seem to care about the customer experience, and clearly haven't learned the hard lessons of losing a contest on TV that identified the service and timing issues."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We went here for my birthday before going to the spa across the street.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The Fox brothers brought Texas style BBQ to Atlanta back in 2007 and have been getting a lot of national and local press ever since.   This is some of the best BBQ I have found and it has a huge following in Atlanta.  When folks come into town to visit, this is one of the places we usually end up.  It seems those who aren't even BBQ fans can come in and find something off of their menu and come out a fan.  Many of my friends request to go back on their return visits, its that good.\\n\\nI've had several things not the menu.  One of the best things to get on your first visit the Everything Plate - you can sample it all of their specialties.   I think one of the things they do best is their Beef Brisket which you can get chopped or sliced.  It's always tender with a rich smoke flavor and their BBQ sauce has the right of amount of spice, it's perfect.  \\n\\nI always judge a BBQ joint on their pulled pork and they do this well.  When i stop in for lunch I get the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Cole Slaw.  The pork is always tender with a rich smokey flavor, and it is a generous portion.  If you are adventurous, try the Fox Brothers Burger - it is chopped brisket, bacon, and melted pimento cheese.  It's cardiac arrest heaven between a bun.\\n\\nFox brothers has some of he best side portions I've ever had.  When okra is in season, try the fried okra, it's fresh and not frozen.   It isn't the cut up okra we are accustomed to, its an entire okra breaded and fried.  All the sides are made fresh everyday and they don't taste like they came off of a Sysco truck.  \\n\\nThe bar is small, but they have great beer selection.  You can't Texas BBQ without a good Texas beer, yes, they have Shiner Bock.  When the weather is nice, they have additional seating outside.  Parking can be challenging in their small lot, but you can usually find street parking on the adjacent Elmira Place.  Every visit I always come away happy - great service, and consistent mouth watering BBQ and sides.  We are lucky to have Fox Brothers in town."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"1st time for me and my hubby and I had the shrimp and grits and it was amazing!

We were trying it as an alternative to Texas De Brazil.  I have to say that we were totally wrong, Black Fire does not compare favorably in anyway to Texas De Brazil.  The meats, when they finally show up at your table, are bland and generally overcooked.  The slices are small and quickly removed before you can ask for more and the return of meat to your table is annoyingly infrequent.  We asked almost immediately for the filet with no bacon, and were told multiple times that they were making it; we never saw it at our table.  None of the cuts of meat were memorable for good reasons, we just kept finding out what meats we didn't want again.  The top sirloin was the only average meat, all others were far below average.  The buffet was lack-luster and the hot food was slightly above warm, but definitely not hot.  The sushi was the only food that was ok, very average and basic, annoyingly the soy sauce is in little tear packets, which made no sense.  Water cup stayed empty for long periods of time.

We both ordered off of of the specials list. My husband had pan fried sturgeon with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies that was cooked to perfection. I had red snapper with balsamic vinegar reduction served along side vegetable risotto. Our appetizer was crab won-tons, similar to crab ran-goon that had a delightful sweet and sour salsa served for dipping sauce. After a nice bottle of wine and a great meal, we had to take one of their delectable deserts to go. Later on that evening, we dove into our chocolate banana cream pie, that was not like any typical banana pie I have had and was pretty close to amazing. \\n\\nThe price point, was higher than I wanted to spend, but looking at their cheap eats option, would offer us a good reason to go back more frequently. Bottom line, this is a place I would put to the top of my list for places I would frequent often. The menu is large and they have a nice seasonal menu with great specials.

I was helped by Molly (about 5'5\\"ish, brown curly hair) and it was just very bleh all the way around. She was clearly busy, rushing around to different tables and when a server is that busy I always try to give them the benefit of the doubt but she just clearly was not happy and didn't want to be there and didn't mind making her customers feel her pain.\\n\\nFirst, my white wine came to the table at room temp so I asked for a glass of ice so I could at least cool the little carafe that held the rest of my wine. From her body language she conveyed the message that this was a huge inconvenience, you would have thought I asked for her first born they way she sighed and acted. \\n\\nThen, we asked for our appetizer and entree to be served together. Apparently that meant we wanted the calamri app to be made and then sit there waiting for our entree to be made because it came out at room temp too, with one of the sauces congealed over on top because it sat out too long. \\n\\nWhen we got our food we still hadn't gotten any silverware. She said she would bring it right to us but instead she did a couple of things first and then brought us our silverware so we were sitting there with our food in front of us and no way to eat it for almost a minute. \\n\\nAll of this wouldn't even be so bad if it hadn't been for a couple of things. 1) I heard another server offer to help with her tables and she said \\"no, I got it\\", when she clearly didn't. (this was when we still were waiting for our silverware) and 2) even though she was too busy to be friendly or efficient she still had time to stop and chit chat with the other servers which I saw her doing multiple times. \\n\\nI love Jakes, it is a great Portland restaurant but servers like this either need to be retrained on how to serve in a high end restaurant or they shouldn't work there.

I was not led astray, nor disappointed.  I returned to the popular and reveled in the heavenly Closed on Sunday chicken sandwiches.  Adding my two favorite sides collard greens and famed Mac and cheese. The sandwiches were perfect reminiscent of something between a chicken mini and chicken sandwich but so delicious. Fried but the taste was not heavy or oil laden. Topped with dill pickle and a spicy but not overwhelming sauce and balanced on toasted king hawaiian rolls. It wowed me and reminded me of the famous fried chicken I had at Revival previously but yet was uniquely different. I found myself later wishing I could sample another.    My fellow diners had the Springer roasted Chicken and the other the meatloaf.  Both were perfect blue plate specials.  They both had carrots and cabbage. Each was amazing and good- I will warn that in the cabbage beware of ham bone fragments. It doesn't affect taste - just brings in exquisite taste. \\n\\nWe topped our meal and split the Lemon icebox pie. Delicious crumbly crust - graham brown sugar base with a tart but sweet lemon filling and whipped cream with candied rind. Don't remember much except we were scraping our plates. Don't wait- take the friends, the date, or the family.  Can't wait to go back for Tea Time. \\n\\nI will admit service at the bar was received better by me.

Brunch was a big deal for us while in graduate school there and we frequented one of the best pancake houses I've ever been to, Walker Brothers. As a vegetarian, I am always looking for places that are both creative and plentiful with their vegetarian options.\\n\\nMasa has a completely different style from Walker Brothers as the latter is more focused on the traditional comfort breakfast foods, with variations that don't stray to far from the norm. Masa's brunch lives more south of the border and classes things up with signature breakfast cocktails that don't fail to please. This was my third visit to  Masa and I've had a cocktail each time. Always light and refreshing, never heavy on the booze. Cornbread replaces the traditional rolls of other restaurants and it is served with three spreads including a mango butter and a cranberry jam. This time, the cornbread was a little on the cooler side, but still enjoyable.\\n\\nMasa has a weekend 2-course brunch special for $8 that includes a starter and a main course, plus bottomless coffee. My friend opted for this and all started with the delectable caramelized plantain empanada. Crisp and flaky shell surrounding tender, perfectly-cooked and sweetened, not-mushy plantains on the inside. Magic, and probably the best part of the meal. I, as the vegetarian, opted for the Stuffed Mexican omelet with chili roasted vegetables for my main and he tackled the creamy chorizo scrambled eggs. The omelet was cooked well, but I felt was a somewhat uninspiring, standard, fold-over omelet with roasted vegetables. I would have liked some more \\"chili\\" as suggested by the name, as well as some more flavor. Chipotle or mole flavors would have worked well with this omelet. My friend enjoyed his chorizo eggs thoroughly.\\n\\nService was good and attentive, no complaints here.

The mac & cheese was good; I'm not a mac & cheese connoisseur, but it seemed light to me, no heavy cream sauce. The prawn taco had a good taste, but the prawns were overcooked (very tough), and the whole thing got soggy and fell apart-had to eat it with a fork. The fried cod sliders were good, but I would've liked some seasoning on the fish. The South African beef jerky was good-I liked the texture and the spice on it.

It was such a tender moment, I think I cried a little.  I order my meats, brisket, pulled pork, potato salad, and beans.  we get our plates and we sit on the benches provided.  \\n\\nFirst let me preface this next paragraph by saying that I love my bbq sauce, but there are some bbq purists out there that say that *good* bbq should not need sauce.  So whenever I get my bbq I always give it my personal \\"purity test\\".  I have it first without any sauce.  The brisket passes with flying colors.  The pulled pork passes as well, but I perfer it with either the pork/hot/or espresso sauce.

Thinking about making the trip? Check out the details below. \\n\\nI was so incredibly excited about this Gospel Brunch. I made reservations with a few friends weeks in advance, worried that the crowd would be huge. There are two different pricing options - one is $22.95 with no view of the band and the other has a view of the band for $28.95. We went with the no-band view, wanting to save a few bucks. This was definitely the wrong choice - the band (located in the Stubb's downstairs dining area) was absolutely fantastic. Bells of Joy was playing and they were phenomenal - the singing was perfection, the song choice sublime, and the music was echoing around the restaurant. I definitely think the experience would have been better if we had a band view - otherwise, it seems like you're just paying for a recording of the band played over a loud speaker. The real magic was going down to the basement to watch - if I come back, I'll definitely spring for the band view option. \\n\\nNow, onto the food. The line for the brunch food was short when I arrived, which was fantastic. However, the food was underwhelming: most of it cold, some options mentioned online completely unavailable, and served on cardboard plates. I got a little bit of everything. My review of pretty much every item available: the flavor was simply not there. I was so excited to try so many different things, and none of them had the kick I was looking for. A very flavorless brunch. \\n\\nNext stop: the drinks. Going into the brunch, I did think drinks were included, as they do say that patrons will be able to enjoy their \\"World Famous Bloody Mary Bar.\\" However, this is not the case - drinks are not included in the price. My misunderstanding definitely put a sour taste in my mouth, but maybe I should have expected this - I did feel, for the price, that the bar should have been included, but I could just be asking for too much. I asked the bartender about getting a 'make your own' Bloody Mary, but I was told that the only option I had was for the bartender to make me one, so I went with a mimosa instead. Very heavy on the champagne, very light on the orange juice. Not necessarily a bad thing, just not what I expected. \\n\\nAll in all, this isn't a brunch I'll be going back to. For the price, my experience was underwhelming at best. The music was amazing, but I should definitely have gotten the band view to get the full effect. The food was mediocre, and the drinks not included, and not \\"make your own.\\" If you're looking for a solid brunch excursion, I would look elsewhere."},{"name":"Ward 8","address":"90 N Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I came on a Tuesday evening, made a reservation with a party of 6, and everything was great.

I had no idea about this place(except for their first appearance on BA) and its popularity. We were roughly 20 people from the front, talking to some cool Austinites while trying to drown out others(hipsters). The guys were real cool, bringing out water and cups to help us with this Texas heat. The doors finally open and in we are, the interior reminds me of 70's bbq joints that never updated with the exception that everything looks new.

Is the BBQ really that good? Read on about what this legendary BBQ is like and how you can bypass the famous wait time with pre-ordering!\\n\\nAside from the amazingly long line outside the restaurant, my first impression of Franklin BBQ is the alluring strong smokey aroma that emanated from the packed meat and made the meat even more irresistible. The famous brisket tasted as delicious as its smokey scent, yet despite it being so well-smoked, the brisket was still surprisingly moist, making it great to be enjoyed on its own or as a sandwich. The spotlight should also be on the pulled pork, which is a fatty guilty pleasure that makes a perfect sandwich with the complimentary house BBQ sauce that adds a sweet tangy taste.\\n\\nHowever, my favorite has to be the juicy and tender ribs that was simply phenomenal! Even though the brisket and the pulled pork were delicious, the ribs definitely topped as the best among the three by far. If I were to return again, I would get more ribs over anything else!\\n\\nIf Franklin BBQ was this good, did I think it was worth the wait? \\n\\nUnfortunately, no. \\n\\nFranklin BBQ is certainly the best BBQ I had, but I didn't find the difference between Franklin and other good places to be significant enough to warrant the long wait. I had Franklin BBQ from pre-order and although I was happy to try such delicious meat, I was glad I didn't make the commitment to wait.\\n\\nHence, if you want to wait solely to eat, you will be disappointed. There is no reason not to  pre-order and wait for a month instead of spending virtually a whole day waiting outside unless you cannot take advantage of the pre-order system. If you do intend to wait, find a group of friends to spend the day, bring chairs and drinks, and have the mentality that the journey matters more than the destination.\\n\\nWhile I do not recommend the wait, I do recommend trying Franklin BBQ at least once in your lifetime no matter where you live. The hype is real and that's why the demands for this legendary BBQ continues to be its own legend.\\n\\n---\\nTIPS ON SUCCESSFUL PRE-ORDER\\n\\n1) All pre-orders must be sent to the email on the website precisely on 9:00 AM of the first Monday the month before your intended pick-up date (i.e. November 2nd if you want to pick-up on any day in December). You will have no chance of success even if you were a minute late so be sure to synchronize your clock.\\n\\n2) All 9:00 AM emails are entered in a lottery. While you can choose the day of pick-up, you may be asked to switch to a weekday if you request a weekend after winning the lottery.\\n\\n3) Orders must be picked up between 10-10:30 AM on the agreed day - Be sure to have a local proxy if you are not a local and had to pick up on a weekday.\\n\\n4) Get a group to pool in orders as a single pre-order, because each pre-order has be at least 5 lb of meat - as a reference, the restaurant suggests 1/2 lb as an adult serving size. More people = more entries in lottery anyway!\\n\\n---\\ntl;dr version:\\n1) Definitely the best BBQ!\\n2) Brisket and pulled pork are delicious, but rib is the best\\n3) Not worth the wait, go for the pre-order"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Super crowded, extremely nice staff, one of Portland's \\"coolest\\" breakfast brunch spots.

It was my first experience having tacos that weren't Tex Mex or border style (I'll let others quibble over the exact terminology). There are no refried beans, soy/beef mixes, or orange \\"cheese products,\\" and there are no foil-wrapped burritos the size of your arm. This place isn't anything like what most people think of when they think Mexican. At the same time, this isn't a \\"fusion\\" place with daikon and \\"encrusted\\" whatever or clever combinations of Asian and South American cuisine.\\n\\nWhile they probably don't meet a purist's defintion of Mexican, they are definitely using slight variations on traditional interior Mexican cuisine. \\n\\nMole (pronounced moh-lay) tacos were what hooked me at first. Mole is a dark, brown chili based sauce (some versions contain chocolate, I'm not sure if theirs does). I don't think I've seen a mole taco anywhere else in Austin. Moles are very complex sauces and you'll be well rewarded if you spend a little time savoring each bite to pick out all of the spices. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(sauce)\\n\\nThe ceviche is a Mexican classic, and Taco Deli's is very, very tasty--lime juice and fresh fish with a spicy finish that sneaks up on you. I often save it as my last taco as a cleanse your palette sort of thing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceviche#Central_America_and_The_Caribbean\\n\\nPicadillo is a ground beef with tomato sauce. It is similar in appearance to sloppy joes, but tastes oh-so-much better. Slightly sweet with just a few pieces of fresh tomato and romain lettuce for crunch. It's probably a good starter for picky kids or the hot/spicy averse. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picadillo\\n\\nCochinita pibil is a pork taco with a taste that was a little unexpected the first time I had one. It includes pickled purple onions that are crunchy, vinegar-y and delightful with the juicy shredded pork. Low on the spicy heat side, very filling, but a little messy (lean well forward; take off watches!). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochinita_pibil\\n\\nAnother personal favorite is the Cowboy. Spicy rub sirloin with a smokey, grilled thing going on. The guacamole is a citrusy version, more of a sauce than the dip/puree version you usually get. Spicy (meaning lots of spices) but not hot. \\n\\nMy current new favorite though is the Deli Belly (served only on Wednesday and Saturday). It is unfortunately named (google it), and they should consider renaming it. It's got pork belly in it and a sauce I'm not familiar with. Its difficult to describe. Its got some sweet, some low heat and... I don't know. I just know that when I'm eating one my eyes are closed and I'm happy. Its right up there as one of my all time favorite tacos.\\n\\nI could go on and on. I've had most of the menu at one time or another. There are lots of other good things. Many of their items include chunks of grilled chicken or beef and can be kind of dry or uninteresting for some folks (Mexico City, Fundido, etc). They're definitely tasty, but light on sauces or other ingredients. However, they make excellent platforms for trying out Taco Deli's hot sauces. They're not the chunky tomato salsas or taco bell \\"hot sauces.\\" They're tasty and spicy and work well with the underlying flavors in the tacos; no salt for salt's sake or vinegar-y cayenne. The Dona is their signature one. Its not as hot as I first thought (though they have a habanero sauce for the suicidal among you), and the heat dissipates unexpectedly fast. I once took a few too many cups for a to go order and ended up trying the Dona with a ribeye. It makes a damn fine steak sauce, especially if you're a fan of horseradish and au jus.\\n\\nI should take a moment to mention the breakfast tacos. They're aren't as exciting as the rest of the items here. It's pretty much what most places offer: bacon, sausage, chorizo, eggs, beans, cheese (queso fresco), and such. The one thing different is their Pappas (Mexican mashed potatoes). I don't know how Mexican they are but they're damn tasty. They are a creamy, garlic-y (or maybe just sour cream based) mashed potates. Thinner than most mashed potates. I like them better than the hashed or cubed variety you find in most breakfast tacos. Those tend to be slightly dry, starchy, sticky pockets of potato that suck up the juices of the eggs and make for a dry taco experience. Some people like that, but I'm not one of them."},{"name":"Flat Patties","address":"33 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Best burger joint in the area as far as I'm concerned.

One big plus about this location is that they have a very affordable brunch menu selection that includes  two courses for a fixed price of $9.95 (Sat 10am - 3pm, Sunday 10am - 11am). \\n\\nI was completely ready to order the Huevos Rancheros because it comes ontop of a fried whole tortilla. I thought this concept was pretty interesting and definitely worth trying until I caught a glimpse of the Santa Fe Style Eggs Benedict from the corner of my eye. The smeared avocado cream definitely swayed my vote!\\n\\nMeanwhile, I decided to try the Latin Bellini that came with Champagne, a mango puree, and a guava puree. Unfortunately, I cannot rave about the drink because it tasted just like any ordinary Bellini you would have anywhere else. I'd say it was good but not amazing or life changing in any way. However, the corn bread and accompanied jams were actually really well executed. \\n\\nAs the server brought the plates over I could't get over the presentation on the Santa Fe Style Eggs Benedict. For such a simple breakfast, it was done really well. The Southwestern biscuit was nice and fluffy with a fair amount of avocado cream just under the beautifully cooked egg. The salsa on the side paired well atop the entire Eggs Benedict for the perfect bite. Normally, I would opt for no potatoes, but the potatoes were also well cooked and perfectly seasoned. I was happy with the choice I made for breakfast.\\n\\nI have to say that this location is the perfect location for a brunch out with a group of friends or even a significant other.

My Yelp review backlog is astronomical at this point and I have given up on ever trying to catch up. When I get into my writing groove, I sometimes think I can clear it up but the desire evaporates within hours... Such is life, especially for those who have one outside of writing Yelp reviews.\\n\\nAnyway, I came here last year with one of my best childhood friends with whom I shared many of my best years growing up in CT. He moved to Germany many years ago and was visiting the States properly for the first time since that international shifting of residence. I had read many things about South City Kitchen but I am quite averse to spending a lot of money at restaurants, especially when they make me dress out. I seriously abhor dress codes and one of the reasons that I just recently made a job change is for that (in addition to more important reasons though, so don't go thinking I'm just a petty antagonist). I wanted to have him eat a proper Southern meal and decided that I'd try out this place that I had on my bookmarks list with him. The special occasion made me feel more at ease with plopping down a little more and plus we went for lunch, which is a steal when considering how good the food turned out to be.\\n\\nThe space is pretty and the basket of biscuits and cornbread that we were brought to start off our meal was excellent. We also got the fried green tomatoes, which were fantastic and perfectly crispy. If there is one thing I love about the South, it is the freakin' fried green tomatoes and I was ecstatic that South City Kitchen did not let down. Ed ordered the pimento cheeseburger and loved the bread, the patty, and the pimento cheese. I had to go for the buttermilk fried chicken with potatoes and collard greens. Talk about something that is so good you want to smack your mother... My mom wouldn't permit that in a million years but this dish would make me slightly daring.\\n\\nGreat service with a comfy atmosphere right in Midtown.

Yes. I have never really liked brisket - I generally prefer pulled pork and pork ribs - until I had a bite of Franklin brisket. Now I get it! I tried brisket at three other locations, and this was clearly better than any other (MIckelthwait was close; the others aren't even in the same ballpark). Flavors are subtle, not in-your-face bold and spicy; unlike any BBQ I've ever had (in a delicious, wonderful way). I definitely prefer the fatty brisket - the fat has incredible flavor and melts away (it's not a solid lump of lard); you probably won't be doing this again soon, so just suck it up and enjoy the fat to maximize your pleasure! ... I also tried the sausage (very good), pulled pork (outstanding), and pork ribs (also outstanding). None of these needed sauce - the dry rub and smoked flavors were saturated, and subtle - but the sauces were very good in their own right. I got some slaw - it was fine. Also tried a banana cream pie (not made in-house, but from a nearby bakery) which was very good.\\n \\nWhat about the wait? Yes. It was definitely worth doing once; but I probably won't do this again unless I come with a friend.\\n \\nNote: the staff are really helpful. This was my first visit, but they deal with the lines every day and have a system, and it works. I got there at 9:10 on a Saturday in November. Based on my location in line, they predicted I'd get food at about 1:00-1:30, and I actually got my food at 1:20 (i.e., very accurate). At 10:00 they came thru the line and asked exactly what I planned to order; they use this to estimate when they'll run out so they can let people in line know what to plan for. They told me up front that there would be no turkey for me; and they told people a few spots after me that they could not guarantee any brisket or beef rib. At about 11:00 they came through with free pulled beef sandwiches."},{"name":"Stefano's Grill","address":"7512 Dr Philips Blvd, Ste 80","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I was in Orlando on business and found this place on Yelp and decided to try it based on the positive reviews.

I searched Yelp for \\"Fried Chicken\\" and Screen Door came in at Number 1 in the results.\\n\\nWe arrived at 6:00PM on a Tuesday night and and the place was buzzing. After a couple of minutes, we could feel Screen Door's air conditioning unit struggling to keep up. Thankfully, the first round of diners finished around 6:15, and we were promptly seated by Christopher, the host. Christopher may come of as snobby, but he runs a tight ship. Understandably, he would have to with the hungry diners flowing in and the line growing exponentially out the door. Our server helped us pick out the Corn Griddle Cakes and was friendly and swift, not frantic. Together with her cohorts, they made the place run like a smooth machine. After we received our healthy unhealthy portion of Fried Chicken, we realized that we regretted not ordering Macaroni and Cheese. We were having neighboring plate envy. I am not the only one. I know you get that feeling. The server said it would not take long and soon enough, a bowl of our own arrived to the table. \\n\\nOur nearly complete Southern dinner, minus dessert, consisted of Fried Green Tomatoes, Corn Griddle Cakes, Fried Chicken, Pulled Pork Sandwich and Macaroni and Cheese. Screen Door has the best Fried Green Tomatoes I've had in my life! The order came with four slices of very crispy, Fried Green Tomatoes topped with a shrimp remoulade. The recommended Corn Griddle Cakes were sweet, fluffy and dotted with fresh corn kernels. The infamous Fried Chicken arrived as pieces of boneless chicken breast and thigh, both juicy and flavorful. The chicken was encased in a thick, crispy and peppery breading. The two pieces rested against a smooth pile of mashed potatoes and were accompanied by ham gravy and collard greens. The Fried Chicken was kept dry and crispy throughout the meal. I like Country Cat's Fried Chicken, but Country Cat's gradually lost it's crunch and became soggy from sitting on top of the collard greens. I appreciate how Screen Door placed their collard greens in a bowl, separate from the chicken. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was piled high with coleslaw and tangy pork bits and sided with well seasoned french fries. We're glad we added the Macaroni and Cheese to our table. The al dente noodles were enveloped by creamy, savory cheese sauce. It was really, really good.\\n\\nAs each dish arrived, the room felt like it was getting warmer and warmer.

I also really don't understand a restaurant that doesn't do wait times. Especially for families with kids--there's a big difference between a ten minute wait and a 45 minute wait when you're standing with toddlers in that tiny place.

(but that could say more about the inept cab driver than anything else) The Squealing Pig could have been that type of restaurant, but it's not, the service is poor and the burgers are so ordinary it's not even funny. This is a hospitality business, yes? I think someone forgot to tell our waitress, who might have been having a bad day for all I know, but she was full of attitude. It almost felt like we were intruding or something, never feeling welcome and mostly being ignored the entire meal. The Pig Burger, topped with bacon, Gorgonzola, and chipotle onions is served on an Iggy's bun that is once again too large for any burger. The bacon is not crispy, and flavor is missing all over the place. There isn't an ounce of seasoning anywhere, from the bland, yet still crispy fries, to the beef, which is medium juicy, but still a bit overcooked in spots. I actually like the addition of Gorgonzola, it's a good foundation of flavor to build on, but the onions are way too spicy and really overtake the burger. There just isn't a lot to say, there's no passion here, nobody seems like they want to be here, and neither do I. Flavor and good tasting burgers make me want to come back to any restaurant, but bland food and bitter servers make The Squealing Pig a complete afterthought in more ways than one."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I had only had ramen from Whole Foods one time before coming here for the first time about 2 weeks ago.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"EASILY the best barbeque I've had in town - and I really like trying barbeque places.  If I want bbq, this is where I go.  For the longest time, I would drive past this place and virtually no one was there (perhaps they weren't open yet/remodeling?) so I assumed it was a front for drug runners or money launderers.   How wrong I was (well, they may do that as well, but they also serve great bbq!).  \\n\\nI understand why some people may not like the barbeque here - it is not sweet, wet rub-style barbeque that typifies the Southern bbq people probably grew up eating.  It's more of a Texas-style - they use a very nice, spicy dry rub on their meats and then heavily smoke them.  Thus, you get bbq that has a really great smoky taste with a good kick to it.  I think it may be too smoky and spicy for some but I love it.  They have a nice sauce as well that is also a bit spicy and not too sweet.  \\n\\nI've had pretty much everything on the menu aside from some of their appetizers.  The smoked wings are probably the best wings I've ever had.  The chicken is good, though I don't usually order chicken when I'm out.  The pulled pork and brisket are both very good and have a nice smoke ring and bark.  The pulled pork sandwich is served on a good buttery roll and is definitely the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had.  I love how the pork is actually just pulled into big chunks rather than minced down into mush like so many bbq places do.  The brisket seems to vary in quality some though - sometimes it's fantastic, other times it's very dry.  I love the ribs - they are not fall off the bone, which a lot of people don't seem to like.  I like them like they are - spicy, smoky and with some bite to them.  I know this may seem a little over the top, but these are the best ribs I've had anywhere.  It's true!  People seem to be fans of the ribs at Daddy D'z and Fat Matt's but those places just don't do it for me - those guys have big spare ribs (I prefer the baby backs) that tend to be fatty and are slathered in sweet sauce that isn't that great.  \\n\\nThe one criticism I have of Fox Bros. is that their meats, while exceptionally smoked, they can occasionally be on the dry side.  Like they just cooked a little too long.  This can be partially remedied with some sauce, but it is something I think they should be very careful about.     \\n\\nThey have a nice variety of sides that are pretty good as well (unlike some places *ahem*).  The baked beans are great (sweet with a kick), the mac & cheese is good (though they need to tone down the pepper), good collards (and I don't like collards usually), very good onion rings, ordinary bag fries & tots.  I've also had the banana pudding which was ok (too many vanilla wafers though).  \\n\\nAside from the food, the staff is good people.  A lot of pretty girls work here!  Service has been great for dine-in and take-away.  I think the patio and the interior of the restaurant are both very nice for a bbq place.  It's also much bigger and easier to eat at than Fatt Matt's (terrible set-up) or Daddy D'z (slow service when I've eaten there), for example.  \\n\\nI'm not sure if it's a fantastic or terrible thing that Fox Brothers is so close to me!\\n\\n5"},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Came in on \\"Arnold Sunday,\\" so the obvious choice was the special of the day, the \\"Double Dare Doginator\\"...

One would have to frequent this Buckhead hot spot to appreciate the change. \\n \\nNot only has the interior changed but so has the menu. Most restaurants add a cute little wreath on the front door or even a mini Christmas tree on the porch. Yebo Ski Haus wants people to talk and they have certainly established that. I love this place for the casual ambiance, friendly staff and the sensational food. The cocktails are simply the best. They even have some themed for the season.\\n \\nAsh Said It was among the cream of the crop industry leaders invited to an exclusive media dinner hosted by Yebo Ski Haus. We had the pleasure of being seated with the True Story Brands founder & CEO Justin Anthony and his beautiful wife Kelly. Mrs. Anthony is quite the trailblazer herself. Her design company Wolf Design Group is one of the most sought after brands in Atlanta. \\n \\nThese business moguls were a delight to spend the evening with. Many of us in the dining area were virtual strangers. By the end of the evening, everyone was like extended family. That is what this place is all about.\\n \\nThe menu was the most extensive I've ever seen for a press event. The food was served in such a fashion that brought people together. Everything was in shareable portions. First course included fondue, arugula salad and brussel sprouts. Main course were scallops, bolognese, curry pot pie and steak frites. Dessert was incredible. We had amarula cheesecake, amores creme br√ªl√©e and snowman gelato. The night was not complete without the famed 'shot skis'.\\n \\nThis was an incredible night and another reason to visit Buckhead more often. This place never missed the mark. Ever.

The place is dark, lush and comfortable. They accommodate large parties very well and the staff was very friendly. \\n\\nThe food was solid. This place has six kinds of nachos and we went for the most \\"alternative\\": Yuppie Nachos with melted cheddar, jack and goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and guacamole. The chips were thin and pack a nice crunch. Ingredients were not evenly distributed which created that whole  \\"who gets the chip with everything on it\\" situation. In this case, there was one chip just drenched in goat cheese, so I passed on it. I don't remember any particular ingredient being stellar, but I remember enjoying the nachos overall.\\n\\nMy boyfriend tried the drink special, The Molasses Cookie. I didn't recognize any of the ingredients (woo hoo! I'm not a total alcholic), but I did recognize the comforting taste of a molasses cookie (and booze). After a while, the whole table ordered one. Their special holiday beer, Seriously Bad Elf, was also popular. I'm thinking it's popularity was due to its high alcohol content (11.2%) and not good cheer.\\n\\nFor some reason, I was craving Chicken Picatta all day and I was thrilled they had it on the menu. Christopher's uses lime instead of the traditional lemon, so it didn't have that sour ping I was really looking for. The chicken was very moist and tender and the breading was tasty. So I'm not complaining at all. The green beans were buttery and well cooked. And the house potatoes is actually like a pancake of mashed potatoes that are a little seared on the outside: quite delicious.\\n\\nEveryone else ordered one of the many burgers they offer and each person devoured the whole burger, so I'm guessing they were good. And if you don't have a personal goal of not putting on weight this season (cuz you know you're too lazy to want to go through the effort to lose it again) consider the weekly burger special. The trend seems to be cheese and various other heart clogging ingredients stuffed into a hamburger patty with more artery hardening ingredients on top.

I've long been a partisan of the City Market in Luling as the best BBQ in the state, and given Franklin's rep, I was worried I might have to cede dominance.\\n\\nSo...is Franklin's really better?  Yes and no.  \\n\\nFirst things first:  Franklin's brisket is absolutely sick.  Even the lean cut absolutely melts in your mouth; the fatty cut is so tender you can cut it with a tiny plastic fork that couldn't puncture wet paper.  It's just out of this world.  I didn't think anything could ever rival City Market's brisket, but damned if Franklin's doesn't pull it off.  It's just perfectly cooked meat with no flourishes needed.\\n\\nSecond, if you're a fan of menu options, Franklin's gives you a bit more; you can order by the pound, in sandwich form, or on a platter, and there's different sides (including a solid potato salad) and pies as well as a variety of drinks.  If you're completely meat-focused, you won't want the diversity, but those looking for a change of pace will find it.\\n\\nHowever, it's not without its flaws.  The wait is pretty ridiculous, and is likely to get worse.  If the construction across the street turns out to be condos, the parking will disappear and the wait time will double.  City Market's food is just as good and you never wait more than a few minutes (of course, being located in Luling instead of downtown Austin helps).  Franklin's offers three kinds of sauce (not that they really need any), but only the vinegar-pepper is really good, and it can't compete with City Market's mysterious yaller concoction.  And if you're a fan of sausage, Franklin's stumbles here -- City Market's is far superior, and Franklin's is a bit thick and fatty with too much gristle, or at least it was on my visit.\\n\\n(One big caveat:  I wasn't in my usual fat-pig-at-the-trough mode when I visited, so I didn't try the ribs and so I can't compare them to the heavenly ones at City Market.)\\n\\nAll that taken into account just means that Franklin's is the second or third best barbecue in the state, not that it's not good.  It's still worth repeat visits, and the brisket is a got-damb religious experience."},{"name":"Ward 8","address":"90 N Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Nice work, Ward 8!

It is the artichoke one with a fried slice of lemon.  Very tasty although the artichoke looks and tastes a little like the artichoke soaked in oil and vinegar we get from costco.  Do not eat the fried lemon!  My wife thought it was a bell pepper and while her expressions were funny, it was not a pleasant experience for her.  \\n\\nI really liked the baguette though!  Very tasty and the pesto butter was sublime.  Almost filled ourselves up before the appetizer arrived.  \\n\\nThe chicken had some parts where it was very salty.  Felt like the sprinkling of salt was not applied evenly.  The risotto also was salty.  So much so I could not finish it.  Really had good potential as the chicken was cooked to a pretty perfect temperature and consistency.  \\n\\nThe rabbit was a nice texture (little tough and how I like it) but also on the salty side.  The kale was a little too fibrous.  \\n\\n\\nThe dessert was decent, with the sundae (3 choices of ice cream) and the petit fours.  The home-made ice cream wasn't bad but wasn't special.  The cherry flavor for example had the cocktail cherry bits rather than fresh cherry bits.  It felt like some corners were cut.  The petit fours was delicately done, perfect for two, but didn't wow.  I think they were very good though.  \\n\\nThe decor is great and the service friendly (although a little on the slow side but understandable for French cuisine).  Great that it takes open table reservations.  Again really wanted to love the place but fell short in a couple of things.  I'm definitely going back to give them a second chance though!

Decided to go with a group of 8 for dinner.  Made reservations and requested as quiet a spot as possible as we would have a couple of 80 year olds with us.  Showed up 5 minutes early and were seated immediately.  Even in a quiet spot, you're not going to get away from the noise but it really wasn't too bad.  Ordered several apps.  Veggie spring rolls were excellent.  I liked the Rumaki best - cooked perfectly with nice crisp bacon wrap.  The warm assorted olives were a hit - served with a delicious bean puree that you soak up with grilled flat bread.  Also had a \\"special\\" wild mushroom risotto which was also great.  Everyone at the table had a different favorite. \\nEntrees were all excellent.  2 had the Mee Krob and thoroughly enjoyed it.  2 had the salmon and were all but licking their plates at the end (yes, you do eat the flowers).  3 had the halibut with the scallops.  Tasted my wife's - I thought just a bit over cooked but she likes it medium to my rare so it was perfect for her.  I had the Bronzino which was perfectly cooked - nice crisp skin and incredibly flavorful.  I loved the ricotta spinach and the polenta just soaked up all the flavors.  Even though we were full, couldn't help but order the bread pudding which really is to die for.\\nOverall, we all thought it a great dinner.  We did have to wait a bit for some items - I'm sure it was because they were very busy with a lot of large groups and the marathon the next day - nothing a glass of wine wasn't able to take care of.  Service was excellent - our server was always there when needed and very knowledgeable about the menu - we needed help.  The fifth star is for the prices - for the quality of food, the prices are a downright bargain - I really don't know how they do it as this is obviously the high rent district.  We come down often from Portland, which has many fine restaurants where we regularly spend a lot more money (listen folks, we're talking Maine vs. Newbury St.) for food that is rarely as good as this meal.

I love to know that the restaurant cares about what their patrons think. Here's an excerpt from the email:\\n\\n\\n\\"Hi Malika, this is Bill Streck. I am the Operating Partner of Cypress.  I appreciate you taking the time to review your experience, even though it wasn't a pleasant one. I take these reviews extremely seriously and use them to better our business.  I work hard in there every day, trying to make sure our customers are happy and that we put out a good quality of food and customer service.  I started Cypress from the ground up, and I really do care what our patrons think about my place of business.\\n\\nI definitely didn't like to hear that you did not get what you expected when you came to Cypress on Saturday night.  I wanted to address some of the concerns/complaints that you had with us to help better ourselves as a business and to make it a more pleasant experience for you as the customer.\\n\\nSending out food that is not up to par is not acceptable in my eyes.  You said the meatball sliders were disgusting?  This is a big concern for me because they are one of our best sellers.  Did you let the server know that the sliders you ordered were not cooked to your liking? We would have taken them back with no question and replaced them with a fresh order OR let you pick out another appetizer.  This is definitely unacceptable service and I will make sure that we avoid this situation from happening again.  We want you to feel comfortable and at home and also get great service and food while you are dining with us.\\n\\nAs for the small room, it does get cold in there in the winter because of all the glass and brick.  We are working on ways to solve the problem, because we want our guests to be comfortable when you are at Cypress.  This is a work in progress, so hopefully we can find a result soon.\\n\\nAhhh the dreadful smell that keeps popping up...yes, unfortunately that smell is given to us by the City of Atlanta.  Physically I can not do anything yet. We have complained to the city, but nothing has happened.  Luckily its not every day, and randomly shows up. I completely understand the complaint about this. This is something we battle with and wish I could do something to make it go away. Believe me. We will take suggestions...\\n\\nWe have been working hard at offering a good selection of beer at a good price point.  Right now we have 14 beers on tap and 40 bottled selections. We have a good selection of draft that stays around, but we also rotate new beers in weekly.\\n\\nWe are not trying to compete with Taco Mac or Porter Bar by any means.  We are just a neighborhood bar trying to offer our patrons a variety of beer.  We do carry a lot of limited released beers, so once they are gone, we have to replace it with a new selection.\\n\\nAgain, I am sorry your experience with us was not up to par.  We do pride ourselves in our customer service and trying to make sure we are suitable for the neighborhood. We would hate to lose you as a customer and a friend.\\""},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Waited 35 minutes for one of the most underwhelming burgers I've had in recent memory.

The first time I tried to come during the soft opening and it was packed with a line to the door. They ran out of ramen at around 9:30, but for some reason they didn't announce this to the line and I only found out by catching a conversation between a disgruntled couple as they left. I came again today, determined to try it out.\\n\\nWARNING: The wait is and probably will be ridiculous for the next couple weeks. It took about 20-25 minutes to get to the front to order and then the wait for our ramen was about 30 minutes (almost an hour). If you're planning on coming in the next week or two, expect long waits, especially since their hours are cut short to 5-10pm (instead of the intended 11am-10pm). \\n\\nThe place is a small (the hostess told us it sits 38 people), but we were told they were planning on placing tables outside to expand a bit. When we went in the ac was either broken or just set at a high temperature because it was quite hot inside. The place is pretty nicely decorated with a more modern Japanese feel and touches of Austin's weirdness here and there, but onto the food.\\n\\nThey ran out of the tonkatsu shoyu when we got up there, but that was fine with us as long as there was other ramen bowls available. My friends and I got the tonkatsu original, a friend of mine also got the curry bowl on the side, and I got the chashu bowl on the side. HEADS UP: If you get a ramen bowl \\"combo\\" you can get a couple side items that become $1 cheaper with the combo (i.e. the chashu bowl by itself was $5, but became $4 with the ramen bowl).\\n\\nChashu Bowl - pork belly over rice with pickled ginger and green onion. This dish was pretty good, but a bit on the salty side. Also, the pork was more on the dry side so some bites had a mealy consistency. The pickled ginger was sweet and had a nice kick to it I enjoyed. I don't think this would be a bowl I'd order consistently, but it was decent.\\n\\nTonkatsu Original - First things first; the broth. The broth was awesome. There was a deep, savory, salty, porky flavor to it that just made the dish. I've actually tried to make legitimate ramen broth twice and from first hand experience, it's no easy feat to get this seemingly simple broth right. The noodles were alright. I enjoyed them, but I felt like they should be a little chewier. The pork belly was literally melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The hard boiled egg was cooked perfectly with a soft silky egg yoke. However, what really made it was, again, the broth. I was really tempted to pay the $1.50 for extra noodles to eat with the remaining broth, but ended up just sipping at it.\\n\\nALSO: Don't be afraid to slurp loudly. Forget your provincial notions of table-side etiquette. The owner wants you to have an authentic experience and a way of showing appreciation in Japanese culture is to slurp loudly when you're enjoying ramen. Furthermore, the intake of air accents flavors in the ramen you wouldn't get if you were to tepidly chew at the noodles and daintily sip at the broth. In short, let yourself go a little and have fun eating this dish. =] \\n\\nOh... and I think Ramen Tatsu-ya ramen is better than Kome ramen (fighting words).\\n\\nI definitely would come here to eat again. I wish the place wasn't so popular though, as the wait for ramen is a bit ridiculous right now. This place is cramped, is way too hot to be called indoor seating (this time around), and has an hour long wait, but the food leaves you satisfied and feeling good. That's when you know it's a pretty damn good bowl of ramen."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been to Se7en bites twice now and about four bites into my order, I'm full.

My horror is amplified by the fact that this restaurant is so well-reviewed by others. These two factors have led me here to Yelp, to post my first restaurant review ever. Myself, my sister, and my two cousins were visiting Harvard and decided to eat at this restaurant since we had heard so many good things about it. We placed our order upon entering, attempting to order a beer, but three staff members couldn't get the tap to pour correctly. We changed our orders to lemonade. The rosemary fries were really quite tasty. The rest of what we got was literally the worst food I have ever eaten in 30 years of life on earth. My cousins ordered the chickpea platter. Everything on their plate, except for the chickpea fritters (which were okay) tasted like water. The cucumber salad was at least several days old, and had a fermented taste to it. The hummus, also watery, tasted like nothing - almost like sand ground into a paste. The pickles tasted like nothing - not salty, not vinegary.  The coleslaw was sitting in its own filth - a deep watery grey lake of nothingness. If anything, I would say it tasted a bit like gasoline. My meal - the seitan plate - was even worse. The seitan (I will post a picture) looked like a piece of discarded liver that you would feed to your dog - with a few pieces of onions stuck to it. I can't even think about it again without feeling sick. The pickles and the pickled cabbage was flavorless and watery. The potato salad was grey - actually GREY - but was the only thing on my plate that tasted somewhat okay. Having said that, it looked like it had been sitting out for at least 5 days (unrefrigerated). Overall, my family and I were so shocked by our experience here that it became almost humorous. We all had to throw out our food, and go out for lunch #2.

Compared to the scumbags next door in the pizza place, she was a friggin angel!

Presentation is nice, you get six very nicely sized pieces. The sauce is somehow subtle, but very good. Very good item.\\n\\nWonton soup- very light colored broth, we thought it was going to be bad, but it was delicious!! We were shocked, great job!\\n\\nOther Items:\\n\\nEgg rolls...solid New York style egg rolls...maybe .50 too much\\n\\nBoneless ribs- not the best, but very solid.

You have the option of dining inside or outside with the view is the lake and fountain. \\nThe only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because they do have an issue with overcharging/undercharging for items. As said earlier I usually get a small coffee and a croissant with butter and a side of jelly. Sometimes I pay $4.00 and sometimes I pay over $5.00. It really depends on who is ringing up your order.

They didn't taste very shrimpy, but they were also supposed to contain vegetables and garlic and I just couldn't taste anything but mush.

When I had finished my boyfriend's water, he still didn't offer more. I had 2 empty glasses sitting in front t of me. I had to flag him down for a refill. I wasn't drinking anything else, btw.\\n- Ordered a banana split and it was missing the berry sauce the menu mentioned, possibly whipped cream (not sure if that comes with it), and by the time the bartender walked it over to us, it was mostly melted probably because the tub of ice cream was sitting out on top of the freezer. He did not give us spoons so we ate the melted split with forks.

This could have been pretty serious had it been swallowed. She immediately told the manger who never approached the table.

Cured's Cheese, meat and produce selection is very specific and offers many unique options while not creating an overwhleming experience.  Within a few minutes I had tasted various traditional old world cheeses from various new world producers, and many meats from local producers to pair with those cheeses.  While other shops in town have many of the same cheeses, Cured has made the best effort at service and education I have seen - something I value at this level.  \\n\\nI do think my recent experiences are more representative of what Cured will offer.

I suggest going on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning.\\n- If you want to be first on line, yes, you do have to be there at 6 am.  You will still be waiting 5 hours til opening time at 11 am, but you will also be done sooner and avoid most of the afternoon heat.\\n- They allow alcohol consumption on site- even extending into the parking lot.  Everyone seemed to have gotten the memo with their coolers of beers.  If not, there is a CVS close by that sells 6 packs.\\n- There are foldable chairs stored under the staircase for your use.  Use them and return them once you reach said staircase.\\n- Sunblock, unless you are part of the lucky place in line that's covered.  Otherwise, you will turn into a lobster.\\n- Make friends on line.  It HELPS to pass the time.  Mostly, people were friendly, chatty and equally as thankful for the conversation.\\n- The staff will come out to update you on dwindling amounts of meats left.  The ribs seemed to be the first to go.  Everything else had decent numbers left even after we were served.\\n- If you have the $ to spare, as a fellow Yelper clued me in on, offer it to someone to hold a place on line for you.

Are we not here to fatten up?\\n3. Pulled pork- Wish we had abstained from this item.  It was DRY.  No sauce on the planet could help it.  After everything else was almost cleaned up, our heap of pork was left barely touched.\\n4. Potato salad- FUCK this.  Though it sounds tempting to break up the palette with a non- meat item, you are in fact, filling yourself up.  The salad had a tart taste, not my favorite approach to this.\\n5. Sausage- SURPRISINGLY, my favorite item.  These plump links were juicy and flavorful!\\n6. Bourbon Banana Pie- Yes, great end of the meal.  It was oddly refreshing and cut the saltiness of the meats. \\n\\nThough the meats were of an undeniably superior quality, I was not a fan of the dry rub used to marinade it all.

Afterward, their are both condiment and topping bars around.\\n\\nThe restaurant is EXTREMELY hectic, so it may be hard to find seating if you're with a large group, as I was. \\n\\nFor such a hectic environment though, I think the restaurant does a solid job.

I don't know, but the crawfish was not what I expected and it was actually kind of a pain to eat.   The crabcake was delicious though so I definitely recommend it.\\n\\nMy only issue with the restaurant is that the prices seem to be a little over what their true fair price would be.  Average entree runs in the mid $20s to $30s even though there were 2 or 3 that were priced in the teens.  But when you have so many other delicious choices such as the horseradish-crusted salmon, who in their right mind would go for the fish & chips?  But once again, you end up spending a little over $100 just to have a basic 2 entree with app. type of meal.\\n\\nSo definitely go to Jake's if you want some delicious seafood but also aren't shy about spending money on food."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Excellent service during busy lunch & fantastic blackened swordfish tacos let me eat healthy and ENJOY!

I will say, if you like Texas barbecue, this certainly would fit the bill.\\n\\nWe started with the potato skins, which were actually the most disappointing thing we had. They are totally fine except that the cheese is literally runny cheez wiz type sauce. It's not melted cheese or even thick cheez wiz. It was so runny that you could not pick up a potato skin and just eat it because the sauce would all run out everywhere. They had to be eaten with a fork and knife. Fortunately, from there, things improved.\\n\\nI had the pulled pork sandwich, which I recognize is not really a Texas barbecue go-to, but I just prefer it after seven years living in the Carolinas. It was fine, nothing special. The fried okra was completely on point and very tasty, and the mac and cheese was just what you'd want... large shell noodles swimming in cheese sauce. My friends both got the brisket and reported it was good.

Seating was comfortable and the restaurant is pretty spacious so you're not on top of each other. The server was extremely welcoming and pleasant. We was greeted by every staff member including the GM and store manager which gave the place and comfy feel. As people (regulars as we learned) begin to stroll in, things were no different. You started to feel like you were on an episode of Cheers, haha. We ordered the MexiCali omelette and blue corn hotcakes w/ a side of applewood bacon with an OJ and coffee to wash it down. The MexiCali was really good and loved the way it was prepared. Not too much egg just a thin layer enough to wrap all the goodness inside. The omelette was light, fluffy and stuffed with bacon, avocado and hash. The blue corn hotcakes have to be among the best cakes I've eaten in the city very fluffy and light so it didn't feel like a load of brick at the bottom of your stomach which is always a true PLUS in my book. The last thing you want to feel is weighed down with food. You could definitely taste the difference compared to buttermilk or buckwheat pancakes. I'm a fan of blue corn. The coffee is on the strong side, but a good floral undertone to the brew. They also offer a variety of coffee even though I went with a regular brew. The OJ was freshly squeezed and not overly sweet which is my style. The ambiance is quite nice with plenty of natural light coming in the place with eliminates the need for direct lighting around you or in your face.

Consistently good quality at reasonable prices. I love me some Eggs Benedict on a Sunday morning but care little for runny yolks. Other places often disappoint me, at least every other time, when I ask for hard poached eggs on my Benny. Not so Paul's. It's always right on the spot and their signature cheese sauce, instead of regular Hollandaise, is a nice twist. Service is always friendly and the wait never very long, even when it's insanely busy, which it usually is. They even make their own hot sauce, which goes great with the pan-fried potatoes (which I personally prefer to hashbrowns any day). Used to go there primarily when I got fed up with the long lines on Main Street. But they're definitely moving away from a second-choice and continually upwards on my list preferred breakfast spots.

Even on a weekday, this place was crowded and almost every table was full.\\n\\nSince lunch service hadn't started yet (10:30am), we went with the breakfast menu. The menu is pretty extensive and reasonably priced. We ordered the following:\\n\\nPraline bacon waffle ($9.50): this waffle literally left me speechless. I have no words. It is the single most delicious brunch item I have ever eaten. The waffle is light and fluffy and topped with an ample amount of whipped cream and praline nuts, which add a delicious nutty crunchiness and slight sweetness. With the included maple syrup poured over, it is simply an explosion of flavor. The best part, however, is combining the bite with some of the thick-cut bacon that is included. This isn't just any bacon - it is crusted over with an ample layer of praline nuts and caramelized with some brown sugar. The salty richness added by the crunchy bacon is simply delicious. The portion size is also huge, and can be split among two people (although it is so good you might want it all to yourself).\\n\\nStrawberry rhubarb bread pudding ($6.95): again, huge portion size and a delicious dish. This came with two large squares of vanilla bread pudding, with roasted strawberries and rhubarb on top and fresh whipped cream. I love that the bread pudding was neither too tart nor too sweet, which is hard to do when working with rhubarb and sugar. It was warm and chewy and creamy, and absolutely divine.

I've lived in the Portland area for 15 years and my husband, all of his life so it's sad to say this but we have never been to Jake's!  \\nTo make a long story short, we had the best food, the best waitress and the best dessert!!!  The waitress took the time to tell us what was fresh and what wasn't, made helpful suggestions based on what we were in the mood for.  She was friendly & attentive but not fake and all up in our bidness - bonus!\\nThe seafood was super flavourful and delish!!!  I had a scallop/shrimp dish, hubby had some new orleans type of dish, my father in law had salmon, mother in law got a stuffed something rather.  I know it sounds bad that I can't recall the names but OMG, each dish was great!  Although, mine won best plate of the evening...again, can't recall the name but look for the scallop/shrimp dish.   \\nThen to top it all off - I tried the Chocolate bag for dessert...this was one of the best desserts I've ever had.  It wasn't heavy, very light, but yet it was ginormus in size and one of the best desserts I've ever had.\\nDefinitely pretty expensive but it was a birthday dinner so you can't really put a price on that and luckily my in laws paid! :0)  Bottom line is, that we'll definitely go again and next time we'll hit up the happy hour that everyone keeps talking about.

If there were a high school cafeteria INSIDE a prison, maybe this is what the food would taste like.  My chicken wrap was so salty (chicken was sliced lunchmeat, not breast fillet) I could almost feel my arteries harden at the table, but I could distract myself from this by trying to discern whether it was the lettuce or the tomato that tasted like I licked the goo from the bottom of a refrigerator drawer.  The meat (if it was indeed originally from an animal) in my wife's gyro looked like reconstituted, gellified cardboard slices sprayed with lard.  Place was dirty, staff was disinterested.  I haven't eaten food this terrible in years, and even then it was likely under the duress of having no other options.  Sure there's a big photo of the founder on the wall stating you can return for a refund or they'll make you a new one.  This reminds me of when a cruise line has an ebola outbreak onboard, and they offer you another free cruise as compensation.  This is a waste of retail space in this location; I give this place another 6 months.  Looks like this is a franchise business...I'm sure whoever started this company years ago is long since given up on making it good and is now harvesting the franchise model from his yacht somewhere to a bunch of unsuspecting individual store investors that think they've gotten in on the next Subway.   Subway is Delmonico's compared to this place.   My wife laughed when I said after eating half the sandwich that my body would be better off if I cut my losses and went into the bathroom to barf up the portion I had eaten.  Now it's 2 hours later and I truly regret NOT actually having done that.  Don't go here...just don't.  If you're going to eat total junk, at least go to McDonalds where there's some semblance of quality control.

I'm boring and get the chicken salad with ranch - it's freaking killer ranch though....I want to dip everything into that stuff!  These guys know what they are doing when it comes to BBQ, hands down the best in the ATL.  They also participate in a lot of community events and support and donate to local charity events which I appreciate.   The mac and cheese, green beans, bbq chicken, and pork are all killer.  About 15-20 bucks per head depending on your order.\\n \\nMy only complaint here is that the servers can be really inflexible and they definitely (understandably- I get it, I waited tables, but.....) are not very accepting when you bring in large parties later in the evening.  We do dine late, but we will take care of the server and not sit there all night....however these girls are particularly side eyeing and seem to like saying no...and we don't order alcohol which I am sure is unnerving for the thought of their tip percentage.  Regardless, it's not cool.  My people are always kind and understanding, and never rude. I for one can be high maintenance but I'm nice about it and tip well as long as I'm not getting a snappy eye-rolling attitude from the server.

Meaty pieces of fried fish, with tartar sauce, and cole slaw to top it off, in a buttered bun... all for about 5 bucks! Pro was that it was a good portion, but con that it was lacking in flavor a bit. So, I asked for me tartar sauce. And then scoped out their condiments, and added a bit more relish and a pickle. I'm a real sucker for condiments, and  they had these marinated/pickled onions that were soooo good! They really need to make a Mexican version sandwich/entr√©e or something b/c that taste really made me crave some Mexican food.

They have an amazing $8.95 brunch deal in which you get unlimited tea or coffee, a small starter, and an entree off a preset list. I've been here twice now, both times on Sunday with a large group of people. I get the plantain empanadas which come with a cinnamon cream cheese dip that is to die for. The eggs benedict is right up my alley, it doesn't come with canadian bacon, but with avocados! I don't eat pork, so not having to substitute out components of an eggs benny always makes me happy. Instead of an english muffin they use a biscuit which I prefer over an english muffin. Finally it's topped with a green chile hollandaise that's got a little bit of a kick to it, but I kind of wish it'd be bumped up a notch.\\n\\nThe bloody mary's (the best part of any brunch) are about the same price as the entire brunch deal itself and could be spicier and better overall, but I still drink it because brunch without a bloody is sacrilege. I'd actually recommend just getting the food here and going down the street to Fritz for their bloody's if I'm being completely honest.\\n\\nThe service here is kind of spotty, it often takes the waitress a long time to give us our check, to come back and take our check, and to bring us our cards back. I'd say waiting to leave takes about as long as the entire eating portion of brunch. However, the wait staff is always incredibly pleasant. The most recent time I was here the water glass I was given was disgustingly dirty, I have no idea how someone even put it on the table in the first place. When I asked for another glass, the one I was given was also dirty.

Same with the wait staff.\\n\\nSince others have reviewed all of the items I've had over the years, I won't waste the white space.

The bar is small, but certainly suitable for a party of 6 for pre-dinner cocktails.  The restaurant is posh, intimate and romantic, but if you want real intimacy at dinner, ask to be seated in the wine cellar.  It's a 'secret\\" room downstairs where you definitely have the option of dining by yourself.

We got there a little bit before 7:30, which made us be in the first wave of people allowed in. That said, you probably could have shown up at around 8:30 and still have been some of the first people in. I really enjoyed the brisket, the sausage, and the ribs. This was my Texan friend's first time in Franklin's and he told me that not needing to put any sauce on indicated good brisket. The pies were also fantastic and a nice surprise. Btw, you don't need to wait in line for these. You can just buy them and take them to go.\\n\\nAll that being said, I don't really think I can justify the wait and this has nothing to do with the establishment itself, but rather the gigantic following it has amassed due to social media, news, etc. The brisket probably is the best, but when you think about it, what you are paying for and waiting for at Franklin's is the mastery of the pitmaster. The ingredients are just high-quality brisket, salt, and pepper, but the vast majority of people don't have the time nor the skills to make it that good. Therefore, there are a number of places not just in Texas, but also in Austin that are amazing. La Barbeque is an example that is also amazing, but has a much smaller line. I doubt that most of the people who go to Franklin BBQ would be able to seriously tell the difference. \\n\\nSo basically, Franklin is incredible, but you only go to say you've been and for the experience of waiting in line. With ordering online, that's another reasonable option now though, but make sure you do it about a week in advance. If you want incredible barbeque in general though, you don't need to go here and you're doing yourself a major disservice. There are other amazing places that deserve recognition as well. When I was in line, I was surprised to hear so many New Zealand and British accents. There's a ton of tourists and the line is probably a reason why the number of locals is not as large as one would imagine.

Surprisingly, it was a lot more bland than I had hoped for, although I will say that it was juicy and sizeable. But flavor is what matters most to me. It was lacking.

Well, a few days ago I had the chance.  It's a small shop, more geared towards take-out although there is counter seating for eating in.  I ordered the steamed pork buns and pork fried rice.  I consider fried rice to be a pretty good barometer of how good a Chinese restaurant is.  Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with either of the items I ordered.  The fried rice was fresh, but bland.  It didn't have nearly the flavor I expect from fried rice.  The pork buns were also bland and the flavor was a little strange to me.  They are stuffed with some type of pureed pork (presumably) that's a little bit sweat.  Not at all what I was expecting. Maybe this is the traditional flavor and I'm just uneducated in the intricacies of Dim Sum, but I wouldn't order it again.  All in all I'd say, try it if you're in the area and have a craving for Chinese, but temper expectations."},{"name":"Sushiemon","address":"201 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food is cheap for the great quality.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Sometimes when you are looking for a good piece of meat, there are places that make you want to slap your mother... this place comes pretty darn close to that, I'd probably slap a stranger, but damn the food here is tasty. \\n\\nI love good BBQ, from gas station joints in Kansas City, to a shack in the middle of the Texas pan handle, I have tried my fair share.  Here, there is something just tasty about the food.  Let's discuss why you want to wait around a bit, in the sweltering heat, to put a little Fox Brother on your plate. \\n\\nFirstly, this place has the atmosphere of a joint that will service you well.  The servers are all genuinely sweet and dedicated to the art of customer service.  Our server came out multiple times, to make sure we were good, mindful we were in a group of 20+ people, our server was diligent enough to remember all our orders, our drinks and everything else.  She was brilliant, also, helped us split the orders accordingly.  Sweet Tea in hand, drinks for others; we had plenty of attention from the staff here, and just the right amount too.\\n\\nThe Food.  \\n\\nI had myself the DC plate, with three meats and two sides.  It was the running order for most of our table, however we all selected different meats.  Mine was the Ribs, Brisket and Pulled Pork, with Mac and Cheese and The Fox Brothers Chili.   \\n\\nLet's review... \\n\\nRibs.  On this plate, I got 5 good sized ribs, and they were perfect.  They pulled gently off the bone, and didn't need a lick of sauce.  You could see the bark and the color was a shade of brown/mahogany/darkness that you wish you could see on all your food.  It was an authentic Smokey sweet flavor and permeated the meat, I almost I could eat the bone.. ALMOST. \\n\\nBrisket.  I asked for it chopped, and knowing I was going to get a piled mess of meat, it was DELICIOUS.  Perfection on a slice of white bread, to mop up any of the sweet juice meat. Did I say Sweet, I meant Savory heaven.  It was juicy and tender, and full of flavor.. again, no sauce required, it was just flavored right, and I'm sure smoked for hours and hours, to get it's great color tone.  My buddy next to me got the sliced, and the color rings were glorious, artful.  Yeah, I'm using all sorts of analogies; but the simple matter was, it was I feel the best meat on the menu. (given my limited experience, but you know what I mean).\\n\\nPulled Pork.  Like many out there, sauce was required for this, but even on it's own, it was delicious.  It shredded nicely and there was juice to be had,  I threw some into my chili and even into my mac and cheese, and it was probably the best combination of flavors I could have asked for.  \\n\\nAnd the sides... Mac and cheese... what is Cheese and Pasta Shells... it was good and tasty,  They were small, but honestly, you don't want a huge side because the focus should be on the MEAT.. MEATY awesomeness. \\n\\nSo should you come here, Yes.  Should you wait in line, Yes.  Should you get a few friends, and head down here, and just enjoy fine BBQ eating, Hell Yes."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"i have visited screen door twice in the past 8 years.  i don't get it.  the food is fine.  not spectacular but not bad.  it's a follow the follower kind of concept.

He's very nice and made my group some good sized sandwiches. From what I saw there is plenty of seating there, and he takes credit cards, so his setup is very accommodating.\\n\\nThe only problem I had is that both my pulled pork and brisket sandwich was really dry. I'm not saying that it was a tad dry, but really dry. I'm guessing that it's probably a better idea to go for lunch when its a bit fresher, but other than that I had a good experience there and really want to try it at an earlier hour.\\n\\nThey have a really good house sauce which is known as \\"espresso\\" barbecue sauce.  Dipping my sandwiches in their sauce did remedy the dryness a bit, but I also got some potato salad and beans to mix up my meal with. This may sound like a lot but I only ate 1 1/2 sandwiches and the side \\"singles\\" that they sell are not tiny, but they are small. \\n\\nSo in the end, I am looking forward to trying this place earlier, as I'm sure it will be better."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"WORTH.

They know it's a wait so they have a cocktail server coming outside selling beers and sodas, plus they provide about 20 chairs for the outside line.  That's right, the outside line.  Don't think you're off the hook yet when you approach the door!!  When you finally make it around the last corner, the staff is extremely friendly and generous.  I tried the brisket, sausage, ribs, and pulled pork.  Don't get overwhelmed by that list ... they'll give you as little as one rib bone :) I can't say it enough .... it was by far the best BBQ I have ever tasted.

They definitely do some creative rolls that are adventurous and fun! I was able to ask them to remove the avocado, and they have a decent section of cooked food which is harder to get wrong. I like their edamame options, and they do have a great happy hour menu for weekday lunches or early evening.

I didn't care for the sausage or ribs at all, and I found the potato salad and coleslaw to be inedible.  I just decided not to eat it because it did not taste good to me at all.  So disappointed!  I'm not one to write unfavorable reviews, but this really was a big let down for me based on other BBQ I've had in Texas.

The sangria was very tasty, sweet, and quite strong - we kept our tally at just one sangria because one of us was driving back and we didn't want to end up on the 11 o'clock news.\\n\\nService was friendly, but regrettably not very quick. There were only three servers in the bar area, and they all had to deal with a surge of post-work patrons coming in for a drink or a meal. The servers actually make the drinks themselves, which means they're not focused on just taking your order and serving your food - they're also mixing away and pouring drinks. This means that it takes me forever to get a server's attention. We waited half an hour just to pay the bill - eventually I gave it to who looked like the shift manager or the restaurant manager, and he took care of it for me.

This review is more for me, like a badge of honor you get once you've waited in the line up. We took some out-of-towners here and waited 3 hours in some of the coldest, wettest weather Austin could get. It was miserable--even the Canadians were bitching and moaning--and yet totally worth it for that brisket.\\n\\nDid it feel more worth it because we suffered so much beforehand? I'll never know. All I know is that first bite of brisket nearly brought me to my knees. It's very rich, though, so I got full super fast, pushed past my comfort zone, because we'd ordered way too much, and felt sick the rest of the day. Then it felt a little less worth it. \\n\\nI will say that although we enjoyed everything we ate, the only thing that felt worth the lineup and like you truly couldn't get it anywhere else was the brisket. Now, I am a brisket gal, and not into ribs or pulled pork (both of which we got, along w sausage), but even the bigger meat eaters in the group said the same. In the future, to avoid getting the meat sicks, we will just get the brisket. The sausage was tasty, and I like sausage, but it was very heavy/fatty, and I couldn't finish a full link. \\n\\nThat brisket, though. Amazing bark, flavor like nothing else I've had (I've done Rudy's, Ruby's, Salt Lick, La Barbecue, Black's...etc), and it quite literally melts in your mouth. \\n\\nSince I'm a sweets over meats girl, I would go back there just for those little pies - banana bourbon and key lime being my faves. If you like your dessert, it's worth it to get one or two of these. They're only 4 inches and you can split it among the group and just have a few bites like we did. \\n\\nOnly side we had was potato salad, which was great and really mustardy, but if it's your first time, I'd suggest limiting side consumption or you'll quickly be feeling too stuffed to eat your prized meat (which you'll pay a lot for, and quite likely over-order). \\n\\nOne thing I wish I'd known before: If you get there early, there are plenty of lawn chairs stored under the stairs for use so you don't have to cart your own."},{"name":"Steveston Pizza Company","address":"3088 Cambie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"5","text":"Really?

But the quality of a steakhouse is the steak, no? All the other iniquities can be forgiven with the promise of quality meat.  There is a lack of variety in the meat selection, offering only 7-10 cuts. The garlic sirloin tastes okay but was sinewy and tough even when medium rare. Top sirloin is acceptable, and they serve fall-apart alcatra, and Lamb sirloin is a rare find.\\nHowever, we requested lamb chops -rare- and they were served well. The seasoning was well enough, but we told our waitress about how overcooked the lamb was and she promised another rack. We waited patiently and the lamb chops were served overcooked again.

I was really impressed with the taste and how filling it was however the star of my meal was most definitely the cheesy hash browns! Wow, talk about amazing, if you like cheese I would recommend that you try them! \\n\\nThe Nutella Turbo consisted of Nutella with espresso and condensed milk and I believe regular milk as well, it was good and I was glad that I got it.

The tostada was served with rice and beans. While on that subject, the rice and beans were both served room temperature. God only knows when they were actually cooked and why they were not served HOT. Someone in the kitchen really needs to get a safeserv certification as they would learn what temp foods need to reach and stay at to be served properly. My husband's burrito had the same cold rice and beans.

I concur with the basic food safety stuff, you can also ward against problems with wet beans in bulk by using a small amount of Epazote and cinnamon (so little you don't even taste it) as that prevents bacterial growth for 7 days if properly refrigerated, but proper temps and times are #1 so you don't have a bad #2.  That all said, as my wife mentioned, the spicing is just right on the carne asada however you do want to go with flank or tri-tip, not top round.

I thought it would be fun! I thought the food would be edible! No and no. First of all, we went to this because we have a 4 year old son who likes pirates. We got tickets ahead of time online so that we could save $83 (!). The website says to get there an hour and a half before the show. This is only so that you will be stuck in a room with cheap pirate stuff to buy and drinks to consume. At one point a little bell rang and two people came out with trays of appetizers. The only vegetarian item they had was a tray of carrots and broccoli with ranch. The other stuff looked like chicken legs, meatballs, and cut up chicken nuggets. So then the \\"show\\" starts. Several \\"actors\\" come out and spin this tale about pirates and lost treasure and I don't even know what else. It was very confusing to me, so who knows what my 4 year old got out of that. Then they start organizing the crowd by color. You are assigned a color on your ticket. You line up according to color and follow your \\"pirate\\" (dressed in your color). You are then seated and your waiter comes by and gets your drink order. We had special vegetarian entrees ordered, so he made note of that. You get a choice of creamy veggie soup or a salad. We all got the soup, which was barely warm. Meat eaters get pork and chicken with rice and potatoes, I think, while us vegetarians got veggie lasagna with a whole package of frozen veggies sprinkled around the edge of the plate. I ate about half of my lasagna. It really felt like I was being punked. The good thing was my son was totally into the show and liked it. Oh yeah, there was a show going on while we ate. The pirate ship itself is really cool. Then at one point the lights came on and they announced an intermission. WE WERE ONLY HALFWAY DONE. So then the show starts again and they call all kids up onto the ship. My son went up and really loved that. They give you \\"dessert\\", which was a spoonful of \\"apple cobbler\\" and a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce. It was bad. I kept looking at my husband and shaking my head.

The same fries!!! Anyone with common sense (and an ounce of care or concern about food quality and/or sanitation) would make a fresh batch of fries to make up for the incorrect order. They would not re-fry old fries with condiments on them. Isn't that some sort of health code and/or sanitation violation?\\nAnyway, the fries looked pretty nasty after having been refried with condiments on them so I asked the waiter if these fries were actually a fresh, new order. The waiter lied to my face and said yes even though this was clearly not the case. Next, I went to the manager/owner and asked for fresh fries. \\nHe told me that he would not give me fresh fries because I \\"didn't write my order down correctly.\\" (Yes, you are reading this correctly.) First of all, of course I didn't write my order down, the waiter did. Second of all, she wrote it down incorrectly so how is this MY fault? The owner/manager argued with me back and forth about this as I stood at the counter in disbelief. I asked him if he was joking about blaming me for my order being made incorrectly and refusing to rectify the situation. He assured me that he was not joking at all.\\nThen, when I told him that re-frying old fries was unsanitary and unacceptable and I asked for a refund the manager/owner said NO! (Yes, you are still reading this correctly.) He refused to give me a refund for the old, re-fried fries that I was served because I had, according to him, \\"already eaten about 5 fries\\". Again, I asked him if he was joking about not issuing me a refund because according to him, I had \\"already eaten about 5 fries\\" and he assured me that he was not joking. I could not make this story up if I wanted to. After the shock of this crazy experience wore off, I promptly left the restaurant. \\nPlease, Yelpers, please DO NOT patronize this place.

After reading its menu and that it was supposedly inspired by South African cuisine, I decided to give it a try.\\n\\nFirst of all, the parking situation is a bit tricky as the entrance to their parking lot is not on W Paces Ferry.  It's actually on E. Andres across from the Regions bank.  They also have complimentary valet, meaning you can't go park it yourself (shakes head at the couple who were behind me in line and decided to \\"self-park\\" and almost ran me over with their SUV).\\n\\nThe restaurant setting is very upscale so I felt a little under dressed when i walked in with a polo and jeans.  But hey, they still let me in so I think it's all good.  The crowd at this restaurant is definitely older/more established type that live around the area.  So if that would make you uneasy, it may not be the best place for you.\\n\\nWe started our dinner with an order of the prawn taco.  I have to say even though i am not a fan of taco, it was amazingly good.  The ingredients were fresh and the sauce is just the right touch.  I think we should have ordered two of them.  We also ordered the pan mac & cheese since it looked so good in photos.  The verdict was that it was ok but not amazing.\\n\\nFor entrees, my wife order the grain bowl (has tuna in it) and I ordered the pasta with clams.  My wife loved her bowl because it was fresh, light but filling, and the tuna were of excellent quality.  I liked the taste and freshness of my dish but wished their portion was a bit bigger.  We ended the night with a piece of cheesecake and that was ok.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Their services and the ingredients are definitely top of the line and the dishes are refreshing.  My only complain is that their price tag is a bit higher than I would normally encounter but it is to be expected since it's in Buckhead."},{"name":"Charlie's Seafood","address":"188 Essex St","city":"Lynn","stars":"3","text":"Clean place, clean oil, no grease, no frills old school!

I was lucky enough to make a trip to LA to revisit then the following week visit Austin for a ramen showdown!\\n\\nBoth places i ordered pork ramen with extra pork and eggs. Broth, noodles, eggs and pork are excellent. There's just enough differences between the two.\\n\\nBroth - Daikokuya is thicker, rich and more savory. But a bit more saltier than Tatsu-ya. \\nNoodles - Tatsu-ya uses different noodles, less filling IMO. Both have the same tenderness and flavor.\\nEggs - Both were cooked just right, Carmel brown exterior with a mooshy semi cooked yolk. \\nPork - As a meataterian, the pork at daikokuya wins. I can't describe it, but after eating both, i can tell the difference.\\n\\nBetween the two, Daikokuyo wins. But as for in the Lonestar state.

I love a man in glasses) but that's besides the point. \\n\\nWhen we were still residents of Austin, we got up super early one Saturday morning to get in line but lived so far out that by the time we got there it was already around the block. We knew we didn't stand a chance so we decided we would take a random weekday off eventually and try again then. Low and behold a much better opportunity would come knocking later. \\n\\nA few weeks ago, a friend of a friend won a private dinner at a silent auction for charity and was looking for anyone who had an interest in attending. She was only asking the amount she paid per person and it included all you can eat meat, sides, dessert, wine, and beer. But the best part? No waiting in line and oh yeah, getting the place all to ourselves!!! (and yes of course that the money went to charity). \\n\\nWe were so excited to be invited to this once in a lifetime opportunity that we barely sat still waiting for the day to arrive. As people who were always on the outside looking in, it was trippy to be on the other side for once. We even got to take a special behind the scenes tour and see the room full of smokers where all the magic happens. It was unbelievably warm in there and most of them were shut off, so lets take a second to applaud the wonderful people of Franklin's who stand in the meat sauna for hours on end to produce such delectable food for us to enjoy. You guys are the best.\\n\\nAs for the brisket? As advertised you guys. Simply seasoned as it is, it was the best damn piece of meat I have ever put in my mouth. I know how that sounds but it's true! He deserves all the medals, awards, and bragging rights because now all other brisket has been ruined for me. \\n\\nThe other meats we tried (smoked turkey, pulled pork, sausage, and bbq ribs) were wonderful as well but all paled in comparison to the brisket. They only have 3 sides (beans, slaw, potato salad) plus the given pickles, onions, and white bread slices. They also have a few different bbq sauces, but I would never dare put a sauce on that perfection. \\n\\nCake and spoon provide the pies here and they too are incredible. I highly recommend trying the banana bourbon and pecan. You can also skip the line by ordering a fully cooked brisket to go in advance, but be prepared to sit on a waiting list for a few months to do so. \\n\\nThey have merch including tops, shirts, and even onesies that we made sure to stock up on also before leaving. \\n\\nIt was a phenomenal experience with both dynamite food and company.

Best bet is to go with a Chinese friend and/or practice your elbow-throwing, Chinese-accented-American-name-calling identification skills. \\n\\nTry the taro root bun cake (http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v712/Trikki427/1220571408.jpg).

That said, they pretty much have a stranglehold in terms of Mexican in the Allston area, so I will be going back despite some of the reservations I may have.\\n\\nThe decour is incredible.  Well, only if you were very familiar with Our House West, because, holy cow, I can't believe this is the same place.  It's all lit up, the bathrooms are now several grades above that of a fraternity/Crack house and there's an absurd amount of light.  It's very well done.\\n\\nThe food is quite good and I don't have much issue with it.  I'd have to say I'd recommend the enchiladas over the burritos or fajitas,  but go with whatever floats your boat.  They provide more of a black bean type paste than a normal serving of beans, and for whatever reason I'm just not as into the refried look.\\n\\nWhile you will most likely be happy with your food, it's shockingly expensive.  $13.50 for a burrito with onions & peppers?  The margin they're making must be absurd.  I had read this about the Gloucester/Saugaus locations while I was waiting for it to open, and I can't say I was surprised.  \\n\\nThey do provide complimentary chips & salsa, but I think they're losing a lot by not serving warm chips and the pico de gallo is nothing to right home about. I hate saying you can get something better at a place like The Border Cafe or On The Border, but that is my opinion there.\\n\\nThey do have some very solid drink offers there.  $2.50 drafts of Bud/Bud light will compete with any bar in the area to bring in your season college douchefaces.  They also have $3.00 Modelo Negras.  That's a pretty sweet offering.  As for the margaritas? I can't say I'm a huge fan.  They taste somewhat watered down and somethings  a bit off.  Like there's an extra liqueur added in that's a bit unsettling.   Not a huge fan.\\n\\nI've been 3 or 4 times and haven't had very good service.  It hasn't been that busy either.

We eventually ordered dinner and while the waiter took my order something being said at the next table caught his attention. He turned and stared and listened in for several minutes, completely forgetting what he was doing! I patiently waited for him to snap out of it, even looking at my friends to see if they saw what was happening. They did. it was very awkward and strange, but he didn't seem to notice!\\nWe ordered more drinks, some popcorn and salads to start, but after a very long while nothing had come out. Our server never came over to fill our water or just mention that they were busy and things were moving slowly. It would have been nice. I had to step over to the bar to enquire about our drinks etc. They apologized profusely and said they would send the waiter over ASAP. He came by and offered us a complementary round of drinks for the long wait. Salads and drinks finally came out, but the popcorn never made an appearance. We asked and were unapologetically told that they were out of popcorn! \\nAfter another very long wait we asked about our entrees and our waiter mentioned he had put in our order with the kitchen over an hour ago and hopefully it would be any minute! The food came out and was very good, as were the drinks and salads. That is not the problem at Mettle. \\nOverall we were there for more than 3 hours. Most of the time spent waiting a ridiculous amount of time for drinks and food with some of the worst service I have ever had."},{"name":"Super Fusion Cuisine","address":"54 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"Had a hankering for sushi since I moved to town but had'nt gotten my fix until I tried this spot.  Luckily my fellow sushi-loving friend was out to visit so we decided to give it a try.\\n  \\nWalking in, the place was a lot smaller than I expected.  Regular tables, no booths and youre practically sitting on top of other diners.  My friend and I had a good chuckle about the Backstreet Boys cd they were playing, it was fun to sing a long as we ate. :)  Very weird but provided some entertainment while we waited for our food.\\n\\nWaitress was nice and quick.  She reccomended the Lemongrass Hot & Sour soup for my friend who was seeking the thick  oily tofu laden version you get at other places.  I tried some of her soup and it was very fresh-tasting.  The broth had excellent flavor, and the broth had nice chunks of shrimp and lobster in it.\\n\\nNow for the rolls.  We ordered our usual tried and true rolls:  Philadelphia,Spicy Tuna, California, and finally Sweet Potato Tempura.\\nThe Philly was awesome, nice smoke flavor to the salmon.\\nSpicy Tuna was good but not the best I've ever had.\\nSweet Potato lacked that yummy brown sauce that I love so much, but was decent.\\nCali roll tasted fresh but there was Way. too. much. Tobiko.  unless youre into that.\\n\\nOverall, good experience, tasty sushi and decent prices.  I will be going back to try some more adventurous rolls!!"},{"name":"The Reef","address":"4172 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for dinner to catch up with a friend...she totally raved about this place.\\nLoved the Johnny cakes, I had the Tiger Malt and we had the share platter...everything was great, service was excellent and every time I come here, the music they play makes me feel like going to the Caribbean.

Sat at the sushi bar (no distinction between bar and sushi bar) and waited for service. After 10 minutes we asked for service, just to be told the sushi bar was closed. Just kidding! The host messed up and told the server it was. The truffle fries were amazing! service was slow, but not bad enough to not come back.

We sat outside at about 7 pm so the sun was going down but the patio was lit with night lights. Food was great and came out fast . I will say that the tuna on the salad nicoise  was a very well and we asked for medium rare. They fixed it but still wasn't what we expected, still good tho. Over nice comfy with good food and scenery.  This coffee was from the coffee with a kick menu and the name is pecan sandy . Very good!!"},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Alden & Harlow is a great place to bring a larger group and share a communal table. Also, it's a great option for vegetarians! The vegetable dishes we had were definitely standouts. At $13+ a plate, it's a good idea to try bites of everything and eat family-style. \\n\\nFOOD\\n---------\\n+ CHARRED BROCCOLI: The butternut squash buried under the broccoli is complete crack. The broccoli is cooked perfectly, not having too much of a crunch, but not overcooked. The two complemented each other really well.\\n+ SECRET BURGER: The pickles, secret sauce, and buttered house made roll accompanied by soooo many chips definitely makes this a standout burger. Last time I had this, I shared with my boyfriend and it was too much to eat with other entrees. This time around I had 1/5 of the burger and it was perfect. \\n+ MOOSABEC FARM MUSSELS: The corn and fregola pasta in the broth is pure genius. Instead of just slurping up your broth with your mussels, you get a bite that is savory and a little bit sweet from the corn. This is definitely my favorite mussels dish!\\n+ JAPANESE EGGPLANT: This is sweet, savory, and soft; a great twist on an eggplant dish!\\n+ PICKLED VERRILL CORN PANCAKES: The buttermilk and maple flavors are not too overpowering, but do make the popcorn on the pancakes soggy. However, I did like the combination of the somewhat crunchy and soft textures. \\n+ CHICKEN FRIED RABBIT: Perfectly fried. The blue cheese taste wasn't too prominent.\\n+ SWEET PEA & HUMMUS: Although it mentions hummus, it really just is a blend of sweet pea and hummus accompanied by bacon and croissant toasts. Ask for more toast if you are sharing with multiple people - it's a flaky, crunchy bite of toast and it's awesome.\\n\\nFor 5 girls, seven dishes was plenty. Our server recommended two plates per person, but I would've died in my seat if we ate that much. Each dish came out sequentially, with two dishes on our table at a time, which enabled our table to finish each dish as it was still warm."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Above all, the food is amazing. We had to wait for a while to get a table but it was worth it. \\n\\nWe ordered the omelette, pancakes and breakfast bagel. The omelette is the best one I ever had. They make like a thin layer and fold it like a crepe which makes it very tasty.

Three glasses of wine and a couple appetizers.  The lamb was much better than the duck, although the duck was good too.  Everything was ordinary.  At $150 walkout price I wouldn't go back.   A decent meal at a high price.  Decent service, but cramped quarters."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We ordered a lot of different meats and cheese fries and they were all really good. \\n\\nI'd have to say that their ribs were probably my favorite out of all the meats we got. I don't like sauce, but theirs were with a dry rub and it was delicious. The meat didn't necessarily fall off the bone, but it was almost there and I like it that way.  The brisket was ok, as well as the chicken wings. The pulled pork was seasoned nicely and tender. I also really liked their dark chicken meat. Very tasty and not dry at all. Toddler loved it which is always a plus.\\n\\nWe got mac and cheese for a side and cheese fries. Loved both of them and would order them again if I come back here.\\n\\nBottom line, go here.

Asked for 3 old fashioneds for my party of 4 and got a snotty reply saying \\"what kind? The $30 kind?\\" Aside from the insinuation that I couldn't afford a good drink, the bartender described herself as a \\"b*tch after 11,\\" and walked away. Shortly thereafter, I indicated to another bartender that I had been unable to obtain decent service from his colleague and asked again for 3 old fashioneds, immediately specifying the whiskey type this time. He refused to serve a member of my party who has a mental illness (but who is harmless, completely sober, and wasn't even going to be drinking alcohol), despite saying the member of my party seemed \\"polite\\" and despite me clearly ordering 3 drinks for a party of 4. We started to walk out and I noticed they had an air of humor about my party. I strongly expressed disappointment about how we were offended and left. \\n\\nI suspect they dislike customers who come by after the Garden, as they were quick to ask if we had been to a show. Kind of like the people who move next to a farm and complain about the smell. Except worse. Did I miss the memo? Is this place a cocktail bar affiliate of Dick's Last Resort? If so, you need a new business model.
