My friend asked the waiter to bring her \\"exactly what he's having\\" and I followed suit.  The waiter warned us the jerk chicken is spicy, and he was not kidding - but I love spicy, and this was spicy done to perfection.  The chicken was falling off the bone tender and, although I don't know this to be a fact, it seemed authentic Jamaican.  The plate also came with yellow rice, cabbage, and a couple of plantains.  The plantains were my least favorite part, and I usually LIKE plantains, but these were just super dry.  The cabbage was not all that exciting, but the rice was good - and PLENTIFUL.  My other friend ordered the curried shrimp with rice which she has been known to get and always enjoys.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal our waiter asked if we wanted one check or separate checks.  We asked for separate (since he offered), but there was some confusion because although there were 3 of us he only brought 2 checks (I guess because 2 of us had jerk chicken?).  Not a big deal though.  For a filling, delicious lunch it was $11 pp including tax & tip.\\n\\nThis seems like it would be great for takeout during the week when you just can't stand another sandwich or salad.

Check out my fancy word!) will love.  I won't make you Google what Cicerone is ok?  Basically, a Cicerone is to beer as a Sommelier is to wine...get it?  Anyway, The Flying Saucer prides itself in serving hundreds of different brands and styles of beer.  Everything from Belgian Trappist Ales to local brews, if they don't have what you want on tap, more than likely they'll carry it in a bottle.  Did you know there's such a thing as Barley Wine?  If you have any questions about beer, chances are their resident Cicerone or one of their many waitresses will be happy to point you in the right direction of their extensive menu.  Speaking of waitresses, don't let the plaid mini-skirts and bubbly personality fool you!  These gals know their beers and will be more than happy to give you a taste of beers if you're still unsure of what you're ordering.  \\n\\nIf you're REALLY in to beer, then you may want to join their \\"UFO Club.\\"  After drinking 200 beers (alas, only 3 pints count per visit...no beer chuggin' contest here), you'll get a plate with your name placed in their \\"Ring of Honor.\\"  You can keep going back for more plates too, so don't just stop at 200!  The Flying Saucer does serve food as well, and their \\"Kick Ass Chicken\\" sandwich really does kick some butt.  Try their bratwurst plates too, they're pretty tasty and so are their giant pretzels!   The inside of the place is your standard tables and booths place with that English pub feel to it.  This place gets very packed for happy hour and the crowd is a good blend of students and the young working hip crowd.  They do have events like Trivia night and Pint Night, so look on their calendar for all the latest happenings.  The patio area upfront is a great place to drink away a sunny Austin afternoon or evening and bring your dog, they're VERY dog friendly here.

The order said it would be here around 11:55 am. I made sure that I gave them my address correctly. I gave them the apartment number and my gate code so that they could get in. \\n\\nBackstory: I have finals in a week. I do not currently have time to cook or grocery shop, which is why I was ordering food. I had my phone on me until I started taking a 3.5 hour practice exam. At some point, I looked at the clock and I realized that my food was 40 minutes late.\\n\\nI checked my phone and I had missed calls from several different numbers with no voicemails or text messages. (They called at 12:20, 25 minutes after the food should have been delivered btw). Since I gave them the correct address and the gate code, and since I was sitting right next to my front door, there was no reason for me to think I needed to have my phone on me. I was assuming they could be competent enough to just get it here like every time I order food from another restaurant.\\n\\nAfter 30 minutes of trying to track down my food with eat24, (since no message was left and I didn't know which of the numbers belonged to who) the driver called me and told me that he had knocked on the door and no one answered so he left the food at the front door. He argued with me and then he also said that the gate code I gave him was wrong (SOUNDS LIKE A HINT YOU MIGHT BE AT THE WRONG APARTMENT COMPLEX, HMMM)\\n\\nI will concede that I should have answered the phone when they called, sure. But I'm extremely busy (as I'm sure most people who order delivery are lol) and I didn't know I had to babysit the delivery driver. There is no reason I should have had to. I did everything right on my end when ordering the food. \\n\\nThe driver\\n1. Should have gotten my address correctly. It's been confirmed that I gave them the right address. He made an error. \\n2. Should have wondered if maybe he was at the wrong address when the gate code I gave him didn't work and then I didn't answer the door. \\n3. Should have left a message when he called. You've called me from several numbers and left no message (some of the missed calls could be from someone else for all I know). How am I supposed to know what is going on? It took another 30 minutes to track down what happened to my food. It's been 3 hours since I tried to order food and I have none. I'm starving and not happy. \\n\\nI tipped you well and you can't leave a message or do a tiny amount of investigation? \\n\\nAnd the manager should have called me instead of a delivery driver who is just going to argue with me. \\n\\nThis level of incompetence is incredible. \\n\\nI've never eaten here before.

There was a lot of salt on the fish. I tasted a piece of my wife's red snapper and it had a very fishy taste that I did not enjoy. It was also salty. I like fish that doesn't taste like fish. For example, I like cod, tilapia, salmon, etc. I guess I don't like red snapper. It seemed that all the dishes had too much salt. The quality of the food was very good, but I didn't love the flavors.

We came here for brunch on Easter Sunday. And we were a group of 11. I'm not sure if it being a holiday actually hurt or helped us, service-wise, but I'm throwing it out there. Apparently, you have to arrive before opening time if you want to come for Sunday brunch here and want to get a table without waiting (but you are waiting, so I guess there's no avoiding the wait? Seems like a common Austin problem to me...). And we did indeed get seated right when the restaurant opened, so that was good.\\n\\nHowever, it took a long time for them to take our order, and about an hour and a half for them to bring our food. Keep in mind they basically have ten brunch options, and then you can also order sausages (of course, that's their specialty). I got the Benedict. It was pretty underwhelmed by it, and the \\"home fries\\" it came with were just crispy little slivers of what once was a potato. So disappointing. My boyfriend got the corned beef hash, which had like 5 little pieces of corned beef in it. Also underwhelming. We decided to get a drunken chicken sausage because it really wasn't a huge portion, and that was pretty good. Overall, food was meh and the service left so much to be desired.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very nice, though, and we loved that they had a live band that started playing at noon. We didn't stick around for too long, though, because we'd already been there for hours. If I was doing it again, I'd probably eat a little breakfast, and then come for lunch (don't come too hungry because, again, you'll wait a while) and enjoy the music while you eat.

We started with the house margarita, which was probably the best house margarita I've ever had, and the ceviche, which was also delicious. My mom had the pulpo especial prepared medium spicy and she thought it was spicier than she had hoped. I, on the other hand, was looking for a spicy dish and ordered the camarones cucaracha but these weren't spicy enough for me. Don't get me wrong, they did have a kick to them just not enough for this spice-loving latina. My hubby had the seafood pasta and, although he was initially skeptical to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant, he LOVED it (I did too, it was delicious!). I think we were too ambitious and still ordered sides - french fries and rice and beans but they, naturally, paled in comparison to the entrees so they went essentially untouched. \\n\\nNow, although I would've given them a 5-star review anyway, the most shocking thing for me was how they handled the iPad that we left at our table after lunch.  We went home, completely full and in a food coma ready to nap, watched TV, and simply assumed we'd left our iPad in the car. When my husband went to check hours later, it was nowhere to be found so I knew I'd left it at Alegria. However, we didn't have a password on it and it's wi-fi only so it wouldn't show up on the Find My iPhone app. With 15 minutes 'til closing time, I called frantically but got no response. My heart sank as I realized our lunch might end up costing us a lot more than we bargained for. Nevertheless, I drove towards the restaurant and messaged them on Yelp hoping for the best. To my surprise, the owner immediately replied to confirm that they did indeed have my iPad in their possession and would be happy to return it. Although it was after 9 pm when I arrived and they were technically closed, they were kind enough to open their doors so I could pick it up before the workweek begins and life gets crazy again.

Only after other patrons ordered did we gather that orders were to be placed at the counter. The second thing I noticed, as pointed out by my dad, was a strange smell. That's all I'll say about that. Our waiter repeated every word I said as if he was desperately trying to remember our order...which would have been alright if he wasn't obviously stoned. i'm just glad my parents found it entertaining. Maybe it was just the Bob Marley playing overhead that caused me to come to such a conclusion, i don't know. The appetizers we ordered were served in a way that was anything but appetizing....just kind of dropped on the table like salt packets. However, they were quite tasty. The grilled chicken dish that I was so looking forward to was unfortunately a disappointment. I won't say it was cold, but it was well on its way.

I just was not impressed. I got the clam chowder which was decent ...probably the best thing I got but a bit odd with carrot and octopus... So I ordered the fried chicken, greens and biscuit. The biscuit was perfect texture but has zero flavor - it was the strangest thing...you could have added sugar or salt to create a sweet or savory biscuit but adding neither....zero flavor. I tried to add jam but nope...did not help. The chicken coating was a bit odd and has this super sickly sweet honey all over it. The meat was super juicy but honestly also had zero flavor except for the coating. The greens were the best part of the plate honestly.

I don't know how they expect to get highway traffic if there are no signs for cars on Rt 139... guess they just want locals.\\nAnyway, my experience at Smokey Bones was alright, but nothing better than an average chain restaurant. Better than Olive Garden next door (I hate Olive Garden), but not nearly as amazing as Not Your Average Joe's down the street or TGI Fridays also down the street. Employees seemed very friendly, kind, and knowledgeable about the menu. \\nEven though the menu was a little different than I anticipated, I actually liked it. They didn't have outrageous prices, and the lunch offers were great. The layout of the restaurant was surprisingly good with the bar in a separate area away from each of the dining rooms. \\nFood was pretty good. The burgers are cooked a little different than I normally prefer, and the way they advertise the burgers on the menu is somewhat confusing as well. It was filling, but could have been more flavorful and less \\"burnt\\" in my opinion. I guess I would have to try other stuff to make a conclusive opinion upon their menu, but overall, everything seemed just average. For the prices of a regular eat-in restaurant though, it was underwhelming. \\nService was efficient and friendly, which was a big plus. Parking right around the building and for lunch, they seemed to be dead! Only a few tables filled. \\nIf you are wondering about the types of foods this place offers, it's a variety of burgers, wings, BBQ, seafood, and sandwiches. The \\"fire starters\\" are the best thing about this place. \\nI may come back, but it wasn't all that good enough to make another trip all the way to Stoughton again.

We had reservations for 8 at 8 (cool!) and were quickly taken to our table. We chose a bottle of the Chateau Brondeau Rouge 2011, which we enjoyed (so much we had another bottle later in the evening). As an appetizer we tried the mussels and they were fresh, plump, and extremely tasty (a creamy wine sauce that begged for crusty bread to sop). Most of the folks at the table took advantage of the Trois Plats (an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert for $36!). I got the Croque Monsieur au Saumon, which was a little like a grilled cheese that someone had put a little salmon in (and then cut into quarters) - and the plate was finished with matchstick pomme frites. Was not real impressed. However, the entree I got was the beef short rib bourguignon and that was fantastic! The meat was flavorful and exquisitely tender. The sauce/gravy was deep and rich and added to the meat. For this course we ordered a bottle of Justin Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 and it was deep and complex and really paired well with the beef. For dessert I had the apple tart and although I would say it was only ok, that was likely because I was so full from all that I had already eaten. If I had any complaint it would be that the portion sizes were more US size and not French size. I think they could have decreased the amount of food by 30 to 40% and it would have still been been a great dining experience. Lastly everyone who helped us while we were at the restaurant were super and couldn't have done a better job.

Let me just preface by saying that only after my THIRD (that's right) attempt, was I successful in experiencing all the smoked goodness at Wayne's! This was due to a combination of not being well-researched and bad luck. The first time, I arrived hungry & excited around 3pm (thinking Wayne's closed at 4pm), only to find a dark & closed shop with a big red \\"SOLD OUT\\" sign on the door. So here comes tip #1: go as soon as they open--they sell out FAST, and then proceed to close as soon as that happens! \\n\\nMy second attempt was on a Monday which was an epic fail; Wayne's isn't open for business on Sunday/Monday, so tip #2, don't be the idiot that can't read and show up on a day they're closed (like me). \\n\\nMy third attempt was-boy oh boy--absolutely incredible ! This place COMPLETELY lives up to the hype. The brisket is the best I've ever had--melts in your mouth and breaks apart at the lightest touch of a fork. The smoked turkey was so good I almost convinced myself to go buy a smoker right after my meal to attempt making smoked turkey for thanksgiving (who am I kidding?), and my guy was a huge fan of the pork ribs. Do yourself a favor and get here ASAP, although I'd skip the mac & cheese--somehow they managed to get this all the way wrong but ITS OK because the meat is HEAVENLY.

The setting of the place is perfect for a casual dinner with some excellent food and a great drink selection. \\n\\nWe started off the night with chips and queso/salsa. We got the happy our special so it was half off. Definitely worth it. The cheese dip was well done and the salsa was very fresh. It was a  perfect compliment for our beers. \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the Foghorn Leghorn. It was decent chicken salad, but I wish there was a little more to it. However, the sandwich came with pickled vegetables that took the sandwich to the next level. The homemade chips that also came with it were very tasty. My friends both got the Bacchus and absolutely loved it. The chicken was super moist and the ingredients perfectly complimented each other. \\n\\nMy only complaint about this place is the service. Looking a reviews before going, I was prepared for less than amazing service. However, I realized other reviewers were not exaggerating. The service is awful. The burned out waitresses were so low energy and were very inattentive (water was self serve so we at least made sure our glasses were full). The icing on the cake though was when the waitress was coming around taking the umbrellas out of the tables (we were eating outside), and literally went between us while we were eating, pulled out the umbrella, and had this brown much go all over our table. She said absolutely nothing and just kept going with her task. At least a \\"sorry\\" or some kind of acknowledgement would have been nice.  \\n\\nFinal thoughts: definitely check this out if you want a casual night out of food and drinking with friends.

Kaylee was our waitress and her knowledge of the menu was outstanding.\\n\\nWe decided to skip appetizers; I'm sure next time I'll try the kangaroo loin.  My date had the steak and said it was the best she'd ever eaten.  The meat looked like a perfect medium-well and was fork-tender.  I got the lamb and was rendered absolutely speechless.  I've had lamb prepared many different ways and from different cuisines, and this was by far the best.  The chop was perfectly tender and the medium-rare presentation was a deep, gorgeous red.  The ribs were falling off the bone with a sweet glaze (tamarind, maybe?).  The foie gras ravioli were delightful.  The presentation was almost too pretty to eat.\\n\\nFor dessert I had the mocha semifreddo (like the most decadent frozen mocha coffee you've ever had, x1000000) and she had the chocolate grotto, which we both agreed was the highlight of the meal.  \\n\\nThe wine list was impressive, offering one of the best Willamette Valley Pinot Noir I've ever had the good fortune to drink.

If you don't mind the drive, the experience is well worth it. I've eaten at Zoot on and off for more than 15 years, and I can honestly say that the current head chef and current pastry chef are the best the restaurant has ever had.\\n\\nIf you go, try the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. On our last visit, we started with an amazing (as in make-your-head-explode good) duck confit. The duck was a marvelous mix of crispy and salty goodness. The duck was followed by a nice, light salad of local greens that offered a good counterpoint to the rich duck confit. The next course was a snapper with a perfectly crisp and sightly salty crust with tomato and green olives. The textures were as good as the flavors. Next, we were served the New York strip with marinated peppers. This was the only flaw in an otherwise perfect dinner. The texture of the steak was odd--more like that of a roast than NY strip. The meat lacked any marbling to speak of. The taste wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I've had this at Zoot before and it was excellent, so I think we just got a poorly chosen piece of meat that night.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had a flourless bittersweet cake with hazelnut streusel. The dessert was as crazy good as it sounds. If you are an old fan of Zoot, you know that in the past, dessert was a bit of a disappointment. However, with the restaurant's new pastry chef, the desserts rival the entr√©es in tasty goodness.\\n\\nThe wine pairings that accompanied the tasting menu were perfect and complimented every dish served. As an aside, the wine list at Zoot is solid and the markup is reasonable.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, efficient, and attentive. I noticed that a couple of the other reviews mention less than perfect service, I wonder if those folks went on a weekend night during the rush. We typically go on week nights, and the service is always very good.\\n\\nOne minor gripe I have is that the bread served comes in the form of pretty bland, reheated dinner rolls. Would fresh, crusty bread be too much to ask?\\n\\nI do agree with a couple of the other reviews here in that the decore of the new location is a bit commercial and stark. I preferred the old location's warm and charming ambiance.\\n\\nOverall, Zoot is a wonderful restaurant for folks who love excellent food and wine."},{"name":"Nikki Sushi & Steak","address":"15135 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 145","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent sushi.

The waitstaff were fine, just not especially friendly. \\n\\nBut really, the food was pretty, meh. When we visited they had truffle infused French fries, with a really watered-down thousand island kind of dressing. The truffle flavor was very slight, the fries were completely average and the dressing was really mediocre.

The sweet potato gnocci and goat cream cheese on the side were far more interesting than the actual meatballs. Finally, we got some crab pizza, which to me was the most disappointing. It was like about $15, and I don't know, for pizza it just seemed pretty half-assed. It had some kind of white cheese, very little sauce, the crust didn't really taste like anything, and there was hardly any crab on there.\\n\\nSo, then we left thankfully, cuz the food just wasn't happening for me.

Everything was great - friendly staff, great oatmeal, pretty consistent with amout of toppings too.  There is a lot of oatmeal in their serving size so it makes a difference how much of each topping you put in. During my last few visits, things started to become inconsistent.  On one of the visits, the person who made my oatmeal left out one of the toppings I paid for which I didn't discover until I got all the way to work.  It was disappointing.  The amount of apples has gone from packed in at the top to a sprinkle of a few pieces...also disappointing.  On my most recent visit, there was what looked like a quarter of a teaspoon of what should have been more, especially since I paid for it.  When I asked for more it almost seemed like it was an inconvenience for the woman behind the counter to accomodate my request...poor customer service.

I went there with a friend last night. The atmosphere was as I expected; but, the food and service was not that great.\\n\\nLet's start with the service. When we arrived, it took awhile to get seated because the hostess had no sense of urgency. She was slowly putzing around. She seated the people ahead of us and then slowly walked to the stand and asked us how many we were and then I asked sit in the bar area.She warned us that the table was wet and asked if that was ok... um dry it? We went to the table. I went to the bathroom and came back to see that we at least had waters. It was then at least another 5 minutes (maybe more) before we saw the waitress again.\\n\\nWhen she finally arrived, she asked for our drink order and we said that we were ready to order everything. We ordered 3 appetizers (shrimp wrapped in bacon, wings, calamari) and one salad (strawberry fields). In a few minutes, the drinks came and then not too much longer and the shrimp, calamari and salad arrived. Ten minutes or more later, we flagged down the waitress and asked if she could bring the wings. She didn't apologize or explain why they weren't there. She simply said \\"ok i can go get them.\\" We never saw her again and had to actually go to the bar to ask for our check and then flag her down to take our card and let us settle the bill. She was definitely invisible. We were trying to get home and were there for at least a half hour longer than needed because we were waiting on her the whole time.\\n\\nNow onto the food. The salad was great (but would be  hard to mess up). We were pleasantly surprised by the candied walnuts on the salad. I think the menu just said walnuts. This salad is simple and something I could easily make at home; but, it was good. The wings were awesome; but, I already knew this would be the case. We got the wasabi-terryaki wings and weren't able t taste any wasabi; but, they were still delicious! The shrimp sounded far better on the menu than it actually was. The cajun spices were good but the bacon was way over cooked and the dipping sauce was not so great... personal preference I think. The calamari was also just ok; as, it was very greasy.

I never leave calamari behind!"},{"name":"Mission on the Bay","address":"141 Humphrey St","city":"Swampscott","stars":"3.5","text":"Rooftop view was stunning - perfect for drinks and apps (although some beverages/liquors requested were not available).

This is not a stuffy place. One thing to make note of is that the waiter will want your entire order at one time. This poses a dilemma since you do not know how large each plate will end up being. You could easily end up with too little food or too much food. You should also know that this is a restaurant for foodies: the waiter will spend time telling you about every single ingredient in every single dish. Overall, we enjoyed at least 80 to 85 percent of our choices. The scallops were tasty, the turnips were not average. The carrots were multi layered in flavor as was the cabbage. I recommend ordering grandma Lillian's potato bread, the chef's family recipe. And it comes with whipped olive oil that looks like butter, but is healthier for you. The snapper was not memorable but the goose leg was rich and flavorful. Yum!

Asking us if he had been there before. When we said we hadn't his eyes lite up and he told us all about the menu. As the owner is Turkish the food is all Turkish/Middle Eastern. We settled on a few lamb gyros on their homemade Turkish bread that he told us he makes daily in the restaurant. They were enormous sandwiches and absolutely delicious. The bread was incredible and if that is all I ate I would have been happy. The lamb was full of flavor alongside shredded lettuce, white onion, sliced tomatoes and their homemade yogurt sauce that came in a side container for self portioning.

Skinned, gutted and beheaded, and sporting several blue USDA stamps, the lean, fleshy beast tantalized students with visions of  venison victuals to come.  Chef and his assistant cut, carved and sawed through meat, bone and sinew to hew the hunk into cooking pieces.  And raw morsels--hand chopped deer tenderloin, well seasoned.  Venison tartare, indeed.  \\n\\nStudents also enjoyed quickly fried leg meat, simmered, grill-glazed ribs and venison chorizo a la minute.  Innards not to be outdone, deer kidneys made their brash appearance, quickly fried and served with Hairston Creek Farm's red pepper jelly (a lovely condiment).  My favorite preparation of the event, the venison and Richardson Farms pork kielbasa, succulently exceeded my expectations, compelling me to indulge in more than my fair share.  (And not just because I helped stuff the casings!)\\n\\nChef demonstrated several other cuts and techniques, to be served the next day at a farm site supper.

Crusty bread and house-made p√¢t√©, mustard and chutney, accompanied by Bosque Blue cheese (Veldhuizen Family Farms) and Thunder Heart Buffalo jerky rounded out the offerings.\\n\\nChef clarified meat-cutting, venison-specific as well as in general and provided plenty of instruction on dishing up your deer.

We recommend you spend your money at a better place.\\n\\nFood (6/10)\\n\\n(7/10) Sauteed shrimp with shell beans, carrot, dill and eggplant puree \\nThis item along with most of our choices were from the Chef's Tasting Menu. The jumbo shrimp was perfectly cooked and delicious. The shell beans were tasty but an odd complement because they were a bit dry. The eggplant puree was innovative and pretty good. This was a solid dish, and the portion size was acceptable for a fancy restaurant.\\n\\n(5/10) Heirloom tomato salad with braised bacon, lettuce, pepitas and horseradish aioli\\nThis salad was very small, even for a tasting menu item. We thought this might be a refreshing choice on a warm summer evening, and it would have been had there been more than a few bites. The bacon was very salty, and there was hardly enough lettuce. The pine nuts added a nice touch but it was difficult to get those in the same bite as the tomato.\\n\\n(5/10) Sauteed snapper with snap peas, bok choy, fennel salad, hazelnuts & 5 spice broth\\nWe were looking forward to this sampling but it was another letdown. The broth was tasteless, as was the snapper and the vegetables accompanying it. The vegetables did taste fresh, and the sweetness of the hazelnuts did bring an interesting flavor to the mix. The bok choy tasted too salty.\\n\\n(8/10) Grilled ribeye with warm German potato salad, mushroom puree and scallions\\nFinally a winner! The ribeye was tender and succulent, but a little too salty for our palates. The warm potato salad was delicious but also too salty. The mushroom puree and scallions went very well with this dish. We would be happy with the ribeye and the mushroom puree as our entire meal!\\n\\n(6/10) Spring risotto with English peas, asparagus, dandelion greens and radish\\nWe chose this one from the Farmer's Tasting Menu. This dish had the largest portions so order this if you want bang for your buck. However, there was a disconnect between the wonderful menu descriptions and the flavor of the food. The risotto was pleasant, but nothing about it stood out. The dandelion greens and vegetables were bland. Also - the dish didn't even look appetizing with those large, thin round pieces of radish scattered on top.\\n\\n(4/10) Grilled walu with swiss chard, quinoa, radish salad and maroon carrot puree\\nWe wanted to be adventurous and order something we haven't heard of. Apparently walu is similar to escolar - so we weren't that brave after all. In what seemed to be the common denominator between most of the dishes - the walu was so salty that it was inedible. It was also overcooked. We were already dehydrated from eating too many salty dishes and sent this one back. Our new walu was completely tasteless. Sadly, over-salted or bland seem to be the choices. The swiss chard was decent, the carrot puree was delightful and there was a hint of earthiness in the quinoa which made it very enjoyable.\\n\\n(7/10) Flourless chocolate cake and toasted nut florentine, orange curd & raspberry sauce\\nWe usually like flourless chocolate cakes and this one was no exception. The first thing we noticed when our plate came out is it was unbelievably small. Perhaps since it was on the tasting menu...it was more of a flourless chocolate brownie bite! Nonetheless, we enjoyed the rich, dense chocolaty flavor. The toasted nut florentine on top was very crunchy but savory. The orange curd and raspberry essence complemented this cake beautifully. Because one or two bite is just a tease, order a full size portion of this dessert!\\n\\nService (6/10)\\n\\nWe dined on a quiet Sunday evening. There were only a few other patrons. We made reservations and were seated promptly. We had several waitstaff, which we didn't mind at all. But what irked us is that each one seemed inattentive or scatterbrained. The waiters seemed very focused on bringing our dishes out, but didn't really explain what we were eating or ask if we needed anything. We also felt a bit rushed during our experience here. The one nice thing is when we told our waiter that the walu was too salty - they took it back and brought out another one...but it took 25 minutes. Zoot is lacking in warmth and a personal touch. For instance, even though it was sweet that the menu stated Happy Birthday, nobody actually said it, and they looked inconvenienced when we asked them to take a picture of our table.

The North Market is smaller than the West Side Market in Cleveland, but its merchants are every bit as passionate and their products are crafted in quality.\\n\\nUpon entering the market, I insisted that we go straight to CaJohn's Flavor & Fire, which is a small stand that sells sauces and salsas.  Seeing this stand on Food Network, I knew that they supposedly sell some of the hottest sauce in America, if not the world.  \\n\\nSo I asked the clerk what their hottest sauce was.  I was surprised when she didn't say the Jolokia sauce.  Instead, she grabbed a small bottle of Smokin Ed's Carolina Reaper Hot Sauce, which you can buy online.  She opened the lid, I grabbed four pretzel rods, dipped them in the sauce (I got a tiny amount on each pretzel rod), and handed them to my dad, brother-in-law, nephew, and I kept one for me.  There was some initial resistance among the men as they questioned what they were about to do.  But within a minute, all four of us chewed up the heat infused pretzel rod.  Then, within five seconds, we began looking at each other for reactions.  This was entertaining.  Not much was being said at this point as we were still chewing.  After 10 seconds, the ingesting was over and the pain, I mean, heat, began to set in.  After 20 seconds, my mouth was enfuego.  After 30 seconds, I was looking for a glass of milk.  The nearby bread stand had bread samples, which I quickly ate three of, but it didn't really take the burn away.  I ended up suffering it out until about 5 minutes later when the heat had subsided.  The other guys handled it fairly well, but my brother-in-law was officially sweating.  And later he mentioned that his stomach felt like it was on fire.  He bought a bottle to take home.  We only tasted a drop, keep in mind.  If you like hot sauce, this stuff will definitely give you what you want and then some!  I could not imagine eating a chicken wing smothered in this stuff!\\n\\nThen we stopped for some ice cream at Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams.

I'd tell you more but my children didn't let me get more than a bite. They're a serious cut above that Dunkin out in the parking lot.

They even have lengua, which works better in some tacos. Make sure to get your burrito with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and all your favorite toppings.

If you are feeling particularly hungry and don't mind a few extra calories, go ahead and try the quesadilla. It is not your regular quesadilla, it is essentially a burrito wrapped in a quesadilla.

I gave it two stars because at least the service was good. We had the upstairs area with bar and dining room. We had preselected meals and a open bar. There was about 25 of us. The appetizers were not bad. We had to choose between the Stark tips or Irish Parmesan chicken, both cane with broccoli and mash. Instead of broccoli they gave us green beans, no one complained. You would think that with such a big crowd there would be more effort placed on detail. The chicken was burned and slightly rough, as if it was uncooked or reheated. The mash was fine and I did not try the beans, a coworker said they were cold.

For $10, I think it should come with a little more than 4 small bites of meat in proportion with the rest of the huge bowl for a meal that is simple to make with inexpensive ingredients."},{"name":"Sckavone's","address":"4100 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Loved their scones that they had as an appetizer!!

I'm told that this is part of the training ((and from the review below mine, you can see why others will agree)). Every waiter and every bartender has worked the kitchen, learning how to prepare EVERY item on the menu. They know what's in every dish, so if you ask, they can tell you. It's not some secret that only the chefs know -- thank goodness. The chefs have worked the tables, the door... everyone in this restaurant knows what it's like to be in everyone else's position - so it's a very cohesive environment. \\n\\nNow, after the semantics, let's talk brass tacks. The ambiance and decor is relaxing. It's like a laid-back type of up-scale. If the restaurant were a person, it would be that girl next door who is totally cool, one of the guys, but can still dress up and look fantastic. You know, so - she's a girl and you don't want to do gross things, like wear your cut-off-jean-shorts that you use for mowing the lawn... but it's cool to wear a nice pair of jeans. \\n\\nMy favorite thing on the menu, by far, and one of the biggest reasons that I patron this particular restaurant is for their Black Bean and Rice Burger. As a girl who does not eat beef, it's nearly impossible to find a burger that one can eat. This, however, is the ceme de la creme! I'm also a huge fan of their Sashimi Tuna Salad. \\nMy husbands fav is the ribs. As he describes them (in great finger-licking moan-inducing detail): they fall right off the bone and melt in your mouth; ribs you can eat with just a fork. \\nI'm not sure how I feel about that but c'est la vie. What can I do? Still -- a fantastic restaurant. And your wallet will feel it -- but the service, attention, and food are so good you won't even notice.

From casual to fine dining, from the US to Europe to Asia, never have I had a hostess tell me that I had to leave at a specific time because the specific table I'm being seat at, is reserved for later. I've been in packed restaurants that have half as many tables and deal with reservations better. After being seated, I see half a dozen empty tables, some weren't filled even when we left. That shows how inept they are at managing their tables. Empty tables and I'm still give a time limit for dinner (oh yea, their kitchen was also behind as told by our server).\\n\\nThe menu is meh at best. Entree pastas and their meats are ordered separately. This can be quite nice if people want to mix and match, except they charge each at prices other restaurant consider a full entree... The portion size... half an entree. What did you expect? So for a plate that would cost $20-30 somewhere else and would be so large I wouldn't be able to finish it, I now have to spend $30-40 for a plated/dish that was barely enough to fill me. Good thing there was bread and butter to fill me up. \\n\\nOk ok, it's classier Italian. I get it. Fine, I'll pay the higher price and deal with the unusual menu design. For what I'm being charged, I expect good food, something that deserves the $30. I ordered the malfalde and gf had the linguni vongole. What came out was something that was overly heavy on pesto and too salty. Gf's dish also had heavy pesto flavors, even though she had something totally different. Also, the clams were quite fishy, more so than normal. The other dishes at the table was fine, I think. Didn't ask how bad their's were. \\n\\nDecor was pretty good. I like the design, the bar and the layout. My only complaint here was that it was way too dim. I could read the menu, but the older folks with us could not see anything. Even with the late afternoon light coming in through the high windows in the back, there wasn't enough to read. Ridiculous when we have to pull out our phones and use the flashlight on it to light up the menu. Sigh... stupid stupid.\\n\\nOverall, dinner there was overpriced, underwhelmed and highly disappointing.

They seat us at a table with 3 on one side, 2 on the other, and yours truly at the head of the table sticking out into the main aisle.  \\n\\nRealizing this violation of restaurant feng shui, they move us to another table with a more reasonable 3 and 3 arrangement.  Eventually the waitress shows up.  She's missing a tooth, and is complaining that she hasn't gotten a smoke break in over an hour.  Lovely.\\n\\nShe takes our beverage order, shows up with half of 'em, mixes up one, forgets another.  Having corrected those, she takes our order and surprisingly seems to get everything right.

Also - if you pay $11.95 for a sandwich, be a sport -- serve it with fries.   No, no ... Joan & Ed assume you just want (soggy) cole slaw and a limp, impotent pickle.  \\n\\nAnd, we thought about ordering dessert, but our Marlboro gal had already dropped the check.  So finally, when she noticed we hadn't paid, and were talking about cakes and such, asked if she could get us anything else.   She told us there was a really, delicious dessert special -- but couldn't tell us what it was!  Not even was it \\"chocolate\\" or \\"fruit\\" or anything.  Nor did she say \\"let me go check...\\"  All she said was \\"you should get it, it looks great.\\"  Seriously ??!?!\\n\\nWhen she brought back the desserts we did order (and could identify), there were only three.

I'm actually surprised it hasn't formed a permanent indent in the shape of my buttocks.  This place truly has become like Cheers to me.  The TV Cheers, not the cheesy tourist trap in Boston.  There's usually a crowd of regulars at the bar and despite what your mother may have told you, it's ok to talk to strangers here.  I've met quite a few characters during my evenings here, which is one of the things that keeps bringing me back.\\n\\nI spend most of my visits here eating at the bar, but on occasion I do venture into the dining room.  Lately they've been running a twin lobster special for about 14 bucks which I've taken advantage of several times.  I intend to get my fill of lobster before the economy recovers and drives prices back up.  :-)  I'm a big fan of the New York sirloin as well.  All the entrees run you under $20 except for the fillet mignon dishes which I believe are about $25.\\n\\nThe real value, I must say is the bar menu.  There's standard bar offerings like burgers and chicken sandwiches, all of which are delicious, but I like to pick from the small chalkboard menu posted behind the bar.  There's usually some interesting specials like stuffed cabbage, stuffed chicken, and I even had monkfish once.  The prices are just right, too as all of those dishes were under 10  bucks.  Of course, I'd never suggest it to the staff, but they really could raise their prices on some of these items and still be competitive.  Speaking of which, drinks are generous and on the inexpensive side (which, clearly, is another reason I keep coming back!)  They pour a hefty martini which often includes some bonus beverage in the dirty rocks if you ask for them.  \\n\\nThe Willowtree has an eclectic charm about it that I have come to love.

This was a special event dinner with a specially crafted menu with drink pairings. In short: Amazing. The brand new Executive Chef (he'd only been there for two weeks as of that night) Don Cherry, originally of Gunshow, knocked the menu out of the park. It was beautiful, flavorful, and flowed with nothing seeming out of place. The Beverage Director, Mani Gonzalez, hand picked each course's pairing. It was a remarkable tour of how well food and wine can work together. Fun fact, she does have her own line of crafted bitters, Ms. Gonzalez is definitely legit. The General Manager JC Shurts was a gracious host who acknowledged the previous shortcomings and was excited to have this be the dawn of a new and better era for City Winery. Afterward, while conversing with JC, he led us to the speakeasy for a round of incredible bourbon. \\nLook beyond the old ratings and give this place a try. The atmosphere is incredible, there is a ton of parking available, the performances are spot on (The Indigo Girls did two performances that night) and the food is to die for. This is a professional establishment with a team that wants to work together to create something amazing. There is no denying that it is a pricey venue, but considering the location and ambiance you expect that and the food is worth it. \\nI am excited to see if Chef Cherry announces a Valentine's Day menu.

I struggled figuring out what to get because their menu is just in Spanish and they don't advertise a lot of what they have.

I got 2 bean and cheese papusas, a tamale like thing made of just corn, and a sweet empanada, and a horchata. All of that for around $10! \\nI was not a fan of the corn tamale, which googling revealed it to be a Tamale de Elote. It was dense, bland, and dry. It seems like they are supposed to be like that so I guess I just don't like it. \\n\\nThe dessert empanada was good, but, again, I might like it more if I knew what it was. The empanada \\"dough\\" was actually made of plantains, which was really good. No idea what the filing was- white, thick, sweetish. Maybe I need to do some more googling. \\n\\nI would definitely go back for the papusas. The bean and cheese ones were so good as they were freshly fried up on the cook top. So the exterior had a bit of a crunch which gave way to a soft cheesy interior. This to-go order was served with a little baggy filled with hot sauce and a pickled, spicy slaw. The combination of everything went well together with a hot cheesy filling, cool tangy slaw, and spicy sauce."},{"name":"Capo Restaurant","address":"443 West Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My friends and I ate at Capo last Saturday and had the best experience.

One roll is topped with 2 or 3 kinds of sources, and it is so sour, salty and sweet that make me feel I am drinking these creamy sauces, and, not surprisingly, I can not taste any flavor of the fish. The second roll contains smoked salmon, tuna and shrimp tempera. To be honest, it is quite hard to make this combination tastes like X. However, they put a decent amount of vinegar in the plate, so that each piece of sushi is dipped with a lot of vinegar. When I eat it, the flavor of vinegar domained my mouth. The sour completely covers other tastes, and it simply makes want to spit. The third roll seems like to be the only normal one. It is topped with fried crab, and there is a shrimp tempera inside. However, I don't know what kind of source they used, but the roll tastes like eating a chip, which is dipped with honey, while brushing the teeth. I firmly believe that these rolls are not Japanese food at all.

Hawkers did not disappoint!  The interior reminded us strongly of Chipotle's interior, with lots of corrugated iron.Our waitress was very friendly, making a beer suggestion to my husband (they offer 90 different beers by the bottle, mostly ranging in price from $4 to $7) and giving us ample time to look over the menu.  We decided to each select a dish to share, then each have one dish for ourselves, since I do not eat meat, and my husband had decided in advance to try the roast duck banh mi sliders.\\n\\nOur first dish was the Asian fried green beans, lightly battered and tossed in five spice seasoning for $4.50. This was delicious!  We ate them in about 30 seconds flat.  The beans were a bit oily, but in a good, street-food type of way, and the five spice seasoning lent an exotic flavor to the beans.\\n\\nNext came the South Asia shrimp curry for $6.50.  We really, really liked this dish.  The coconut milk was a nice touch, and the shrimp were large and very flavorful.  We ordered a side of white rice for $1 to eat the curry over, and I was somewhat challenged to eat this with chopsticks, but I managed.\\n\\nIn addition to the white rice, I had also ordered a piece of roti canai, thinking that I would sop up the shrimp curry with this. The roti was outstanding, buttery and flaky, and I could have eaten seven more of these!  The menu mentioned that it would be served with the \\"signature spicy curry dipping sauce,\\" so I was astounded to find that this dipping sauce had chunks of chicken in it!  I didn't eat the chicken chunks, but, since I don't eat meat, I would have asked them to hold the dipping sauce if I'd realized what it contained.  My only complaint about the restaurant is that I wish they had marked the menu to identify vegetarian dishes, which would have made it a lot easier to navigate.  Currently, the menu has symbols for spicy dishes and for \\"Hawkers Signature Dishes,\\" a symbol that I always find to be singularly useless.  Why tell me what your signature dish is?  What does that even mean, in practical terms?  Why not have a special section called \\"Hawkers Signature Dishes,\\" instead of \\"Hawkers Originals?\\"  The inclusion of both, without identifications that might have actually helped diners order, is a pet peeve of mine, not just on Hawkers' menu, but on menus at other restaurants, as well.\\n\\nMy next dish was the $6 Hawkers fish tacos, one of the Hawkers Originals, and it was the weakest of all the dishes we tried.  The five spice fish inside the tacos were woefully under-salted, and the shredded cabbage was dried up and didn't seem to be fresh.\\n\\nMy husband's next dish was also a Hawkers Original selection, the aforementioned Banh Mi sliders with roast duck for $6. He thought they were a touch heavy on the bread, but that was to be expected with a thick baguette. The duck was flavorful, though not very tender, and he liked the light mayonnaise dressing, without which he felt the duck would have been a bit dry.  The cucumbers in this dish were reportedly \\"great,\\" and complemented the duck nicely.  The bread was not chewy, and tasted fresh.\\n\\nThe total for roti, curry, green beans, tacos, rice, banh mi sliders, a Coke, and a Southern Tier IPA was $36.22 after tax and before tip.  We left the restaurant STUFFED, and definitely felt that we could have ordered probably one fewer dish than we did, though we had wanted to try multiple items.\\n\\nIf you're interested in photos, I've got them uploaded on our dining blog, http://hpandaw.wordpress.com\\n\\nCheers!\\nHeather W"},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Food was great!!

Firstly, I was unable to book a cruise for the time slot I wanted. According to the representative on the phone, they could supposedly only 'squeeze me in' the last (really?) remaining spot. Come on... it didn't seem like a full ship - quite the contrary... Second: there was a general lack of organization at the boarding area. Although I had printed out my ticket online, I was informed there (simply because I asked, otherwise I may never have known this until it was time to board) that my ticket was invalid because their scanner is broken (...). Multiple lines formed at the boarding area because there was no supervision. Anyway, I could have ignored all the above (because I was sincerely predisposed to having a great time and was really looking forward to this event), if a soft drink I had with me inside my bag had not been confiscated by a particularly rude crew member (whose name I will likely forward to his supervisors); the same person was also rude to me as we were waiting to disembark at the end of the cruise. Hey buddy, this is a CRUISE ship, which we paid MONEY to enjoy, not the sixth fleet where we should expect to be ordered around! So basically, it's not enough that we pay their overpriced ticket, but we are practically forced to pay additionally for their overpriced drinks on board, unless we want to get completely dehydrated on a hot summer day like this. I should have realized this is their money-grubbing culture, when I was asked over the phone as I was making my reservation, if I wanted to include add-ons for drinks, food, etc. Come on, don't be so greedy!

Most of the dishes here don't have any particularly interesting flavors, but they are all spicier than what you'd expect.  I suppose without meat, they lack the certain flavor aspect that Americans crave from meat.  Not too much of a fan for spicy, cold food.

One of a very few French eateries in the city.  Quite a large space reminiscent of FAB it's got the same high ceilings and lively crowd amid plenty of French fare. Some outdoor seating available (and if you want to hear your dining companions this may be a better option). Lively after work bar scene as well. If you're into that sort of thing. I am not but hey, that's just me. I know some of you need a stiff one after a 9-5 grind.\\n\\nFriendly attentive staff (I never know if they are extra friendly because I am taking photos and notes but I appreciate it nonetheless) and plenty of staff. Just what I like to see. My water glass will never want for water and my wine will flow freely.  Really does anyone like a server spread too thin? This is a service industry after all.\\n\\nIt's restaurant week and we ordered from both menus.  I have to say this regular menu at Niko reads like poetry for a foodie that is completely enamoured of French cuisine.  All the greats are there and then some. This more than a bistro, it's full on French food. \\n\\nFirst up is some salmon croque monsieur. This is incredibly rich. Salmon rich, cheese rich and fried in butter rich. Plan to share it and have some high acid wine with it. Good stuff but a little goes a long way. \\n\\nCoq au vin. Two juice fat hind quarters of a chicken. Wow. This one left me a little speechless. I haven't had a coq au vin quite this good. Dark, deeply flavored and tender as you want it.  Impeccable presentation and a flavor that is far better than I expected.  Full on 10 out of 10. \\n\\nBeef bourguignon. Luscious braised beef cheeks that came out steaming hot, full dense rich demi sauce that could be inhaled 2 feet away. I am not positive but I suspect the noodles are house made. Delicate and ideal texture for the dish. The sauce  perfectly portioned so not sloppy or overly wet. The cheeks literally melt in the mouth. More tender than a short rib and the flavor was another speechless inducing moment if not several. I absolutely would have ordered it again if I had room to eat more.\\n\\nBaba au rhum is ok. It's very light but a bit bland. Delicious vanilla pastry cream in the center, tangy citrusy sauce (I was getting peach and kumquat but I can't confirm) . I didn't finish it. The cr√®me  brulee is excellent. Heavy cream base, good healthy vanilla flavor. That did get finished. \\n\\nNice wines, atmosphere, food and service.

I went here on Tuesday night, excited that I found a spot so new that it only had four Yelp reviews.   \\n\\nAmbiance-wise, I agree with the others who said it's dimly lit and classy.  It's \\"slick\\" classy rather than \\"plush\\" classy - leather barstools, finished hardwood floors, and lots of mirrors, as opposed to upholstered seats and carpeted floors.  Dress-wise, I would not feel underdressed in jeans, as long as I paired them with heels rather than sneakers, while at the same time, I might feel overdressed (a/k/a over-exposed) in a dress that wasn't office-appropriate.  \\n\\nAs far as the drinks go, they have a great list of creative cocktails, but if you order something off-menu, you'll get exactly what you want.  I started with one of their drinks, the Paper Plane, and then switched over to my tried-and-true favorite, a Godfather.  Hawthorne has a great selection of quality booze, including many less common cordials (really?  I thought I was the only person who kept a bottle of Cardamaro front and center!).  If you're not into craft cocktails, this may not be the place for you, although I'm sure they could shake up something you'd grow to love.  \\n\\nJust a heads up, this is a cocktail lounge, not a restaurant - there is a kitchen, but their food offerings are pretty limited.  Don't come here for dinner, come here after dinner to imbibe and nibble.  \\n\\nThis place gets bonus points for having attentive, personable bartenders and for playing jazz at perfect drinking volume - loud enough to hear, soft enough to have a conversation without a) losing your voice or b) getting so tired of saying \\"What?\\" that you nod your head to everything and unknowingly consent to wearing a puffy shirt. \\n\\nI'll be back!"},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for my friends 20th birthday, she had made a reservation a month before the dinner and when we got there they said they didn't have one for that name.

Our server seemed a bit stuck up, she gave an attitude whenever we asked a question and rolled her eyes occasionally. I think it was because we are still fairly young, but I don't think that gives her the right to treat us that way. Anyways, I don't eat most meats so the food wasn't very appetizing to me. I ordered the smoked salmon with the goat cheese appetizer and it was very delicious. One of my friends ordered as well and didn't like it. The manager actually came out and took it off her check and gave her french fries (which were sooo delicious!). The manager was super nice and made sure we had a great experience.

However, everything else was fine and if I ate at the restaurant then I may have been satisfied. My main complaint is the quality of the delivery service. For starters you're forced to purchase around $20 worth of food in order to have food delivered, depending on whether you're buying through grub hub or the store website and are paying a higher delivery charge. Ultimately, after the delivery charge and tip you're paying around $30 for a meal. This is less than ideal for someone that is buying food for one. Moreover, the person that delivered the food wants to meet you in the lobby. As far as I know there is nothing preventing them from coming to the door of your room, no key requirements for the elevator for example. And this somewhat defeats the purpose of ordering food and certainly brings into question what the delivery charge actually buys you. \\n\\nIn sum, i definitely would not order food to be delivered, unless i was ordering for more than one person, but may go to the restaurant for a meal."},{"name":"Asian Chao","address":"Hartsfield/Jackson International Airport","city":"Atlanta","stars":"1.5","text":"Gross.

I ordered the seared tuna appetizer, and was really prepped for a few nice pieces of tuna on yummy Asian slaw - after all, that's what the menu promised. Don't waste your time or money on it. It was completely unrecognizable as seared tuna. In fact I even pulled up a picture of seared tuna on my phone just to make sure I was clear about what I THOUGHT it should look like.  Honestly the meat looked like chicken, it was that light. When I called the server over and asked her if it was tuna and I showed her the picture she said it was because this was almond crusted. I decided to pass on it and eventually the server offered to bring me another appetizer. I asked for the ale battered chicken tenders and was brought three teeny tiny, about the size of my thumb tenders. They were tasty but come on folks - 3 itsy bitsy pieces?!

I had picked up tanning during my last semester at UCF and wanted to continue after I moved out of the UCF area. AISHA is a few minutes away from my apartment, so it seemed like the perfect choice. \\n\\nThe first visit went okay. The receptionist was nice and gave me a tour of the salon, even though I told her I was only interested in tanning. And that's when it kind of fell downhill for my duration of my \\"membership.\\" \\n\\nLet's start with the tanning rooms. The beds are way out of date, poorly maintained, and my kitten can sneeze harder than the fans can blow. There's carpet in the rooms, which I personally think is gross when people are sweating, spilling lotion, etc. You can tell this aspect of the salon was a last minute idea to get some extra cash.\\n\\nI (stupidly) signed up for an \\"unlimited\\" membership for tanning. Here's why this is in quotes: I only paid for the first month and I wasn't asked for another payment until last month (that's about 6 months worth of tanning for free). It was great for me, but I'm a little concerned about how the business is running. Even their method of record keeping is prehistoric. They used sign off cards that are organized by first name in a box, and then have you sign your initials for each session. I'm assuming the only reason why I didn't pay for any additional months was a lack of communication between the other associates as well as to me (I was never told when the membership would end or asked to make any payments before a session). If I had known my membership ended earlier, I would have definitely found a new place sooner. \\n\\nOne time, I went there probably 30 minutes before they closed (I was working late and tanning gives me a little pick me up after a long day, shoot me). While I was tanning (naked), I heard the door to the room open and thought it was my imagination. To my shock, the door was wide open! After quickly getting dressed and walking out, the lights were turned off, front doors were locked, and the receptionist was the only person left. I was done 5 minutes before the salon was suppose to close! The whole event just left a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nI can't really say much about the rest of the salon since I never used any of their other services, but if it compares to how they treat people that want to tan, then I definitely don't recommend going there. I saw that they got new owners/management/whatever, but unless they do a complete gut job of their tanning section, I suggest just avoiding it and go to a salon that is tanning only."},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Thank god for this old building and all the incredible memories, and meals, made here over the years.

When you go to a tavern, you expect quintessential pub/tavern food. The menu consists of 10 apps, 4 salads, 6 burgers, 8 entrees and 6 pizzas. I do not understand the pizza component of the menu. Why not a couple of additional sandwiches and a couple of more entrees. Why not a Sheppard's pie, a meatloaf, a open faced turkey sandwich? Just an idea.\\n\\nGot the gorgonzola burger. The burger itself was lacking seasoning. The bun the burger was served on was firm and flavorless. The gorgonzola cheese had little to no flavor which was stunning to me. \\n\\nThe hostess seemed to be overcompensating for the poor reviews on Yelp by checking on the tables in inordinate number of times during my dining experience. \\n\\nOverall a very poor dining experience. I know that new restaurants have growing pains, but unless I start to hear some better reviews about Black Horse Tavern, I am not sure if I will ever give them a second chance."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Even if the food was bad (which it isn't, in fact, far from it) I would go here again and again.

I guess I focus more on costumes and shiny gold pants than slacks and nice shirts.\\n\\nIn the midst of shopping, she was smart enough to suggest a break for wine and a little something to eat. Apothecary sounded like it'd hit the mark. And it did, if only half-way.\\n\\nThe decor of the place is pretty nifty. I especially like the paintings in the men's room, although it's a little unsettling to have Sam Kinison staring at you while you pee. \\n\\nOur waiter was helpful and recommended a rich Bonarda for her and a really pleasant Chardonnay for me. I don't usually like Chards, but this one hit the spot. \\n\\nThe only real disappointment was the food. The menu doesn't lend itself well to gnoshing, unless you want to split a panini, which we didn't. When asked about the $13 cheese plate, we were told it had brie, gorgonzola and manchego. Ok. Nothing special there, and no mention of any accoutrements to make it fabulous, so we passed.\\n\\nI though maybe the $7 hummus plate would be interesting, but she informed me that it's a rather small bit of hummus for $7 and the promised olives were more of a garnish than part of the dish. \\n\\nOk, what about Bruschetta? Well, she'd already tried it and said it just tasted like garlic and balsamic. \\n\\nCriminy! Is that how you spell criminy? I reckon spell check doesn't recognize it. \\nBut really, we were at a loss. She knows my foodie-ness, and we were left with few choices.\\n\\nSo, Caprese salad it is! Something light and simple but fulfilling? \\nWell, no. Not really. \\nSee, usually the pieces of mozzarella on a caprese salad are about as big as the slices of tomato. These were not. In fact, they were not even close. Instead, there were tiny little bits of cheese smattered over some rather tough, unripe tomatoes (which I can't really fault them for, given the wintertime, but still). Then as the menu said it was \\"served over basil\\", I assumed there would be at least a few leaves of basil layering the bottom of the plate. There must be a basil shortage someplace, because it looked like they took about one leaf of basil and tore it up over the salad (more as a garnish than a part of the salad). \\n\\nLastly, the flavor of the overall dish was disappointing. The balsamic they drizzled over the dish overpowered everything. Plus, I'm used to caprese salads having a little sprinkling of salt and pepper to balance out the ridiculously salt absorbing properties of fresh mozz and tomatoes. This came plain, which would have been okay if the rest of the dish was well-made, but it wasn't.\\n\\nSo, I'll have to give it another shot sometime. See if I'm missing something here. I like their wines, and it's helpful to have the 20% off for take out wine. I really want to try their Tocai.

The main reason being that most of my visits involved coming here after the ingestion of mass amounts of ethyl alcohol. Well, I can proudly say that my last visit was a sober one...at least, it started out that way.\\n\\nTelevisions adorn every corner of this great little pub, making it a great destination to watch various sporting events of your choice. I've come in the past to watch football (the European variety...probably better known to you as soccer). This visit was for Monday night football. Cowgirls vs Redskins. I won't get into the details about he game...I'm sure it's common knowledge.\\n\\nWe were able to procure a large table in the back room, directly under the glow of the projection screen. Along with the screen and a number of televisions, one is ensured a view of the game, no matter which way you are facing. This makes it possible to face the person across from you, who may or may not be engaging you in conversation, thus allowing you to make occasional eye contact to give the impression that you are actually paying attention to what they are saying when in reality, your gaze is past their ear, directed at the game. Now guys...this still takes skill. Mr Tramps is the place to practice that skill.\\n\\nMonday night is $5 pitcher night. That would be $5 pitchers of mixed drinks. Now, they are actually half pitchers and are not heavy pours, but for $5, it's still a decent deal. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food is good. The queso is spicy and rich. The calamari perfectly fried...not greasy and still tender. A fellow sports enthusiast and I decided to try a pizza. We agreed on the Vagabond. Leeks, bacon, goat cheese, and pesto...sounds like a winner! The pizza had great flavor and was enough to satisfy the both of us. The only shortcoming for me was the crust. It was almost cracker like. Nothing wrong with that type of crust, I just prefer a slightly chewier crust...but like I said...it was still a damn good pizza.\\n\\nThere were a number of other intriguing items on the menu in addition to a great beer selection.

It almost pains me how generous I've been with my ratings as this restaurant has exceeded in all manners of my expectations and boy, were my expectations high. For those who enjoy fine dining and aren't afraid to dish out some extra money for an extravagant dining experience, I urge you to look no where else but Canoe. \\n\\nLet's talk details. I reserved a seat for my anniversary with my boyfriend and upon entering this establishment; you're encompassed in this rustic, warm, atmosphere, dimly lit and no cheesy themed music playing in the background; just the dull cacophony of the diners chatter and the clanging of pots and pans from an open kitchen. A simple, yet elegant combination of wood, brick and a glass wall that overlooks the river make this an ideal destination for romantic meals. The servers, all knew my name and why we were dining with them that night. I was greeted with \\"Hello Ms. Liu\\" and \\"Happy Anniversary!\\" The hostess, servers, and even chef that plated our dessert plate were informed that it was our first anniversary. As unnerving as this seemed at first, it in hindsight was \\nincredibly professional and a great way to making us feel more than welcome. \\n\\nOur waiter was not only professional, but informed and enthused about all things Canoe. He had recommendations and seemed to know just as much about food as the chefs did. Excited and eager to inform and delight, he kept the perfect distance between professionalism and over-zealousness. His fervor for food seemed to infect us because soon I was bouncing in my chair. \\n\\nIn terms of food, it was a carefully crafted culinary experience that rocked me to my core. In total I tried three items of food the Smoked Salmon Starter, Carolina Braised Rabbit, and a trio of Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e. The Smoked Salmon starter was an excellent combination of a raw salmon smoked, with a clean sour cream mixed with capers that had been drained of all brine flavor mixed with fennel. The Carolina Braised Rabbit was my first experience eating rabbit and perhaps as a virgin I will know nothing of how it should taste but the sauce was sweet with a garlic undertone, the rabbit lean but still impeccably tender with a consistency of braised duck, topped on a bed of julienned carrots. The bacon ravioli served with it is only accurately described by my waiter in two words, \\"Don't share.\\" The Trio Cr√®me br√ªl√©e was three separate bowls of different flavors: pistachio, amaretto, and I believe hazelnut but I could be wrong. The texture of the cr√®me br√ªl√©e was perfect, as a custard should be thick and mousse-like, not heavy and gloopy like some cr√®me br√ªl√©e's I've experienced; light with a subtle change in flavors that didn't overpower the sweetness of the custard. \\n\\nI read over some of the reviews and while I note there have been some bad experiences I implore you to try here, just once. If you have a bad experience so be it but I hope, man do I hope yours is like mine: a culinary experience, an ambience unlike any other I've experienced.

(I know, I know, report me to the Pork Council and the bacon-lovers brigade.) Less would have been so much more! I did have a solution - the side of cole slaw did a great job - if you're wondering why people put it on sandwiches, this is the answer. Choose your sides wisely.

Maybe because it's not good? \\n\\nAfter camping on the OR Coast, my boyfriend and I wanted to stop off in Portland to have lunch and a few pints at Widmer. Alas, they were closed for Memorial Day. Lame, I know. So we checked on Yelp to find what other Breweries were near by with good food and beer. My boyfriend is a big fan of Deschutes, so we decided to check it out. \\n\\nI was really surprised to find a wait at 2 pm on a Monday, even if it is a Holiday. It is a big open building with a combo Lodge/Loft feeling. Leave it to Portland, I guess. Overall though, we were super impressed with the building, and the ambiance. \\n\\nThey also have a huge beer selection, and they tell you what beers are Brewed there on-site, and which are brewed in Bend, OR. I went with the Twilight Ale, and it was good, but nothing to write home about. I could definitely drink it again though, and would be more than willing to try other beers by Deschutes, given the ambiance, it would be a nice way to unwind and enjoy a beer during HH after a day of shopping, working, etc. \\n\\nThe food though, was overpriced and too ambitious. I understand, its the 21st Century, and this is Portland. Obviously the food is going to be all about organic, high quality, gluten-free,vegan, free-range, blah blah blah. All of that means a higher price tag. Ok, I get it. But with all that high-quality blah blah blah and $12 for a burger and sweet potato fries. You would think it would be good, right? Sorry, but no, it's not. First off, the Sweet Potato Fries were easily some of the worst I have ever had. They were lacking in any flavor, and weren't even cooked all the way(which is weird, considering how long it took us to get our food). And the burger. Don't even get me started on the burger. One of my biggest pet peeve with all the fancy schmancy burgers popping up all over is consistency. You spend all this money on a good quality meat, only for it to be over-cooked(coming from someone who actually likes their meat medium-well) and under-seasoned. And to top it off, they use a fancy, freshly baked, local bun and don't even bother to toast it. What is the point of having all sorts of expensive, local ingredients to be so lazy as to overlook something as simple as not serving a cold bun? I would expect something like that out of McDonalds, but I am pretty sure even they don't serve their burgers on a cold bun. It is lazy, and disgusting. This place has the potential to be good, but it seems like they put too much emphasis on using the right ingredients, over serving those ingredients well.\\n\\nPS Do not eat the elk burger if you are going to be in a car for 3 hours.

So we said \\"what the heck\\" and gave this place a shot knowing that Minado charges about $30+ a person and this place was going to be similar in cost. \\n\\nAs many of the reviewers had said, this place was a bit small, but bigger than GinGa a few blocks away. The atmosphere was cozy but also lively enough to be considered very good. I also thought that the service was fine, so no complaints there. Besides, any food connoisseur would agree that if the food is great, service doesn't matter that much assuming you are not stress for time. So that was it on the good side. \\n\\nHere comes the bad. We had six people in our group and we ordered a number of Japanese tapas dishes in the upwards of #13+ plus a few rolls. ALL the dishes we ordered were very good to fantastic in quality and flavour, BUT they were so tiny in quantity that my stomach was still growling after all those dishes. I'm not a particularly big eater but could eat if duty calls. In addition, I wasn't the only one and pretty confident that we ordered a lot since the bill totaled $35+ per person and we ordered maybe 2 beer bottles. So I know it was all food and not alcohol. It got so bad that my friend and I were still hungry enough to stop at the nearby Friendly's Express for some good old American fry food to fill the hole left in my stomach and wallet. (Maybe Friendly's knew they can go after the hungry-Shiki crowd when they opened.)\\n\\nNow I very rarely complain about restaurants if the food was good, but then I started pondering that a good meal should contain at least three of the following components to be considered worthwhile. They were food quality/flavour, price, and was I full or not? I can deal with bad food that makes me full. I can also deal with good food that cost a lot. But the one thing I CANNOT deal with is pricey food that doesn't make me full because that defeats the entire purpose of eating. Thus at the end of the day, I still needed food which meant more holes in my wallet than a AK-47 thru a target practice at the shooting range. When it all came down to it, I expected to be full when I eat out, especially after doling out $35+ per person. I mean I gotta be full even if the food tasted like shit cause at least I can say I'm full of shit!\\n\\nBut anyways, I felt bad giving this place a 2 star because based on food quality/flavour alone, it should be at least 4 stars. However, it dropped two stars due to first it was quite pricey and second it didn't make me full. I cannot recommend a restaurant that doesn't make its patrons full while putting holes in their wallet. I rather go to Minado and stuff myself with \\"okay\\" sushi and pay $30+ than go here. Even GinGa is a better option and at cheaper prices. \\n\\nI understand this was Japanese tapas, but for $35+ I better be full. Even Spanish tapas at Tapeo could make me full at that price."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Very good sausage I got rabbit but honestly couldn't taste much of a difference between rabbit and regular sausage but was a little more gamey.

In the end we ordered:\\n\\n-Aburi Salmon mentaiko mayo (3/5): Good flavouring but something was wrong with the rice. Either they added too much vinegar or they didn't use sushi rice. Was too hungry to inspect. Presentation was a bit sloppy. \\n\\n-Aburi Hamachi pesto (3.5/5): I want to give this one a higher rating because I really like Hamachi and it went really well with the pesto but I just can't due to the same reason as the above aburi nigiri.

I always order the grilled chicken salad with peanut sauce and honey-lime vinaigrette. It's an ample portion, and while it's a little pricey, I've yet to find anything that comes close. It's sweet, it's nutty, it's packed with flavor, and the chicken is super moist. The tortilla strips add a special crunch I simply can't ignore. I also tried my boyfriend's Thai noodle salad, a spicy mix of noodles, chicken, red pepper flakes, herbs, and lettuce. It had a kick for sure, but nothing even the most sensitive of palettes couldn't handle. Yum.\\n\\nMy only issue here would be that it's super dark. I call it the Cave of Doom. Tiny spotlights light up your table and food but nothing else, so I told my friend that if he ever had a date he didn't want to look at, he knows where to go now, ha. Prices are also a little high, but not too bad if you stick to salads and sandwiches.\\n\\nTIP #1: If you hate valet - which they do here - you can park on the cross street!\\n\\nTIP #2: While they took us in our casual finest, they definitely prefer you look a little bit classier than \\"I rolled out of bed and want a nice filet.\\""},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The atmosphere in here is pretty cool but in my opinion the food wasn't too great. My girlfriend got the classic burger which was ok and I got the $9 chicken and waffle sliders (they were three small bites each) which were alright the regular chicken and waffles which is about 4x the amount of food for less than $5 looked more promising. The mac n cheese tasted like it was box made pasta roni shells and white cheddar from Safeway.

It's generally a bit more in love with itself than I am with its food. Canoe, though tasty, falls into this  category. Although a tad snootier than tasty, I have eaten at Canoe three times--though each time I have been increasingly less impressed. \\n\\nThe first time I frequented Canoe I made a point to try as much as possible. I was with a group of four for a dinner birthday, and we all tried different appetizers, cocktails, and entrees. The prosciutto wrapped rabbit was fabulous. It wasn't too gamey as rabbit can sometimes be. That was definitely the stand out. As an entree I got the striped bass with baby brussel sprout risotto. Fantastic. I know brussel sprouts are not for everyone, but if you have even the slightest interest, try them at Canoe. \\n\\nAfter this initial fabulous meal punctuated by copious amounts of inebriating beverages (try pairing a smoky cabernet with the rabbit), I was eager to return to Canoe. \\n\\nA year later, I went back twice in the same week. I was disappointed. I got a whole fish...I cannot remember the type of fish. It's not important. What is important is that the fish was overcooked. It was overcooked and fishy. Okay, it happens, but when I told my waiter about it, I was met with a bit of snoot. Yes, snoot. \\n\\nI was also not quite as inebriated during this visit as I was on the first visit, I should note. \\n\\nThe moral of my Canoe story? Good food, hit or miss service, decent atmosphere depending on your table, tasty cocktails and decent wine list, appetizers are better than entrees (but I find that the case in many nicer restaurants), and a bit overpriced for the uniqueness and quality of the meal. \\n\\nBut maybe I just wasn't drunk enough to appreciate the brilliance that is Canoe."},{"name":"Local Roots","address":"15 E Olentangy St","city":"Powell","stars":"4","text":"Updating this to 3 stars for the way Jessi the owner immediately responded to my post and listened to my comments.

I'm didn't get a chance to have any fried radish cake because that cart didn't come out until we were ready to leave.  Royal China is slightly better than the other two dim sum places (Canton House and Happy Valley) for different reasons.

And yes, I agree its not the cheapest Chinese food around. And yes, the egg rolls and even the won ton soup are just ok, but jeez, people, if you are going to rate a place on a side dish alone, or that its not as cheap as Panda Express, I suppose you should probably stick to Panda Express. \\nHaving said that, let me start my review. I ordered online for pick up. I did speak with the owner and he said he would deliver if you request it and he's not too busy. I live less than a mile away, so for me its fairly easy to go by and pick up, but I opt for delivery most of the time if its available. The place has only been open a few months, and it seems clean and inviting. \\nI ordered the Sauteed Trio Combo (13.95) and added Soup and egg roll for 2.00 more. So, 15 and change for one person....again, not your Panda Express prices, so I would expect a better experience for the extra moula.\\nFood was great, very hot (temp), tasty(although next time ill ask for a little more spicy, I asked for medium this time), and overall, I didnt mind parting with my 15 duckettes for the food. Yes, the egg rolls werent all that great, so guess what? Next time I wont add the soup or egg roll. Soup I just tasted for the review...not bad, but I was full from the rest of the food. \\nI will definitely make this a regular place to eat. Its right next to my liquor store, so yes, very convenient. Delivery will make it that much easier to order dinner for kids when I have them, and I dont have to cook! \\nOne pet peeve I did notice when I went to pick up my order. The owner was mopping the floor while his employees were standing around texting on their cell phones. Now, Im not sure why he was mopping, maybe hes a control freak, I dont know. And the pet peeve isnt that he was doing the mopping...it was the fact that the \\"girls\\" he had working there were texting on the phone, and one even made a call while she was obviously not on break. So, to the owner, grow a back bone, and have a policy of NO cell phones while on duty. The only thing that allowing employees to have cell phones out does is lower customer service, distract employees, and it looks completely unprofessional. Thats it, just had to vent on that."},{"name":"Oga's Japanese Cuisine","address":"915 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"as ROCK SOLID as it gets, in terms of all the japanese restaurants in the boston area.  there is something to be said about a japanese restaurant where the head chef is japanese.  fresh sashimi and well-crafted sushi with just the right rice flavoring, every single time.  their tempura is as good as places in japan.  their black sesame sorbet is to die for.\\n\\nthe interior is spacious, chic but non-pretentious, and just really well-designed.  the food is better than fugakyu (there's something about the subtlety of the food here that is japanese through and through, unlike at fugakyu), the place is more spacious and accessible and cheaper than oishii.  still not cheap, but the prices are reasonable... esp if you come for lunch."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Nice place....just make sure you plan ahead of time to beat the crowds.

We live in Broomfield and decided to spend a good chunk of our day in Boulder. We have tried a fair number of pho restaurants and found them all to be about the same as the next. I feel that way about Vina Pho & Grill. However, it was their customer service that set them apart in my opinion. We walked in past noon on a Sunday and it was slow. We ordered a thai iced tea and fresh shrimp spring rolls as an appetizer. I always order thai iced tea whenever it's available and I thought it was wayyyyy too sweet this time around. It was so sweet that I had to dilute it with water! Shrimp spring rolls were made with fresh ingredients, but it was missing a kick of flavor. I think it must've been some kind of basil that was missing, but I am not certain what ingredients they're supposed to have at all times. We both ordered pho with everything in medium. Let's just say I went in super hungry, but still couldn't finish the bowl. There was plenty of meat. During the time we first sat and received our food, almost the entire dining area filled up. They were extremely understaffed with two servers, yet they made sure to greet each customer with a big smile. As someone who served tables before, those two somehow managed to deliver great customer service. Even when they were swamped, they kept our water glasses full and stayed attentive the entire time."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"10215 SE Stark","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I love this starbucks.

You get a whole stack of dried rice paper, hot water, and the fresh vegetables for your spring rolls. Honestly, you don't need to order anything else since its super filling. But we always order nem cuon as well. The sauce for it is different, not exactly sure what it is. The red hot sauce at the table is the best, hot and garlicy. \\n\\nAlso for the first time tried the 7 course beef. It was definitely an experience, but don't think I would get it again. I don't remember the courses in order but some of the courses were cooking the beef in broth, butter beef, raw beef, beef congee, the beef skewers and steamed beef ball.

I'd never had Moroccan food before, so I was excited to try something different. I'm glad I did, I had a great, well-balanced meal. \\n\\nI loved the simplicity of the menu, you choose a protein, a base, sauce, and salad. I ordered the braised beef, a base of couscous, white garlic sauce, and the mix greens salad. \\n\\nUnlike some pictures others posted, the salad, beef, and couscous were not blended together but were kept separate. The beef was on top of the couscous, but the salad was kept separate. As trivial as this sounds, I'm not a great fan of couscous in my salad, and this allowed the salad to be dressed separately (more on this later).\\n\\nThe braised beef was soft and tender. I had braised beef at home before, and this was on-par with home-cooked quality. The only difference is that at home we don't use Moroccan spices, and the amount of spice was perfect. \\n\\nI also quite enjoyed the garlic sauce too! They didn't skimp on it, and it didn't overwhelm the beef or its delicate blend spices. \\n\\nThe couscous was cooked perfectly and is a nice alternative to rice. Even if you aren't feeling adventurous, not a bad choice if you're looking for a break from rice. \\n\\nThe green salad was a pretty standard green salad, a nice, fresh addition to the meal, in contrast to the warm beef and couscous. It was also dressed ever so gently (raspberry vinaigrette, I believe).\\n\\nIt was a little on the expensive side, but pretty on par with what I've come to expect from other food trucks. \\n\\nFinally, I'll say this: I am not really a fan of braised meat, but that doesn't take away from the home-cooked quality. I was planning on giving four stars but found nothing in my experience that would cost them a star.

I was very surprised when we first got there and we showed the Yelp 30% off to the waitress and she said that we were the first one she had seen and she didn't even know what Yelp was. Of course, this was the perfect opportunity to tell her all about yelp and how it was a great social media for foodies and how she was missing out if she didn't know anything about it. She took the information to her boss, who, of course, knew what was going on and he okayed our 30% off.\\n Hawkers mainly deals in small plates, soups, salads, and noodles. We ordered four different small plates: Rhoti Canai, chicken dumplings, twice fried wings, and roast duck lettuce wraps. (see my photos on my check in.) When these didn't fill us up, we ordered a Tom Yum soup to share and some bao rolls. The soup had shrimp and vegetables, with red sauce, but it was very spicy. The bao rolls had roasted duck and other shredded vegetables and they were very tasty.  Be careful of the sticker shock! We ordered four small plates and two other items and two glasses of wine, without thinking of the cost of each one. Our dinner for that night was $60. Thank God we had the 30% off. But I understand that they have happy hour from 3 to 6 PM and from 10 to close. Where drinks and small plates are $3 each. When we were finished with dinner the manager on duty came over and spoke with us. He was asking us about Yelp, and even asked us if we were with the Elite group. Of course we proudly proclaimed that we were! He didn't know that much about Yelp so we add to educate him to about how important Yelp is to the social media foodies. We also let him know that it's worldwide; as my son bookmarked restaurants in Norway when he was there on work.  All in all, I would say the food was pretty darn good. But I would caution you, if you don't wanna spend too much money, go during happy hour. Or just get the entr√©es and don't feel like you have to order too much food like we did!

I taste the cod and it is good but the alkaline of the fish is quite strong.   The source is like bouillabaisse which is also strong.   I guess the chef is trying to cover the strong fish taste.

So, I was disappointed, but not disappointed enough to spill the truth to the owner when he asked about our meal on the way out.

If you have any reason to celebrate, whether it is an anniversary or a graduation, you should definitely treat you and your family and friends to a night at Canoe. The chef changes the menu daily so you know everything is freshly prepared and seasoned, and don't feel like you have to order fish, I've tried a decadent duck dish here before that was suburb. Most of the dishes have a gourmet southern flare with cream based sauces on top of grilled fish with a side of roasted vegetables or a bowl of Vidalia onion soup. Be sure to ask the waiters what wine pairs best with your dinner. And because you are most likely celebrating, my as well order dessert and coffee to finish the meal, or split a dessert if your  watching your figure.  After the meal, feel free to walk and take pictures amongst the flowers in the gardens or by the river bend. My family and I definitely got that perfect family shot to send to all my relatives when my brother graduated.

It took an excessive time to get our food, she was M.I.A. for long periods and she never asked the table if were enjoying our food.  I'll give them credit for hot appetizers hot.  However, they get no credit for serving lukewarm entrees.  Diners at another table received there entrees and complained of cold vegetables.  They were sent back and still came back cold and not hot.  One of the diners in my party asked for a box, the waitress brought the box to the table, he proceeded to box his food.....readers are you ready for this the waitress says to him in a very unprofessional tone \\"I'll get it!\\"  I guess the pastry chef was trying to be creative with the desserts because there was a fruit sauce smeared on plate as if it has been wiped with a cloth.

Killer Burgers....ehh.....I don't know if the taste will kill you but the price and the wait might.  The seating and ordering situation here is similar to a mad house due to the fact that this place is small, cramped and over crowded. \\n\\nThe Menu. \\nThis place offers beef, turkey and either vegan or veggie burgers - sorry I saw a V and didn't pay that much attention to which word  it was.  There's two options build your own or order the ones they've already created (which run between $6.50 and $8.00).  \\nAs for build your own,  after picking the type of 'meat' you pick a size there is a junior ($5) which i want to say is 1/4 lb and then a larger size ($6.50). From there you pick your sauce (which is included) and then you pick your topping...which are NOT included in the price of the burger, and as you can imagine the price per pickle, tomato etc., is something ridiculous like 75 cent each.\\nThere's not combo meals so after you have a $7 burger you will have the option to pay an add'l $3 for fries and another $2-3 for a beverage.  They also offer sweet potato fries and milkshakes/malts if that's you thing - each run approx. $5.\\n\\nI had a turkey burger and a strawberry milkshake. My grand total was about $12.  The shake was good....the burger was questionable. Yes it killed the hunger pains and I am thankful for that but my patty was super thin and crispy....and not delicious. I had one of the pre designed burgers the first one on the list that came with some unnoticeable special Grind House sauce. Overall my food should have been $8, based on quality and taste. \\n\\nThere is a bar, yay for liquor! I know for a fact serves beer which will make some people happy.  Unfortunately I don't know if it's a full bar that also sells hard liquor and or wine. \\n\\nSeating.\\nOne word crowded nightmare.  I am actually impressed by the number of tables and chairs this place was able to squeeze in such a small space without violating a fire code. This place makes the burgers to order which means there's a ton of people in this place lurking and just hovering around the tables waiting on their food.  In total if I had to guess I say there are about 8 metal high-top tables in this place and about 8 seats at the bar. Note- this seating is not table service.  The employees yell your name and you have to go up and get your order.  There's no hostess to seat you so fight through the crowd and try to find a seat at your own risk. \\n\\n\\nIt's not worth running and catching the train to get here but if this is in your terminal and you want a burger bite the bullet have lots of patience and eat here."},{"name":"Chi'Lantro","address":"11005 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Okay so this food was really good, although I it did not agree with my stomach so I won't be having it again, it was still good and I encourage you to at least try it.

It was actually cheaper and I got to support a local business."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been to Ball Square a dozen times since moving to the area several months ago, and the food has almost always been great! The pancakes are amazing. And I don't even like pancakes. Somehow, Ball Square manages to avoid the \\"sameness\\" that a lot of pancakes suffer from. Theirs aren't thick and don't require a swig of coffee with each bite, which is something I've experienced at a lot of other breakfast places. Plus, the whipped cream is so good that I haven't had syrup with my pancakes there ever. The omelettes have also been a big hit; in particular, the black bean salsa omelette is a really winning combination.\\n\\nAs a vegetarian, I also really appreciate the vegetarian sausage. It's got a meaty and satisfying texture, although is a bit oily. I tried the artichoke hearts eggs benedict, and the hollandaise sauce was, quite frankly, bland, thick, and oddly textured. It was also an alarming shade of neon yellow! The whole thing was flavorless, and I left feeling pretty disappointed; thank goodness I got a half-order and not a full one.\\n\\nThe service has been hit-or-miss. Several times we have arrived early enough that there's no line and the restaurant is mostly empty, and we've still been rushed by waitstaff. That is likely just a carry-over from the fact that they're packed much of the time; but if I make the effort to go out for breakfast at 7:30 on a weekday to avoid a line and dine at my leisure, I should be able to.\\n\\nOverall, a great neighborhood breakfast place! I wouldn't recommend ordering off the lunch menu, even if it's lunchtime -- Ball Square does breakfast very well, but their lunch is fairly standard.

I don't hold this against the staff at all--they delivered exactly the kind of experience they set out to, it's just not my kind of experience. From the Applebee's-style tchotchkes adorning the walls to the sticker shock-inducing holy-crap-can-that-be-the-right-number prices on their entrees, everything about this place turned me off. The blue cheese & bacon burger I had was serviceable, but in no way deserving of its $14 price. It also seemed odd to me that the server specifically warned me that my burger might be pink when I ordered it medium (I mean...that's what I would expect) and the burger still came to my table a dark shade of brown throughout.

I got there early and had a Kombucha on tap; I did notice the large (and varied selection) of beer at a pretty darn good price.\\n\\nOnce everyone arrived, though, the troubles began.  We were seated quickly on the large outdoor benches and the weather was pleasant enough, but the service?  Oh man....\\n\\nTo begin, the waitress took 20 minutes to come take our order.  While it wasn't dead, they weren't packed either (I'd say about 60% full outside, and inside was empty), and I find that to be an unacceptable wait, especially when we were waiting to order our first round of beer.  When she finally did arrive, the bar was out of several of the brews we'd wanted.  Credit where it's due, the waitress did suggest an excellent substitute.\\n\\nAnother 30 minutes passed before our first round came out.  We placed our food order at the time, praying to eat before the sun collapsed and went nova, ending all life in the solar system.  We were wrong.  It took around an hour for six sausages to show up, one of them was wrong and our appetizers and sides were missing.  Notably, each time we received food or drinks, it was delivered by someone OTHER than the waitress who took our order.\\n\\nThe waitress attempted to explain bringing the wrong thing out by saying that they were out of what was ordered and what she brought was \\"the same thing with a different name\\".\\n\\nReally?  I mean, really?  *sigh*\\n\\nWe eventually gave in and ate what we were brought.  The sausage was okay, but I found my venison/antelope mix to be on the overcooked side; the meat inside the casing was downright chewy, and more so than any dead deer had a right to be.  The spicy mustard had clearly been having a love affair with a horseradish, since that was 70% of the taste (man, what a KICK), but it was still good.  The curry ketchup was great, and the sauerkraut wasn't bad either.  I did find that the pickled vegetables were freaking amazing.\\n\\nAt several points, we just started walking to the bar to get our drinks, since the waitress couldn't be relied on if you wanted your beverage in less than 30 minutes.  \\n\\nEventually, a manager came out to talk to us.  Then another one came out.  And actually, we ended up talking to four of them (who has four managers?), and they eventually comped the wrongly delivered sausage.  You know what really bothered me the most?\\n\\nI can forgive a restaurant - especially a new one - service snafus.  It takes time and experience to get a working system, to get used to your peers and supervisors, and the kitchen, and so on.  I'm a tolerant, patient kinda guy.  Yet not ONE of the four managers OR the waitress actually owned up to the mistake.\\n\\nI heard a lot of \\"we're sorry you had trouble\\" and \\"I'm sorry your experience didn't live up to expectations\\" but I never heard \\"I'm sorry we messed up, how can we fix it for you?\\"  Not once.  And that pissed me off, because I know what that means - it means that you don't think you did anything wrong, and you're just pandering to a whiny customer you don't care about.  People who care about what they do, management who cares about the businesses they run, THOSE people own their mistakes, because that's how they get fixed.\\n\\nSo the food was good, but not amazing, the beer selection was quality and prices were good, but the service was bad and the management was utterly atrocious.  I'll be honest, I'll probably go back because they have an off-leash dog run and a good beer selection, but I doubt I'll do anything but buy beer from the bar while Waffles (my little fat girl) tries to hump dogs six times her size."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place sucks.

Found myself in Orlando for a work conference, and all my traveling foodie friends told me Orlando is dead when it comes to the food scene. I was determined to find something outside of your national chains, and utilized my handy-dandy Yelp app to find the higher rated places around town.  This popped up, and having just watched Chef, I had Cuban Sandwiches on my mind.  Done, I'll check this place out because of its high rating and that the reviews raved about the Cubans.\\n\\nGot here after the noon hour, and it was pretty packed, mostly with men (and seemed like they were mostly construction workers). I told my co-worker that it looked like we hit the jackpot.  Yeah, we stood out like a sore thumb, being the only females in the establishment, and the female workers especially doted on us because they probably figured we were out of our element (which we were).  \\n\\nWe ordered two Cubanos, some sweet fried plaintains (I wanted the salty ones but they were out), and a dessert of some sort. The food was authentic and the Cuban Sandwich was huge! All for $5 too, so such an amazing deal.

It is easy access from Peachtree St. and there is valet parking behind the restaurant. \\n\\nThe place is large, with a old school, I'm in Paris feel. During the summer, there is a nice patio where you can have just drinks or dinner. The bar area is pretty large and situated in the front of the restaurant. However, one of the things I found confusing is the check in area which is located in the rear of the restaurant near the kitchen. There is also a back door to enter which I find the easiest when I'm coming in for dinner, this way you are not walking all around the restaurant feeling lost. I've not had to wait for a table even on busy nights. My biggest complaint is that the place can be a bit dark in the evening once the sun goes down, making it hard to read the menu even for me.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty straight-forward.  If you have any questions, just ask. And yes, it is written in English even though it is a French restaurant. The wine list is pretty decent, and they have wines by the glass. Typically I choose the malbec which is delicious.  For an appetizer, I've had the French onion soup, which is just the perfect mix of broth and onions, with a lovely slice of French bread and cheese on top. The burrata mozzarella salad is very delicious as well. For dinner, I've had the la bouillabaisse which was warm, sweet, and very filling. The seafood was moist and not over cooked. The Loup de mer is a sea bass that was tender, creamy, with a like butter smooth consistency, just plain delicious, and I got it without the capers.  Not a fan of capers! The steak au poivre is decent, medium well, with plenty of flavor. The side dish of the creamed spinach was fantastic, probably one of the better side dishes. My favorite dish is the beef bourguignon which consists of the kobe beef cheeks braised in burgundy wine with noodles which is always top notch, which is why it is my go-to dish. Pricing is what one would expect for good food!\\n\\nThe bathroom is off to the side, which was very clean and neat.

My gym is literally right across from this place, I finished my work out and was in need of food, mostly protein. As I left the gym, I scouted my options. It was either, tacos, burgers, pizza or thai food. Even though those did sound so delicious when you're famish, I just wasn't feeling like bombing my calorie intake after leaving the gym. So I read a few reviews and looked at the menu and I was sold. This place is your typical neighborhood diner, with the friendly staff and a menu filled with comfort food. The moment I walked in, I was greeted by the staff and was told to sit wherever. The place is decent in size and gets pretty busy on a weekend/ dinner rush. I settled for the steak (PROTEIN), and asked to just get extra servings of whatever seasonal vegetables they had in place of the mashed potato. Service was quick, prompt, friendly and my glass of water was always full! The steak was great (I wasn't really sure what cut it would be, so I should have probably ordered medium rare.), nevertheless it still was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The side dish of asparagus was seasone and cooked well. This place reminded me of Division growing up. This would be the perfect place where I would meet up with my high school friends, grab lunch before our next class starts. This place is very casual, nothing fancy. It's a great place to have excellent conversations with friends or family. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Incredibly juicy and tender, with grease literally dripping from the burger with every bite. I was a bit surprised that it was served on a cutting board with any lip to catch the juices, but then i realized that it was getting soaked into the onion rings that were served with the burger, which just made the onion rings that much better!\\n\\nThe fried chicken was also great. Usually I think of fried chicken as a sort of fast/comfort food, so it's quite a treat to see what people can do when they take the concept of fried chicken, refine it just a little bit, and turn it into a gourmet meal. \\n\\nOne thing I was quite impressed with is that their local sourcing includes their beverage selection. As a result they make their own drinks in lieu of soda's. While they're not carbonated, they're still amazing. I can't remember exactly what I had but it was some sort of lemon lime drink that wasn't overly sweet yet still refreshing.\\n\\nOne quick note on pricing, if you look at the online sample menu, the items that seem unusually expensive are probably meant for two people.

The service and the atmosphere are terrible and why, without some kind of promotional coupon, I would NEVER come back.  The first two times I went there was a really nice  server but the last two...WTF??  The only reason I can think that a restaurant would continue to employ someone who can't remember what a patron orders, brings the wrong food, and starts to clean up before you are even finished eating is he is your son or you murdered someone and you've employed him for his silence.  He SUCKS and should never work in the service industry.  Loud, obnoxious, dim-witted.  I simply don't understand.

Burgers are in plenty. So too are wraps, and the occasional fried donut and pickle seems to always find its way into our mouth. But college is a time of trying new things, of being brave and bold in decisions and unflinching to their consequences. College is a time to find that home away from home and defining yourself based on your own experiences. \\n\\nOma's Kitchen is a catalyst for this transformation. When I came to college, I was but a mere caterpillar. But through the motherly hands of this establishment, I've transcended to the likes of butterfly-hood. As an individual who both enjoys and was raised on Korean food, Oma's Kitchen is a healthy, cheap, and practical alternative for those wishing to expand their palette, as well as for those who miss mother's (oma's) cooking much like myself. A mom and pop set-up, the layout is very simple and potluckish, bringing to mind fond childhood memories of a warm, communal meal with the parents. Despite the oppressive atmosphere of downtrodden Dobie, Oma's Kitchen is a wick of hope. The staff is warm and welcoming, just like the food they serve. One young man in particular is a charismatic stallion, enticing a multitude of people (usually females) from across campus with his dashing propriety. The way he pronounces the exotic cuisine from the Far East is... captivating. Persuasive, yet caring. Affirmative, though humble. His hazelnut hair brings seasonal flair and seasonal cheer. His directive and pronouncing voice is irresistible. When not serving, his piercing eyes are searching the masses of people in the food court, a sea of opportunity where he is the captain of the ship known as Oma's Kitchen. His eyes, like the ocean, are all too easy to get lost in. And once you are captured in his sight, once those intense eyes connect with your's, there is a moment of intimacy. With that, you have no choice. Oma's Kitchen is the only the answer to your problems.   \\n\\nPerfection.  \\n\\nIn all seriousness, Oma's Kitchen really does serve a great purpose to the UT community. For those interested in expanding their cultural horizon, this is an authentic and non-intimidating (as in no \\"weird\\" stuff) option. From someone who has had eaten a lot of Korean food,  the price-to-authentic-to-taste ratio is pretty solid. The lunch special is only a few bucks, so it won't kill anyone to try it out. While authentic Korean BBQ is preferable in taste, the price tends to be three times as much and requires a twenty minute drive. Oma's Kitchen is perfect for the interested college student who is on a budget. Come try it out. If you don'y enjoy the food, you'll at least enjoy the service... that beautiful, beautiful service."},{"name":"Southern Sweets Bakery","address":"186 Rio Cir","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"A quaint little spot, in a non-descript location, but well worth a stop if you're in the area.

The bf got some jalapeno dish that was apparently incredibly spicy. So much so he was sweating, etc. I made a very dinner-appropriate remark about how I that while I enjoy spicy food, I wouldn't even go there because it wasn't worth the consequences (i.e. Spicy in, three times as spicy coming out). In a moment of sheer genius I then came up with the word \\"Fire-rhea.\\" We were dying. I cannot possibly be the first person that thought of this word, but it was the first time either of us had considered the notion. I am giggling even still as I write. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the older couple next to us were having a discussion about prairie dogs. Ok, so I'm a freak, but I fell more in love in that very moment. \\n\\nNow for the review:\\n\\nHai Ky is hidden away in the corner of a shopping center but is nice inside - small, but clean and comfortable. Good for a date cuz lots of little tables and feels nice even though it's casual.  \\n\\nSo the only items I have tried here thus far are the fresh spring rolls and chicken satay. Springs rolls weren't spectacular - too much roll, not enough filling - but had great sauce. The satay was a stand out because for $6 bucks you get 4 skewers, which is  about three chicken breasts worth. Score! I ate one while there and got two to go. (A perfect snack when cold, btw)\\n\\nNext time we went, we ordered To go, and I loaded up on chicken satay! (Call ahead, they do make everything on the spot and while it doesn't take long, we had enough time to cruise the strip)\\n\\nThey make the iced coffee in those little personal manual breweries (sorry, I'm sure they have a name), and when mixed with condensed milk it is, per usual, amazing. If you need a sugar/caffeine fix, one of these babies will set you up. \\n\\nI also tried some coconut \\"juice\\" that came in a can with bits of coconut in it.

My wife was freshly coiffed and manicured and looked very stylish in a black blazer trimmed with Ukrainian rabbit. I can't understand what marked us as provincials, because something obviously did as we were treated by the hostess and our waitress with curt, perfunctory service which eventually devolved into outright rude treatment. \\n\\nThere is not an item on the menu which did not contain at least one word in the description of the dish that I was not familiar with. Our waitress arrived in good time but as she tried to answer our questions about specific menu items her attitude seemed patronizing and arrogant. The menu was obviously too sophisticated and nuanced for us philistines.\\n\\nThe unpleasant experience reached critical mass when my wife had the temerity to ask our waitress for hot sauce (for her oysters) and distracted our waitress from an obviously more important mission. My wife asked \\"Do you have any hot sauce?\\"  She put her hands on the edge of the table, leaned her substantial body over towards my wife, and with a steely determined look answered \\"NO!\\" Not No, I am sorry we do not, or any other explanation, just NO! and stayed there looking defiant.  It was really quite bizarre. While she remained leaning over the table and glaring at my wife, my wife said \\"you don't have any hot sauce or cocktail sauce? Again without blinking she emitted a resounding NO!  This woman appeared to be infuriated at a very visceral level.  Her malevolent expression reminded me of the Medusa's head while being held aloft by Perseus in the old greek mythology illustrations. All that was missing were some snakes protruding from her head. If she thought she would intimidate my wife however, she was mistaken - my wife was granted political asylum here, having survived KGB interrogations and persecution in her native country.   Finally she stood up and stated imperiously \\"Those are Misty Point oysters, they don't need any sauce! \\"Then why did it come with this onion sauce? queried my wife. \\"That's not onion sauce, its shallot sauce!\\" snarled our waitress. \\n\\nWe should have just left at that point, but we were on vacation, and looking for a pleasant dining experience with our old friend, not an ugly scene with an attitudinal waitress. I said \\"Look, we have eaten oysters at about 100 different restaurants in New Orleans, served 1000 different ways (admittedly a slight exaggeration) and had hot sauce with all of them.\\"  She retreated somewhat at that point and said something to the effect that yes, they have good oysters in New Orleans, but the chef here does not allow hot sauce on the premises. I said \\"Well I guess we are just the proletariat of shellfish eaters.\\" She then offered to take the oysters back, but my wife decided to eat them sans hot sauce. \\nIt would be easy to criticize the food after that bizarre episode, but the beef short ribs dish which they brought out was a disaster. It was called a beef short rib dish, but I could find only 3 small (marble sized) pieces of meat in the mixture of turnips, carrots, and gnocchi buttons. It tasted very much like the canned Dinty Moore stew we ate as children, but without the meat. Our waitress asked how I liked my dish (is it possible my order was sabotaged?) I told her it had hardly any beef in it. She said \\"What can I do to make it better?\\" I just said \\"Bring me the check\\".  Our friend had a duck dish which he said looked good, but was not flavorful. To be fair, my wife had two other appetizers which she said were quite good. \\nI left her $15.00 tip on an $87 bill and got away from there, never to return. I would have been justified leaving a smaller tip, but I didn't want to stiff the bus staff or bartenders (sometimes they pool their tips). So I paid $102 so I could have the privilege of eating a pedestrian entr√©e while being talked down to and menaced by an inexplicably rude waitress. \\n\\nI am hardly an epicurean gourmet, but I have been fortunate enough in my life to eat in a lot of fine restaurants and private clubs. My wife and our companion both have post graduate degrees in music and are widely travelled. It is not like we don't know how to act in polite society. That's why I am completely at a loss as to what triggered the animosity towards us at this establishment. \\n\\nThankfully, we had wonderful food and dining experiences at other Decatur restaurants (The Mac Mcgee Irish Pub, and Parkers on Ponce) during our stay. Cake and Ale may do just fine without our patronage in the future, but you know what, my life will continue to be just fine without ever having to darken their door again."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here on the first night of my portland adventure.

The 2nd was worth darn near 5 stars.\\n\\n1st Visit - February, 2016:\\nI've always heard about Ruth's Chris on the radio and from friends, but never decided to go there. I had decided to take my girlfriend on a weekend getaway down to the InterContinental Hotel (next door) and have a romantic dinner. We decided on Ruth's Chris because it was right next door. We both ordered the filet and shared some asparagus. The asparagus tasted like it was overseasoned and overcooked - almost chewy. The filets were not very tender - seemed a bit chewy and had an inordinate amount of gristle and fat, particularly for a filet. We were not impressed. I've had better steaks at Stoney River. The service was good, though.\\n\\n2nd Visit - January, 2017:\\nComplete 180 degree turnaround from last time. We couldn't get any reservations at any local restaurants for the night we visited. We were doing the same as last year - romantic night away from it all. We were really disappointed when Ruth's Chris was the only place that had reservations available.

Even though I got locked out, about a few months back, after I got done eating here, that should not stop me from returning. Because after speaking to family about this issue, I was told to come back, and give it a second chance. So that's what's going to happen very soon. And if this location has had issues where they have to keep the doors locked after a certain time, especially at night, that is totally understandable. The lady who took my order  from the last time I was here, was very nice in fact. She is also the one that told me, that there has been too many problems here at this location. I'm not quite sure what problems they've had here, but if they've had too many problems involving people coming in demanding free food, and just basically going all over the restaurant asking for free food, and begging for it, then that's totally understandable.  You need to protect yourself, especially if your business is still opened at night, because you want to prevent certain kinds of people from entering and demanding free food, and taking a bunch of stuff. And that's totally understandable. During the day, it's probably not so much of an issue, but during the night, boy oh boy, it can be an issue. I am a saxophonist, and I play out in the community for people, and if I could, I would play for the nice lady, who told me about this issue, after being let back inside, when hailing a Lyft car, from months back. the good news is, I don't have to be outside anymore, when hailing a Lyft car. Because the Lyft app, now remembers drop off locations. So for example, I could be inside Arby's off Washington Street, having a nice refill of my beverage, then, open the Lyft app, and it would say pick up, Arby's. And it would stay there, and it would not drift off of my current location as far as where I Matt. Which is very nice.I could be inside hailing it, and anybody who is inside, could see it, as far as where the driver has stopped, and let me know where he or she is. So that's no longer an issue there. so, all in all, I will be back, at this location very very soon.

Unfortunately, it fell FAR below expectations and actually left me pretty upset about the entire experience.\\n\\nI've tried a bunch of carts around Portland and I have to say that this, by far, was my worst experience with any of them.  To add insult to injury, I brought my in-laws who were visiting from out of town here.\\n\\nWe arrived here Sunday at 1 p.m. and there was a decent number of people sitting around eating (no line at Cascade Burger so it wasn't like we came during a lunch rush.)  The person working there (owner I assume) informed us that each of us needed to fill out a little order form.  With that out of the way, we sat down to wait for our burgers.  We ordered a few sodas and a shake and after about 10 minutes of waiting, went up to the cart to ask for our drinks.  He didn't have the shake ready and with sodas in hand we proceeded to wait for another 10 minutes for our food.  He finally brought out the burgers (the fries apparently still weren't ready and the shake still hadn't been made.)  He forgot the avocado that we ordered on each of the burgers (even though we had filled out the form at his insistence) and then acted annoyed/frazzled at having to fix his mistake. I had the veggie burger and rather than \\"epic\\" it was a soggy tasteless patty.\\n\\nWhen the shake finally came out it it was super runny (my 3 year old son had no objections though.)  \\n\\nThe fries came out last and they by far were the highlight in my opinion. My in-laws and husband said that their burgers were really good (but the food most definitely didn't offset the awful service.)\\n\\nTo add some flavor to my tasteless veggie patty, I wanted to add more ketchup and went up to the cart to ask for a knife to spread some.  Again, the owner fumbled around acting frazzled and offered to give me a straw since he had no utensils.  At that point I was completely fed up with the dog and pony show going on at this cart and just wanted the whole experience to be over (not to mention I was embarrassed by how the owner acted like we were putting him out at every turn rather than trying to act appreciative of the fact he had customers.)

Once the brief ceremony was over, we were treated to a buffet in the restaurant. They had a good portion of the restaurant sectioned off for the party and we were seated by table number in a booth. Since the wedding reception was not huge, they were still able to run business in the other section of the restaurant.

We had just eaten breakfast at Biscuits that morning so the Metropolitan Bistro was fresh in our mind. So we decided to give it a try. \\n\\nWe arrived a little before six on a Saturday evening and the place was busy. We got the last available table in the dining room. We would have considered the bar but it's not well set up to eat in with high small round tables that barely have room for two drinks. \\n\\nWe were seated promptly and our waiter was quick to come by and get our drink order. As our friends hadn't shown up yet we ordered a couple of ice teas and the hummus and tzatziki plate. \\n\\nShortly after our other couple arrived the waiter brought our appetizer plate. I was surprised at the plate as I was expecting your typical plate with a few scraps of bread to mop up the dips. What we got was a decent sized serving of pita, cucumber slices, celery and some asparagus stalks. \\n\\nTo be honest the hummus and tzatziki is not as good as the gyro place down the street but it was pretty decent. I don't know if they make the hummus on site but it wasn't as creamy as I like it. I know that removing the chickpea skins is a pain but it makes all the difference. Still this was a nice appetizer and I'd definitely order it again. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken wraps and a small order of fries. The wraps are similar to those at PF Changs. The dish included ~five romaine leaves of varying size! a couple of scoops or the chicken filling and a big scoop of white rice. The romain was nice and crisp and the rice cooked right. The chicken was quite tasty with nice spiciness. If I had a complaint it was that the chicken was too hot (temperature) for a lettuce wrap. A few degrees cooler would have been nice. \\n\\nFor me the big disappointment was the fries. The menu advertised twice cooked fries. If these fries were twice cooked then they need to reevaluate their process. The fries were nicely browned and well seasoned but they were limp. The reason you twice cook fries to to get that crisp golden brown fry. Personally, I'd prefer to have crisp over brown any day as limp fries are often oil as well. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the stroganoff. The meal was well prepared with firm noodles and beef with just enough chew. Personally, I didn't care for the sauce that was used but that's a personal thing and I won't ding them for my tastes. Overall, the stroganoff was well prepared and worth ordering. \\n\\nTwo of the meals ordered were supposed to come with bread on the side but we never got the bread. The kitchen obviously didn't prepare it and the server didn't catch the omission. \\n\\nMy wife is pretty fussy about her beer so she questioned the water about a couple of their choices. The waiter was reasonably knowledgable about their offering and was quick to offer a small sample before taking her beer order. Extra point for that. \\n\\nFor dessert we shared the key lime cheesecake. The cheesecake had a nice crust, not soggy and with a nice graham cracker flavor. The cheesecake had a nice consistency, a little softer than the Cheesecake Factory but I kind of like my filling to be on the creamy side. But, and this is a big but, the filling either needed more lime juice or zest or less sugar. The sweetness overpowered the lime flavor. \\n\\nWe'll be going back to try their HH menu as soon as the weather gets nice enough to sit on the patio and maybe to give dinner another chance. \\n\\nOverall, our server was friendly and efficient. They refilled my iced tea without being prompted and quickly brought me another lemon slice when asked. \\n\\nMetropolitan Bistro has all the pieces to be a great little neighborhood eatery so give it a try when you're in the area."},{"name":"First Printer","address":"13-15 Dunster St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been looking forward to eating here for quite a long time. Years in-fact. The decor is great. The service I would give a C+ to B-. The real gripe came at the end of the meal. There was one young cute looking waiter that delivered food and silverware who seemed especially great. Always had a smile and was very nice. When I return I would probably ask to sit in one of his tables. \\n\\nEverything I ate was tasty. As a previous review mentioned food is super rich. We had 2 apps. Lobster Pups and Shrimp and Grits. Both were excellent. I ordered the Strip steak which was the special. It was $17.00 and cooked perfectly. I like my steak cooked medium well. Most of the time people either cant get that right or want to filet it to make sure its cook well enough. I was impressed. I also got a side of Risotto. It was RICH, cheesy, and damn good. If there was one thing on the menu I would recommend this. (and maybe the lobster pups!)\\n\\nThe rest of my party didn't seem too impressed. An undercooked burger. A side of smashed potatoes that lacked flavor.  I, however, was content. I thought the food was yummy.  \\n\\nMost of the entrees averaged about $22-24. Cocktails are $10 and glasses of wine start at $6-7. \\n\\nOur biggest issue with the First Printer came at check time. We were splitting the check 3 ways. We wrote the correct amounts for each credit card on the back of the bill. 40 minutes later they still had not figured out how to split the check up between 3 cards. As this was going on my friend needed to use the bathroom. As she walked by the manager trying to figure out the credit card machine she hears the woman say \\"who orders a burger!?\\" I'm sorry but not everyone wants a lobster Po Boy. If a burger is not acceptable to you take it off the menu and we will go to Mr. Bartley's. \\n\\nWhen the check did arrive the amounts were not correct. We gave them then benefit of doubt that it was just our bad handwriting. While our waiter repeatedly apologized I really expected a manager to come over and offer an apology or perhaps a free dessert. 40 minutes to wait for a bill is a bit absurd. \\n\\nOnce got up to leave and there was only one member of our party left at the table the same manager approached him attempted an apology and made some off handed comment about having to \\"call India\\" about the credit card machine.\\n\\nIn summary...

The sausage itself was excellent but I felt it was a little spicy on spicy on spicy.  I would order this again but i would probably remove everything off of the sausage and eat it piece by piece.  I do like spicy food but when my lips start to swell, that's a bit much for me.  The flavor was great though.  Now to the cream corn.  That was absolutely insane.  Fried onions, jalape√±os, and cream corn...sign me up.  It is as good as it sounds if not more.  Adding bacon to this would make it life-changingly good.  \\n\\nNow for the beer (the best part).  They have one of if not the best beer selections I have ever seen.  I had 2 pints then decided to do a flight.  The flight is the way to go to begin with, I did it backwards unfortunately.  I would highly recommend the flights because you get to try something you may not normally and discover you really like it.  Typically I find with beer flights that the range of beer you are drinking is very gapped.  For example, going from a pilsner to a stout in the same flight.  They have flights categorized (i.e. light, ambers, lagers, etc).  \\n\\nOverall, Bangers is an excellent place and a great addition to the area.

Since I did a Thursday lunch at Thai Spice Cafe, I was reluctant do Friday dinner at Hai Ky, because there's just so much cornstarch slurry I can handle.

It was actually easy to park, the place was a little over half full, and if I had a dollar for every time I heard the waitstaff say to incoming customers, \\"sit wherever you want,\\" I'd have eight bucks. \\n\\nI went with a consensus of Yelp reviews and ordered the vermicelli with grilled pork, and I thought it was great. It's also enough for two. In addition, I always do spring rolls and an order of sesame chicken because they're my benchmarks for asian/fusion/Chinese-type places. The spring rolls were good, but the sesame chicken here was just way too gingery. (Uh, it occurs to me to mention we always eat family-style at asian-type establishments.)  Incidentally, the food comes out really fast.\\n\\nThe staff was pleasant and attentive, but delivered the check almost as quickly as the food, which I like during lunch but not necessarily at dinner.

Go too far afield and people will come up with a million excuses as to why they can't make it (\\"I have a date in two hours\\", \\"I need to help my kid with his science project\\", \\"My house is on fire\\").  If the place is close, though, people end up going because it's on the way home and it's a convenient way to get good and liquored up for the 2 hour commute back to the exurbs where their reasonably prices McMansion is.\\n\\nFor these reasons, whenever anyone of any importance is in town at my company (Director level or above), NXNW is a fairly popular choice to have an after-work get-together.  Unfortunately, it's also a very popular place for everyone else to have an after-work get-together, which means the crowd gets pretty big from around 5 to 7:30 or so most nights.  Coincidentally, this is also when they close off half their parking lot for valet service, and the parking lot is damn small to begin with.  If you work nearby you're probably better off just walking, the parking situation is just that bad.  If you do decide to go with the valet, be aware that they close the valet service at a ridiculously early hour so your keys will likely be with the bartender if you stay very long, which may actually be preferable to having to deal with the surly valet staff.\\n\\nOnce you finally manage to find somewhere to stash your car and make your way inside, the place is a fairly typical brewpub.  The food is decent if underwhelming and the beer is relatively tasty if a bit watered down.  The house brews are miles above the usual mass-produced crap you find on tap most places, but they aren't anything to write home about.   Nurse your beer slowly, because the waitstaff tends to check in very infrequently, and you run a real risk of sobering up completely between beers if you don't order at least two at a time.\\n\\nThe appetizers all taste as if they have around a million calories and are universally overpriced.  Why is it that fancy (or trying-to-be-fancy) restaurants always add a few extra spices to standard appetizers you'd find anywhere else and feel justified in charging more money for them?  More often than not the extra spices actually detract from the flavor.  It's been a while since I've had any entrees here so I can't really comment on them.\\n\\nAnyway, NXNW is neither horrible nor outstanding.  The parking situation is utterly ridiculous for a place so far north, and I'm almost tempted to knock them down to two stars just on that alone.  If I wanted difficult parking I would go downtown.  One of the perks of living up north is that we aren't supposed to have to deal with that kind of nonsense."},{"name":"Madras Pavilion","address":"9025 Research Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The memorable stuff for me here are:\\n\\npongal, channa batura, dosas \\n\\nGood spice level - they can make it quite hot for you if you like.\\n\\nVeg friendly, but I am not veg and am happy customer, they can fill anybody up.\\n\\nThey make a decent mango lassi.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't like here are their desserts.

After placing our order, our server discovered one of our choices was out, so she picked one for us to replace it. She didn't ask us if there was a different beer we wanted to pick to replace it, but we didn't particularly mind. \\n\\nAs for food, I ordered the Veggie BLT. I'm generally not a huge fan of sausages, but it was good. I wouldn't say it was the best vegetarian sausage I've ever had, but it was unique and had some good toppings. The impression I got my friends' meaty sausages were that they were very dense and filling. They also ordered sides; the fries were good, but I wasn't a big fan of the cheese grits. I thought they were somewhat bland, but as a non-Southerner, I honestly don't really know what grits are supposed to taste like. I was super tempted to order a side as well, but I didn't have room in my stomach.\\n\\nI think it's hilarious that on their physical menu, they tell you that you can get a free tattoo of their logo at a local parlor that they partnered with. I originally thought that was a bizarre idea. But after seeing all the unique and delicious options in the food and drink menus, I could imagine that they'd draw some fans. I was more smitten when I read a sign that they had an event called \\"Mega Mutt Monday\\".  I also realized that the logo is actually pretty clever. The whole feel about Banger's grew on me, and I could see why some might actually take up the tattoo offer. I personally don't intend to, but I definitely want to come back and try so many more menu options. With the right food, drink, and company, I can see myself really loving this place."},{"name":"Chicken Kabob Restaurant","address":"756 Washington St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here with my mother for lunch after reading amazing reviews.

Wife not into salmon so much, so I had three of them.  \\n\\nYum!\\n\\nEntrees: duck breast, shrimp wontons.  Both were really good, decent portion sizes.  The duck sat on some kind of cabbage, sweet/sour/au jus type sauce.  Very tasty.  One thing I noticed: I'm fine with medium-rare duck (which is how it's served), but the portions near the edge, where it was closer to medium, were actually more tender.\\n\\nSome meats actually get a little more tender closer to medium.  Next time I might request it that way.  But it was still delicious.   The shrimp were also very good, and sat on some kind of horseradish slaw that was tasty.\\n\\nDesserts: we got one of each.  One was  a spongecake soaked in at least 2+ ounces of potent rum.  Highly potent.  Watch out if you're not into rum.  The other had two cookies and a little ceramic cup of cold custard.  The custard was addictive.\\n\\nI also had a coffee, which was a high quality brew.\\n\\nThe meal also comes with frequently replenished bread and butter, thus it's impossible to leave still hungry.  \\n\\nThe space itself is an attractive looking mix of retro+modern.

The only difference is, we would normally go to the Peachtree Rd location.  To cut to the chase, the service tonight was not what I remember Houston's service to be. To start, when did Houston's start allowing its patrons to wear baseball caps while dining?  More importantly, our server was unable to tell me what ingredients were in the soup of the day, so of course, I didn't order it.  My husband had a garnishment on his plate that looked unfamiliar so we asked 2 servers what it was. One server said, she thought it was a beet. The other server said its a beet and just walked away. I may be wrong for assuming but just expect a little more of a detailed explanation when these types of questions are asked at Houston's. Lastly, I asked our server what non-alcoholic drinks were available besides soda. He stated, \\"lemonade\\". After thinking about it, I asked if cranberry juice was available and of course it was. I'm sure they also have orange and pineapple, right?  \\n\\nMy husband and I both agreed that the service did not live up to Houston's reputation and agreed that maybe it was just this location, so we'll head back to Peachtree next time.

They do have one of my most favorite appetizers. I am a huge fan of queso especially when it comes with guac in it. Not only does their queso have gauc in it, but it also has pulled pork. It is soooo delicious!!! For an entree, I ordered the chicken fried chicken. The gravy is amazing and the chicken is well seasoned and fried to perfection!

Apparently, it's under new management with a new name, and it may not be open most times?**\\n\\nI couldn't decide what to eat for a late lunch today, after walking around Whole Foods Market in downtown and not taking a particular liking to anything. So I decided to head up north to the Chinatown Center on North Lamar at Braker. I took IH  35 since I didn't want to deal with the slow-moving traffic on Lamar, and exited at Braker. As I was turning onto Lamar, I saw this sign advertising the opening of a new Thai restaurant. Since I love Thai food, I decided to check it out.\\n\\nThere's a fairly large and mostly unused strip mall at Braker/Lamar, immediately in front of the CVS/pharmacy. There's a pho place, an Asian bank, and seems like nothing else. The new Thai place, called Exotic Thai Food, is at the end. Behind it appears to be another newly opened business, this one a large Asian grocery market.\\n\\nExotic Thai has a very minimalist decor, with a widescreen TV on one wall, and wall glass panes that bring in the natural sunlight. I could care less about decor as long as the food is good. I've been to Thailand on at least nine different occasions, so I am very particular when it comes to Thai restaurants. I want the real stuff.\\n\\nI didn't realize that I was in a mood for curry, but there I was, being drawn to the curry page. They have quite a selection of dishes (including the curries), and most are at the single price point of $6.50 for choosing either chicken, pork, beef (and I think tofu, though I don't remember). It's $1 more if you want shrimp, which is always the case.\\n\\nI like it when menus are like this: simple and unfettered. I settled on the Mus Mun Curry, with chicken. I've had this many times before, and at most other places, including in Thailand, it is called by various names as \\"Mussaman\\" or \\"Massaman\\" curry. It's a rich yellow curry with onions, peanuts, and potatoes, which aid in the thickening of the curry sauce. All the curries at Exotic Thai Food come with a mound of white rice.\\n\\nI loved it! It had great flavor, not overly spicy, and the ratio of meat to potatoes to onions was just right. I wish they used white meat instead of the dark meat, but that's a minor quibble. I am surprised, though, that the rice was a bit overcooked and mushy. That was slightly disappointing, but then again, I buried most of my rice with the rich curry sauce, so in a way, that made up for it. It made me think, though, that if their white steamed rice was this overcooked and mushy, I wonder how the fried rice dishes would turn out.\\n\\nOverall, an okay dining experience. Since it's way up north, it will not be a regular thing for me, but if I'm ever in the area, I would definitely give them a try again. They had many other entr√©es that are worth a try. Their prices are definitely a bargain."},{"name":"Sal's Ristorante & Pizzeria","address":"205 L St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Fake Italian food.

The rice and beans is steamed with coconut milk, and has a delightful cinnamon flavor; it goes perfectly with all of the delicious dishes they offer. While the staff are definitely slow-moving and laid-back, the service, generally speaking, is fine. On occasion, it has even been very pleasant. When I first started eating here, I was unsure about what I could safely eat as a vegetarian; the woman who often works behind the counter was very helpful and kind, and pointed me in the right direction. Savory cabbage, tasty fried plantains, syrupy sweet potatoes, and crisp mixed veggies...everything I've tried here was great. Even their hot sauce is good. And the quantity of food they give you is downright insane.\\n\\nThe reason this place is only getting three stars is because they are consistently out of a large portion of their menu items. How I wish it weren't so! While I always enjoyed my food here, I pretty much stopped going. It was just too much of an inconvenience to go there, only to leave empty-handed. Since I don't eat meat, I know my options are more limited (though the menu does have many veggie offerings), but the fact that Flames is constantly out of popular items, like plantains and sweet potatoes, is frustrating and avoidable.\\n\\nIf the menu was more reliable, Flames would truly be a fantastic establishment. I would highly recommend stopping by if you're in the neighborhood, or don't mind settling for something other than what you came in for.

She was rude and nasty to all staff members openly through our entire meal. It wasn't very busy so we wanted to stay and have coffees and pie after our meal, but her attitude pretty much soured the entire place for us. On another visit, she sat us at a table right by the door on a blustery cold day. When I asked her if we could move away from the door, she got pretty huffy with us.

I can't believe I waited so long. It was fantastic. The service was stellar. The food spectacular and the atmosphere was on point. We shared the Meat Mezza and a bowl of Lentil soup. More than enough food for 2 @ $11 a pop including tip, Drinks will run you extra but isn't that always the case? I was blown away by this quiet unobtrusive little downtown spot.

I was excited to see them as they are one of my favorite bands. I bought 4 tickets to have a great evening with my wife and brother and his wife. We decided to dine there. \\nWe arrived 10 mins before the doors opened. You are not allowed to sit yourself in your seats so after checking us in we were ushered to our table (you can see the tables I chose in the here https://imgur.com/a/hx9QF , this screenshot was taken when I ordered the tickets about a month ago). We ordered a couple drinks and about 3 appetizers. The food was alright but we were excited for the show most of all. We ordered our entrees and after sitting at our table for over an hour the show started and our entrees arrived. We all started eating when we noticed 4 people arriving late in the middle of the show (husband,wife, 2 young teenagers). The usher had them hover for a bit around our table and then approached us. \\" You are in the wrong seats.\\" She said to us as we had our mouth full and were enjoying the show. We politely said that these were the seats we bought and that we were ushered to these seats. She replied saying that even though we were sat at this table we were in the wrong seats and that she needed us to move. This conversation was not started with a \\" Excuse me but we made a mistake seating you, I'm sorry but would you mind moving to this other table\\" This conversation was started as if we were at fault for sitting in the wrong seats. My brother pulled up the screen shot that I took of our seats when I ordered the tickets and we 100% were sitting in the middle of the table 1 table in from stage left. He showed it to the usher, mind you this is all going on in the middle of the show while our food is getting cold. She replied with \\" I know those are the seats you chose but those seats are at that table\\" ( pointing to the third table from the wall in the screenshot. My brother pointed out by counting the tables in the room and showing the screenshot that we are sitting in the correct seat. She told us that we were in the wrong seats and that the table my brother was pointing at was \\"imaginary\\". Still no apology. They then proceeded to move us and all of our food and drinks in the middle of the show to this other table. Why could they not sit that table of 4 in the seats that were clearly not occupied by 4 people half through a meal. It seems to me that because it was a sold out show they overbooked it and possibly added another table in the spot we were supposed to be. \\nAfter we were moved we couldn't focus on the show. We were not in the right mood. My wife's silverware wasn't replaced and the condiments she requested were not brought out. We had to share a napkin. We had an order of fries that never showed up after being moved. On top of that it seemed we were an after thought now as even with our card up saying we needed help, no one came by anymore. I got up in the middle of the show to look for someone to give me some help but decided to walk out to the front desk to see what seating chart they had on their iPad to compare and also see if I could talk to management. I brought up my situation to the woman and said that we needed assistance and that we were moved from our table and now we are unable to enjoy the show because we are waiting on trying to get a server and silverware. There was a man standing right next to me. He was busy looking at something the whole time I was explaining my situation and frustration and only when the front desk woman said I could speak to a manager did she chime in saying he was a manager. I explained again and he said to go back to the table and enjoy the evening and that he would be right over to help and get me what I needed. Still no apology. \\nI went back to the table but our minds were still consumed by what just happened. It took another 10 mins for a waitress to show up and get us another round of drinks but we didn't get another napkin roll. My food was cold when I got back and I didn't see this manager I spoke to until 25 minutes later and he just cleared my plate. I never saw him again. My brother also went to speak with a manager but he said he didn't talk to the same one I described. My brother's experience was that it was more our fault that this happened and still no apology. \\nThe show ended and the waitress came to our table and told us that they comped one round of drinks and took $40 dollars off the meal and gave us 4 tickets to any show we wanted. That is all fine and dandy but that isn't what we wanted. We wanted to make sure that no one else has this sort of experience and we wanted to speak to someone about what went wrong. Still never saw that \\"manager\\". Why do I want 4 tickets to a venue where I might be given the right seat? Checked our receipt and we were given someone else's bill. I will not come back here. That 4 that replaced us? Ordered waters and no dinner.

Flat out, this place is a great beer garden with gourmet sausages ranging from flavors like rabbit, boar, and duck. I think the unique part was having these sausages served on this metal stand. They take their time grilling these up and making sure every topping is distributed properly. \\n\\nIt's a bit pricey from about $10-$12 a sausage which is by far the most priciest I've had so far from a gourmet sausage joint. They have lots of beer on tap to go along with your meal. I recommend sitting right at the bar and having that true Bangers experience. \\n\\nI thought their rabbit & mushroom was delicious. The manchego cheese provided a slight saltiness flavor along with bacon fat. The garlic also provided some flavor to compliment everything. For my beer, I ordered Austin's very own, Independence stash which is a IPA. It's pretty hoppy and will make you feel full. It's light and refreshing but does pack a heavy load. A sausage & beer will run about $18 which to me is expensive but is still a great place to go to.

Some reviews complain about the size of the chicken pieces, not us the smallest pieces have a tendency to be moister and tenderer...big is not always better.

It's a cool space and convenient for us. Unfortunately, there were so many misses with this meal that I left very disappointed. The server was delightful and attentive, but everything else missed the mark. To start, we had to sit outside because there was loud music playing inside--and I'm not talking about my grandmother's version of loud music--I'm talking about dance club loud music, making it absolutely impossible to hear anything. I asked the hostess about it and she informed us that the upstairs was rented out for a party. Sorry, but that's pretty ridiculous. If you are going to rent out part of the restaurant and keep the rest open to other customers, you can't have music so loud that no one else is happy. The hostess said that the person who rented out the upstairs rents it out every month. Weird. So anyway, we sat outside which was not ideal but ok (the music was still loud outside but not ear-crushing like inside). The patio was actually quite nice and our server was great. The food was hit or miss. Some dishes were killer and others were really off. There were four of us and we shared dishes. Generally speaking, the veggie dishes were awesome, whereas the fish and meat dishes weren't cooked properly. My cocktail took about ten minutes to arrive. My partner's arrived right away, so that was weird too. There are some really great things about this place but it is very uneven, plus, they really need to decide what they want to be.

Each one has its own vibe. This one has low ceilings, a wider more open seating area, a bigger bar, and decent sized patio with a classy freestanding outdoor fireplace. The decor is similar to the other locations but the vibe is different. This is more of an after work happy hour gathering spot that being said the low ceilings make sound bounce everywhere so it gets loud happy buzz of chatter quick. The late night happy hour isn't at this location however they do have artists play music in the evenings. The food and drinks are consistent otherwise. I personally love Tuesday  $1 burger night.

Our server was soooo attentive and skilled that he came from nowhere and gently assured the patron that he would get him another chair, thus not disturbing us. WOW so well mannered and classy.  That is Ultimate in service.  I think the servers here view their job as a profession and it truly is a pleasure for them to serve at least that's how we felt.

It was the perfect choice and everyone had a great time - including the adults.  Service was great; staff was funny and attentive. The DJ (Robert) was fantastic and really made an effort to call out all special occasions and make everyone feel special. The dance floor was packed from the moment he opened it up and the girls never sat down - except  to grab some dinner. The food was very good. I have a catering background so I appreciate what it takes to serve good food in a confined space. Everything tasted fresh and hot - we all loved the mashed potatoes! There was a nice variety and I felt like there was something for all tastes. The dessert was another story. Very weird cheesecake and something that resembled chocolate mousse. They should stick to cookies and brownies, which they distributed as we disembarked at the end of the cruise. That was literally the only slightly negative element to the entire evening.\\n\\nI highly recommend the Spirit of Boston. We had a private table, perhaps because the boat wasn't overly crowded. The cost was extremely reasonable, especially considering that I got the tickets via Groupon. I've seen comments that drinks are expensive, but I didn't find them anymore than you'd find at any decent restaurant or pub.

Very simple taste but good. The ale cheese adds a slightly bitter taste, as does the spinach, but the sweet onions compliment that and also give additional texture and crunch.

I was fortunate to find the The Original Dinerant, a perky hipster little diner that I thought would be great for dinner. Unfortunately, I don't think this place met my expectations.\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the restaurant, I was immediately seated at the bar without any other options (I realized later that other people were being seated at normal booths - which is what I would've preferred way more). The server at the bar was not attentive at all and I waited a good while to order. Meanwhile, another server was chatting up a storm with the patron beside me. I asked if she would be able to put in my order and she told me, \\"sorry, I'm not your server you would need to talk to him instead\\". I basically had to go right up to the server to get him to take my order.\\n\\nFinally able to order, I decided to get the Squealer burger which consisted of a bacon beef patty, fried egg, red onions, lettuce, tomato and chipotle aioli. Alright, sounds good now. When the food finally came, I found my patty to be a bit red and undercooked and the portion to be a bit small for $15 bucks. Taste wise, I did think the burger was pretty decent, the fried egg was a bit of a funky touch but I didn't think it was worth all the raves that this place got online.\\n\\nAs I was getting ready to leave, I tried to call for my check, but the bar server had literally dissapeared for 20 mins and was nowhere to be found. I tried waving over someone else from the otherside but they just looked at me and said that the bar was not her responsibility and she wouldn't get my bill. I told her that I had a train to catch and she said that she would try to find him. Another 10 minutes later he finally appeared and I was finally able to pay and leave. Never again. \\n\\nOverall, 2.5 stars. The food is alright, somewhat novel but kinda overpriced.

The clam chowder is piping hot and an interesting fushion of a New England fav with Japanese influences of miso and Asian veggies.  What makes Oga unique is definitely their offerings of Japanese cuisine.

I love the Salmon kinutamaki which uses pickled radish as a wrapper rather than nori.  It's amazingly fresh, tightly rolled, and delectable.  The Sake-Chazuke (Salmon traditional rice soup) is a great deal ($6.75) and very light.  It has a delicate flavor spiked with a bit of wasabi.  \\n\\nBasically, don't stick to what you know because Oga's has so much to offer apart from your standard sushi fare found in most sushi places.\\n\\nThe prices are what you would expect but can be VERY reasonable if you decide make a meal of appetizers (the best option expecially if you want to try alot).  Great date place too.  \\n\\nThe decor is very contemporary with Japanese influences - bamboo, zen gardens, and low lighting.  The host is a sharply dressed man who always dons a gracious attitude.

The rolls that came with cream mushroom soup - warm, crispy, tasted like right out of the oven. For entrees we had Pork Dijonnaise (special of the day) and Medallion Beef. The beef was so tender and well paired with mushroom sauce. The dijonnaise on pork was surprisingly not too salty and tasted like hearty French country cooking. Chocolate mousse and cheescake concluded our lunch - I liked their cheescake for its lightness and whipped cheese filling. Will definitely go back for lunch."},{"name":"Newport Seafood Grill Broadway","address":"1200 NE Broadway, Ste 10","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"So I know that this place (which used to be Newport Bay), is one of those franchise places that I typically avoid, but the happy hour here is fantastic!

It is a very hip space located in the heart of Atlanta's trendiest place, Buckhead. I came early for my reservation, and told to wait on the lounge/bar area. Right away me and my BF were served with water and give nthe menu. Not long after my friend came, they usher us to our seats and our waitress introduced herself. Everything was very efficient but I didn't feel rushed at all. I love it. \\n\\nWe each ordered 2 plates of food. I ordered and appetizer (the lemon drenched snapper that I don't remember the name) which was good, but too lemony. My other order was anago, but they ran out of it, so I asked for unagi instead. I didn't try the unagi (because they only gave 3 pieces), but my friend said it's really good. \\n\\nThe rest of the food were 3 rolls ,soft shelled crab, rainbow, and a tuna topped roll. Everything was good, but rolls are just rolls for me. Then there was the hotate sashimi (I'm dying to eat more). It's a huge scallop, very refreshing with slice of lime, and very tender it almost melt in your mouth. The other one was, of course we have to order this, the Ootoro. People didn't lie when they said it literally melt on your tongue. Next time I'll make sure to try all maguro, chutoro and ootoro together to taste the difference.  Lastly we ordered the black cod misoyaki. This one was the bomb! We were so amazed at how soft and delicious every part of the fish was. \\n\\nOur server also told us about the green tea souffle beforehand (it took 20 min to serve them I believe) and when it came we were blown away, but this time in a peaceful way. I feel like I'm going to be labeled as crazy here but here we go. When you dip you spoon to the souffle it was soft and I was giggling a bit (sake effect? LOL). Then when I ate the souffle it felt like I'm very satisfied with everything in life hahaha. The green tea wasn't overpowering, it's subtle but strong enough for you to know that it's there. \\n\\nUmi is the place where you want to go back even if its breaking your bank account :)"},{"name":"Marco's Pizza","address":"7414 University Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"The best damn pizza I had in a long time!!!

It's located in that slick new strip mall at the southwest corner of Braker and Lamar with entirely glass store fronts that also houses Pho Danh and a Chinese bank. Another Vietnamese superstore (Hong Duc) is set to open next to Exotic Thai, too. (This alone is exciting for anyone who's visited Houston and walked through its large Asian grocery stores. For Austin to have TWO Vietnamese grocery stores? We've come a long way, baby!)\\n\\nNow, about Exotic Thai. My old high school friend and I chose to eat there for our reunion dinner. We like places with odd names, and considering this one hints at a joint that offers barefoot backwalking rather than legit food, and considering the fact that we were craving Thai grub, this place was the obvious choice. \\n\\nI first noticed not the black granite tabletops or the sparse feel of the place. No, I noticed the yin and yang salt and pepper shakers on the table. That's because I have my own set on my own table at home. Overall, I'm a little baffled by this strip center in general because most local Asian food joints here seem to have a kitschy feel, so the high-end modern-minimalist thing is a bit of shocker.\\n\\nWe chose to go around 4 p.m. on a Sunday -- the first surprise was that they were actually open, as I thought they might close between lunch and dinner every day. Our greeter was also our server and also the cashier, but this wasn't an issue since there were only about four tables occupied. He was super friendly and attentive throughout the meal, which often colors my opinion of whether I'd return. Passing grade on the service card.\\n\\nI ordered my three baseline items that also help determine whether I'll return: Thai iced tea, tom ka soup and pad thai. If you can't get those right, it makes me wonder if you'll get the other stuff wrong. \\n\\nFirst, I was shocked by the prices. Most items were under $10. For Thai eats, that made me want to jump on the fancypants table and do a dance of joy. Second, the food took no time at all to arrive at the table. I wasn't even close to done with my soup by the time our entrees arrived (but I guess that could've been because I was doing a lot of catching up with my bud).\\n\\nRegardless ...\\n\\nThe tea was nummy nummy -- as good as the thumbs-up Thai iced teas I've had elsewhere. The soup was a chicken, mushroom, galanga mix in a spicy coconut milk broth. Muy tasty. Just the right amount of spice to bite your tongue, then disappear by the next slurp. I asked for the chicken pad thai to be a bit spicy. It came out not spicy at all, and I was surprised there was no lime on the side for squeezing. I love my limes, and I almost asked for one, but I tasted a hint of it on the noodles, so I passed this time. \\n\\nPresentation was nice but not overwhelming. I think a large part of the budget was spent on the granite tabletops and sleek lighting -- none of which really matter when you're shoving good eats down your piehole, you know? But back to the food ...\\n\\nThe pad thai was very good. Not the best, but for under $7, it was pretty damn good. I ate most of it (I was hungry!). The plate wasn't heaped overwhelmingly high, but it definitely was more than enough for one person, but not near enough for two. \\n\\nMy friend ordered some spicy chicken noodles (sorry -- can't remember exactly what they were), and he was on fire. The menu noted they were spicy, so I guess they mean business when they put that chili icon next to the menu listing. \\n\\nI fully intend to return to this place again and again.

It was slightly charred and seasoned well. If I was solely judging that one item, it would have been about 4.5 stars.

I had the apple French toast with boar sausage. The sausage was awesome. Very flavorful. The French toast was a little too sweet in my opinion, but that's purely a matter of preference so I won't fault them for that. The problem was that the bread was dry in some places, like it hadn't been dipped fully or allowed to absorb the batter. \\n\\nI wouldn't rule out a 3rd visit.

It took quite a while for the food to come. I wasn't too impressed by the food to be honest. It was all luke warm. The fried chicken was a fried chicken sausage (not surprising since they are a sausage place). It was way too over battered and had a strange taste to me. The biscuit was my favorite place it was very tasty and buttery. The mashed potatoes were okay. The boudin was alright, also not the best boudin I have enjoyed. The red beans and rice were very spicy though, so beware. \\n\\nIt gets pretty hot if you are in a sunny spot. So I recommend sunglasses for the outdoor experience. There are some seats that are under a covering, but I wouldn't really count on that. We rode our motorcycles here so it was fairly easier to find a parking spot, but not as easy as one would think. I'm not sure as to the parking situation for cars, you may have a small walk if you decide to come on a weekend in a car. \\n\\nAfter the wait and the food experience I would really recommend it unless the person is a sausage lover.

My favourite parts of this meal were the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Smoke Chicken Leg. The Pulled Pork comes in a very easy-to-hold bread shell and the sauce is incredibly juicy and flavourful. The Smoke Chicken Leg had this unique seasoning on top to give it a smoky taste and the chicken was perfectly barbequed all the way through. This is a pretty hard task and they nailed it. My least favourite part goes to the St. Louis Pork Ribs. The seasoning here was similar to the chicken leg but there was a little too much seasoning on top. The end result was a very dry tasting pork rib that required large amounts of dipping to chew it down. The deep fried dill pickles were an interesting touch, and extremely hot on the inside. I feel the cornbread and hush puppies exist solely to make you feel completely stuffed. They're warm on the inside and chock full of calories to get you to a food coma as fast as possible.¬†\\n\\nCompared to Memphis Blues, the variety here is much better.

Waited half an hour to get seated, had our server throw our menus and silverware on the table without introducing himself, and just ask what we wanted.\\n\\nOur food came out and it was incredibly average, and even sub par.

They're fist-sized dumplings of meat, kraut, and cheese, breaded and fried and absolutely to die for with a side of spicy red cabbage. \\nI'm also a big fan of their events, like the special holiday market and the local microbrew tasting. \\nIts always a blast here!"},{"name":"Gustav's Pub & Grill","address":"10350 SW Greenburg Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The fondue is tasty, as were the $7 cocktails with names like \\"Pink Maddog\\". \\n\\nHappy hour menu with a wide range of good cheap appetizers. No drink specials or at least \\"none that I know of\\" (come on, a hostess doesn't need to really know everything, does she?)\\n\\nOur table area was filthy and I had to scoot a bunch of them together myself.  At which point I asked that some please rolly-vac the mounds of filth and partially chewed food on the floor. \\n\\nI think it could have been a 3 star experience if the entire staff didn't seem so completely baffled (put out?) by serving my group of about 15 students who trickled in over the course of an hour or two during happy hour. Maybe I expect too much, but the place was hardly full.  Isn't that what happy hour  is FOR? To get lots of people to drop in and have drinks?\\n\\nAt one point, I was choking on a piece of bread and my friend asked the bartender for something hot for me to drink to try and get the bread down. She told him to go find our server for that. I literally did not have a hot drink for 20 minutes.  I still keep asking him, \\"Really? And you were clear on the choking part?  REALLY? No seriously. You told her I was choking. No.....\\" \\n\\nThe people that work there come across as disingenuous and resentful of their chosen profession, venue, possibly both.

It was 8:30pm. Nobody was in the restaurant. 2 tables of people  were eating outside. Our waitress never asked how  anything was, never told us why we were waiting so long, and never one asked if our drinks or food were ok.  One busboy spend the whole time we were there banging the china plates, setting and unsetting the tables. The music was way too loud for a \\"cozy\\" restaurant. The food was hot, but almost too hot. Microwaved? I could go on and on, but it's just not worth it. We love using Groupon and restaurant.com.

I've eaten a lot of gyros, and taste wise many are very similar. But they package their gyro into a very filling but still manageable package. So rather than losing all the goods while trying to eat it (or having to resort to a knife and fork) you can actually easily eat this while walking around. \\n\\nThe people that work here were REALLY friendly too.
