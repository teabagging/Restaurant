Was it great? It WAS! Was it as phenomenal as its reputation that preceded it? No, not even close.\\n\\nFirst of all, this place is adorable: super funky, with a golden-flecked brick exterior and eclectic, wacky interior fittings (i.e., a humongous, inverted donut suspended from the ceiling and tons of pink, everywhere). The store is small and the line to get in is long but it moves along so no complaints from us patrons a-waiting. The aroma of the donuts wafting in the air is intoxicating. \\n\\nOh, I should note, for those of you reading this who aren't familiar with Portland or this area (as we weren't), that there is no designated parking lot here. There is ample parking on the street but it's all paid meter parking, and there are a few parking lots in the vicinity but you have to pay for them as well. So be prepared for that.\\n\\nI should also note that this place accepts cash ONLY. My kid and I only found out about this after waiting in line and finally getting into the store and seeing the posted sign on by the door. I scrambled to find $15 in bills and coins in my wallet (usually I pay for everything via debit card and rarely do I have any cash on me). My bad for not checking out the details of this place prior to visiting.\\n\\nAfter paying a few bucks for parking, I raided my coffee fund pouch for quarters and $1 bills and came up with enough cash for the \\"VooDoo Dozen\\": for $15, the counter staff will randomly choose a dozen donuts (there are a few exceptions. You won't get the voodoo man donut or a few other selective types). I must say, I was pleased that, despite their famous reputation, they don't charge an arm and a leg for their goods, as most places do when their brand name gets hyped up enough. Their prices per donut and per dozen were reasonable, and that surprised me - in a good way.\\n\\nThe counter gal who helped us was pleasant and all the folks who worked here were very efficient (which accounts for the quick-moving line of customers). \\n\\nNow, getting to the meat of this review: the actual donuts themselves. They were fresh. They were good. Super good! Wonderful flavors. Many creative concoctions, too; we were commenting on how the staff here must have a blast in thinking of new and wacky flavors. Some donuts were big. A few were filled. Some were smaller and denser. One had mini-M&M's on them. One had multicolored sprinkles. One had Cap'n Crunch cereal. I think one had hibiscus flavored icing. For the most part, though, I have no idea what types of donuts I got in my dozen. All I know is, they were all delicious and my family has already devoured half of them. For my part, I think Krispy Kreme and Top Pot donuts are just as good, just without the wacky or creative flavors, and without the funky and unique sole brick and mortar shop. But what do I know; I'm no donut aficionado. lol!\\n\\nThere are benches in the adjacent alleyway by the shop to dine on your newly-purchased donuts.

It was like a churro dipped in maple frosting.\\n\\nThe vegan cocknballs was good.  Its cool that the vegan donut was pretty close to a normal donut, just a little dense and dry.  But if I didn't know, I would just think it was a dry donut.  The cream inside the balls is delicious.  Get the normal cocknballs if you arent vegan.\\n\\nThe portland cream was my favorite.

Honestly, the wait built up the anticipation of the dinner, so it was also part of the experience. The ramen was delicious. The broth was thick and flavorful. I had the traditional Shio ramen and sampled bites from the miso-sesame ramen too. My favorite was the traditional, but I did like the sesame flavor as well. Another highlight was the soft-cooked eggs that come as a side dish. Our eggs were perfectly cooked with just a little bit of runniness. One more thing to note is that it would be hard to go here with a group bigger than four. You have to wait till a table opens up, and most of the tables fit 2 people or groups of 6, but to get a table of 6, you'd have to wait for everyone to leave, which could take a while!"},{"name":"Elsi's Restaurant","address":"6601 Burnet Rd, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"At these prices, I can't complain!\\n\\nWent with my bother, his girlfriend and her roommate for a late breakfast this morning.

The deal was for 2 \\"Fancypants\\" burgers, fries, an appetizer, a flight of 3 craft beers, a fried Moonpie and a boozy milkshake. Here's the breakdown:\\n-burger: fried egg, herbed cream cheese, bacon and mixed greens. This was not a good burger. The burger patty was tasteless and so were the toppings. I wonder why...oh yeah, it was because of the disgusting giant, stale bun they put it all on.\\n-fries: the fries reminded me of what you end up with when you buy fast food fries and then let them sit in the bag for 20 minutes before eating them.\\n-app: fried pimento cheese balls; these would have been good had they actually been warm. WTF was going on in the kitchen? It was 7:30 p and crowded, why wasn't the food fresh and hot?\\n-beer flight: the only thing they didn't prepare was actually good.\\n-fried Moonpie: Moonpies aren't good to begin with, so this isn't Grindhouse's fault.\\n-milkshake: had the banana/chocolate/peanut butter one. It was good, unfortunately we ordered them, waited 15 minutes, went back to the bar to check on where they were, confusion ensued, waited another 10 minutes for the bartender to bring them over and tell us she accidentally misplaced the order - honest mistake, but it just added to the overall bad experience.\\nSo maybe it was an off night. The place was crowded and it's been around for awhile, so it can't be that bad, right? I see the other Yelp reviews and they tend to be pretty positive. Perhaps I had an atypical Grindhouse experience. Well, too bad. There are plenty of other burger places in town where I haven't had a bad meal, so Grindhouse, you're out forever.\\nOh yeah, typical order at the counter type of burger place, or you can sit at the bar for full service.

It was a very busy day.\\n\\nStaff is very friendly and attentive. They make sure what allergies you may have so that they can inform you what meals you can eat. Quick service and when they clean your plates for the next meal, they make sure the table is clean. They literally pick up every piece of crumb up. \\n\\nI went with a few friends and did a 3 course meal, I believe it was the christmas meal? Not sure. But the appetizers were so good! Each person received a lobster ravioli, a pizza to share, and also some home smoked salmon with some delicious sauce. We then moved onto the main course: choice of salmon, short ribs with lump crab, and venision (deer). Went for the short ribs, and oh, it was tender and the lump crab just made the dish oh so delicious. I did find after a while of eating, the meal was a bit salty. It was ok after I sipped a bit of water though. For dessert, I don't know the name, but you get this white chocolate cone decorated to look like a tree that is filled with chocolate mousse, topped on a small chocolate cake that have rum flavored cherries.

A friend and I recently had dinner here and as we don't get together all that often, we tend to chat it up and visit a while when we're out for dinner. We arrived at 6 and were seated immediately; we ordered some beverages and then set about visiting. We ordered our dinner at 6:25; neither of us wanted any appetizers. From that point, it took approximately 50 minutes to finally receive our meals. I was floating in iced tea refills and my friend was on his second basket of rather dry bread by that time. (I don't eat bread, so can only take his word on that.) I will say that my steak tips had a very good flavor, but I did feel that it was more of a lunch portion size - and because they weren't very uniform in size, some pieces were positively charred crunchy, while a few pieces were properly cooked; none very warm. (I had requested they be cooked to 'Medium'.) Since I was starving by the time we got our food I'd have eaten shoe leather, so I ate the charred pieces anyway and didn't complain. My asparagus was also rather overdone - several pieces were charred and many of the ends were as tough as sugar cane and so stringy that my steak knife wouldn't cut through them so I just cut what I could and left what I couldn't. I certainly can't fault my server, Lizzie, because she was amazing and so professional and pleasant that I didn't have the heart to bitch about my meal. It's not her fault. SHE really was the best part of the evening. And I wouldn't be bitching about my meal even now if it wasn't for what transpired during the rest of our visit. It was raining pretty hard, and people were arriving in droves. As this place is very small, there isn't anywhere for people to wait for tables to free up so the guests are left to push their way in and belly up 3 and 4 deep at the bar which means that the bar flies are literally hanging out at YOUR table if you happen to be seated at any of the high-tops at the center of the room. One guy actually placed his hand on our table beside my elbow to lean while he loudly talked to his friends in my ear and at one point he actually started to put his used cocktail glass down but I guess he thought better of that. People in VERY wet coats were allowed to crowd in, between the dining tables, and one guy actually leaned back onto my friend while wearing his soaking wet coat. Can I fault the restaurant for that? Yes, I think I can. I'm pretty sure the place was well over their allowed capacity, so maybe the host or hostess, at some point, should have advised people at the door, 'Sorry, we're fully booked tonight... Come again?' You know, if I go to a bar that maybe just serves pub grub, I expect a bar atmosphere and loud bar crowd, and a certain amount of camaraderie and jostling. But this place advertises itself on hospitality and fine food. That's NOT what it is. It's really just a bar. But that brings me to the advertised \\"hospitality\\". Having waited for so long for the kitchen to get it together enough to deliver our dinner, we took maybe a half hour to eat our meals. The WHOLE TIME, the older woman at the host station kept staring quite hostilely at us and at our plates gauging how quickly she might be able to turn over our table. As we had chosen this place to dine, but ALSO to listen to the live music that had been advertised, I thought that was VERY rude. She had an attitude of 'Hurry up, eat and get out!' After dinner, I ordered a cup of tea. While I drank my tea and waited for the music to cue up, she & several guests were literally preying on our table... standing beside the table and staring at us and talking about the table being theirs next, etc.. We hadn't even gotten, let alone eaten dessert yet! My friend had ordered a chocolate dessert that we were advised takes 15 minutes to prepare - we were waiting for that to arrive. When it finally came, that woman at the host stand came over before he finished his last bite and tried to take his plate away. That's very rude. So here's the deal. The kitchen needs to get it together. This was my second experience here and there hasn't been any  improvement in getting food out of the kitchen in a timely manner. And I think the place needs to convert to strictly pub grub and alcohol and forget about fine dining. Because it's really just a bar... And when you decide to add live music that takes up the space that holds 3 or more tables, you need to understand that you're not going to be able to seat as many people for dinner - and that people are going to want to linger at their tables to enjoy the music. You can't stand like a vulture (as the woman hostess did) ogling customers with hostility and trying to take their plates away before they're finished. I've been twice... and while I like the decor and the food has decent flavor, the kitchen is way too slow and the place is way too small and crowded to be able to call it a nice 'dining' experience. I might try one more time - but only for lunch."},{"name":"Grill On the Go","address":"10175 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So so good, great price.

My friend made his order ask her what flavor shrimp do they have an she flips the menu and pointed instead of suggesting or informing us about the different flavor or whatever. We order and that was that then we were trying to find her to make another order and she was nowhere to be found and when she saw me waving at her she made the gesture of acknowledgement, but she didn't come right away she was on the same side of the previous table and was walking back and forth \\" lost\\".

The tofu was excellent, and it came with shredded carrot and beet, along with the usual bonito flakes, which made for a lovely presentation. the tuna was also excellent, and while the presentation for this was also attractive, I personally didn't care for the blueberries with my tuna. I do tend to eat my garnish! The Gomae roll was Ok, but I wouldn't order it again, although I do love Gomae in just its usual form. I personally didn't care for it wrapped in a roll, with just a tiny dab of the sesame sauce on top rather than throughout the spinach. A bit dry. For me it's not a big deal as there are loads of other things I would happily eat, but if I were a vegetarian, I would be disappointed.\\n\\nThe service was attentive and friendly, and  we were checked on regularly to see if we needed more drinks, and the restaurant itself was clean. The music was horrendous, but I almost expect that generally speaking, especially on a Friday night. The prices were pretty decent.

The food is still really good. The service though, has become inconsistent and dare I say a bit on the sloppy side.   We went for dinner on Friday evening, and the same thing happened that occurred the last time. All, or almost all, of one person's food coming before the other one of us got a single item or just got one, while the other has all their food, and then one thing coming at the very end for the person who has already been waiting as the other eats. We had both completely finished our food, and at that point  just want the bill without ever getting that last item...which happened to be the biggest thing I ordered. The first time this happened, I asked about it once, then again stating to just take it off the bill as we were ready to go. Seconds later, it arrived. This time, I  didn't bother asking. I just waited to see what would happen if I didn't ask. Same thing. It came when we were ready to leave. I don't know what's going on  - whether it's a communication issue between the kitchen and servers, or what, but I hope they get it sorted out. We both agreed that would be our last visit for awhile.

The veal with string beans, or dou zai niu zai gu is always good.  The meat is marinated and covered in a thin layer of corn starch, which keeps it from drying out.  I'm not sure what cut of meat they use, but this cornstarch stir fry technique produces some of most melt in your mouth beef you will ever taste.  The downside to it though, is that the cornstarch will muck up the sauce and make it very thick.  The beef in this dish is beautifully tender at Victoria's, as tender as I've had it at any restaurant, and the sauce is only a tiny bit over starched.  This dish is always a mainstay for me at Chinese restaurants and Victoria's is one of the best places to get it.\\n\\nAll of their salt pepper fried dishes are good.  Their salt pepper squid is among the best I've ever had.  You don't really get the sense that it is fried in a batter.  A doughy outside ruins salt pepper squid, and plus the flavor is great.  Salt pepper pork is equally good, but I would not whole heartedly recommend the salt pepper fish chunks.  The fish may not be the very freshest (it's not made from the guys in the tanks) and it's got a smattering of batter on the outside.\\n\\nMy mother often complains about their steamed fish.  \\"It's overdone\\" she says, and she's right.  I find the tilapia she steams at home to be more tender and better.  Jumbo Seafood and Peach Farm, and probably several other Chinatown restaurants do better steamed fishes, but I wouldn't say it's bad at Victoria's.  It's a little overcooked, but you can take solace in the fact that the fish was kicking only moments ago.  A lot of people complain about how gunky and greasy Chinese or maybe more specifically Cantonese food is (I am often one of those people) and to them, I would recommend the soy sauce chicken and the steamed fish.\\n\\nAnother dish I usually enjoy is the cold, piclked jellyfish, always paired with pickled radishes, and you can throw in pork cold cuts or spicy duck's feet.  The pork cold cuts fill me up a little too much for an appetizer (they are great, but not the kind of thing that goes with rice) so I end up getting the duck's feet.  They skin it for you, so that you don't have to futse with the bones.\\n\\nI somehow wind up getting the Lobster almost every time I come here, even though I don't enjoy corn starchy stir fried lobster (blasphemy?!).  I usually take a few bites, and it's about as good as it is in any Chinatown restaurant."},{"name":"Popeyes","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Three piece tenders, dirty rice, biscuit and Mardi Gras mustard right before I boarded my flight to Seattle.

The infamous chicken sandwich is the best thing I've had on the menu.

The huevos rancheros is also pretty good for breakfast. Bottom line,  if you're looking for a change of scenery,  it's a good option.

I've had a lot of comments that \\"it isn't even the best donut shop\\" - here's the thing - you probably aren't going to Voodoo for the best donuts (though they're VERY good). You go for the experience of Voodoo. It's a classic Portland move. Especially if you're a tourist.\\n\\nI'm not huge on donuts - I will never choose to get a donut unless someone else takes me. But - during my visit to Portland it was a must. I rarely also finish a donut, but this was actually so tasty! I got the Voodoo doll donut, because I felt it was the most representative donut. The shop it cool because they have a display of all of their donuts - you just point to the one you want, and they'll grab you a fresh one from the back. \\n\\nThe line is deceiving - things move very fast here because 1) it's cash only 2) the shop is small, so there's not much standing room there - therefore, there is always a line outside 3) their system is very efficient!

At counter to order, was very helpful giving us 1st timers (told her that) the menu rundown. Spent time explaining ingredients & recommendations to us.  When I said no onions on my meal, she asked what about onions in the salsa...that's when I found out they would make it fresh to order which I will discuss later.

Fresh Salsa made with avocado, tomatoes, cilantro, etc. and made without onions at my request with thick crunchy chips.  Add sauces on table to your liking if desired, heated ours up.  Beef burrito was pulled beef (not ground!) that was very well cooked with added tomatoes, etc. and wrapped in a fresh made tortilla. Plate presentation was excellent with sour cream, cheese, etc (see photo).  Wife thought both her chicken and pork tacos were excellent but preferred pork overall.  Prices were great and meals fresh\\n\\nEnvironment:  4 stars-  Yes its a small place but don't despise small beginnings.  For a small place works well with simple decor.

I chose to give it a 4/5 for the following reasons.\\n\\nFood: I ordered the turkey dish with a side of raspberry sauce. I absolutely loved this dish. Although it is a perfect amount for me, it can be considered \\"appetizer\\" amount for other people. I don't recommend getting the salmon dish for people who are super hungry too. The first thing I noticed when I received my dish was that my food was on top of a plate-sized slab of rock lol. It definitely would look good in pictures xD. The most important part, though, is the flavor. They put a copious amount of turkey on bread with a mini scoop of raspberry sauce on top of it. The bread is really moist and complements the turkey very well. On the side was a few leaves of salad (lol) and a slice of cantaloupe for the very end. Overall, I felt full and this was a very nice and casual dish to order. \\n\\nService: So here is the prime reason why I am rating it a 4/5. The majority of my visit consisted of waiting. I had to wait 30 minutes to get a spot for 5 people on a Saturday around 1PM, which is understandable. BUT, after ordering the food right when we sat down, we waited about 50 minutes for the food to come out. Obviously, this wasn't cool... I'm usually patient with food, but 50 minutes isn't the way to go. The food is very simple and all they had to do was get a rock plate, put 5 slices of bread on it with turkey on top and done! But no, it took 50 minutes for that to happen.\\n\\nBuilding: Since this is a cute little French bistro type place, I didn't expect much. It practically looks like/could be someone's house. But their ladies bathroom had no doorknob inside! My friend almost locked herself in:(. Also I don't think the AC was on. My friends and I noted that the place was a bit warm (which wasn't refreshing in the hot Austin heat)\\n\\nOverall, I do recommend y'all to come here for a casual lunch date with some friends or a significant other.

I made reservations two weeks ahead of time for 5 people at 8:30pm. Because they were booked up for most of the night, that was the earliest dinner reservation available. We arrived on time and checked in, but were not seated for 45 minutes and didn't receive our food until another hour of sitting. Everyone kept promising little \\"treats\\" for being so patient and apologized but we got a round of hors d'oeuvres (a single bite of potato with a shrimp on top) after being in the restaurant for an hour and a half. We only got our food after telling the waiter we were about to walk out of the restaurant. Our food came out finally and it was good, great quality even, but the horrendous service overshadowed the food. We ordered one round of food and were planning on another because the portions are so small but after waiting, we just wanted to leave. We got little shortbread cookies as another \\"treat\\" and they took some tapas off of our bill but those gestures did not match the errors made at every level of service. We had so much patience and would have been appeased if when we had sat, we had been offered a free appetizer or drinks on the house but no. The manager should have been checking on us to make sure that after waiting 45 minutes to be seated, we were given prompt and good service. What is sad is that I was so excited to eat here and heard great reviews but the service was awful. You would think that a restaurant so popular would know how to appease their guests. They could have made it up to us but they just kept taking us for granted and people who came in after us, with bigger parties, were seated and fed multiple courses and left before us. Ridiculous."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Phenomenal food and wine, beautiful ambiance and relaxing live music.

Overall, we were disappointed in the level of service and overall quality of the food. Here's the good: they honored our request for a booth as we were celebrating my birthday. It was disappointing that, although we noted that it was my actual birthday in OpenTable, the sever (Ally) made no mention of it. Not that I expect anything (I can afford to pay my bill), but in past years, they have at least brought a glass of champagne or something - or at least said \\"happy birthday\\". \\n\\nHere is where they fell short: the bread we so much enjoyed last year (Chapas) was soggy - so we asked if we could get a loaf that had some crunch (like it was when we first tasted it - it was phenomenal! - see our previous review) Ally came back and unceremoniously (and without saying a word) dumped a fresh BURNED loaf on our table. The salmon chips were good, as always. We asked to split/share the Kale salad. They did not split it. And there was little to no prosciutto on it, plus it was overdressed. At this point, we decided to count our losses and asked for the check. While we were waiting, Ally very enthusiastically welcomed a 16-top next to us and went on and on about the specials, bantering, and was quite...engaged...while she had hardly said a word to us, a mere 2 top. Based on this experience, it is unlikely we will return given how many superb restaurants there are in ATL.\\n\\nBut as I said, this may have been a one-off for them, and I would certainly recommend trying them out, as our earlier experiences were much better."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I rolled the dice based on the reviews of the antelope heart, and I'm glad I did.

There is plenty of free street parking in the area.  Upon entering we were quickly greeted by a friendly bartender. We had a reservation for the wine making and they had a table all set up for us prior to our arrival. We also saw that they have a food menu so we choose to order food. We tried the antipasto platter which is an assortment of meats and cheeses. I must say the meats were delicious. They truly hit the spot. We also ordered the Italian meat lovers flatbread. When it came out we were shocked with the name flatbread how thick the dough was for this pizza. It was by far more dough than it was meats. The dough overpowered everything.\\n\\nWe then began the fun part of sampling 6 different red wines that they currently had available to choose for wine making. Our group was shockingly able to agree on one wine to make. We settled on the Argentine Malbec. Our server / wine maker (whom also just happened to be the owner) took us over to the wine making area. She had everything ready and she definitely tried to thoroughly explain their process of wine making. Be prepared that basically everything comes in a plastic package already broken down in juice or concentrate form. You are basically just dumping it in one by one all together in a wine making bucket, stirring or folding occasionally. I feel they are dumbing down the wine making process for the masses. \\n\\nOverall the wine making process is a nice experience for a small group to try once, but I would not book to do this again a second time. If I could give 3.5 stars I would. Every employee was extremely friendly and they were very helpful, but the wine making process was slightly too simple for me and the flatbread pizza was the opposite of flat.

They gave my mother a gluten free dish..it kind of looks like large french fries but they were a type of root that they cooked...it wasn't bad.... my mother ordered the duck which was better than what I had, I had their traditional lamb dish..which was OKAYYY, but I've had this dish elsewhere and it was much better (and a lot cheaper).  Her duck dish was fantastic, the duck was juicy, the vegetables were not overcooked, and it was perfectly seasoned.  I had their traditional red wine sangria, it was okay, I've had Cuban sangria and that is a must have, but that was when I took a trip to the Florida Keys.  We both had different desserts....I had this chocolate dessert, it was VERY rich, but wow, it was very good.  there was a cinnamon jello cubes on the side, it included a drizzle of caramel, and on top of the chocolate was small cubes of pineapple which gave it a perfect topping.  My mother had the mango-lemongrass gelato...very interesting combination but it works!  Did I mention that is gluten free?  And because it was mother's day, they gave us these sugary cookies (not gluten free) but they were traditional Peruvian style cookies...I have to admit I could probably eat 10 of those lol.  We had exceptional service, our waitress definitely knew the menu by heart.  I asked her about her hiring process if they only hire people that know Spanish, she said that it helps, but not necessary, however, everyone that works there besides the hostesses know Spanish.  The chefs (there were a bunch of them walking around everywhere) were so polite and sweet, when they passed our table they always asked if we were enjoying everything, even the other waiters came to our table to make sure that we were being taken care of..we definitely had five star service.  i would recommend this restaurant to anyone...the restaurant itself is very quaint.  We sat downstairs, but the top is very open, below it has a very comfortable but classy feel.  The building itself is historic, you may notice a few things...I sure did, but that's simply because I am a history major and it intrigues me :)"},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The price is about half the price as other Brazilian steak houses.

A bit of an annoyance in the States when you're pushing 40, but what can you do? I handed over my national residence ID.

The bean sprouts don't add anything to the dish and get in the way of ever having a mouthful of just delicious, springy noodles.

All of the waiters/waitresses are extremely personable and engaging. They make you feel comfortable and are very patient even when it's busy (which is most of the time). \\n\\nAlthough it is a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, I would recommend it to anyone who visits and/or lives in Austin. This place is friendly to all groups (i.e. families, dates, pets, etc.). It is a casual atmosphere with the choice of indoor and outdoor seating. \\n\\nIn terms of food, I recommend the breakfast plates, which are served all day. Ask the waiters about what is popular and what are classic dishes. Those are good to start out with. My personal favorite dish is the tamale breakfast (sweet potato-based) with tofu scramble. I've tried tofu scramble at over 10 restaurants and Bouldin Creek makes the best.

Pretty good system.\\n\\nThe restaurant isn't huge so space is limited. Reservations are probably a good idea. The atmosphere is very cozy and warm. I went for dinner so the lighting was just the right amount of dim so that you could still can see your food and datelol \\n\\nThe service was great, everyone from the host to the waiters and waitresses. Everyone was very attentive and sweet. \\n\\nSo the food here is mostly Asian fusion. The menu itself didn't have too many options but the options they did have were great so you can't really go wrong. I got the tofu noodles dish and it was huge! The portions are pretty big so bring an empty stomach!! It was delicious and because I'm crazy, I decided to order dessert as well and I got their three layer cheesecake.....it was a monster I tell you. I had never seen such a huge slice of cake in my lifeO_O ahah very good though, but it should definitely be shared unless you're trying to pass out from a food coma, then by all means, go for it ahah\\n\\nOverall, I had a great time and will definitely head back whenever I get the chance.

It's a cozy little spot with a nice bar and a tiny kitchen. Like every other reviewer has stated, it takes a long time to get your food here because of the small kitchen, but the food they crank out is awesome. I'd give it a 5 stars in the food category. Our server seemed a little cold at first, but she was much nicer going on into the meal.\\n\\nWe started off with the pork belly appetizer, which is pretty tiny, even for a pork belly dish, but it packed an amazing taste in that small package. My girlfriend fell in love with it, and it was some of the best pork belly I've had.\\n\\nI went with the hanger steak, and it was cooked perfectly, but it seemed to be a bit on the colder side. The flavor was good though, and it was a perfect medium-rare as ordered, so it didn't really effect the meal too much. The potatoes that came with it were okay, but I really liked the cold pressed carrot vinegrette. It tasted great with the steak and garlic puree.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the pizza with pepperoni, onion, and roasted garlic, and it's straight up one of the best pizzas I've tried taste wise. The end of the piece I tried didn't really hold up to the toppings, so it kind of drooped, but it tasted so so good. Next time I'll probably get one to myself, because I think it definitely holds its own with the likes of Harvest and Natalie's.\\n\\nOverall, if I go back again, I'll make sure not to plan anything else for the night, or to at least plan accordingly. The dining experience took about an hour and a half, so if you're planning on catching a movie afterward, make sure you time it out. In my opinion, as with so many others on here, the food is definitely worth the wait.\\n\\nSide Note: I'm not a big complainer about restrooms, but for a higher end restaurant, the bathroom was pretty bad.

I thought it was ranch, and the waitress brought be a new one and it was the same.  It doesn't taste anything like blue cheese.  I can't figure that one out.  Go buy a bottle off the shelf of generic Kroger brand and it would be better.   All in all, if you aren't in a hurry, this is a good wing place.  It's not off the charts good, but solid.  I think the kitchen, and more importantly the bar needs to be staffed better at peak times.  We were there for 4 hours, and we were watching the games and taking our time, so it was fine.

It's the old Starlight Diner, which I never patronized when it was open. However, I already knew what Frank was about - hot dogs. And my friend had been wanting a hot dog for a while. I wanted waffles, and a waffle search on Yelp will pull up this gastronomous establishment because of their many variations of waffle fries. So I compromised.\\n\\nIt seemed to take a while to get service, but when we did, I realized there was just some mix-up behind the scenes as to whose table we were. Nevertheless, we were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant in a full-on traffic area and no one even stopped to ask if we'd been helped for several minutes. When a waiter finally did, he turned out to be very attentive throughout our meal and on a personal note, he seemed to be having a good day, and I love when a good attitude spills over into my dining experience. \\n\\nI had the Jackalope \\"artisan\\" sausage made with local antelope, rabbit and pork topped with a huckleberry compote, fancy aioli and cheddar cheese. I thought the cheddar was just phoning it in since they'd created a total gourmet hot dog and topped it with an everyday cheese. This and the slow service are why I knocked off a star. I do like cheddar but I'd pay an extra dollar for something like goat cheese instead. Although that all might be overwhelming with flavor. In any case, the dog works well without cheese. \\n\\nMy friend had two Chicago dogs topped with all the fixins they come with and we shared a large order of chili cheese waffle fries. He loved both hot dogs and we pretty much devoured the waffle fries. 'Nuff said.\\n\\nI'd like to go back and try the other sauces that accompany the waffle fries. I'm not a waffle fry fan normally, but I do like a good sauce paired with some form of fried starch. A lot of other Yelpers had many good things to say about this place, and there are strength in numbers. Try it for yourself!\\n\\nNOTE: Frank does have a weekend brunch we learned, but it's only on Sunday and they only serve breakfast until 11 am I think."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"461 N Central Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"4","text":"We are from Texas and are big fans of Chick-fil-A so when we randomly drove by this location in Atlanta, we were excited to see it was the very first Chick-fil-A - so I decided to go through the drive-thru.

We were very disappointed. \\n-It took a very long time for us to get our food, and when it did arrive, everything but the fried chicken was cold. They also forgot our appetizer. \\n\\nConsidering this is a popular (or the very least storied) restaurant in Atlanta, we thought the food, which was largely Southern comfort food, would be great.

Great flavor combinations, and perfect compliments to the main dishes.\\n\\nThe chick pea crepes were excellent, and I've found their chicken dishes over the years to be solid and delicious.

The cashier had a binder the size of the new testament filled with pages and pages of printed off names, emails and telephone numbers for the people that purchased the lunch deal... Not only did it take her quite some time to locate my coupon, I wasn't so fond of having some of my personal info sitting in a binder on the counter of a (surprisingly) busy spot.

She was working slow AND was behind from the mountain of orders piling up.

I also was not impressed when people 4 or 5 behind me in the line were receiving far larger orders than me and leaving before my dreadfully simple panini was up. Also, would it kill someone to smile? I am beginning to think business owners dislike the groupon holders and if that IS the case, why do them!?

I grimaced but got over the bread, and woefully scraped some of the onions off (thus taking 3/4ths of the swiss with them as well) as I had decided against trying to fight through the crowd to get my order corrected or else I'd never make it back to work. The food was severely under-whelming and as I mentioned the bread was stale. The roast beef was similar to something you'd get at a cheap supermarket deli or out of a package.

Today we talk about the 313 featuring Detroit style pizza.\\n\\nThe name comes from the small metal pans used to bake the pizza; back in the day automotive workers would use these pans to hold smaller parts during vehicle assembly. This smaller pan leads to a rich and flavorful crust that has a satisfying crunch when you take the first bite. My personal opinion is its the best crust in town; even my haughty NYC friends/pizza snobs praise said crust.\\n\\nThe topping list is fairly standard with some new eclectic options such as the partnership with Michi Ramen leading to a ramen pizza.

I had the vegan curry bowl. It was spicy and flavorful, and served on wheat berries, which I thought odd at first, but worked really well. The guac and chips was a bit of a disappointment. The guac was tasty, but the chips were few and not very light and crispy. Instead of wine or beer, we opted for Lyfe water - healthy, juice infused drinks. I had the Cucumber/mint one, which I probably won't get again as it was a bit bland without much flavor, but my guy had the hibiscus tea infused with beet and other juices, and it was amazing!

It's a dive bar serving Italian food located right next to Giacomo's. Sounds like business suicide to open up next to one of the most popular Italian places in all of Boston, but I'm proud to say Anchovies definitely holds its own. \\n\\nWhen you walk in you'll see the bar and if you walk in a little further back you'll see some tables and booths. We sat down immediately without any wait (vs the hours you could wait next door), ordered some beers, and decided on the short rib ragu gnocchi. The gnocchi dish was awesome. There's a reason why all of the yelp photos are of this beauty cause it really is that good. The short rib added a different flavor than your typical meat sauce while being super tender and still full of rich tomato flavor. It's going to be hard to go back and try anything else on the menu cause it really was that good.\\n\\nThe only thing keeping me from 5 stars here are the truffle fries. I love bar food as much as the next kid and truffle fries are the epitomy of just that. These fries however just weren't all that great. I'm a fan of the skinny fry but it almost tasted as if the truffle oil they used was old. It had a weird after taste that only more beers could mask. \\n\\nOther than that I loved it here.

Wait time for my falafel roll up was around 15 minutes (had someone else ordering before me).\\n\\nI got my falafel to go and it was wrapped well. Opening it 5 short minutes later, the falafel was nice and hot (freshly made!) with all the things you'd expect in a falafel, but could've done with a bit more tahini. The lettuce however was on the stale side and the falafel could've been fried a bit more. The wrap itself looked like it went through a panini press and that made for a slightly cruncy texture as I munched through it. Not a bad touch.\\n\\nOverall I would say its a decent falafel, the little extras can make it great but I wasn't expecting the world when I walked in.

My true rating is more like 2.5 stars out of 5. That being said, half of our experience was great. The other half, not so great. We ordered the crab fries and deviled eggs for starters. The fries were a creative, somewhat widely thick curly fry. They were fried golden brown and seasoned well. The fusion of the fries with the lump of crab didn't strike out palates in a good way. Wouldn't order that again. Neither would I order the deviled eggs. There were too many ingredients, overwhelming my palate in this case. Plus, the smell that came from either the beef or the eggs totally turned me off. Had a smell like kids who have been playing outdoors all day. Our entrees were better. My crispy beef was excellent. My friend's lobster fried rice was bland. She was able to add taste to her satisfaction by requesting the pineapple sauce. And lastly, the sangria was probably the second best part of the meal, next to the crispy beef. For the amount of money we paid, the food experience could have proven much better. Dining outside was nice. Eating inside would have been a turnoff. The dining area is small and tight and the place had a smell that would have made me want to turn straight around and depart.

After looking it up because I had never heard of it before and finding out it was pizza/Italian (which I normally don't go crazy for), I wasn't thinking Cafe 47 would really be up my alley (having been chosen completely randomly because it was the only place in the city that could accommodate a table of 7 on Chaotic Boston Graduation Weekend), but oh was I wrong.\\n\\nThe atmosphere here in this smallish restaurant is casual, dark, and cozy, with lots of candles and dark wood, a place that would be good for either a casual bite with friends or a romantic date. Our waitress was excellent, very attentive and super friendly, and the vibe of the place was very calming and welcoming.\\n\\nThe boy and I split a large pizza ($16), half corn and bacon and half BBQ chicken, and it was delightful. I am not a crust fan, nor do I usually prefer pizza that isn't cracker-thin, but I devoured each entire slice, tasty crust and all (and without wishing the crust was thinner, a rarity for me). Both halves of the pizza were really flavorful and I couldn't stop eating either... the corn and bacon was more of a white pizza full of cheese with a perfect balance of the sweet corn and the salty bacon (so unique!), while the chicken BBQ wasn't overly 'tangy' for once which is awesome (I feel like I usually have to deal with either an overly spicy BBQ sauce or raw pungent onions, neither of which appeals to me, but not here, the flavor was on point!). The BBQ side was absolutely crammed with toppings, making it difficult to pick up with your hands (not necessarily a bad thing, but I always do feel sort of silly using a fork and knife on pizza), but the corn and bacon was easily picked up. Others at the table got the corn and bacon and margarita, and everyone was really satisfied and happy. Splitting a large left me just at the full mark (we didn't have any apps beforehand).\\n\\nBeer here is just $4.50 (!), and they have some cool things on draft, like Hoegarden and Rapscallion (plus a small but interesting bottle selection). Pizza prices are also solid, especially for the 'gourmet' flavors, and being happily full for $8 at dinner makes my wallet and stomach very pleased.

Of course, we took her up on the Salmon Chips. They were wonderful. I also fell in love with the way they recycled the wine bottles to use as water bottles. \\n\\nI reviewed the menu online prior to arrival and had decided I wanted to try the brisket and mac-n-cheese. Well I was sorely disappointed when we got ready to order and the mac-n-cheese came with BBQ chicken, not brisket. I guess the online menu was outdated. I don't really like chicken, but I ordered it anyway because I wanted the damn mac-n-cheese. The chicken was bland and with little seasoning, yet it was juicy. But the mac-n-cheese was totally worth it. \\n\\nMy mom got the steak, they cooked it perfectly for her. She found it rather bland, but I tried it and liked it. I could actually taste the beef along with the seasonings. \\n\\nThe portion sizes are huge in my opinion. I only ate a couple of bites of chicken, but did manage to inhale the mac.

It came with no BBQ sauce. Apparently they had some (but only 2 kinds, Texas and South Carolina) but we had to ask for it. If you get BBQ of any kind there should be BBQ sauce either on the plate or in bottles within reach. She said even without any sauce that the pulled pork didn't have any wow factor.

As a live music venue, just about the same can be said. The weirdest thing about this place is that it generally exists halfway between those two points, and that's the main thing I like about it. You can come here to do nothing but drink and play pool with friends, but there's almost always a live act going on in the stage area to the right of the bar. You may enjoy it, or you may not, but this bar is big enough that you can carry on and have a decent time no matter what your level of interest in the live show may be. With the exception of open mic nights on Mondays, there's usually a cover to get in, but it's worth noting that there's almost always a decent enough drink special going on to negate the fact that you just spend five dollars to stand around while some touring Dave Matthews knockoff band does their best impression of the music that made you wish you were 15 years old again. I'd suggest buying enough rounds of $2 shots to drown that out of your mind as fast as possible. S&G plays host to Mike Perkins for \\"Hippy Night\\" every Wednesday, which features a free cover, cheap pitchers, and some of the friendliest (and smelliest) kids you'll ever meet in the OSU area. I'd be more inclined to call them lifestyle smokers than I would actually hippies, but they're an amicable lot and are usually a decent time to hang around. The music is obviously on the jammier side of things, but it's free, so why not? If reggae is your thing, then it's worth stopping by on Thursday to check out The Ark Band, one of the most capable and crowd-pleasing reggae acts you're likely to see grace a stage in Columbus on a weeknight. These guys definitely know their stuff, and they actually look like they grew up in Jamaica to boot. On a weekend, there's usually some sort of aforementioned touring band trying to make a buck, which generally garners mixed results. Your best bet is to poke your head in for a second and see if it's worth staying for. If it's not, you've got 100 other bars within a five-minute walk of here, so you don't have much to lose."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is Off The Chain.

The beer, for what really appears to be a \\"dive bar\\" is a bit pricey and the Guinness just never tastes right (lack of pours/not cleaning out the lines is my best guess).

One thing I wish Home Slice would do is not allow patrons to hang out and just chill when there are wait times.  If you aren't ordering more food or drink you need to leave during peak times as people are waiting on the limited seating.  Our group had to wait an extra 40 mins beyond the original wait time because the table we were waiting for was just hanging out, chatting.  I said something to the hostess and she said it was the owners who allowed people to do this.  Time to revisit that concept and put on a New York toughness attitude towards inconsiderate guests that do such a thing!  I know in the real NYC they wouldn't tolerate such behavior."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo Doughnuts are a Portland classic, so the line is always filled with tourists who want to cross it off their bucket lists.

The price may be equivalent to 2 pizzas from franchise pizza companies but the pizza at La Ruota Pizzeria is on such a different level. They use less oil so it doesn't taste all greasy after having a slice and extra fresh ingredients.

For someone who loves blueberries and coffee, this is a \\"must\\" that you have to try. Their hot dogs are fairly priced. \\n\\nThe regular hot dogs that you may get at a regular stand average around 5 dollars which is a pretty good deal since the meat they use is of higher quality since they make it either in-house or locally at Hudson Sausage, Co.

The only Latinos I saw were the help.   Just a bunch of hapless gringo customers.\\n\\nAs for the food, the menu is quite extensive, but a little on the pricey side.  What I did like was the refried bean dip that came gratis along with the chips and salsa.    I've had better salsa.  I came with a fairly large party (about 8) and it seemed everybody else was happy enough with their meals -- and portions were good sized.  However, I ordered some kinda marisco (seafood) chimichanga thingie and it was covered in a cheese sauce that I swear was Velveeta based.   The rest of the dish was purdee bland too.  But Velveeta cheese sauce is un-freaking-forgivable.\\n\\nFTR, I did live in SoCal for many years and am accustomed to authentic Mexican chow from mom 'n pop places, and those are the types of places I search out when I am looking for Mexican food.\\n\\nI will never eat there again and cannot recommend on any level to anyone.

As it turned out, we were in for a treat. \\n\\nSince we are only here for a short visit, we treated ourselves to everything on the menu that sounded the least bit intriguing. Overall, I can say that the chef has textures down.  Everything \\"ate well,\\" which is to say, the textures always complimented each other and added to the overall experience of each dish. In particular, the potatoes in the green curry and the antelope heart.  Speaking of the antelope heart - would you suspect that it's the best thing on the menu? I would not have ordered it, but I'm so glad that my partner did. I can't even pinpoint the genre of that dish - in the best way possible. It's incredibly flavorful, and the wine pairing is not to be missed.\\n\\nOther highlights include: the bean salad with romesco sauce - perfect start to the menu; ceviche with peach juice; rabbit terrine - like a deconstructed version of the most satisfying chicken and rice soup you've ever had, plus a kick (!); delicious lightly pickled veggies sprinkled throughout the dishes; and a strawberry pie that made this cake-lover appreciate why pie has such a following. \\n\\nTo top everything off, the service was wonderful. Our waiter and the kitchen were willing to accommodate our request to try the dishes one at a time, the wine notes were thoughtful and not just rehearsed, and the ambience was beautiful. \\n\\nI would easily recommend this restaurant to friends traveling here to taste some of the best food that Austin has to offer. The price for the tasting and wine pairings was incredibly reasonable, especially when you consider the time and technique in each dish.

The pizza *is* greasy, and some of the toppings *are* a little weak, but the crust to sauce and cheese ratio is spot on perfect. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I'm not worried about finding a chain place anytime soon."},{"name":"Beyond Coffee","address":"1015 Burrard Street W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Perfect Coffee , great Oat meal no printed menu cards .

Luckily they open at 11 and we only had 10 minutes to wait before opening.  It claims to be the oldest restaurant in the USA; ok, I'll buy into that.  \\n\\nThe clam chowder was pretty good with large pieces of clam and a smooth creamy texture to the broth.

And I lived in Dixie for a few years. \\n\\nThe menu prices are extremely high for the quality of the food.  I guess that the pricing is due to the tourist pricing and the niche of it's age.

We joined our group after we finally received or check and paid. The server at the restaurant side was much more on it, she promptly took beverage and appetizer orders and returned quickly with the product. Dinner was a hit and miss, the chicken schnitzel on my husbands plate looked like chicken strips not like the other ones at our table.

I will definitely return!"},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I've been coming to Santouka Harvard Square since it first opened. It was love at first taste, their Kara miso and miso ramen are the best I've had - the broth is so nutty and flavorful. It's rich but not to rich where it leaves you feeling queasy with a food coma afterwards. Noodles are cooked perfectly al dente, giving every bite a satisfying substantial chew. Lines to get in can be long when school is in session (Harvard is next door) and they have a weird wait list system that quotes very inaccurate wait times. But I've never had to wait more than 30 min for a table as the staff does a very good job turning over customers.\\n\\nSo why the mediocre review? I feel that over the past year, portion size has significantly decreased while prices have gone up for all their menu items. When comparing pictures I took of my food from a year ago to now, I see that they've stopped adding complimentary nori to their basic miso, shoyu, tonkatsu ramen bowls. The pieces of pork in the ramen have also gone down - a regular sized miso ramen used to come with 4 pieces of tender pork but from my visit yesterday, I only received 2. A small ramen will now only get you 1 piece of pork... Really? I don't know of any ramen place in Boston that gives you so little protein. The Karaage chicken combo option also used to come with 5 pieces, this past visit I only got 3. Paired with increased prices, I find it harder and harder to justify the value of getting Santouka. And while I can understand why they would raise prices, I don't understand why they have to skimp on the actual meal itself too. It's such a double whammy, I feel like I'm getting cheated two times over. \\n\\nSo while the ramen itself definitely beats the rest of the competition, you'll definitely be paying a premium for a lesser amount."},{"name":"Sweet Cheats","address":"692-B Kirkwood Ave SE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Sweets Cheats is THE ABSOLUTE BEST cupcakery in Atlanta!

This idea is great and the location, ambience and menu are all pretty enticing. I've been there twice now, and both times left slightly disappointed. On the first visit, my wife and I ordered two of their more basic hot dogs (my wife is gluten intolerant so the gluten-free buns are a major incentive to go there - hats off to Frank for this consideration), plus the chili cheese waffle fries. Because the fries were embellished with cheese, bacon bits and a few other additions, we didn't realize until we'd already started eating them that the waiter got our order wrong and gave us the standard cheese fries. Not a huge deal, really, but it was made worse by the fact that the fries seemed to have been left under a heat lamp for a long time, rather than being served fresh. The cheese had hardened and the fries had gone a bit limp. \\n\\nWe liked our dogs well enough to give the place another shot (like I said, getting the fries order wrong isn't unforgiveable). We had the same waiter, and I can only conclude that he has some kind of medical condition that prevents him from hearing the word \\"chili\\". We ordered two chili dogs and the baked potato salad, but were served two Chicago dogs instead. He was nice about replacing them, but the potato salad had the same problem as the waffle fries - barely warm enough, with congealed cheese and a sitting-all-day-under-the-heat-lamp texture. Furthermore, when we got our chili dogs, the chili was also kind of lukewarm. Apparently onions and relish are an option, which we definitely would have preferred, but our waiter never offered them to us. \\n\\nI'm willing to give Frank one more shot, because I do like the menu and I want this place to deliver.

The spot that I sat at had a orange napkin. The orange napkin matched my scarf spot on. The waiter asked if we wanted a drink other than water and my husband ordered a ice tea. While we were browsing the menu again, the waiter came back with the ice tea and water. We asked him for some recommendations and he suggested a few dishes that he enjoys. \\n\\nWe shared the following appetizers:\\n-Empanadas (acelgas) filled with braised spinach, mushrooms, eggs and mozzarella. Very tasty!\\n\\n-Pimiento Piquillo Relleno is sweet piqullio peppers stuffed with quinoa, cheese and Serrano ham. Pretty and satisfying.\\n\\n-Trio De Papas Y Salsas Peruanas is 3 types of dipping sauce with bread. All the dipping sauces was delicious.\\n\\nFor the main entree both my husband and friend ordered the Arroz Con Mariscos. I had the Seco De Res. The short rib was very tender. I did try the Arroz Con Mariscos but it was just okay. It lacked some sauce. \\n\\nAs for dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Andino which is a dense brownie with a thick layer of chocolate ganache. I couldn't resist gold dust on chocolate. Since it was my birthday the waiter also brought out a additional tray of 3 mini short bread cookie sandwiches with Carmel as the filling. Out of a all the dishes I particularly enjoyed the appetizers and my dish. \\n\\nOur waiter was very attentive to our needs, refilling water and ice tea. Service was excellent. There is tons of seating if you arrive right when they open. I saw many customers walk-in without a reservation but I'm sure for dinner a reservation is recommended.

I REALLY DID. \\n\\nI made reservations on open table. I called and requested a table that wasn't super tight and near a window. It was a friends birthday. I was told that shouldn't be a problem. We get there and we are seated in this long row of booth/tables literally less than two feet away from the next table.\\nI sucked it up and tried to make the best of it because the inside is SOOOOO NEAT! The decor was so modern and sleek. I ABSOLUTELY ADORED IT. The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant too and it's mostly surrounded my glass!!\\nSO! Their wine selection was great! They offer about 25 different wines by the glass in different sizes and IT'S GREAT FOR SHARING. We split a the small Malbec. Which was about $20 and maybe 3 glasses of wine. NICE!\\nThe food was decent. It was nothing special AT ALL. \\nWe tried the Georgia White Shrimp ($16) in the coconut curry as one of our appetizers. Our server told us it was spicy.\\nWhich I LOVE SPICY. The portion was decent, but it was bland and no where near spicy. It was a yellow coconut curry. The flavor was somewhat there, but it needed something. THE SMOKED SALMON CHIPS WERE AMAZING. At $14, I felt the portion was fair. They come in orders of four! I was worried that they would be drowning in cream cheese, but it was quite the opposite. They are super generous with the salmon. The chip itself was slightly creamy, smokey and the chip is seasoned with house spices. They top it off with capers and red onions which add some bite! \\nWe also tried the baked oyster appetizer which was $10 for 4 super small oysters. They were rich and the oysters were topped in this garlic cream sauce and cheese. I wasn't too crazy about them. I've had way better..\\nThe pimento cheese hush puppies were $10 and you get THREE. I was disappointed in the portion size, but they were decent. The inside was rich, creamy and the chilli sauce bed beneath these puppies was very spicy. I LOVED the sauce more than the puppies..\\nNext was the kale salad. It was $10 and a little bigger than my hand. It came highly recommended by our server. This salad was weak. It was missing black currants and I had maybe one or two pine nuts. The goat cheese is drizzled on top which was nice but it wasn't that explosion of flavor I thought it would be.\\nWe both ordered the flat iron steak as an entree. THIS WAS A $32 shoulder cut.. VERY OVER PRICED. The portion was decent but the quality was POOR. The steak is served with a chimichuri sauce on top and a side of herb whipped mashed potatoes, green beans and mushrooms. The chimichurri sauce and the potatoes were the best part of this entree. Everything else was bland and under cooked.\\nWe had two servers and we had to ask for silverware and plates THREE SEPERATE TIMES between courses. They were great at clearing the table, but not so good at replacing the silverware, app plates and water.\\nWho wants to eat a steak with a cheesy fork!? My friend got her birthday dessert but had no idea what it was. The server dropped it off and walked away... that was very disappointing!!! \\nEverything came out very fast, but with prices as high as they were, I expected our servers to course our meal a bit better. All the apps came out back to back and the table isn't even 2 feet wide. We had to hold our menus while we snacked on apps. (Until we decided on entr√©es). \\nThe food was OK.

Creative menu. Locavore focus.  Wine friendly. Chef owned (aka mom n' pop). All people are welcome ambiance.\\"\\n\\nThat was our answer when a local artisan cheese vendor asked us, \\"What kind of food and settings do you like best?\\"\\n\\nWe had asked him, \\"If there was one restaurant you think we should be sure to experience during our week in Austin, what would it be?\\"\\n\\n(The best people to ask about good food are those selling good food.)\\n\\nHe recommended Lenoir where he had just attended a soft opening.  A good recommendation and it should have been the perfect match for us. \\n\\nBOTTOM LINE EXPERIENCE:  But as it turns out, we found it just OK with hits and misses. We're glad we went. But we would not go back. Nor would we recommend this to others visiting Austin given \\"so many restaurants and so little time\\".  \\n\\nThis little restaurant reflects the passion of the husband (chef) and wife owner team and it was newly opened when we visited.  So I thought about how to make this review respectful of their investment and a honest reflection of our experience realizing new restaurants can also need some time to work out kinks. \\n\\nAMBIANCE:  This is simply a matter of different strokes for different folks because it is clear a lot of thought went into how to create a unique ambiance economically. But the white on white setting with white sheer draperies covering the windows in this tiny space resonated with us like an ethereal Tim Burton inspired movie set of dream verging on nightmare. Even as we walked in, we were thinking this wasn't a place that we wanted to linger in and dine but eat in and leave. \\n\\nSEATING / SPACE PLANNING:  Seating format is a common table down the middle of the room with table height seating for about ten people. Seats at this table are backless wooden benches. (With a little shelf on each to stash handbags out of the way.)  Other seating is roughly six high seats at the bar on wooden stools with backs as well as bar height tables ringing the room with the same stool seating for roughly fourteen (?) more diners. \\n\\nHard wood seats may be fine for a quick in and out meal, but are uncomfortable for longer service. Then again, we may be outside the demographic the owners have in mind.\\n\\nAs good job was done for space planning for such a small space to lay out seating in a way that allows for circulation around the room for diners and wait staff.\\n\\nFOOD FORMAT :  Prix fixe, small plates service of three courses was $30 with an option for an additional course for $10 more.   The menu is organized with a few choices in each of these headings: FIELD - LAND - SEA - DESSERT. Based on our experience one could order from among those headings or all three choices from one heading.  \\n\\nOUR MEAL:  My husband and I ordered from each of the headings. \\n\\nWe thought the FIELD options were outstanding. As example, a chickpea panisse with wilted winter greens was \\"lick the dish worthy\\", as was the polenta dish. \\n\\nFrom SEA, the shrimp with XO sauce and kale was good enough.  The grouper option had great flavor but arrived with fish underdone and tough. \\n\\nFrom LAND, the agrodolce chicken served with lettuce cups and daikon was disappointing. Devoid of sweet and sour flavor that is the essence of agrodolce and blandly seasoned. \\n\\nDESSERT, the cheese plate with charbier, grapefuit confit and nougatine was a nice end point. \\n\\nWINE:  The list is small but carefully crafted to accompany the food with a few bottle offerings and also a few by the glass. We enjoyed a glass of Alsatian Pinot Blanc ($13) and a German sparkling wine ($12). Good quality glassware was used, pours were adequate and temperature at service was just right.\\n\\nSERVICE:  Given how small the space is, it must be difficult for the servers to be both as efficient as they were and as unobtrusive at the same time.

Space planning for tables allows clear path of travel. Couple seated next to us had a newborn in a baby carriage with them; given the carriage was maneuvered through the space, I imagine so would be a wheelchair. \\n\\nTIPS:         \\n\\n1) MAKE RESERVATIONS. Given the small size and the serving format takes some time to deliver each evening this is unlikely to be a place to serve walk ins easily.  We made reservations for 5:30 on a Tuesday, which was Lenoir's second day of public dinner service.  By the time we left about 7:30, many seats were full in spite of a pouring rainstorm that one might imagine would deter diners. \\n\\n2) Perhaps the worst seat in the house is a two-top right at the entry. Folks seated there when we arrived seemed displeased for sure. Avoid it if you can.   Were I the owners, I'd turn this space into a host station as they don't have one inside, and \\"86\\" this poorly sited table."},{"name":"Grill On the Go","address":"10175 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This was a great gyro fresh tzatziki sauce fresh vegetables not too much bread definitely would recommend it tell em Rick Thefoodcartguy sent you & keep Portland weird eat at the carts."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We visited Lenoir on the evening of Black Friday and while we are not much into the shopping craze of this particular holiday, Lenoir's cozy, intimate atmosphere was a welcome change from the bustle throughout the city. The food was very, very good - of our 4 person party, we tried the roasted beet crepe, the soft egg tamal, the snapper tataki, the poha-crusted snapper, the grilled chernoula lamb, the pork cheek goulash and the guava cake. According to the waiter, the portion sizes are all 3-4 oz. For most people, you will walk away full but for others, be warned that this $45 three course meal may not be filling enough if you tend to opt for bigger portion sizes. Lenoir separates their menu into four options: Field (salads, vegetarian focused plates, etc.), Sea, Land, and Dream (dessert). You can choose three plates from any of these categories. Heck, you can even order the same dish three times (I almost wish I had done that with the snapper tataki - it was fantastic). Lenoir specializes in what they call \\"Hot Weather Food\\", so any dish that borrows spices and influences from regions with warmer climates is bound to be on point. For example, all four of us ordered the poha-crusted fish on recommendation and it was wonderfully flavorful - apparently the chef used to work at an Indian restaurant in NYC? Three of the four of us decided that it would probably be a better idea to skip dessert and not order from the Dream section at all - this was a great choice. The one guava cake ordered at the table was surprisingly a bigger portion than we thought it would be, but not that impressive. Similarly, my family seemed satisfied but not overly impressed with the soft egg tamal and roasted beet crepe from the Field section, though of course the presentation was very pretty. The stunning dishes of the night came from the Sea and Land sections - those would be what I recommend to any future diners (since the menu changes every week). I would be mad that we spent $5 on sweet potato focaccia bread if it hadn't been so fantastic. The wine the waiter recommended to us was nothing great; nevertheless we are vaguely interested in trying the wine bar and happy hour selections since the outside patio area seems cute - the kind of outdoor area with strung lights that will be swarming with yuppies come summer. \\n\\nTl;dr: Don't order from the Dream section of the menu. Heck, don't even order from the Field section of the menu. The best dishes of the night were from the Land and Sea portions of the menu. Wine is OK, bread is great but pricey. Make a reservation ahead of time - the restaurant is small and cozy."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Loved it!

I got the blue devil which was recommended as their most popular burger.\\n\\nThe bacon tasted decent, but was a little bit too thick and didn't have the crisp texture I was really expecting. The buns were ungrilled which perhaps is asking a bit much, but for a ~$8 burger, I'm expecting a pretty high quality level. The patty was good (all of their beef patties are grass fed hence the name), but otherwise, the burger tasted a little bit too one-dimensional. The crispy onions that were inside the burger didn't really show up in flavor when I did eat the burger. \\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the portobello mushroom burger which she said was decent as well. She did compare it to the mushroom burger they have at Shake Shack though and I think in terms of the quality it was at that level. I do think it's a unique experience given their more boutique feel, and focus on sourced ingredients, but if I'm going to buy a burger, I could get something at the lower price and same quality from a nice shakeshack. They did have interesting fries choices and side dish options (fried pickles!) which is definitely an appeal to the restaurant. \\n\\nGood concept, but I feel like the execution is stuck at this area in between really good  locally sourced burgers and typical burger chain in terms of quality."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'll try to make this short and sweet...debated between Mary Mac's and Gladys Knight..decided here due to reviews.

We were told to be exactly there at 11 am for seating but some of our members were late due to parking.

Our group occupied two round tables, one seated seven  members, the other seated six members.   \\n\\nAll in all, our experience was a very good one at Cadillac Cafe.  Cadillac Cafe  was rated by five of our Foodie members, averaging a 5 stars out of 5 stars.  Our Foodie  members were very happy with their food and service at Cadillac Cafe.  I had the famous French Custard Toast With Seasonal Fruit and Roasted Hazelnuts.  The portion was huge.  The French Custard Toast came with real maple syrup and a blob of melted butter on top.

No. We're regular customers, to a point where most of them know our order off by heart and they all know of our eating preference. It's very sad for me to know that I've been eating this chicken stock this entire time. I will never go back to this restaurant, and I will never recommend it to anyone I know.

On the up side they're serving the real deal - the meat is slow cooked in a smoker on site, and the smell alone is worth a visit there. On the down side I felt the brisket was a bit too fatty for my liking. The pork ribs were tasty and juicy as well, but perhaps a little undercooked - i like ribs with the meat falling off the bone, and these ribs just weren't quite there. The potato salad was very good, as was the chipotle cole slaw, although I got tired of the intense chipotle seasoning before I finished my meal and wished they had been a little more conservative on the seasoning. The line was 25-30 people deep when I got there at 11:30, and hadn't let up a bit by the time I left at 12:30.

These donuts are no more tasty than almost any other donut I've had in Portland. Heck, even some of Krispy Kreme's donuts are higher in quality.\\n\\nThe only reason this place remains popular is because of their unique flavors and the emergence of modern social media. While most won't admit it, going to Voodoo focuses on taking pictures and spreading them on social media, rather than judging the quality and flavor of the donuts.\\n\\nThis place is very nearly the equivalent of an edible museum. Have you ever wondered what the Mona Lisa painting tasted like? No, and you shouldn't, because that's weird. Some of their flavors are unique, and maybe one out of 30 actually tastes good. But to compare their basic flavors to other places, I'm underwhelmed. \\n\\nDon't be fooled by the fad. Eat the donuts for what they are, and judge accordingly. Once you've done so, I think you'll agree that this place is overrated. In all honesty, this place is average, and probably deserves a 3-star rating. But to compensate for the influx of misleading high reviews, I'm obliged to give a 1-star rating.\\n\\nOn a side note, I wouldn't consider this place family friendly.

I had no idea Hog Island was no longer in existence; when I saw kraft paper on the windows and that the doors were closed I just assumed they were doing a little remodeling. I always liked Hog Island. The food was good and it had an old school deli feel to it. I don't know why they closed, but that's really not the point of this review.\\n\\nFriday night my boyfriend and I decided to check out Cherry Street. The first thing that struck me about Cherry Street was the unfortunate renovation. They took everything that is charming about an old building and covered it up with Home Depot cabinetry and wood laminate flooring. The lighting is harsh (in fact the bright lights from the semi-open kitchen overpower the dining area), and worse, they were playing the most horrendous music....think soft jazz...you know, like Kenny G. What I find even more puzzling is that they are trying to make it a cocktail place. Included in the renovation is the addition of a new bar. Unfortunately, there is nothing about this place that makes me want to stay and drink. It's just not a space I find to be warm or inviting or comfortable. I think they would've been better off closing the kitchen from view because the bar/kitchen combo they've got going on just isn't very appealing.\\n\\nThe food on the other hand was pretty good. A bit pricey for the portions, but fairly solid. We ordered the roasted tomato, basil, and mozzarella pizza and the Trofie with basil pesto and parmigiana reggiano. The pizza was very small (think personal sized pizza), which threw us off a bit, but it was a tasty little pizza. No sauce, and not much mozzarella, but I liked the parmesan they used on it; it gave it a nice saltiness often missing from pizza. The trofie was also tasty, but again, a pretty small portion. For $13 I think it should've come with some bread or a small side salad.\\n\\nOverall, I think I'll go again, but probably not for dinner. I can see this being more of a lunch spot where I eat and then quickly leave. For dinner I just feel like it misses the mark in terms of atmosphere, which is also the reason why if I want a cocktail I'll just go down the street to Dive."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is obviously a must visit when in Portland!

I brought a friend that was visiting from out of town. Being new here I had not been to Voodoo yet either. I wouldn't wait in line for it if I didn't have an out of towner with me with a time frame, especially with the camp out of people asking for change on the corner where the line wraps around the block. That's just annoying, especially when they're parked under the only spot that's covered when it's raining. I also got a $60 parking ticket for not backing my car in the spaces just out front. It was raining, and I was parked between two big SUV's (one parked front in and one backed in) in my little car so I couldn't see the two signs on the ends of this parking strip that said to back in. I'm hoping they will let me off if I take a picture into the courthouse that shows that I really couldn't see that sign. \\n\\nDespite all of that, it is a fun place if only because it's different. I like independent businesses that figure out how to do so well selling things as simple as donuts! The staff doesn't have time for you to be a slow wishy washy goober at the counter but they weren't ever rude. They weren't overly nice, but there's a lot of potential to be rude and the staff was generally pretty nice. After reading reviews, waiting at least 20 minutes in line, and just seeing the set up, I was happy to not have to face a tragically hip jerk at the counter. They were out of the first 4 donuts I wanted to try but egh... it's a doughnut! It's not like they don't have a variety AND they did tell me that more were coming up if I wanted to wait. \\n\\nThere was a little poster with just a very few donuts with descriptions on it by the glass case. With how busy it gets I'm blown away that they don't have more of those up to help people decide while they wait in line!!! I have to believe it would make the line go so much faster! I'd probably give them that last star just for that since the line situation is ridiculous and there's a pretty simple solution that would at least make it better. OH, AND CASH ONLY!!

I've heard tourists go to Mary Mac's, and heard my parents talk about that one time they went there and how lovely it was. Everyone came to town and wanted to go. I dreamed about how cool it would be and how amazing the food would be. After all, all of these people couldn't be wrong, right? \\n\\nAnd they aren't, I guess. It's ok. Is it a must while you're in Atlanta? Absolutely not. Skip it. We've got better. While it does have the down home country food it's known for... it's no more special than any actual country restaurant, and significantly pricier. Not to mention getting there and dealing with parking is exceedingly annoying for the average food you're about to consume. Parallel parking doesn't scare me. But would I do it for Mary Mac's. That's a resounding no. \\n\\nSo... I highly recommend the tomato pie. If you're any kind of mac and cheese fanatic like I am... don't get it here.

Both in review and in-person I have seen some major impatience and arrogance when it comes to this place. I have eaten at this business, hm, at least five times. Probably closer to ten. And there are little things that could be better but in no way did those things completely detract from my sushi-gorging experience.\\n\\nService: It isn't as bad as people say. I have been there during lunch/dinner rushes and the times between. Sometimes yes, the wait staff will miss your refill. I tend to get hot tea so as far as that goes, it isn't a transparent cup and not easy to catch at a glance how full it is. So sometimes, you will have to catch a server's attention but it is never a long, arduous ordeal. One has to realize that these servers are seating people, serving drinks, taking and serving special orders at times, tallying empty plates for the bill, busing spots, replacing condiments, chopsticks, etc. and playing cashier. Also, there is a non-belt sushi section which I am sure those servers must manage as well. There are probably duties in the kitchen that they might have to do at times too.\\n\\nThis isn't a setting where the servers constantly check on you to the point of being annoying. This is the sort of sushi where you can read a book and not be pestered while you eat or have a convo with your partner and not be hounded about \\"if you need anything else\\" like they're trying to rush you out the door. Sometimes people sit and linger, looking to see if they want more so it's sometimes hard to tell when a customer is actually done. Do not feel like you are so high up in your own little world that you cannot spare the briefest flicker of effort to lean back and wave politely if you need your check. \\n\\nFood: As with most belt sushi, I recommend going during or right around peak times. Sure, there will most likely be a wait to be seated, but it is the best time to get the most variety and freshest pieces without having to special order. I have had the bad luck of going once when they had finished their rush and were slowly switching things to the right side to close the left side down so I did have to special order a few things and run over and snatch a few plates I wanted from the \\"preferred\\" side but eh, it wasn't horrible. I'd still recommend going during busier times to avoid leftover plates or the endless parade of California roll variations.\\n\\nThe sushi is good for belt sushi. It isn't made by sushi masters so don't expect anything super fancy or very traditional but it has a good flavor usually. The rice is just normal stuff and doesn't taste like it has rice vinegar in it. The cooks are quick and fairly attentive, I'll give them that. But their presentation is usually loose and falling over/apart on the plates. If you are too slow with your chopsticks, many pieces will highly likely break into two or three sections before it reaches your maw. And food gods forbid if your sushi bit was hovered over a dish of soy sauce (you didn't like that shirt anyways, right?)  If I was looking for a masterful work of food art, I would go to an expensive, sit-down/dress-up sort of establishment. I go here for cheap eats that are tasty and won't make me sick.\\n\\nTL;DR: Stop acting all entitled. If you need a refill or your check, wave a server down. They're nice and they're trying, I promise. Go during busy times for fresher foodstuffs. Special order if you don't see what you want. Food here may not always be perfect and pretty, but it's great fast food sushi."},{"name":"Milestones Restaurants","address":"1145 Robson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Super helpful and chatty waiter.

There were also roasted pine nuts scattered on the dish that was a nice touch. \\n\\nPork chop over a butternut squash risotto: The pork chop was done perfectly (slightly pink in the middle).

I checked it out on the basis of its yelp rating. The French toast was indeed very good, but the service was terrible. W also ordered Mac n cheese fillet Mignon, and they only brought us the Mac n cheese. It was such a killer bummer, so we just canceled the steak since we didn't want to wait another 20 min for it and have the Mac n cheese just be cold. The whole point was to get the combo. Our waitress said she was sry and that she never heard the part about the steak, but it was silly cuz we specifically asked if it would be a good dish to share between two people... On top of that mistake the waiter who brought the food was like totally weird. When we told him about the missing steak his response was, \\"I feel like I would have noticed that.\\" I mean c'mon! He then I asked if we wanted a plate to share the rest of the meal, but then never came back. I had to ask our waitress to get us one a few minutes later, after us passing the plate back n forth. \\n\\nOverall the waitress was nice, but kinda incompetent and our food was okay. Yes the French toast was good, but it alone couldn't make up for all the bad service and mediocre Mac n cheese. (They gave us this huge bowl with all this fancy looking cheese on top, but it was an optical illusion. There was only one layer of Mac n cheese before the bottom. I'd never call this a meal for sharing.... What a joke.\\n\\nAlso the decor which I'm guessing they were going for was like totally boring and looked like a cheap hotel on the inside.

Pork and chicken broth, pork chashu, kikurage (wood-ear mushroom), spicy bean sprouts (which gives the ramen a slight kick), green onion, 1/2 seasoned egg, crispy Brussels sprouts (yes!), black pepper and ginger ... and of course the Ramen noodles. Nice presentation. Broth was very flavorful and the pork was delicious.

Great crisp, flavor, and crayfish really nice and chewy.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n- Grilled catfish fillets - really good!

The waitress was knowledgeable.  I ordered the crabmeat wontons because I felt pressured to order something else in addition to my entre.  I did it based off of other reviews.  The wontons are not at all what you would think they should be.  The Caviar on top could not be tasted because everything else including the stuffing of the wonton overpowered the caviar.  They seem interesting but clearly I would avoid them.  Infact I feel as though they should be removed from the menu.  \\n\\nNow let's get to my main complaint.  I'm a big lover of crispy beef.  My beef was fairly crispy and that is not the complaint.  The beef tasted rank!  I went on a Tuesday at Noon.  If you had five day old meat sitting in the fridge and decided to try cooking it and see if it taste okay this was worse than that.  I expected more from this place.  As well, you know when you batter meat and cook it and you have several pieces stick together and you fry it and their is raw dough between the two pieces.  I had that with four of the pieces of meat.  Indeed, had they not put meat in the dish at all, it would have been delicious.  The presentation was beautiful.  I flew to Atlanta to have great meals.  That was my sole reason to fly there.  I did not have one here!  The two stars were for the staffs knowledge and the presentation and effort.

This shop is tucked away in the arcade and is a pretty small space, so even on a weekday night (Thursday), we left our names for a table for 4 at 650 and didn't actually get to sit down until 830. They try to expedite the process by taking your order ahead of time but it honestly wasn't that much faster. That being said, i had the ganko miso ramen with the shitake mushroom broth, while the boyfriend had the same with the regular pork broth (which is a deeper and more flavorful choice,  so I was kind of jealous). The noodles are chewy although the ramen itself doesn't come with a lot of extra veggies (just some small pieces of cabbage,  probably because they unfortunately ran out of bean sprouts). I do like that they give you an egg without charging extra though. The pork is just ok. Thin pieces of somewhat dry pork, the pork at santouka is undoubtedly better.  \\n\\nOverall I think the soup base and broth are fantastic,  but the meat and veggies leave much to be desired.

You've done your research, you see this place as over 3k reviews and it's been deemed as \\"Atlanta's dining room\\", plus many celebs have come here, it's a \\"MUST\\", right?! Such a regret from my experience. Sometimes when a place booms and gets a lot of excitement and attention, it's looses it's true charm over time. I went here around 3-5 in the evening because I wanted to avoid a crowd and parking issues. Succeeded at that. I was seated right away. That was the last good part of my experience. It took about 15 mins to even be acknowledged by my waiter. This person passed by my table several times and avoided eye contact because they were busy. Not even a hi or \\"sorry, we're swamped I'll be with you ASAP\\" what's odd is that there were plenty of empty tables, didn't seem that busy. Waiter finally takes my order, seemed to have a bugged out attitude. It's all about the food though, right? I ordered a margarita, fried chicken, Mac and cheese, and broccoli souffl√©. Chicken was hot, but very very plain, I'd pick anything else on the menu. Especially if you've been hopping around ATL trying more flavorful interesting fried chicken, you will be disappointed here. If go to say that fast food fried chicken taste better. The Mac and cheese looked pretty, but add a weird flavor and texture. I didn't even finish it, Who doesn't finish Mac and cheese?? The broccoli souffl√© was decent, but what's it matter if I don't have anything good to eat with it? The Margarita never showed up, my waiter kept saying it's on the way, but it never came and she had 0 remorse when I told her to just cancel it. She obviously gave fake verbal updates the whole time. I had planned to order dessert but after my thus far experience, there was no way I'd be silly enough to do so. A lady at table next to me I overheard complaining about something as well to the waiter and even sent back a dish. Portions are large but I didn't even want a togo box. Slowness, and forgetting things I can deal with, but a yucky plate is what earns you 1 star. I certainly wish I could have that night back and spend time at another establishment instead.

However...\\nI live one block from Paramount, and tried it for brunch for the first time about 3 months ago after hearing A LOT about how great it was.  Now, I'm willing to wait a long time for good food.  A long time.  Especially if I've already had coffee, or, if it's dinner, if there's a nice bar area to wait at.  And I get it, we went on Sunday at brunch, but on the earlier side.  The line was inside the door.  I perfectly understand the idea behind the system...you do get a table by the time your food is ready, and it moves people in and out very quickly.  What I don't like is the insane awkwardness of waiting in line here, having your ass in every other diner's face, feeling awful because busboys can't get by you, and practically having to sit on someone's table so that they can, and then when you finally get to the front of the line, having the people in front of you have no idea what they want to order, because the menu is pretty small and hard to read.  I also don't like no free coffee refills (I don't know if they actually don't have free refills, but i do know it's way too much of a hassle to get back to the counter to find out) or carrying a heavy tray with hot coffee and juice through a huge crowd of people over my head to a table.  But all this would be forgivable.  If the prices weren't, in my opinion, insane.\\nSo again, why three stars?  My food was memorable.  My omlette with bacon and spinach was really stellar.

And I'm not completely sure why I wasn't into it sooner. Especially for a chain restaurant, Tijuana Flats really hits it out of the park--well-made, delicious AmeriMexican food combined with the type of attentive customer service that you'd usually only receive at a sit-down restaurant. More than likely when you walk in you'll be asked if you need to look over a menu, which contains a plethora of options. Don't anticipate a short menu with just the 3 basics (1. Tacos 2.Burritos and 3. Quesadillas). At Tijuana Flats, the basics are there plus chimichangas, flautas, and norritos, just to name a few. But so far I have to say that my personal favorites are the Bangin' Chicken Burrito (the Smack My Ass Bangin Chicken sauce is so good that my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it) and the Fish Tacos. \\n\\nAs far as this particular Tijuana Flats location goes, it actually happens to be a standalone restaurant (as opposed to being located in a plaza) which is unique. The purple and yellow building definitely makes it hard to miss. Another benefit of the standalone location is the fact that this restaurant has both indoor and outdoor patio seating. I will point out, however, that the construction out in the Casselberry area may make it slightly difficult to figure out exactly where you need to turn in to get to this Tijuana Flats. \\n\\nBut the one thing overall that really caught me off guard about this and all Tijuana Flats in general is the above average level of customer service. Although you place your order at the counter, servers bring your meal out to your table AND periodically check on you to make sure you don't need a drink refill, salsa, or anything else. That small thing is something I feel really makes your entire experience at Tijuana Flats. Somehow, it really makes you feel like the restaurant cares about you as a customer. \\n\\nAnd that is why I will be going back to Tijuana Flats in the very near future."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The atmosphere is fun but the quality of doughnuts isnt the best.

When Five Guys opened up I thought this was the place for me.  I saw all their accolades on the walls and assumed I was in for a treat.  Not at all.\\n\\nWhat I got was two thin over cooked patties swimming in grease and a giant sack of greasy fries.  The bag becomes darker where the grease from the fries soaks into it.  When I opened the burger I could see the grease on the foil wrapper and it soaked into the bun so that it became mushy and fell apart as I tried to eat.  \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love a juicy burger with the right amount of fat in it.  The problem is that these patties are so thin that they don't hold in the rendered fat that makes a burger so good.  I'm not a fan of rare meat either, but these burgers are thin so they cook quickly and there is no need to leave them on as long as they do here.\\n\\nThe fact that they're cooked to order isn't anything to brag about I can't think of a place where they aren't.  Go to Krystal and look at the line around the building of people waiting for their gut bombs to be cooked.\\n\\nThey do give you a lot of fries, but that may be where the problem lies.  When anything is put into a fryer the oil temperature drops for a moment.  The more that is put into it the longer it takes to recover.  If it stays below 375¬∫ for too long the oil penetrates the food instead of cooking the outside.  I think thats why the fries here are so greasy and soggy feeling.  \\n\\nThey have all these bags of potatoes lying around so you can see how fresh they are and put a sign up indicating where the potatoes came from.  Seriously?  Who cares where they were grown.  It's a common white potato.  The one with the least nutritional value on the planet.  What good does it do to import these rare delicacies all the way from Idaho if you're only going to ruin them in the fryer later?\\n\\nI tried the hot dogs once.  They split them and put them on the flat top to cook them which is fine by me, but they are insanely salty.  I never gave them another shot.\\n\\nI think everything on the menu is overpriced for what you get.  The burgers are priced in line with most places, but most places have a bigger and better patty.  While you get a lot of fries, they aren't very good and if you spent the same amount at Wendy's or McDonald's you'd have about the same amount of fries.  The soft drink prices are out of control.  That's been happening in a lot of places over the past few years, but I think Five Guys has had the highest I've seen so far.\\n\\nThey do have free peanuts though.  I've never eaten any, but they're probably good since they didn't actually try to cook them.\\n\\nI may seem overly critical of this place, but if you put a food item in the name of your restaurant then I expect it to be exceptional.  If I was at an Italian restaurant and got a bad hamburger I wouldn't be surprised."},{"name":"Le Muse Coffee Bar","address":"505 Wynnpage Dr","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"5","text":"Friendly face, cool space, and good coffee!

This month's choice was Lenoir.\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n-Ambiance: I absolutely loved the middle farm table with the beautiful light fixture and the community seating. The restaurant only seats about 30 people and it's extremely intimate. \\n\\n-Service: the person helping us select the wine and explaining the food/specials was terrific. She didn't seem rushed. She didn't make us feel like we needed to hurry. She was informative and friendly and went above and beyond taking a few photos for us and then retaking them when the lighting was bad. She never seemed annoyed or anything (unlike a lot of restaurants around ATX these days).\\n\\n-The pace of the meal: extremely European in atmosphere and most of all, the pace. The meal took several hours and we thoroughly enjoyed the courses and not feeling like we were being rushed out the door so they could get on to the next. I enjoyed the flavors as they weren't right on top of one another. The six of us had 3 bottles of wine over several hours and it definitely reminded me of the times I've spent in Europe.\\n\\n-The food: all of the flavors were interesting and delicious. I loved the bread, my seafood choice and my land choice. Flavorful, cooked perfectly, presented artfully, and portioned well. Thumbs up!\\n\\nThe average: \\n\\n-The desserts: of all 3 deserts we tasted, the coco leche cake was the favorite for me, but none were stellar. The other courses were absolutely delicious so it was slightly disappointing. And I say this lightly because nothing was bad, it was just \\"not as\\" stellar by comparison.\\n\\n-The service: once during the meal, we were with empty wine glasses for a good while until someone came by and we ordered another bottle and then had to wait for a bit for it to come. By far, the service was great overall, but this could be improved.\\n\\nNote: nothing was even close to bad, only a few things I would suggest they try to do better for the price point of the restaurant as a whole; we spent $500 before tip for a party of 6 and we could have spent more if we had ordered better wine.\\n\\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed this entire experience and evening with great company and food, it is not something my budget would allow frequently.

I fail to see how this is a family establishment, but then again I fail to see how McDonalds is taken seriously as a burger joint so I guess these chains work hand in hand.\\n\\nThe place was like an large bar, with a little bit of charm in its wooden interior and plenty of corporate decor reminding the patrons they were indeed in a hooters.  Aside from the sports playing on the big televisions, there were quite a few stations where one could purchase their very own hooters memorabilia.  I couldn't muster the courage to get a shirt for my buddy's mother, who happens to love souvenirs.  She might've been a little too stacked if you know what I mean.\\n\\nI could barely concentrate on the menu as a couple of waitresses came over to our table.  With a group as large as ours, we were oddly situated with two gorgeous ladies who were scribbling very quickly on their pads.  The action only generated more excitement from our rowdy group of annoying guys, as the girls decided to do a \\"pose\\" of a slight lean and hands on the hips.  This prompted one of our guys to say:  \\"I'll have THAT for dinner!  And everything on the menu!\\"  I ordered a grilled cheese myself personally.\\n\\nThe food was a nice simple, bar ladden version of Americana.  Chicken wings, burgers, even nachos, and of course beer.  I had a little bite of everything and I can easily say the wings were not all that.  The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was actually fairly tasty, with a little kick to the sauce they had somehow soaked into the meat.  My Grilled Cheese was plain, but then again, it's hard to make those sandwiches amazing without any decent bread or cheese.  Oh and it was $10.  That nothing like their $12-15 burger platters though, so I guess I got the cheap stuff.\\n\\nThe final capper of the night was being pulled out by a few of the pretty ladies to participate in some sort of a group dance / performance.

Incredibly distinctive and addictive. The toasted bread crisps were a great transporting mechanism, and added some crunch to the cold soft mozz.  \\n\\nThe Ricotta Meatball was decent. Pretty good flavor from the meat mixture. The arrabbiata sauce was not spicy, and I liked that.   \\n\\nI was really disappointed with the Half Poutine. The dish was (at best) warm, to start.

Today was the first time I went to try Voodoo Doughnut.  I will not make a special trip to go back.  Here are the positives.  It is a donut shop and they make pretty good doughnuts overall.  The selection is \\"obscene\\" in more ways than one!  Who needs such a selection?  Tourists, I suppose.  Serious donut eaters do not need this kind of place.  The service is good!  Every cash register was open, and although there was a line, people were be being served quickly, efficiently, and by people who were seemed knowledgable.  That's it for the positives.  Here are the negatives:  1. Severely over priced.  Their maple/bacon bar, a legend for them, is $3 each!.  Most donuts are above $1 each and I'd say the average price is about $2 each.  We bought 4 donuts and it cost us $7.15.  2.  No parking.  This place is in an urban area so parking is sparse.  We lucked out and found one nearby, but we had to put money in a meter to pay for the space, so no bargain there.  3.  Homeless person begging at the front door is a nuisance.  We gave him money, but come on, do we really need this at the front entrance?  4. No tables inside.  The only tables are outside (it was raining, as usual this time of year) and they are surrounded by homeless types, etc.  So, in summary, if you are a local, pass this place up.  The doughnuts are not so good that you need to go through the hassle at this cramped location in a less than desirable spot in downtown Portland.

So we tell the waitress and the waitresses like oh yeah that's really rude what she's listening to blah blah blah never once did she ask the lady to turn her phone down. So I guess the owner comes out and she access is everything okay I tell her no. In the process of me telling her no the lady said no everything's not alright she stopped talking to us to go over there and sit down and talk to the lady because they're friends. So she comes back and apologize it's what she was should have never went over there and talk to the lady in first place you should have waited. I proceeded to tell her my concerns and she said oh I can't make her turn her phone down. To me that's kind of crazy this is your establishment you can tell a person to do anything just ask nicely and she should be able to do it. With my first and last time going into this establishment. That was the worst service ever. Customers should feel comfortable and not uncomfortable while in your establishment. I never once said a manager or anyone who owns a business come and tell me they can't tell a person to turn their phone down. Myself I'm in a restaurant business so I know how it goes you can ask the person nicely and it doesn't make sense for owner or whoever the lady was to come out and tell her she can't tell the lady what to do with that was just ridiculous I do my best to try to support black-owned businesses however we as black people need to do better.

Because of this, it feels quite warm in there, partly because it is crammed with so many people and also, the exposed kitchen is in the center of the restaurant and features a wood-burning grill. That definitely heats things up, quite literally! We had a fan at one end of the table but I don't think it was enough. A lot of people were complaining about how hot it was in there. Personally, I don't enjoy sweating while dining at a nice restaurant.\\n\\nSince we were part of such a large party and the restaurant wouldn't seat us till everyone had arrived, we got seated quite late. That was not their fault though I wish they wouldn't employ such a policy. Our server, Bacon (I wasn't positive he was being serious about his name) was incredibly funny and a great server. I could tell after my bf and I had placed our orders, he was getting exasperated with some of the rest of our party because of their requests/indecisiveness. I completely understand. I think despite his frustrations, he did a really good job. One of our party had send his brisket back because it was very dry. He soon received another huge piece to his liking. \\n\\nThe bf and I ordered shaved calamari to start. It had some sweet sauce and wasabi aioli drizzled on it. It was pretty good but not outstanding. I had the bronzed scallops. The dish came with four seared scallops and some watery grits with tomato sauce. The portion overall was pretty small. While the scallops were good and cooked perfectly, the grits were totally off in texture. The bf had the brisket. The meat was nice and tender and the chili cream corn was pretty good. I wouldn't order it for myself since I am not a fan of fatty meats (bf gave me a \\"fat-free\\" piece).\\n\\nWould I go here again? Most likely not. The menu has some very limited options.

I suggested Victoria Seafood because I have walked by it many times and know that it was inexpensive from the sign posted on the window for 2 lobsters for less than $17.  We ordered the steamed fish and twin lobsters with ginger and scallion.  The bill was less than $30. I think Victoria deserves at least 2 stars for being so cheap.\\n\\nI had warned this boy in advance that it was entirely kosher to eat lobster with ones hands in Cantonese culture.  Plus we were in a semi ghetto Cantonese place, so it was totally kosher.   Somehow this boy would not have it and refused to dig in with his bare hands.  It made me feel pressure to conform, so I picked up a knife and a fork as well.    In this way, we put away 2 lobsters.   Afterward, I was filled with regret.  It was singularly the most silly thing I have ever done with a boy.  I should not have given in - I should have proudly shown my Cantonese roots.  \\n\\nThe lobster and the fish were both fairly good but not nearly as good as in a few places in Chinatown.   Victoria is not as nice as East Ocean City but you pay a lot less here.  We ordered two mango flavor blended drinks (the kind you get at bubble tea places but they don't have bubbles) to go.

The fish was perfectly cooked and that broth was unbelievably flavorful. The wine that our server suggested was perfect with the dish.

The courtyard is nicely landscaped to make a cozy space. String lights around the perimeter added to the atmosphere. If you too want to eat outside, learn from my mistake, and bring insect repellent. Mosquitos add to the atmosphere in small, medium, and large. Some people moved inside to get away from them. Others waived napkins. As the number of eaters dwindled I found myself being dive bombed by lots of mosquitos, as did the diners in the table next to me. \\nNow about the food. The portions are kind of large for the salad and entrees. \\nGOOD: I got a Summer Squash Salad ($8) that was heavenly. The flavors were all fresh in thinly sliced summer squash, with toasted almonds, cheese and mint. Each bite a different component would take the lead and it was tasty and good. I washed it down with a glass of delicious red wine, from Spain I think, that was one of their two summer picks. \\nWEAK: Next I had Risotto with spring peas, mint and pecorino. It was mostly lemony and hella salty. Thankfully the tasty salad was large, and I ate only enough risotto to finish my glass of wine. I got the half order of risotto ($8) and even if it was good, it was big and I would be hard pressed to finish the half serving. The risotto also seemed runny and not very creamy. The cheese was the best part, and I scraped it off the top before I gave up on the dish. \\nWEAK: Creamy Chocolate Mousse topped with whipped cream, caramel, nuts (served in a wine glass). Sounds good, huh? How do you mess that up? How about you coat nuts with caramel and bury it in the mousse. The whipped cream, chocolate mousse and fudgy bottom layer were tasty, unfortunately you have to maneuver around mysterious and overly sweet chunks bumming out the mousse. The creamy mouth feel is lost when you have big and small chunks to chew and swallow. I tried to eat around chunks and got full by the time I hit the fudgy layer. I would have preferred the nuts and caramel on top. This mousse would have been a winner without flotsam and jetsam. It was also supposed to come with candied orange peel but I asked them to omit it. \\nMaybe I just chose incorrectly for some dishes or they were having an off night.

I have heard of this place many times and my family has gone a few times as well. There are 2 locations in Columbus and this one is more secluded and easier to get to since it is not always busy in this area. They take reservations and also are great at making sure to get you at a table even if you are too early/ late. This would be a great place to have a dinner with a group as well and they have an area you can do that without bothering everyone else. \\n\\nGreat date night place and the food is delicious! A littl pricey but nothing too bad and the quality is worth the price. The waitress we had was younger, in college or high school, so the service could have overall been a lot better for where we were. They appetizers are great for sharing and the portions are great as well. You will not leave hungry and you will be able to get something that will satisfy any cravings you have. \\n\\nThe food here is weird and I am not sure what they categorize it at, but I have been to retaurants similar to this one before. They serve both italian and asian dishes. So whether youre in the mood for pizza, pasta, chinese food, or an asian cuisine that is tredning these days you will find it weird.

The table service is pushy to the point of hilarity; our server saw fit to give my Indian friend a lengthy lecture on the menu. [N.B. - Yes, I realize that Indian and Bangladeshi cuisines are not identical, but they do share some strong similarities.] There are a few drawbacks which prevent me from giving this place five stars. First, you have to make a reservation for dinner every night they're open if you want to dine in. Second, even though all diners have made reservations, the staff and kitchen don't operate very efficiently. It takes about 20 minutes for your order to be taken and then another 45 or so for your food to come. The food is definitely worth the wait, but if Panahar could hep to the whole prep-cooking thing, they'd probably be able to increase their customer turnover and revenue.

Sure, I had Thai food before. In fact, Thai food is oversaturated here in Atlanta. To me, Thai food is always the same. But what does Poor Calvin's do to change things up? Make it Fusion.\\n\\nRemember 5-10 years ago? When Fusion meant sucky Asian food? Well, it doesn't seem like that anymore. I think they're figuring out how to do it. And Poor Calvin's is an example of that. \\n\\nThe Chef, who is also the owner, had his training in Europe. So he does this mix of European and Asian cooking techniques. He does it well. His name is Calvin, like the restaurant. Considering how well his place is doing, he should rename it to \\"Middle Class Calvin's\\" now. \\n\\nThe restaurant feels like a maze. When I first walked in, it looked like a tiny space. But It's an illusion. They have several rooms. There are plenty of seating inside and outside. It's actually a large but intimate space. \\n\\nWe tried the appetizer tasting. It had Watermelon, Basil, and Goat Cheese Salad; Spring Roll; Fried Calamari; and a Pork and Daikon Bun.\\n\\nThe Pork Bun looked like your standard, trendy Pork Bun you can get everywhere. White fluffy bun folded over a piece of meat like a taco. I would say this was the weakest item I had at Poor Calvin's. The meat was tough and small. The bun seemed stale. It wasn't very good. \\n\\nI didn't get to try the Watermelon, Basil, and Goat Cheese Salad because of my allergy to watermelon. But he was kind enough to substitute the watermelon with something else. It was actually a good salad. I loved the flavors of the dressing and the vegetable. I couldn't believe he could make salad taste good. \\n\\nTheir spring rolls was probably one of the better spring rolls I've had. They fried it perfectly so it had that nice crunch. The fillings were delicious. I'm not sure what was in it, but it tasted refreshing and savory at the same time. \\n\\nTheir Fried Calamari tasted good too. It was deep fried and crunchy. The mayo they put on there was great. They also had some fried pickles in there with the calamari which made for a nice surprise.  \\n\\nFor our entrees, I tried the Lobster Fried Rice and the Seafood Melange. \\n\\nWe ordered a $26 fried rice. $26 for fried rice? I think it was worth it.  It had all sorts of crap in it like garlic, pepper, and onions. I think the onions were a bit raw since it had that bite to it. I didn't mind because it added something extra to the fried rice. The rice also had a bit of heat as well, I don't know if it's because of the peppers or what. The presentation looked beautiful with the gigantic butterflied lobster tail, fried, and set on top of the fried rice. The lobster meat was delicious with the fried rice. I loved it. \\n\\nThe Seafood Melange was great too. The sauce was spicy and creamy. It had a ton of Seafood goodies all over the dish. There were shrimp, scallops, squid, fish meat, and my favorite--the baby octopus. The pasta was squid ink pasta. So it was black and tasted great. And whatever that sauce was, it was pretty good. \\n\\nPoor Calvin's is one of the surprises in Atlanta. Sure, with over 700 reviews and a 4.5 star rating, it shouldn't be a surprise anymore. But you guys need to come in and try it. It's one of the best Fusion restaurants in Atlanta. \\n\\nIf it wasn't for that crappy Pork Bun, I would've given this place 5 solid stars.

How does anyone sleep there? I can barely maintain whilst walking from the entrance to the movie theater. Going to the bathroom? Fuggetaboutit. \\n\\nIt is pretty novel hotel--to have a restaurant, a soaking pool, movie theater and 5 bars all on one crazy complex. But, I think it is better suited for the tourist population, because I feel that the wanderlust rubs off pretty quickly. After 5 years in the 'hood, I wouldn't say I hate the place--I just think I take what makes it so special for granted. So does everyone else though. \\n\\nThe restaurant is jazzy looking, and the waitstaff is hit or miss depending how long they have worked there. Pretty standard McMenamins Menu, in which safety rules. Craft beers that do nothing for my taste buds, and drinks that are a bit watered down. Meh. There is always an outrageous wait, but they give you cool little buzzers so can whet your whistle at another on-site location, and let you know when your table is ready for you. \\n\\nI have only been to the Honors and Detention bars, and I have mostly felt uncomfortable,much like Honors Classes and detentions always felt like to me back in the day. I have a feeling the drinks are expensive because you are essentially drinking at a tourist trap. \\n\\nThe Soaking pool is good if you like wallowing in other peoples grime water. I refuse to go even though all of my pals like it, and I qualify for free admission because of my status as a neighbor. I may consider it if cabana boys in banana hammocks brought me free booze, but they don't so I won't. Pass X 300 on the people soup. \\n\\nHowever, HOWEVER, I love love love love the theater.

When they first opened, the staff was excited, the service was great and the food was very yummy. My husband and i were thrilled to have this place in our backyard. UNFORTUNATELY - the owners have not maintained the same degree of quality over time. We ate there a few nights ago. Our original server, Clay, was there, and he was as friendly and helpful as ever, BUT, he was working hard to serve too many tables and the supporting staff was snarky and downright rude. The food wasn't nearly as good as it had been. The scallops (at $24) were tiny and overcooked. The squash rolls were the diameter of a quarter and the 2 TBS of rice didn't really save the day. When i told the runner i was unhappy with the order, he simply smirked and said, \\"well, i like it just fine, it fills me up\\". WOW!\\nI ordered a drink which was lovely, but the glass was wet and slipped out of my hand. I cleaned up the mess with our napkins. When the runner cleared the mess i explained that the glass was wet and slipped from my hand, he said, \\"THAT's Unexceptable..hahhaha\\" - he ran off and never replaced the drink. Thanks to Clay the situation was rectified.\\n\\nWe went back for brunch on Sunday giving them the benefit of the doubt thinking it was just a bad night. Sadly, the streak continued.

The decor is nice enough, with dim lighting and a classic romantic italian feel, athough it is cramped in there as they stuffed as many tables in as possible.  The beer selection is very disappointing, the waiter seemed to think we'd be excited that they had bud light- on draft- but they do have a decent wine list, although I didn't have any that night.  The bread that they bring out is absolutely delicious, soft fresh warm mini loaves with a garlic and oil dipping sauce.  Our table ordered the mushroom caprese and calamari for starters and I only tried the latter.  The calamari resembled popcorn chicken, not my favorite one but it was breaded and cooked just fine.  For a main course I ordered the Chicken Piccata and I was happy with this.  The chicken was moist with a light, creamy lemon caper sauce and it came with linguini as well.  The serving was big enough that I was full from dinner and had a nice lunch the next day, as did everyone else at the table.  \\n\\nThe service was probably the worst part of the experience.  Our waiter never offered more drinks or to refill glasses, and instead of removing dirty plates he even brought over unnecessary clean ones which cluttered the table.  He was difficult to understand and did not feel professional.  However, we did use a groupon and I told him this at the beginning of the meal and I'm not sure if that affected the experience, as Pannullo's policy is to automaticlly add 18% tip to any groupon meal.   This wouldn't be my first choice on Park Ave., especially with my favorite Italian restaraunt being there, but I would still consider going back, especially if the groupon deal comes up again, as it was well worth it."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Twenty million reviews mostly saying, \\"yes, go here.\\"  Baaaahhh....\\n\\nCaptain Crunch donuts.  yes.\\nMaple Bacon Bar. yes.\\n\\nThat is all.

If you've been to both spots like I have, the similarities in pizza are there -- namely lots of toppings.\\n\\nI joined a friend for a late lunch in early November. He had raved about this place a couple of times, so when the pizza bender kicked in, I figured it was time to try it out. The inside has that pizza lounge feel to it, with games isolated in a section of the establishment. Juliano's calls it a classic rock atmosphere, and its inner walls will confirm that. We sat in the middle, allowing me an acceptable view of the cook in the back making pizza.\\n\\nThe dough is hand-tossed, cooked in a three-tier rotating oven. There are basically five sizes of pizza, from the mini 6\\" pizzas to the 16\\" XL pies that can reportedly feed 4-5 adults. Knowing my appetite, the 16\\" may only feed two of me. Oops.\\n\\nWhile you can build your own pizza, Juliano's has a number of different specialty pies. Their signature is the \\"Hurricane,\\" which is basically a supreme pizza. While the prices are steep (a 16\\" Hurricane is a whopping $30.95), just remember they pile the toppings on like mad.\\n\\nFor my gluten-free friends, they have gluten-free pizza crusts (10\\" and 14\\"). I'm not sure how they prevent cross-contamination issues, though.\\n\\nMy friend and I split a 10\\" (yeah, a good snack for me). I got Hawaiian on my half, while my friend went with Canadian bacon and Italian sausage. A bit of complementary garlic on his half, and I loaded my side up.\\n\\n\\nVery good pizza. Thin, crispy crust. Good pizza sauce and fairly light on the cheese. A nice layer of toppings, just as advertised. It'll be a chore to get an intact slice transferred to your plate, though. Also, if you're in a rush, call in your order well ahead of time. Pizzas may take 25-30 minutes to cook, sometimes longer. I'm not sure if our pizza needed that much time, but only because it was a smaller pie.\\n\\nMeat lovers should get the \\"Hefty Ho,\\" while the veggie lovers should like choices such as \\"The Veggie Delight\\" or \\"The Grateful Veggie.\\" Personally, the \\"Santa Fe\\" (BBQ sauce, roasted chicken, onions, olives, roasted red peppers) also sounds awesome.\\n\\nOf course, if you want sandwiches, salads, calzones, or wings, Juliano's also has those. They say they have \\"wings of fire\\" (buffalo wings), but I doubt they'll ever reach (or would want to reach) the nuclear levels I've faced. Six of those come to $4.95, while a dozen sets you back $9.50. Each sandwich is $5.95, served on ciabatta, and includes chips. Four types (Italian Club, Tastes Like Pizza, Chicken Bacon Ranch, and Gimme the Greek).\\n\\nAs far as their lunch menu goes, it's a \\"build your own slice\\" deal. Two toppings and soda is $4.95. Add a salad to make it $6.75. If you just want a slice of cheese pizza, it's under $3.\\n\\nThey serve Pepsi beverages. I personally don't drink soda, but it may matter to some people that do care.\\n\\nYo beer drinkers! Juliano's has domestics and microbrews. Sizes are pint, small pitcher, or large pitcher.\\n\\nFriendly service -- and I'm tempted to see if I can take down a 12\\" in under 10 minutes. The server there doubted me, and the panda loves to prove people wrong. I'll be back for sure once my wallet decides to like me again."},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"4C Wayside Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"We did an early Father's Day lunch for my husband and my son inlaw who will be a dad in a few days.

I could for sure make this better at home.\\n\\nTwo statements that always kind of irritated me when I read them in people's reviews.  For one thing, shouldn't I be able to order anything off the menu and have it taste worthy of someone risking big bucks to open a business?  Secondly, perhaps the reviewer is a Michelin-star chef or a prodigy of domestic culinary arts - saying you could make it at home doesn't really give me an indication of the quality of said dish.\\n\\nThe Dine Out menu at Ask for Luigi has resulted in me having to swallow my previous words along with some mediocre pasta.  \\n\\nFirst off, we ordered some of their homemade bread.  Maybe it's good when it's fresh but our small, thin squares of bread were stale.  They serve their bread with a saucer of salted olive oil.  Now perhaps this is just my unsophisticated palate speaking, but it needed some balsamic vinegar - some kind of sharper, acid taste to wake up the bland oil.  \\n\\nThe appetizer of fried cauliflower, chick peas, and parmesan was tasty.  The cauliflower had decent caramelization, the chick peas were fried as well which gave them great texture, and the parmesan delivered a nice hit of salt.  The only detractor from this dish would be the hand-torn hunks of basil which covered the entire plate; this is probably more of a personal preference thing, but I don't enjoy chomping on raw basil.  After I had finished, I had a large pile of basil leaves on the side of the plate - enough so that if I was a carpenter ant, my colony and I would be feasting well for a good week.\\n\\nOn to the entree, papardelle bolognese - the source of my self-aggrandizing thought that my spaghetti, and I am as far from Julia Child as Paula Deen is from Michelle Obama, is substantially better than Luigi's.  The pappardelle did not have the best consistency (or mouth-feel, as a pretentious foodie might say).  I prefer a chewier pasta.  There was probably the equivalent of a gum ball-sized amount of meat, minced and dispersed throughout the dish.  If there is bolognese on the menu, I'm expecting meat to be a main ingredient.  And sauce was lacking in flavour and appearance, as in, where was it?  I was basically eating thick strips of plain dough.  Not too appealing.\\n\\nThe desert - olive oil cake - very small portion, about the size of four postage stamps, was palatable but not anything you'd care to partake of again.  \\n\\nSo perhaps, gulp, there are better options on the menu?  Despite the polite service, not sure I'm in a hurry to give it another go."},{"name":"Modelos Market Cafe","address":"501 Medford St, Ste A","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"You might remember a time when Modelo's bakery was across the street from Modelo's butcher and market.

However, if you try to go during any of these peak times, be prepared to wait upwards of an hour and a half to be seated. After speaking with some other customers who were ordering food to go, to-go food orders will take around 45 minutes or more. Communication between employees and customers could definitely be improved. A party of 3 that came about 20 minutes after we arrived (we consisted of a party of 4) were sat at the long table. We had already been waiting for 45 minutes by this time and we were essentially skipped. \\n\\nAlso, allergens on the sauces located on the tables are not clearly labeled. As someone who is allergic to fish, I was quite taken aback that they would serve sauces without clearly labeling the allergen information on the bottle. \\n\\nThe soup quality on this visit was also inconsistent. My ramen came out piping hot, whereas my boyfriend's ramen was lukewarm to the point of almost being room temperature. They remedied this by placing his fresh soup under a heat lamp. \\n\\nFinally, the physical space is almost claustrophobically small. Our table was in the middle of the server/customer walkway. We kept being bumped into by servers, busboys, and exiting customers. After already feeling noticeably uncomfortable, we were told that the customer wait list was growing and asked if we could exit if we weren't planning on ordering more food/drinks. Our tab was over $100 and we were approached in this disrespectful manner less than ten minutes of us tipping, which we tipped well despite how the night was already going before this moment.\\n\\nThe only reason why I am gives 3 stars instead of 1 is that I have never received subpar service like this in the past from this location. I came to this location for my graduation party, to which I invited my entire family, and we were treated very well. The food is very delicious and we are repeat customers.

I giggled at his ridiculousness, but I guess he was annoyed. For the price, I expected a little better. 3 stars\\n2- service staff at dinner was attentive, friendly, and knowledgable.

My husband got a corn beef hash breakfast burrito that he loved. I ordered eggs Benedict. They came out cold. I was pretty bummed, however when the fresh ones came it was very good. Fruit was fresh and delicious. Good quality coffee. Just bc eggs were cold (and I still had to pay- which I don't mind, but I consider it going above and beyond when the kitchen/management takes it off in consideration of your experience) so 3 stars.\\n5- our waiter for brunch, Timothy, had wonderful customer service. Extremely attentive and friendly. He was very quick to fix the Benedict problem, and that was the kitchen's fault, not his. 5 stars\\n6- the epic fail- valet parking. If we ever go back, we'll walk blocks to avoid it. Having both kids and tons of people checking out to leave made it busy. But waiting 25 minutes for your car is obscene. Especially when those that came 10 minutes after you, were gone after waiting 5. We got more and more flustered, especially having the kids there. They knew we had been waiting forever but they weren't overly concerned to get our car. Finally I figured out that they couldn't find our keys. I went through the cabinet with the valet, the keys were nowhere to be found. Finally he opened the drawer, and I found them myself. 3 minutes later the car arrives.

The spices are rich and are presented in unexpected places such as the drinks we ordered: PHO for me and Sun Spot for my friend.

But all in all just average I could make soul food better at home. The black eyed peas were mighty good though, so maybe it's just a matter of ordering the best sides. The cornbread stuffing was also under seasoned. I think generally the food was close to being really good but because they were nervous with the seasonings every thing was just meh. I guess go because it's a place that everyone says go to but the food certainly isn't exceptional"},{"name":"Armando's Pizza & Subs","address":"163 Huron Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Solidly good pizza.

Lasyt night was not up to par for sure. First they removed the rabbit and venison from the menu. I was actually told that Americans are just not adventurous enough to even try it so they removed it. So I had to decide on something different.  I went there because it was my husbands birthday and he love German food.  I ordered Latkas or potato pancakes. They were greasy and tasteless.  I was surprised.  I was also surprised that no fondue came with the meal.  My husband ordered Mushroom schnitzel.  There was no veggies, no kraut, no purple cabbage, no spaezzle. He got a bit of mashed potatoes.   The portion was tiny. Lucky he had a huge stein of beer...it made him not notice.  I ordered the Chicken Cordon bleu. This did have some veggies that were over cooked but flavorful because of the paprika on them. The mashed Potatoes were cold and had formed a crust on the top. I got about two ounces of them. We had to ask for bread. My son's meal was supposed to come with a drink but we were charged extra for a drink.  He got a bit of fondue with his meal but it was not as good as normal. My son loved it because it tasted kind of like the cheese you get in mac and cheese meals.   I received no jams, no fondue , no cabbage or spaezle (or how ever its spelled) on any of our meals. The portions were very small and I actually left hungry.....mind you I spent 60 buck on this. So disappointed. The waiter was super nice.  Maybe I should have said something to him right then and there but he was just so nice I couldnt.  I didnt want to give him an issue when all the issues were the restaurant itself not him.  My husband got the apple something for his birthday for free. Meh...the apples were not cooked very much and it was pretty tart and flavorless.  It was free so what ever.

It was really good still.  What stood out for me was the beef patty.  It was seasoned just enough so that it still tasted like beef.

I also ordered the onion rings with my meal.  They were alright but nothing special.  \\n\\nIf you're craving a burger you can't go wrong with Vera's, I would definitely go back again.

He let me try a bite and I have to say that a barely tasted the sauce because the marinade had just a kick of heat! But I loved the tenderness on the inside and the blackened crunch on the outside!\\n\\nI went with the chicken and pork dumplings. I believe I got a plate of five and they were a nice size - not too small. They were generously covered in an oil (olive or maybe sesame?) and a fresh herb (cilantro?). There was also a ginger soy  dipping sauce on the side. While the texture and presentation of these dumpling were everything you could want, I have to say that while the dumpling was extremely mild in flavor (too mild for my tastes), the dipping sauce was too strong. It just didn't strike a good balance for me. So I have to say this isn't a dish I would order again. \\n\\nLuckily, the desert, the reason for my visit, did not disappoint! I decided to try the Suspension Cake for two reasons. 1. I'd never seen anything like it. 2. One slice was the size of my head. Seriously, this thing had to be at least 7 in. tall/thick and 3.5 in. wide. There were also a few layers to this cake. Starting at the bottom - a 1 in. layer of red velvet cake. Then about a 5 in. of whipped cream with strawberries and boba balls (strawberry and mango flavors). Another 1 in. layer of cake. It's topped with a thin layer of chocolate ganache and crispy caramel balls! The cake itself was just the right amount of moist and had more flavor - although mild - than any red velvet I've tried. The whipped cream was light, sweet and went perfectly with the berries and boba! What a fun and unique thing to do with a cake! The layer of ganache was rich and dark, a great balance to all the sweet! The waiter mention that he'd only seen about four people finish this cake on their own. Well, he can make that five.

Get through the doors and you realize how huge this place is - you would never know from the outside! Loved the decor, ambience, and yes of course, the food! I was already recommended the salmon chip and it was well worth it. We also tried the tuna tartar, cheese plate and calamari - not a wrong note anywhere! Hung out for about 2 hours and enjoyed every part of our appetizer meal. We were in early but the place got packed pretty soon for dinner.

Granted, it's hard to fuck up fresh lobster, mayo and a buttery roll, but it was worth $22 for the amount of lobster in the roll.  The yuca fries were a surprising and delicious accommodation-- not as greasy as real fries, but very tasty.\\n\\nMy mom got the mussels and for $15, it was a huge portion and the mussels were juicy and big.  \\n\\nThis is not a place I'd casually visit -- I only went because I had family in town and wanted to impress them with the view.  I was expecting the food to be mediocre, but it was good.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.  I guess the only reason I'm hesitant to give them 4 is that the lunch menu is kind of limited.

First my rule of thumb for any new restaurant is the waiting period. I always wait usually 1 or more months before I visit. The waiting period gives me time to hear others (friends, etc) take on the new place. The second is more for the restaurant itself to sort of hit its stride if you will. \\n\\nThe restaurant had been open roughly 2 months when my wife and I visited the first time. We split the shrimp fajitas and were really disapointed with multiple factors of the dish. For the price (over $12), you would really expect to see some decent shrimp. The shrimp were scare as were there size. I can buy medium shrimp at the HEB direcly across the street for $5 per pound if there on sale. Thats roughly 40 shrimp for $5. Its not even close to a reasonable mark up for the dish. Maybe the restaurant is still trying to pay for that trendy interior? Next was the overwhelming amount of oil on the fajita skillet. The kicker of the meal was the rice was crunchy.  Maybe I should wait 3 months on my waiting period?\\n\\nLast weekend we visited Nuevo Leon for breakfast. I was the lucky joe to call in and win breakfast for 4 from KEYE. I brought my wife, our baby, my parents, and some family friends. The breakfast menu at this location gives you three choices. Migas, tacos, Huevos Ranchero. The majority of the table experienced the migas and everyone agreed it was a par breakfast. Nothing to knock our socks off; buy good none the less. That morning the salsa had a better flavor than I remember from the previous visits. The service was friendly and respectable for a 6 top with a baby being passed around. \\n\\nWhen we got the bill I presented the server with my gift certificate and asked told her we would pay seperately for the two additional diners.

When I was in middle school, I learned how to operate a grill solely so I could have a burger whenever I wanted it. At the time I wanted to replicate that pancake-thin american-cheese-encased excuse for a patty that they sell for $9.50 at ballparks and county fairs. My tastes have advanced since then, but all sorts of burgers have a place for me--thick or thin, with loads of toppings or naked, high quality or ballpark quality.\\n\\nBurgers and fries are my number one food craving. For the sake of being a normal adult, I have to actively stop myself from ordering the burger *whenever* I see one on a menu. If I manage to deny myself the burger, I still have to find a reason *not* to get a side of fries.\\n\\nSo you can imagine my enthusiasm on hearing that there was a new gourmet burger joint in town. Since Grass Fed is nearly always packed and often has a line out the door, I figured the place had to be awesome. It's my kind of food--high-quality ingredients, fun menu items (adult milkshakes, poutine(!!)), indulgent. My wife and I planned our trip for days. \\n\\nUnfortunately, even a week after our visit, I still find myself thinking of this place--wishing for the food it could have been and a bit shocked at how far off the mark it actually is. Maybe it was an off night and maybe I didn't order correctly, but the food I got was downright awful. I tried three things--the oyster burger, the spicy fries, and the black and white stout milkshake. The milkshake was pretty damn good--a good balance of the stout flavor with the sweetness of the ice cream. Thanks, JP Licks. But, I could just barely eat the burger or the fries.\\n\\nThe oyster burger comes with fried oysters, tartar sauce, and a burger patty. I admit I was a little suspicious of the tartar sauce before I ordered, but I figured this was a place that was paying attention to their food and I could trust some expert chef to do the right thing. I also blithely assumed that the fried oyster would be the lightly breaded type, because that is the only type of fried oyster I could think of that would actually go well on a burger. \\n\\nWhat I got was not the burger I imagined. First, the oysters were not lightly breaded, or even heavily breaded. They were thickly battered (a good 1/3\\" of batter), greasy, and deep fried into inedible oblivion. The oysters did not look like oysters at all but instead resembled those American-style Chinese food \\"chicken fingers\\" that look like an orange dog penis. Two of these monsters were on my burger and hiding under about one and a half tablespoons of thick tartar sauce. Now might be a good time to mention that the burger patty itself is pretty small. This is not a problem in and of itself, but when you are trying to balance flavors, the beef to toppings ratio makes a big difference.\\n\\nI took a bite of the thing as composed and could taste no beef. The flavor was completely overwhelmed by tartar sauce and greasy batter. Paired with the buttered potato bun (which I usually like) the bite turned into an unappealing gummy mass in my mouth. No oyster flavor, no beef flavor, no textural contrast, no good at all. What the what is going on here?! Did anyone try this thing before it went on the menu?\\n\\nI scraped off the oysters and the tartar sauce. Maybe there is a good burger hiding under here? It is quality grass-fed beef, after all. Another miss. All I could taste was salt. If this is great beef, it should stand on its own with very minimal seasoning. Too bad I didn't get to try it that way. I tried the oysters on their own too. Again, no oyster flavor, just batter. What's the point of murdering expensive ingredients so you can't even taste them? The fries weren't quite as bad as the burger, but were limp and lifeless and I couldn't see the point. Sometimes I like limp fries, but in the context of the gummy texture of the burger, I really needed something that had a bit of crunch.\\n\\nIf the food had been any good, the atmosphere and the price would be easy to stomach. Some of my favorite places in Boston pack you in like sardines but the food is so heavenly it's totally worth it. I'm also a fan of paying for good food with thoughtfully sourced ingredients. But we shelled out $40 for my wife and I to stand at a squished counter and eat some of the worst burgers I've tried in memory. As it is, I don't see that this place has any of the elements for a good restaurant--bad atmosphere, bad food, breathtakingly expensive. \\n\\nGrass Fed gets two stars because I liked the milkshake and I like the concept. I really want this place to be good. But on my visit, I didn't just get mediocre food, I got bad food that I did not want to eat. I won't be back."},{"name":"Flying Cat Coffee","address":"3041 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It was a beautiful day when I arrived at the Flying Cat. I wanted to sit outside and enjoy a great drink, which did end up happening. The coffee shop itself seemed a little dark, but the barista behind the counter was quick filling my order for steamer and a shortbread cookie, before going back to rotating from his station behind the counter reading or coming outside by the side of the shop to smoke. \\n\\nThe outside seating area felt crowded and while the sunshine helped keep me in place like a snake sunning itself on a rock, I didn't feel very comfortable sticking around. There was a lot of construction around the cafe, and a lot of walking traffic that made the sidewalk feel a little congested. While I don't mind tons of noise, I do like some peace while reflecting, and I didn't find it here at the flying cat. \\n\\nWhile I do feel slightly ambivalent about my experience here, I did really appreciate the amount of cat decor and really enjoyed the decked out bathroom. It was pretty rad."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Checked out the place after seeing it on Tv and it was way cool, the food was good, not a doughnut lover but they do taste fresh.

I came in Thursday afternoon and noticed how quiet it was so asked for a table instead of the bar for drinks. We were seated at a beautiful table by the window with menus and no one came over ever for our drink order. We were invisible- we finally got up and left after 15 minutes of looking around and waiting for our server. I was very disappointed and won't be going back for a while."},{"name":"Jack & Benny's Downtown Diner","address":"12 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is average as is the service.   They will not do separate checks or even let you split the check when paying.  Unfortunately there are not many options downtown on the weekend.   Customer service is better at the fast food joints around the area (potbelly, sub way and rustic pizza)"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Another great experience!

Service was awesome and the steak was so juicy and tender. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes and the beans. I would go back every time we visit Orlando!!! It was reasonably priced (54.00 for two adults for a Saturday night dinner) and family friendly"},{"name":"The Whip Restaurant Gallery","address":"209 6th Avenue E","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here a few years ago (2008?) for dinner with a group, so it may have changed since then. The service was bad despite there being a group of 10 of us with a reservation. The food was okay but a little odd and certainly eclectic, and for the small portions, it was a bit pricey for us students."},{"name":"La Hacienda Mexican Restaurant","address":"2260 S Volusia Ave","city":"Orange City","stars":"3.5","text":"Met some friends here for lunch one afternoon.  I am not from this area so it was nice that someone knew of a place to go.  Florida doesn't have a lot of \\"great\\" Mexican restaurants.  This one would be considered average back home.  Nothing really to write home about but not bad either.  Service was good and prices were decent.  I just had a tamal, cheese and ground beef enchiladas.  They were satisfactory.  Margaritas were good."},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Have been here for lunch and for dinner and both times everything was perfect. The servers are super friendly and helpful if you have any questions also they are happy to recommend and suggest options too. Neither time did we have to wait for a table. At lunch we orders arancini balls, pork meatballs, kale salad and the diavola pizza. Everything was delicious!! Really wished we had ordered more arancini balls they are flavoured with saffron which gives them a really different taste which i loved. When we came for dinner we say at the kitchen bar and watched the chefs in action, I definitely re commend you do this, these guys work together so well and are so quick it was amazing to watch! We had arancini balls, prosciutto salami plate, bruschetta, diavola and fungi pizza. Everything was delicious, the pizzas are to die for perfect crust perfect amount of topping! We finished off with a lemon meringue tart and an affogato, I had it with the custard gelato as recommended by the server...that gelato was amazing! The gelato and espresso came out at different times so our server gave it to me for free :) Love this place, highly recommended!!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Be warned they do not take credit cards but Voodoo Doughnuts is like a religious experience. Muslims go to Mecca, Catholics go to Vatican, Christians go to Jerusalem, Mormons Salt Lake, and all the cool kids go to Voodoo Doughnuts. When I first arrived in Portland I saw a line of people down the street and around the block. I later found out it was for voodoo doughnuts, the same place I was told was a \\"must-see\\" in Portland. I arrived around midnight. There was a line of about 60 people. I was like no way, any doughnut is this good. So I could say I did it I waited in line. It was a blast. The decoration inside were artsy and weird just like my beloved Portland. They had insane doughnuts every size, shape and flavor. They even had a monster doughnut as big as the head of the guy waiting on us. You have to try it. But we warned they do not take credit cards."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Perhaps the donuts aren't the best tasting, but the flavors were very creative and the vibe of the store was quirky and fun. It was cool to see all kinds of people stopping by Voodoo Doughnut in the middle of the day to get their sugar fix (men and women in business suits on their lunch breaks, a biking family, tourists/Portlandia fans like myself). \\n\\nThere isn't much street parking available but there are cheap lots all around the area.\\n\\nVoodoo Doughnut is also conveniently located across from the \\"Keep Portland Weird\\" sign!"},{"name":"Loyd Have Mercy","address":"3434 S Washington Ave","city":"Titusville","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is incredible. Every dish we tried was out of this world. The waitress was so sweet and brought us free samples of any item we weren't sure about, and Loyd himself came out and sat with is to welcome us and be sure we were enjoying our meal. They even brought out a free dessert for us to split, and we left with enough food to feed each of us for another two meals! Definitely the place to go if you're in the area!"},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place!! One of my favorite spots for ramen in the metro area. Hubby and I used to frequent so often that the hostess knew us.  \\nService is always excellent and timely.\\nI've only had the dumplings and bun as far as appetizers go and they're both a solid bet.\\nOn to the ramen! My favorites are the cha Cha Cha  and the tonkotsu black, both of which are garlic heavy. I've also had the ramen with brussel sprouts. The broth is Rich and multi layered and I like that Jinya does not skimp on the meat like some other ramen spots. \\nOverall, jinya is a solid spot for a casual date night, especially in the winter."},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place is a gem. The service was outstanding and the oysters were incredible. It has a family-owned small-town feeling. You walk in and feel at home as soon as you sit down. We ordered more shrimp because it was so good. 10/10 would recommend and it beats the prices anywhere else."},{"name":"Grass Fed","address":"605 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3","text":"They definitely put a lot of thought into the menu, and it shows.  I can honestly say that all of the \\"opening day drama\\" was immedietely forgiven once I had my first bite.  I can't wait to try everything else!\\n\\nThat being said, there needs to be a skinny railing or maybe some pub tables in the middle of the place.  I have no problem standing while I eat, but it is awkward and uncomfortable attempting to hold a beverage, a tray, and eat all without having anywhere to put things down and there is not much seating at all. There could definitely be some kind of surface space without impeding upon the flow of things."},{"name":"Kingmakers","address":"","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Fun place and a cool concept. Unfortunately our party had to wait almost an hour to get a table.  So either they need to expand to accommodate their popularity or set time limits on the tables. \\n\\nI also didn't love the cold ambience. I wasn't expecting the bright lights and big open room.  It almost felt like an unfinished basement.  This isn't like going to a coffee shop and sitting in big comfy chairs.  \\n\\nAt first you really have to ask yourself if it is worth paying $5 a person to go out to a place like this when you can just invite your friends over to your house. Most of the people there looked college age. Maybe they all live in dorms so going to a place like this is more convenient for them.  Granted, they do have a vast selection of games. Far more than the average person has.  But most of them I wouldn't want to play anyways.  A Battlestar Galactica game?  A Simpsons trivia game?  Don't get me wrong, I love the Simpsons, but my friends probably would not have known any trivia about the Simpsons.\\n\\nIt's nice that they have the snacks and bar. But I can't imagine anybody would go here for a typical \\"bar experience\\".  You know, the \\"lets get drunk, party, and find someone to flirt with\\" experience.  If you go here, you go here to play games with friends and maybe have a drink or two.  \\n\\nBut just because it's not a typical bar does not mean it isn't as loud as one. And this is my biggest complaint, as well as the biggest complaint from the group I was with: the place is LOUD.  If you want to try Kingmakers I would recommend finding out the slow hours and going then.  Perhaps they can decorate the walls with something to dampen the sound a little.  One friend said her throat was sore at the end of the night because she had to talk so loud over everyone else. \\n\\nI hope they succeed because it does seem like a nice getaway especially for a lot of younger, college age kids.  And it's something different, and probably better, than going out to a bar and getting hammered.  It's trendy, friendly, and fresh.  I would just recommend more space, less noise, and perhaps a different ambience."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the pisco sour, cusquena beer, palta rellena de cangrejo (crab stuffed avocado), anticucho de corazon (beef heart skewers), ceviche, seco de cordero (stewed lamb shank with canary beans) and arroz con pato (green rice and duck).\\n\\nEverything was amazing, the only thing I wouldn't order again was the duck (heavy on the citrus and very removed from the original Peruvian dish)\\n\\nWait staff was VERY knowledgable about the cuisine and history of it.

If I was only reviewing their poutine fries & bananas foster, they'd get a 5. Don't get me wrong, I can eat a Chicago style all day. But some of the other \\"artisan sausages\\" are...well, weird.

I tried going to Mary Mac's once before seeing a show at the Fox, but the wait completely deterred us (Almost 2 hours) and we ended up eating somewhere else. That being said I was really missing out on Mary Mac's. We went on a Friday for my birthday recently and had the best experience. We planned to get there right when they opened at 11 (I would recommend skipping breakfast as we did) and were greeted promptly at the door. As this was my first visit the waitress gave us a free pot likker with cornbread crackling - which was amazing. For our lunches we ordered Shrimp n' Grits with a side of fried okra and black-eyed peas, and Fried chicken with a side of fried okra and something else. I ordered the shrimp so was more focused on my plate . The Shrimp was cooked to perfection and the grits were the best I've had outside of my own home. There was so much leftover that we were able to eat off it for the next day and a half! The service was phenomenal, and I can't wait to go back and try something else!
