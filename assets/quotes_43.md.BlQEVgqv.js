I had a horrible case of food poisoning.  I was out of commission for 2.5 days and was not until just this morning that I was able to feel somewhat better.  I called and spoke to the hostess, Erin.  Informed her what happened and she told me she would get a manager.  I spoke to Vince, the manager, and am still in disbelief of our conversation.  First, he didn't even start off with an apology after I explained what happened to me.  Instead he goes right into his defense mode spiel and completely disregards what happened to me.  Then I think he realized he should be in somewhat customer service mode and then said sorry that I got sick but glad I'm all better now.  The conversation gets worse.  I informed him that I'm making this call to make sure no on else gets sick/food poisoning (I had some fish appetizer and a fish for my meal amongst other items there that evening).  He then continues on and on and again takes a defensive stance, and sounds like he is rushing me off the phone.  I informed him that no one is perfect and no place is perfect.  Mistakes happen.  Then he said he will look into it.  I then asked if he would be giving me a call back with an update.  He says if only a problem is found he would be getting back to me even though he never asked for my contact information.  He continues to sound like he wanted to hurry up and hang up... I then brought to his attention that he never asked me for my name or number.  Then he says well wouldn't it be under a reservation?  How on earth would you find my contact info amongst all the people that made a reservation?  Very disappointing.  He then goes on to say that he is not/they are not going to take responsibility for something that is not certain of someone getting food positioning.  Wow.  Am I not someone?  The lack of ownership and pretentious attitude of this place is really disappointing.  A genuine concern and apology of the customer should be top priority.  A sincere desire to really look into this so others won't feel as ill as I became should be the priority.  It sounded like Vince was more concerned about rushing through my phone call so that he could get back to his meeting.  Then without a good bye on his part he hangs up the call.  Sad.\\n\\nThere are way too many good restaurants in Atlanta that I would much prefer giving my business too.  Ones that care more about their returning customers than only thinking they are perfect.

It is always family style so coming here just with two of you like we did probably wasn't the smartest move in the world, because we just found ourselves with food envy looking around at the tables next to us not being able to order 4-5 things total including these amazing looking green beans that literally everyone ordered except for us. Talk about not feeling like the cool kid. But our spicy tofu dish was delicious and we found ourselves almost scraping the last bit of sauce out of that bowl it was so good.

The chips (french fries) are very good and so was the burger, salmon, and a salad, which were the entrees for my group of three.

Char Sui Bao was my gold standard, aged 3-5. ( Then my family moved to Boise. I don't think they had dim sum in Boise... so tragic. So my mom learned how to MAKE char sui bao. Herself. They rocked. ). \\n\\nAnyway, Back to Wong's King. \\n\\nPsych! I'ts CLOSED. As in GONE. KAPUT. \\n\\nSigh. I really wanted some wonton soup. \\n\\nScrambling for an idea, we went to Jin Wah. They have dimsum. Right? \\n\\nPlus, I wasn't with my husband. He thinks Jin Wah isn't as clean as some other places we eat. He had a problem with his water glass last time, it had finger prints and floaties. But that's been a while back. \\n\\nSo, Jin Wah it was. . \\n\\nWe had tea,  pork shumai ( good- we ate two plates of those), egg rolls ( greasy), steamed shrimp dumplings ( salty, a little gummy), char siu bao ( steamed and baked , neither as good as Wong's King, and not as good as Uwajimaya-- more curry flavored than five spice flavored like typical char siu bao), shrimp rice balls ( good), sticky rice in a big green leaf ( I didn't eat that, my friend did, I didn't know what was inside... maybe some beef?my friend liked them), and some little shrimp and vegetable steamed dumplings with greens in them. I liked them, but they were briny. \\n\\nTotal was about $30. The service was odd. The guy saw me looking around and said \\" what you looking for!?\\" I think he was trying to be helpful but it was kind of brusque and barky... and then at the end he said \\"how many you eat? ten? twenty? need more?\\" which I thought was a comment on my somewhat rounded shape... made me feel a little grumpy. I didn't eat ten or twenty, BTW. \\n\\nI dunno. Maybe it was okay, it was acceptable, but it wasn't Wong's King.

I absolutely love the avocado salad, the \\"sushi pizza\\" (I forgot what they call it, just try it!) and the spicy yellowtail maki. Oga's uses a different spicy mayo than other restaurants and I cannot find anything close to it in other restaurants. Nigiri sushi has the perfect rice and proportions and is always fresh. Specials can be had upon request. Full bar, very good list of excellent sakes, and an extensive menu of Japanese foods for those who don't get crazy over sushi or sashimi. Try the green tea or sesame ice creams, if you have never, it's an interesting experience.

Here's my take on the experience.\\n\\nShiki gets a solid 4 stars for food and 3 stars for service. I'd actually give the place 3.5 stars, but would rather go down half a star than up. I prefer not to dwell on the negative so I'll get the service part out of the way first. I reserved a table for 6 more than a week in advance and it was clear when we got there that they'd either forgotten the reservation or given the table away to a party not yet done. Normally, I could overlook this, but this was a special occasion and I was therefore disappointed from the start. There was not even an apology from the staff even though it was clear they knew they had made a mistake.\\n\\nAs well, the service was slow (the food came out at uneven paces--sometimes quick, often times slow) and it took forever for our bill to be calculated. Yes, Friday nights ARE busy nights for most restaurants. That is no excuse for poor service. Minus points for that.\\n\\nOn to the more positive aspect: the food. I don't think Shiki is capable of making a bad dish, but probably because I've had real, authentic Japanese small plates by acclaimed Japanese chefs, I thoroughly enjoyed the food but was not blown away by it.\\n\\nMy favorite dishes were the sunomono combo (thank you Dorise for picking this), the halibut carpaccio (I just love anything carpaccio), fatty yellowtail (I am obsessed with yellowtail, as other reviews will attest) and the beef tataki (thank you HD for this choice). The natural, savory flavors of each fish and meat were brought out perfectly and wonderfully balanced with accompanying sauces. \\n\\nThe most surprising delight of the night was definitely the grilled eggplant. Like Fermina Daza in \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\", I detest eggplant but was amazed by how good this dish was. I think the delicious yellow sauce had a lot to do with it.\\n\\nIf you get the ice-cream, make sure to ask for mango no matter what other flavors you try. The mango is more like a melted sorbet but thicker, more sauce-like, and was added to each flavor we tried like a topping. It was delectable.\\n\\nOn food alone, I would consider coming back here again for more small plates. But if I factor in service as well, I would not come back here of my own volition and would probably only come back for someone else's special occasion (e.g. birthday, wedding). I don't think there should have to be a trade-off between delicious Japanese food and good, efficient service."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great service, fresh food, joyful atmosphere.

They only have 4 people working in this entire restaraunt: 1 in the kitchen, 1 at the sushi bar, 2 serving.  The older lady who works there (I believe the owner as well) is very kind and patient.  The younger girl working there though, is rude as hell.  If she wasn't a relative or a family friend of the owner, she would have been let go for sure.  When we needed her service, she would look at us and just walk away never to come back.  When we did grab her attention, she would put up her hand to us and walk off in the midst of us talking to her.  We asked her for the menu a few times and it took her a good 20 minutes to give it to us.  For that, I will easily choose Matsuyama for some late night eats next time around."},{"name":"Trackside Tavern","address":"313 E College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"A nice around the corner bar.

The first time for drinks and dessert.  I had a chocolate cake that was extremely rich, perhaps richer than I would like, but that's a weird personal preference.  I don't think I can really complain that the chocolate cake was too chocolaty.  The cocktails were delicious and perfectly strong.  \\n\\nI recently returned with a group of 6 for a late dinner.  I should note, I was ordering dinner, but in the group, two people ordered smaller plates, and two ordered desserts.  The server did seem to let us know that she was going out of her way to accomodate our unusual orders, but the food all came out at roughly the same time at the right temperature. \\n\\nThe food:  AMAZING.  I had the gnocci with the ragu and then the Lamb.  I have zero complaints about either dish.  The gnocci was as Gnocci should be- tender with a great crunchier contrast from the veal sauce.  It was flavorful and light.  One person in the group ordered it as his entree, and I thnk he was pretty disappointed at it's size, but it was a medium sized plate, so he probably shouldn't have expected an Olive Garden sized plate of pasta.  \\n\\nNow, on to the lamb.  I've only recently moved to Atlanta, and I can say that this dish was by the best plate I've had here.  I can't stop gushing over how perfect it was.  The lamb was cooked to perfection.  So tender and moist.  It came with a sideof fregula, brussel sprouts, beets and kale, I believe.  I'm not sure which was better, the sides or the lamb.  I savoured every bite.  I literally asked my bf if we could go back as we walked to our car.  Amazing dish.  \\n\\nSo, \\n\\nPros: The food, the food, the food.  Also, the ambience is lovely.  \\n\\nCons: the general snootiness of the place.

Admittedly, I wasn't too enthused about going because I was set on trying Craft Atlanta since my L.A. experience was so good. However, I did have high hopes because of the rave reviews I read on yelp.\\n\\nThis place is not terrible but the 2-Star rating pretty much hits the nail on the head: \\"Meh. I've experienced better.\\"\\n\\nWhat I ate:\\n\\nEscargots 'en croute' -- The escargot was my favorite of the three because it's difficult to mess up tons of butter, garlic, & snails, but I wouldn't even rank it in the top 10 escargot dishes I've had (although, it's leaps & bounds better than the escargot served by Alex Reznik at Ivan Kane's Cafe Was). The escargot dish is not covered in a puff pastry and then baked, instead, each serving has a tiny little puff pastry on it. Boo.\\n\\nTartare de boeuf -- this dish was so underwhelming that there's really nothing to write about. There was no flavor (not even notes or hints) to describe the experience. Plainly, this was milquetoast. Skip this and order a glass of wine or something instead.\\n\\nMoules 'Gilbert' -- I must preface this by saying that I am not a fan of mussels. I ordered them simply because my best friend highly recommended them. Again, I was underwhelmed. I felt that the \\"sauce\\" it was steamed in was too salty and lacked any sophisticated mix of flavors. I tasted salt & butter. Again, both things I love...but I can get that sort of thing at Cracker Barrel.\\n\\nTruite mi fume amandine -- my sister order this GA trout dish which actually looked quite lovely and smelled uniquely savory with a hint of smoke. The skin looked to be just crispy enough and the fish itself was slightly buttery and even less flaky. However, it was undercooked and she was immediately turned off by it. She didn't even send it back, her appetite was gone.\\n\\nTournedos au poivre -- my tenderloin was thoroughly overcooked even though I had an extensive conversation with our server about how I enjoy my steak just shy of rare. The flavor, if I had to use a single word to use, was salty....again. All in all, I would've preferred to have the trout as opposed to the beef tenderloin. \\n\\nAlthough I love creme brulee and thought I'd try it here, I was so disappointed in everything that I had tried that I just asked for the check and skipped dessert.\\n\\nThe Interior:\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is actually quite beautiful. It has a manufactured charm to it but if you have enough of a buzz, there's a really nice vibe in there. My favorite part is the exposed kitchen in the front and the tiny little oyster display. That portion of the restaurant is covered in white tile and I love that look. It reminds a bit of Lobster Bar. \\n\\nThe food is not \\"terrible\\" but I would never recommend it to a 'foodie.' At the risk of sounding pretentious, you may enjoy the food here if you haven't experienced authentic French cuisine but to me this was like the Cheesecake Factory version of French Laundry.\\n\\nThe price, if you enjoy what you're eating, is very reasonable. Although I, personally, feel like I didn't get what I paid for, I recognize that the ingredients they're using are priced appropriately.\\n\\nI may (emphasis) return here to drink some wine on the patio but I certainly won't be ordering anything from the kitchen again.\\n\\nNOTE: I don't know if this was a one-time thing or a perpetual issue but today, 8/15/10, the restaurant was literally infested with fruit flies. More than anything, it was just really annoying. Our server apologized about the issue and said they were trying to \\"take care of it\\" but I didn't expect anything more than an acknowledgment that there were a bunch of fruit flies around.

Actually it was our third. The first 2 times were for appies and drinks and we had a great time. We thought the food was good for what it was and the drink selection was enjoyable. The 3rd time was a couple of weeks ago and we went there for lunch for a friend's birthday. We were very disappointed. We ordered their combos for $10+ each plus some specialty rolls. The first few dishes arrived and we thought they were alright and were actually enjoying our meal. At this point though we realized that no one has come back to refill any of our drinks and clear away any empty dishes. In fact since there were 6 of us, quite a few dishes have piled up and we have resorted to placing it on one of the ledges in between the booths as it was getting pretty crowded at our table. I'm surprised because the restuarant was not full at all and there were only a few tables occupied.\\n\\nThen came my friend's chicken yakisoba order. She stopped after having 2 bites and said that her chicken tasted old and her noodles tasted spoiled. She asked us to taste it just in case it must be just her. We did, and yes the chicken tasted as if it had been sitting out for a while as it had that off tatse and the noodles tasted sour. We called the waitress and my friend told her about her concerns. She said she will bring it to the chef's attention. Our server then came back and told us that the chef said there was nothing wrong with it. She was very argumentative. That was the only time our server ever came back to our table, not to replenish our drinks or clear away empty dishes but to argue. How appalling!\\n\\nMy friend's husband even spoke with the manager on the way out about the whole incident and he was defensive and not apologetic at all. Sure, they did not make her pay for her meal but that did not make up for the lack of professionalism from this restaurant's staff.

I thought that the \\"vegan burger\\" would be a safe choice for a light lunch, but what I got was a deep fried/battered thing that bore no semblance to a veggie burger. I sent it back since nowhere on the menu did it say that the burger would be friend. I asked them just to bake or microwave it, but they seemed to find this distressing. So I got the turkey burger ... which was smothered with a puke-colored mayonnaise sauce and lots of cheese ... Again, based on the menu this was not what I was suspecting.

I went with two of my roommates and it was our first time. We were all pleasantly surprised. I would definitely go back!"},{"name":"Flying Saucer Draught Emporium","address":"815 W 47th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't think any bar in Austin could possibly compete with the beer selection at the Flying Saucer. There are a huge number of beers on tap, including less common varieties like lambics and Trappist ales. My friends who are on gluten free diets like it when we go to the Flying Saucer because there are always several gluten free beers on the menu in addition to all of the ciders they have. The beers and ciders on tap rotate regularly, too, so even if you're going every week, you should still find something new to try every time. For non-drinkers, there are various root beers available by the bottle, or you can always order a fountain soda. Just don't come looking for Bud Light.\\n\\nThe food is not amazing, but it's better than average for a bar. There is also a much larger selection than a typical bar. Snacks you won't find everwhere include chips and queso, bread pretzels, and cheese-filled tater tots called Rocket Tots. The food ranges from greasy stuff like pizza and burgers to healthier sandwich and wrap options. The Flying Saucer is a great option for lunch because it's never crowded at that time of day, there's enough choices to make everyone happy, and they have well priced specials for the Triangle. But people definitely come for the beer more than the food.\\n\\nSeating options are nice and varied. While the inside is mostly tables and booths, there is also a bar and some comfy couch space if you can get it. Outside, there are plenty of picnic tables with benches, plus an open area with cushioned seating that is great for big groups when the weather allows it. Usually I prefer a table inside, but outside is great when it's not summer.\\n\\nThe Flying Saucer is a great place to have a conversation because I never find myself having to shout to talk to other people. It's a good choice for large groups (I have come in with 15 people before), but not every night. In addition to Friday and Saturday as you might expect for a bar, Tuesdays are very crowded because of trivia, and Wednesdays are usually crowded as well because they give out a glass every Wednesday. I never have trouble on Sundays, Mondays, or Thursdays, though.  Hopefully they'll expand the bar someday.\\n\\nI'm always happy with the service. The bartenders and servers are friendly, and they know their beer very well. I don't know what training they give these girls, but it's very effective. If you're having trouble making up your mind, they can always make a recommendation for you if you give them some idea of what you're in the mood for.\\n\\nThere are a few TVs in the place with sports on them, but this is definitely not a sports bar. It's hard to get a seat with an angle that is good for watching the whole game, but if you just want to watch key plays and keep up with the score, you shouldn't have any trouble doing so. As far as games go, they have a couple of dart boards, and that's it. I've never had to wait on darts when I want to play because most people go to try new beers and enjoy the company of their friends.\\n\\nThe big thing that sets the Flying Saucer apart, which is also the thing that keeps me coming back aside from the selection, is the UFO Club. Club membership is a one-time fee (only $15 or $20 when I signed up), and it comes with a T-shirt and membership card. With the card, they will actually keep track of all the different beers that you drink there, and every 50 unique beers gets you a reward. At 200, you get a $100 tab for a party where they unveil a plate on the wall with your name on it and whatever quote you want. This loyalty program is a fun challenge that other bars can't beat.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place to get a good beer, eat some decent food, keep up with the score of the game, or have an engaging conversation with friends, the Flying Saucer is an excellent choice. If you want to drink Bud Light, listen to deafening music, shoot pool, dance, watch every play of the game, or get obnoxiously drunk, this is not the place for that. I enjoy the Flying Saucer very much, though, and I tend to go once a week even though I live up north."},{"name":"Bouchee","address":"159 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We went here for a late lunch and had the onion soup, and shared the turkey/cranberry sandwich and the bleu cheeseburger.

The pizza is my favorite item at Bertucci's, but today I ordered the unlimited soup/salad lunch special.  This is offered every day at lunchtime and for $8.49, it is a great deal.  The service was prompt even though my server was doing double duty as the bartender.  I had a bowl of salad and a bowl of the sausage soup.  The salad was decent, but the soup was less impressive than I remember in the past.  With sausage, rice, tomatoes, and spinach, it has the ingredients of a soup I would love.  However, it was rather bland.  I would get this lunch special again, but perhaps try one of the other soups such as the minestrone."},{"name":"The Hawthorne","address":"500A Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Just moved to Boston and can definitely say we will be back to jackson cannon.

The yellow rice we all had was really great but the steamed cabbage could have been steamed a bit longer because it was still hard. My biggest complaint is the lack of vegetable choices, things that are on their online menu are not to be found on the restaurant menu an example is collard greens.

The 1st time I ever came, I sat in the VIP and had great service, but this time, for the Angie Stone concert on 04/12 at 7pm, since I came solo, I sat in the cheaper seats towards the back. Still a great view, however the service was subpar. The waitress never brought my order, even after those around me that ordered after, had gotten their food. When I asked for a cocktail menu, she said they didn't have one and just said \\"basic cocktails\\"...so I had to say the 1st thing that came to mind, instead of feeling like I truly had a choice. When I finally flagged a waitress down to ask about my food, she happened to have what I wanted in her hand, but made it as if that wasn't technically my order, but meant for someone else, then apologized and said she'd take 20% off my order. The duck tacos were great, the meant and slaw that it came with anyways...the tortillas were fully cooked or warmed up correctly so they broke in pieces when folded, resulting in very messy tacos. At the end of the show, they took forever to bring the check, even as we were getting ushered out so they could set up for the next show. When the check finally came, they had never taken off the 20% as promised. Also, the concert never even started until after 740, even though it said seating started at 6 and the show started at 7.

We sat there in the daze looking at the cooks working in the exposed kitchen area and the eclectic decorations. Then we noticed the handwritten sign that said we needed to order at the register.

We're were 5th on the order ticket bar and counted down as our ticket crept to the front of the line. BOOM! The server flipped around and the food started coming. The Bombers were HUGE bread boats of meaty, cheesy and sweet pepper goodness. It was embarrassing making yummy sounds with each bite. The fries were good and crispy outside with fluffy 'fry guts' on the inside. Their housemade chips were thin, crispy and not typically disappointing pub made chips.

There has been a lot of research on the medical benefits of broth, and for a long time broth was simply what was left over after you cooked the food. That's a topic unto itself, but kudos to Dai Due for bringing broth to the forefront. \\n\\nWe walked in past the butcher counter, which inexplicably is also a bakery/butcher shop (?). In any event, we walked in and my wife spotted a xihuacan cheese croissant, which was mind-blowing. Our table of four quickly devoured it, and attempted to order another one, only to find they were sold out. Boo.\\n\\nI can heartily recommend the cemita ahogada. I handily won \\"meal roulette\\" with that dish, despite not knowing exactly what I was ordering. Basically it's a carnitas sandwich, cut in half, with both halves face down in a bit of broth. And that broth, oh that broth...it might be the most intriguing, complex broth I've ever had. Hearty and sweet gives way to just the right amount of heat with a slight, slight sour finish. It reminded me a bit of Pinkberry, oddly enough, where you have the first bite and ask yourself \\"Do I like this?\\" Only to find, five minutes later, that the entire bowl is gone. \\n\\nSpeaking of sour notes... The bacon manages to be limp, despite being thick cut and burnt to a crisp. We ordered a table pancake, which turns out to be a gigantic, puffy, disappointing dough disc. One \\"pancake\\" is more than enough for a table of four. If you mix the fruit in and just eat the perimeter it's crispy and decently flavored. But the center mass, the bulk of the pancake, is dense, doughy and flavorless.\\n\\nOur friend ordered the CenTex breakfast, which seemed like the traditional eggs/grits/toast that you can find anywhere. His comment? \\"It's what you would expect.\\" For $15, I'd expect a little bit more. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the sweet potato sope, which she liked, but to be honest, she was eyeing my ahogada the entire time. It's clear that Dai Due doesn't have their liquor license, but they make up for it with a pretty expansive beer and wine selection. I'm not a wine guy, so I can't speak to that part of the menu, but the beer selection is...odd. It's heavily stacked with porters and stouts, which seems an odd pairing. When I'm having my heavy meat and soup entree, I don't want an equally heavy beer. To be fair, there are a few ales and even a saison or two in there, but I'd think you'd want to be heavy on the IPAs here to balance out the dishes. They do offer very large serving (1Litre !!) table beers, which is a pretty great concept that I've not seen executed anywhere else....or maybe it's just a clever re-branding of a pitcher of beer. \\n\\nWould I come back? Eh, maybe. At least for brunch, the menu isn't innovative enough to make me a a regular, though I know they rotate their offerings with the seasons, so this would be a place to hit up two or three times a year, just to see what they're offering up."},{"name":"OSAKA Japanese Sushi & Steak House","address":"14 Green St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Very good Hibachi Japanese place!!

Prior to an event we were going to head to, we decided to step our pregame up at The Original Dinerant. With that said, let it be known that this review is specifically on the customer experience since I didn't eat anything at this establishment. Our bartender, Elliot, is just a cool AF human being and deserves the shoutout. \\n\\nWhen my sister and I sat at the bar, I asked for a round of Jameson shots with ginger backs... to which he replied, \\"ginger ale or ginger beer?\\" Well, this totally caught me by surprise. Did I want to ease into a fun night with the ginger ale or go big or go home with the ginger beer? Either way, it was the perfect ice breaker that led us to building rapport with Elliot. He was very personable, friendly, and knowledgeable of the nightlife scene in downtown Portland. Elliot gave us tips on bars and lounges to check out in the area as well as late night eats for the drunk munchies. Furthermore, I found that he was attentive to all the patrons at the bar despite being the only bartender that night (we were there around 10:30p on Black Friday).

It's unfortunate we had that issue with our server during our initial visit because everyone else is pretty great here. The manager, Deon, took the time to reach out to me and apologize about the incident that happened previously. As a business owner myself, I can appreciate that he was able to set what I had to say aside and invite me back for dinner.\\n\\nWe came on a Tuesday night around 6pm. The restaurant was pretty full but he was able to seat us at a booth right away. Menus and waters were given to us almost immediately, and there were about 3 servers total that were helping us. We ordered 2 hot sakes, the original beef short ribs, mango paradise roll, and bc blazer roll. The short ribs were already pre-cooked and marinated, but they serve it with a mini (stone?) grill so you can char it to your liking. The portion was generous and it was well flavored. Granted, it's not as good as it would be from an authentic Korean BBQ place, but for a Japanese restaurant I'd say I was pretty impressed. The pieces of meat had little to no fat on it, it was really tender, and had enough in the serving to feed 2 people as an appetizer. I didn't try the rolls but my husband scarfed them down so I assume he enjoyed them. They were beautifully made and plated.\\n\\nAfter dinner they teased us with desserts, which we couldn't resist. I don't remember what it was called, but it was a dessert that was made to look like sushi, except it was deep fried banana served with chocolate drizzle, red bean, matcha green tea and mango ice cream. SO good. I wasn't too much a fan of the red bean, but they plate it so that you can easily remove it if you don't like it. \\n\\nOverall, the service was top notch. All of our servers were so friendly, always came to check on us, and we were just well taken care of. We had a little talk with Deon after our meal which was nice, and we thanked him again for inviting us back. I learned a lot from this experience with Yelp, and that it's not really fair to judge a place so harshly based on the actions of 1 person. I think from now on I'll be able to write Yelp reviews on a less emotional based standpoint and give each business a fair review based on the experience as a whole. Thanks Ebisu for a great dining experience! I'll be back next year. :)"},{"name":"Kaya Restaurant","address":"1924 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"When I first moved to Somerville many years ago, I remember noting that Kaya was open pretty much all the time; from lunch hour to super late on weekdays as well as weekends.

But over the years, Kaya has come to be a steady friend... the food quite good enough (their sauteed ginkonuts are *great*, their agedashi-dofu also excellent, and their gobdol bibimbop is wonderful wintertime comfort-food)... their sushi has never been less than fresh and their Korean barbeque is tasty and fun to enjoy with a group.

This time we ate in - it was empty other than one other table.  Both of us ordered the lunch special which was a ginger salad and 2 sushi rolls for $12.99 (I think it was).  Salads were good.  I ordered 2 rolls, Spicy Tuna and Salmon Crunch, i think it was and they were decent - nothing spectacular.  My daughter ordered the Tokyo and Philly rolls.  While The Philly was okay (i am not a fan of smoke flavoring at all), the Tokyo was not.  She made me have a bite of each after her first taste since she was a bit shocked - unfortunately i did not know why until after i had put the Tokyo bite in my mouth.  Who ever thought the curry flavor would in the least bit good should be hurt.   While I wanted to spit it out, there was no place to do this.  The crunch in it made it that much more unnerving; i can't believe the crunch was from the cucumber, but quite honestly i do not want to know WHAT it was.  We could not eat the roll.  \\n\\nService was nice and efficient.    I got our bill and when we were asked if we wanted to take it home we said no - and i explained we did not care for it at all.  The server promptly returned and appropriated asked if we wanted another roll in place of it and responded no thank you.        \\n\\nWe left and went to Publix to pick up a few things and throughout i felt HORRIBLE - quite honestly the flavor would not get out of my body.  Fortunately I was able to throw up since it wanted out of my body desperately.  After this and about 20 minutes, i returned to normal.   \\n\\nI really don't mean to bash, but it was just not good. . . . specifically the Tokyo roll - nor really was the Philly roll - in OUR opinion.

At that point I felt like a retard, thanks. You don't really have a dedicated server so its very inconsistent. One took our drinks order, one took our food order, one brought the food, one blowtorched our roll... One particular visit I complained to one about the noise level. I don't know about you but I normally pick a Japanese restaurant because you can have a conversation while sipping sake and eating sushi. This one particular visit, the Canucks game on TV started while we were there. They cranked the volume full blast so my friend and I had to yell at each other from across the small table. Contrary to popular belief, not everyone is into the Canucks in Vancouver, and if I wanted to watch hockey loudly I would have gone to a pub, it was even louder than a pub. Perhaps because we were seated right under a speaker, we kindly asked if they could turn it down to an acceptable level, they downright said \\"no, other customers want it this way.\\" It was full on loud even during commercial breaks on their TV.

I should have thought of that before telling her. My husband took a bite and said it was fine. But she told me that regardless of the reason, she wanted me to leave full and happy and offered me another protein (since I wasn't giving up my sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts!) and I chose a fried chicken breast. This was the tastiest, lightest chicken breast I have ever eaten and I was totally happy! What made me happiest, however, was the Candied Bacon Butternut Squash Soup! OMG!

The kind way your manager handled someone with a complaint, even possibly an unfounded one, has caused us to want to return.

That's okay, but wish she would have offered to find out for me instead of just saying she didn't know.  She admitted she doesn't cook herself so that may be why.

The lobster roll was brimming with lobster, and though it was quite large, the light and refreshing nature of the sauce allowed to enjoy each bite.  The clam chowder was delicious, creamy and with numerous clams. I also had some of my parents' Steamed Lobster and Corn combo ($18).  It was just a medium sized steamed lobster with a side of butter sauce for dipping - nothing terribly special, but I suppose its just one of those things that tourists like us must get while in Boston. \\n\\nAmbiance: (5/5) I came here on a Thursday morning around 10:30am and the place was brimming with tourists already - the entire long hallway flanked with food stalls and both levels of dining areas in the center of the building.

Even my mom became fascinated with the sweets here and, as excited as a kid of Christmas morning, kept running off to take pictures of monstrous cookies and brightly colored cakes.

A warm glow, with the ambiance of both an old steakhouse and a British pub.\\n\\nThey were severely understaffed on the Sunday night my husband and I went, so I do not feel it fair to rate the table service, other than they were friendly enough. But it left me curious to know how attentive they would have been with an adequate number of servers.  This is the first time we sat at a table and ordered a full dinner. Typically, we sit at the bar where the bartenders are consistently indifferent and impersonal, but make enticingly complicated drinks.\\n\\nFirst off, the Bufala Negra is one of the best cocktails in Atlanta! Basil, in a drink, will delight me every time. Keep in mind, waiting for your drink definitely requires patience. They hand craft every cocktail and I understand the pace, but am less sympathetic with the delay in pouring wine.  \\n\\nWe ordered the three-course Sunday Supper. The first course being clams casino. It was good, but didn't wow me. For my entr√©e, I chose the pork schnitzel and the husband had shrimp and grits. Both were delicious. The schnitzel was crispy, just the way I like it. What did wow me was the saut√©ed spaetzle. These light and heavenly egg noodles are a rare find on Atlanta menus. The shrimp and grits were garlicky and cheesy with a smoky sauce on top. For $20 per person, the Sunday Supper is a great value and a good chance to taste items that may not typically be on the menu. We also tried  the pimento cheese as an additional appetizer. It was  served differently than prior visits (in a glass with celery, carrots and bead crisps). This time it was on the bread crisps and had a smoky flavor, though perhaps it was the tiny piece of pickled cauliflower on top. Funky looking, but added a nice zest.\\n\\nApparently, they ran out of the sorghum cookies that they usually serve with the dinner. So, we were given a chocolate cake with, the very best part---- salted caramel ice cream. Whoa! I do not have much of a sweet tooth, so it takes a lot to make me indulge. It was so outstanding, that the chocolate cake was simply treated as a garnish. \\n\\nIf I lived closer, this would definitely be one of my weekly hangouts!"},{"name":"The Taco Stand","address":"3279 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"4 stars for convenience.

We chose the Chef's 5 course tasting menu, which included huge perfectly seared, crispy outside, sea scallops (which I will go back for anytime). The escarole salad, with poached pear puree, goat cheese, candied walnuts and a garlicky creme fraiche dressing was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. While I'm not usually a fan of risotto because most chef's make it too bland, the Grilled Walu (perfectly cooked) with wild mushroom risotto left me wanting more. Thankfully, there wasn't more because the next course was again, a perfectly cooked roasted duck breast on braised cabbage with apple/walnut salad. The presentation of each plate was elegant and colorful, which describes the flourless chocolate cake. I agree with others, even though I was full, it was lick the plate good!\\n\\nThe service:The bread server and the table bussers were right on-the waitress-a bit ditzy.

I came up to Boston for the weekend to spend time with my brother and sister who I hardly ever get to see anymore.  After seeing a show in the Wilbur Theater, we came to Sweetwater Tavern.  \\nThis allowed me just enough time to order 1 drink, go to the bathroom, and be escorted out.  At first I thought the bouncer was showing me where the bathroom was because I had trouble finding it, but instead he was bringing me outside.  My cell phone, jacket, and family were all still inside.  The bouncer said he kicked me out because I was trying to get into an employee only area.  I asked why he couldn't have just shown me where the bathroom was and he said I was too drunk and couldn't come back in.  I wasn't starting fights, I wasn't falling-down drunk, I wasn't causing problems, I just couldn't find the bathroom.  The bouncer said his name was John, although I doubt that's actually his name.\\nAfter about 30 minutes my boyfriend realized I was missing (he tried calling me but my phone was in the bar and the bouncer wouldn't let me get it) so he searched the bar for me, and started searching the alley.  When he tried to re-enter the bar to tell my brother and sister that I was outside, the bouncers wouldn't let him in either!  What was their reason this time?  They claimed to be at capacity, while they proceeded to let other people in the bar.  They later told him that they wouldn't let him back in because he left.  I'm still trying to figure that one out.\\nThe only way I was able to get the message to my siblings was through a friend of ours who came out to meet up with us (luckily, they let her in, probably just to collect her cover charge and kick her out later). By this time, (about an hour after I was kicked out), my sister and her husband had to leave because they told the babysitter they'd be back by a certain time.  \\nSo, I'm out $200 for a round-trip plane ticket, $80 Northface Jacket with a $200 digital camera in the pocket that was never recovered, and a night that should be a fond memory of time spent with my family and friends.

Mind you, I had no idea that Portland is apparently the home of some of the best/most eclectic food trucks in the country, otherwise I would have gone in search of a good truck. Instead, we simply got off of the highway and pulled into Newport Seafood Grill.\\n\\nThe facilities and service were both very good. Of course, when I start a review by complimenting those two things first, you know I'm grasping at straws in trying to come up with some positive features about the restaurant. I shared a bowl of the Classic New England Clam Chowder with my brother. The soup was on the thin side and was pretty skimpy with regards to the claims. All I kept digging out were potatoes, which is pretty lame. As for my entr√©e of Seafood Paella, please remind me to never, ever get paella at a non-Spanish restaurant. I have no idea what compelled me to order seafood paella at a chain seafood restaurant in Oregon, but it was a terrible decision. What I got was a dish that was nothing close to resembling traditional Spanish paella, as there was absolutely no crusty rice, which I consider essential to any paella dish (and it's the best part, too). The dish supposedly came with saffron rice, but it was probably just food coloring, as I didn't get any hint of saffron flavor at all. The chicken, sausage, and seafood tasted okay, albeit a bit bland, and the asparagus felt out of place. Just from the way the dish was composed, it felt much more like a jambalaya than a paella, though it was faithful to neither of these two great dishes. \\n\\nDuring my family's eight day road trip from Phoenix to Vancouver, this was likely the most disappointing meal.

It's their second night open and there was a large crowd, so I am giving Banger's the benefit of the doubt. \\n\\nThe facility itself is great. It's huge, there is a large stage, they play fun music, and it's got the most amazing tap wall I've ever seen. The outdoor patio area is huge - there are a ton of places to sit. Best of all, they have a little fenced dog play area. I agree with Chiqui B that the addition of fans on the patio would be an instant win. Inside the restaurant is nicely decorated, but it can get crazy loud here. We ended up migrating outside when it became too difficult to talk.\\n\\nThe food was excellent. I ordered the veggie chicken cheese steak sausage with the pretzel bun, spicy sauerkraut, sweet mustard, and onions. It was fairly incredible. The spicy sauerkraut was fantastic and really spicy in a good way. The fried pickles were also excellent. From the breading on the pickles to the three types of aioli sauce, pretty much everything on the food menu is made in house. There are plenty of options for the vegetarians out there. They did run out of food on a few items, but I imagine that kink will be fixed shortly. For dessert we had the Snickers Ice Cream Bar in a Jar. It was fantastic - fresh chocolate sauce and crunchy boiled peanuts, yum! They have sausages for your dog as well.\\n\\nThe menus can be a bit overwhelming. There are literally hundreds of combinations of sausages that you could go with. Same with the beer menu - over 100 beers is a bit overwhelming at times. The servers did not seem to be knowledgeable about most of the beers and sausages. I'm assuming that will also be fixed in time.\\n\\nThe beer menu was excellent. They have a very good variety of different beers - both imported, domestic, and local Texas craft breweries. There is something for everyone. I was not a fan of the Duchesse De Bourgogne (it's slightly sour and really sweet/fruity), but I loved my Adelbert's Naked Nun. \\n\\nSo, why the three stars? Service. We were sat immediately as we came in and for the first 20 minutes of our 2+ hour adventure we had great service. The following hour and 40 minutes was a whole different story. After we placed the order for our food, our waiter essentially disappeared. Not just for us, but for everyone at our table. After waiting over 20 minutes for our waiter to come around to take our second drink order, I was pretty fed up. 20 minutes later when I didn't have my beer or dessert yet, I was even more fed up. We moved outside at some point and closed out with a different waitress, which was a debacle in itself as well. It took us over 30 minutes to settle up and close out. It wasn't just us who were ready to throw a fit, we saw a waitress leave during the middle of a guy ordering his meal and not return for over 10 minutes. Service was not acceptable in the least.\\n\\nAll that being said, I am willing to give it another shot because the product (food & beers) are excellent.

It is a quality item. You feel the crispy layers as you take your first bite & then you'll want to have another one.. or two... SO GOOD. Don't skip this one! You'll regret it. \\n- Tomato basil pot pie- refreshing tomato basil combo with a buttery golden top. Delicious!  \\n- Biscuits & gravy- the biscuits were soft & fluffy with a nice crunch on the outside. \\n- Green Chile pork & eggs - yum. Creative & delicious. Succulent pork pieces & who can say no to green chili? \\n\\nEverything else was good as well, but I didn't particularly go for seconds on any of them due to my limited stomach size.  \\n\\nWhat was great about this brunch buffet?\\n1) Service- friendly servers, and other kitchen staff who were constantly cleaning & making sure their customers were satisfied. \\n2) Fresh food- they were constantly switching out the hot pans with fresh new pans of food (& didn't scrape the leftovers of the old pan back in). Even the last 30  minutes of the brunch buffet, they were STILL bringing out hot piping food from the kitchen when there were only a few ppl eating. It shows how they value each one of their customers & want to provide quality food over just saving their bottom line by letting the last customers eat the leftovers. \\n\\nWhat could've been better?\\n- I called & made a reservation & they couldn't find it on Sunday. I know I called this Jack Allen's b/c I double-checked the number to make sure it wasn't the Round Rock one. And when I was making the reservation, the lady I talked to was busy laughing and sounded distracted, so I'm sure that played a part in the mix-up. \\n\\nTips: \\n-Go early or go late to avoid waiting in a 1 hour line. \\n-Parking is available at the business building next to Sonic on Sundays. \\n- Many of the items were  HEAVY-- like fried or creamy or cheesy or full of carbs, so do pace yourself & get extra-small portions if you want to try everything.  \\n- Share plate of silver dollar pancakes & biscuits and gravy with everyone else at your table. Don't order eggs until you've gone to the buffet & then see if you even have stomach space left (we didn't)."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing selection of fresh produce and restaurants.

Certainly, there will always be hits and misses with the various dishes; a good experience is marked by the food meeting one's expectations (or what one thinks it should taste like!). \\n\\nFor us, the would-order again list include:\\n1) Freshly made hot Soy bean milk (you can ask them to serve it plain without sugar). \\n2) Soy bean custard with ginger syrup - the texture was very smooth and soft and the syrup was not too sweet, and had a very pleasant ginger smell\\n3) steamed pork bun - this is a big pork bun that tastes savory and sweet at the same time\\n4) tofu noodles cold plate - this was a little salty but still refreshing like a salad as the noodles were mixed with some celery greens and carrot garnishing\\n5) taro custard - Yum! I haven't found this in downtown boston chinatown so I was happy to find it here. The texture was very smooth and it wasn't coated with heaps of oil. This is the filling that taro buns in a chinese bakery contain, but I just love to eat it directly like custard. It's already carb and fat loaded. What more could you ask for?\\n\\nWe also tried other dishes which were somewhat forgettable and probably would not order again: \\n- beef noodle soup (lots of noodles, very little beef, beef was chewy, passable)\\n- sesame pancake with no filling (tastes like puff pastry, would NOT order again)\\n- mince pork rice (even though this was cheap ~$3, it contained a mountain-ful of rice and very little mince pork. It was clearly not worth the deal - save your $3 and order something else). In terms of flavor, it was a little too sweet for my liking - typical mince pork rice in Taiwan don't taste this sweet! \\n\\nService was pretty good on a Sunday brunch at 1pm. Our waiters were attentive and cae around to check on us for water and other needs. The place was not packed but there was still a good number of people enjoying the brunch there.

Surely, the menu would be expansive, delicious, and fun. There would be cornbread, and some of those delicious chile rellenos, perhaps some Voodoo Tuna. \\n\\nMaybe I should have paid closer attention to the menu before we went.\\n\\nThe menu of reality looked more like an expanded bar menu or TGI Fridays than the little brother of Z Tejas I had built up in my mind.  There is a big app menu (which is good), loads of things that have been chicken fried, burgers and sisterly sandwiches,  a couple salads here or there, a taco or two and pasta. The limited menu would have been forgiveable had everything been great or delicious. But sadly, not so much.\\n\\nWe started out with the house mojitos (hey, its March). Those were very good- definitely would come back just for drinks. We shared a sad little stand-in for a side salad...a tiny handful of mixed iceburg and romaine with a couple slices of cucumber and baby tomatoes. For $4, I don't expect a salad I could get at Wendy's for $1. I also got the chicken nachitos, only because nothing else looked appetizing to me at that moment (see limitations of menu above). They were nachos. Nothing special. My hubby got the spicy pasta which was the only standout and the only item I would consider ordering again.\\n\\nThe buildings architecture is and has always been marvelous. The interior is very beautiful. The clientele consisted of people who appeared to be from the circle C area and dripping springs; lots of older folks with Perry stickers on the car...lots men with sportcoats and ladies with heavily tinted hair and billowy scarves. \\n\\nI think I am being a little harder on them than I otherwise might have been if my expectations were in order/and or had they not garnered such high stars so far. But...this place and menu felt like someplace in Plano trying to pretend it is Austin, or a chain masquerading as a local restaurant, and we've got enough chains in this neighborhood. Perhaps the menu is what the above clientele wants. Perhaps I am just not their target audience.\\n\\nI might try it again since its one of our few options in 78749, but I have a couple faves I'd visit again before I made it a priority- next time for the HH, and happily give them a star back if everything is good.\\n\\np.s: Our server was ok but I am pretty darn sure he got stoned about halfway through our meal."},{"name":"The Lansdowne Pub","address":"9 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Live Band Karaoke on Thursdays is a hell of a good time if you're a Karaoke fan.

This place is absolutely gorgeous! Everything is wood I feel bad for whoever gets stuck polishing that place but is beautiful nonetheless! Unfortunately due to its location I am afraid it too will become tainted by the drunken shenanigans of Red Sox fans but I hope not.\\n\\nThe food is damn good, I was very impressed. We started with the Mussels and the  Cheese Dip with homemade chips, both were delicious (the cheese dip is made with blue cheese and is very blue cheesy, if your a fan you will love this!). For an entree I had the Gaelic Steak which was fantastic. I had a taste of the Fish & Chips which according to my friend makes or breaks an Irish Pub (he like it so thumbs up for them) I also thought it was good. I also tried the Pork Chops which were pretty good coming from someone who doesn't really like pork chops. For dessert we ordered the Fried Mars Bar, Fried Twinkie, Apple Crisp and the Baileys Cream Pots... yes we are fat kids :) I was not a big fan of the Fried Mars and Twinkie, it kinda creeped me out a little but everyone else at the table was a fan, I'm just weird I guess.

With that in mind, it is expected to be pricier than what you'd get at hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants. I knew this going in, but coming out, it was still my biggest complaint--overpriced. I understand if it's pricier for awesome food, but my husband and I just couldn't say WOW to any of the dishes we ordered. Its kind of sneaky the way tapas works, especially those who love trying new things. You think each plate being priced at $3-6 is sort of a deal, and you want to try many different things in one sitting, but alas, the portions are small, and the bill adds up.\\n\\nI understand it's a new place and they need our feedback, but I honestly, are they really going to lower the prices just because I commented on just that on the comment card they left us with the bill? Well, not likely since it IS a business and they need to survive, but I certainly hope they would consider lowering the price!\\n\\nStaff is friendly, and pretty honest with what dishes have been popular. We tried their suggestions, even though they were still OK and not great:\\n\\nFIVE SPICE TOFU - the yummier dish of the bunch, fried and sweet\\nROTI CANAI - another yummier dish of the bunch, Malaysian curry dipping sauce and \\"pancake\\" tasted pretty authentic\\nYANGCHOU FRIED RICE - better than OK, still on the small side\\nMALAYSIAN NOODLES (I think) - OK \\nBOK CHOY - big mistake...it was fresh and cooked okay, but just so NOT WORTH IT price-wise because I really could have made this at home. Just two pieces of bok choy, one mushroom, in oyster sauce. \\nKOREAN BBQ SLIDERS - another mistake...tasted OK but it's really just a bahn mi sandwich cut into three pieces. The sad part is the price ($6) is about double of those at hole-in-the-wall Asian places, yet, it somewhat looked the most hunger-filling of all the other items here. How paradoxical. And I really don't understand why MAYONNAISE was in there! That could have been omitted. Just put more pickled radishes in there and it'll be just fine!\\n\\nTo top that off, when we were packing up a few leftover items, the waitress took away our plates and one of our plates had food still on there that I was going to pack up! Even if there was a couple of bites left and normally it would have been passable but this is a TAPAS place. You take my plate with a two bites left, that was like 1/3 of the entire plate! I would've said something but she had stacked a plate on top of the food already. SIGH...she really should have been more alert and careful.\\n\\nI don't want to sound like a cheapo, but seriously, something's gotta give--either present tastier food or bigger portions, OR lower the prices. Otherwise, this place won't last very long.

However, the lightly toasted marble rye bread could have been toasted quite a bit more or, better yet, grilled or pressed, and had more mustard slathered on it.  The housemade chips were first rate.

The chicken is tiny which makes you feel the $ squeeze even more. \\n\\nFood: Eh.\\n- Portion size aside, the chicken seemed decent but I would've preferred more salt and less of the spice, whatever it was. \\n- The 2 corn tortillas are about the diameter of tortillas used for small street tacos, but they are thicker, and blander. I LOVE corn tortillas but these were disappointing. \\n- The pinto beans were fine, but I was expecting something different based on the description. \\n- The potatoes seemed okay at first but I liked them less with each bite until I ended up throwing half of them in the trash. They were tender and soft vs. crispy. \\n- I guess the cabbage bed the chicken comes on could be considered a bonus, but it wasn't for me. \\n- The portion size of the sides was definitely small single serving which takes me back to the high prices. If I'm going to spend $11 on a meal, generally speaking, I'd like for there to be enough of it to maybe save some for the next day. All portion sizes at PN are so small that after eating what you'd consider being enough, there's nothing left for later. \\n\\nService:\\nNot bad, not great. I guess I'd call it effective but impersonal. I ordered at the counter, they gave me a number for the table then they brought a small plate and silverware and then the food. No attempt was made for casual conversation during the 3 interactions I had with staff which made it seem somewhat robotic.\\n\\nParking: All street, no lot. \\n\\nCleanliness: Very clean.\\n\\nRestrooms: This place does have them. I only mention this because I thought I read somewhere that it did not."},{"name":"Gang Nam Korean BBQ Restaurant","address":"2065-4580 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"It's really nice Korean bbq, everything is so good!

What could be a real gem of a restaurant is defeated by an environment that sacrifices warmth for trendiness.\\n\\nCertainly Capa has a lot to offer in the way of food. During a marathon evening of wine tasting we tried more than half the menu, and liked most of what we had.\\n\\nThe Hamachi Crudo, served with Clementines and a crunchy Horseradish topping was everyone's favorite, and we had two orders and wanted more.\\n\\nThe Charcuterie Board was the best I've had. It includes Jamon Serrano, Cantimpalo, Lomo and we added some Iberico. The Lomo was particularly good.\\n\\nThe olive asortment included Arbequina, Gordal and Empeltre on the night we were there. Some were pitted, some not, and being served slightly warmed really increased their flavor profile.\\n\\nThe Shrimp coated with Chili were very pungent, a bit overwhelming with ours wines.\\n\\nPatatas Bravas Potatoes looked like tater tots, but were amazingly fluffy, with a delicious Paprika and Black Garlic coating--some of the best potatoes I've ever had, and small enough to not feel guilty.\\n\\nI'm not a big Pork Belly fan, but this version had been seared extra crispy, and I ate all of the generous portion.\\n\\nThe Octopus was chewy and lacked the crisp char needed to make it interesting.\\n\\nVeal Cheeks had a gamey aroma that was quite unappealing.\\n\\nThe roasted Cauliflower was delicious, and served with a sunny side up egg for dipping.\\n\\nFor entrees we tried the 8 ounce Filet and the 12 ounce New York Strip. Both were prime. The filet, having been marinated, had an exotic succulence. The strip boasted a great smokey flavor from the grill and dry aging. Both were pretty pricey, but worth it.\\n\\nThe Bernaise Sauce was unusually thin (and a scanty portion) but proved to be a delicious dipping sauce for the strip, and its thinness actually made it a better accompaniment. It had lots of traditional Bernaise flavor.\\n\\nThe best side dish was the diced Carrot and Celery Root served with Pesto. The Swiss Chard and the Wild Mushrooms were both unremarkable. Yukon Gold mashed potatoes with Brown Butter were good, but not as good as they sound.\\n\\nWe also had an assorted dessert platter with ice creams, cakes, and some really good churros.\\n\\nService was up to the Four Seasons standard, with everyone extremely helpful and friendly.\\n\\nCapa is lucky to have Jill Davis as Sommelier. She is perhaps Central Florida's most knowledgable sommelier, and provided wonderful wine service and interesting comments on the wines we had. The wine list is superb, and excellently priced.\\n\\nIt's worth the hunt for an unlocked door so you can view the Disney fireworks from the terrace outside, which is a welcome escape from the boxy dining room and open kitchen.\\n\\nI wouldn't hesitate to return to Capa for the great food and wine service, but it's not a place I'd pick for a cozy or romantic evening.

I wasn't feeling waffles, but she reassured me they have a great Eggs Benedict, which I admit I would climb mountains and battle Samurais for. I wasn't happy about driving here, but after I got here and saw the cute little sit-down cafe, and moreover that there was no line, my worries were placated. Finally, I would get my morning coffee.\\n\\nAnd get my coffee I did. An iced coffee and I have to say, this was the most perfect and smooth cup of iced coffee I've ever consumed. Not a hint of bitterness. It was divine. I could drink it all day...and never sleep, but I digress. When it came time to order our food, I chose the Eggs Benedict and she got the pecan waffle, which she asked for with strawberries and bananas and real maple syrup.\\n\\nOnce our food came out and I took my first bite into the Crab Benedict, I was beyond ecstatic. I was euphoric. I was in another world of crab and egg goodness. I always hate hearing \\"OMG this was the best thing ever,\\" only to hear a few weeks later of another \\"best thing ever,\\" but I'm going to have to jump on the bandwagon here and pay proper homage to this Crab Benedict for indeed being the best damn Eggs Benedict I've ever had. Her waffle was tasty too, from the few bites I sampled, but damn...that crab was perfect (not salty at all) and the English Muffin was soft, tasty and the eggs perfectly poached.

I had had terrible experiences at their Round Rock location, but I'd figure I'd give this place a benefit of the doubt since it was a different location.\\n\\nSadly, I think the lack of service is just a staple here and as much as I wanted to like CJ (I know, cliche), me and this place (either location) just do not jive.\\n\\nI walked in and \\"signed in\\" at the register (I just don't get that, but whatever) and this lady comes up and says \\"you know there's open seating at the bar?\\" Uh, no, I did not know that, I must have missed the invisible sign...? Not a good start when I'm immediately greeted by incredulity. \\n\\nShe points me to the very end of the very crowded bar and doesn't give me a menu, silverware, nada. I had grabbed a paper menu (live it learn it from the RR location) to peruse. So there I sit at the bar, with everyone buzzing around like bees completely oblivious that I have just been sat and am in need of service. Why this place was so busy on a Wed mid-morning (after 10:30am-ish) or just in general is a mystery to me.\\n\\nI watch waitresses and waiters go to tables that were sat after me and take their order and continue to sit unattended just to see how long it would take before someone even took notice of me (I actually used the stopwatch on my iphone and the magic number before I actually had to ask the lady that sat me \\"Ummm, is ANYONE going to take my order?\\" was 9:48), it was almost 10mins (which in restaurant time is LOOOOOONG) and what finally pushed me over the edge is one of the waitresses actually asked the lady sitting right next to me if she wanted a coffee refresh?!\\n\\nA waitress finally comes and asks me if I know what I want to drink and I tell her my entire order because I dare not risk waiting another 9:48 to track someone down to put in a food order. i got the Ironman omelet and in all fairness the food is fantastic, but since service is so much of the dining experience, the food could have been the best in the world and it would not have made up for the gross and blatant inattention here. \\n\\nI had asked for the Ethiopian coffee they were featuring that day, but was not surprised when I got the house brew. The waitress had also asked me what kind of toast I wanted with my meal and I asked for options and she listed french toast, so I chose that. As an afterthought she says \\"I think there's an upcharge for the french toast, but if there is, it's only like 50 cents or something\\". Again, not surprised when I get to the register to pay and there is a $1.95 upcharge. I don't mind upcharges for add-ons, but I do take issue when they are misquoted as there is a big difference between 50 cents and $2.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I had to flag down a waitress (one of which was standing directly in front of me and when I stared at her to hint that \\"hey, I need something\\" she literally just walked back in the kitchen and stood in the doorway) for a coffee refill. The lady next to me and the subsequent people who sat at the counter had no problem with unsolicited coffee refills and they even got the option of house or Ethiopian. I'm not exactly sure what the issue was with me, if it was where I was seated or I wasn't a regular (it was very evident the disparity of level of service when it involved a regular), but if having to endure this \\"hazing\\" is what it takes to become a regular, I will gladly pass. \\n\\nNever again Cafe Java, I am sorry to say, but the abhorrent service standards you have seems to be a systemic issue rather than a localized one."},{"name":"Taranto's Pizza Barn","address":"601 Hill Rd N","city":"Pickerington","stars":"3","text":"Bought a Groupon and thought we would try this out.

I shared the strawberry-pear salad with my BFF, and the staff very helpfully split the salad into two small bowls without even being asked.\\n\\nThe best part of Apothecary, though, is that it has a large variety of coffee drinks, pots of tea, and wines by the glass, so everyone can find something they want to drink.

For seconds, how about you don't shout this 'suggestion' to me so everyone west of the Mississippi can hear? I was so uncomfortable! I was on my way out anyway because my meter was expiring. But why did i feel like I was obligated to explain that?  Clearly, in his eyes, I had committed some sort of cardinal sin and the coffee gods would send my soul to purgatory until I had been forgiven of my caffeinated disgrace. That little androgynous troll of a man. I want to pluck him in the eye.\\n\\nIn short, worst cafe experience in recent memory.

We notified the server and she had the extra charges removed. However, she said that the Burrito Al Pastor is a special that comes with Chicken, so that is why we were charged.

She informed me that they didn't have bottled water and then made a regular sized cup of water. She then gave me my total again this time with two dollars added to it. I ask her why the total change and she informed me that they charge extra for bigger cups, which I think is crazy since bottled water isn't available. I paid and she handed me my food and turned away to work on the next ordered. Didn't ask me if I needed sauce or anything.

We made reservations for two knowing that it would be busy so we got in pretty fast, otherwise I'm not sure how long the wait would've been.\\n\\nSo on our visit this time we decided to order a variety of items to test the selection:\\n- tataki sashimi\\n- shrimp gyoza\\n- aburi sushi \\n- adegashi tofu \\n- a pitcher of sangria \\n\\nThe total came out to be $38 bucks, which to be honest after this meal wasn't neither tasty or filling. The sushi was surprising considering this is vancouver and I found it to be very subpar. The tofu and gyoza were okay but portions were really small for the inflated prices.\\n\\nThe redeeming point would have been the fact that there is a Yelp discount for 10%. I claimed the offer with the staff that night and they said it was no problem. I found out later that it was not applicable on the weekend night that I went so they never applied the discount. This is fine except for the fact that nobody on staff bothered to tell us, even when they initially confirmed at the beginning of the meal as well we would get 10% off. This is also misleading from the Yelp side as well as it says check-in to get 10% without detailing the conditions until after you check-in and get there. Either way it would've been nice for someone to tell us this, and I think the staff could've been more receptive to this.\\n\\nOverall, this place is where all the Asian babydolls come to predrink so I can only imagine how rowdy this place would be if I came later. The nice decor can't make up for bad patrons unfortunately. So with subpar food, price and ambiance, why did I give this place two stars? Well, besides the discount gaff, the service was decent and the waitresses did for the most part come so I give them their due credit. I could potentially see Ebisu being a restaurant that's a nice night out on the town, but not until they figure out how to better serve customers. We ended up going for more drinks down the street afterwards."},{"name":"Fresa's - South 1st","address":"1703 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great spot off busy south congress street.

I'd walked by Rustic Kitchen a few times, so when it appeared on the group-buying site, I eagerly purchased the offer and promptly forgot about it. On the last day I could redeem the coupon, Jeremy K and I made our way to the restaurant. We were seated promptly, and the experience declined from here.\\n\\nAfter staring at the menu for at least ten minutes, I settled on the lobster risotto. Generally an indecisive person, the menu's lack of focus only exacerbated my struggle to choose a dish that would reflect positively on the restaurant as a whole. I was also rather wary of choosing a mediocre entree as the bread we received when seated was exactly that: mediocre.\\n\\nService was prompt and our waitress attentive, but it was clear that the chef was either inexperienced or indifferent to the expectations that the menu's complexity and price impart. The lobster was considerably overcooked and its accompanying risotto lacked any depth of flavor. It was clear that pureed corn accompanied the rice, but it lent little to the dish, and the same is true of the bacon, which was obviously added late in the risotto's preparation. For $24, I expected much more of this notably-bland dish.\\n\\nAs evidenced by Jeremy K's review, the chef's apathy extended to the bartender, who complained to another patron about the drink Jeremy ordered. There was nothing particularly complex about the cocktail, but it was nonetheless more involved than the bartender had patience for. \\n\\nOverall, save our waitress, the entire establishment seemed lackluster and I certainly have no plans to return any time soon."},{"name":"Capa Steakhouse & Bar","address":"10100 Dream Tree Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We visited for our 1-year anniversary and we had an outstanding experience.

We ALWAYS get the smalls in their larger cups when we take it to go and we've never had a problem with this. I asked for the small to be put in the larger cup with a lid to go. The person behind the counter gave me an attitude about it and tried to explain to me that that cup was for the 4 scoop and not the 2 scoop. I told him I know, but we've always had it like that so I can transport with without the lids coming off on the drive home. He gave me more attitude while scooping the first one and then threw it up on the counter. When I asked for a lid to take it to go he rolled his eyes and huffed while getting the lid. The other young guy that's normally there just looked at me and then back at him while doing this. After scooping my second he asked 0who does this for me because there's only only four (while using his hands and holding up four fingers) other people that work here. Me, my father, a girl, & him (while pointing at the younger guy).\\" I told him that everyone including his father and the taller blonde woman all do it.

Mind you I've been going here for over a year and I've had great conversations with everyone else that works here and this was my first time meeting him. He furthermore argues with me about it being a business and that everything has a cost.

The decor in Osaka is really modern, streamlined and beautiful.  I loved the vibe.\\n\\nThe menu was very extensive, lots of great options, particularly for those of us with shellfish allergies.\\n\\nThe reason I gave them three stars instead of more?  Our waitress.\\nI'm not sure what her deal was.  We ate early on a Wednesday night, and the restaurant was relatively empty at the time, so it couldn't have been that she was particularly stressed at the time.\\n  Ten seconds after I sat down and ordered a drink, she took the table's wine/liquor menus away.  Despite the fact we were still waiting for one more person to arrive, and she hadn't asked us if we wanted to order anything from it.\\n\\nShe came over FOUR TIMES to ask if we were ready to order, in the span of 10 minutes.  The third member of our party had only just sat down when the waitress asked the second time.  And despite the fact we had our menus wide-open, and were staring at them when she asked the fourth time, she still couldn't figure out that we were still looking.  I just gave up at that point and ordered.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the avocado salad, which arrived with fish roe mixed in, though that wasn't described on the menu.  She's not a fish fan and so asked for another salad, sans-fish products, to which the waitress replied \\"it's not fish.\\"  My friend insisted on another salad, & the waitress told her re: \\"I think it's fake.\\"  WTF?  Eventually she relented and got my friend another salad.\\n\\nI had the New Osaka Maki (tuna, avocado, etc) and the Mexican Roll (spicy salmon, avocado).  The Mexican Roll was tasty, if a little sloppily-prepared, and I didn't get the New Osaka Roll till some time later (they should have been served simultaneously, as my entree).  The New Osaka came with a mysterious-looking sauce, that appeared to have bits of crab in it.  I was concerned and inquired if it did from the waitress.  She gave me a blank stare.  My companion volunteered that I have a shellfish allergy, and the waitress rudely said, \\"well, you should have told me that beforehand.\\"  I understand that it could be relevant, but I also know how to read a menu, and would never order a dish with shellfish in it.  In the end, she didn't know the answer to my question, and went to ask the chef (it didn't have any shellfish in it).  \\nI found the sauce overly-sweet and kind of bizarre, but loved the softness of the tempura-ed tuna.\\n\\nMy friend's bento box came with a full 6-piece California roll, which was a pleasant surprise, huge shrimp and a generous portion of chicken, and she took her leftovers home so she seemed to enjoy it.  Osaka had the standard fried banana/mochi/ice cream dessert menu so we did not partake.  We discovered a lovely bar/lounge downstairs which, though completely empty at 8 PM on a Wednesday, seems like it could be fun when it gets going.   I definitely want to return to try Hibachi, which sounded like a blast from the shouts emanating from the other room.

However, the website tries to sell it as a dance party with a great dinner, which it was not, at least on a Sunday night.  \\n\\nThe dinner was good, but it wasn't the reason to go on the cruise, but it also won't make you sick.  There was a dance floor and a dj, but people cared more about going on the decks for the views after dinner.

I've eaten at Matsuhisa , Sasabune, Zushi Puzzle, Tama, Todai (oops), etc, etc. Traveling on business leads the this type of exorbitant lifestyle. Oga's is by far my favorite.\\n\\nSitting at the bar is a must. Every chef produces exquisite dishes. Oga himself is awesome, supremely talented and charismatic. He only works mondays and tuesday so be aware of that before you head in for omakase. The omakase is very reasonable, you can have an amazing experience for around $70 before tips/drinks. Definitely a better deal than Nobu's somewhat impersonal omakase's.\\n\\nThe dishes are extremely varied, there are tons of choices... one week i ate there for 7 days straight which is probably the record. Let's just say they know me by now. The prices are very reasonable. My favorites are:\\n\\n- hamachi usuzukuri (yellow tail with ponzu and a dab of hotsauce)\\n- salmon avocado salad (fairly unique)\\n- seared toro (to die for)\\n- omakase \\n\\nMonthly specials - they have new specials each month and each chef is required to come up with a new recipe. Sometimes it's variants on tuna tartar, but other times you get something marvelous like \\"oysters with mozzarella over carmelized onions\\" or a wine glass filled with tofu, uni, ikura, tuna chunks. \\n\\nDefinitely go for at least one of the monthly specials. \\n\\nDid I mention they have Kobe beef and shabu shabu as well?\\n\\nOmakase:\\n\\nThey don't hold reservations for the bar.... typically. So call ahead and demand the seats in front of Oga. It's best to arrive early when it's not as busy. This ensures that you have Oga's undivided attention for 2 1/2 hours.\\n\\nMy friends and I hit this place up last month for omakase. Twice. In one week. \\n\\nDid this faze Oga? Not one bit. His creative juices rose to the challenge, rarely repeating a dish that we had previously had. Typically it starts with a cooked dish, followed by sashimi omakase. Then another cooked dish which was fried octopus so succulent that my friend mistook it for calamari. Followed by exquisite nigiri so delicately crafted that we HAD to take photos (check out my profile pics). I loved the uni nigiri, just because 99% of the time you get that gunkan style. Oga was putting uni in just about everything for that extra burst of flavor. At the end you MUST get the black sesame sorbet. It's that good.\\n\\nOga rocks. By far the best omakase experience I've ever had. He doesn't engage you that often, but he's quirky and makes you laugh. The best part is that he had one of his apprentices pouring beer for him while he was creating his masterpieces. He would down each beer in two sips with a satisfied \\"aaaaahhhhh.\\" For some reason this pleased us to no end. The 2nd best part was when my friend was trying to take a picture of him torching the toro. He actually posed with the flame facing up for a few seconds! Unfortunately we didn't get a photo of that :(\\n\\nOh yeah we dropped $140.... each.

What I mean by meat heavy is the ratio of meat to other ingredients was out of whack.

We used to opt for this place over Fugakyu because there was never a wait and the food was just as fresh and good.  I would even say there are a few dishes that are better here - like the gyoza.  But lately, it's obvious that Ginza is not getting the same traffic, and their response appears to be that they are trying to cut costs - or I will say that the quality of the food has gone down significantly.  Last night we were served an incredibly bad cut of hamachi sushi, and frankly the tunaconda maki and tuna sushi lacked the usual composition of ingredients and rice consistency that separates great sushi from okay.  It was okay at best.  Sad to say that now Fugakyu has increased space and the wait is no longer an issue, that is probably where business is going.  Ginza is either going to spiral to the bottom by cutting cost and quality or they will have to really step it up and invest to get it back.

It's not like they're really cheffing it up big with the unseasoned meats and frozen meatballs; but then again, how can you with hot pot? However, I will say that for $18.95, you get a ton of unlimited options in meats, veggies, and other dishes. You can choose from sliced beef, sliced lamb, beef tripe, beef heart, fish balls, meat balls, baby bok choy, spinach, mushrooms, bean sprouts, water cress, etc. That isn't even half the list. They also serve items outside of the pot like pork buns, scallion pancakes, etc. (all included in the price). I did find it hilarious that at the top of the menu they note that you can only dine for 2 hours. I've never seen that written at any \\"all you can eat\\" or buffet, but this spot plays no games. I will say that the buns, dumplings, and wontons that they serve, are super mediocre. They definitely did those on some frozen from the supermarket tip. The filling is almost a joke. However, they're spicy broth has great flavors and you can see everything that they used to marinate the soup base(garlic cloves, etc). I'm so glad this was the case, because it's really the hot pot broth that makes or break your taste bud's experience. But, when you order, I would recommend the 50/50 split of the nutrition broth(basic broth) and the spicy broth. The spicy broth alone is very oily, so the 50/50 provides a good balance. Also, they will refill your broth at no extra cost, if you ask.\\n\\nThe one thing that I didn't appreciate was that the server didn't help us on how to order. She just dropped the menus and left. The menu shares a similar style to the way you order sushi. You get a list of all the options, and you circle what you want. What kind of broth do you want? which sauces? types of meats? veggies? side dishes? There was so much to choose from, I was like  \\"Can I choose just anything? Can I circle as much as I want?\\". I had to flag her down to confirm that I was doing this right. Pretty much, you circle everything and anything that you want to start off with, and they'll bring the items out within 5+ minutes. When you're ready to order more, just ask them for your order sheet again, and they will bring it with a different color pen to differentiate what you desire next. Repeat process.\\n\\nOverall, the price is great for the abundance of food. Was I impressed with the actual food itself? I will say \\"yes\\" because of the spicy broth.

Unfortunately, due to the somewhat cold temperatures, the patio was closed.  But, about halfway through the first course, the manager came and offered us to not just move to the patio, but to move us to one of the few tables right by the river.  We decided to just eat dessert down there, but it was absolutely perfect.  I couldn't believe someone would take the time to offer us such an incredible experience.

It does truly taste authentic, as if you had been tasting copies of this sandwich until now.  But it's occasionally too much - the garlicky aftertaste is nice for the first hour, not as nice in hour five (or the next morning, on one occasion).  Always get, if they are available, the greek potatoes.  The fries, well, they're just fries.\\n\\nI owe it to myself to try other things on the menu, when and if they are offered.

Absolutely perfect\\n             Tempura Cauliflower:  10. Outstanding \\n              Street corn: 5 Needs changed  \\n\\n            \\nCons: service was not great, server seemed uninterested in giving the \\"Passport\\" experience. \\nFood runner did not know what was on the charcuterie board which used to be a fun highlight of passport.  \\n\\nOverall, absolutely will be back.  It was great and I think has the potential to excel past the old passport. Menu maybe needs slight expansion and servers just need a bit more time and experience.  Excited it's back!!!

The freshness of the ingredients, the characteristic flavor of the thin & fluffy hand-stretched dough and smokiness imparted by the wood-fired oven, an authentic Italian pizza is a culinary delight. Encompassing all of these qualities and components, Varuni Napoli serves truly impeccable  mouthwatering pizzas. \\n\\nMenu & Food:\\nMenu comprises classic & artisan white and red pizzas (around 5 of each type), calzone, salads and desserts (cannoli & nutella calzone).\\nI tried the 'Porecca Piccante' ($15) which comprised of fresh buffalo mozzarella, hot soppressata (spicy salami), san marzano & cherry tomatoes, calabrian peppers, pecorino romano cheese & basil. What can I say, it was a symphony of flavors/ingredients in my mouth. The rustic pizza base with that delicate balance of  crunchy and fluffiness, blend of fresh cheese and incredibly delicious pizza sauce and the salami & other ingredients uplifting the flavor profile, each bite was a celebration in itself. It almost melts in your mouth. I also particularly liked that the pizza didn't feel heavy or too greasy. \\n\\nAmbiance:\\nLocated at Krog street the place is bustling with energy. There are stools & tables around the pizzeria counter  with an open kitchen right in-front. Additionally, there are sufficient stand tables and benches within the market.\\n\\nService: \\nIt is basically a self service. The staff (taking order) are courteous and polite and helpful to give suggestions/guide you in menu selection and answer questions regarding ingredients etc. It's enjoyable to watch your pizza being prepared in the open kitchen. The process is pretty fast and your order is ready within minutes\\n\\nParking:\\nParking gets pretty busy here and although there are private parking lots and limited street parking available, getting a parking spot on weekends is a nuisance. What I have heard, it's better to park around belt-line/ponce city instead and walk a few distance.\\n\\nTo sum up:\\nIt has been a few weeks that I tried pizza here and I still can't stop thinking about it's deliciousness. It goes without saying, I am a huge fan and will surely be back to try other pizzas and items from their menu. Varuni Napoli, undoubtedly is one of the best pizzerias in Atlanta and a must try."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great food!

Once the buzzer went off, we found that they planned to seat us at a 4 person table on the porch with an extra seat on the end, so we wound up waiting a little bit longer for a bigger table inside away from the heat.

The flavor was wonderful and they added some spice for me, though next time I think I'll stress a little more that I want it VERY hot (I ordered it extra spicy hot, and it was spicy, but not as hot as I'd like). It's the closest I've had to my favorite Pad Ga Prau, which is nice because no other place I've tried even comes close. I also had the Tom Kha soup but I can't really say I enjoyed it much. It wasn't bad I guess, but was overly sweet and even though it's my favorite soup I wouldn't order it here again. The friend dining with me tried it too and didn't care for it.\\n\\nMy co-diner ordered something with prawns and I was very impressed with the size of the prawns, plus they were cooked very well.

First, the downside - the burritos are $7, which is definitely higher than just about every place in town.  BUT, they're delicious.  I had pork, and it was unlike any other burrito I've had in Boston/Cambridge.  The pork was cooked to order in some sort of spicy red adobo sauce.  All the burritos seem to come with a bit of sliced vegetables, too, in addition to rice and beans - zucchini, squash, onion, broccoli.  This seemed odd at first, but it's really good.  They have a bunch of stuff you can add, too - salsa, hot sauces, lettuce, diced onion, guacamole, cilantro, shredded cheese - and it seems that there's no extra charge for guac or anything else.  The burritos come with a small side of chips and red salsa (not pico de gallo).  Really the only downside was the cost.  And the long-ish wait (for a taqueria) - about 10 minutes - but it was cooked to order, tasted fresher than any burrito I've had in a long time, and they just opened today.

I am, however, going to leave my previous review in tact and online because that was one experience and this another.\\n\\nA note: I am a liberal pescatarian. My husband eats everything. So it is important to note that, while Hawkers' menu well-outlines a shared plate experience, the below review does not necessarily reflect this worthy mission. \\n\\nThe Fish Filet with Black Bean Sauce was not a filet. It was fish pieces ('sticks' would be applicable), non-descript medium-textured white fish pieces. However, they were perfectly breaded and, clearly, presented to act as a simple vessel for the black bean sauce... which was uh-maz-zing. Pieces of black bean were floating amidst a liquid that was both sweet and savory, dense with bits of peanut that had, somehow, retained a bit of crunch. There were also tiny bits of garlic that reinforced and embodied the previously mentioned \\"sweet and savory.\\" I could drink this sauce. I only wish that it had been a bit stickier. I had to drag the fish pieces through it several times to soak up as much of the goodness as possible. But, again, goodness. \\n\\nMy husband busily gnawed his jerk spice wings. This is a new development for him. Wings that is. I think too many bad bony bird parts spoiled wings for him in his youth and he has avoided them for years. He generally blames the likes of horror-houses (take that to mean whatever one wishes) like Hooters and its cheap chain brethren but, I digress. My husband has recently discovered the carnivorous joy of wings and, here, he nodded and grinned a bit between bites. (He didn't speak. He believes that verbal communication wastes good eating time once a plate has reached the table.) Clearly, this was a success for him as he was quite thorough so as not to leave a bit of bird behind.\\n\\nThe roti with curry sauce was not an innovative experience and certainly lives in that non-descript place that seems typical of modern Asian cuisine. I have had similar elsewhere and thought the same. However, this is not a complaint. This is an example of when the expected works. In fact, I appreciated the fact that someone in the kitchen took just a little care with a very simple thing so that what we received transcended \\"bread and sauce\\" and thus, a $3.00 starting plate was not only satisfying but finger-licking. It was a moment when one remembers that standards are such for a reason. A good reason.\\n\\nWith dessert : the Three Tea Cr√®me Brulees --- I will wage complaint. The tiny squared bowls (almost condiment-sized) were overflowing with whipped cream. However, the brulees below the monolithic clouds were lovely. My favorite was the Thai Tea (not a surprise, I have conducted a long affair with Thai Tea) but the Milk Tea and the Green Tea were also delightful. A nice intersection between indulgent and delicate. But, my god, the whipped cream! I felt like I needed a ladle to get it out of the way. That said, my husband slurped it up. All of it; his share as well as the white fluff I had discarded. Had someone offered him a straw for it, he probably would have uttered a quick, \\"Thank you,\\" and proceeded to inhale as fervently as those who craved a different questionable white substance in the 1980s. So, admittedly, this whipped cream issue is a personal taste thing. \\n\\nAnd, now, the best for last. Our noodle dishes. \\n\\nMy husband got the Beef Haw Fun [I think?] and went to work on it in his usual fashion. He later reported that it was rich and hearty. The thick noodles were perfect in texture: slick and saucy on the outside, a bit of bite on the inside. The dark sauce was gravy-esque and brought all the good things that go with such. \\n\\nMy Mee Goreng Noodles were a multi-leveled and almost dreamy experience that deeply satisfied the twenty-something still inside me who, in my NYC days, craved 1:00AM Chinese or Thai take-out several times a week. This bowl of beauty also sated the NOT-twenty-something that I have become who enjoys dinner before midnight and takes great pleasure in chewing slowly enough to taste every nuance and complexity. I asked for medium heat (the menu does not specify this as a spicy dish) and received just that. Along with this deft understanding of heat as seasoning not warfare came wonderful waves of saltiness and a touch of sweetness, the slightest bit of acidity (I did squeeze on some of the fresh lime that arrived in my bowl) and bites of still just-barely crunchy vegees with tangles of well-finessed noodles. This was both comfort and sophistication. I do not live near enough to Hawkers to make this my weekly take-out but, if I did... Oh, if only I did!\\n\\nService was excellent. Well-timed and appropriate.

I guess that's what you would call it. It's not a patio because the space was so large. Everyone ordered and got their snausages, all of which were delivered and displayed on these prideful racks except for mine. My snausage came on an oversized platter laid over a bed of grits without a bun. What a freakin' let down. Holy smokes it was so insanely weak that everyone was laughing hysterically at the presentation. Although I was disappointed, I couldn't help but laugh my ass off. It was so wack, check out my photo. Haha!\\n\\nOn to the flavors - BBQ Bacon and Shrimp sausage with white cheddar grits.\\n\\nThe snausage was incredibly good. It was so extremely good, I can't get over it. It had that salty smokey bacon flavor with strong notes of shrimp in the background, but not fishy. It was definitely one of the most interesting sausages I've ever had. This flavor was then offset by the creamy cheese grits. I was super impressed with theses grits. I hate grits! What the hell is wrong with me??? Well what the hell, it was damn good and paired nicely with the bacon shrimp sausage. \\n\\nWell done!!!!\\n\\n\\nI'll definitely come back to kick it and try the other brats and sausages.

There are signs directing you were to go, but they still don't show you directly to the place. I had to drive around a few times to actually find City Winery. Then when I found it I had to keep driving around for parking. This place was bustling with people shopping and just enjoying their Sunday evening. I finally found the entrance to the City Winery. You had to walk a ways to get to the actual business. Walking inside was like walking into a posh restaurant in a very elegant city. There was a hostess greeting you and guiding you to the restaurant or the actual concert venue, which is downstairs. You can rent this place and hold anything kind of gathering you like. Once downstairs, you had employees directing to you seats and introducing you to the wait staff that will be tending to you. There's water on the table for you to drink once you sit down. This place had an extensive menu of creative cuisine. Like some other places, you don't have to order anything from the menu if you come here for a show. I love this place because it's a very intimate venue and every seat in the house is a perfect seat. This place has an event almost every day of the week, so it's always something or someone you want to see!!! Cherrelle came out and gave such a great performance. She was very personable and sung many of her hits that made me fall in love her in the first place. She even brought one of the daughters on stage with her and told the story of how she was born. Cherrelle was on a concert cruise having fun with other artists and her stomach started hurting really bad. The pain was unbearable so she went to the doctor on staff and he told her she was about to have a baby. To begin with she didn't even know she was pregnant. She eventually had a healthy baby girl!!! She sung 'Everything I Miss at Home' to her daughter, which is one of my favorite songs ever!!! I didn't want this concert to end because it was very enjoyable!!!

Definitely not on the high end \\n* Decor - better than SuperSub\\n* Portions - Not excessive but didn't feel like they were meager either.  Plate presentations were unremarkable but I wasn't expecting a culinary masterpiece either.  \\n\\nLet's move on to the negatives: \\n* Food - The food was quite bland. The fried calamari came with the weakest tomato sauce that seemed to come straight from a can. The fries had no flavor. My wife had the baked scallops, which were passable. The onion rings, while thin, were not overly crunchy or flavorful. It just seemed like somebody forgot to add seasoning of any kind.  \\n* Environment - People keep describing it as  a \\"clam shack;\\"  it's not a clam shack.  Clam shacks are a kitschy, fun high energy environment.  This was decidely low energy and virtually no ambiance of any kind; it was almost cafeteria-like sterile.  \\n* Beer & Wine - They've got to take it up a notch.  They had 3-4 bottled beers and a couple of beers on tap.  Nothing unique or remarkable except if you like Narragansett in a can.  \\n\\nNeutral:\\nService - It's a different type of service.  they take your order at the counter/bar and then deliver your food by having a runner wander aimlessly out of the kitchen, call out your number and then drop the plates on you.  It could be improved if they simply asked where you were sitting when taking the order and then delivering the food to your table with some type of precision.  Regardless, the service shouldn't hurt the experience (although it won't really help the experience either). \\n\\nConclusion: With so many options in Marblehead and the surrounding area, we'd be hard pressed to return any time soon."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"330 Middlesex Ave.","city":"Medford","stars":"1.5","text":"DO NOT go to this Wendy's location! This location is horrible - every order is made incorrectly and/or missing items and the staff is completely awful and RACIST. My wife and I were absolutely horrified by a recent drive-thru experience. We were forced to go through the horrible drive-thru because the store was closed inside. Upon reaching the drive-thru, the worker taking the order was immediately rude. After explaining what I wanted he repeated the first item back incorrectly. I asked multiple times to start over because he could not get the first item correct and kept repeating the wrong info to us. He kept interrupting me and would not let me explain what I wanted. This is the horrifying part - at a certain point he doesn't realize his headset is still going over the speaker and makes an inappropriate comment to either himself or a co-worker. He states clearly \\"What the (f word) do you want (racist word that I will not repeat)?\\" I'm not sure if he was talking to us under his breath or to himself or a co-worker, but it was insane. We drove off at that point out of the drive-thru and left. I then emailed Wendy's customer support through the Wendy's website twice and received no help. When I submitted a complaint I included the exact date of the incident, the store address and store number and the time of the incident. All they emailed me back was that they could not locate this store. I emailed them back on July 15 to repeat the store information that I gave. Nobody has contacted me back since. You would think that Wendy's would care about one of their stores having such horrific staff, but apparently they do not care enough to even email somebody back. Wow!

When we were ready, someone came to take our order, and even though we both ordered huge omelets, I couldn't help but ask about the grilled muffin.

I ordered the California omelet. It was three eggs stuffed with artichoke hearts, provolone and tomatoes. Topped with more provolone and served alongside home fries.\\n\\nThe home fries were delicious, and the omelet was very good. It needed more salt, and maybe some garlic or something. The omelet was also very wet. I know it was stuffed with tomatoes, and artichoke hearts, so that is to be expected, but it took away from it a little bit. My main complaint with my breakfast though, was the cheese on top. It was just slices of provolone. Nothing wrong with that, but it made it harder to get cheese in every bite. Every time you cut into it, all of the cheese tried to come with it. \\n\\nThis was a fantastic breakfast at a cool, local restaurant. I loved the collection of salt & pepper shakers all over the place. Each table has a different set, and they are literally everywhere. It reminded me of my grandmother.

We tend to drive all the way to Stoneham to a place called Tulip for Hibachi but thought to give this place a try since it's on our door step.  The interior has been tastefully done and there is nice dividing for more separation, but 90% of the restaurant is the Korean BBQ, 5% is 2 hibachi tables and the rest is the sushi bar.   We decided to try the Korean BBQ since they only has one hibachi chef and the kids were hungry.\\n\\nSo heres the issue:  the pricing is way too high when you want to do the BBQ.  Its $40 per adult and $15 per kid and it's a set price so there is no alternative.  Yes you can order off the menu but why can't you order off the menu one item and cook it yourself?  Thats the point of Korean BBQ.  Order it and cook it.  Not be forced to order $40 worth of food and feel like you have to stuff yourself to get what you paid for.  \\n\\nOur bill was already at $110 on a Tuesday night without anything to drink.  By the time we walked out it was $150 and unfortunately we won't be going back unless it's to do the hibachi.\\n\\nIts also a bit surprising this opened when we already have Dabin, Dikenyama and 2 Chinese.\\n\\nAdvice for the owner:  Fix the pricing."},{"name":"Red Fez","address":"209 W 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"One question:  WHY am I only JUST NOW discovering the goodness known as teh Fez???

The person I went with had been there before and told me that the food was good but pricier than similar options nearby.  For example, the sandwiches are a little pricier than similar sandwiches elsewhere.\\n\\nWhen we walked in, we were seated immediately and handed the menus.  I don't believe they had any lunch specials - just the regular menu.  I have to agree I was surprised at the prices for some of the specialty sandwiches, many of which were over $10!  However, I was relieved to see that the back of the menu had deli sandwich options that were cheaper.\\n\\nI decided to order the Chicken Salad Sandwich and noticed that they had two chicken salad options for the sandwich - Joy's traditional Southern Chicken Salad or Apple Walnut Chicken Salad.  After asking the server to describe what's in the southern chicken salad and hearing the word \\"mustard\\" (not a fan of it in sandwiches), I quickly chose the Apple Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich.  The server also told me the bread options I could choose from, and I chose ciabatta.  All sandwiches come with a piece of fruit and a side of your choice.  \\n\\nThe options for sides include pasta salad, potato salad, tomato cucumber and onion salad, mixed green salad, and dirty chips.  I chose the pasta salad, which turned out to be an excellent decision!\\n\\nOur food didn't take very long to be served, which was a pleasant surprise!\\n\\n* Apple Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich ($7.99) - I was very pleased with the size of the sandwich!  It was pretty large and, thankfully, cut in half.  I really enjoyed the soft, fresh ciabatta bread, loved the big chunks of chicken, and savored the pieces of apples and walnuts!  However, I was only able to eat half of it because it filled me up!  But I was happy that I could enjoy leftovers later.  =)\\n\\n* Pasta Salad (Side item I chose for my sandwich) - Per the menu description, this is a \\"Mediterranean pasta salad with sun dried tomatoes, olives, carrots, peppers, feta cheese with a red wine vinaigrette.\\"  The pasta in the salad was bowtie pasta, and although it was softer than I normally like (I would have preferred it to be al dente), the combination of the various ingredients made it so delicious!  I'm not really a fan of feta cheese, but it was perfect in the pasta salad and I would definitely order this side again!\\n\\nOverall, Joy Cafe and Bakery gets 4 stars for their fresh, delicious sandwiches and friendly service!  Although our server initially brought just one check for us, we asked if we could get separate checks.  Instead of bringing us new checks, however, she wrote our totals separately on the same check, which was fine.  I appreciated that she accommodated our request.  I'm sure I will return to Joy Cafe, and I will probably order the Apple Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich and pasta salad again because I enjoyed it that much!

Waitress had mentioned the pasta is made fresh daily, that is for sure noticeable. The bread and the white bean dip was also wonderful, might I add.\\n\\nAll over great dining experience.

Apparently, PDX has a way of doing that with mediocre ethnic food mixed with high prices not found in other cities (like LA, SF, SD, SEA, VAN).  Getting back to this place, yes it was very overpriced, especially for the quality.  The service was okay, someone mentioned that there's an abundance of staff, which is true - we had like 5 or 6 waiters in all.

My husband and I both started with drinks. I had a Hibiscus Margarita that was to die for and my husband had an asian pear gin & tonic. We were sold right then. We loved being able to chit chat over candle light and drinks in a space that was industrial but home-y. We ordered our food after lots of help from our waitress - lamb sliders (included in happy hour), potato chips (included in happy hour), and ham and manchengo croquettes. They were sooo incredibly delicious, but the portions were small, and I don't mean that in a bad way. They were perfect sized for the light dinner we were looking for. After splitting those three, we were still a little hungry so we decided to order some deviled eggs. They came with sardines which I really liked and were incredibly tasty. After this, I just wanted to drink some water, ponder my next cocktail, and decide on dessert, but when I told the waitress this she got a little pushy, which was weird since the restaurant was far from packed at 6 pm. But she gave us our space and when she came back I ordered a glass of the house Rose and my husband ordered a fig manhattan. My rose was good, but not phenomenal. Better than I'd expect for the happy hour prices. My husband's Manhattan was full price, but all too worth it. We received churros with honey and chocolate dipping sauce that were still hot when they came out (yumm!). It might have been one of the best things I have ever, ever tasted. The churros had a crunchy outside but a super soft, gooey inside and a perfect amount of cinnamon sugar and apple spice.

I asked the waitress why is the fish burnt and she quickly replied, \\"It is always like that.\\"  Indeed, the edges of Gindara is usually caramelized with the miso marinade but not the whole side of the fish!

But in the last 2 years they've stepped up their game on desserts as well as the portion size on some dishes. They've also changed their food with the seasons, bringing in lots of new and creative dishes  which we have enjoyed.\\n\\nAnd lastly, they hold a variety of special events such as cider tastings and holiday celebrations and these have been a LOT of fun with special food and drink. \\n\\nAll these changes show in their popularity, so make a reservation if possible, or show up early or late to avoid the weekend crowds. \\n\\nIn short, I'me happy to report that Harper Station is alive and well and doing a genuine 5-star job!\\n\\n\\n**********************************************\\nPREVIOUS REVIEWS\\n**********************************************\\nThis is an update of my review from November, 2010. \\nIn that review I gave Harper Station 3 stars. I dinged them heavily on portion size and cost.\\n\\nIn this visit there were two main differences from our first visit:\\n\\n1. We went earlier so it was not crowded.\\n2. The food menu has changed with the seasons.\\n\\nBoth of these led to a much better experience.\\n\\nAbout The Atmosphere\\nI should first admit that I am not a big fan of the trend toward what I call open galley seating. This where the restaurant and bard are jammed into a single long room with a view of the kitchen and the walls are brick or steel with an exposed ceiling. When places like this get crowded the noise level rises so that everyone is eventually shouting. \\n\\nThis is not fun or vibrant or interesting. It's just fucking annoying.\\nWhen it's crowded, H Harper can be like this, and when I'm in that situation I quickly shut down and withdraw because it's too exhausting to converse over the din.\\n\\nOn this visit we were one of 3 tables. This meant that the whole experience was transformed into a more intimate and quiet affair in which my husband and I could converse, get opinions from the server, and even exchange niceties without having to scream. The entire meal was so much more enjoyable that I am forced to conclude that my previous review was likely colored by this.\\n\\nWe started with cocktails - including a Ham on Rye with bacon-flavored rye whiskey - and loved them both.\\n\\nA charcuterie plate and a pickle plate gave us some nibbly bits while we read the new menu.The sausage and the liver spread were fantastic.\\n\\nFor dinner we ordered the chicken fried chicken and a steak - we wanted to share them. The steak was perfectly cooked and reasonably sized for the price. The sides of mushrooms and potato salad were excellent.\\n\\nThe breaded chicken filet was the real star. It was thick and juicy and tender and perfectly cooked. As much as I love steak, I'd choose the chicken if I had to choose.\\n\\nAll in all the food - including portion sizes - were fantastic and this time I didn't feel as though I'd been over-charged - until I got to dessert. \\n\\nWhen is Pie not Pie?\\nWhen you screw up the crust.\\nFirst let me say I applaud H Harper for making their own desserts instead of opting for the usual Atlanta dessert clones you see everywhere. \\n\\nThat said, if you offer me Blueberry Pie with homemade ice cream, don't serve a deconstructed pie. And if you offer me a deconstructed pie, you had best make damned sure you know how to do the 2 primary components of pie right. \\n\\nPie is crust and filling, and I believe that they are equally important. You cannot have great pie without both a great filling and a great crust. Similarly, you cannot hope to have a successful deconstructed pie without approximating the divine combination of a sumptuous filling wrapped in a flaky delicate and buttery crust. At least half of the enjoyment of pie comes from a well-executed crust. \\n\\nThe blueberry \\"pie\\" I was served was actually a compote poured over some kind of stale bread-like discs that approximated the flavor and mouth feel of communion wafers. The blueberry compote was a little too tart, but not bad. The peach ice cream was excellent. But those wafers killed the whole thing.\\n\\nAs for my husband, he had a chocolate torte which, if I'm being honest, was far too thick. No desert should require a steak knife to cut. The flavor was good, but the torte felt more like a hard fudge.\\n\\nSo I take 1 start off for the dessert.

It's not the best place to watch a football game, but when you get a mini crowd rooting for a Navy win over Notre Dame, MAN! you feel like you're at a sports bar.  The bartenders are really great.  Really nice and are on the ball.  Since this place is a brewery, try out the Northern Light or the Duckabish Amber.    Check out their happy hour specials and you can buy kegs too.  They're pretty great!  Their outside deck is nice and bands are usually scheduled.\\n\\nWe also had dinner in their small banquet room.  If you read any of my reviews, you can tell I HEART ARUGULA.  They have a NEW salad called the Basil Arugula Salad. It's got basil arugula with orange segments and capers in a vinaigrette dressing.  I got a large salad, and it was a pretty reasonable size.  They also have a small version.  I added shrimp (for an extra cost) to my salad (which in fact -- many large pieces).  You can also add chicken, lox and/or salmon.  My boyfriend had the salmon salad with spinach, green beans, cucumber, mangoes and red onions with whole grain mustard sauce.

But Sausalito's has usurped that coveted spot by virtue of one particularly awesome menu item: their Cuban sandwich.\\n\\nI initially thought of going here because, in addition to colleagues, a very prominent musician from the festival recommended it. I initially went here because my local friend was instantly sold on the idea of a Cuban sandwich. I initially intended to go just once but went every single day: Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. All to order this fabulous sandwich with perfectly griddled bread, unctuous roast pork, and well-melted cheese over the ham. It's a treat I never get to have in my hometown. And even at $9.95, with free chips and salsa included, plus beans and rice on the side, it's a tremendous meal that is much more convenient than trying to eat a whole (and more expensive) pizza by myself or trying to grab some friends away from the onslaught of bands and merchandise to go out for lunch.\\n\\nNot to mention the owner, Ernesto, is extremely friendly and appreciative of his customers and will recognize you every time you come back.

They have a private lot and there is a decent amount of street parking as well.\\n\\n+ Neighborhood \\"feels\\"- despite the semi-swankiness of the decor, this place truly feels like a neighborhood bar. The people seem to know each other, there are kids playing in the parking lot, etc.\\n\\n+ Drink Creativity- In a cocktail-crazy city, it's nice to see some new options on a drink menu.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Menu Variety - usually, I have a hard time choosing what to order at restaurants because I want several things. In this case, however, I had trouble choosing because I really did' want anything on the menu. There were about ten options, and not a single item looked good to me (So... by default, I ordered the burger- how could that be bad?)\\n\\n-Flavor - Everything I tried was bland. Even the garlic aioli. How do you make aioli bland?? The food wanted flavor. While I was unsure of whether it would make a difference or not, even a dash of salt would have been nice, but I couldn't bring myself to insult the chef by requesting it.\\n\\n-Venue Size- very small. Not good for groups. \\n\\n-Inattentive Service- Despite the small size of the restaurant (and resulting small number of tables), our server was barely present. He came to take drink order, take food orders, and deliver the checks, and that was it. Another gentleman delivered our food, and I had to grab another waiter just to refill my water (which had been empty for a solid 15 minutes.)\\n\\n-Price- You are looking at a minimum $15 for dinner, and that is for the most basic menu option. The more expensive dishes are in the $25 range. Having now seen and tasted five different dishes, I just don't believe they are worth the price. \\n\\n- The altar in the room- the giant TV but he bar is totally incongruous with the restaurant feels. Considering the size of the space, the TV accounts for probably 20% of available wall space (yes, that's an exaggeration, but goodness, it feels that way.)

Went yesterday for Saturday brunch. We had a reservation for 10 people and were quickly spirited to our table in the back. Brunch is my favorite meal, so I was excited to eat in South Boston with some of my favorite peeps.\\n\\nFirst, we ordered a round of drinks. There were a lot of mimosas, bellinis and espresso martinis going on. Even one dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives! Whatevs - it was after Noon! After our first round, some of us switched to the pail of prosecco where you get a bottle and 4 juices to mix your own (orange, peach, grapefruit and blood orange). I wasn't pleased with my original bellini, but I think it was because the peach ended up at the bottom and I didn't mix it, so the drink was kind of bitter. When I made my own, I used blood orange and was happy. I tried my friend's espresso martini and it was awesome! I'm not a coffee drinker, but I liked it a lot. Kind of frothy and sweet with a kick. I think the table ordered about 8 of those, several mimosas & bellinis, beer, 2 prosecco buckets, etc. We went all out!\\n\\nFor food, I shared the meatball appetizer with a friend. They were to die for! We got 3 big meatballs and 2 pieces of bread in a little skillet. The meatballs and sauce had a nice kick which made them flavorful. They were also very tender. I was happy with that choice. We were also given baskets of bread after we'd been there for a while. The bread was warm and fresh. I tried not to eat too much because I was still expecting my entree. My friends had several pieces! Ha\\n\\nFor an entree, I got the margarita pizza with prosciutto. It was ok. Not bad by any means, but nothing special. I was thinking about getting something sweeter because I started with meatballs, but none of the sweet options appealed to me. They were all \\"fancied\\" up (read: tiramisu pancakes) and I wasn't feeling it at the moment. The menu has a lot of different options - paninis, pasta, pizza, brunchy foods, but I wish they had more brunch options (can a girl get a waffle?). I guess that's too basic. It's not a diner after all - I get it.\\n\\nAnyways - meatballs, hell yes. Bread, please. Cocktails, not bad. Pizza - meh. The space was really nice. They had a whole front room and back room. Apparently, they have space downstairs too, but I didn't see it. Also, our server, Kevin, was the best! With a table of 10 drinking a lot and enjoying each other's company, he really held it together. He was attentive, friendly and even plugged in my friend's phone to charge. He also offered good recommendations when asked. He didn't blink when we gave him 10 different credit cards (though we split it evenly and didn't try to get separate checks or have him try to do it based on who ordered what. That would be torture and that ain't right!).\\n\\nI'm not in this area a lot, but people keep telling me about all the awesome restaurant options in the area.

The waffle and spinach dishes were fine -- nothing special. The ingredients and garnishes were fresh. \\n\\nWhere they lost me, however, is with the side dishes. The sides were so bad. The omelet dish came with a side of grits. The grits really had no flavor to me. Or perhaps I couldn't taste the flavor of the grits after being served flat, dried hockey pucks that they attempted to pass off as sage and ginger sausage. \\n\\nThe sausage dish was so bad that I was actually a little offended. The people in the kitchen took this food item, over cooked it, and decided it was still good enough to present to a customer and then expect the customer to pay for it. I was a little surprised that someone along the way didn't stop this dish from going out. The bacon was terrible also. Unfortunately, the slices I got weren't even edible -- both slices were like 90% fat. \\n\\nThe restaurant was very busy, so the kitchen was obviously slammed. Service was incredibly slow. I overheard guests at tables on both sides complain to the server about their wait for food. Our server was actually quite nice, she was very apologetic.

Very good peanut, btw....very pea-nutty! \\n\\nOf course, I had mezcal as my beverage and my friend ordered the Georgetown  (a bourbon drink if I remember correctly).   We both enjoyed our drink and the cheese plate a lot.   The only cheese I didn't care for was the Sheep's milk because of its earthy flavor (also known as stinky foot).   But, my friend said it was her second favorite so I let her have at it.  I loved the Blue Cheese which had a very rich flavor.   \\n\\nWe noticed a \\"Living Room\\" next to the bar and it looked like a nice place for small groups of people to get together.

We were seated at one of the bench tables outside in front of the stage with live music playing. Two of our friends were also with us, but didn't' have plans on staying so we couldn't order any Manmosas (the real reason why we came) until they left. They have a policy here that if any one person orders a Manmosa, everyone at the table has to order an entr√©e. Granted, we weren't hungry, but the avocado toast seemed like a light enough meal after the brunch we just had. Technically, we ordered this because we had to, but there were zero regrets after our toast came out. It was simply avocado on a piece of toast with tomatoes, vinaigrette, sprouts, and a sliced hard boiled end on top. As simple as it may sound, there was nothing simple about it--the avocado toast was absolute perfection. I know they're known for their sausages here, but you'd really be missing out if you passed up this dish. \\n\\nThis is such a fun place to have a relaxing afternoon with a group of friends.

With it overlooking the atrium, I fell in love with it and asked if we could have it there instead of a dark room. The dining rooms are nice and intimate, but with taking photos I worried they wouldn't turn out well. It was no problem whatsoever, though of course it probably did help that the wedding was on a weekday. ;)\\n\\nThe food was of course incredible. I love Ruth's Chris, so I knew from the beginning I wanted to have my wedding reception there. Their steak is amazing. I've only ever had the filet (if you're gonna get steak here, go big) and it's tender and flavourful. Also swapped bites with my spouse who got the mixed grill, so I got to try the chicken and the crab cake too. They're both amazing. The chicken has a wonderful flavour, even if you get a bite without the cheese stuffing. It's not overly garlicky so if garlic isn't your thing, you'll still love it. (In fact, someone in our party doesn't like much garlic but got the chicken and loved it.) The crab cake is great too. Nice huge lumps of crab meat with very little binders, only just enough to hold it together.\\n\\nAll entr√©es are √° la carte, so be forewarned. The sides are all big enough to be shared by 2-3 people, though, so if you're going for a date night, just get one side. I got the shoestring fries, though they reminded me more of those potato sticks I used to have forced on me as a kid. I think the only other kind of fry is a thick steak fry (I've had those too and they're huge), kinda weird that there's nothing in between. But I don't go for the sides!\\n\\nThe service was wonderful as well. Our server didn't hover, but she was always nearby so if someone needed something, there she was. We also never felt rushed or that we were holding anyone up. Of course for us it was a bit different since we'd reserved the space, but however long it'd been reserved, I know we did stay a little past closing but it was never a problem.\\n\\nI'd definitely go back here again and recommend it to anyone!

Their pizzas are already crazy expensive so to suddenly be spending fifty bucks for a pizza, two drinks and ice cream is nuts. Prices don't match up, and there are even misspellings - super professional, guys. \\n\\nAlong with that, they don't allow you to tip when you actually GET your order, only providing an option to tip ahead of time (why would I tip before receiving my food?), so we just don't tip because with their history of getting it wrong (and no apologies when it happens - half the time the drivers have told us to call the store instead of taking care of the error themselves). Orders are frequently wrong, missing items, etc., and the pizza is often soggy, etc. Ew. Definitely not the Hot Lips I started going to 25+ years ago, that's for sure.

The whole evening was spectacular!  We started with some house-brined olives and rosemary-roasted almonds (everyone raved), then moved on to arancini (perfectly fried, but a little undersalted - pretty much the only complaint of the night), then enjoyed a fantastic brandade, and then refreshed with two delicious salads (fig/melon/prosciutto and burrata/tomato/sorrel vinaigrette).  For entrees, I opted for a lamb dish with both roasted leg AND crepinette, served with fresh lima beans and a garlicky potato puree.  Amazing!  Both iterations of the lamb were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and it was the first time I ever ate all of the lima beans on my plate before in my life.  Mom had a duck leg with polenta that she wolfed down without hardly sharing, and dad and hubby both enjoyed a perfectly cooked swordfish with roasted eggplant and other veg that I cannot remember.  Sis had a roasted half chicken with cotija cheese and Mexican-style corn on the cob - dark and white meat all done perfectly, with delicious crispy skin.  Cocktails were hard core but delicious, and I found the wine selection (both by the glass and by the bottle) to be well-suited to the food and within a decent price range for a higher-end restaurant.  For dessert, our table tried both a \\"black forest\\" devil's food cake with cherry mousse, and a bourbon pineapple upside down cake with salted caramel sauce and gingerbread ice cream.  I was so smitten with the latter, I didn't even taste the former - I didn't want to ruin the lovely flavors that were bouncing around in my mouth.  SO good.  Service was fantastic throughout - the server read our table well and interacted with us a lot, and he totally got me in terms of wine selection and brought me something I thoroughly enjoyed.  At the end of the meal, after we had already paid and started to wrap things up, my mom mentioned to the server in passing that we were celebrating mine and hubby's wedding anniversary, and he said, \\"Hold on a sec!\\" and came back a moment later with flutes of bubbly for us all.

You can eat in the dining room that boasts one of the best views of the river in the city; get a drink and appetizer at the bar that is set up like a cozy living room or meet up with friends at the outside bar area along the river and sit in one of the oversized chairs under the stars.\\n\\nWe did a little bit of everything, starting out our night in the bar area. Canoe has a stronger than normal moscato that only enhances my typical wine side effect of giggling and hair tossing.\\n\\nWe moved on to a great dining table by the window with a river view. It doesn't matter where your sitting near the windows, the views are amazing. There is a seperate dining room right by the bar that has high wood ceilings and oversized fans. It was darkly lit as compared to the warm evening sun coming in from the windows. It looked more intimate and it definately was not as loud. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the filet with wasabi potatoes, I ordered the fish special and we shared the crab cake appetizer. Canoe doesn't offer your typical bread option, they walk around with fresh breads brought in by Holeman and Finch and each night is a new variety. I had to try the sourdough and french bread. Both were deliciously crusty and were used to scoop the spicy sauce that was used on the crab cake. The crab cake was over an inch thick and crumbled perfectly on my fork, I knew it was fresh. \\n\\nOur entrees came and while he loved his steak my fish wasn't cooked. His steak was a thick cut porterhouse cut topped with shallots and creamy wasabi mashed potatoes. He became silent after his first bite so I knew it was good! My monk fish special came in an oversized bowl that was swimming in an odd fishy broth with mussels, clams and squid. I tried to use my fork to cut the fish and it moved like Jello. I tried to use his steak knife and it still didn't cut either. Thankfully the waitress stopped by to check on us and she took the plate away with no hesitation.\\n\\nA manager came over to discuss the fish. He offered to bring me something different but I declined. I was perfectly content with my wine, the warm bread and random bites of his steak.  He graciously smiled and said \\"I will have something for you before you leave.\\" \\n\\nJust as we were closing out our check to go to the outdoor bar area, I looked up and 5 desserts were heading towards the table. This is where Canoe really shines, the desserts looked like art! The manager went over every dessert with detail and it was poetry. Plate #1: Chocolate grotto hard shell with salted chocolate mouse, salted caramel and pretzel dust. Plate #2: Classic vanilla bean creme brulee and warm brownie. Plate #3: Banana nut bread with brown butter sauce. Plate #4: Assorted seasonal fruit and 2 scoops of sorbet. Plate #5 and my ALL TIME FAVORITE DESSERT EVER: Popcorn icecream sundae with house made cracker jacks. Let me tell you, I have a weakness for treats and enjoyed every dessert but the most amazing yet odd combination had to be the popcorn sundae. It was served in a deep rootbeer mug with vanilla bean icecream, melted caramel and caramel popcorn mixed in and scattered on the plate. The mix of salty and sweet caused a bit of a battle at our table where I ended up with caramel on my nose but I still won! Even if you don't go for dinner, you have to try this sundae. \\n\\nI appreciate the staff of Canoe turning a bad dinner entree in to a sugary smile.

Granted, most of this is my fault for not taking a better peek at their menu.\\n\\nService was ... overwhelming. I have been overcoming a sore throat and really needed some hot water. They brought me a small tea cup a barely filled it halfway. I felt troublesome for having to flag down the waiter every two minutes to get another half cup refill. In the end, I requested to have the kettle kept at the table but they insisted it was a hazard. Therefore, while the waiter was attentive, he really didn't play to my needs.\\n\\nFood! We ended up ordering the yellowtail jalapeno appetizer, the eel bento box, and tuna sashimi. First off, the fish is incredibly fresh. I loved the thick slices of tuna served with a generous pile of daikon threads. The recommendation for the yellowtail jalapeno starter was great. The chef has definitely taken careful consideration in pairings -- the heat from the jalapeno, earthiness of the cilantro, and the tart ponzu sauce do not overpower the slice of yellowtail, as I would have expected. Honestly, I should have read the menu a little better because when I saw eel bento boxes, I was thinking an actual Japanese Unagi Don, and not eel sushi placed in the square molds. It was more like a miniature, one-bite version of unagi don.\\n\\nUmi is definitely upscale/fine dining Sushi, rather than the hole-in-the wall type sushi that I was looking for. Sushi House Hayakawa, which I think is a nice establishment, does a better job of bridging upscale dining and sushi in my opinion.

Grabbed my phone and did a \\"search nearby\\" on Yelp.   Bingo, Sckavone's came up and I remembered looking at their menu a few months ago and had mentally put them on my short list of neighborhood restaurants I wanted to try.  It was a slow night: rainy Saturday night in Portland  and the hostess and server were right there with some drinks, menus and specials.   I already had been  eying the meatloaf dinner plate , but perused the menu regardless and made mental note of a few other items I wanted to try if there was to be a 2nd+ visit ( already had a warm, comfortable feeling about the place). So meatloaf it was to be and the server murmured, \\"good choice\\".  Hubby had had a hankering for a hamburger so he ordered the cheeseburger with a cup of clam chowder.  Clam Chowder: Many ways to make it, and  I'm a New England bred girl so I can be a bit picky about it.  I had a taste and Yum, yum!!!   I like mine thick & creamy and this was some of the best I had had in a long time.  I only had a spoonful, but as the creamy, buttering taste melted in my mouth I declared \\" Next time we come here it's bowl of chowda and salad for me\\".  Meatloaf:  Again, so may ways to make meatloaf and I love how this comfort food is found on many Portland menus.  For me Mother's downtown has been my all time favorite, and still is for the meatloaf with beef gravy dinner.  I declare this to be my  2nd all time favorite. This meatloaf is  totally different from most of the restaurants where I have served  it.    This was more like Meatball Loaf: mixture of beef/pork and bread crumbs with a touch of Italian herbs, topped with just enough thick tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese to make me long for a good meatball grinder from back east.  The dinner came with mashed potatoes (just okay) and stir fried veggies (nice & crisp)  and the portions were ample :  This dinner was $10.00 and came with 2 good size portions of meatloaf, half of the dinner came home with me for lunch the next day.  Hubby's hamburger I was told was very good, just what he was looking for and came with generous portion of crispy fries.   I also loved the atmosphere of this \\"dinner\\"  and the history behind it ( go to Sckavone's web site\\"   I also like location of it being on upper SE Division and not down in the hard to find parking spot /trendy section of Division.

Never in my life have I had a more unpleasant dining experience than last nights dinner. Had it not been for the company, it would have been a total bust. The only thing even worth a nod was the appetizers of escargot and pate. \\n\\nI will talk about the food first because the explanation of the atrocious service will take that much longer. They need to be permanently shut down. \\n\\nI don't even know where to start..let me preface by saying, I love food, i love the act of dining, I love European style dining, all of this, however what I experienced was literally the worst experience of my dining life. I'm not over dramatic, I was a fine dining server for over 5 years, as well as a bartender. I'm not one of those industry people with no patience either, like I said I love dining out. \\n\\nThe apps, as I said were decent, everyone enjoyed them and it looked like even for the lack of even remotely passable service, the food at least would be decent. \\n\\noh so very very wrong, for one thing? he skipped an entire course, I watched him..he was just standing there. we did not receive our salad course. didn't mention it just kept right on standing there. my mussels? the family recipe, were beyond over done. 3 of us ordered them, all three ridiculously over done. The frites were under cooked. we waited another 40 min before he asked us what we would like for desert. We asked him about the salad, he looked blankly at us, and said oh, i told them to make them. \\n\\nAt no point within dinner service which was by the way 3 hours long, did he ever check in, nor did he apologize for the long wait, or the fact we had to continually ask for water, or that he dished out or dishes by calling them out..every single time. he had one table, us, he also took the other starting where you should clock wise around the table, he wrote it down. \\nbut I'm getting ahead of my self, lets start at the beginning, the only reason we went here is because they're part of the Portland dining month. They had a pre-fix meal, we went on a wed. The other server was running her butt of with the 5 tables she was serving, this guy had us, who had made the reservation. \\n\\nHere's my deal, if you're busy, if you're down a man, if you're not usually a server? say something about it, say gosh folks so sorry, bla bla bla. something, check back in, be cordial, be friendly, know that your pre-fix menu? come with a course which you completely forgot. \\ndon't roll your eyes when we ask for the pre-fix menu. don't slap down my dish in front of me after you cattle called it, this isn't Denny's. actually you know i bet the people at Denny's would do a better job. \\nnot only was he the absolute worst server I've ever seen, not only was he rude and slow, apparently he's the manager. \\n\\nHe not only gave us horrible service, where we literally waited 30 min for the check when we were the only people there besides one other table, he had the nerve to charge us 18% gratuity. I know this is standard for a large party, i get that. i as a server would have been embarrassed to have that big a balls \\n\\nlets review..rude..slow..horrible food..and an entire course skipped..and then the bill. this man should never have gone into food service or service of any kind. he should probably be a file clerk with no human interaction at all. I went to ask when the manager would be in, he says I'm the manager. I said, that's is absolutely surprising, cause you are by the the worst server I've ever had in my life, in my life..like ever. I can not ever think of another situation where I've been this upset at dinner. I said i wanted to speak with the owner, he said they're out of town. his solution was \\"would you like me to refund the gratuity\\"  not I'm sorry, never, not through this entire meal did i hear a I'm sorry, or usually things are different.  \\n\\nDO NOT GO HERE.

Our server was friendly and attentive, listed all of his favorite hot dogs (the Duck, Bacon, & Fig, being his absolute favorite) giving us recommendations on what to order, etc.  We started out with some sausage for our Pom since we needed more time to review the menu.  He came back with the dog food- perks of having a small dog.. you ALWAYS have left overs!   We placed our orders and my fiance got poutine and the Drunk Chicken (per our servers recommendation) and I got the Jalapeno Mac n Cheese (without bacon, since I'm a vegetarian), once I told him that his response was \\"OH! Me too!!\\"  Naturally, I thought that was cool and he recommended the BLT hot dog, which I was already contemplating getting.  Placed our orders and once he left I realized, this fool just lied to our face!  Yes, I was actually listening to him.  How's the Duck sausage your \\"favorite\\" AND you're a vegetarian.. hmmmm?!  Here's lookin' at YOU, Logan!  Hahaha, that aside, our server was great and our experience was awesome.\\n\\nFOOD: The fiance thought the poutine was, for lack of better words, weird.  It's not for everyone though.  I think the only part he enjoyed was the cheese curds.  As for the Drunk Chicken sausage, it was alright.  Nothing special to him; the description was better than the actual sausage itself.  We both thought the buns were out of control (carb conscious much?) again, a personal preference.  Aside from the kolache bun, I actually enjoyed my BLT sausage.   I thought it was a creative take on a veggie dog.  The Jalapeno Mac n' Cheese though?  Now that, that was a disappointment.  Didn't really have any jalapenos in it other than the 5 that its topped with.  Tasted generic to me otherwise. \\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS:   This place is PACKED, so I'm assuming it's an \\"it\\" spot (according to other reviews, they have 101 different types of beer on tap), but a bit over rated.  I enjoyed my experience there, but not sure I'd go back."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Tried Hawkers tonight for the first time.

The shop doesn't have much of an exterior; pretty nondescript red brick building. In fact, had it not been for their sign, I'd have thought we were in the wrong area. Parking is limited to a poorly paved stretch. The space inside is small and there isn't much seating in the cafe area either. I'd say max dine-in capacity is less than 10, comfortably. There's a sofa and about 4 patio tables for seating. I'm guessing most people make orders to-go or for pick up. Even so, the place is made quaint with the cozy sofa, patio tables, and artwork that adorn the walls.\\n\\nThe lunch menu includes sandwiches, soups, and salads. There are plenty to select from for each category. You can select 2 of the 3 options and make it a combo meal. For the sandwiches, you have the option of the following carbs: Multi Grain, Marble Rye, Country White, Ciabatta Bread, Spinach Wrap. The egg salad sandwich on marble rye is Linsanely good. It keeps me coming back even though I've resolved to try something different each time. And it has bacon. \\n\\nI also tried the Tomato Basil, Chicken Pablano Chowder, Spicy Turkey and Sausage Gumbo. They all tasted pretty good. Although the chicken pablano chowder was on the light side and wasn't spicy to me. \\n\\nIn terms of their confections, I dare you not to be seduced by them. They're like the Greek sirens; they beckon you to their precarious sweets. But it's soooo worth indulging. I love apple pies. SS's apple pie is one of my favorites. They're thick pies, so each slice has a hearty helping of apple slices. Their crust, coated with sugar crystals, completes the taste.

The sandwich is slightly more expensive than a regular pita - $6 for a standard falafel roll-up and $7 if you want hummus (which I do) - but it's also bigger than most falafel sandwiches.

It was very obvious when the servers wanted to advance the dinner, and that can be very invasive to the dining experience.\\n\\nService highlights:\\n- Our server was very willing to provide samples of the wine selections to purchase by bottle.

We paid our tab at the table but I completely forgot that I had opened a bar tab. I also left the pub without my credit card. I realized it at 3 AM when leaving town on a flight back to Ohio.

And thanks to the head start I get from drinking at the show, it tends to be the place that I end up doing very silly things and dancing badly. \\n\\nAnyway, this place huge. It's like the chain and buffet version of an irish pub. It certainly lacks the \\"dirty\\" aspect of most irish pubs, and being an Allston resident, is rather disconcerting. The music is top 40's, drinks are semi-pricey but decently strong, there is a cover to get in, and the crowd is a little like the fanuiel hall crowd (22 and/or tourists). \\n\\nI did not try the food, as I've only been here after shows/games. I recommend this place if you *have* to go out after that show and don't want to go far.

Luckily I'm not overly squeemish about hair, but when the bill came, NOTHING was taken off, not even a small credit for a drink or anything.  I tipped normally, and wrote on the Visa receipt my suprise that there was no credit at all.

We started with the Centex Mezze cold board. It was fine, not memorable, except for the crunchy barley tabouli which was quite good. Then the shrimp toast - the best thing of the evening. But for our main attraction, we shared the recommended stuffed squid and a couple sides - arugula salads, arugula spaetzle and okra. The squid was giant, as advertised, but it was ALL bread stuffing without any character or flavor. Just big mouthfulls of dry stuffing. Difficult to swallow. And the meat of the squid itself had taken on an unpleasant flavor. I think the dish was just poorly conceived. Maybe small squid can be prepared this way, but not a large squid. No one at the table liked it and the left overs didn't make it home. The arugula salads were over-drenched with dressing and the arugula spaetzle was just meh.

Shut the front door!\\n\\nWith a menu brought to you by longtime chef at Z'Tejas, Jack Gilmore -- my husband and I have been eagerly anticipating the latest restaurant offering at this locale.  We've been through the ups and downs of each restaurant that has tried to make it stick here and tonight we have good news to report.  If they continue to perform as they did tonight, Jack Allen's seems to have the best chance of actually 'making it' at this location that we've seen so far.  \\n\\nSince last night was the official 'opening', we weren't sure how busy they were going to be and decided to call to make a reservation.  While we probably didn't need it for the time we showed up (8pm), it might have been required earlier in the evening.\\n\\nJust like everyone out there, I have 'little things' that make me smile.  One of those things is black napkins... they have black napkins.  :-D\\n\\nI miss the original door from the 'first' restaurant.  It was removed/lost somewhere in restaurant 'two'.  It was a huge glass door that really added to the front entrance and made a statement.  Now with one regular door -- basic metal framed -- I confess it feels a little cramped and claustrophobic as you enter/exit.  They have a greeter come open the door for you, which is nice, but with the small opening it feels even more awkward with someone else holding the door open for you (it opens out).\\n\\nThe interior layout is comfortable and has been upgraded with a modern feel.  They painted the ceiling (I think it used to be red or a darker color) and it really feels much more open.  The lighting is nice.  I'll post some pictures soon.  The patio was not open tonight (too cold) but we're looking forward to coming back some evening for HH.\\n\\nI started with a cocktail:  the Tito's Sage and Grapefruit Splash.  Re-enactment:  Sip one \\"mmmm...\\"  Sip two  \\"you have to try this\\"  ..... some time later \\"you gonna give that back to me?\\"\\n\\nThe chef sent out a nice bite for us to try of the House Made Pimiento Cheese and it was gooo-oo-ood.  Fresh pimientos -- super creamy -- delish.  For an app (we had a HARD time choosing) we decided on the Deviled Farm Fresh Eggs.  Go for the Grilled Andouille slivers for $2 more.  The smokey flavor with the eggs is really incredible.\\n\\nWell being a lifelong Texan and lover of all things Austin, I can tell you everything on this menu (fried or not) sounded like something I would want to order...  And being the good southerners that we are, we understand the absolute necessity for a section on the menu called 'Chicken Fried Anything'.  Bless 'em. \\n\\nDH opted for the Chicken Fried Beef Ribs.  The bone was removed for a portion of the ribs, but a large bone (plate sized) connecting the rest was left in place.  It was covered with gravy & garnished with a chopped green onion.  The meat was tender and juicy -- almost like your mom's pot roast on a bone... crazy.  It came with a veggie mixture of green beans, corn relish, red onion -- cold, seasoned & vinegared up (you know like your granny used to make) and a pile of creamy red mashed potatoes.  Pure comfort food JOY.\\n\\nI decided on the Green Chile Cheese Burger (green chiles, jack cheese, dill pickles and jalapeno mayo) -- with fries.  I couldn't decide on russet or sweet potato fries, so they let me have a 1/2 and 1/2 portion to try both.  They were both great.  The burger was juicy and I could tell the meat was fresh.  It was huge -- more than I could eat -- served on a squarish bun that was a little sweet.  I loved it.\\n\\nI was convinced I couldn't eat another bite.   Not one more bite.  Honestly.  Then our server told us about the desserts.  Words like Cointreau, chocolate ganache and Amy's Mexican Vanilla were used like weapons against my already lowered defenses.  Unfair... low blow... we chose the DD's Magic Cookie Sundae.  All I can say about  that is it had this incredible cherry drizzle saucy goodness that I will be obsessing about until I make it back for an encore.\\n\\nOther notes -- they offer fresh canned goodies, like okra & pickles.  I bought some okra for my MIL to try.  Will report back on this soon.\\n\\nThe menu also boasts Happy Hour from 3-7 weekdays, with 1/2 price apps & drink discounts.\\n\\nThe service was perfectly fine -- attentive, responsive and warm / friendly.

When we walked in, the only seats available were at the sushi bar, which was fine. We asked to be seated at a table if one became available and got a table within 5 minutes. So we sat at the table and waited...and waited... and waited. Finally after 20 minutes, we flagged down a waiter and asked if we could order as we had been waiting for a while. He apologized and took our order, which was very simple - 3 maki, a half carafe of sake, and waters. So we sat and waited for another 15 minutes and then flagged down the waitress (our waiter was nowhere to be seen) to ask if we could at least get our drinks. She apologized, checked what our order was and brought just the sake. We figured we would just get our water when we got the maki, so no big deal and it was nice of her to take care of a table that wasn't hers. And then we just sat and waited for another 20 minutes and got no sushi and our waiter never checked on us. So finally we saw our waiter and got his attention. We asked where our food was. He said he didn't know, it should have come and he would get to the bottom of it. When he came back 5 minutes later, he said that he had not been able to find our order in the system and didn't know what had happened and that we would just have to re-order. I asked how long that would take - perhaps 15 minutes? Yes, he said, about 15 minutes. (this for people who had been sitting for an hour already!!!) I said that we would just leave as we had been here for an hour and were very hungry. He said, ok I'll bring your bill (!!!). We were flabbergasted since it seems to be completely reasonable after ignoring us for an hour to just give us the sake to apologize. However, we did drink it, so we were willing to pay for it. He brought the bill back ($4.25) and, as my husband was looking through his wallet, he said \\"oh a 5 will be fine.\\" So, thinking he would bring the change, we gave him a 5. He apologized and actually said, come back again. I work on Tuesday and I'll take care of you. (come back again!!!!! what was he thinking!) So we waited for our change, but he never came back. I guess he thought that we were going to give him a tip!!! There was no way we were going leave even a 75 cent tip after this horrible experience. I have never demanded a tip back, but this time I did. We went to the bar and explained that we aren't being cheap, but that after this experience, we didn't want to leave even 75 cents. So the bartender apologized and said of course and, after a moment's reflection, said that he would just give us the whole $5 back. So finally had someone who gave us some semblance of reasonable customer service. We will likely never be going back to this restaurant, which is a real shame as we love sushi and only live a block away.\\n\\nI understood that they were busy, but they really should have a system in place that things like this don't happen. And they should train staff to know how to make mistakes right in a timely manner. They should certainly not have someone wait an extra 15 minutes for 3 simple maki when they messed up!! And then they should certainly not charge and definitely not expect a tip!!!!"},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped by this cafe and treated a special lady to some breakfast here.

We started with delicious Watermelon Martinis and Calamari apps which were nice and crispy and came with a spicy tartar sauce. Then it was on to the main course. We had Tenderloin Steak, Fried Oysters, Delmonico Steak, Baked Haddock and Grilled Swordfish. All the dishes were prepared perfectly and the food came out on time. For dessert we shared a S'mores Chocolate Fudge Ice Cream Sundae which was heaven! \\n\\nThe roof deck has a less expensive bar menu and full bar.

I live just down the street, so it's very convenient; came in for a late lunch on a weekday. There were no other patrons inside; a man, possibly the owner, was in the back of the dining room, never looked up, or made any gesture to greet us or seat us; after waiting and waiting, I spoke up and asked if he would please seat us for lunch. We only ordered two items, which I've had many times before. We ate, finished our meal, and, once again, after waiting for an excessive amount of time, I had to actually get out of my seat, go over to him, and request a bill. He never came over once to ask if everything was okay. There were still no other patrons in the restaurant. A woman who came in for pick-up of a take-out order, also had to wait and wait for this man to help her.\\nBottom line, 45 minutes after finishing this meal, I had an explosive digestive upset; I think they are not clean in the kitchen, or the help is not washing their hands appropriately.

There are numerous scientific articles stating the scientific reasons for the love of spice, savory, & just the general chemical composition of why every loves Indian food. \\n\\nI'm just generally shocked at how good the Indian food is at iSpice for being in a mall food court! Food Courts are kind of the horror shows of all basic generic food trying so hard to please everyone by not having anything too flavorful, as to alienate the general populace. \\n\\nI always do a combo - (its only about $ 7.50) it comes with basmati rice (prepared in a huge mother daddy of rice cookers!) the Chicken Tiki Masala (mmmm Butter Chicken!), the Palak Paneer (spinach with Paneer cheese), & comes with a side of Naan bread with a desert - a small Mini cup of Kheer (flavorful rice pudding mmm cardamom).

The place was very clean, and the restaurant was about 50% filled. We were quickly seated, and we ordered. Another party arrived after us, got seated next to us, and yet their food came before ours. I was confused by this, but did not mention anything. I guess the waitress noticed the same thing, for about a couple of minutes later, she stopped by our table and vehemently apologized for our order. Apparently, our order slip fell onto the ground, so the chef did not notice that our order had been placed. We did not mind and appreciated the apologies. Our food soon came. I had the Saigon Combination (com di). For about $10, there were shrimp, pork, and beef. Although there was only one grilled shrimp as opposed to a skewer. Even though the pork and beef was already cut, they also provided me with a knife. I would have preferred broken rice over normal rice, but the rice was made fine. Overall, it was a decent dish for where the restaurant is located."},{"name":"H Harper Station","address":"904 Memorial Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I finally went to this place with my wife because she had a Scoutmob coupon. Luckily I live within half a mile of the place so at least we're supporting a local business. Here goes the list:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1.  If you're looking for a place that has one hell of a diverse drink menu, then H Harper Station is the place for you. They definitely specialize in providing service to people that like a good sophisticated drink. They have a 23 year old bourbon that runs $48 dollars. Hope it's as good as it is pricey.\\n\\n2.  Parking is excellent and if you visit in the evening I believe they have complimentary valet. It's easy to find off of Memorial Drive but some may have trouble knowing about the location due to it's off-shoot location.\\n\\n3.  A  very cool space that has a lot of potential. Using an old rail depot as a local watering hole is a stroke of potential genius.\\n\\n4.  The wait service was excellent, although we visited at 1:00 pm on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Unfortunately our guy seemed to lack knowledge of menu changes. That's a chef problem. Seems that most of the plebes of Atlanta were out shopping like the the good little zombies our government expects.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1.  The menu in the restaurant does not resemble the restaurant's online menu. Consistency is key if you want repeat customers and support from the locals. Our waiter seemed pretty embarrassed that there were changes in the menu items and that he had to come back to tell us why the pickle plate wasn't what he described or why the menu was different. He seemed to hint that the online menu was from summer. It's the end of November. Why hasn't the site been updated?\\n\\n2.  As for the food I ordered the burger, which was good but was undercooked as I asked for medium rare. I would characterize it as rare as I thought I heard it moo a few times when I took a bite. Learn how to cook to order so you don't make these mistakes in the future. Also, it was supposed to come with bacon but they ran out of bacon. . . after being open for two hours? That's complete failure on the part of the head chef to ensure that all food items are available. Not impressed at all. The garlic tater tots definitely did not impress me. I think they came from a bag, were cooked the right way, but were dressed up with way too much garlic-salt. My lips puckering themselves into the shape of a shriveled prune after two bites was a clear sign that my blood pressure was approaching atmospheric levels due to the salt intake. Thankfully water was always plentiful.\\n\\n3.  Credit card machine went down, but the waiter was still flubbing with trying to get it to work. He said it had been down for the last hour so why make us wait so long to tell us? Just do it manually or let us know right away instead of being meek when you ask if we have cash. They also overcharged us for an item which may be a computer error ($19 instead of $13 for the beef brisket lunch). Very disorganized approach to problem solving.\\n\\n4.  Definitely a task oriented staff as an eight top was ignored for a bit and the father of the family decided to ask about their drink order. Not a good sign if you have numbers that low.\\n\\nThe synopsis:\\n\\nI would like to consider this place to be a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The prices are out of line with the surrounding neighborhood. Reynoldstown, Cabbagetown, and our little section of Grant Park are pretty much blue collar, working class areas. High end drinks and food are not going to be too popular here. I hope that it improves but since it's been open for at least six months but still has these issues I'm not optimistic. I honestly don't think it will still be in operation by next summer. A lot of the other yelp reviews seem to reflect the same pattern of behavior. I'll try to make a trip here during an evening to get a better idea of the ambiance and clientele to whom they cater."},{"name":"Tavern at The Creek","address":"13769 S John Young Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Decided to come here on a Saturday night, which I literally just walked to from my home.

I came a year ago briefly to catch the last five minutes of my football game, yes they have several TVs in there where you can bet they will be showing any football games; since its football season.  Just a warning, don't expect to be able to listen in on the game because this is a bar and they do play music.  When I came in this past Saturday this place was slammed!  We were able to find seating at the bar, I would say they have about 10-12 stools maybe and then some seating against the wall.  The entire bar was packed.  They had some pretty good music playing; from late 90s to recent music and all types of geners.  The crowd didn't seem bad, it is pretty much locals and I noticed bikers go there a lot too.  I do know they have people cooking on the side during the weekends that make pulled pork and some other sides (I haven't tried) but it smells amazing.  My husband and I had several drinks and I was pretty contempt with the our total price, it was around $50 and we had top shelf cocktails, shots, and beers.  The bartender serving us was very attentive I believe his name was Jimmy.  He was on top of things and always check on us and made drinks very tasty.

The steak pepito (open-faced sandwich on French bread) was interesting--beans and nicely-prepared steak chunks on bread with a little cheese and some veggies.

Also, there is some model kitchen/sound studio looking area that, while prefectly lit, is not accessible.  I kind of wonder what goes on in that room when people aren't dining.  Is this where Martha Stewart films her cooking show?  If so, where are the arts and crafts tables?  To recap, the server we had was a nice, gay man who was uptight in that homosexual server way.

It was a scary moment. We couldn't enjoy our food because of it all and the wait staff were frantic. They were dodging children everywhere while they were double or triple sat. I felt sorry for them. They were trying their best. \\n\\nWe ended up having to leave because the same child that pushed the kid off of the playscape randomly pushed my cousin for no reason.

We immediately got up and paid our bill at the host stand and left. We did let the manager know about the misbehaved child, but we know there is little to nothing he can do. \\n\\nIn conclusion, if you have kids and you don't mind a Chuck E Cheese atmosphere, by all means go.

First the gyoza.  It looked nice, but there was no flavour and it looked like it was deep fried on one side. Probably the pan was too hot.  It could have been the style that it was made as well, but regardless, the filling was pasty and not very much inside.  Then again, it was free with the coupon.\\n\\nGyoza 2 stars.\\n\\nI had the Miso ramen.  wanted to try the basic flavour and ordered it with the spinach noodles for $1.50 extra.  The noodles were more in line with the consistency of Pasta.  It didn't have that chewy texture that Ramen noodles are famous for.  It looked like it was made from a pasta maker.  I think that if they turned it a few more times in the machine, the noodles would have accomplished that chewy texture.  Then again, it could have been the style that it was made.  Both the regular noodles and the spinach noodles had the same texture.\\n\\nThe biggest issue for both of our soups was that it wasn't hot. It was just warm and with the cold toppings like the char siu and the vegetables, it made the soup luke warm.  \\n\\nFor ramen the soup must be hot!  \\n\\nWe both ordered extra Aji Tama.\\n\\nAji tama:  5 stars!!!\\n\\nSoup: 1 star,\\nRamen noodles: 3 stars (fresh every day).\\nSoup: overall: 2 stars.\\n\\nAnd with all those Ramen shops out there.  this was one of the few that seemed to lack energy.

I dont' mean to me a harsh judge, but when you serve ramen, you must have hot broth and good noodles.\\n\\nIt seemed like they were just cashing in on the ramen craze and if they did, they have to know that there is alot of competition that people would be willing to drive to get to.\\n\\nMake the soup hotter and better gyoza and you've got a solid 4 stars."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The dining experience here is a serious matter,  well attention to each and every detail.

This is definitely a place I'll have to revisit if I ever come back to Vancouver.  My brother and his friends originally took me here to grab boba, or bubble tea (you can just call it what you want, yeah yeah~).  I thought that it was just going to be a grab and go place, sorta like Tapioca Express.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a full on Vietnamese restaurant.  \\n\\nEven though there was huge selection of banh mi sandwiches, I decided to just stick to pho since I thought hot broth would be good for fighting a cold I was getting.  Most of our party went with the pho as well, but someone did grab the vegetarian sandwich.  The pho combos come with 1 to 3 ingredients you can add, such as meatballs, well-brisket, or flank, among other things.  Everyone also went with some variant of bubble tea, which was the main reason I came here in the first place.  \\n\\nOverall, the service was efficient and our waiter was friendly.  Our waters were constantly refilled, but that wasn't even needed too much since the food came out quickly.  The bowls for pho are large, but that's normal for pho.  Overall, everyone really enjoyed their food.  We all thought the pho was quite good, with the meats adding a nice touch to the broth and the meal.  Our friend with the vegetarian banh mi really enjoyed it, so that's good, too.  As for the boba, it's a bit different than other drink places I've been to (Half & Half, Tapioca Express, etc.).  Rather than being like a milk tea, the boba almost had an ice cream milkshake taste to it.  Yet, the taste still blends well with the many flavors you can choose.  Also, the tapioca pearls are nice and chewy, but not overly so.  Definitely different than what I was expecting, but nice!\\n\\nMy only caveat is not to be slow...  I took a little bit too long to eat my pho and drink my boba.  The broth to my pho became overpowered by something I couldn't identify, so it was hard to finish it.  As for the boba, it looks like it has ice in it, so it ended up becoming slightly watered down.

When Omega bakery is open, buy a cinnabun to take with you for the 3 pm craving!  It is most likely the best cinnabun I have had in a very long time.  It is perfectly moist, just the right amount of sweet and a tiny drizzle of the sugar icing.  There is something for everyone.  I shared a table with a guy who got a steaming bowl of pho that looked pretty delicious.  It reminds me of the Reading market in Philadelphia, as a matter of fact, anyone who has seen The National Treasure II, knows what I am talking about (the chase scene where the girl jump over the counter to hide from the bad guy?)

My friends ordered Channa Bhatura, Naan, Raita, and an eggplant dish. All of these were Northern Indian dishes and tasty. I ordered the Dosa Pesarattu, a Southern Indian dish, to go out of my comfort zone of Masala Dosa. Pesarattu dosa was the color green from the green lentil flour. It was stuffed with uppuma, which is semolina, it is light, and well spiced with also roasted peanuts, and it wasn't too spicy. The server asked how spicy I wanted it, and I went with medium, to play it safe. It came with Sambar, a lentil soup, and two chutneys, coconut and tomato/chili. It was delicious. It came out so large, I thought when I first saw it, just eating it with my eyes, I will get fat. But the dosa is a thin crepe and the stuffing was not heavy, so it was actually not a gluttonous dish.We ended up eating all of the food!  The only thing we ended up taking to go as leftovers, was the rice. \\n\\nWe finished the dinner the traditional Indian way: with a cup of chai masala.

Despite that it was made in cubes, it was very flavor-less. You should definitely consider making it like barbacoa it is so much better and very traditional. Also, the horchata was too sweet almost like syrupy snow-cone sweet. It should definitely get toned down a bit and have a little more of the cinnamon taste to it.

After we show him our driver's licenses, he said that we would have to show him our passports and goes on to explain the Oregon Liquor Laws. Say what now? The last time we were in town, my husband and his friends were told at the Liqour Store that a driver's license was not good enough. We thought they just didn't want to sell a bunch a of drunk goons more alcohol.

We were immediately seated and there were other empty tables & booths. It was a good 5 minutes before our server approached the table to take our drink orders. She returned with my iced tea, a beer for my husband and waters for the kids and then took our food orders.  She did not ask if I had wanted sweetener, but as I had no luck flagging her down, I had to go to the hostess booth to request that someone get me sugar for my iced tea.  From there, she never returned.  Our food was brought to the table by two other employees and they supplied the condiments as well.  For the next 20 minutes, our server, Mandy, walked by our table at least 8 times, checking in on other patron's tables, but never came to ours.  My husband kept moving his empty beer glass closer to the edge of the table in hopes that it might catch her eye, with no prevail.  I finally got up and went to the hostess both again to ask if there was a manager on duty and if I could speak with him.  The hostess pointed him out to me and then walked over to him to let him know that I wanted to speak with him. He nodded from across the restaurant and then came over.  At the same time that he approached the table, so did our server (who immediately turned around and left, but not before rolling her eyes for my 11 year old to see).  He asked if there was a problem and both my husband and I began to tell him how our visit had been since we arrived.  I also explained that this was our first time in the restaurant and that I wasn't sure if we had done something to offend our server, because she was providing less than par service to us.  The Manager offered to buy my husband a beer, which he declined, as we were finished anyway.  The Manager then cleared my husband's plate and empty beer glass.  No apology, no 'I'll be right back', no 'I'll talk to your server', nothing.  The server came by a few minutes later with our check. We noticed that the Manager had comped my husband's meal and beer.  While this was nice, it wasn't necessary.  We are capable of paying for the meal we ate and the beverages we consumed.  My biggest complaint is the lack of customer service that was provided today. Not only from the server, Mandy, but from the Manager (whose name we did not get). It is really a shame because as I stated, it was our first time at BJ Willy's, not only this location, but any location.  We once tried to go to the West Linn restaurant, but it was too busy and with a toddler in tow, it wasn't an option for us to wait. While I must point out that the food we ate was good, the service is a huge barrier for our desire to return.  I certainly hope that Mandy is provided with additional training and/or reprimanded and the Manager has an opportunity to read this and reflect on our perception of his 'fix' to the problem that we brought to his attention.  It will only be detrimental to your restaurant if she continues to serve others as she did us today and if the Manager cannot better solve problems that arise to make the paying customers feel that their money was well spent in the establishment."},{"name":"051 Subs","address":"895 W State Rd 434","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"I was hesitant to eat here, as it's kinda sketchy looking.

I'm not fond of pickles, but everyone else at the table sure was. So, an order of deep fried pickles was placed. \\n\\nThe deep fried pickles came with a interesting house-made sauce. I can tell that everyone thoroughly enjoyed the deep fried pickles. \\n\\nNext, came our Half-Stop. It was surprisingly generous, with a side of cornbread and hush puppies. Small dishes of beans, coleslaw and fries accompanied the Half-Stop on the board. There were enough Beef Ribs, Pork Ribs, Smoked Chicken, Pulled Pork and Brisket to go around. My hubby and I dove right into the Brisket - our favourite! We were not disappointed! The Brisket was juicy and tender, with some fat on it, enough for flavour. We managed to have a piece each, but I reckon we'll be back for more! The Ribs were also very well done and flavourful. Pulled Pork tasted great. I missed out in the chicken, but I was told it was just as good. \\n\\nThe cornbread and hush puppies came with a house-made butter. Together, they were to die for.

This spot is made for group dining, with tons of large high-tops, large picnic tables on their patios, and two spacious bar areas.  The interior is swanky yet casual- like that cool spot you wish your neighborhood had.  I appreciated that they also didn't add an automatic gratuity to our party of 6+.\\n\\nFood-wise, everything I had was a-ok or better.  I started with the fried chicken and duck livers, which were solid, and one of the best values on the menu because they offer a huge portion for less than $10.  The housemade pickles (which were pickled chard stems) were the best part of the dish -crispy, sweet, and perfectly tangy.  We were disappointed that there were really no other appetizers on the menu.  The duck livers were the closest thing to a shareable dish, and liver is not everyone's cup of tea.  At our server's suggestion, we also \\"split\\" the pork dumpling soup, but soup is an awkward thing to share.

I'd actually like to give two separate reviews - a five star one for the beer selection and a two star for the food.  Thanks to Chris F for posting about the shuttle - they have now updated their website with the beer selection, menu and prices and the mention of this shuttle.  I wonder if they go to Wakefield...\\n\\nThe restaurant kind of has two sides to it - the \\"restaurant\\" side and the \\"bar\\" side.  It also looks like they might have a massive outdoor patio section.  That might up their game come springtime.  It would be great it they made it like a beer garden!  But I digress.\\n\\nWe got there at about 7:45pm on Saturday night and it was pretty crowded and although a few tables were available we were told there was a half hour wait.  So, we got a beer and hadn't even taken our first sip before we were called.  I hate that, but oh well, at least there was no wait.  By the time we left the entire place was packed, it was a real live bar in the burbs!  That music was a killer though.  I thought it was just me getting old, so I didn't complain, but apparently all you yelpers are in agreement.\\n\\nIt took quite awhile to get our food due to some kind of kitchen issue, but the waitress told us this when we placed our order and we weren't in a rush anyway.  they are new, so no big deal.\\n\\nHere's the concensus on what was ordered at our table of four - ok, but not great, it's a better bar than restaurant.\\n\\nSausage rolls - Ok, if you are really in the mood and not expecting what you'd find in Ireland.\\n\\nVeggie wrap - not bad at all and with the never-go-wrong-always-the-same (brand) sweet potato fries.\\n\\nBeef Stew - Perhaps the best of the selections.  Although it was consumed so rapidly that no one else got to sample it.\\n\\nThai Lettuce Wraps - Not bad.  The chicken was good, but the sauces were just eh.  A good option for calorie counters, I think.\\n\\nSUMMARY:  Go for drinks and eat elsewhere and don't expect an Irish bar.

I am beyond delighted to withdraw that review and rave about my recent visit to Aisha's with my adult daughter.:  This could not have been a better experience.  My daughter had a facial and a massage and I had just a massage by David.  As before I have had massages at Spas in the best cities in the country and David was easily in the top 3, ever.  How he made my body literally tingle from the inside out, I have no clue.  I'm hoping I'll figure it out in 10 or 15 more visits ;)my daughter loved her facial as well as her massage .

I purchased a 90 minute massage on Groupon.  When I got there there was a piece of paper offered to me that showed a bunch of extras.   Frankly with a 90 minute massage I didn't think I would need a whole lot of extras.  However once the massage therapist determined to do all 90 minutes with me laying on my back and then announcing that the 90 minutes was up and if I wanted to have my back done I would have to pay extra, having already hit me up for another $20 extra....i'm just really confused since I've never had a massage where your back didn't get done and I've had a lot of massages. I'm not complaining about the actual massage other then an awful lot of time was wasted on the back of my head and neck. The massage therapist was really quite good actually but I did feel there was a slight amount of bait and switch with the Groupon offer which prevented me from loving this is much as I wanted to."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Left my phone at Bangers.

Arrived right after they opened for dinner so we were the first guest. We were curteously led to our table by the window, nobody offered to take our coats, but oh well, no big deal.\\n Once we sat down we browsed through the dine out menu which had a good variety except the desserts (more to come on this).\\n The ambiance is relaxed, low- lighted, and you kinda feel like seated inside a submarine.. (in a good way).\\n The food is definitely Greek-inspired, but has it always been? I remember I came here for Sunday Brunch with Jazz a few times and it was more of a Westcoast style food. Interesting. The food is overall heavy on the salt side, and to top it off with super sweet Baklava was... maybe not a good idea... . . I had to drink a lot of water to water it down.\\n\\n We ordered pretty much everything off the menu.\\n1) white bean soup - hearty, very generous portion, had a homey feeling, something I would like to make at home on a rainy day.\\n2) Chickpea and Zhuchini(?) fritters - the salad that accompanied the dish was very good, the fritter was good, but a bit too sour for my tastebuds.\\n3) Lamb Mealballs - excellent choice, three large meatballs! Very yummy!\\n\\n For the main course, we ordered:\\n1) Albacore Tuna: generous portion again, 5-6 pieces of tuna on the bed of seasoned potatoes?? (definitely had some flavors..) the tuna was o-k\\n2) Beef Tenderloin (+$8.50): Generous size, medim rare goodness. Not the best tenderloin I had before but still good. Comes with chickpeas and mashed potatoes etc.\\n3) Lamb stew - Wow, super generous portion! I couldn't finish it after sharing most of it with my family. Had a lot of potatoes though, could have used a bit more lamb meats and less potatoes. The chickpeas are in every dish, which I don't object to as I love chickpeas, but someone else might.\\n\\nDesserts: \\n** The DOV menu only had two desserts (Baklava/Creme Brulee) and with four people, I wanted to order more variety. The server said \\"No substitute\\" but I asked anyways to see if I can substitute Chocolate Mouse for one. She intially said I might have to pay the difference, but came back and said they can do it without any extra charge! Hoooray!\\n\\n1) Baklava: I m not a huge fan of this because it is tooooo sweet for me. \\n2) Creme Brulee: Very creamy, the sugar layer wasn't too burnt, and comes with a little cookie.\\n3)Chocolate Mouse: Thick textured goodness topped with housemade Vanilla icecream. The presentation was very nice, and the ice cream was my favorite thing off the plate. \\n\\nOverall, I always have good experience when visiting Nu, the view of the water in the night time or daytime is equally amazing. Price is not out of the world (DOV $28), and Sunday Brunch is recommended for its value. Also very nice of the manager to kindly change up the dessert for us.
