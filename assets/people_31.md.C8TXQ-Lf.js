Luckily, we had a reservation and went straight to the Pager Return Stall.

I believe it's BYOB if you sit outside. Beer buckets are relatively cheap though and there's a lot of local craft beers I haven't heard before. \\n\\nBeef rib and brisket platter: each platter comes with potato salad, beans, and slaw. Bread, pickles, and raw onions can be requested. Brisket was a bit too tough for my liking and I don't think it was seasoned enough. I believe good brisket can be enjoyed without using BBQ sauce and I had to use BBQ sauce to finish. The beef ribs, however, were delicious! Slightly charred, sweet BBQ marinade.Some tough parts though, like it wasn't a \\"meat falls off the bone\\" beef rib. \\n\\nPecan Tart with ice cream: Not worth, in my opinion. I didn't think there was any flavor in the crust. We were also really full too and the dessert didn't have a \\"wow\\" factor that kept us eating despite being stuffed. \\n\\nOverall, I'm glad we had a reservation or else I don't think I would have really enjoyed my experience.

Let me start with the brisket. It literally falls off the moment the fork touches it. I could not believe my eyes, my mouth, my tongue. Everything felt like an outer body experience. It's flavored to perfection with each bite elevating you to another realm of another dimension where everything is absolute perfection. The interior feels like a cabin which honestly made the food taste even better. This was my first time eating beef ribs that were not dry. They melted in my mouth and the bones are cooked for such a long time that I guess the marrow comes out of them because each bite tasted like I was eating liquid gold. Honestly, words are not enough to describe how amazing the beef ribs and the brisket were so you will just have to drive to Driftwood to find out for yourself. I took my cousins out here because I remember having this at someone's house in Austin before but omg eating it fresh is a completely different story.\\n\\nThe chicken was good but that was the only thing that we did not really eat so I got to eat that and a slice of brisket the next day.

I thought so myself until my destination hotel was the Omni Austin Hotel at Southpark.\\n\\nAlthough I've frequented numerous Omni resorts (all great places to stay), I'll never do an overnight at this property again.\\n\\nProblem #1: If you book a corner room with a balcony, make sure the room is opposite the freeway side of the property.  When the front desk folks tell you earplugs are available... you know there's an issue.  Five minutes in said room had me back at the front desk for a room change.\\n\\nProblem #2: Don't be enamored by Southpark's \\"soothing\\" pool/hot tube pictures on the website (we booked our stay at Southpark because we wanted to relax in the hot-tub).  Since \\"staycations\\" must be the new thing in America, I found both the pool & hot-tub over capacity with minors.  Not only is this a safety concern [Omni management: read your own pool & hot-tub capacity signage], I found the majority of these children unsupervised.  As such, feces in the pool & hot-tub required a \\"shock treatment\\", shutting down the entire pool area for 24 hrs.  Moral of the story: Where were all the parents, and more importantly, where was Omni management?\\n\\nProblem #3: Pool signage says \\"No children in the pool area after 11:00 pm.\\"  What happened to the standard rule where all children need to be ready for bed at 9:00 pm?  Moreover, where did all the responsible parents go [literally]?\\n\\nProblem #4: I should have worn my bay fishing waders.  Half way through a quick shower, a plugged drain had water 3 inches over my ankles (and rising) in the bath tub.\\n\\nProblem #5: Be sure to bring a coat during the summer season.  I estimate the AC setting throughout the complex must have been a cool 65 degrees F.  BTW, standard thermostat settings (out of the box) default to 78 degrees Fahrenheit.  This default energy cost saving, in and of itself, may offset regular plumbing inspections (see above paragraph).\\n\\nI'll for sure stay elsewhere on my next trip to Austin, especially when Omni Southpark management did not provide their promised discount, to me, for all of their inconveniences.

The bartender wouldn't make the featured drink on the bar (\\"that?! We don't make that anymore.

She was nice and tried but really missed easy opportunities to make it right. She comped us the drumsticks and awful drink. \\n- manager: we asked to see the manager when, at the 90 min mark we FINALLY got our bill. I watched him be told we wanted to talk to him, then saw him go the opposite direction and basically try to look busy in the hopes we would leave. I pointed him out when we were walking out (after watching him avoid us for 10 min) and we caught him going out the door.

SO GOOD. i'd give it a 6/5 stars if i could. \\n\\na couple of months ago, a friend came to visit from out of town, so we figured we had to take him to salt lick. we made the drive from san antonio at 8pm and when we got to the restaurant, we decided on the all you can eat option. at that point, the place was pretty empty, but there was still lots of meat cooking on the pit. when the food came out though, lots of the meat was cold and dry. certain plates were better than others, but overall, it was terrible. my friend didn't understand why we thought this place was so good and i felt bad for making him sit in the car for 3 hours for some horrible bbq. :[ it was probably because it was getting to be the end of the night and the food just wasn't fresh, but if they're going to stop cooking, they should let us know (i called before we left to make sure it wasn't too late to show up and to see if the kitchen would still be open and they made it sound like it wouldn't be a problem at all). i'll probably still go back at some point to give this place another chance because it was so good the first time, but probably no more out-of-my-way trips in the future. this was a 1/5 experience.\\n\\ni figure the average of the two experiences comes out to about a 3/5. \\n\\np.s. the first time i went, i bought some original salt lick seasoning. i used it to dry rub a steak but it tasted horrible -- nothing like anything they have on their menu. i also found out that they sell their seasonings at some HEB stores, so no need to make the drive out to driftwood!"},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love this place!

The short rib was tender but was a little bit dry, maybe been braising a little too long. Good though. \\n\\nHogzilla -- of course they had to have one with pork belly! It was tender and fatty. The taste is similar to Glen Rhee actually. I think its because the pickled veggies weren't at their peak pickleness.

And no lie there was a scoop of maple butter on top the size of a scoop of ice cream.  French fries were good but why they need to call them 242 fries must be some kind of inside joke or meaning & must be annoying for servers when all guests for sure ask what 242 means and they reply - NOTHING.  Just call them French fries for goodness sake. Service was on point but the wine list was sooooo \\"tried to be edgy\\" that all 100+ beer and wine choices were unfamiliar to me which is rare.   Anyhow - Will return for sure.   And who is the chef or kitchen guy that wears a bright red ski hat mid shift in the dining room?

Where's lunch? Help Yelp! \\n\\nIf it weren't for my Yelp app, I would have never, ever found this place on my own. It's at the end of a little plaza without any flashy signs or banners on the main road. But this, my friends, is Yelp gold! I'm not sure if this review will do this place any justice at all, but I'll at least try. \\n\\nThe second I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly face and a Brit accent. I took a gaze around and was immediately upfront, \\"I don't think I've ever experienced this type of food before.\\" Nick (I believe was his name) was truly amazing- from the second I walked in, until it was time to go. \\n\\nHe helped walk me through their pie options, his favs and my questions. What! They have Scotch Eggs? This is foodie fun I've only seen on the Food Network but never in the WILD wha wha I'm in! \\n\\nI was so excited to be here so I grabbed a steak and Guinness pie and a Scotch Egg for in house and a chicken curry pie to go. Along with one of their local sodas, uhYUM! \\n\\nThe Scotch Egg was exactly what I thought it would be. It tasted just like its ingredients: sausage wrapping a boiled egg then deep fried. It was a little odd at first but hey, it's not like I have these bad boys on the norm. But the experience itself was pretty cool. \\n\\nNext, the pie. ErMyGerd! I took my first bite and then literally had to sit back in my seat and reflect on my awesome lunch decision for the day. The pie was flaky, buttery (but not too much), and surprising PACKED with meat. One pie is very filling and the  flavors :O I don't even have words for! Just so so good! \\n\\nI actually texted a past coworker of mine that us from England to get his take on this place, actually more to inform him of its existence since I doubted he knew about it since it's so small and far. BUT wait! He knew exactly where I was and comes here all the time praising it over and over! \\n\\n\\nBeing here wasn't just about the amazing food, but the staff as well. I felt so touched by the guys here. It made for such a rewarding experience and I highly suggest, if you are in the area or just looking to step out of the mundane, come in and if nothing else just take a look around. They have lots of local items, a cool little seating area and just really good energy. It is an experience i will soon not forget! \\n\\n.....not to mention I just ate the chicken curry pie I took home for later.... yeah I'll need to get more of that STAT! Be curious, give this place a try  and you won't leave disappointed. You'll thank me later!

There were highlights and disappointments. The cheese plate starter was very good with quality cheeses, honey and fig accompanied by a toasted bread. The field greens salad was bland with a tart and somewhat sour biting dressing. A highlight dish was the Hogfish plate which was exceptional with a well seasoned sauce and perfectly cooked squash. The big disappointment was the Ribeye and baked potato. The ribeye was just that, a Ribeye with no seasoning or flavor, plain tasteless with no seasoning at all for $45. You could grill a better Ribeye at home for a fraction of that cost.  Service was on point at the beginning of the meal but less than halfway through our waiter became disinterested in providing and form of service and never asked if we enjoyed our dinner or experience."},{"name":"Standard Hall","address":"1100 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"After just a couple of visits to Standard Hall, I was hooked! The place is so fun that I decided to celebrate my birthday brunch with them and now it doesn't feel like a Sunday Funday without a quick visit for a Boozy Pop (as also display in my profile pic on almost every social media account I have lol)! \\n\\nFirst, can we just pay homage to their AMAZING bloody Mary bar. By far one of my favorite ones in Columbus. Probably dangerous but the only thing that could make it better is an unlimited option. If you're a fan and you haven't checked this out yet - RUN next weekend for this alone! And if you're not a fan of bloody's - go for the boozy pop or the manmosa (think oj, orange vodka and a wheat beer) we are big fans. Next time we pop in, I want to get one of the boozy lemonades and add a housemade peach puree, the girl sitting next to me had this and it sounded amazing. \\n\\nTypically any meal for me is the sweet option so I usually go for the french toast sticks which are rolled in cinnamon toast crunch (THE CEREAL) and have brown sugar whipped cream (drool) but at our last visit, I let the husband talk me into something different so we went with the Nashville Hot Chicken Biscuit. We got it Big Nasty style which came with an egg and gray. I thought we ordered Mild but based on how spicy this was, we had to have gotten the spicy one (thank goodness for the boozy pop's to cool my mouth off). And this was the kind of heat that was hot but didn't lack in flavor (ya know, where it's so hot that all you taste is hot). This was hot but so juicy and flavorful. \\n\\nNext time you're looking for not only a really yummy Sunday Brunch BUT a fun spot that you really have no desire to leave, hit up Standard Hall. And if you didn't catch my drift throughout this review - get a boozy pop ;)"},{"name":"Sea Thai","address":"3812 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Orlando... though that's not really saying a lot.

My friend was unsure about the ambiance when we got in, but I actually really liked the vibe. You feel like you are not in Boston anymore. It was dark and tiki themed and just very unique. The drinks, although expensive were very good and we each had a few cocktails. Where Tiki Rock falls short is with its food. We both love tuna tartare... neither one of us could even eat this one. I had a couple bites but just could not do it. It was flavorless and very meaty and it is the first time I have ever not enjoyed that dish. The crab Rangoon's were great. The mushroom dumplings were just ok. The sushi roll we got which I am forgetting the name of now- was disappointing. The bill was surprising when it came - for a few drinks and appetizers I could not get over the price.

I had always heard wonderful things and somehow, had never gotten around to trying it. We decided to come here to celebrate my daughter getting her driver's license and even let her drive me...a hilarious story for another time. We showed up at 9:30 on a Friday night and were seated immediately. \\n\\nOur server was a pleasant young lady with a warm smile who noted our wobbly table right away and promised to come back and place a shim under the short leg. Unfortunately she said it three more times during the next three visits to the table as if it was the first she'd noticed. After we reminded her again, after nearly spilling a glass of wine, she sent someone over and it was remedied. \\n\\nThe space is dark and divided into a couple of main rooms with some smaller rooms for parties. The kitchen area is partially exposed and the wood burning oven is the centerpiece of the main dining room. The noise level is a bit high, but understandably so given the size of the room and the number of hard surfaces. \\n\\nThe menu is divided into appetizers, primi pasta selections, secondi or main courses and house specials. We were not hugely hungry, so both decided to just order a main course. The server brought out a basket of freshly baked bread with what, in the dim light, appeared to be seasoned butter, but was in fact a white bean spread (I think). It would have been nice to be warned in advance so my palate would not be expecting butter, but taste beans. \\n\\nMy daughter had the spaghettini carbonara - house made pasta with pancetta in a cream sauce with a poached egg on top. It was very rich and creamy and plentiful. I ordered the hangar steak with fries, Parmesan roasted tomato and spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly and was tender and flavorful. The fries were certainly plentiful, but entirely too salty for me to enjoy, as was the spinach. I do love a generous sprinkling of kosher salt on wilted spinach, but this was too heavy handed in my opinion. The Parmesan tomato was delicious, bursting with fresh tomato goodness. \\n\\nThe wine list was extensive and I enjoyed the valpolicella immensely. Overall, I was satisfied and every restaurant can have an off night. Also, what is too salty for me, may be perfect for you. I wish I had ordered the lasagna, but hindsight is always more acute than foresight. I would give it 3.5 stars for this visit, but I rounded up since that option wasn't available."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Surprisingly filling even though everything is shared and some of the portions are not the biggest, this is because of the BREAD.

Im all about getting that bread and eating that bread. \\n\\nI also got the salty pig sandwich because I am also a salty pig so why not try it myself. it was a pretty big sandwich so I shared it with my friend. It comes with chips and thats it. The sandwich itself is filled with meat and veggies, very filling for a pig (me). \\n\\nLastly, I ordered the margherita, weird name but I mess with this. it was pretty big and there wasnt too much bread or too little sauce, everything was perfect.

I think the crust was the best part. The sauce, basil and the cheese were all good.  I'm glad they use lactose free cheese since I would be in the bathroom now instead of writing this review. \\n\\nIf you're a garlic fan, you can use their garlic condiment (freshly chopped garlic) to put on your pizza. It makes it taste so much better. But I'm biased since I'm a huge garlic shill. \\n\\nThey have other condiments, and I saw people go to town on those condiments. Maybe they do make the pizzas taste even better? \\n\\nThe pizzas are huge. 2 people can probably finish one pie. But if you are girly, you might need 3 people to finish it. But you can always take them home.\\n\\nI also tried their Sfogliatelle. It was pretty awesome. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. They should turn down the music a bit though.\\n\\nYou can also peek into the kitchen and watch them make the pizza. But it looked like they were nervous when I was watching them. They kept looking over their shoulder at us. \\n\\nIs it the best pizza I've tasted? I'm not sure. I think the numerous 5 star reviews made my expectations to run super high.

These two flavors worked together though.  The thai rolls were tasty too.\\n\\nThe gra prow chicken was AMAZING.  The sauce was a little darker than I'm used to however its probably due to a little molassis being thrown in.  Dont misunderstand though, its not sweet.  It just adds a certain background to the flavor palette.  Yeah thats right I said flavor palette!  The masaman curries smelled delicious and the pineapple fried rice was well accepted.

There were a couple of times where food was auctioned and the waiter got a little upset at them because he placed the food with the wrong person. Meredith, Tony Maw's (owner of Kirkland Tap and Trotter) wife was very nice and pleasant with a bubbly personality. \\n\\nWe had some special needs with the kids (no gluten and non dairy) and the chef was accommodating and may variations of the same foods so the girls could eat too. Mainly, the first course of granola topped with fresh foods and nuts instead of yogurt, second course - no cheese on the burger, and no buns, and 3rd course - one generous scoop each of 3 different sorbets instead of either chocolate decadence cake with white chocolate ice cream or the panna cotta. \\n\\nI had the pork belly fried in batter with eggs sunny side up and pigeon peas. What a beauty that was. Tasted great. Batter was light and brown. The peas were rich and wonderfully a complied with the eggs. Normally I'm not huge on eggs sunny side up but this was great!

Outdoor bar and seating area, indoors there are at least two bars, and three main dining areas. There is also seating out of the back with a water view. We had called ahead and were seated fairly quickly. The noise level is a bit loud, I think due to the low ceilings. The main area where the host stand is almost too loud.\\n\\nWe were greeted by our server quickly and ordered the table side guacamole and a pitcher of house margaritas. Also for signing in on Yelp you are offered a shot of Tequila, so my hubby took advantage of that quite happily!  \\n\\nMargaritas are okay. Not the best I've had and a big disappointing for a restaurant that has over 200 tequilas to serve. The guacamole is served mild, medium, or hot. We chose medium. Filled with ripe avocados, tomatoes, onions, and jalape√±os, it was perfect. Their Rocco chips have a bit of spiciness to them, and they perfectly complemented the guac. It is served in quite a large bowl for sharing, but it didn't take us long to make a large dent in it for sure!\\n\\nI ordered the Baja plate, which includes a fish taco, shrimp taco, and a goat cheese and spinach quesadilla. The shrimp taco was my favorite, but it only had three shrimp in it, which was a bit of a let down. The fish taco was okay, fish was overcooked and tough. The quesadilla tasted just as you would expect. Creamy goat cheese and spinach. Nothing spectacular, but it is as listed.\\n\\nMark got the Brooklyn tacos which he enjoyed very much.

Our server wasn't too bad, however he just failed to explain key details to us in the beginning like: for fried shrimp instead of saut√©ed shrimp was an extra $2, their system \\"isn't set up to split tickets into separate orders\\" therefore we all had to cash app one person our money to pay the entire bill. He goes on to say \\"all of y'all are family and this is a family restaurant so y'all should pay as family. Our system isn't set up to do all of that splitting checks! First off we're not family, but we're like family and all of our checking accounts are different family or not! So I thought that was pretty unprofessional! also he wasn't able to take our orders unless we were all ready because he has to take the orders by seat. Meaning the person in seat 1 had to tell him her order but the person in seat 2 wasn't ready but seat 3 was, he wasn't able to skip seat 2 because he had to memorize the orders by seat numbers. So he couldn't skip seat 2 go to 3, 4 and so on he had to take the orders in a row starting with seat 1. Because seat 2 and seat 5 wasn't ready he had to leave and come back. Instead of taking the others orders. By the time he wouldn't taken seat 1, 3 and 4 orders seat 2 and 5 would've been ready. But he couldn't skip. This was the first time I've heard of that before! But anywho! Like I said the food and ambiance was cool, but until they get an updated 2019 system that allow them to split checks, I won't return!"},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Three words: Twice Baked Brioche!\\n\\nI was on a business trip in Boston and one of my friends recommended I stop by Flour Bakery + Caf√© to order their Brioche.

Worth visiting if you're around the Dr Phillips area."},{"name":"Universal Orlando Resort","address":"6000 Universal Studios Plz","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Entertaining park(s).\\n\\nMost of what needs to be mentioned are in the other reviews, so rather than be repetitive, I'll try to be a little different. \\n\\nUniversal in Orlando is really one large park (excluding the water park), but they decided to split it in two and of course all that comes with it (two admission prices). Both parks are entirely doable in one day if you get here early and it's not insanely crowded - think Disneyland/California Adventure, which is the same way. \\n\\nUnlike Universal Hollywood - which has the real studio tour, while this one doesn't - this Universal is much larger and naturally priced higher. They have some similar rides/4D's, but there's a lot more to do here at the end of the day. As much as I enjoy the Disney parks, Universal is personally my favorite as it appeals to my movie buffness. I've been to the Hollywood version a few times and was happy to finally come to this one. \\n\\nUnfortunately on the day I went, it rained badly for a long period and we had to miss some stuff - so at least I have stuff to do on the next visit.\\n\\nThe parking garages are huge and it costs $20 - you can pay more for \\"preferred\\" parking, but if you get here early enough you don't really need it. Before you go into the parks, you walk through the CityWalk - which in itself is pretty cool and free. \\n\\nDepending on how many days you're coming for, the time of year, and how fast in the parks you are you have the option of buying a two park ticket or individually. Even with the rain, I was able to do a large portion of what we wanted. If you do your research and plan, you could do both parks (sans the water park) in a day. \\n\\nSome rides/areas get crowded early on - so that could be a good thing as you can do other things in the parks without as many people around. The Harry Potter area crowds the most currently, so large portions of Islands of Adventure and the Studios area were rather empty, which was great. \\n\\nMy only gripe is the park hopper - you're forced to ride the Hogwarts Express to go from one park to the other. If there is another way, I have no idea. I don't have issue with the \\"ride\\" itself - as it's very well done - but it's the amount of time it takes with the lines. I easily lost about 2 hours - on a day I lost half of due to the rain - just waiting on line to get from one park to the other. There should be a better way implemented. I spent a lot in the park and on the tickets themselves and losing that much time to go from one to the other is not acceptable. I brought up Disney/California Adventure - because with them you can just walk across the street really. Would be nice if they made the same option here.  Took me no time at all to go from one park to the other, but here it ate up way too much time - valuable time at that. \\n\\nThere are various themes and rides here - Islands of Adventure is basically a circle, so you can start from one end and get to everything. Again, the Potter area gets the most crowded(currently), so plan accordingly. \\n\\nPlenty of eateries and shopping to do (also in City Walk) - but everything is theme park priced, so be warned. \\n\\nThe character meet and greets are always fun. The ones under the costumes are always impressive. There's parades and such at various times in the Studios part of the park. Staff was generally very good throughout the parks. \\n\\nObviously if you're visiting Orlando, this is one of the main reasons. I chose to stay at an area hotel, but I assume if you stay on the resort there are perks to the parks. Local residents also get perks and can go on less crowded times of the year. If you go during one of the busy times, expect crowds and all that come with it - rudeness, smelly, zombie-like, oblivious, and all. Don't let people ruin your time, especially with all the money spent - bring a bottle of patience and enjoy your time in the parks. \\n\\nOverall a great time - even despite the weather and crowds. We did miss some things due to the weather, so there's more to look forward to on the next visit. Great place for both children and adults. As much as I will look forward to coming to Orlando and going to Disney again and all, it's Universal again that I'm looking forward to the most.

The guy that brought my order literally shoved the bag through my window before I could roll it down all the way. He did not say anything to me because he was too busy carrying on conversations with the other employees that were congregated in the parking lot. I looked in the bag to see that 2 of the boxes were upside down and that there no napkins, dinnerware or condiments. I called number on the receipt, asking for the manager. He said his name was A. J.  He said he would speak to the guy that shoved my order through my window. I asked him if there was anything he could do about my order and the service I had received. His response was, \\"what do you want? what do you expect me to do?\\" I told him that if he didn't know how to make it right, then Chili's does not deserve me as a customer.

The margaritas were watered down (tasted no alcohol) and while the glasses look large, 85% of it is filled with ice. The guacamole was the only food item that I felt was above average. All our entrees were huge- definitely meant for at least two people (three if you aren't too hungry). My friend's cobb salad wasn't even mixed together- literally all the different ingredients were brought out on a giant plate separately (so weird).

Their smoothies are so good they'd prompt Jack Lalane to Zombify himself to figure out what juicer they're using, and the Chai teas are the best thing this side of Burnside -- or Bengali.\\n\\nThere are couches and tables scattered about, meaning you'll never have a shortage of comfortable seating. Additionally, there are large windows, so you'll have a great view of the rain coming down, the (largely-absent) sun pouring, or the motorcycle cop that hides behind the power transformer outside and nails the unsuspecting drivers on McLoughlin. I find this fairly entertaining, and routinely spend several hours making bets on who will get those expensive tickets (which inevitably are used to pay for what must be an immense amount of vomit clean-up at the transit mall nearby).\\n\\nThe walls are festooned with art and photographs from nearby schools and studios, and generally have some sort of sub-theme, but usually stem from three main larger themes: \\"Look pensive in a B&W picture,\\" \\"Flowers,\\" or \\"Pretend you're Basquiat.\\"\\n\\nThe wi-fi must be incredibly good/fast here, as there are people that seem like they've been parked there for ages (and I'm pretty sure that several small business owners run their establishments from here).  Seriously, there is a woman there every day with a laptop, iPod, iPad and auxiliary keyboard and I'm pretty sure she's the CEO of the Adidas campus in Portland.  There was once a group of five people playing warcraft, and I heard them shout in elation upon completing their [Less'rabi] achievement, and one of them exclaim, \\"The wifi here is so good we were able to get our rogue kicks and shaman wind shears off with no problems!\\"\\n\\nThe bathrooms are clean, and well-lit, so you won't miss a beat if you plan on reading the entire time you're at the place (I finished up book #2 of a duo-logy I was reading in there, actually).\\n\\nTo be honest, though, I don't like organic coffee.  It seems somewhat acidic, so I usually resort to \\"foofier\\" drinks, which are the coffee shop equivalent of Oprah's \\"Me Time,\\" and sprinkling rose petals around your bubble bath (which should first be encircled in lots of vanilla-scented candles).\\n\\nCafe (side establishment): I've been picking up food to-go at the new cafe they have, that is adjacent to the coffee house.  The services is pretty quick, you can get beers (or wine, if you want), and a panini, a great sandwich or a rice bowl.  The food is varied, and quite honestly, the price and taste are comparable to New Seasons, so if you work or live in Milwaukie, you might as well save yourself a trip there.\\n\\nI guess it bears mentioning that the staff here are comprised of really attractive people.

When the dish came, it smelled so yummy. I took a bite, and i was disappointed. We had requested for spicy, and it wasn't.  I asked our waiter for a side of pepper, but he didn't know what I was referring to.  I described the standard chili thai chili with fish sauce and cilantro etc. He still didn't know what I was referring to, but he told me he would inquire and bring me a side of pepper.\\n\\nWell, he didn't return to our table.  I could barely finish 1 wing, so I read up on the Yelp review and some reviewers said this location was not as good as the other locations. \\n\\nI finished my drink and then requested the host to pass PokPok's cookbook, so I could show him what pepper sauce I was referring to.

The positive yelp reviews helped a bit too. The owner explained to us that they only specialize in a few dishes, which was fine by me. I love Japanese curry and they specialized in it. You got a happy girl right here. We ordered both Kal√© rice with chicken and the Kal√© rice with beef. The beef dish definitely had a richer and more flavorful taste with more of a spicy feel to it. I was still pretty satisfied with the chicken dish though. They also offer tea as opposed to water, which was awesome. It gave it more of an authentic feel to it. \\n\\nTheir place is kind of difficult to find. I couldn't find their name on the front of the restaurant. Only did I walk in and find a Japanese setting that I figured we were at the right place. If you cannot find it, do not be deterred. The food is worth it. Keep looking!

The steamed cabbage was good, the rice & peas standard issue, and the plantains varied in their sweetness levels.\\n\\nI recommend going earlier in the evening since they can run out of some selections. The seafood choices seemed pretty popular. \\n\\nWill have to return to Island Taste sometime to try out the patties and ackee & saltfish!"},{"name":"Red Lentil Vegetarian & Vegan Restaurant","address":"600 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"Wonderfully creative, delicious vegetarian and vegan cuisine.

We were all starving by the time we left Universal Studios and this place certainly filled us.  The seafood pasta is the Wednesday special at only $12.99, which is a bargain. You can choose diablo or Alfredo sauce and it comes with bread.  The diablo sauce was my choice and it did not disappoint.  It was mildly spicy, but did not overpower the seafood's flavor. My daughter has the mild chicken wings, which were smaller than what she is used to having. She said they were pretty bland, so I'd recommend a different sauce.

We arrived at 5:45pm on a Tuesday, sans reservation. After throwing us a look of disdain, hostess told us  they were fully booked.  Surprising as it was early, and all of the tables except ONE were EMPTY. I asked about the tables in the bar \\"those too were reserved.\\"  I told my wife we'd go to Rendezvous, just down the street, which we love. On cue, the hostess said that we could have a drink and see if there is a cancellation. Since the few bar seats were the only things occupied, they told us that we would have our drinks standing on a cramped, ramp by the bar area.This was an awkward and uncomfortable location. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks, which seemed excessive given the emptiness, after receiving them, the hostess told us that they had a cancellation. We were seated at 6:15. The cocktail was very good. Unfortunately things only got worse from there.  Bread - disappointing, as it was stone cold. We are foodies. So when I say that I enjoy trying new things, I mean it. However, this menu was so full of odd and unappealing choices...Starters:1. 6 Wellfleet Oysters - Being from Boston, I can get these at any of a hundred restaurants, and for less money. At $18 (the price for all first courses - main courses are all $37 - which btw, I think most people would agree, that at those prices, it is fair to expect to be \\"wowed\\" by the food, and the experience) I want something that has been impeccably prepared by the extremely talented and award winning uberchef. Not something that I can get at any local shuckhouse-Pass 2. Crispy Fried Pigs Tail - Interesting to try if I were, say, buying from a Thai street vendor in Bangkok, but come on, if you are going to take the cheap, scrap parts of the animal, which in many cases would have been thrown out, and offer it in tiny portions for twenty bucks as an appetizer, then you should do more than deep fry it.-Pass 3. Ragout of mushroom, pork heart sausage, and Cock's Combs. Cock's combs, really? I mean is this what haute cuisine has come to, offering the most undesirable, shocking, gross-out animal parts, so that the diner can brag to his friends that he ate Cock's combs? ...or is this the only way to make the margins work nowadays in upscale restaurants? Maybe that's it, maybe the only way to make bottom line in the restaurant business is to buy crap cuts for practically nothing and sell them for exorbitant prices. I dunno, but either way not for me-Pass. 4. Crispy Fried Main Clams - Come on $18 for a fried clam or two? You have got to be kidding in this town! I can get the greatest, freshest, tastiest, crispiest, heaping, plate of fried clams with homemade tarter at the Busy Bee diner on Beacon St in Brookline every Friday and Saturday for $12.95! not to mention any Legal Seafood location and any of another 1000 restaurants in Boston!-Pass    5. Fusilli, goat, sweet potato, brussel sprout leaves - Maybe I should have gotten that, might have been good, although goat can be a strong flavor for some. And once again, it seems to be a case of using the cheaper cuts-Pass 6. Beet and Pigs Ears Salad - Really? Pigs ears? The only salad on the menu, really? (\\"What about that beautiful looking salad with frisee we saw being eaten at the bar?\\"-We asked. \\"That is only available at the bar\\"-reply.) Pigs ears is what my aunt has a giant bag of, as treats for her dog. Once again, as adventurous as I am, I'm not paying twenty bucks for a bite of pigs ears and raw beet-Pass 7. Soup of butternut squash - grilled cheese and pork belly sandwich - This is what my wife chose after learning they would not serve her the salad she saw at the bar. This was the high point of the dinner. The soup was very tasty, seasoned heavily with Indian Spices. And the grilled cheese was tasty too, albeit much too small of a portion, it was a small slice(several inches) from a sandwich . Good bread, good cheese, and the pork belly although hardly visible, added a nice flavor. Let's be honest though, you are not going to a restaurant of this acclaim, reputation, and price level for grilled cheese. And come on, twenty bucks for a vegetable soup appetizer? Please! 8. Grilled Spanish Octopus-This is what I chose as my starter. What arrived - a single Octopus tentacle about 5 inches in length. The Octopus was very tender, which is good. The taste, however, was not bad, it was just wholly unremarkable. The dish was simply several bites of underwhelming and disappointing mediocrity for twenty bucks! Not worthy!  Service was slow, especially since it was empty note; after we were seated at 6:15, the next party to be seated was at 7:00 Main Courses;My wife had theSea Trout-tiny in portion size. My wife said it was ok, nothing to write home about. My dish was a duck breast sliced & fanned in a little pool of blood red \\"pomegranate\\" sauce. I like med rare steaks, rare tuna and sushi, but this was RAW-dark red all the way through,bland...."},{"name":"Lime Leaf","address":"435 Columbian St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4.5","text":"I love lime leaf.

We were seated fairly quickly and then something strange happened....everything on the menu looked AMAZING.\\n\\nRarely has my mind changed so much, but it took staff to guide us to their best selling crowd pleasing dishes for us to get our orders going.  Here's what we got:\\n\\nPeach cobbler french toast ($10.95)\\nSouthern breakfast ($10.95)\\nBreakfast potatoes ($3)\\nCoffee ($2.25)\\n\\nSo, let's talk about the Peach cobbler french toast.  First, yes, it sounds AND looks amazing.  It seems like it's going to be a dessert, but staff were correct that it really wasn't as super sweet as you'd think it was.  This treat comes with vanilla butter, crumbles, peaches and a peach sauce, tons of cinammon all decorated with powdered sugar for a two bread sliced dish.  Flavors of the cobbler were really good.  I ate everything on that plate, though I have to admit that I wouldn't order it again.  It's a little much for me.\\n\\nBreakfast potatoes, which were also mine, were diced and cooked with peppers, onions and chives.  Enjoyed the flavors of these as well!\\n\\nThe southern breakfast gives you lots of options.  Two eggs cooked any way you want (she got soft scrambled), bacon or sausage (she chose bacon), grits or breakfast potatoes (she got grits), and a biscuit, white or wheat toast.  I didn't try much of this, but I will say that the grits were great.  Everything else was slightly off, from the eggs to the biscuit\\n\\nLocated off of Ivan Allen Jr. Blvd, parking at the front of the lot is small. By comparison, seating here is pretty spacious, with lots of seats....many more tables than parking in the front. Customer service was pretty helpful, both in giving us their recommendations to dishes and just providing good service.\\n\\nI had Atlanta Breakfast club bookmarked, and was happy that I had a good time here.

The Sangria is odd, no real red wine that I could taste. The Sangria was like a weird semi sweet cocktail.

Located on the 4th Floor of the Hyatt at the Orlando International Airport (your elevator ride up to the restaurant includes a view inside the airport), McCoy's at first glance looks like your standard airport restaurant. The interior is a little dated (probably looked nice about 10 years ago) with 2 levels of tables and booths with a bar and televisions on the second level.\\n\\nThe hostess took us to a table in the back area. Our server came out soon after. I can't remember her name, but she was very polite, made great recommendations, and generally did a good job. \\n\\nSince it appears that not many locals stop in for Magical Dining, we had to ask for Magical Dining menus. While waiting on those menus, we looked through the restaurant's regular menu. It's MCO Traveler's Trio (3 dishes for $19) looked like a really good deal, and many of their menu items looked rather tasty. We then looked at the drink menu and saw some very fun options. I decided to order the Frequent Flyer, which is one of those expresso and Bailey's type of alcoholic drinks. While I knew I'd like the flavor of the drink, what really impressed me was the fact that the drink came in an actual glass rather than a martini glass. Places seem to love to cheap out on cocktails by providing cute yet small glasses, so I really appreciated getting a full-sized drink.\\n\\nWe then proceeded to put in our Magical Dining order. While we both ordered the NY Strip and Frites as our main dish, I ordered the Strawberry Goat Cheese Bruschetta and Almond Macaroon Tower as my starter and ender, while my wife ordered the famous Crawfish Chowder and Lemon Cheesecake. Right after ordering, our waitress brought out some amazing bread (part of which we saved to make sandwiches with our leftover steak the next day).\\n\\nWhile it took a little while for our food to come out (ok since we were local, but wouldn't have been good if we had a flight to catch), everything that came out was fantastic. My wife's Crawfish Chowder was very good (albeit too spicy for me) and my Bruschetta (which has balsamic on top) was fantastic. Both of our steaks and fries were fantastically cooked and seasoned, and the desserts (which we boxed up and ate at home) were well-designed and rather tasty. \\n\\nOverall, McCoy's provided a solid dining experience.

Anytime you get ready to go there, be prepared to spend a few hours there since it's a long drive, it's usually packed, and there's always a wait.  It also feels so safe there knowing there's always a sherriff's car(s) parked there to help out with the crowd control and potential riot breakouts (not to mention free bbq as well).  I mean with the recent handgun law passing you can never be too sure, right?  I'm glad to see our taxpayer's money being well spent!  \\n\\nNow back to that bbq - - Salt Lick is BYOB which is awesome, so bring a cooler w/ your own brew.  I absolutely love their ribs the best, the sausage is good too but I get sick of it real quick, and the brisket is pretty good most all of the time.  They give you plenty of sides to scarf down - love the potatoes, slaw, onions, pickles, and jalepenos (they're $0.50 a piece!).  And their sauce - OMG!  Now I know why it tastes so good - - it's soybean oil based so every teaspoon is 15 grams of fat bbq lovin' but that don't bother me none!  I just end up fasting all week long so I can make up for it at Salt Lick!  \\n\\nThey also have a hot mustard sauce (which you have to ask for) which is pretty good as well.  I recently went there noticed how they no longer have sauce pitchers at each table, but instead bring it in a bowl w/ a plastic spoon (boo hoo).  Why?  The waitress said they implemented this months ago since they lost a lot of the containers and were running out of them.  Who cares?  Still great bbq!  YEEE HAW!  \\n\\nBut it will hit your pocket book - - it's $19.99 for all you can eat and I walked out paying $27 (including tax and tip) + iced tea.  OUCH!  (and it will hit your intestines later in the night - be prepared to wake up several times to hit up the porcelin poddy). Oh - BTW - CASH ONLY (we always forget this) - - so don't you forget (unless you want to pay the $2.75 ATM surcharge!).

Similar to slime but wayyy more watery. The only way it's barely good is adding black beans and guacamole to it making it a cowboy vegan queso. Queso shouldn't have toppings added to taste somewhat ok. The beans and guac helped mask the watery tasting cashew queso. And it's the only vegan option so no one knows how bad it is until you're forced to order that thinking oh cool. That may be good. Also doesn't it make more sense for chilaquiles to come in a bowl rather than a plate?! And how does a salad take so much longer to come out for a Kerbey kickstart rather than the food that has to be cooked for several minutes. Kerbey is going down hill.

The ambiance is standard industrial/hip/uncomfortable. The food was blah -- we ordered the ribs, quail, caesar salad, and sweet potato dip. The sweet potato dip isn't actually a dip -- it is just a thick paste in a bowl with broccoli and arugula and 4 greasy tortilla chips to \\"dip\\" in it. It was best mixed up and eaten as a salad, but still bland. There is no vegetarian entree so one member of our party, who occasionally eats seafood, asked the server if the mussels could be made without chorizo. He replied \\"You could just not eat the chorizo.\\" Thanks, dude. The quail was laid to rest on a bed of....something....thick, white, mildly sour. Maybe a creme fraiche? It was the consistency of cream cheese frosting but otherwise unpleasant. The caesar salads were plated to leave half a plate empty -- all the salad just on one half-circle. Maybe they were trying to make it look like there was more salad? At this point we were laughing at how dumb it all was. The ribs were the winner by far.

We had heard such good things about Rocco's Tacos. We dined in on Tuesday night for a friend's birthday. (Taco Tuesday!)\\n\\nATMOSPHERE (3.5/5): The music is loud. The only people I could hear without trying to read lips were the people seated directly next to me. My husband gave this place the nickname \\"Club Taco\\" because of the loud music. However, the decor is pretty cool and trendy. It was pretty busy. Plan accordingly and get reservations if you can. If you're looking for a quiet meal, go elsewhere. Good luck finding parking during peak dining times.\\n\\nFOOD (4/5): I can't say the food is bad. It was decent, but for the price, we were left wanting. They don't offer complementary chips like other Tex-Mex restaurants. The salsa was actually pretty good. Apparently they are known for the table side guacamole - didn't get to try it on this visit.\\n\\nThere is a $15.99 all you can eat taco entree, where they bring you four tacos of your choice initially and bring three additional tacos each subsequent plate. All the tacos were pretty good. I was able to try all the tacos between my husband and myself. With the group of nine of us, our food came so slowly... My tacos were lukewarm when I got them, but it would have been another 30 minutes until I got my replacement.\\n\\nWe skipped dessert because someone brought a cake.\\n\\nDRINKS (3/5): My margarita was so watery. It tasted like someone poured the mix and then dumped a ton of tequila on top. There is an offer for a FREE shot of tequila - all you have to do is check in on Yelp. \\n\\nSERVICE (2.5/5): Our server was slammed. She had five tables with large parties (between 9 - 12 people), so she was constantly running around. This probably accounts for the bad service reviews people complained about. I won't fault our server with the lousy rating for service. \\n\\nMy husband is highly allergic to shellfish. It's a pretty easy allergy to deal with - don't order anything with shellfish in it. He orders some tacos and twenty minutes later his plate of unlimited tacos comes out. The runner simply asks: \\"Did you order tacos?\\" Obviously, my husband says yes. Thank goodness he checked before eating, but the runner has brought out someone else's order with shrimp tacos. It would have been easier to avoid any mixup if the runner had just mentioned what kind of tacos the runner had on that particular plate. So we waited, and our server brought out new tacos another twenty minutes later.\\n\\nCommunication seems to be an issue here. Another issue was the food temperature when it reaches the table. I wasn't expecting sizzling tacos, but I expected hot food. We figured out that if you order food individually (as opposed to a group order), then your food comes faster.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd think about coming back.

It definitely has that old world neighborhood charm of a pub.  Folks are pretty friendly here.   Walk-in and wait for someone to direct you to a table.  Seating can be cramped, especially when busy.

Before you go there, here are a some very important tips. 1) it's cash only 2) no reservations and there's always a line out the door, especially if you go at a peak time with nice weather 3) they will rush you. I once ate a meal, split a bottle of wine with my date and we were out in 27 minutes. literally. If you're looking to take your time and have a longer experience, my advice would be to either go somewhere nearby for a bottle of wine and appetizer, then go, or simply choose somewhere else. For option A, cantina italiano is a good option. Sit at the bar, have some antipasto and a bottle of wine, then head to Giacomo's for your entree. You can keep an eye on the line from Cantina - it's across the street. 4) the waiters and waitresses are salty as hell, but they're also characters. Have fun with them and you'll enjoy the experience. If you're sitting at the table texting away on your phone, they will tell you to put it away. As you should. Some may see that as rude - if you're that type, go somewhere else. They won't kiss your butt at Giacomo's. There's a line out the door looking to take your spot.  5) It's cheap and the food is absolutely amazing. I've never had a bad meal there. 6) The wine list is also very reasonable for this neighborhood 7) they don't do coffee or desert. There are plenty of cafes nearby.

I will say though the portion was a little small in my eyes and had I not had some appetizers (which the waiter was kind enough to suggest) I would have been hungry.

Some Cuban dishes, some Peruvian, some Columbian. Of course some dishes are stronger than others, but everything I ordered was tasty. \\n\\nGrilled Skirt Steak - My skirt steak was extremely tender. So tender that I could have swore that my steak already split open before my knife hit the surface. The meat is well seasoned and their chimichurri sauce matches great with it. Comes with red beans, rice, and a lot of plantains (5 pieces!). At first it came out more on the rare side so they were happy to throw it back on the grill for a minute to get it to medium rare. What I like on their dinner plates is that you can choose between green plantains, ripe plaintains or cassava. \\n\\nSauteed Cassava (Yuca Guisada) - I usually go with fried cassava but Pio Pio also offers something different, they can pan cook their cassava with tomatoes and garlic. The cassava is very much like eating potatoes, but slightly more stringy. When I bit in, it was tender with the tomato's light tartness giving the dish a good punch. I still prefer the fried version (personal preference), but if you have been looking for the sauteed version, they did that very well. \\n\\nCaipirinha - This Brazilian cachaca based drink could have been better (I make them often at home). It was missing something. More lime and some more sugar probably would have helped. This is the only item from the day that I wouldn't recommend. \\n\\nIf am back in the area, I would come to try their rotisserie chicken. That looks delish. \\n\\nPio Pio is a good place for all kinds... Family, friends, date night, or even for an enjoyable business meal.

There are two locations in Atlanta: this one in Inman Park which opened October 2011 and a newer location in Westside which opened April 2016.\\n\\nStreet parking in the immediate vicinity, including N Highland, is free. There's also a pay parking garage across the street in the Inman Quarter development. Complimentary valet is available every night and during weekend brunch.\\n\\nThis is a stylish restaurant. The atmosphere is relaxed and you can come dressed up or down, though it's a safer bet to go with the former. Wood everywhere. When it gets busy (which it often is), it gets loud. The patio is a happening place to be -- what's a drive through Inman Park without seeing lots of people dining outside Barcelona? The bar inside is large and there are a variety of tables and booths for parties big and small. This is equally a good place for a candle-lit date as it is a festive group gathering.\\n\\nWe stopped in for dessert, so unfortunately, this review only covers dessert. I'll post a review update if I come back and try their regular menu items. The dessert menu had seven desserts:\\n\\n* Chocolate Hazelnut Indulgence ($7.00) - coconut mounds ice cream\\n* Panna Cotta ($6.50) - Luxardo cherries\\n* Churros y Chocolate ($8.00) - served with dark chocolate dipping sauce\\n* Crepas Salguero ($7.00) - dulce de leche, chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream\\n* Assorted Ice Cream ($7.00)\\n* Flan Catalan ($6.00)\\n* Raspberry Sorbet ($5.00)\\n\\nWe ordered four of them: panna cotta, churros and chocolate, crepes, and ice cream. I asked our server if there was anything special about \\"Flan Catalan\\" and he said nope, it's just flan.\\n\\nAll of the desserts were delicious. If our table took a vote, I think the panna cotta would win as the best of the four. It was silky smooth, sweet, rich, and creamy. I highly recommend it.\\n\\nThe churros were served fresh from the fryer; hot to the touch. These were some of the softest, most airy and delicate churros I've eaten. They were terrific alone or with the chocolate sauce. One of my friends enjoyed eating them with a glass of red wine.\\n\\nThe crepes were my personal favorite item. Light, flavorful, and the dulce de leche flavor was quite distinct and tasty. Very good.\\n\\nThere were a few different flavors of ice cream available. We went with coconut. Three scoops are served to an order. The coconut ice cream was yummy. It had lots of real bits of coconut which made the ice cream chewy, but enjoyably so.\\n\\nOur server went MIA throughout the night. That wasn't cool.

The bun, a slightly sweet, pale round pillow of goodness that was soft, yet a little chewy all at the same time. It wrapped up a couple slices (chunk like slices I might add) of braised pork belly. The pork belly was tender, a little fatty and had that earthy sweet flavor that was all about loving on the pork! I had a curry chicken bao that sported panko crusted chicken with a curry sauce that was phenomenal. The chicken was juicy, succulent and crunchy and again, being wrapped in a pillow of goodness, was just plain yummy!

Cannot understand people who say that the food is bad or people there are rude. It's nothing but a lie, possibly paid for by their competitors. They are very friendly and helpful. Also, it seems that some people review this place as if it was a VIP restaurant in a 5-star hotel, and expect the same level of service and menu. It was a small cafe and it's at least strange that most people seem not to understand this fact. If you like, go to a VIP restaurant and pay 5 times more, it's your money, but don't say that Panda was bad. It was especially ridiculous for me to read a review where someone said that after ordering food for $30 he was still hungry. Excuse me, but HOW MUCH CAN YOU EAT???? When we ordered something, usually around $20 was enough to get food for TWO and we couldn't eat it all at once, it's enough for two meals at least.  Of course, if you only order the most expensive foods, you won't get too much for the same amount of money, but it's not the problem of the restaurant, it's your choice!

Unfortunately, I only like you as a friend. *sigh* Don't get me wrong, the food here is good and super fresh, but after waiting in line for almost two hours on a hot Saturday evening (we arrived in line at about 5:13pm) I cant say I didn't expect better. I don't mind waiting in line for food. Heck, I made my boyfriend wait with me while he complained there were so many other places around, but I'm a serious foodie and he wasn't going to mess this up for me. Now I had been waiting to come here for about 3 years and read the review numerous times, even when I was not in the boston area. Once we were seated, my feet took a sigh of relief and we were greeted by this really nice tall waiter (like someone else said he looked like he was from the jersey shore) but was so attentive and kind to us the entire time, even though every table was packed! The restaurant is really small, so we were basically sharing a table with another group which seemed weird at first, but I didn't really mind (I was in a good mood and just so happy to sit down). The waiter quickly took our orders and drink orders, and everything came out quickly. We got the caprese salad to start, which was so refreshing you could just taste the freshness. Then we got the garlic bread, which was pretty well done, so I just ate the top and kinda ignored it after the first piece. Also the starter bread wasn't much of a winner, just very plain white (sourdough maybe?), not warm, and honestly Bertucci's has better bread so I was put off by that. For dinner, I got one of the specials with mussels, lobster, linguine and garlic cream sauce. So good, but I wish the lobster was a little less over cooked. The claw was fine and perfect, but the body was much tougher so that was slightly disappointing. My boyfriend got something with penne, chicken, shrimp and pesto cream sauce and that was SO good. I ended up wishing I got the pesto cream sauce instead, but I think it may have suited his dish better anyways. Also, the bill was only $72 for the two appetizers, two glasses of wine, and the two meals! Overall, did I expect better? Yes. Am I mad I waited 2 hours in line to eat here? Absolutely not. For me the experience was more special than anything, and the atmosphere was very lively, but if I'm starving and craving Italian food, I can't say that I'd be going out of my way to come here due to how busy it is on any given day.

The sweet potato biscuit was no normal sweet potato biscuit, which I had gathered from the small text beneath it, but the server was looking out and asked if I was sure I wanted it since there seems to be enough surprises when people get a biscuit slathered with peach jam, country ham, and egg and they just wanted the biscuit.

We came one rainy night (which is every night now), for a late dinner.  It was crowded and the atmosphere was very homey, and the background music was phenomenal.  We ordered the communista plate, the avocado salad, and the yucca fries.  I think there was a server-foul in not reminding us that the communista itself has a ton of yucca fries.  So, we were yucca overloaded.  The avocado salad was, well, avocado, which was too much avocado for either of us.  The communista also included black beans and rice (the best part of the dish) and cabbage cole slaw.  We also shared a mocha dessert from the cooler, which was tasty, but a bit chilled (unsurprisingly) for my liking.

This might have been some of the biggest sensation I ever tasted on a rotisserie chicken in a restaurant.

I've been to many Tiki bars. I seek them out and just love everything about them. From the tropical drinks that taste like vacations that I can't afford to the relaxing theme and the music. It's like being transported from a barstool to the beautiful islands of Hawaii.\\n\\nI was very excited to take my wife to Tiki Rock, which is only six weeks old. We waltzed in and sat at the bar and were greeted by a friendly bartender and a menu. We ordered away: an Our Thai ($15) for me and a Painkiller for the wife ($15) and both drinks were pretty tasty and nicely garnished... but didn't feature a signature, ceramic Tiki cup.\\n\\nWe downed those and proceeded to get a second round: I went with a classic, my go-to, something I've had hundreds of times: a Mai Tai ($14) while the Mrs got a Saturn ($13). A different bartender made these and she was nowhere near as friendly as the other guy. It was to a point where even my wife gave me that \\"what the hell\\" look.\\n\\nAll in all, the place has potential but it's just not there quite yet. They need those signature Tiki cups. They need a better food menu, which in its present state feels very much like an afterthought, especially if you don't eat fish or seafood. They also should bump their prices down a bit, because it got real expensive real fast. It was well over $70 for 4 drinks which is damn pricey, even for downtown Boston. \\n\\nMost importantly, they need to work on consistency of service. Our first bartender was awesome, the second one, not so much. Oh and every time I tried to ask for recommendations, they defaulted to their 'Rum Barrel' cocktail which is $22. C'mon, how about you work with me here and actually focus on what I like and not what's most expensive? I specifically said that I wasn't very into Falernum and it's a key ingredient in that drink...\\n\\nThe potential is there and hopefully the tweaks will happen. I look forward to trying it again, in a while, and hopefully the Mai Tai will be improved as will the attitudes.

Overall I thought it was ok but nothing outstanding. Instead of the typical bowl, they have a box setup with a base on one side, two \\"sides\\" on the other side (I picked seaweed salad and spicy crab salad but they also have edamame), and the poke in the middle. To me, the rice took up too much space in the box; I had quite a bit left at the end. As for the poke mix, you get to choose up to 4 different scoops, but it seemed like smaller scoops (perhaps equivalent to 2 at other places). I chose the ahi tuna and salmon and was satisfied by the quality and freshness. They have a good amount of toppings to choose from. The thing that disappointed me most was the sauces - I chose the spicy ponzu and the spicy ono but couldn't perceive much flavor in the bowl, so there was a lack of a unifying element pulling the separate ingredients together. I also was less impressed by the sides; the seaweed salad was less crunchy than I would have liked and the crab salad was less tender than usual. Maybe not the freshest? I'm not sure. The free miso was a nice touch and I like the miso dispenser.

This concept is so so cool, it made me feel like Orlando is keeping apace of culinary meccas like NYC or California or Miami. Major props for coming here go to my friend and work colleague Jamie (She isnt on Yelp.. yet!) who was in town for work from Memphis. She voted to come here and I am super glad we did.\\n\\nBTW, in case you aren't aware of what a Bao is, it's a Chinese version of a sandwich, and a very popular street food in East Asia - you can sometimes also find it on the menu in Taiwanese or Vietnamese restaurants. They are super easy to eat - just pick one up, take a bite and chow down -  No utensils needed!\\n\\nA bao's texture is soft with a tinge of sweet, and if left out too long, the bun can mutate into an incredibly rubbery, chewy and dense wrapping. It reminded me of a lily-white marsh-mellow the first time I saw one.  The dough is also not baked, but steamed - so think of the Bao as a hot, warm, pillow-soft, steamed bread roll with a filling of meat or vegetables. \\n\\nThe menu choices at King Bao were innovative and I really enjoyed the puns. After looking at the menu for a looong time (there was a board with daily specials too), Jamie and I both decided to get the 3 Bao Combo, which for $9 gets you a Drink & 3 Baos - note it is $0.75 extra charge on top if getting a seafood choice as part of this deal. Jamie also got an order of Truffle Tots ($3) to share. \\n\\nMy choices from the menu were: Hogzilla, Mr Potato Head & OMG aka Oh My Grouper and Jamie's 3 choices were: Inner Harbor, Firecracker Shrimp, and OMG. \\n\\n1) Hogzilla (single piece cost is $3.50) consists of thickly cut pieces of pork belly braised in a deliciously tangy sauce with pickled carrots & daikon. The bao was then finished off with ground honey roasted peanuts & cilantro as the garnish. The taste was divine! Salty, Sweet, Smooth, Crispy! Oy vey - I loved each bite. \\n\\n2) OMG \\"Oh My Grouper\\" (single piece cost is $3.75) consisted of Grouper pieces, dredged in Tempura batter and lightly crisped so that the fish inside was just perfectly cooked. The accompanying condiments which were kim chi slaw, yuzu tartar sauce & scallions, added spicy and citrusy notes and there was just the right amount of mayo to temper all the flavours. Another winner in the taste department for me.\\n\\n3) Mr. Potato Head (single piece cost is $3) fillings consisted of a beautifully crunchy and soft sweet potato croquette with the accompaniments being sour cream & roasted corn relish salsa. For me, this combination just beautifully melded so many cuisines - it reminded me of Polish pierogis with one bite, then in my next bite, I was like no, this is American Southern food with the sweet potato and corn combination, and then another bite would make me think it was more a play on French-Vietnamese cuisines with the croquette and relish elements. Just honestly brilliant.\\n\\n4) I had a bite of the Inner Harbor Boa (single piece cost is $3.75) which consisted of a thick meaty piece of Maryland style crab cake, alongside Old Bay mustard aioli & scallions. Again, each bite was just so lovely and perfect - there were good chucks of the crab and the mustard aoli was perfect foil to the crab.\\n\\nI also want to give a shout to the space -- the graffiti elements made the dining room very urban and hip. Also the pun and wittiness of the drawings in the napkin case holder was another surprise and delight! I'm also giving them a 5-star inspite of one sour note - our tables were super sticky and I wish they'd wipe down between customers with more water and a green cleaner, rather than using that ghastly-smelling chemical cleaning spray.\\n\\nOther than that, I loved all that I ate here and will very happily get all my choices again. In fact, its really really hard for me to distinguish which one was my fave. Maybe Mr Potato-head by a very very small smidge? \\n\\nYou can tell that the chef is using good quality ingredients, and you can really taste the love and joy of food in the menu choices, as there is so much layering of flavours and components, starting right from the Bao itself. \\n \\nI am definitely planning to come back and want to try and eat everything from the menu!!\\n\\nYelp 118/2018"},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, killer menu and great vibe.

This Exquisite room of Zen has been decorated to be soothing and calming. An eight-course meal professionally made by Executive Chef Yoshifusa Kinjo would arrive adorned with beautiful flowers, edible Greenery, and fish cut to perfection. Splurging on such a meal is an understatement you get exactly what you pay for. King crab salad with apple vinegar exquisite. Miso Grilled Black Cod alongside of Sea Whelk, a Salmon Terrine, Fried River Shrimp, & Broad Beans, delectable. I am now graced with a three-point Sashimi plate that has Japanese Snapper, Marbled Tuna and a Grunt Fish.  The next course would be Chawanmushi which is a traditional Savory custard. When I think there could be nothing better than what I've already had I'm presented with a family style share plate which would consist of Miso Grilled eggplant, assorted Tempura and skewers with sea salt and Teriyaki glaze.  A sushi course is served next  followed with dessert which will be green tea panna cotta. The experience within itself is timeless and priceless. This three-generation owned restaurant is a definite go to in the heart of Atlanta.

At the bar area in the back of the restaurant, the bartender tells me to wait another 5 minutes to get my order. After getting back to me, she runs my card and hands me the receipt and goes back to prepping and totally forgets that I was even there. Lousy customer service even if I am only picking up an order.\\n\\nSo the dish I ordered which was a Rigatoni Salsiccia for lunch. The original description on their main website was \\"Homemade style rigatoni pasta with Italian sausage and sweet onions, in plum tomato sauce topped with ricotta cheese finished in brick oven\\"\\nWhat did I find? 3 slices of cold soggy bread, a small greasy round dish of Rigatoni with like 20 pieces in total, 5~7 giant pieces of sausages with chewy cartilage clumps in it (had to spit out 2~4 small bits). In the middle a GIANT clump of ricotta cheese which took out an overall 65% of the dish and the rest was tomato sauce, grease, sausages, and the Rigatoni itself. \\n\\nHow much did that dish cost?

Naturally, Miso came up (no way/see review) as did Craft which is a tempid version of a true Japanese experience with pre-packaged gyoza singing sadly in the fryer.  Meh.  Next on the list was this absolutely GEM of a Japanese restaurant which I had never heard of.   To be honest, the charming video with the graceful granddaughter of the original owners is what sold me.  3rd generation owner/operator?  Done.  \\n\\nAs Uber dropped me off, I was initially cautious, concerned that the \\"Habachi\\" cooking of it all could be a harbinger of a mistake on my behalf.  Flaming cones of onions?  Flying knives and shrimp?  Uh oh.  \\n\\nSure, the BGO room of birthday songs, silly drinks, split checks and mounds of food was humming along with underdressed patrons getting delightfully Roman at the bacchinal.  \\n\\nBeyond that revelry, I found a true oasis of traditional Japanese dining replete with perfect service, high quality ingredients perfectly prepared in the most traditional manner and a tatami/kaiseki experience that rivals Kyoto.  \\n\\nI was truly gobsmacked by the overall experience.  Almost every plate was perfectly crafted.  Each taste reminiscent of the best kaiseki I've had.  The only shortcoming (thus the 4 star) was that the sashimi plate wasn't as amazing as everything else.  It was fine and totally average, but was the clear weak link in this otherwise perfect experience. Small slices. Just ok. \\n\\nI have already told everyone about this lovely place and look forward to returning to this little pocket of Japan in this sometimes inhospitable town of BBQ, bad service and all you can eat wings.       \\n\\nI met the granddaughter after my meal.  Even more charming than the video.  \\n\\nSee you soon, new friends."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food is excellent but the customer service was terrible. The waitress dropped a raspberry beer (the color of red wine) accidently over us, which was fine because mistakes happen.  The beer covered our pants, my phone, my purse, got in our water and our napkins- it was a big spill.  We were very understanding because people make mistakes and she obviously didnt mean to do it, however the wait staff was not very apologetic. They also did they comp the drink or give us a free appetizer for the inconvenience.  Drink service was also very slow, which I understand because it was a busy night, however we still could have had better service.  We had two friends who were going to join us so we asked politely if they could pull up two chairs.  The waitress told us that we could not do this because there were no empty chairs.  When the 2 additional people arrived, there was a man sitting alone with 2 free chairs.  We asked if we could borrow them and he said that would be perfectly fine.  The waitress came over to say that this was not acceptable and that while she would not \\"kick them out\\", she would if she needed to use the chairs.  The rest of the time, the waitress was extremely rude, even though we were paying customers who were extremely inconvenienced by being covered in raspberry beer.  When she delivered our check, she also pointed out that we could not separate the check because of our party size and that there was going already 18% tip added.  This was very tasteless to point out due to the evening's circumstances.

I'm not exactly sure whatever happened to Rocco, but if he somehow became a restauranteur with a love of calavera-esque decor, then he ended up doing quite well for himself! Rocco's Tacos is an energetic and inviting place that serves up a good meal in an atmosphere so awesome that it almost overwhelms the other positive aspects that make up a visit here.\\n\\nMy folks actually stumbled upon this place years ago and loved it so much that they insisted we all need to go the next time we were in town. Whereas most people have Disney, Universal and possibly a local death metal band on their lists of \\"things to see in Orlando,\\" we had \\"that tequila place with the amazing guacamole.\\" We made our way here on a mid-afternoon one Monday and even at that time, this place was quite a trip.\\n\\nWhen you walk up, you'll find all sorts of artistic pieces on display to take a picture with, thus fulfilling your tourist duties. (I'm not at all ashamed to admit we did.) There is an outdoor bar/lounge area here, while the main entrance is just to the right. Once inside, you'll find a team of welcoming hostesses, a couple of dining rooms behind their desk and a shelf of bottles that kind of looks like the Library of Alexandria in tequila format. Another bar is to the left, occupying both the inside of the place, and the outside where the patio stretches the length of the building. We opted to sit outside and it was a fantastic choice.\\n\\nOur server, Eric, was over in no time, and he was exactly what you want in a server: engaging, knowledgable and attentive to his tables. He got us set up with our order and we prepared to dig into the rightfully famous tableside guacamole. Is it the best guacamole you have ever had? It will definitely be up there, and there is a reason this stuff is a staple of many visitors' meals: it's pretty doggone tasty.\\n\\nWe followed up with spicy beef tacos, shrimp tacos and Brooklyn street tacos, which were kind of like meat lovers tacos on steroids. Everything was delicious, and we did our part to polish our plates cleanly. Add in a margarita that looked devastating, in a good way, and a modest selection of beers, and you have the makings of a solid not-quite-lunch/not-quite-dinner meal.\\n\\nSo why four stars? This timing of our visit may have worked to our advantage in that Rocco's was not busy, but it also may have meant servers were spread thin. Eric was fantastic, yeah, but I'm thinking the bar may have been overwhelmed with requests. It took a noticeable amount of time to get a Bohemia beer over to our table, for example.\\n\\nBut the biggest challenge Rocco's has to overcome is the sheer number of places that do tacos better back in the Dallas, Texas area. If you've never wandered into some of the hidden gem taco shacks in the Lone Star State, Rocco's is an easy five star place. But if you have visited some of those other establishments, or your favorite hole-in-the-wall taqueria, you'll know what I mean.\\n\\nStill, Rocco's is an excellent place to grab a beer and bite to eat. We even saw some guys in penguin onesies at the bar - we never did figure out what that was all about, but they were having a good time. Also, while we're on a stream of consciousness rant, the bathrooms here had \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" playing on the TVs. So, clearly, everyone here has a great sense of humor and makes for great company.\\n\\nCome for the food, stay for the environment and make plans to return - Rocco's Tacos definitely deserves to be in your regular rotation of restaurants."},{"name":"MADdogs Gourmet Hot Dogs","address":"1900 NE 162nd Ave, Ste D114","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place is AMAZING! \\n\\nIf you're craving a hot dog this is the place to go.

I cut in and completely raw and flavorless.  No sorry, no comp, no manager after a return. If I had to compare the food quality i would say Dennys or maybe even fast food.

Not much later, our buzzer went off and we were seated.  It's a very nice looking place with modern decor and a friendly staff.  My youngest son ordered a children's pancake & sausage meal (surprised it was sausage OR eggs, but whatever).  My oldest son (who had better be successful when he gets older due to his expensive taste ordered the benedict oscar (steak and crab), the wife got a crab cake benedict, and I got the banana's foster french toast with sausage and eggs.  \\n\\nFor the most part, all of the food was really good; the only issue was the temperature.  Nothing was hot.  The French toast was borderline cold; the saving grace was the hot maple syrup that I poured on it.  Everything else was just luke warm.

I find it disrespectful when places don't make the time and minimal effort to properly advertise important things like hours. Both the website and the door say 5pm.

When we went to pay our bill we all had 20's because this place doesn't take credit cards and we had just gone to the atm. We just needed a few 10's. When we asked for change for 2  20's the woman said no and said she will get us change for one and walked away. my jaw dropped. um if you want to get paid and want a tip especially, then you should get us change and what kind of attitude is that?? The attitude seems to be the door revolves so quickly that if you aren't happy so what. Maybe you should take credit cards if this is an issue. It's not like we asked for a bunch of singles or nickles. It was taking us a while to try to pay the bill and we were irritable at this point so she did give in and offer to get us change to get us out of there it seemed like.  A good restaurant does not rush you, especially when you are not dawdling, and other people here commented on feeling rushed so that is not good business.

Talk about a mistake.\\n\\nWe were the first (and only) people to arrive at this restaurant,  as it had just opened for the day. Perfect, we thought, no wait! We were ravenous, and wanted food pronto. Anyone who has frequented Park Ave. on a weekend knows how packed everything can get, and that probably should have been our first clue to steer clear of this place.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately, and our waiter was nice enough. He grabbed us drinks, and then said he would give us a minute to look over the menu. A minute turned into almost thirty. Our waiter had literally disappeared into thin air. Lots of other servers walked past us, not one gave us a second glance. Finally we flagged one down to find ours. He returned, was apologetic, and comped us a round of mimosas, which was much appreciated. He took our order, and off he went. In the end, it took us an hour and fifteen minutes to get our food. One hour and fifteen minutes. When we were the only people in the restaurant. Seriously? WTF.\\n\\nWhen the food finally arrived, it looked great. I had ordered the French toast, and the first few bites were really, really good. But once I was about a third of my way through it, I bit down on something that literally almost made me projectile on my friend across the table. GARLIC. The strongest, most pungent, most putrid  bite of garlic. A flavor that does not pair nicely with cinnamon and syrup. I couldn't figure out what was going on, I literally thought I was being punked. Either something in the kitchen was labeled incorrectly, or someone in the kitchen was just not paying attention. At any rate, I was over it. What was supposed to be a quick meal turned into two painful hours of waiting in a dimly lit, empty restaurant. Needless to say, I will not be returning."},{"name":"Kappo At East End Market","address":"3201 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"5","text":"Let me start by saying that this is not just a restaurant.

O'Sullivan's","address":"151 Central Ave","city":"Lynn","stars":"3.5","text":"I had been eager to try RF O'Sullivans since their opening in Lynn.  I finally had the opportunity Saturday evening, and unfortunately don't plan on going back anytime soon.  Between out of date beer, servers that need better training, and worst of all a hair in the food I'm pretty much all set.  \\n\\nFour of us walked in looking for drinks and appetizers, we were seated in the far corner.  The first thing that I noticed was there was one server for the entire dining area, at that time, there were 8 to 9 parties.  I also noticed the huge TV on the wall was not showing football, but instead a re-run episode of N.C.I.S. with no sound, or closed caption.  Personally, if I'm going to dinner I don't want to see the same TV shows I could watch at home with sound.  \\n\\nOur server was prompt, although for 4 of us only 3 appetizer plates were delivered to the table.  We ordered our drinks and appetizer together, 2 of the 4 drinks were delivered initially with a wait for the other 2.  Ok, maybe the bar is busy, after all there weren't many open seats.  \\n\\nMy friend ordered a bottle of Finestkind IPA, yet was given something else, unfortunately we didn't notice until it was already poured (table side by our server).  Our server was great about getting the taking the bottle and glass and returning with correct bottle, however when it was delivered without a glass.  Ok, is this the result of one server being overwhelmed or just the response from the request to get the correct bottle?  I'm going to assume the former because the server did seem well intentioned.  \\n\\nWhen we asked for a glass and an additional plate for our appetizers, another server brought a plastic soda glass and the extra plate.  Quickly it was realized the soda glass was the wrong glass, and the other server brought the correct beer glass.  Following that we noticed the cross communication between servers which included an educational moment of what a beer glass is versus a mixed drink glass.  The second server was most likely a trainee.  Fair enough, but let them train correctly and don't set them up for failure. \\n\\nOnce everything was settled and we began to enjoy our drinks and food we noticed two things, one, the beer bottle was dated best by: 07/26/15.  Ok, I'm pretty sure Smuttynose didn't intend for their beer to be served post shelf life.  I've sent them a separate message.  The second thing we noticed is that there was a dark hair in the food, a hair which was pulled from the food.  At that point we stopped eating, and left our drinks.  At that point there didn't seem to be value in addressing any additional concerns.  We paid the bill, and left.  For a place that serves burgers at the same price point of the Blue Ox, and doesn't offer free refills on soda I expect better quality, more knowledgeable servers (note, that's just as much a management issue for not training servers better), and cleanliness in the kitchen."},{"name":"Pokeatery","address":"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Ste 1410","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Everything was great and appreciate the use of normal sized shrimp.

We of course had to wait and we were all so grateful to be shown a place to stand and be out of the way while we waited.  We were served drinks and proceeded to get caught up with our friends.  As 8:30 came and went we didn't fret, it's busy on a Friday evening, the apologies came from both our bar server and the hostess, finally we were seated at 9, really no problem.  We were promptly given menus and chose a bottle of wine.  The marble chiller was placed on the table, the amuse bouche was served and then we sat and sat and sat when finally our bar server caught my husbands eye and saw the situation, he got our waitress and she finally came over to bring the bottle we had ordered, opened the wine and took our orders,each of us getting the 3 course prix fixe. \\n\\n The first course came out in a reasonable time, my husband had the sashimi, very good.  I had the Spanish octopus...ehh. And our friends had a beautiful  chick pea soup, delicious.\\n\\nNext our entrees, slow cooked salmon with crab, the best entree by far.  I struck out with the pork 3 ways.  The ribs were salty and though pork belly is always yummy, I've had better.  Our friends had a steak, well cooked yet not really great he didn't enjoy it, the double stuffed chicken was espoused to be just delicious.  Yeah, then we had that little problem again...we were out of wine, and our dirty dishes sat on the table for a very very long time.  My husband was finally able to flag down the waitress and actually had to ask to have them removed.  \\n\\nWe all had our final course and all the desserts were delicious.  Home made sorbets, almond tart all so good.  Again we sat and sat.\\n\\nFinally we got a hold of the waitress and told her we needed to leave soon because I had to work early the next morning.  Got our bill...wow...and we waited and waited for her to come back.  When she came, we again said we had to leave and asked about getting our coats.  She said she'd take the tickets and have them out front for us...needless to say they were not there.  She 'forgot'.\\n\\nI must say that at that point in the night, 12:20AM (yes, 3 hours and 20 minutes later) our bar server was at the front desk, he immediately saw what was going on and got our coats for us.  We didn't complain but the mood was glum and he realized the situation, I would have loved to hear the conversation that ensued after we left.\\n\\nI've never eaten in a restaurant of this caliber and had such poor service.  I don't want that stuffy white glove clang of the cloche, just a friendly comfortable and yes attentive person bringing these delights.  I'm sorry but you should never have to call the wait staff to your table in this type of restaurant, it really ruins the experience and as I read my review I admit that it sours the taste of the food!\\n\\nI really wanted to have a great meal, we were all so looking forward to it but the next time I go out in Boston and spend that kind of money I'll go to 9 Park.

While there was a good amount of food in the bowl, I found everything to be overly heavy. Ate about a quarter and could not finish it. Their version of \\"chicken\\" is quite interesting; I would not say it tastes like chicken, but it's definitely similar. In contrast to the cauliflower, the dish had too much flavour in the sense that there were too many strong flavours that were put together and it became hard to figure out each flavour profile.

Once we were ready to explore the rest of the compound,  we noticed there's a winery ON SITE! ! We walked through the well lit path to a large wooden building filled with wine related must haves and a gigantic selection of wine behind this tall counter.  Awaiting behind it was a sweet wine a aficionado ready to assist.  we decided to do a quick wine tasting of their finest reds. The tasting included 5 wines for $12. Immediately following the 5 th tasting,  our pager started vibrating.  \\n  We walked to the hostess and she whittled us through a building to an indoor patio lined with large picnic tables.

The good news - great Thai cuisine delivered right on time and exactly as ordered.   My seafood special came extra spicy as requested.  Pad Thai was delicious, but a little light on the chicken.  Yellow Curry with Chicken was spot on.  Don't pass up the Satay Chicken appetizer for around 5 bucks.

For drinks, I got the Hyderabad tonic, and my friends got the Kerala, Kumaon cup, Malabar old fashioned, and Patna fizz. The table favorites were the tonic and Kumaon cup, and I thought the fizz was super interesting and different with the lychee flavor and the truffle salt! Only the Kerala was super sweet. The tonic went down very very easy. \\n\\nFor starters, I split the Dahi puri and green pea and goat cheese kulcha, while my friends split the lamb keema hyderabadi. The bun that the keema came with looked so appetizing and so fluffy! The kulcha was very different from traditional Indian flavors with the goat cheese, and I really enjoyed it. I wish the dahi puri had more dahi chutney, and the filling was a bit bland. It would also have been nice to have some sev or boondi on top for added crunch.\\n\\nFor dinner, I got the tandoori mushroom and a chili cheese naan. The mushrooms were everyone's favorite dish: very flavorful, and the polenta upma was a great compliment. We got a free side of dal, which was a very rich, classic dal makhani. My friends got the butter chicken, Achari monk fish, and beef short ribs curry, with three orders of garlic naan. Everyone really liked the butter chicken, which was also pretty classic. The short ribs were a smaller portion than my friend had hoped for, and we sopped up the last drops of the monkfish sauce! The garlic naan was decent, and each order comes with a 2 whole naan cut into halves. \\n\\nFinally, we got the carrot halwa cake for dessert, which comes with honey and saffron sorbet. The sorbet was really good but I didn't love the cake -- the halwa was fine but the cake layers seemed a bit dry/bland. \\n\\nAs for why I gave 3 stars -- there's no question the food is pretty decent. However, this is by far the most I've ever paid for Indian food, and unfortunately I'm not sure if it was worth the price. I see that this is a different spin on Indian food, but overall I felt like the flavors lacked the hearty spice (both the hot and flavorful kinds) I'm used to, and some of the food didn't quite hit the mark. The drinks were probably my favorite part of the meal, and I look forward to coming back to try some other dishes. \\n\\nUPDATE: I went back tonight and got to try a few more dishes! \\n\\nI really fell in love with the paneer chili roll. The crisp vermicelli noodles and the achar spice really kicked it up from a classic paneer kathi roll to something pretty amazing. We also tried the avocado and edamame, in which we were searching a little bit for the avocado. It also seemed a little over-salted for our taste. \\n\\nFor dinner we got the jackfruit kofta, which was a little plain. The kofta was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside, but the flavor was nothing to write home about. I got the cauliflower koliwada, and the curd rice mousse that it comes with was really unique and delicious! I also liked the flavor of the cauliflower but wish it was a little more crispy. \\n\\nI'd say this time I was much more pleasantly surprised by the flavors, which definitely seemed more punchy and bright. However, some aspects of the meal still brought it down a bit, which is why I have opted to keep my review at 3 stars instead of 4."},{"name":"Anchan House of Thai Food","address":"373 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"4.5","text":"Cozy atmosphere.

The website said 2.00 domestic beers but when you get there it's 3.00. It's disorganized and no one knows what is going on.\\n\\nThe best part about the place is the clientele. It went from classy to trashy. This is not the first class Rachels it used to be. The guys are allowed to wear hats backwards or to the side. They come into the club screaming and cursing and just acting like infants and the managers feed into it so they spend money. If you enjoy music, the only day you will get something other than rap is on Thursday. They play old school music. The other days it's majority rap and it's so loud you can't even order a drink with out being rude to the bartender, if you can find one not sitting with a customer. \\n\\nLast week when I was at this Rachels a shaggy looking guy was doing a drug transaction in the parking lot on the side of the building. There was a waiter or someone in a vest looking at it by the back door and did nothing about it. \\n\\nThey do not have the buffet any longer. They have a small menu which never changes. \\n\\nPlenty of alternatives in Central Florida."},{"name":"The Proper Pie Company","address":"145 Ridge Center Dr","city":"Davenport","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped by Saturday morning with my boyfriend. The owner of the shop was behind the counter baking and said hello and told us to let her know if she needed anything. My boyfriend (who was born in the UK) totally geeked out over all the British crisps and pies. The shop was stocked with some things that the \\"English\\" section of Publix doesn't have. \\n\\nWe got a bunch of crisps and candies, plus a few pies and sausage rolls. We devoured the sausage rolls as soon as we got home, as they were fresh out of the oven. The sausages are a home recipe according to the owner of the shop...her husband makes them fresh.

My bf was thrilled at all the goodies we stocked up on, and so far the pies we got are delicious (and freezable!)."},{"name":"Cibo e Beve","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 245","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I wanted to love this place more.\\n\\nReally, I did. My girlfriend and I dined here Saturday evening after making same-day reservations. Since I've heard so much praise and positive reviews of this place, I was VERY excited. We arrived after a couple, and the hostess, without greeting us, seated the couple, came back and answered the ringing phone. In the meantime, the manager approached the host stand to check on something, also did not greet us, and asked some questions of the hostess. Finally, we were asked if we needed a table for two. In response, I told her I made reservations.\\n\\nWe were seated in the middle of the restaurant, at a cramped two-person table extremely close to other tables. I inquired about a booth, and the hostess simply said it was reserved, not making any further effort to accommodate a request to be seated elsewhere. I'm positive the entire restaurant could not have possibly been reserved as she was eager to seat us without reservation, so I'm confident she could have done just a bit more.\\n\\nAnyway, I digress. We were greeted quickly by our server and ordered the following:\\n-Our Signature Cibo Meatballs: san marzano tomatoes, fresh ricotta, parsley\\n-Our Signature Lobster Spaghetti: Maine lobster tail, spicy garlic wine sauce, tomato\\n-Handmade Pappardelle: bolognese sauce\\n\\nThe meatballs are large! They came out hot and steamy and the sauce is delicious. The ricotta is a great addition to the sauce to even out the flavor. However, these were more bread-like than meaty and for $12 for 3, I think they can spare a bit more meat. My plate, the lobster spaghetti, is good -- a thin, light sauce, slightly spicy, and lots of small pieces of lobster. This dish is good, but hardly unique or supreme, and definitely not worth the $30 a pop. The pappardelle was also not what I was expecting - it was completely buried in sauce, and really took away from the fresh pasta. I normally love this dish for its homemade pasta and light sauce, not to be fishing for pasta in a sea of sauce.\\n\\nThe most disappointing part of my dining experience here was the service. Not once did I see any staff member smile - from the hostess to our server to the manager. We were seated directly next to a table who received incredible service from our server while we were practically ignored. I watched in awe as the server checked on the neighboring table 5x before asking us if we were \\"okay\\" in passing. She stopped to chat with them for minutes at a time. I sat with my iced tea empty while she refilled theirs not once, but twice. Only after I asked for a refill did she bring me one, and without simple syrup like I requested the first time.   When the manager checked on us, I asked for more simple syrup and he seemed annoyed at the request. Again, no smile, no warmth.\\n\\nI hate to chalk my experience up to discrimination, but I felt the treatment was blatant. Every patron should be given the same level of service and I'm so disappointed my friend and I were deprived of this. I will not be returning."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Breakfast spot!!

He lifted it off the plate and water poured from the fillet. We showed the waitress who also agreed it looked gross and she brought the manager over to take a look. They ended up giving him a different dish but the worst part of the whole experience was the manager (some woman) told my husband to just eat and shut up twice when his new dish came out, and very loudly.

Both of our favorites was the oaxacan tamale, with chicken in a little of a milder brown mole. Tamales served unwrapped, & the masa is creamy, tasty and not too thick.

I didn't want to come in here next week and see a bunch of other foodsters, and then have to listen to them bragging about this \\"find\\" to their friends, or have to rub elbows with those financial district meat heads, trying to impress each other with their urban savvy. I also didn't want to hear the usual ignorant white-folk banter, about the probable health code violations, lack of chicken finger, and the usual quasi-racist comments about the strange array of unidentifiable organ meats, and, of course, the soup, which is actually a common table soup you'd get at many \\"home style\\" restaurants in China, (which is *not \\"dish water\\", folks, but most likely a very light chicken and seaweed flavored broth, perhaps with a tiny bit of ginger; something I grew to understand, eventually, when living in China).. But, I consider myself a proud champion of any business that offers real food (i.e.,not prefab, frozen & fried protein blobs with starch accompaniment) without trying to build an empire off of its patrons. I had to celebrate this place and what they are doing. While most spots in Chinatown are slowly inflating their rice plate prices, Potluck is exactly the same as it was the last time I came here, 5 years ago. But the food is even better. \\nIf you are interested in authentic, home style Chinese foods, which are markedly different than the lavish imperial creations like Beijing's roast duck or the fine, impeccably fresh seafood of Guandong, you might want to check this place out. As another review noted, you will actually find potatoes being offered, which, unbeknown-st to most Americans, have taken the rural kitchens of China by storm, and exist in thousands of diverse and delicious preparations, such as hot/sour/numbing potato shreds, spicy potato slices, and Yunnan-ese mashed (\\"Grandma's\\") potatoes. Though you'll have to go down the street for better \\"tu dou\\", Potluck offers a simple but satisfying potato dish, and next to that, you'll find sauteed liver, possibly kidneys, hong shao rou (red-cooked pork belly), spicy salted shrimp, deep fried with the head and shell, bai cai (white cabbage) with wood-ear mushrooms, and a host of other meat, fish and vegetable preparations. And since you're practically paying Chinese prices for this, ditch the soft drink and wash the food down with the accompanying soup: a light and slightly salty broth with a hint of chicken and seaweed. Its something many Chinese seem to have on their table, and functions as an almost medicinal component to the meal; hot broth is considered good for the digestive process. Meanwhile, my compatriots often go for sodas or cold water, which are known to disrupt the digestive process (partially due to the fact that your body now has to simultaneously expend energy digesting your food as well as heating up the cold liquids, to maintain stasis. Or something. *Note: I'm guessing many Chinese folks might think we're crazy for guzzling cold booze, soda and ice water with our meals--tea and room temperature water, and even warm beer, were apparently the most common drinks of choice at my neighborhood dives in Chengdu. Those \\"culturally sensitive\\" restaurateurs would know to ask us lao wai's if we wanted cold beer and water with our meals.\\n So pile this up on a hill of rice and you've got dirt cheap, decently prepared (if not the most intricate or intriguing), reasonably healthy comfort food. When's the last time you had that? Now that we have trucks that sling gourmet grilled cheeses for $7. Or that new song and dance where fancy pants chef try to shed their pretentious...pants... and serve gussied diner food, like foie gras meatloaf, and dump truffle oil on the mac n' cheese...Keepin' it real? Can you get real comfort food anymore, at a comforting price.  I noticed, in my recent return to being a Bostonian, that workers' wages haven't actually risen with the rising cost of living, transportation, and everything else that isn't labor. And now comfort food has become another commoditized, nostalgic brand of haute cuisine. Slumming it, getting 'rustic\\" and \\"authentic\\" for fun. Can't wait for the $200 \\"dumpster crawl\\" through Back Bay's finest public allies, where you will dine on \\"extra fermented eclectic fare\\", and get your own bonus rat and dirty wool blanket at the end of the tour, which will end with a nap at a roped-off section of the Commons. But after the next economic meltdown, when the last jobless liberal arts graduate has decided to park their food truck, and the fancy chefs have returned to their day-jobs as caterers for the ruling class, I know that Potluck will still be there. I'll be there, eating the kidneys and guzzling the mystery broth like a good wanna-be putong ren."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Unfortunately I haven to drop my previous review from a five to a four because of the seating fiasco tonight.

Everyone knows Olive Garden food.  It is not top of the line, but it is good enough for a hot weeknight meal.  What brought us in was the \\"buy an entree, get as many as five takeout meals for $5 each\\" promotion.  After 54 years of cooking, I'm getting kind of sick of it and maybe, even moreso, just making the tiresome decision of what to make.  So it's good to have a freezer stocked with ready-made dishes that are tasty and easy to reheat on those days when that cooking boredom hits.  My husband and I each ordered an entree, so we ordered 8 takeout dinners (our freezer wouldn't hold 10!).  You can choose any combination of 4 different meals.  Such a deal!  We had a nice dinner last Tuesday night when the cold kept people in and we were one of only a couple tables.  Surprisingly, perhaps, but the 4 star rating I gave was maybe 10% based on the food, and about 90% on our server, Joey.  He was really an awesome guy.  Because there were so few customer and we were nearing closing time, we had time to actually talk a bit.  I don't know many millenials or x'ers, but people who complain about them never met this guy.  First, he's an excellent server and knows his stuff and specifically Olive Garden menu items and can knowingly recommend dishes and tell you the difference between the different lasagnas.  He's industrious at 20 years old and wise as well.  If people have an open mind, just because they are younger doesn't mean you can't learn from them.  I got a fresh perspective talking to him and I was actually thinking after we left that I still had questions for him (meaning a return visit might be forthcoming soon!).  He just made our evening.  And yes, the food was decent but we will return for the people, specifically, Joey.  I think if there was a negative, it was that I could eat only salad and breadsticks and be blissfully happy.  I'm guessing because we were getting one of the last meals of the night was the reason our breadsticks were both cold and stale.  Not the usual.  Both ends of them were hard.  I know, had I mentioned it to Joey, he would have had a chance to make it right, but we didn't.  The conversation more than made up for it, however.

I'm presenting:\\n\\nExhibit A: The Luther Vandross. Bacon cheeseburger sandwiched between two Krispy Kreme donuts. Of all the food-truck items I've tried in Orlando, this is the one that seems most inspired by Man v. Food, and at the Food Truck Bazaar last weekend, most whom ordered it seemed to be regarding it with a combination of bemusement and, in a few cases, intimidation - and most were ordering it to share with a group. Given the amount of sugar in a lot of commercially produced hamburger buns these days, I'm not sure wrapping a burger in Krispy Kremes is that extreme now. But, it's good fun. \\n\\nExhibit B: Deep-fried, heavily battered Twinkies. I was first introduced to this concept at the Swank Frank in Chicago, which I believe has, sadly, been replaced by a Bank of America (from fat to fatcats?) Treehouse's version is more heavily battered and just as delicious. They are great on their own, but when dipped into some blueberry preserves from the Big Wheel truck, became to-die-for.\\n\\nIn addition to the food, I'd like to give these guys kudos for getting their Food Truck Bazaar process down to a science. Yes, all of the trucks had extensive lines, but this truck managed the process much better than most. There was a dedicated frying stand set up separate from the main line for those just after Twinkies and Oreos, multiple staff took orders from those in line and overall, things moved along much faster than expected."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've become a huge fan of The Salty Pig.\\n\\nThe draft beer list is short, but always has some superstar selections.

My only complaint on the beer list is that they include 1-2 \\"coming soon\\" options, not yet available, which feel like a tease. While I have not ordered wine here, the wine list also appeals to me and seems similarly well-edited.\\n\\nMy favorite item to order is the salty pig parts pizza. I think these are great pizzas--thin, chewy crust and flavorful toppings. I recently had a pappardelle pasta with pork ragu that was also excellent and perfectly cooked. The few times I've had charcuterie it's been fresh and flavorful, and no matter how little you order they do a nice job presenting it to you with accompaniments. The only food item I've ordered that I would not get again are the fried mushrooms, because the taste of the batter overwhelmed any mushroom flavor.\\n\\nThe Salty Pig is often crowded but I've never had trouble finding a seat at the bar.

A symphony of flavors with every bite! This coming from a person who never picks Sushi when someone says, where do you want to meet for dinner. Never. Until eating at Bamboo Sushi on NW 23rd. Then why the 4 stars you are probably asking. I'll get to that. \\n\\nAfter a girls day of shopping on NW 23rd, someone suggested Sushi for dinner.  At every sushi restaurant there is something on the menu for those that don't eat raw fish or care for sushi rolls so I was happy accommodate. \\n\\nWe arrived right as they were opening and were seated immediately. The smell of waffle cones from Salt & Straw next door created a cognitive dissonance between the Asian vibe and scent, but I turned my focus to the decor, the low lighting, large sushi bar area, and the restaurant with lots of tables. The ambiance is very nice. \\n\\nOur drink orders arrived quickly and there was edamame on the house. My friends were deciding on rolls while I quickly picked my dinner of non-Sushi items:\\n\\n- Steamed bun. This night it was stuffed with pork belly. Let me say, for the record, best steamed bun ever! The pork was not minced, but in large chunks and so flavorful. I'd go back just for this item!\\n- Flank steak. The meat was very good, but not outstanding. After being convinced by my friends to try their rolls, I will never order this again. Yep, you heard it, I'm now a convert!\\n- Cauliflower. Very flavorful. \\n\\nNow to what my friends, the pros, ordered, and what I will be getting going forward! With a steamed bun, of course. \\n\\n- Veggies Tempura. Lots of variety. Good, not great. A bit bland. \\n- Cucumber salad. Divine! The texture and the flavors combined for a taste sensation. A great pallete cleanser. \\n- Shishito peppers. Crisp with melted miso butter and bits of pork. Sweet, salty and a little kick. The pe felt bite.\\n- Green Machine roll with crab salad add on. Every bite was a taste of heaven. The long bean was fried so it was crisp. The crab added sweetness. So delicious in every way. Have already gone back and ordered an entire roll for myself!\\n- Garden of Eden. The combo of spicy albacore and sweet, crisp apple, basil and spicy aioli had all of the flavor spectrum covered. Another winner and one I have ordered again. \\n\\nThe entire time I was there I was already planning my next visit! It was that delicious. So one Sunday evening, me and a friend went for dinner at Bamboo Sushi before a movie. We had 6pm reservations but were still seated late. They were extremely busy and according to the waiter, since it was the Sunday following Valentine's Day, there were lots of couples still celebrating. Huh? Ok. That's a first for me!\\n\\nAnyway, the experience we had this night was vastly different from my first. Our edamame and cocktails came out fairly quickly. After some time we received our tempura. After a long time, our waiter came by to ask how our meals were. We said we didn't know since we hadn't received them. Clearly embarrassed, he said he would look into it. \\n\\nHe was overwhelmed by the crowds and he had a new waitress shadowing. I know there was a lot going on but we needed our dinner so we could make our movie, which we told him about the minute we sat down to make sure that he knew we were on a time schedule. He asked if we wanted our dinner to go. No. We wanted it then and there. \\n\\nA short time later my steamed bun arrived. They ran out of pork belly. Huh? It was only 7pm at this point. So they substituted a tempura shrimp. There was nothing good about this choice. It's the filling that makes the bun so the filling needs to have flavor. The shrimp had little flavor and it was just a complete fail. \\n\\nThen our signature sushi rolls came out. They were just as delicious as the first time, which shows consistency.  Problem is we had to eat so fast that I didn't enjoy them and had to leave half behind. Such a waste. I was so disappointed as I had been looking forward to this dinner from the minute I finished my first meal there. \\n\\nFor this reason I had to deduct a star. I like the food too much to not go back, but will never go before a movie or another commitment. \\n\\nI finally get why people love and crave Sushi.

The burger was a mouthful, and was perfectly cooked. It tasted wonderful. The truffle fries were more like potato wedges-- I'm certain we were each served a full potato. I am not a big fan of truffle oil, but a little salt and ketchup made everything better.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the bread pudding, which was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. \\n\\nThe cost of our meal was excellent for all that we enjoyed. We were pleasantly surprised when we received our bill.\\n\\nAll in all, S+Y is a great place for a nice dinner.

To have a new clean restaurant and allow this to ruin its reputation at the start. Went in tonight and there was no line in the drive thru and no one inside. Ordered a kids meal and a Double Western large. Took a while and I thought we were waiting for fresh fries. I did not see anyone dump fresh fries. The dude that took our order just stood there with the bags containing our burgers just sitting on the counter waiting for the other person to fill the fries. That person turns out was sweeping prior to filling the two fry orders. Did not wash her hands and as I noticed did not even set the broom aside. She did dig some of the fries out, with her bare fingers, from under something in the fry filling area. She never washed her hands and never let go of the broom and the person that was just standing watching her. So was the person at the burger assembly line. So this tells me that this is acceptable food safety and hygiene at this location. I could see calling them out on this was pointless since they all seemed to think it was okay to hold and handle a dirty broom while handling food that is going to be served.

So to make good I ventured to Thai Bistro for lunch one dark, rainy day for some uplifting Pad Thai.\\n\\nYou enter the place into a small foray and then down a hallway to get to the restaurant where you are greeted by rows of chairs all wearing what looked like Colonial era bedclothes.  There was a Christmas tree by the kitchen entrance and, well, it kind of looked like Father Christmas threw up all over the restaurant.  Strange since 95% of Thai people are Buddist, but if you know anything about Buddists they love a good time and a good celebration so i guess it was not totally out of context here.  I sat down while a younger, more sane, Michael Jackson and his Brothers sang Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  Puts one in a real Thai mood.\\n\\nI ordered Lunch Special 24, Pad Thai, no onion and prepared mild.  Why?  Because I dislike onions and I am a wimp.  Also I asked for a Diet Cola.  To my surprise, maybe I did not read the fine print, a salad arrived at my table with my drink.  It was a nice iceberg salad with a Thai Peanut dressing, very nice on a dark and rainy day.  Before I got the salad finished a huge pile of Pad Thai came to my table and copped a squat in front of me.  I think I actually mumbled, \\"My lord...\\" when I saw the size of it.\\n\\nNow a huge portion of food can be a problem.  Sometimes how do restaurants make bad food better?  By giving you an endless supply of it.  It is the mantra of many buffet's and Sunday Brunch places.  So I was on alert.  However, whatever the taste was going to be, it looked like a work of art.\\n\\nBefore I get to the food I want to comment on the plates.   Plates?  You say?  Yes.  So, like many restaurants, Thai Bistro uses a glass top of the table over a tablecloth, which is great I can see why they do that.  The food came on a beautiful concave glass plate, almost bowl like.  As I was eating, if I did not keep my hand on my plate, as I used my fork to eat (I am not handy with chopsticks except with sushi) the plate would spin.  It was quite comical, really.  I am totally not complaining about it either, I found it amusing and endearing.  The curvy glass for my diet soda was elegant but did not really hold a lot of liquid.  Thank goodness they refill here.\\n\\nThe Pad Thai was very good.  I was expecting a tad more heat, but I did say mild and I guess their mild is... well.... milder than most.  Still the flavor was fantastic with big chunks of chicken throughout.  A crispy crab puff came with it as did some cabbage and carrot.  Nice touch.  The service was excellent as well, very attentive but not overbearing and always a smile.\\n\\nIf you like Thai food and for some godforsaken reason you find yourself in Tualatin you could do a lot worse than Thai Bistro. This place does it as well as any I have tried so far."},{"name":"Crazy Burrito","address":"4081 Trueman Blvd","city":"Hilliard","stars":"3.5","text":"Crazy burrito is huge and will fill you up.

I'm not sure who \\"they\\" are or when \\"they\\" allegedly said this thing, but I can vouch that there may be some truth to this notion. \\n\\nOn a mission to research how soon I will suffer a coronary from clogged arteries I decided to stop by this new-to-Good-Food-Here cart for a healthy dose of Vitamin** FC. The menu is fairly short and to the point - chicken, chicken sandwiches, wings, fries and slaw. The options today consisted of the Blazer, the Jalapy (my choice) and a pulled chicken sandwich. \\n\\nThe Jalapy is a spicy little number with a hurkin' huge piece of fried chicken seasoned with a mildly spicy sauce, bacon, cheese and jalape√±os on a brioche bun. Ordered with a side of fries it's a $10 meal that's chock full of probably a full day's worth of calories. As you can see from my photos, it looks delicious and tastes the same. Hearty boneless white breast deep fried to crispy deliciousness with a nice seasoning and mild heat - exactly as advertised. The fresh jalape√±os add some heat but I think on my next occasion I'd take it up a notch to \\"hot\\" chicken, which I know from sampling my dining partner's chicken fingers is pretty damn hot. They offer it in XXX as well - but I'll save eating that for when I have a crowd that really needs to see me pulling off a macho stunt. \\n\\nThese folks do pretty much one thing and do it really well. While we both agreed that the batter doesn't quite adhere to the chicken as much as we'd like, the flavor and perfect crispiness make up for it. You're paying on the higher end of what you'd expect from a cart but they use quality ingredients (not bargain basement chicken) and I'll pay a couple bucks extra for that any day. \\n\\nThe pair that runs this cart is from N. Carolina - or North Cackalack, as the locals supposedly call it and bring with them a passion for good food and friendly service. Within a few minutes of chatting with them I learned a lot about what they're up to, what they're aiming for, and why I should love their product so much. And I do. Not to say that I won't be enjoying other fried chicken in town. I still like to play the field. But their addition to GFH pretty much cements this pod as the best in PDX. \\n\\nGet thee to Cackalacks. Try the chicken. Tell them Don sent you. Enjoy.

The steak was good, but the sauce was just ok.

The blueberry lemonade was a good mix of the 2 flavors, not overtly more of either just light & refreshing on a hot day.  The bread pudding was outstanding! The sauce was really sweet though so rather than pour it over--like I think we were supposed to--we dipped small pieces into it individually.  \\n\\nSide note: I was going to try the bangers & mash, but server wasn't sure on what to compare them to taste-wise & I'm really picky about sausages.

They have \\"cut out the middle man\\" this way, without making any sacrifices in service and quality.\\n\\nIf you choose to sit at Kappo's bar which squeezes in roughly 8, be prepared to wait at least 30 min.  Or you can opt to sit at one of the other stalls (like skyebird & lineage) if they're closed.  Ordering basically means choosing a combination of sushi (w/rice), sashimi (no rice), maki (hand roll) or temaki (although it's usually cone shaped, theirs is more like a burrito).  The ingredients used in the pieces will be up to the chef, but I assure you it will be amazing!  Keeping true to the market nature, they also offer premade rolls, onigiri and icecream to go and the flavors/fillings change daily.\\n\\nThe first course we had was 3 pieces of sushi and 3 pieces of sashimi.  The second was 8 pieces of sushi served one at a time, so each was different, followed by temaki.  Highlights for me included lion fish, salmon belly topped with a ginger, pine nut and bacon paste and scallop topped with truffle salt.  We were then treated to a sorbet made from chu hai (I'm 99% sure anyway, I learned a lot of new words tonight haha).  But wait, there's more!! They surprised us with a plate of local fruits which included star fruit, peaches, pears and blackberry topped with a soy milk creme anglaise.  I had to stop myself from licking the plate!\\n\\nBesides wanting to continue stuffing my face, I also had a hard time leaving because hanging with the staff was such a blast!!

I'm guessing the rice cost approximately 10 cents and the container not much more, so you know the markup is huge.  \\n\\nAs for my dish, Rod Dee did it much better.  Too many vegetables, some strange sauce and the expensive rice.  The portion size was good, but that's the only positive thing I can say.  It all made for a truly average AND expensive experience.

Albeit, they are very busy so it can be slightly hard to flag them for refills or asking for more beverages. Just be ready to order more refills when they come back to check on you.\\n \\nFood-wise, we ordered chicken and waffles, P-boy's biscuit, and shared a peach French toast for the table. The food comes out looking very appealing and the taste isn't bad too boot. To begin, the chicken and waffles comes out like two sandwiches, but fork and knife would be my suggestion still. The waffles are crisp, subtly sweet, and do not taste dry at all. The chicken was the best part in my opinion, because the buttermilk batter doesn't just contain salt, but it has a herb in it to elevate the taste. I'm not positive which herb it is, but it was pleasant to the taste buds and smelled very aromatic. The P-boy's biscuit is essentially their crispy fried chicken in a biscuit, but added on 1) chicken fried steak gravy, 2) egg omelet with cheese, and 3) bacon. It's a secret menu item (as they say) and clearly a heart attack to happen. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it a lot and was happy to splurge on it (price point and for my health). The gravy is nice as it fits the biscuit and chicken theme and it's not a heavy sausage gravy. Not the strongest tasting gravy, but I think that works out since it's complementing chicken and not a sausage patty. The egg omelet isn't anything to write home about, but it adds texture to the order. The bacon add-on was nice and four slices were added into the order. The bacon was crispy, but on the salty side of things. The biscuits were unfortunately on the dry side and not fluffy as I would have imagined a biscuit to be. Lastly, the chicken was nice, but the chicken and waffles' chicken was better in my opinion. As a whole, P-boy's biscuit was nice to have, but I wouldn't consider having it again purely because I consider it a one-time try than repeatedly trying it.\\n \\nLastly, for the peach French toast, canned peaches were used and the French toast was about average to what I expected. Instead of powdered sugar, they do use brown sugar on top - truly southern. As a whole, not a bad item, but nothing as spectacular as their chicken items.\\n \\nNot bad and I suggest giving them a try especially if you plan to go to the nearby attractions.

I'm no restaurant reviewer, so please excuse my limited adjectives.\\n\\nFirst course: amuse bouche\\n- The crab was really fresh, and it was surprising to taste crab this good in the NE. (I'm from Maryland. Blue crabs are the best!)\\n- The teeny slivers of pork belly with fresh mozzarella was delicious. The little splash of balsamic vinegar was a nice touch.\\n\\nSecond course: appetizer\\n- His mushroom ragout was out of this world. We were intrigued by this gelatinous form in the middle of his plate, and we discovered it was a poached egg! Yum! This dish was creamy, rich and delicious.\\n- My sashimi was perfection. There were so many different textures and unexpected that went really well together! Our appetizers were definitely the highlight of our meal.\\n\\nThird course: entree\\n- His scallops were good, but not great. There isn't much you can do to scallops. They're either good or bad.\\n- My lamb three ways was really delicious. My favorite among the loin, lamb heart sausage and lamb confit was the confit.\\n\\nFourth course: dessert\\n- His mixed fruit dessert was amazing. It sounded pretty plain on the menu, but this is a very special dessert. The canela ice cream really topped it off - such a unique flavor! \\n- My gingerbread pain perdu was soooo gingery. Beware - this dessert is for ginger LOVERS only. The poached cranberries were too tart to eat, even with the other elements of the dessert. \\n- A complimentary dessert wine was included in our prix-fixe, and ohhhh, I love dessert wines!!! \\n- A Taza hot chocolate with cardamom and other spices was also complimentary, and I've decided that I don't really like cardamom. But it was free, so we slurped it up!\\n\\nSo, the best part about our meal was definitely the appetizers, but I also have to mention the service. Our server was awesome. He really made us feel welcome--even appreciated! He was friendly, pleasant, calm, professional, efficient, and available. \\n\\nI have to conclude this review by making a little comparison. Our other mind-blowing Valentine's Day dinner was at Ten Tables JP last year... and I have to say that I prefer TT over Craigie. Every single course and element of our Ten Tables dinner was completely unforgettable. Nothing about it was so-so or just good. But I'm still giving Craigie on Main five stars because I do think it was pretty much as good as it gets.\\n\\nOh! One tip about attire. Yelpers have categorized the attire as \\"dressy,\\" but be aware that the servers themselves wear dark jeans. I'd say it's more on the casual side. No ties or jackets necessary.  \\n\\nTHE END!"},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"After shopping Downtown Disney, we were ready for dinner.

After searching for an hour or two for the best splurge, we decided on the 7 course tasting menu from Craigie on Main. \\n\\nThe amuse-bouches were a piece of smoked salmon on a cucumber and prosciutto on a cracker. My mouth honestly wasn't that amused. \\n\\nThe bread didn't seem freshly baked and was cold. The coldness was really off-putting, so I was already not really feeling the dinner. \\n\\nDrinks - 5/5: I got a south of the border and he got a rabarbaro coast, both of which were incredible drinks. We were both very happy with them. \\n\\nCourse 1 - 5/5: sea bass ceviche. This was actually the most incredible thing. I could have eaten this all night... The flavor was really incredible and the fish seemed super fresh. \\n\\nCourse 2 - 6/5: I honestly didn't know the food could get better, but the octopus they served after was also one of the most incredible things I'd ever eaten. They'd done something to the octopus to make the texture unlike any mollusk I'd ever eaten before. The broccoli was also the best broccoli I'd eaten in my life as well. \\n\\nCourse 3 - 4/5: Delicious fried clams. They were great, but not significantly different from good fried clams I'd eaten before. \\n\\nCourse 4 - 2/5: the squid ink pasta was really weird. It didn't taste good at all. I got a random piece of red meat in my portion, which I'm pretty sure wasn't supposed to be there. I got 4 shells and 3 clams. My fianc√© got 2 shells and 0 clams. The bread crumbs on the top were just strange. Definitely the worst course. \\n\\nCourse 5 - 4/5: I could tell that this tongue was executed incredibly well. It was crispy and tender in all the right ways, and the garnishes that came with it were well matched. For some reason, it just tasted a little bit off to me. Maybe I'm not experienced in eating tongue, so I'm not sure what to make of my experience. \\n\\nCourse 6 - 4/5: Lamb two ways. Honestly, same thing as with course 5. The meat was amazing in many ways, but there was just something slightly off about the flavor, and the beans and tomato that came with it was just not to my taste. I didn't feel like there was any flavor in this dish. \\n\\nDessert 1 - 4/5: The goat's milk tapioca pudding was once again, just really not to my taste. I'm not sure what it was about it that was off-putting, but it didn't really seem that good. I could tell it was nice though. \\n\\nDessert 2.1 - 4/5 deconstructed blueberry pie. It was a little sweet, but quite good. \\n\\nDessert 2.2 - 5/5 expresso mousse with nuts and cherries. This dessert was really delicious. A little sweet for my taste, but delicious\\n\\nIt should be noted that with the exception of the clams and the squid ink pasta, my fianc√© was in heaven, so the menu possibly just didn't suit my tastes. \\n\\nOverall, I miggghhhttt go again.

Combining brainy books and brunch? It's an alliteration fantasy! And a fabulous concept. I came here for the food primarily, though, and that part of my experience here was only just okay. And the service was sub-par. That said, this is a different fun/different for foodie-bookworms like me. I enjoyed my time here despite some significant shortcomings. I can see why it has so many reviews--great location in the College Mecca. Three stars aside, I'd still recommend this to most.\\n\\nCame here as a part of five for Sunday brunch at around 11:30. Right when you walk in, you're greeted by a wall full of top-rated books on your left. Fiction, non-fiction--you name it. A more personal, more curated version of Barnes & Noble. The quarters are a bit tight, so make sure to be mindful of where your limbs are ending up. If you're coming here to eat, there will be someone to help you as you walk in. Important note: there are NO reservations on weekends. So if you're in a time crunch, budget in a bit of extra time for waiting. We happened to get a table almost immediately, but my parents said they usually wait around 30 minutes for a table. Plan accordingly. The good news about all of this? If you do need to wait, you've got an entire bookstore at your disposal with a fantastic selection.\\n\\nThe menu here is pretty expansive for a hybrid venue. Though Trident is as casual as it gets, they have more than just your average diner offerings. Some fun takes on breakfast staples and a number of solid vegan options. I tend to eat vegan a lot of the time so I'm always on the look out. One note: on weekends--before 5pm--they only offer their brunch/breakfast menu. So if any of those savory bowls catch your eye for brunch, you're out of luck. \\n\\nWe got a nice variety of food here. I ended up ordering an egg white omelette with a bunch of veggies (spinach, mushrooms, broccoli, onions and avocado). Pretty good, but nothing too exciting. It was under-seasoned and too greasy so the plate required much napkins, salt and pepper. Everyone else enjoyed their dishes pretty well, except for my dad. He gave specific instructions to the waitress to make his dish (the breakfast skillet) extra hot. Eggs should always be hot, anyway. Unfortunately, his dish arrived lukewarm at best. In traditional fashion, he went on his complaining soapbox. Eventually he sent it back. He did receive a much-hotter version not long after, but the asiago cheese was kind of sadly resting atop the eggs as opposed to gooey and melty as it should be. When I have asiago cheese served with my eggs, I don't want it sprinkled on top like romano cheese. So that was great. Thankfully, no other food problems came up after this wee snafu.\\n\\nService was below-average at best. It took forever to get coffee and water refills--our waitress was impossible to track down. And obviously that whole not-putting-in-special-instructions thing happened. It seemed like they might've been understaffed.\\n\\nThankfully, Trident redeems itself with its fantastic array of books. I'm very into spirituality/Buddhism, and there's a massive section here reserved for just this genre. I also picked up a few new fiction books I've been meaning to read, so it was definitely a kill-two-birds-with-one-stone trip. If you're in the market for a special occasion card, Trident has you covered, too. Lots of funny stuff, lots of animal cards, lots of feminism, lots of humor.

Even if you are there early, not all food will be ready. \\n\\nOne thing I did not get was the ordering of lumpia. In the price list, it said \\"Fried lumpia (3 for combo) $1.50\\". I asked about it. First, the staff said it was not ready, that they only fry on the spot otherwise it would not be crispy. Then she said it need to be pre-ordered. So did that mean I need to call in advance to order just 3 pieces? It did not make sense to me.\\n\\nThe general feel I got from my visits here were discrepancies in the prices listed and what they charged, the staff was fairly impatient when being asked questions, the staff was not really keen to explain the what the dishes were.\\n\\nMaybe it would be easier to order if you can speak the language or bring someone along who can speak it, or if you stick to the basic of the combos on the board and not deviate from that and try to order those side sides.\\n\\nPretty disappointing.

I went in expecting to pay a premium for a hype product, but there was also an expectation that the product would live up to the social media hype. Unfortunately, what I was served did not look like the pictures Instagram food bloggers were posting. I know some reviews show better looking pancakes, so perhaps the kitchen just had an off day during my visit.

The cheese to breading ratio was far off, although I am a fan of goat cheese so I still ate them(plus I'm a fatty at heart). The short rib sandwich, pretty good, got spicier as I ate it, and I actually ended up eating it with a fork and leaving the bun behind. My boyfriend had the palm sugar steak and it was bland overall, however the veggies it came with were deliciously roasted to perfection. The dessert was the brownie sundae, and I wasn't a fan. The brownie was very rich but not sweet, almost like a bittersweet chocolate brownie, that came with a small scoop of ice cream and a cream sauce. I was impressed with the massive beer menu. They have anything you could desire. The bill came to $80 for two beers, two appetizers, two entrees and a dessert, which isn't crazy but is still on the medium expensive side.

Oh, we needed you King Bao. And, right where you are, too. You walk into a simple, spacious, very feng shui-ish(?) wide open space with a big menu to the right loaded with 8 or 9 well-thought out bao choices. Every portion, condiment, topping, and seasoning is done well - you can't choose wrong. If you want to go full-king on them and treat yourself, go with: 3 Bao combo (Kickin Chicken, Glenn Rhee/Hogzilla, & Veganville); Porky's Tatchos (if you don't want to pork overload, go truffle) as a side, and the Tarzan for dessert. All this splurge plus a can soda, just $15. Insert happy dance here. \\n\\nJust keep in mind that, despite the interesting flavors, it is basically a fast food restaurant, which should help you lower your expectations. I can definitely appreciate that once I drove there, ordered food to-go, waited for it to be made, and then drove home all in just 12 minutes.  This is a: \\"order your food, eat it quick, and get out\\" place - even if the college kids choose to hang out in here for an hour. I have been a few times in their first month, and my first visit was by far the best - and I think the owner (or someone who looked like they were running the joint) made the food. My visits after that, I didn't see him - and it showed in the food. Their biggest challenge will be maintaining consistency (shrimp has been fried sometimes, and not others; chicken has been a tender sometimes, a patty others; tots and baos both have had an item missing; cashier didn't know menu). I'm hopeful that they are still tweaking their menu, sourcing, and the volume to expect - and eventually they will get in a groove.\\n\\nOn to the bao....the Hogzilla combination of their braised pork belly, carrots, and peanuts is a great choice for every visit, as is the Gleen Rhee combo of short ribs and pear salsa (I dare you to try to eat this one slowly). The OMG Grouper is kinda one note, and probably my least favorite. King Bao also offers two very interesting vegetarian options, that even non-vegetarians will appreciate. My favorite of the 2 is Veganville for a mouthful of crisp tofu with this killer spicy pepper relish. Kickin Chicken is probably the most filling. The tots are good - but the two more boring sounding of the 2 are indeed that, so branch out with the pork Tatchos nachos or the Fakenit tots, with tofu and bacon - with the real star as the garlic and onion jam. Kings don't skip dessert, by the way. So, just give them your $2 without even thinking. (Fried bao, banana, nutella...if you needed any push!) Delicious, quick, spotless, cheerful - these guys nailed it, and I hope they maintain a great staff that can duplicate it over and over.

I read a number of good reviews for the Jimmy Hula's on University but I guess those people had a different experience than I did. My girlfriend ordered a margarita and it was made with a styrofoam cup instead of a shaker. The mix was very sweet and made for a sub par margarita that actually upset her stomach. I noticed that I was pretty much sweating while sitting at my seat and asked the server if it was always this hot in here? She said the air conditioner goes in and out. I am not an overweight or out of shape person, so sweating while I sit inside a restaurant is pretty ridiculous. I ordered two tacos both of which had steak. One of them was absolutely excellent while the other had steak that couldn't be chewed. Apparently another issue with the building is that the roof leaks when it rains. Since this restaurant is in Florida that happens almost every day. I can't imagine what kind of things from the roof end up in the food if it leaks every time it rains. I also don't want to know how hot it gets in the kitchen because that means the people working in the kitchen are very hot and are undoubtedly sweating over everyones food.

Both rolls were delicious, but the shrimp termpura roll was a revelation. I will never NOT order this roll.\\n\\nI was so impressed and will most definitely be eating here regularly going forward. Their vegan menu is extensive and I see myself eventually eating my entire way through it. \\n\\nMy partner got regular sushi and he was also very impressed. There is literally something for everyone here.

Also the rave reviews, interesting menu, and exceptional service. \\n\\nFrom the first step inside--- it took a turn for the worse.\\n\\nI called Wednesday and made a reservation for two with notes of a birthday celebration and requests to sit in the side room by a window-- if available. \\n\\nIf that wasn't open it wouldn't have been an issue whatsoever but not only did they not have our reservation (which I made myself) but the hostess handled it horribly. \\n\\nI gave our name and reservation time and she came up with nothing.  \\"Your name is not even in our SYSTEM\\" basically saying I never even called. She even went so far to ask \\"Are you sure you're in the right place?\\" \\nI may not be anything special but I'm pretty damn sure I didn't mistake SoHo for another restaurant. \\n\\nI was immediately embarrassed and assumed I had the name under my own (even after distinctly recalling spelling my fianc√©s last name for the gentleman who answered the phone Wednesday) and she still couldn't find any type of reservation. \\n\\nShe then proceeded to say 'we can still find a table for you walking in without a reservation' ---I MADE ONE! It was so extremely rude. \\n\\nI was so upset I didn't even bother to mention I had a specific request for a table or that it was my birthday. \\nIt's kind of awkward to tell someone it's your birthday celebration and they totally dropped the ball when they are acting like they are doing you a favor by 'finding' a seat for you. \\n\\nAlso, we know that we were seated at table 21 because she couldn't seem to be professional enough to not talk in industry lingo in front of guests. \\nObviously she was unaware that I am in the same industry and consider her behavior and reaction to the issue unprofessional. \\n\\nWe were seated at a small two top basically next to the bar smashed shoulder to shoulder with two other couples. We could hear everyone's conversation but our own. \\n\\nThe manager never came by but to check on our food after we ate it. I didn't have the heart to launch into a full-on complaint about the woman who 'greeted us' or our seating. \\n\\nWe started with a cheese plate and a bottle of Oberon. \\nExcellent all around. \\nThe server was informative and pleasant. We were not upset with his service whatsoever, he was attentive and professional without being pretentious or overbearing. \\n\\nOur entrees were elk tenderloin (yum) and sea bass with bok choy and purple rice (also yum). \\nBut honestly besides a good meal the overall experience was completely ruined by the fact that we felt unwelcome and out of place. \\n\\nWhy wouldn't I just tell the server it was my birthday? \\nBecause I don't like doing so. \\n\\nI specifically made a reservation and told them I was celebrating my birthday with my fianc√© so I wouldn't have to do the awkward 'tell the server we are having a special dinner' thing. \\n\\nI hate to be this person but it literally made the whole evening a bit dampened. Very disappointing considering the food was so good. \\n\\nYou never know how an initial experience can affect the whole evening. \\n\\nBut it really truly did.\\n\\nI mentioned to the same hostess on our way out (after checking my call log - just incase to be sure I wasn't crazy) that I did call, I did make a reservation and I did have a special request.

When I found out about the burger at Craigie, I knew I had to try it. As a quick primer for anyone who is not aware, Craigie serves 18 of their off-the-menu burgers every night. The 8 oz grass-fed patty is made of three different cuts of beef with bone marrow and suet, seasoned with dehydrated miso, and served on a homemade bun with mace ketchup, lettuce and onions cooked in the beef juices, and a slice of yellow tomato.\\n\\nOur group of three got to Craigie at 5PM thanks to my persistent nagging and we were successfully the first ones in line. While waiting for the doors to open, I did some reading on the burger to kill time and by the time we were let in at 5:30PM, I felt slightly bad for coming just for the burger (Eater article that I read, for reference: http://boston.eater.com/2015/4/17/8442815/the-reluctant-burger-titans-of-boston#4702168)\\n\\nRegardless of my slight guilt, our group of three was graciously let in and I made what, at the time, seemed like a grave mistake of telling the hostess that we wanted to sit in the bar area (instead of just sitting at the bar). I then proceeded to freak out as the 11 other people (yes I counted) who were lined up behind me filled all the bar seats as we stood to the side waiting for our table to be set up. There was no way I just waited 30 minutes to not get a burger--nuh uh. I would've moved heaven and earth for the burger at that point.\\n\\nWe got seated shortly after my mini panic attack and our waiter was swift to take our order. We said we were interested in the burger and he told us he'd put in a hold order for us, but strongly urged us to look at the actual menu. We did, but didn't end up getting anything else (this coupled with that Eater article caused me to feel even more guilt).\\n\\nI ordered a Hotel Street Punch, which came out quickly and was very strong and very delicious. The service at Craigie is absolutely amazing. Our water glasses were never more than half empty before someone came over to refill our glasses (mind you, the bottle of still water was on our table and we would've happily refilled the glasses ourselves). The attentiveness of the wait staff is beyond anything I expected.\\n\\nWe didn't need to wait long for our burgers, and despite being seated after everyone at the bar, we got our food first (perks of being seated, perhaps?). So on to the burger!\\n\\nThe burger, in complete honesty, lived up to all the hype. The ingredients tasted so fresh--the salad served on the side was delicious and I don't even like salad. The patty was perfectly seasoned, incredibly juicy, and cooked to a nice medium rare. This was literally the most flavorful burger patty I've experienced. The mace ketchup added a nice kick as well, and I'm a sucker for yellow tomatoes so that sold me completely. I do have to admit that the burger is so dense with flavor that I had trouble finishing the last bite or so. I was very grateful for both the side salad and the amazing home fries that came with, as they balanced out the burger when the flavor felt overwhelming.\\n\\nBy 6PM, the burgers were sold out, so definitely get here early if you're looking to try the burger. You must sit at the bar or at the bar side of the restaurant to order the burger. At $18 per burger, this was definitely the most I've ever paid for a burger, but the first time experience was well worth both the price and the wait. I don't think I would come back frequently due to both these points and how heavy the flavor was. If you have a palate for heavier flavors though, this burger would be perfect.\\n\\nNow go forth, young padawan, and experience the burger at Craigie on Main for yourself!"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pambiche has some very yummy food ...\\nEveryone is very friendly and ready to answer your question give you suggestions..\\nGo eat there"},{"name":"Rooh Columbus","address":"685 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"This is what I imagine people would call gourmet Indian food.

The deli opened in 1996 and is located on a small stretch of Broad St that contains several restaurants including Ali Baba's (Mediterranean), NaanStop (Indian), Rosa's Pizza, and Dua (Vietnamese). This place is known for its overstuffed sandwiches (especially the Reuben); grilled foods such as Philly cheesesteaks and hot dogs; and soups, salads, meats, and cheeses.\\n\\nThis is a traditional deli where you stand in line, order, and pay upfront. There are two separate counters: one to order coffee and restaurant-described \\"frou-frou\\" drinks (e.g. mocha, latte, hot chocolate) and one to order sandwiches and other food. Bottled beverages, fountain drinks (Coke products), tea, cheap disposable plastic cutlery, napkins, etc. are self-serve.\\n\\nThe place has table seating inside for 32 customers: 20 in the back and 12 in the front near the big storefront windows. The storefront sits in front of a concrete and brick sidewalk that contains additional seating outside. The wide sidewalks make this block pedestrian-friendly. The interior is decorated with black and white framed photos of city buildings and old baseball players plus Georgia State paraphernalia and cartoon caricatures. I wonder what the story is behind the latter.\\n\\nFree parking is rare or non-existent in this part of town. Your best bet is to street park, either directly in front of the restaurant or nearby, or park in one of the parking decks downtown. Either way, you'll have to pay to park. The street spots are metered and enforced by PARKatlanta.\\n\\nReuben's Deli offers over a dozen different kinds of 1/3-pound \\"signature\\" sandwiches. Most of these run about $7-9 each. Examples include the Classic (roast beef, corned beef, turkey, slaw, thousand island), Eastsider (hot corned beef, hot pastrami, slaw, thousand island), tuna and chicken salad melts, and New Yorker (hot corned beef, hot pastrami, Swiss cheese). You can also customize your own sandwich from a bevy of bread, meat, cheese, topping, and dressing/sauce options. Deli meat examples include ham, capicola, salami, bologna, pepperoni, and liverwurst.\\n\\nThe deli utilizes Boar's Head and Thumann's meats. I believe they may use the latter for their hot dogs of which they have a few varieties: Atlanta made with chili, slaw, and cheese; Chicago made with mustard, pickles, tomatoes, and peppers; and New York made with deli mustard and sauerkraut. Dogs are roughly $4-5 each.\\n\\nBreakfast is also served and includes items such as omelets, scrambled eggs, biscuits, pancakes, and bagels with spreads and toppings like schmear and lox (brined salmon fillets). The bagels are H&H brand bagels from New York.\\n\\nOn their menu, Reuben's Deli proudly describes their Reuben as being \\"#1 rated by Yelp\\" (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/reubens-deli-atlanta?select=fQrA2GG9y76ezVwe3sXQCw). I can see why. It's absolutely delicious and ranks up there with the Reuben sandwich at Capozzi's New York Deli in East Cobb (http://www.yelp.com/biz/capozzis-new-york-deli-marietta) as one of the best Reubens I've enjoyed in metro Atlanta. In general, the sandwiches here are packed to the brim and often overflow with ingredients creating a messy, but delicious sammie eating experience. The traditional Reuben comes with quality corned beef served with kraut and Swiss cheese. You can also get turkey and pastrami variations. The grilled rye bread is appetizing and the sandwich is delectably meaty. Overall, this is simply a filling, satisfying sandwich that I have no reservations in recommending.\\n\\nAnother sandwich I've tried is the Jack Stack. Holy crap is it huge. It comes with jerk and blackened turkey, pork sausage, bacon, provolone, pepper jack, and spicy mayo. It's a struggle just to take a bite out of this sandwich due to its sheer size. Photo: https://instagram.com/p/6amDCtwBpI/. It's a piled high monstrosity of turkey goodness. They do not skimp on the meat.\\n\\nAnother food you can get at Reuben's Deli is Knish. Knish is a popular food in New York with Eastern European and Jewish roots. You can sort of think of it as a large potato dumpling. Reuben's serves their knish New York style with strong spicy mustard. The knish is about the size of a couple slices of bread. It's dense and mainly made out of mashed potatoes. The exterior is slightly crispy, similar to a fried or baked breading. The inside has a smooth consistency reminiscent of some samosas. If you've never tried knish before, I suggest ordering it.\\n\\nThe fresh-baked cookies (e.g. chocolate chip, 3 for ~$2) and coffee drinks ($3-4 per) are pretty good as well. The Caffe Nocciola (espresso, hazelnut, cocoa, steamed milk, foam) may be frou-frou, but it's sweet and tasty.\\n\\nService is good. The staff is friendly and everything is made to order. If ordering knish, you'll want to give the kitchen an additional 5-10 minutes."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We came to this restaurant with family who claimed  it to be one of their very favorite in Boston.

Appetizer was simple yet well presented on the plate as we chose the antipasto traditionale. Also my lasagna Verdi ala Bolognese was made instantly, served in a teracota dish, and if you had paste ala Bolognese before you'll  know that this is a genuine Bolognese dish. We closed the night in a classic Italian style with delicious home made tiramisu and a glass of limoncello.

First off, this place is packed on Saturdays.  I made a reservation a week in advance, but even that didn't save me from having to wait an hour.  It was frustrating, but all was forgiven once we sat down and the fun began.\\n\\nWe got a booth in the Grandstand area, so we had a great view of the stage where the performers are.  Our performance was The Rythms of Raglan Dance Show.  Some of the best tap dancers I've ever seen.  They were all actually from Ireland too, so it felt authentic.  Props to the dancers for really giving it their all.  Many of the routines, they had the entire restaurant clapping along.  It was great.  I especially liked when they brought the kids up on stage to dance with them.  It was really cute. \\n\\nWhen it came to food, I thought this place was pretty creative.  They had this great cheese board to share, and it was quite unique.  Some really earthy cheeses.  Went great with the pork and the cured beef.  That apricot chutney was full of flavor, and unlike anything I've ever had. \\n\\nI had no choice, I had to order the Irish egg.  Im Irish after all.  It too, was unique and unlike anything I've ever had.  To me, that's what makes a restaurant worth coming to, finding menu items you couldn't otherwise get anywhere else.  It felt like a deep-fried egg ball, but it was pretty tasty.  Didn't care for the picked veggies though.  A bit too overpowering.  \\n\\nThe Brussel Sprouts were good.  The Nom Nom Wings were great.  The Boaring Burger was outstanding.  That pear chutney with the herb aioli that coated the inside of the buns was incredible.  Honestly, some of the best sauce on a burger I've ever had.  Worked great with the blue cheese.  \\n\\nDesserts weren't bad either.  The Fluffy Lemon Clouds tart was good but the crust was quite thick on the bottom.  The Chocolate Heaven was a tasty flourless chocolate cake.  Soft and gooey in the middle.  Very chocolatey, which I like, but may be too much for others.  The Trifle Sinful was my favorite.  It was a Swiss roll layered with raspberry jam and custard.  It's a must try.  \\n\\nOverall, this is a great restaurant with amazing entertainment.  The wait for us was brutal, but I think it had to do with the seats we wanted.  I'd definitely recommend waiting for the good seats if you haven't seen the show before though.

I think it's the name. It sounds like a place in the heart of an old town that has worn floorboards and has been passed down in the family. The \\"ie\\" at the end of \\"Craig\\" really hammers that home. Dudes with names that end the same way most pet names do (aww, you're a cute little cheffie, you are!) really know how to have a good time. \\n\\nOR so I thought. \\n\\nLeave it to Boston to take a place with an adorable pub-by name and make it very modern, very overpriced and rather pretentious. Oh, Boston *sighs*. \\n\\nIf you want to try to get your date to drop their Chanel panties, or prove to your yachting Uncle that the time spent at Harvard really did help you find your truth, then by all means come here. Remember to wear your cardigan, preferably in a pastel shade. But for people who consider themselves more \\"white-ish\\" than \\"thoroughbred WASP\\", the groove here may not be your style. Also for mere mortals the check here is hefty. Baby elephant hefty. Entr√©e prices hover near 40 bucks a plate, apps almost 20, and desserts around 12 bucks. \\n\\nTHE FOOD: Meh. Good, I guess. The chef clearly cares and is a bit whacky. The kitchen tries some stuff it can't really pull off, but that's better than not trying. What I had:\\n\\nTrio of Amuse bouche (free)-Yay, free food! But tiny doll-sized free food. Forgot what they were, mainly tasted fishy. We get it Craigie, you're fancy. \\n\\nCrispy-Fried Essex Clams with preserved lemon, pickled peppers, dried black olive, squid ink ancho√Øade ($18)\\nThe sauce with the fried clams had squid ink, which translated to a dot of intimidatingly black, almost bloody tasting (like if you've had pig's blood in a sauce, that deep umami iron-heavy taste) aioli. It was unusual, not bad, but not truly satisfying. I didn't feel like I was indulging so much as spelunking in a murky cave of tastebud confusion.\\n\\nDate and Chicken Sausage-Stuffed Chicken with spiced yogurt, pea tendrils, pea hummus, raisin chermoula($38)\\nIt's one thing to kill a chicken because it's tasty. But then to stuff its sad lifeless carcass with the ground body of another of its feathered friends just seems a bit....rude. It was ultimately an overrated dish. After hearing Boston natives foam at the mouth while talking about it I expected orgasms. But it was not the juiciest chicken I've had. And for almost 40 bucks that needed to be one heck of a better buttered beautiful bird. \\n\\nSlow-Cooked Artic Char Mi-Cuit with peekytoe crab, quinoa, artichoke barigoule, za'atar, fennel puree ($38)-Tasted salmon-like to me. Delicately prepared, I liked the dill, and presentation. \\n\\nPavlova with Strawberry Consomm√© raspberries, goat's milk tapioca, tarragon ice cream ($11)-Favorite dish of the night. Well plated, good colors, and the tapioca provided a nice texture contrast with the merengue and tarragon ice cream. It tasted like a summer dessert should. I should note though that the pastry chef here clearly likes playing with savory flavors in desserts, which can be wildly unsuccessful sometimes (see below).  \\n\\nWhite Asparagus malted Milk Shake with rhubarb chantilly and graham cookies ($13)-I ordered this to see if they could pull it off. And the answer was no. Not really their fault though. The best case scenario of putting asparagus in a milkshake is the sugar bludgeons the asparagus to the point you can't taste it. Otherwise, it just tastes like you tried to sneak more greens into your three year old's diet somewhere and in a fit of desperation you liquefied it. In conclusion, all I learned from this is try as you might to make asparagus a dessert, it's not a dessert. Don't put asparagus in a milkshake y'all.

I like doughnuts, but they tend to cause me heartburn issues almost all the time after eating them.  So it is difficult for me to objectify any review of a doughnut.\\n\\nKnowing that, and then looking at what I have to say about these doughnuts may help put it all into perspective:\\n\\nTelling me that I would spend about six dollars for twelve mini doughnuts, or that other folks would stand in line for them, and be happy about it, would usually not be thinkable for me.  I was pleasantly and happily surprised.  You, if you have not been here, will likely be surprised also.  My only suggestion: Take some kids with you, you will be much richer for it if you do!\\n\\nI arrived and found parking on the street, and as it was about ten-thirty on a Sunday, I figured it would be nice and slow, this being my first visit to Pip's...  I walked to the location, thinking all was good and I was missing \\"all the folks\\" then I opened the door.... Surprise one: The place was packed, there were folks of all ages, and most notably, the groups had a high percentage of the \\"under twelves\\" represented.  There were lots of folks taking kids out for a quick snack and my order was about seventh in line.\\n\\nI ordered two dozen mixed doughnuts to go, and a large house brew coffee.  I took a place by the door and watched the interactions of all the folks in the room.  The place is oriented in an L shape with the door on the center of the bottom of the L and the tables to the left able to accommodate a small foursome or a large twosome, the space is cozy and could best be described as \\"quietly, and politely, busy\\".  Staff were also polite, friendly, and efficient.  The majority of the space was devoted to the staff to make the orders and drinks, and they were very busy. \\n\\nWhile I waited the ten minutes for my order to come up, I saw a lot of folks tasting their orders and there appeared to be a combination of worship, mixed with delight on all the faces of the folks present.  One little boy of about three, I observed, politely pointed at one mini-doughnut and told his father he was going to \\"eat the last one\\" of a specific doughnut, he didn't take it though, and it appeared that his statement put the parents in a bit of a conflict, possibly from the obvious appearance that that particular doughnut did not appear to have any more on the plate - Those specific ones appeared to be a very tasty commodity.\\n\\nMy order came up, and with the doughnuts, which were freshly cooked and confectioned and accoutered to order, I stole away home.  The mix we got were the six flavors of the day and were a great delight and surprise to all that tasted them, the biggest thrill I got was from two of them, the Honey with sea-salt, and another that was a bit sweet and tangy at the same time.

Boston is cold for about 75% of the year, so really the only acceptable time to wait outside for a table is during the summer. Generally expect to wait about an hour for a seat, unless you get here maybe 30-45 minutes before the opening time on a non core day (friday, saturday, etc)\\n\\nThis said, the food is really quite good here at Giacomo's. Everyone raves about the butternut squash ravioli, but I really didn't think it was anything special.

Because the restaurant holds great potential. It could be an excellent take out or casual dining option. That said, Home Taste - Arlington is not ready for the masses. My partner and I recently ordered take out - A lamb chinese hamburger, 8 fried dumplings, and noodles with chopped pork in fried bean sauce. We arrived before our order was ready. \\n\\nEach dish had its problems. The the flavor of the hamburger fillng was really, really good. Delicious. However, the filling was just warm, not hot, and the bun was stale - hard to bite through stale. \\"I can't finish that bread\\" stale. Next, the fried dumplings had clearly been made ahead of time. Maybe hours before our order and kept warm under a heat lamp or something. Our dumplings were not cooked to order. In our limited experience (we're not experts), fried dumplings should have a crispy outside, perhaps a bit of oil from the frying, and be HOT on the inside. These dumplings were not at all crispy and the filling, while very flavorful, was warm at best. The biggest problem was the wrapper. It was super gummy. Stick to your teeth doughy. Outside cooked, too thick dough (so, obviously handmade) not fully cooked. Finally, the noodle dish. We ordered it with hand-pulled noodles. Ours came with thin noodles. A simple fix for a new restaurant. But, once digging in, we failed to detect much, if any, bean sauce. The pork was flavorful. The cucumber crisp. For the portion size - and all dishes had generous portion sizes - there should have been more pork and cucumber. Even after thoroughly tossing the noodles, there were some servings without much meat or vegetable. \\n\\nThe bottom line? Our experience of the Home Taste - Arlington dishes had much to be desired. HOWEVER, everything could be really, really great with some attention to detail. Like \\"I gotta have noodles-with-pork-in-bean-sauce right now\\" craving good. Truly, there is great potential; we will return in a few months."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Very very nice ambiance and great food and service!

Last night we dined here with another couple. My husband and I split the ravioli with short rib ragu. I did not hear the waiter tell my husband that we would have to do the \\"splitting\\" ourselves because the chef does not like the way it is presented when it is split. Um, ok, aren't you a chef?  Can't you throw some greens on the plate with the pasta to make it look presentable?! Anyway when the runner kid brought out the pasta and two plates, I asked him if the kitchen wouldn't mind splitting that for us. Our table was quite full and I didn't want to do it. My husband had stepped away from the table so he wasn't there when this occurred. The boy said of course and took it back to the kitchen. A few minutes later he came back with the un-split pasta & two plates and said the chef would not do this for us. Well that just made me mad and frustrated. The pasta was not hot at this point and it just put a damper on our meal. My husband explained that the waiter indeed told him that we would have to split. I understand that I was in the wrong because I did not know this. However, one would think the chef would've just split the stupid meal and not send it back again!  Or maybe he should've handled it a different way? Or maybe the kid should've known the rules and explained it to me. The waiter came by and apologized over and over. Not his fault.

Again, everything was good, and just about ANY TX barbecue is leagues better than anything you'd get elsewhere, but the brisket we had turned out to be limp and fatty--with no rind, and no real flavor (the sauce doesn't count).

That is what is important for this specific Omni.  We have stayed here a few times over the past four years.

It is only about 10 minutes away.  Downtown Austin isn't that far when it comes to physical distance but you will have to fight I-35 traffic to get there (it can be brutal).  Although downtown isn't that far away, it can still take 20 minutes or longer to get there simply due to traffic. \\n\\nI've seen mixed reviews for the rooms here.  We have never been put in a room that wasn't clean and up to date.  The a/c has always been cold and the beds have always been comfortable.

So most of my stars are going to the great location.\\n\\nI find everything here to be overpriced.  Happy hour is only $2.00 off of everything on the drink menu, and while that sounds awesome, my $6.50 Dos Equis Amber is now down to $4.50, which is still overpriced in my opinion.  I ordered two hard shell tacos, one beef and one pork (which were small) and they were $3.50 a piece.  The tacos came out soggy which is extremely unappetizing when you're eating from, what is supposed to be, a hard shell.  The pork was terrible.  I'm not sure what flavor they were going for, but it was almost citrus-like and just wasn't good.  The beef was decent, but they definitely could be a little more generous with the pico and cheese.  I felt like I was just eating an all beef taco with no toppings.  Next I ordered the elotes, which was sub par.  I've had some pretty amazing elotes from other places and Rocco's didn't even hit the bar for me.  I think the chipotle mayo overpowered the other ingredients on it.  It needs more of the seasoning and cheese for sure.  The elotes was $5.50 for one corn on the cob.  However, I will say they have great chips and freshly made table-side guacamole, as well as queso.\\n\\nOur server was great when we got to our table.  He was attentive, took everyone's orders correctly, and made sure we always had enough water.  However, the service I received at the bar beforehand was a different experience.

My first thought was Chipotle, so I began to make my way to the Mueller area. Walking up to the Chipotle, I noticed Pokeatery right next to it, and I'm always down for a good poke bowl (which is a healthier, upgraded version of Chipotle, in my mind).\\n\\nAnd look, I understand this isn't what Poke is supposed to be (I apologize to all you Poke purists out there), but it is what it is - a mainstream way of eating Poke.\\n\\nOverall, I've never seen better value in a Poke bowl. From what I saw, it only comes in one size and that size is large. Sorry for bringing up Chipotle again, but my portion was larger than a burrito bowl. \\n\\nTo give an example of the level of customization in my bowl: I got half kale/half rice, crab salad, seaweed salad, seaweed, green onion, pickled ginger, tako (octopus), albacore, salmon, hamachi, wasabi, fried garlic, masago, and I can't remember the rest. That was about half of the available toppings. So take it for what it is, a very customizable and sizable Poke bowl.

The steak was absolutely fantastic, not at all chewy, and had some great seasoning and marbling. The hash browns were a nice filling side and the lobster mac and cheese was just Ok. The lobster mac and cheese was a little dry and lacking some smooth cheese. \\n\\nOverall a very enjoyable experience. Ruth Chris is definitely a step above your other steakhouses.

The hostess was very professional, talkative, and kind. Our server Rolando was nice, but was a bit rushed. He rambled off his questions and options to at a mind dizzying speed. However, our food came quickly, accurately and was hot and fresh. I enjoyed everything that I ate from the bread to the salad to the chicken wings, the sweet potato and the delicious peanut butter dessert. My only complaint is that it was freezing inside and my medium steak came out well done. But to Rolando's credit, he noticed the steak before I even said anything and he fixed the latter very graciously.

We decided to just deal with it and eat the beef, because we could see that our waitress was attending other tables and we didn't want to have to keep waiting for her because we were starving. After about 30minutes, my friend began to question when she was getting her meat patties that she ordered. So we told the waitress that we never received them and my friend told her to just cancel them; that she didn't want them any more. So later on once we received our tiny meals the same friend decided she would order chicken empanadas. So they brought them out and that was that. At the end when we received our bill, we say that they had charged us for extra empanadas and we were so confused. After not solving the problem, the waitress decided to just talk to her manager and have the extra food taken off. Later we discovered that they consider Meat Patties and Empanadas to be the same thing, and they had brought out my friends on a plate with the others before hand. But because we didn't know they were the same thing, we thought they were the empanadas that we had ordered.

The cheese is perfect, the sauce has the right consistency and flavor.  The dough is from a proud tradition, like all of its bread.  The pizza is not dry but not too greasy.  The cheese pizza is good, but I recommend the mediterranean pizza with spinach, feta cheese, tomato chunks, the works.  Just the right amount of spice from the region that it represents.  The 12 inch pizza go from 12 to 13 with the larger pizzas about 16.\\n\\nFor subs, they have almost everything.

Brunch is of course their prime time, so consider coming right when they open or around 1-2pm when the first wave starts to die down.\\n-Tiny steamed dumplings didn't do it - skin was dry, and the taste unfortunately bland.  Plus, they didn't have black vinegar to dip with - wtf!\\n-Spicy beef noodle soup was not spicy.  One of the three items on there with a chili sign.. so.. I expected.. you know, spicy.  Well it wasn't.  Also, could have used some bok choy, it was a bit heavy with just noodles and beef (which were good at least).\\n\\nThe Compromise:\\n-Lack of Parking.  Literally about 3-4 spots off-street.  On-street is a bit of a stretch as this is more off a residential area, so you'll be a bit confused finding street parking.  But there's actually ample space despite the restaurant being crowded - you just may need to walk a bit.  Just don't park at the adjacent McDonalds!\\n-Fried dough was HUGE and tasty - however, it was a bit too crispy (not enough dough, or they overfried it).\\n-Vermicelli with chitlins (pig's intestines, it sounds gross but trust me, this is a delicious Taiwanese staple) was very delicious and hard to find so well prepared in Boston, but missing pickled veggies.  How can you not add this, it's a staple in itself.  How.  Howwww??\\n- Shao-bing beef sandwich was solid, but dry.  Could have used Hoisin sauce.\\n\\nMaybe my standards are a bit higher since I eat some good ass authentic Taiwanese cuisine at home, and have scoured the streets of Taiwan nomming on street food in the past.  However, many dishes fell short of my expectations despite presenting a solid dish.  In any case, I do recommend trying the Vermicelli with chitlins.  Seriously.  Try it.  If I had to name a dish that represents Taiwan, it would be that dish, so swallow any second thoughts and be adventurous!"},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Because it's independent and because it has late night eats, this place deserves 4 stars.

Parking is ample outside of the restaurant. When you enter they have a large menu wall explaining the process. The interior is modern, and they have several servers who help you craft your bowl, so the line moves very fast- almost to fast to make a proper decision.  I got there during the lunchtime rush, but it didn't take long to get through the process.  You have to pick a \\n\\nSize- small, medium, or large\\n\\nBase- they offer unique bases including rice, veggie noodles, kale, greens and cauliflower rice\\n\\nProtein- they have a wide assortment of proteins, but their protein scoop is comically small. The bowl is primarily made of the base. \\n\\nMix Ins and Add Ons and Crunch- similar to other poke restaurants, they have a large assortment of veggies, salads, and crunchy things to top your bowl with\\n\\nFlavors- they have the widest sauce selection that I have seen and give great descriptions of each sauce\\n\\nI got 2 bowls (go big or go home)- One create-your-own and one Signature Bowl, the Sweet Tuna. I rarely get pre-made bowls but decided to try it out, and man was it good. The Sweet Tuna Bowl was FAR better than my create your own bowl of tuna, beets, pineapple, cucumbers and and other random things. My favorite part of the Sweet Tuna Bowl was the coconut flakes that were on top and added a great sweet flavor to the bowl. It was honestly SO good. If you are hungry I would recommend you getting a large size, but expect a significant amount of that to be your base with a smaller quantity of toppings."},{"name":"Pink Taco Boston","address":"374 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Went to pink taco Thursday night.

Horrible service + complete mismanagement = we never even got our food.\\n\\nFirst: we arrived at 5:45PM and as walk-ins with a party of three people, we were absolutely expecting a wait for a Saturday night. We were told 45 minutes of a wait, took a buzzer, and waited patiently. \\n\\n45 minutes later at 6:30PM, we checked in with the hostess, Rebecca, asked where we were on the list and were told \\"Oh, you guys are going to be seated next!\\" We then watched 12 different tables get seated ahead of us. We were able to get a drink at the bar and begged our bartender for some bread. I was able to get a Cesar salad, which even at starving level tasted just mediocre. At 7:00PM, we checked in again with the hostess (hour and 15 minutes after we got to the restaurant) and AGAIN were told \\"You're next.\\" As someone who's worked in restaurants for years, I could tell the two hostesses were clearly incapable of managing the crowds and had no clue what they were doing- so we politely tried to give them some space and be as friendly as possible. \\n\\nAt 7:30PM (an hour and forty five minute wait, opposed to the 45 minutes we were told) we asked the Hostess what was going on. She very rudely said, \\"well, we're seating all reservations ahead of you and it's not guaranteed.\\" UM, WHAT?! She then backtracked and said there were \\"other tables to seat right now\\" and then couldn't find us on her list. She literally couldn't find our name on her poorly written list. We wasted almost 2 hours waiting at this poorly run and ridiculously managed \\"restaurant.\\"  We asked to speak to a manager and were told that no manager was there... on a Saturday night... In the north End.  A server nearby saw we were beyond exhausted and frustrated with this disaster and was kind enough to try and help get a table for us. However, after a 2 hour wait and dealing with an incredibly rude and inept hostess, we decided not to spend another penny at this place. Worse, there was a crowd of about 15-20 people outside equally angry, who all were told similar stories from the hostess. One man told us he also waited 2 hours with his family after being told \\"45 minutes.\\" They also left angry and frustrated. It felt like they told everyone \\"45 minutes\\" and then placed waiting parties in spots where reservations didn't show up. A: What kind of stupid plan is that? And B: At least be honest about what you're doing. \\n\\nLook, there are plenty of MUCH better restaurants in the North End, and ones with far better management. You need experienced people running the door and managing tables, not some clueless, unorganized, rude, hostess who couldn't just tell us that we might not get a table.

When I closed out my tab at the front register the manager told me you should come tomorrow. So I was nice enough to comeback again because I don't wanna judge a business off it's first experience. The next day I came he moved me from one table to another for no reason it was unprofessional. I felt like they don't appreciate the customers value. When it was time to go I went up to the register to pay he charged me $50 for a hookah and a soft drink. I asked why? \\" because we have live music playing\\".

This is Boston. Thou shalt find no parking. You are going to be on Newb street anyway so just walk in and grab a table.\\n\\nThe service isn't overbearing or pushy. If you want to be there for a while they will let you do your thing. If you're in a rush they got you there too.\\n\\nThe food is pretty dope for the cheap price tag. And when I was there, they had the most bomb chicken fingers and fries. If you go here, you won't leave hungry and disappointed.\\n\\nAll in all, when this place reopens, hit it up. I don't recommend bringing a date you want to impress with your amazing credit card limit here, but for all other needs, it will be enough."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Outstanding service, impeccable southern breakfast cuisine, and an open friendly atmosphere.

I live in the neighborhood and had been wanting to drink/eat here. A friend called the day before and was enthusiastically told that, while Luce did not have a happy hour, they had $5 house wine and $2 antipasti, so it was like having happy hour all day long! Alllllright!\\n\\nWe arrived at Luce at 5 p.m. on Friday, 12/13/13. The place was mostly dead with only a couple of other tables occupied. The three of us were seated around a tiny table with our knees almost touching. Our server returned some time later, and we each ordered the house wine and some antipasti. \\"Okay, what else?\\" she asked. \\"Oh, that's it for now,\\" we said. Her expression darkened; her attitude shifted from lukewarm to frosty; and she curtly gathered up the menus and left. We struggled to whisper our confusion without banging knees and while avoiding our server's gaze as she bristled by. Hadn't we been welcomed in for an all-day happy hour the day before?  \\n\\nOur food arrived, all crammed on the same plate. Our plan was to get the F out and find some other place that actually liked people. We were one bite into our two-bite portions of antipasti when she flatly inquired whether she should bring us our check now. At no point did she inquire how our meal was, or whether we'd like to order more drinks or food items. I could understand if the restaurant was actually busy and she wanted to save tables for dinner parties. Then again, socialized people know how to communicate this. Had she been at all welcoming, we would have continued to order drinks and food. Isn't that the beauty of HH? We continued to confab around the table as to whether we should leave no tip or five cents. Would five cents convey that we weren't actually cheap bitches, just dissatisfied? \\n\\nFortunately, I'm a resident of Portland, OR, so all we had to do was walk a couple of blocks to find an establishment willing to accept our money with open arms and serve us portions of food that were better than decent and larger than two bites.

Sadly, it also proved to be the most disappointing.\\n\\nThe facility was surprisingly large, with multiple buildings the host patrons. We were there in a Sunday and it was absolutely packed: I think our wait time was about 40 minutes. This we didn't mind because we'd already waited in longer lines at other places on the trip. We were joined by some family members of mine, and had time to look over the menu. After being seated , the 3 of us ordered a plate with brisket, spare ribs, and sausage, along with half a pound of chopped pork. Upon getting the food the first thing we noticed was that everything was \\"cold\\". As if it had been sitting in the fridge and hastily and insufficiently reheated. In addition, all the meats were *really dry*, especially the pulled pork which was awful. The ribs were  clearly undercooked. The meat in general was pretty flavorless, and the sides failed the impress as well (had beans, cole slaw and potato salad). Worst Q we had out of 17 different places we tried.\\n\\nWe were aware of the cash only policy and came prepared but literally none of the other places we went to don't take credit cards. In addition, they wouldn't split the check for our table in 2.\\n\\nThough I have little doubt that Salt Lick once served good bbq (and maybe still can on some days), it's hard to not get the feeling that this is a place living off reputation, with many reviewers trying it because of its position as a \\"destination/landmark\\". That's fine and all but if it's good  Barbecue in the Austin area That you're seeking, I suggest trying Franklin, La Barbecue, Brown's, Valentina's, or one of the various other trucks, some of which are open for dinner (Scotty's).

We decided they must only hire models as their staff is quite attractive.  The ambiance is nice, but the inside is very small.  I ordered the fish sandwich, which was delicious and even better with the hot sauce, though it didn't pack much heat.  The sandwich is red snapper with avocado, it was paired with tostones, which are fried plantain slices.  Try them, you'll love them.   My friend got the Comunista platter which is yuca, rice and beans, and a salad.

The food is overpriced for what you receive, unless you maybe - order breakfast. The three times I've eaten here the food has been disappointing, but last night was by far the worst - both in quality and the manager's service.\\n\\nThere's diner food that's so-bad-it's-good, and then there's speciality sandwich/soup/salad shops you justify overpaying for because it's also good. Trident is neither. \\n\\nI ordered a deluxe grilled cheese on gluten free bread from their menu. It came out ungrilled, with avocado, a tomato slice, and unmelted provolone cheese. Perhaps it was a misunderstanding, which at that point, I was happy to explain and ask them to grill it for me. The food runner took it away and our server was back with in maybe 5-7 minutes later. It was no different, besides a thin dusting of black grill soot - which tasted like gas from the grill. The cheese was still unmelted. No thank youuu. \\n\\nThe soup itself was lukewarm, and explained as a tomato basil. It was ALL milk. You know when you make tomato soup from the can, and you fill the can with milk to coat the insides and add to the rest? It was legitimately, that color - with small pieces of tomato skin mixed in. It was also sour tasting. That's nasty. \\n\\nI didn't think I needed to explain why exactly my food was so terrible - it seemed pretty intuitive by looking at it. I told our waitress it wasn't good as politely as I could (after sending both back twice to allow kitchen to address the issues), and she apologized and was happy to do so. \\n\\nEnter management. \\n\\nOh my god. They charged us $25 for one coffee, one side garden salad, and one side pancake. The rest was in full. \\n\\nI called the manager over and explained more explicitly why the food was bad, how I hadn't eaten any of it, and how I would really appreciate the grilled cheese taken off our bill since I had sent it back once and taken one bite of it. He was dismissive, didn't apologize at all, and turned mid-heel as I was speaking to him and called to the server across the room to \\"take care of it.\\" We sat there for an extra 10 minutes waiting - unsure of how we'd be refunded. Mind you, the manager has passed our table 3 times setting up for the next day's trivia night. He comes by and says, \\"I don't really know if you're still waiting for me, but I've already taken care of the rest of your bill.\\"\\n\\nI actually wouldn't know that, because it wasn't communicated and you turned away while I was midsentence. I understand you don't care about the food your kitchen sends out, or how to treat people, but I'm not paying Newbury street prices for food I could have made cleaning out the back of the refrigerator at the end of the month.

They just have a long way to go.  Bf and I spontaneously drove up to Boston from NYC so naturally I had to look up some new places to eat.  LAH made Best of Boston list and seemed to have this modern/gastro edge to it- so why not??  Firstly, it doubles as an art gallery.  Interesting concept but sort of distracting from the food, which I think they need to focus on improving (they are only 5 months old).   The service was also spotty and slow (they mixed up bf's dish but they made up for it by buying us an app and dessert).  The space is also more art-gallery esque being modern decor, big and all but overall I felt it was bit empty and vapid.  Bf and I were sitting so far away from each other at our two top!\\n\\nAnyway, onto the meh food:\\n\\n- Free bread basket - meh dinner rolls and pecan raisin bread. Butter was good though, really sweet.\\n\\n- Started with the small size of Lithuanian Dumplings with pear, parm cheese and farmer's cheese. Beautiful presentation but more like a gnocchi than a dumpling.  Interesting and tasty but still not earth shattering. \\n\\n- The complimentary tuna tartare came out- great quality tuna, could have used a bit more dressing like truffle oil or something.. the accompanying rye bread was a bit dry (like dryer than normal)\\n\\n- BF ordered the kurobata pork, which was served medium rare with some parsnips (there just for texture). These were small luke warm pieces for $36.... they were trying to be modern and gastro but the food just didn't taste good.  We didn't taste the pine nut brittle or anything- the dish was more about presentation than anything else. They first time, they brought out the sea bass and because it was the wrong order, we had to wait 30 minutes for the entire meal to be re cooked and redone.\\n\\n- I had the famed Green Circle Chicken, which came from the communal roast (it's hard to understand the concept here in terms of cuisine- it's kind new American, Eastern European...).  Unfortunately the chicken was a bit dry in some parts and not juicy with a seared, crispy skin. I was let down.  I could make better chicken. $25\\n\\n-We shared a side of really delicious salted mushrooms which were good more due to the quality ingredient and a large side of herb frites - very good, shoe string style with mayo and ketchup \\n\\n- We had the pear consumme for dinner which again was trying to be artsy and modern failed in taste and complexity. The early grey ice cream could have been more flavorful as well as the toasted marshmellow thing atop but overall the best part was the pear and that's... well the crunchy pear for you. \\n\\nBF had two IPAs (well his first choice - they ran out of the keg), I had a glass of dryish Gruner and sugar caprinhna (not their fault I just don't know why I trick myself into liking cocktails).  \\n\\nDinner came to $160- they have a long way to go in terms of their food, concept, and service. Experimental I guess is not the way to go in Boston- I also noticed a a strong bar scene so perhaps that's where their strengths lay.  In terms of the art - meh.

One tidbit the server brought up that I thought was worth mention was that their draft beer lines are metal (maybe stainless steel, I guess I wasn't paying too much attention). This allows them to clean them out easier so they do about every other week.\\n\\nOn to the meals, my girlfriend ordered the chicken and cheese quesadilla. The other girl ordered the 7oz sirloin MW off the prix fixe menu that came with steamed veggies and another side. The guy ordered the same steak Med. \\n\\nI asked for the server's opinion on the three entree items on the prix fixe menu. The choices were crab cakes, sirloin or mushroom ravioli. He said, \\"I don't have anything bad to say about any of them. Normally I try to have at least a pro and a con in mind for every menu item but all three look really good tonight\\". I decided to go with the ravioli since 2 sirloins were already ordered and crab cakes can be pretty hit or miss for a guy that's not a big fan of mayo. The restaurant week menu came with a choice from 1 of 2 salads or a beef and cabbage soup and 1 of 2 desserts. I went with the spinach salad and the Buckeye dessert.\\n\\nAfter I finished ordering my girlfriend asked for an opinion on the Fish n chips. The server was a little hesitant but he finally came out with the fact that the quesadilla was just chicken and cheese in a tortilla and the fish n chips was the choice to go with so she switched it up.\\n\\nThe spinach salad was pretty standard; spinach, bacon, shredded cheese and hard boiled eggs. The warm bacon vinaigrette the salad came with was really good (my girlfriend ended up asking if she could buy some and apparently it's Marzetti's). The mushroom ravioli was a pretty good portion. The flavor was good and it was served in a pesto sauce with some toasted wedges of bread. The MW sirloin came out closer to MR. She didn't send it back but if you ask me I'd rather it come out under cooked as opposed to a hockey puck. It sounded like the steamed veggies could have used some salt/seasoning. The fish n chips was a huge portion. I bet there was a full pound of fish with the steak fries and Cole slaw.\\n\\nThe buckeye dessert was pecan crust filled with a layer of peanut butter mousse, topped with a layer of chocolate mousse, topped with whip cream and chocolate drizzle.

It was a Sunday and if you're not from the neighborhood it's difficult finding a parking place.  After we went around and around we finally found a spot.  The place was bustling and quite packed with quite a few people waiting for a spot.  Right away you know the place is hipster and trendy.  The music was blaring and it was really loud.  They have community seating along with tables.  I noticed they have boozy popsicles and I tried the strawberry daiquiri one.  It was good.  We also got the nachos and I really liked them although not everyone liked them as much as me.  I thought they were delish.  I then ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich in mild along with French fries.  The sandwich was pretty big and it had a nice crunchy cole slaw and it was a nice thickness and crunchy coating.  I could only eat a half of my sandwich.  The fries were like fair fries nice and hot and crispy.  I couldn't eat very many because I was so full from sandwich.  My partner got the Nashville chicken on a biscuit the medium style.   He said it was good but not outta this world.   Another in our party got the breakfast pizza and said it was good but not great either.   Earlier we had the hot pretzel with cheese and mustard sauces.  It was yummilicious and I'd say the appetizers were my faves.  I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way again but I'm glad I did try the place and I'd go back again.   But I'd try something different for my entree."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So good , I got the waffles and fried chicken breast.

They do not have any high chair so if you have a baby or young child, they'll have to sit on your lap or in a regular chair.  There isn't a lot of room between the tables so they probably wouldn't be able to fit a high chair.    Another thing is that they don't have any condiments/salt/pepper/sugar items on the table so if you want some pepper or add some sugar to your drink, you'll have to ask for some.  \\n\\nI ordered the house special pork chop.  The pork chop was juicy and good.  It was breaded as usual.  The sauce was lacking some flavor, which was why I was looking for some pepper and/or salt.  The items do come with a drink so I got coffee.  I wasn't expecting much since it was HK cafe, again why I was looking for some sugar too.  It would be nice if they had those on the table as other HK style places do. \\n\\nThe service was good and friendly.

We ordered the House Special for 2 (the giant seafood pasta platter) in Fracomo sauce and it was phenomenal. The linguine was al dente and the seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked, however I recommend taking out as much seafood as you can because the heat from the sauce continues to cook the seafood.

The wait on a Friday night was 1.5 hours for 4, but well worth it. The restaurant isn't large but it's definitely poppin'. It's quite dark but there's a great casual night out feel to it. \\n\\nThen, there's the tasty food!\\n+SALTY PIG PARTS: Can I first say how much I love that it's called this. We got 2 options: Prosciutto di Parma and Duck Liver Mousse. They were, of course, amazing. The prosciutto di parma was nice and salty, and the duck liver mousse was a great creamy contrast. This plate also comes with pickles and mustard.\\n+STINKY CHEESE: Also love how this is called stinky cheese (though there are some less stinky options). We chose the Brie de Nangis and the Dorset. The brie is divinely creamy (great for people don't like stinkier cheese in my opinion), and the Dorset is probably one of the stinkier cheeses I've had. However, I absolutely loved this one (though in smaller bites). We also chose to order fig jam and wildflower honey which paired so nicely. (If you haven't had wildflower honey, it has a nice floral hint!)\\n+BREAD: This is complimentary but don't be afraid to ask for more if you like your meats and cheeses with bread! They were really nice about refilling our bread and checked in on us for wanting more after the first time we asked.\\n+THE SALTY PIG PIZZA: It's slightly sweet with the pale ale caramel and is a great contrast with the mustard and salty pig meat. I'm not sure I could identify all of them, but it seems like ham and bacon. Great for salty sweet combo lovers!\\n+FUNGHI: This is definitely a heavier and creamier pizza in comparison to the Salty Pig. Still delicious but nice to have other dishes that can break up the creaminess. \\n\\nThe amount of food we got was too much for 4 people, but we didn't mind taking the rest home.

The first thing I noticed was that the \\"spicy\\" sauce was drowning the sushi. I was basically eating sauce with a fingernail sized piece of fish. The second thing that made it even better was the fact that the sushi rice was almost translucent and had no vinegar taste to it at all. The combo also came with kappa maki (cucumber roll) and it was the only thing that wasn't swimming in sauce but I ended up drowning it in soy sauce anyways since it didn't have a taste at all. Service was barely existent either since the serve was just standing and watching us from the counter if she wasn't zoning out and staring off into the distance.

The people next to us were on a first or second date and I can give you a play-by-play of their conversation.

Although tastefully decorated, the smaller rectangular space seems more suited to a cafe than a Mexican restaurant of this calibre....as were the rectangular marble tables.  Tasteful, but unexpected for a Mexican restaurant, where you usually find wood, or tile and wood.  \\n\\nWhen you want great atmosphere, go to the Venezuelan place in Watertown.  When you want a really sensational meal, go to Acitron Cocina Mexicana!

We ordered two veggie burgers for us and 2 large quesos for our friends on the phone. Run over to the place to pick up after waiting the 15 min they estimated. The lady at the pickup counter finishes her conversation with a friend/customer who's hanging out there and eventually asks what I need when she's done. Tell her about my pickup, she repeats it back to me and tells me the price. I pay for it, and she goes on to keep chatting with the girl at the counter without another word to me. Five-ish minutes later (the first time I'm acknowledged again) the lady says 'I guess they didn't tell you on the phone that we're out of chips'. No. Obviously not since you just repeated my order including chips to me. Instead of offering a refund she offers fries instead of chips. Ok sure. So here's the next catch: I wait 10-15 minutes for these fries. 'But they're fresh!', she tells me when I get them, which in hindsight I should have taken as an indicator that nothing else would be? Get home with all the food, and the fries that replaced the chips for my friends are indeed fresh, however the fries that came with the boyfriend's and my veggies burgers are now disgusting because they were left in the takeout Tupperware the whole time I waited, and are now floppy and cold. The queso was pretty good but not worth almost 8 bucks since they didn't even come with the chips. Also realized later that we only got ONE queso even though we ordered two (which doesn't really matter at that point) though we did only get charged for one. For context there were only four tables with customers the whole time I was there and I didn't even see anyone interact with any of them the whole time. An abundance of employees walking around aimlessly or chatting with the girl sitting at the counter. They gave us a 15 min ETA but I waited over 30 from placing the order to actually getting my food and they still screwed every possible thing up and didn't really make an effort to make any reconciliations. I will say that the blonde girl at the front was really sweet though she was on her way out when I got there but was the only person in the building who seemed helpful and capable of doing her job."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Fun place to bring a group.

However these are different, they are more deceptive in that they immediately take your pass and say they need to scan it, before they begin asking you questions, making it feel like there is an issue or something is wrong.\\n\\nI knew this, as I said, having passed these employees several times in the past. The gentleman took my wife's pass, she looked at me confused and so I informed her that it was just a survey and we don't have to take it, we can go join our guests. The gentleman taking the survey immediately got defensive, while at no point I addressed him or gave a harsh word towards them, the survey taker put his hand up to me and in a stern tone told me \\"you need to relax\\". \\n\\nThey both looked back towards her and said \\"we have to ask every third person to do this and it's only one question\\". I asked the two gentleman to clarify \\"but does that mean that she has to take the survey?\\" The 2nd gentleman ignored my question and said \\"We have to ask and it's only one question\\". So I asked again, \\"but does that mean she has to take it?\\" After a long pause, again they said \\"It's just one question\\". \\n\\nMy wife responded \\"Fine, but will you hurry because we are trying to see our family.\\" So they asked what country we were from, she said American. Thinking that was it, he started with his SECOND question, \\"What is your zipcode?\\" she responded with \\"Is that the ONE question?\\" clearly confused since he as still wasting our time. He proceeded to ask a couple more before finally letting us go.\\n\\nI've held my tongue for a long time about how manipulative this tactic is, but after the way we were spoken to and the pure waste of our time this was, I didn't feel like just letting it go as I have in the past. I have always been very courteous when we've been asked to do a survey in a theme park, They are always forth coming, the try and tempt you with incentives, and there are times I've done them and times I haven't. But it's always been a choice. You KNOW what you are doing. You are being manipulative, making people feel this is a required thing as guest enter your gates and you waste their time, time that could be spent having fun with your family. \\n\\nBut instead, you show that your data collection is more important than your guest experience. The gentleman who was at the front gate in particular should be ashamed of himself and the way he handled the situation."},{"name":"Revelry","address":"210 SE Mlk Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I enjoyed an excellent meal here on a Saturday evening.

Everything's fresh, and there's great options for those who are in WeightWatchers (lots of zero point foods), or on any other managed eating plan.  You can eat well, have a very tasty meal, all for a very reasonable price.  Example: there's the choice of cauliflower rice over regular rice; veggie noodles instead of regular rice or pasta-type noodles. It's like having a meal of sushi without the food being wrapped in rice; it's just in a bowl. \\n\\nYou pick the size bowl you want and decide the number of scoops of protein -- chicken, beef, salmon, tuna, and spicy tuna (there might have been tofu available for vegetarians, but I didn't pay attention to that). Then you start with your base of rice and/or noodles (again, vegetarian options for both), and then continue to add on.  Options, options, options!\\n\\nI only have a couple of complaints.  First: the wasabe paste was put in the bowl (on the side); I would have preferred it in its own side container so I could mix it with soy sauce and use like I would with a normal sushi meal.  Second: the place is noisy, so I had difficulty hearing the server explaining things to me.  And lastly (although this is not really a complaint): there needs to be more than one location than just at Perimeter!  Sweet Tuna needs to spread out across the area.

A friend of mine told me that she went on that previous Sunday morning and the wait time was over an hour.

There was an entire peewee football team (with parents and cheerleaders) at the table behind us.\\n\\nWe each got a different kind of meat for our platter so that we could share all around - sausage, brisket, ribs, and turkey.

I'm an Asian American student, not a pizza connoisseur. If you were to hold me at gunpoint and ask me where Naples is, I won't be able tell you. But I will give you my honest opinion, free of glitter and fancy words.\\n\\nThe restaurant is always busy around the clock; the line was out the door when my party got there (5pm on a Saturday). Wait time however was pretty quick, and seats weren't all too hard to find. It's BYOB, but if you forget, they also sell a few beverages, like pellegrino. If you're too cheap for drinks, they have plastic cups at each table, and faucet water to drink (literally they pointed to a faucet when I asked for water). \\n\\nThey don't come short when it comes to the quality of ingredients. The whole business is entirely transparent. There's a rack of proofing dough in plain sight when you walk into the dining room, and ovens blazing in the back. The toppings were even top notch qualities, the pickled peppers were tasty, garlic was fresh, and the parmesan was good (I got an extra cup to eat separately). \\n\\nThe pizzas are roughly $20 a pie. That's kinda pricey, for a student like me. It's roughly a medium size delivery pizza, and can feed 2 people comfortably (they're not that small). From what I read in the reviews, there are 3 pizzas that yelpers would die for. If you wanna be safe, go for the margherita pizza. If you're fine with anything, get the San Gennaro. If you're a bit adventurous, order the Diavola. The pizzas come out really quick, so find seats ASAP. \\n\\nDIAVOLA - $21\\nSo I ordered the diavola pizza with my girlfriend. The pizza was topped with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. In English, it was topped with some fancy pepperoni, spicy peppers, and fancy mozzarella cheese (sorry guys). The sopressata salami tasted a lot like regular pepperoni, just a tad bit more fattier and more savory, but not a whole lot difference. The peppers were a nice addition, and had a little sweetness that added to the pizza. The bufala tasted like regular mozzarella, I couldn't really tell the difference. The problem I had with this pizza was that it was really salty. I didn't taste any balance in flavors, just the saltiness from the sopressata. To add to that, the pizza was a bit on the dry side and oily on top, contributing to the need for water or some other beverage. The crust was a bit thick for me, compared to the rest of the pizza.\\n\\nI tried the margherita pizza, which I thought was better than the diavola pizza. It was simple and classic: not much you can mess up on. Also, try to eat the pizzas as quickly as possible, as they tend to turn soggy the longer you wait. In the end, I wasn't amazed by the pizzas, they were just okay. Basically my two cents is this: as a yelper virgin to authentic Italian food, I'm not sure if this place is worth the hype. I will definitely visit this place again when I'm in the area, but for now, I'd suggest trying one of the other amazing restaurants in Midtown."},{"name":"Chinese Sauerkraut Fish","address":"4940 Number 3 Road, Suite 101","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious sauerkraut fish!

They serve you up with a basket of traditional soda bread and a guinness/maple syrup/ olive oil combo for dipping, it's really delicious. And it's a good thing for that bread, because even if you don't come that hungry, you will be starving by the time you are seated, as the wait time here is just ridiculous. I came to Downtown Disney two nights in a row and attempted to eat at Raglan Road the first night, but with over an hour wait time, I nixed it.

One plus is that there is usually not a cover to get in and there is always a decent crowd. Their wings are pretty good and drinks are priced on par with other bars/clubs in Atlanta. \\n\\nThe reason that I am only rating this place two stars is because some of the bartenders here will try to rip you off in attempt to get themselves a bigger tip. Gratuity is included so obviously the higher your tab is, the higher their tip is. A few weeks ago when I visited, I opened a tab and when I closed it out, noticed that the bartender added several Fiji waters to my tab which I did not order. When I informed her of the mistake, she told me that someone else in my party ordered them on my tab, which I knew was not the case. Instead of printing out a new receipt to fix the error, she just handed me cash to cover it, which was also odd.\\n\\nI again visited Escobar on 2/23/19 and happened to have the same bartender. I ordered a few drinks and when I closed out my tab, only received the receipt that had a total and and place to leave a tip and not an itemized receipt. I asked the bartender for an itemized receipt and when I got it, noticed that the total was less than the previous receipt. It was obvious that the bartender tried once again to charge me for items which I did not order. \\n\\nI like this bar a lot, but its just unfortunate that they have employees who will try to rip off customers.

The Caesar salad was very bland, the sauce limited and runny, and the croutons were smaller than dice. The gnocchi was tasty, but there was too much sauce and the dough was rough. My personal preference for delicious gnocchi is that it almost melts in your mouth, and you won't get that here.  \\n\\nOn my second night I had the margherita pizza, which was also rather bland. \\n\\nThe redeeming quality of AF is the fact that you can make reservations online, and the bartender!!! On my first night she saw that our waiter was taking forever to come and take our order and she took it for us. The second night, we sat at the bar because we liked her so much and she was very sweet and considerate of our orders and not constantly asking how our food was.

After my stab at it, I can say that I understand why it's not on the menu, and why Chef Tony Maws treats it as a bit of a sideshow.  It's amazing, to be sure, but there are a few caveats.\\n\\nEmily G. and I came here with a mission: lets see if the burger experience really stacks up to the hype.  Many of us have heard by now that Chef Maws has created what he believes to be the pinnacle of burger achievement.  For my part, I'd say he's not wrong.  Hugely flowing with umami, the blend of meats, suet, dehydrated miso, and bone marrow creates a flavor and mouth feel that is completely unrivalled in any other burger experience.  My burger was made by someone with a lighter hand on the salt and pepper, and so was just slightly underseasoned, but by no means bland.  The soft but structurally sound bun, the light touch of cheese, just a few rings of red onion, and a thin leaf of lettuce lightly coated with their house ketchup is the perfect base construction, and that's how I enjoyed it.  For those wanting more accents, a side plate of extra house ketchup, house pickles and house celery root slaw is served - the last being made with a spicy mustard.  \\n\\nBut let's be clear here: this is a \\"burger\\" like a Ferrari F430 is a \\"car\\".  Yeah, it's got wheels and an engine and you drive it, but you're not taking it to work every day.  This thing is HEAVY. And by that I mean, it's going to sit in your stomach like a big, sleepy atomic bomb. I love that chef Maws has constructed his ideal of what a burger should taste like, and I'm happy to have experienced it, but I'm probably not going to try for it again anytime soon. \\n\\nRATHER: I'm interested in trying a tasting menu. After experiencing the pure joy that was the pig's tails - little fried nuggets of porky heaven - and the smoky, salty delight of the bacon-roasted corn on the cob, I'm ready for more of the Craigie menu!\\n\\nService, is, as many have said, impeccable, and the cocktails here are pure delight.  Never mistake though, this is not your everyday dining destination - prices on everything are pretty high, but that's to be expected from a top-tier master chef who creates a seasonal, local menu, and sources his foods responsibly.  \\n\\nCraigie is, as DeNiro said of the bank job in \\"Heat\\", worth the stretch."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious.

Generous portions, which I appreciate.  We ordered huevos rancheros, which came with decent tomatillo sauce and toppings, but the corn tortillas were quite dry - almost flaky.  However the sweet plantains were a home run for me - thick and chunky, perfectly caramelized exterior, soft and sweet interior - heavenly. We also ordered a \\"Choose Your Own Eggventure\\", which is basically a customizable benedict, and the Kale Quinoa Breakfast Bowl.  Both of which were pretty standard - not bad, not great, but satisfying.  We also split the \\"Mega Tots\\" which are exactly what they sound like: three giant tater tots with cheese baked into the center.

If you're in the downtown Atlanta area (specifically near The World of Coke or Centennial Park), this should be on your list of breakfast spots to try.  Sometimes you just want a good, basic diner-style breakfast, nothing fancy. This place hit the spot.  They are known for chicken and waffles and that's what I got. I wasn't disappointed.  Chicken was fried crisp and there was a lot of it! (wings) So much so that we got a to-go box for the chicken to eat for lunch later.  The restaurant was bright and the staff friendly.  It didn't take long for us to receive our food and we had free refills.  There is also a lunch menu, but we didn't try lunch.  They had items like club sandwiches, bacon melts, etc.  \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience. The only issue is the parking, but I didn't want that to affect my overall review.  Not many spaces in front of the restaurant and no parking on the street, so we ended up parking around the block.  It wasn't a busy morning for downtown Atlanta, but I can imagine if there is a major event going on it might be a bit crazy. So plan ahead if you're driving and be patient because you may have to circle a few times.  If you're staying at a hotel nearby, walk don't drive. Much easier and that way you can take a detour through Centennial Park to walk off the chicken and waffles!"},{"name":"Teranga","address":"1746 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place had been on my to-try list forever, and my roommate and I finally went for a \\"you're almost done with finals\\" dinner, and I'm so glad I did (and so upset I hadn't tried this place earlier). \\n\\nIt's a pretty intimate and potentially romantic spot, but it was also good for us having a casual conversation.

The decor is old, furniture is cheap, waitresses don't make small talk, there's a single sushi chef, and the happy hour menu is on a small strip of paper. But their rolls are so cheap and so good! The fish is fresh and they put a lot in each piece. They also use real crab in their California rolls and you can definitely taste the difference between Aki's Cali rolls and other places' Cali rolls that use imitation crab meat.As other people have already mentioned, the priority here is taste and value over presentation. The rolls are haphazardly rolled and not very pretty but they are tight and don't fall apart on you. I have no complaints in that respect, my main goal when eating sushi is getting a good deal on fresh and quality fish, after all. \\n\\nRolls during happy hour run for $2-$3 and outside of happy hour are about double that. Rolls range from 4-8 pieces but the ones we got (yellowtail, California, tuna/spicy tuna, eel) all had 8 pieces each.

I think the pulled pork was the best out of all that we tried, followed by the brisket. They were all perfectly smoked and absolutely tender - no knife needed!

My husband and another couple had tickets to the ballet and wanted to do dinner too as an early Valentine's celebration. We decided to eat here because the Cobb Energy Center website listed it as being convenient to the venue. We made a reservation for 6:15 and were one of only a few tables when we arrived. Despite this, the servers seemed very confused about who was supposed to take our table. The first waiter that came over was friendly and told us the app specials but then walked away without taking our order. The next waiter that came was very surly and unfriendly. He asked what we wanted for our entrees and we told him we hadn't ordered appetizers or heard all the specials. I am not exaggerating here- he audibly SIGHED before rattling off the specials. Each couple ordered appetizers, oysters on the half shell and calamari, the couple we were with ordered drinks. The appetizers were pretty slow to come out but we agreed that they were both pretty good. At this point, none of us have any liquid in our glasses. My friend tried to flag down our original waiter who looked right at her and turned the other way. Finally, we flagged down a waitress that wasn't even ours just to get some water and she took care of getting some alcohol refills. When the entrees came out, they were brought out by a food runner and the waiter never came back to ask how everything was. My salmon was decent. The portion of both salmon and sauteed spinach were small but there enough potatoes to feed a family of four. At $19, it was reasonably priced but I have made better salmon at home for much cheaper. My friend said her elk tenderloin was underseasoned and my husband's grouper was not filleted properly so one end was really thick and one really thin so the thin side was extremely overcooked and chewy. It was served with steamed vegetables of the Applebee's variety. At $25, that was kind of annoying. The other couple we were with sat without alcohol throughout most of the meal. After the busboy cleared our dinner plates, we sat there with no food on the table and no drinks in any of our glasses for a good 15 minutes and no one ever came by. My friend flagged down the waiter to tell him that we would have loved to have had more drinks and dessert but that now we didn't have time so we just needed the check. He said \\"ok\\" and walked away, came back and set the check on the table without a word. No comp on an appetizer or a drink, not even an apology. So what turned out to be a $150 tab could have been well over $200 if the douchebag would have just checked in periodically.  The most annoying thing was that by the end of our meal the restaurant was pretty full and we noticed that the large party behind us was being lavished with attention and also that there was complimentary bread that we never got.

Trust me, I grew up in North Dakota & didn't have my first Pad Thai till junior high school--Vietnamese people may be crazy enough to immigrate to the southern Canadian annex, but not the Thais!  Where was I?  Oh yeah, so after escaping to the pacific northwest I got drawn into the college crowd & got hooked on pad thai & green curry.  Sometimes I remember that fateful first bite of spicy heat, thick creamy curry with that zing of basil & sweet crunch of bamboo shoots that led me down a path of pineapple curry fried rice, Swimming Rama & the highly addicting black sticky rice but that's a post for another day.\\n\\nThe green curry here is sooooo tasty.  Creamy coconut, sweet green peas, carrots, & bamboo shoots, & that scrumptious aromatic basil will perk you right up no matter how much you're slogging from last night's debacle or debauchery.  The curry is a little runny but that just means you get plenty of flavor to coat the fragrant starchy jasmine rice.  They remember what you like & will ask you the next time if you want to forgo the green bell peppers--Yes, please!  The pad thai is made with traditional tangy tamarind sauce & not that frightening pink sauce they favor up north (Yes, I'm talking about *you* Seattle!), crunchy bean sprouts, egg, chunks of tender chicken.  A bit on the sweet side for me & I wouldn't complain if there were more veggies but otherwise delish & with the massive portions they give you it's good to know that it tastes just as scrumptious the next day [burp!].  If you like spicy & tangy go for the pineapple curry & be prepared to inhale the massive rectangular flat of food in microseconds.  Luckily I've learned not to put any appendages near Capt Hook when he gets that look in his eyes....Now if I could only get my caboose downtown more often & I'd be tasting the spicy eggplant tomorrow.

Ahhh... $12 down the drain for size small triangles. \\n\\nNow the BBQ part. We ordered Combo #1 and Combo #2. Each combo was enough for 2 people according to the menu. it came with a side of veggies consisted mostly of onions, very little mushroom or broccoli or anything else. It also came with 2 bowls or rice which they've forgotten to give us until we asked and by the time it came, we were completely done with combo #1. \\n\\nThe Beef had good flavor but was so dry.

The table next to us - they forgot their combo #2 and took forever before it came. \\n\\nThe older waitress just placed all our food on the grill after it was heated up. She gave us one tong and we were weary about using it to pick up the food to eat since it was touching all the raw meats. We had to move the meat around to get it all cooked thoroughly since they touched each other and were afraid to eat anything too raw. \\n\\nI must have mistaken but i thought she would just have placed the plate on the table and we would have just cooked the meat we wanted to eat instead of all being put down at the same time. the meat of course were over cooked because it was still on the grill as we were eating it. \\n\\nCombo # 2 was very sad.

My date and I both got omnivore tasting menus (50$ pp) and a few cocktails. We both came away not sure whether the chef needs to be helped or just chastised, so here's some of both.\\n\\n1. A tasting menu should not consist of smaller versions of a few menu items.\\n\\n2. A tasting menu should showcase the chef's identity. An idea, a theme, a style of cooking, /something/. It should give and show me what the chef wants me to taste and experience. E.g. a charcuterie plate, where I assemble my own bites, has no place in a tasting menu.\\n\\n3. For the love of god, the food should taste like something I should feel ok paying $50 for.\\n\\nFirst course, basically a charcuterie plate. Not a great start, but a couple decent pickled things (one asparagus spear and two thin slices of carrot. Fine.) A fairly bland pate, and basically two versions of very thin lard strips. Fine. Cautiously optimistic at this point\\n\\nSecond course, a giant bowl of mussels in the simplest imaginable white wine and lemon sauce, sprinkled with a bit of feta cheese, served with nothing else. No bread, nothing. Ok, feta on mussels, kind of a neat thought, but not a very successful harmony. But the mussels themselves are something I could whip up at home with minimal effort, prep, or thought. Acceptable , but hope is waning.\\n\\nThird course, are you kidding me? Two dry strips of hangar steak on a bed of rice that I swear to god came out of a box 10 minutes prior and was not ever touched by even a faint glimmer of spice, sauce, or salt. Uncle Ben's is way more flavorful. Store-quality hot sauce, and literal dollop of sour cream (which I learned from the menu later is \\"crema\\". Right.) A cold, corn tortilla.\\n\\nAre you kidding me? I thought we were going French, and suddenly we veered into, not Mexico, but a small town in Ohio's idea of Mexico? Why?? Who on earth would think that someone coming in for a tasting menu to a restaurant advertising farm to table wants bad Mexican food as their main course?\\n\\nDessert, a bland, dry \\"buckwheat cake\\" (no glimmer of buckwheat flavor, which would've been interesting, but every bit of buckwheat's moisture sucking. Yay!) served with something the waitress only called \\"brittle\\", which looked and tasted like dimestore glass candy bits, and a \\"black pepper ice cream\\", which was... vanilla.\\n\\nThis is not even to mention that the waiters were brisk and inattentive, with short explanations of each course, bordering on rude. A single slice of bread came out in the beginning without a word (is it sourdough? Why am I guessing?) an amuse bouche of pickled mushroom was the only interesting thing in our entire meal, but came in a shot glass (our neighbor's was on a normal, human plate. Did they run out for us?) and was never mentioned at all until I asked what it was.

Shishito peppers were tasty and the dipping sauce was so good I continued to dip my chips in it. Finally, the fried chicken sandwich was good. Messy due to the egg yolk but tasty.

I love it! And I describe it as maddening, since both times I've been here the service is a little ehhhhhhh. The service gradually warms up, both times, at both separate locations, but each time they have originated with this almost awkward knee-jerk reluctance at having to WAIT ON JUST ONE SOLO DINER, EEEEK. Even though both times have been weekdays. And both times the restaurants were only half full. And for this reason I'm deducting from a perfect rating, since as a frequent business traveler and former collegiate server, that irks me to no end. \\n\\nI order, I gorge, I tip well, I leave. So let's go to the gorge part. The food is great, and the prices are reasonable. Both times I have ordered (and will continue to order as long as work has me in Orlando) the half chicken (chewy, crispy dark skin and luscious juicy meat); ripe plaintains (my utter weakness after becoming addicted to them while honeymooning in Jamaica); red beans and rice (one of my favorite sides). The two sauces are delicious, a spicy green and a creamy white garlic: perfect for dunking chicken and plaintains into. The total bill runs me about $15 and I am STUFFED afterwards. \\n\\nGreat food, was consistent at both locations.

This is one of my favorite restaurants, if not my favorite, in Atlanta. I've been there during the week and on the weekend and both times I've been blown away. First off, I would definitely recommend making reservations. We had reservations for a Saturday night at 7:30. We kept having to push it back and they were super accommodating of our time changes. We finally showed up around 8:45pm and we had to wait around 15 minutes to be seated. The place was PACKED! I was shocked by how packed it was so late on a Saturday. So -- be aware if you go on a weekend night it will be super busy and lively. When we left around 10:30 there were still people waiting for a table. \\n\\nThe food is tapas style so order lots of small plates. The food is so good so this will allow you to try a lot of it! The tapas I've had and LOVED include: gambas de ajillo, patatas bravas, truffle whipped goat cheese, and the grilled asparagus. There were others too that I can't remember but I know I loved those ones! \\n\\nAll in all the restaurant has such a fun atmosphere, great atmosphere, and long wine list -- what's not to love?!"},{"name":"The Old Mohawk","address":"821 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Like Bryant M., this is a \\"good three stars\\" -- It's a consistent, friendly neighborhood joint and I come here relatively often. \\n\\nFirst, this is a great place to enjoy in the winter. When you open the door, you will be pleasantly blasted by extremely hot air. You'll have to go through a second door to get to the restaurant itself, so enjoy the little violent heat chamber when it's frosty outside. On my last visit, we were seated in the corner table by all the windows-- it was so pretty looking out on the corner of Mohawk and Kossuth with German Village all decked in holiday cheer. \\n\\nSecond, the beers on draft are above average. I've bellied up to the bar here and lost track of time quite a few times. \\n\\nThird, great service. Everyone's always been friendly and helpful.\\n\\nFourth, slightly more interesting food than you'd expect. I usually get the turtle soup. Yep, with turtle in it. There's a rotating list of daily specials that I expect hasn't changed for decades and decades. There's really something for everyone on the menu-- the quesadilla section is kind of interesting. Anyway. I mean, look, the food is not bad, but it's just straight-up comfort basics, with plenty of variety. I think the menu could use some updates, but I gather the traditionalism is part of the Mohawk's schtick. \\n\\nSometimes it smells a little funny inside, but I'll chalk that up to well-loved neighborhood patina. Sometimes feels like it could use a good cleaning. Still, Mohawk is reliable and enjoyable. I live within walking distance of it, so my adoration is definitely neighborhood-related.

We didn't know what this was but I'm a fan of both scallion and tofu so figured I'd like it. And we all did! It's a delightful silken tofu cold dish, with the tofu covered in a sauce of sesame oil, peanut butter, and scallion. Very refreshing and a great opening to the meal.\\n\\nNext we had D4, which was the hot oil hand pulled noodles. We've had this dish at Gene's before and I actually liked this one more than Gene's. It was very flavorful and easy to mix. The bok choy that came with it was very snappy and tasty too.\\n\\nWe also ordered a serving of pan fried pork dumplings. I love thick skinned dumplings which these are-- very chewy and the meat filling was solid too. To the reviewer who complained that these weren't called Peking Ravioli-- as a Chinese person, I have never heard of anything called Peking Ravioli and if I saw it was called that I would've been rather turned off (ravioli makes me think of cheese which I would hate to have with a good dumpling). I think the fact that they are labeled as dumplings with hand pulled skin should show that these are thick skinned, like how thick their noodles are. But you can insult them-- I think the dumplings can take it since they are so thick skinned :)\\n\\nLast we finished with the fried pork casserole. We weren't really sure what to expect from this one either. It was a soupy dish with fish ball, seaweed, bamboo, and fried pork, as well as with some thin vermicelli style noodles.

Taps and tacos and politos. \\n\\nAfter carefully thinking of which one to go to we opted for the cheaper version cause we stingy af .. we decided to go to politos knowing their tacos were cheaper. We drove in and saw there was actually quite a few people. Very big space, bright, and nice decor. Very simple.\\n\\nWe were seated right away and though it took a little longer than expected for someone to take out order..it was fine because they were super nice and Welcoming. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering 4 tacos and 1 pupusa. We both had a carne asada and pollo taco with a pork, sweet pepper and cheese pupusa.\\nMy initial thoughts seeing the tacos I was thinking oh not bad they look like sal y limon. Your authentic looking corn tortilla tacos. Taking my first bite into them I was pleasantly surprised at the flavors and juicyness the meat had. Each taco had their spice and flavor profile and they were all amazing. The pupusa came shortly and it was delicious. Crispy on the outside soft and chewy on the inside. \\n\\nIt was so good I decided to order another chicken, beef and now I wanted to try the pork with pineapple. This was good as the flavor profile was great but my only gripe is that it was close to being too dry. Other than that it was great. \\n\\nAll in all this place is amazing with a terrific staff. Tacos were great and cheap at $3 And on Tuesday it's 4 tacos for $10. Pupusa was fabulous.\\nMy only constructive criticism is that you need more types of tacos and pupusa. Something like fried shrimp, fried fish, grilled fish, lengua. Some sort of creativity would be good. Also maybe making a deal of 10 Tacos for $20 because I would come back every week..\\n\\nAmbiance 5/5 service 5/5 value 5/5 taste 4.5/5"},{"name":"Kerbey Lane Cafe - Mueller","address":"2200 Aldrich St, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"My kids love Kerbey Lane but this location has a lot of staff training to do.

(The answer is to not put that brand down.) It was leaking and lacked any semblance of spice. In fairness, even decent JA restaurants may not get the patty correct. But then I ordered Sorrel. Now its close to Christmastime, so Sorrel pretty much is in perfect season for restaurants given its popularity as a Christmas drink.

I overheard that they don't have a full liquor license, so the hard liquor that they serve has to have a higher sugar content than normal.  For example, the gin they use is infused with honey.  The gin is lovely, but I would guess that the added sugar lowers the alcohol content.\\n\\nThat being said, there are a lot of liquors used in some of their drinks that I have never heard of.

We ordered a panini and a salmon burger, and two kids salmon meals.  We went there for the advertised kids meal discount, which on their board in front says \\"Kids Grub 0.99, every night 4pm-9pm/all day on weekends, kids must be 12 years old or younger. Does not include a drink. Must purchase a panini, salad, or entree in order to receive discount.\\"  Instead of being charged $2 for the kids meals, we were charged $6. When I brought this to the attention of the cashier, she said that the discount is $5 for the kids meal.  I told her that it is advertised as 0.99 for a kids meal. When I asked the manager Kelly, she also said it is 0.99 for a kids meal. When I showed her the sign in front of the business establishment advertising the kids meal, she said \\"Well, the sign is wrong.\\" When I asked to speak to her manager, she said \\"He's on vacation.\\" OK. This is clearly false advertisement, made worse by the fact that one week ago I went to the same establishment and ordered the same kids meals, and received them each for 0.99. There are clearly issues with false advertisement at F2O, and mind-boggling poor customer service. State and federal laws are in place to protect consumers from false or misleading advertising. These laws make deceptive claims illegal. No business may make false, misleading, or deceptive claims about a product regarding its price.

The guy working carry out seemed very flustered and overwhelmed and there were about 8 orders sitting in baskets, getting cold. They were helping customers very slowly so in all, I waited about 20 minutes to collect my order. It was all the more frustrating because there were 5 employees just standing around at the host stand. Finally a manager jumped in to cash all of us out while the other guy distributed the food, but that really didn't speed things along. The guy in front of me had already cashed out with the manager, but when he received his food he was told they still needed a signature. We stood there for a full 5 minutes while the carry-out worker messed around on the computer and then came back to say he didn't need a signature after all.

I hope your search for this wonderful cheesy sandwich goes better than my experience with Rueben's."},{"name":"Burro Bar South End","address":"1357 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The one word that comes to mind is disappointing. Burro Bar has a stylish interior. We were offered to sit on their deck, which was basically just an extra, less interesting room, since it was completely enclosed. The drinks are fine, but at $12 a margarita, i would expect it to be exceptional.\\n\\nThe food and service was where they really feel short. Our orders came out wrong, which happens, but the lack of concern was disappointing. One person at our table for brunch order their French Toast. This came out as a mushy mess, that was undercooked and eggy. Sure, you don't expect French Toast at a Mexican place to be great, but just don't put it on the menu if it's something you can't handle. We also ordered homefries which were so undercooked they were like eating a raw potato. When the entire order went untouched, the waitress didn't even ask about it, just cleared the table and gave us our overpriced bill. \\n\\nI had high hope for this place, so I was so disappointed by our experience (and this was our second bad experience having gone for dinner before)."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"301 Great Rd","city":"Bedford","stars":"2.5","text":"Despite convenience, I try to completely avoid this location.  I tried it about half a dozen times over the past year, and every time I wish I'd went elsewhere.  The rice and meat (usually go with steak) are usually dried out, though I'm not sure if this is due to sitting out or just being overcooked.  The last time even the chips were soggy.

The Yelp reviews looked very promising.\\nClearly, this must have been graded on a bell curve.\\n\\nThe evening started out fine enough. The hostess and wait staff were very attentive and responsive. Good start.\\n\\nFirst we were served a basket of warm focaccia. It came with olive oil flavoured with herbs and grated parmesan cheese. The bread was served warm and it was amazing with the olive oil. We devoured 2 baskets before our appetizers came.\\n\\nThis looked promising indeed. Would I be the hero with the new culinary find?\\nUnfortunately, not tonight.\\n\\nThe train slowly start to come off the tracks. I realized that I was duped by another case of a Groupon discount hiding mediocre food.\\n\\nOur appetizers included sausage with grilled rabe and crispy polenta (greasy) and veal meatballs in a marinara sauce with shaved parmesan (bland).\\n\\nOur main courses included stuffed pork loin with mashed potatoes and a chicken, mushroom, pea and pancetta over fusilli in a tomato cream sauce. Both were even blander than the appetizers.\\n\\nThe funny part is that from Southie, we had to drive by the North End and East Boston (Rino's) to eat at this Revere eatery. We would have been better served stopping at either location for a better quality Italian meal. \\n\\nMaybe I'm being a little harsh. Maybe something was up (new cook)? Maybe we should give it another try. But, to do so we'd have to pass all those other fine establishments in the North End and East Boston to get here again.\\n\\nIf we were back in the California desert and this was the only Italian Restaurant for miles in the valley. I guess we would eat here again. But we're not."},{"name":"Davidson's Casual Dining","address":"12830 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"Will never go back to this establishment.

Wow Excellent atmosphere which starts in the parking lot and continues throughout the restaurant.\\nSeveral Great Bars. We ate out on the patio although a rather cool night out in Orlando the patio was very warm and inviting. It was a Sunday the days taco special was excellent.

Usually Seaport is snobby, overpriced & uptight but the service and greeting at the door made me feel welcomed. The menus of 3$ Taco tuesday was phenomenal great value and quality. Margs were good not the greatest, not lolita like quality but still good for Boston. Our server was pretty busy and she killed it-- will be back on a Tuesyay soon enough"},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I was not very impressed with this place overall. The food was decent but overpriced. The Capesante scallop dish tasted good but the scallops in it were slightly overcooked. I also ordered the Ravioli alla Amatriciana for myself but was more blown away by partner's order of the Raviolone Aperto. The pasta in both were good, but outside of the sauce there wasn't much else that stood out to me when it came to the Ravioli alla Amatriciana. The Raviolone Aperto on the other hand, was pretty creamy and the seafood at the bottom of the open ravioli was very delicious. I would order that in a heartbeat if I ever came back. \\n\\nWhat dinged my rating of this place the most was the service. I didn't think the staff were very attentive to us while we were there. We barely were checked on and our server didn't stick around to allow us to ask questions. It was pretty crazy in the North End in general with a festival happening outside, but the restaurant itself is pretty small so there aren't a ton of people to tend to, to begin with. Outside of taking our order and the check I barely interacted with my waiter and when I did his focus seemed to be elsewhere. \\n\\nAs mentioned before, this place is on the smaller side so I'd suggest trying to get a seat closer to a wall rather than in the middle section. We sat in the middle and got bumped by people a few times due to the smaller space. \\n\\nThis is a decent date night spot but not very quiet. Depending on the type of occasion, you may want to look for something were you would have more privacy and hear less of the outside noise."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],j={key:0},D={key:1};function L(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(m,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(R,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-bddb80c5"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/31.md","filePath":"people/31.md"}'),q={name:"people/31.md"},Y=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
