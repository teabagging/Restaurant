My first few visits I had to speak to management immediately because the service was SO POOR.

The atmosphere just puts you at ease. Be careful, their website is not up to date, but they do offer Happy Hour Tuesday through Friday 3-6pm. They have 1/2 price draft beers and some finger food specials. They no longer have the $10 sandwiches that they have posted on their website. We both chose to have their saison noir. Normally $7 but at happy hour they are $3.50 a piece. Look at your receipt closely and you will see that the beers seem to ring up at $5 a piece but when you see the total at the bottom of the receipt it will seem that the math doesn't work out. I included a picture of our receipt so you could see an example. Ultimately the bartender assured me that our final total was correct and that the math just looks wrong due to a difficulty getting the computer program to ring up happy hour properly. I imagine that is a headache for him if his patrons actually look at their receipt when cashing out. We also tried their Adobo wings for $5 on their happy hour menu. They are Filipino marinated served with Korean pickles. The marinade is not heavy or overpowering, it is truly the proper touch of taste. I really enjoyed the flavor of the marinade. It was 4 wings. So we each had two. If you are hungry get an order for just yourself. Rockmill Tavern is a brewery you should experience at least once. The beauty of the atmosphere is worth it. During happy hour the beers are truly reasonably priced.

The driver was friendly, and the food was still hot. The thing that made me most hopeful about the meal ahead was the slice's crust - the texture of the outside was crisp, and the body of the slice was appropriately chewy. It was doughy (as one might expect from Sicilian), but not overly so. The toppings were fresh and tasty, with fresh shrooms and flavorful (but not super greasy) sausage crumbles being the big winners. \\n\\nThe wings were meaty, with crisp edges. I'd venture to say they would have been even more crisp had they been consumed on site (not sealed up to steam and soften on the way from the restaurant). The wings were accompanied by the requisite blue cheese and celery (both of which were happily wrapped separately from the hot items, in the bag with the tiramisu).\\n\\nThe tiramisu was just okay - definitely seemed homemade, which is a good thing, but missing the requisite cocoa powder. Oh, and it was semi-frozen in the middle... that was a less-than pleasant surprise.\\n\\nAll in all, not a horrible outing.

For those with visiting with friends, I would definitely recommend splitting one since it's pretty gigantic.\\n\\nOf course there's usually a line when quality desserts at a nice price point are around, but it moves fairly quickly.

If I may: It's not about the chicken.\\n\\nLet me re-phrase: It starts with the chicken. Hands down, it's some of the best in the city. It's the only Nashville-style in town, true enough. (Unless you know of another place, then TELL ME.) Simple, good, down-home cooking. They've revamped the recipes a little bit as they've gone along (the slaw is less peppery and the mac has benefitted from having new, uniformly-heating ovens to cook in) and added banana pudding as a consistent dessert option.\\n\\nThat's where my food review stops. Because HCT starts with fried chicken, yet it's so much more. The DeLoss' have made this business by investing in the community, working to hire and train people who need to establish a steady work history. This sounds very touchy-feely, but to put that idea into action, and to set your business model with the intention to grow your influence along with your revenue - that takes patience, care and balance.\\n\\nSo far, they've nailed it. From my first visit at the Near East Side Co-op (getting tickets to their previous pop-ups was the impossible dream for me), it felt like a family picnic. That's carried over to North Market. Joe is always greeting and meeting the line, working hard to remember faces and names and getting the HCT word out on the street, literally. My young niece (9) and nephew (5) think he's great (\\"He's the boss? He's SO NICE! I didn't know bosses were supposed to be nice!\\"), and Joe's genuine enjoyment shows through.\\n\\nOnce I'd experienced HCT (and maybe I had an out of body experience when I had my first holy dark meal), and when Joe told us the way they wanted to invest in community, I knew I'd been initiated into THE CULT OF HOT CHICKEN. It's super-fun to sit next to people who are there for the first time, and welcome them to the HCT community.\\n\\nIf you've not been to HCT, keep an eye out for their new food truck. They may also keep their North Market space going forward, if their plans to double their staff by April are any indication. HCT is proof positive that business can do ethical work in the community and be viable, even thrive.

Yeah, I know there have been pods downtown forever, but I never paid them any mind until they showed up on my side of the river.  Cartopia is still one of my favorite pods, especially when I can walk there on a warm summer's night (what?  It could happen).  \\n\\nEarly in the evening, it is \\"family friendly\\" with kids running around or playing with action figures along the lines of picnic tables, completely ignored by the parents, even when they invade your personal dining space.  Yeah, that kid lost his toy until I was done eating.  Don't worry - it magically reappeared before I left.  The Bud insisted.\\n\\nWay later in the evening, it is a waste(d) land of former bar patrons looking to get their gut bomb fill before managing to get themselves home and into bed.  In the beginning, this was the absolute worst time to come to the pods.  They were crowded, rowdy, and, well, gross.  Neighbor complaints were through the roof.  Seems to me it's less of a problem now, though that's subjective for sure.\\n\\nThere is a pleasant lull somewhere in the middle of the evening when the children are all gone, but the over-imbibers have not yet spilled out of the bars.

And uppity \\"foodies\\" would never step foot into this area of town to get this EXCEPTIONAL food.  I decided to try several things (they are, relative to ATL's usual costs, undeniably affordable).   I had ox tail with collard, brown chicken stew with brown beans and rice (everything seems to come with rice which is just OK.....not a rice fan here so not holding that against them one iota.  \\n\\nThe oxtail flavorings were absolutely wonderful.  But it isn't my cut of meat and gnawing around a bone for a morsel of meat with lots of fat isn't exactly healthy or fun to me...BUT it was wonderful and I gobbled up the rice and sauce along with those tidbits of meat.  Put that flavor on another cut of beef (even if it has to be stewed with ox tail for flavor and fine.....I'd be a huge fan.  Right now just a big fan.  The collards were just perfect.  I cook these myself but always go to extreme lengths to cut out center veins and the like cause they're bitter.  Not here by golly....they were slightly sweet and just perfect.\\n\\nI had the brown chicken stew with black beans and rice and the chicken was tender and just delectable.  Not sure what the spices were but it was wonderful.  The black beans were a bit dull (I'd have thrown in some garlic and bay leaves) but perhaps something dull to go with the overwhelming tastes of the other dishes is in order (You get two sides with an entr√©e).  \\n\\nThen I had the jerk chicken with cabbage which was steamed and lightly seasoned.  It was spicy....so some might not like it but I ate every bit.  Yum.  And the cabbage was good too.  Again with the sides (except the collards) I think a bit more spice might work better but these are minor MINOR complaints of a really picky eater (all the more reason to note the 5 stars).  \\n\\nThis is a gem in the middle of the airport region hell and a bit hard to find on Old National (hint it is behind a liquor store) Highway in College park but a perfect stop for someone returning from the airport and hungry on their way home.  And I know fools who will head from midtown to buckhead or perimeter to eat so this is better food, cheaper, and not much further. \\n\\nI had take out but from what I could tell staff was friendly and while the place looks like a bit of a dive (not a place for some prissy twit) it is respectable without any tacky attempt at some stupid carribean theme or other nonsense.  This is fantastic food at really cheap prices (all that food I ate was 26ish bucks).  Oh and this were the SMALL sizes too....god forbid you get the large size!!\\n\\nOverall this is just totally 5 stars for food.  3 for ambience (I don't give a shit about that) and I'm guessing 4-5 for service BUT they're so good they're busy.  They need angel investors and a spot downtown.....\\n\\nOh the pics below don't do the food justice AT ALL....the pics look gross and maybe the food isn't as attractive as it could be....but the taste.

I figure maybe their too busy cooking and smoking good Bar be que and do not have time to fix the sign. \\n\\nWe sit in the corner by the TV on the west side of the restaurant and get thrown some menu's. We decided to both order the Beef Brisket plate since the specials board says all full plates are 2 bucks off. I order my two sides of cole slaw and mashed potatoes with my meal.\\n\\nWhen it shows up I was immediately disappointed there are two strips of Brisket and one other was cut with the grain of the meet and looked in size and scope like a piece of weatherstripping. I take this particular piece first and notice it is lukewarm at best and dip it into the watery \\"Memphis style\\" sauce and it is so tough that I attempt to chew it and actually have to take it out of my mouth and put it on the small dish that is supporting the cole slaw side. \\n\\nBelieve me I was hungry and for me to abandon the bite was something I don't ever recall doing in a restaurant. The undersized two other pieces were a little better. The sides were okay, heavy use of pepper in the mashed potatoes and very watery cole slaw dressing.\\n\\nThe bill comes and the waitress did not discount the two bucks so I am holding a bill that came to $16.50 for a completely inedible meal with a coke. I decided that the two bucks that she kept was her tip. \\n\\nIf this place was in Tennessee or anywhere else in the South it would be perceived as a joke at best."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Yum!

I'm not from round here, so I thought Mike's was the place (and it's still good, don't get me wrong) but this place is better.

To address those points, I've eaten at Mike's twice, and I think they are doing such land office business that the pastry doesn't get much chance to get soggy. Also, the whipped cream is still good...and the fru-fru flavors...well, if you don't like them, don't get them. But they're there and some of them are good.\\n\\nBut to actually talk about Modern - they're better. On every level, it's a notch up from Mike's. We went quasi \\"brand blind\\" and compared pistachio cannoli head to head, and Modern had better pasty and a creamier, richer, and more substantial filling, without as much sweetness when compared to Mike's.

They offer a full bar open until midnight with a menu consisting of traditional pub food items.  They are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \\n\\nMy visit to Common Ground yesterday was not my first.  I have been a few times and on most occasions have sat at the bar for a drink with friends.  I find my experiences here to be just okay. It's a convenient place to meet local friends for a casual night out, but if it was not so close to home I probably would not consider it as an option.  The atmosphere is somewhat trendy with a long bar stretching the room's length and some pub tables are nearby.  A divider offers a bit more privacy for diners wishing to sit some distance from the bar with a selection of booths or tables on that side of the restaurant. \\n\\nThe service at Common Ground yesterday was very disappointing.  I met a prior co-worker for lunch to chat and catch up. It was a beautiful summer day so we decided to take advantage of the outdoor seating. We were acknowledged by a waitress who told us she would \\"be right with us.\\"  We waited... and the waitress continued to go about her business serving tables as we stood there. We thought she had gone to find help for us.  More waiting ... and finally we had to remind the waitress we were there. She acted as if she had completely forgotten about us and went to find someone to help us. A man finally came over with menus, but he seemed stressed and was not very welcoming. We received no apologies for our wait. My friend was worried about sitting at a table with direct sun so she asked the guy for a table with an umbrella. Only problem is the last remaining umbrella table belonged to the restaurant next door. They are separated by a chain, but she did not see it. The guy seating us proceeded to pick up the menus he was placing on the table and said \\"That's the restaurant next door so you will need to go over there.\\" We quickly stopped him and said no this is fine and he placed the menus back down.  I thought this was such rude and condescending behavior. All he needed to say was \\"Im sorry. That is not our table.\\"  I could not even understand why he would attempt to send us away to another restaurant. We had just waited very patiently for a seat too without making a single complaint. Once we were seated, water was delivered to our table from 3 different servers. We had to laugh at this point and noted how we went from no service to a little too much. I am not sure they have worked out a smooth flow for the outdoor seating service or maybe it was just an off day.  These tables have been on the sidewalk all summer, however, so they really should have it figured out by now. \\n\\nMy prior experiences here were okay and they do have a great beer list.

Consider this review in memoriam unless, of course, the restaurant re-opens under new ownership/management.\\n\\nStrip was one of a handful of restaurants that opened with Atlantic Station in October 2005. In restaurant years, it stood the test of time. Up until its final months of operation, business appeared to still be going strong and the place continued to be a popular spot for both lunch and dinner, particularly on weekends.\\n\\nThe restaurant had multiple levels. Its two patios (ground level and second level) were next to and overlooked Atlantic Station's Central Park, the green space in the center of the retail district. In the evenings and on weekends, the patios was often buzzing with activity. These were arguably the best patios in Atlantic Station. There was a third level rooftop deck too.\\n\\nStrip was a trendy spot that exuded somewhat of a club/lounge type atmosphere at night. After about a decade in existence, the place had held up well. It still looked nice and sleek. Along with the patios, there were multiple bars and different spaces which could be used for private functions.\\n\\nI attended two private events here and had a good time at each. One of the events took place in a private room on the first floor. Strip set up a small self-serve buffet with chickpea hummus with grilled pita bread and mixed olives, grilled vegetable antipasto (e.g. artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions), a \\"domestic cheese\\" platter with four different types of cheeses/spreads and toast, spinach-jack cheese dip with white corn tortilla chips, and teriyaki steak kabobs with grilled steak and assorted veggies. There was an open bar with drink orders taken by servers.\\n\\nAnother event took place at the second floor bar and open-air patio, which faces Atlantic Station's Central Park. We also had access to the third level, the sky bar/lounge. This event was for the lighting of the Atlantic Station Christmas tree. Strip's 2nd floor patio provided a great view and we were kept warm thanks to several gas-fired heat lamps. Just like the first event, there was a self-serve bar of food and an open bar. I liked the food better at the Christmas tree lighting event because there was sushi -- rolls, nigiri, and even sashimi. How generous. The desserts were better too, with delicious cheesecakes and cobbler pies.\\n\\nGenerally, these buffet-style foods were okay. The ingredients were fresh, though no particular item stood out. It's your typical, sort of generic and formulaic, mass produced, \\"chainy\\" catered convention food. The cheeses were cut into unusually large and awkward cubes. Several of the aforementioned dishes could be ordered off the normal menu including the hummus, spinach dip, and steak kabobs.\\n\\nService was good.

We were seated with a breath taking view of the hoochie (the river). It had the brood in awe of magnificent scenic beauty. It seems like nature is the only thing the brood can't manipulate. I came for dinner a week ago and gave 4 stars, i came today for brunch and my mind was blown! 5 stars no doubt about it. The food is presented in an appealing array of where the hell should I start first?!! Yes... it looks that good. I made it my mission to try everything, I couldn't do it. Damn life is full of so many regrets! It's a large spread that is sumptuous indeed! The red velvet waffles ARE WHAT RED VELVET SHOULD TASTE LIKE! spot on, and cheers to whomever prepared them. Of course we all over dosed in hog heaven, bacon.. GLORIOUS MOUNDS OF CRISP BACON! The plump, juicy, mushrooms stuffed with crab to the cheesy mac n cheese will have you up there for 2nds & 3rds. The shrimp scampi rice was unique, very flavorful, and loaded with shrimp. The chicken pot pie..... jesus christ on a bicycle, it was devine! You wouldve thought RAY put someones nana to work in the kitchen. The lettuce for the salads were crisp and fresh, the stone crab claws and the peel & shrimp outstanding. Don't get me raving about the gumbo and the tomato bisque!! I would've walked across hot coals for both. If you love a good bisque and tomatoes, it like swallowing an orgasm from a soup spoon. It's seasoned to perfection with the right amount of heat to it. I don't care for gumbo at all, but I tried a cup and RAYS will be the only gumbo I eat in GA. What I liked most is my ol man and I ordered these soups as appetizers when we came for dinner a week ago, STILL TASTED THE SAME. Consistency is very important to patrons, at least it is for me. I fell in love with the bisque last week and it tasted the exact same today. The omelet station was organized and 5-6 people could be served at a time. Toppings galore for the omelets from shrimp to spinach and anything your heart desired. The carving station was delectable as well as the sliced meats on the buffet. The desserts were red velvet cupcakes, banana pudding, chocolate chip cookies, 2 types of mousse, apple cobbler, and carrot cake cup cakes. There were more desserts like chocolate cake and coconut cake, i didnt have room to try those. I didn't care for the banana pudding but I was informed by my ol man that's what \\"real\\" banana pudding tastes like. it's not that jello instant banana flavor pudding folks. It's the real deal. Brunch for 2 was totally worth $95 smackeroo's!!! Children 5 and under are free, $17 over the the age of 5. Brunch includes all you can eat with a soft drink. The bottomless mimosas are $12 but can't be served until 1230pm, thank that goodie 2 shoes who passed that serving law for sundays. I saw plenty of people order it as soon as the time approached lol  Rays is totally worth checking out, I will diffinitely be back. Our wait staff was incredibly attentive, engaging, friendly, fast, accomodating, etc etc our waiter John and the team that assisted him went above and beyond! I was very satisfied with our experience from beginning to end. Bravo Ray's staff...bravo!! Now... my last little remark, those who have complained about service here, my ol man personally witnessed an older african american lady give the omelet station cook (whom was an African American female) a hard time and make her job difficult on top of serving other patrons. This woman was a public nuisance and it makes me wonder how many of these people who wrote reviews complaining about service was just as obnoxious as this hard to please old bitty he observed. I'm sorry but I couldn't complain on anything if someone offered me a $1000 to, that's how great the food and the brunch experience was.

The best part of my meal is that the fish was blackened and still moist but completely cooked through and not fishy. The rice and beans on the side were very tasty as well.

Together we must unite to ensure that this perfection is not bound to the October season. This small Whoopie pie is truly a unique perfection. There are three conceptual components to a Whoopie pie. The cake \\"bun\\" which consists of an outside and inside component and the filling that lies between the top and bottom \\"bun\\". Let's break down the perfection of the Petsi Pumpkin Whoopie Pie and if you aren't screaming to Sommerville by the end, you are dead inside. \\n\\nThe outer component of the \\"bun\\" is firm and resists your bite just ever so slightly. This forms a convenient feel to the bite, but also provides a very effective means of ensuring your fingers stay clean while holding it. \\nMany other Whoopie pies outside layer fails to keep the cake crumbs from sticking to your fingers. The cake inside parts is not to thick (most standard Whoopie pies are IMHO) and perfectly moist and pumpkin flavored. I would swear there were palpable tiny jewels of sweet pumpkin pie nestled in the little caverns of the cake. Once your bite breaks completely through the bun parts; there lies the true secret of this pie's power. The cream cheese frosting. Yes! What a brilliance of design. The Carrot cake secret fuses with Pumpkin and smacks down the Whoopie pie. A standard Whoopie pie just has to give it up now, no whipped like frosting wannabe can compete.

Those 40 spices would be really enhanced by adding the right amount of salt. On Masterchef (the tv show) you can be sent home for forgetting to properly salt your dish! The food was fine but nothing special. Some people at our table felt their dish was overpriced for the amount of food they recieved. \\n\\nAlas the refried beans were more like purreed black beans.

The refried beans is one of my favourite parts of good Mexican food so I was pretty disappointed with the two tablespoons of soupy black beans I was served.\\n\\nI'd say it's a good place for a light lunch since the portions are small.

The food was brought relatively fast given the amount of people in the restaurant. The dish was a colorful mixture of reds and oranges that expelled a delicious odor accented with spices and roasted tomatoes. I was hoping the dish didn't disappoint, like my previous experience. I dove in. The pasta in combination with the meats and the vegetables resulted in a mouthwatering experience. The flavor was there, no doubt about it. The pasta was perfectly cooked. The tomatoes were bright and complemented the meats well. Both, the shrimp and chicken went very well together, despite how weird the combination may seem.\\nAs we ate, the waitress would stop by and ask how the dishes were and was constantly refilling our drinks. My only complaint was that the dish was a bit too greasy, I understand that the saut√© everything on the same pan and put everything on the plate; however, the food would have been much easier to eat if I hadn't had to carefully take the pasta from my plate up to my mouth as I was afraid the dripping grease would stain my clothes. \\nOverall it was a fantastic 4-star dining experience with good food, great atmosphere, and fantastic service."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"This is the perfect to take guests.

I had heard about HCT from a co-worker who went to the OTE location and complimented on how much she liked it. When we arrived at the North Market and saw a line snaked around the room, we knew we had a half hour wait for something special.\\n\\nI ordered the boneless chicken breast (Warm) meal which came with Ma's Mac, Ma's Slaw and pickles. Bread normally comes with the meal, but I choose the waffle option instead. Just to make sure I was stuffed, I also got a side of dark meat (thigh/leg) which also came with bread and the banana pudding for dessert.\\n\\nThe chicken breast was large, deliciously moist and the warm heat sauce on the skin was the perfect amount of heat for me; it made my nose run, had great taste (not just hot for the sake of hot) and didn't linger on the palate too long. The all-you-can-drink sweet tea was perfect for washing away what little eat might be left over to get me ready for another bite.\\n\\nThe slaw was very fresh with crisp cabbage and a tangy vinegar dressing that was tasty. While I prefer a creamy slaw dressing, the vinegar dressing was very good.\\n\\nThe mac and cheese was probably the let down of the meal. There was plenty and it was good - but there was just something missing. For me a little more salt might have helped, but what I think was missing was a big cheese flavor. With powerful flavors like the heat from the chicken and the vinegar from the slaw - the mac got lost in the meal. It needs something to be able to stand up to the other two and make this a solid 3-point meal.\\n\\nThe banana pudding - OH THE PUDDING. I'm not going to lie - I would knock down your mother to get to more of this pudding. Made with real bananas and topped with whipped cream and crumbled vanilla wafers it was delicious. To rip off The Oatmeal; it gave me mouth-boners.\\n\\nBig hint; the house made ranch is perfect on the chicken if you want to cut off a little bit of the heat!\\n\\nThere price here is a little steep - this isn't a cheap lunch. But you're not only buying a good meal, but you're supporting real people (not a corporation) and if you've read anything about the owner - he's all about community and giving back. If you're only there to buy chicken you might be a little sticker shocked, but if you look at your purchase as an investment in a person, a family and a community - the price isn't bad at all.\\n\\nThere really wasn't a down side to this meal; except for the passable but forgettable mac and cheese. I won't review the service because it was opening weekend and they were slammed from the time we got there until we left. But for the amount of people who were there and the amount of food they were pushing out - the service was fine; no complaints. The only thing that I noticed is that there were a fair number of meals going back to the kitchen to be corrected. We sat at the table closest to where the food was coming out so we were able to overhear come of the guests conversations. It seemed that most of the meals were going back because the right combo wasn't there; e.g. they ordered double mac and only got single, they ordered a waffle and only got bread, etc. All of this can easily be fixed and didn't effect my review at all. I chalk it up to opening day wrinkles and growing pains that I'm sure they will work out quickly."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is legendary but a total tourist trap.

Iced coffee is my drink as much for the fun of making it at the table as for the lightning bolt of sweetened caffeine it delivers.  My wife enjoys a tall glass of Salty Lemonade, yep, salty lemondade, which she highly recommends for its \\"cool weird flavor\\".  It's interesting, but I'll stick with my super-coffee.  For dessert, I like the sweetened iced beans (mung beans, kidney beans, sweetened coconut milk, one variation adds green jello too).  Sweetened beans might sound weird, but they really work with the other ingredients.  You will take a bite, will marvel that sweet beans actually taste good, and then will want to share your discovery with the table.

Some of the reviews I've read may be due to the April 1st (2016) opening, but as of today (August 20th), they were a nonissue:\\n\\n* Beer: She got the cucumber beer, and raved about it all night. I tried it... meh... a LOT of cucumber flavor. But that's what she wanted, and she loved it. I got the Nightmare on Ponce (just awaiting the lawsuit from 3 Taverns), and while it was good, it was more of a hoppy porter than a black IPA, but she loves porters and thought it was awesome\\n\\n* Service: We got there about 8:30 on a Friday night and were seated right away. The waitress didn't offer upstairs (dining) or down (bocce, bar games, etc...), but that's probably because it seems the downstairs are all 6 person tables plus. Our waitress was on her 4th night, but she did an amazing job, we both agreed on\\n\\n* Food: She got the Shrimp Bo-urger - it's essentially diced shrimp formed into a patty, lightly breaded, and deep fried. She thought it was amazing, I felt the shrimp steaming inside the patty made the shrimp taste too strong. I had the T.H.C. sandwich - a MASSIVE chicken breast (Nashville Hot style) on a Ciabatta roll with spicy mayo, tomato, slaw, pickles... If this sandwich is not in Heaven, I don't know that's where I want to be. I can't say that she'd bypass Heaven for the sandwich, but she really liked it. Her side was the slaw, mine was brussels sprouts. The slaw was amazing, the sprouts were over cooked for both our liking, but good.\\n\\nOverall, 4 stars. The portions were good sized - an appetizer was not needed (in fact I could not finish my T.H.C. sandwich).  Some people say it's \\"slightly better bar food\\" - I could not disagree more.

What, wrong relative? Who cares! \\n\\nI was nervous about this place since it was so hyped. I feared it would disappoint, but it didn't! I went for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. The place was busier than I expected, but not packed. I was seated immediately at a nice little table in the window. The place is decorated much like I imagine someone's mother's place would be... not MY mother, but someone's. The seating in the window is on built-in benches with cushions and throw pillows.\\n\\nI order coffee (drip, not french press) a cup of fruit and a scrambled egg dish. The coffee was good. I thought at $5 the fruit cup was expensive, but I was trying to be healthy so I ordered it anyway. Then I got it! It was actually in a medium-sized bowl and was full of a variety of fresh, juicy fruit. A couple at a table near me each got a \\"bowl\\" of fruit and they were HUGE! The egg dish was also very good. The weak point of the meal was the potatoes. There was nothing really wrong with them, but they didn't stand out as being particularly flavorful. Maybe some ketchup would have livened them up.\\n\\nThe service was good and attentive. The waitress thoughtfully asked if I wanted the fruit brought out first (I said yes) and my water and coffee were refilled promptly.\\n\\nAll in all, very nice.

Let me preface this by saying that I completely understand a restaurant needs 1-3 months to work out all the kinks, so i'm not judging too hard.  Overall the experience was fantastic.\\n\\nLet me break it down..\\n\\nService - Something to be expected that while the service was friendly, it was a bit disorganized.  This could be mainly due to the fact that we were sitting at a 6 person high top and they split it 2x2, so they kept asking us if we ordered a dish that was actually for the other side of the table. No biggie, everything else came out pretty fast\\n\\nBar - At first I was dissapointed because  the Bangkok surprise s was flat out unavailable and it  looked like it was the best on the menu. Instead we ordered the Haumea which was good, but I'm not a huge fan of cava.  When we got to a table, we ordered the $20 scorpion bowl which was terrific, came out flaming for a good 5 mins and was potent yet delicious, great value.  Also i'm happy to see that they have RicherPour wine on the menu, their wine on tap is great!\\n\\nVibe - Really interesting look and feel, kinda like Myers and Chang and sorta funky.  The music was like top 90s which was a bit odd, but i like the decor.\\n\\nPrice - Pretty reasonable $70 between the two of us\\n\\nFood - We ordered a ton of stuff, I was impressed with alot of the offerings, the \\nonly negative was the \\"snack\\" Japanese potatoto chips (10 measly chips with sour cream and onion dip) - are you kidding me? They should just give put this out on the table for free because its not even a snack. Our waiter realized we burned through the chips with a ton of dip left and gave us 5 more chips...Fix the portions!\\n\\nKale salad - Absolutely terrific, nice flavors and love squash in my salad\\n\\nShrimp Sumai - nothing special but nice flavors\\n\\nDan Dan noodles - WAYY too salty and oily, I could do without it.\\n\\nIndonesian curried lamb shepards pie - OUTSTANDING, love it! Wish it was an entree because i could eat this all day\\n\\nKorean chicken wings - Really delicious, piping hot and crunchy, chicken was delicious.  Drumbsticks were better than the wings that had no meat.  The kimchi slaw was also really delicious.\\n\\n\\nOverall - Great addition to Fort Point.

I love their drink menu, they have 6 different old fashioned and about 6 more custom cocktails as well as a full bar and decent wine list. The food menu looked awesome, especially the milkshakes and desserts. We just needed something to counteract the alcohol so we grabbed an order of the spinach and artichoke dip rolls and the chocolate bread. The egg rolls were served in a crispy shell alongside fontina cheese dip, they were really good and a awesome spin on the more familiar dip version of the appetizer. The bread was a chocolate almond bread served warm with salted caramel butter. It has actual melts morsels of chocolate and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, it was perfect almost like a pumpernickel.

Next the Mongolian beef and the Mandarin chicken came out. I've tried Mongolian beef at many different Chinese restaurants and they were all fairly decent, but i found the Mongolian beef here to be tastier. With the Mongolian beef, it usually comes with fried rice noodles and at certain restaurants they'll bring it out to you soggy with the beef but here it rice noodles were crunchy and tasty, and the beef was well sauced and cooked, very  delicious.

I had an Ashley Vineyard Pinot with my steak that suited it perfectly. My girlfriend had a beer flight and we split an ice wine (sweet dessert wine) flight as well. Everything was tasty. \\n\\nAmbiance of the restaurant was key.  It is fairly small in a wooded wine cellar. It is low lit and a great spot for a date. Wonderful spot to escape the hustle and bustle of the World Showcase on a crowded day. \\n\\nYou'll like Le Cellier...truly one of the overall best meal experiences you can find at Walt Disney World."},{"name":"Green Lettuce Indian Style Chinese Restaurant","address":"1949 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Was craving for spicy Indian Chinese food.

Street parking wasn't tough to find although admittedly we were there for a rather late lunch.  Seating was available on two stools at a counter indoors, and 3 two tops set out on along the sidewalk.\\n\\nOne of the owners was handling the register, and he took great care of me and my order.  He was real welcoming and friendly.  He showed me the size of their ciabatta rolls when I asked how big their po boys were, and gave me no trouble when I inquired about ordering a sub with both oysters and shrimp.  I also caught eye of him washing his hands several times between tasks.\\n\\nTurns out all their po boys are made with their special spicy remoulade, lettuce, tomato, and the protein of choice.  He offered to make it mild for me when I inquired about the spiciness.  It still had a kick, but I managed quite well.\\n\\nThe combo sandwich ended up being one half stuffed with fat fried oysters and the other half rather good sized shrimp.  The shrimp numbered 3 or 4, while the oysters were tougher to count.  So, if you are sharing, you can either chomp half of your half, then switch off with your lunch mate, or trade some of the contents with one another before you begin, depending on just how close you are with your dining companion.\\n\\nWe were treated to some onion rings ($3.79) which were light and flakey - just great! - although they did leave an oily residue on my fingers.  Ketchup was available at the counter in a squeeze bottle.\\n\\nNo table service here, but food was served on real plates for those dining in, and we were trusted to pay later.\\n\\nSounds like they may have begun having hours on Saturdays - so if you are interested, call and ask.

It's been over 8 months and I finally found my new favorite restaurant. Prior to my dinner at Bia Bistro I hadn't eaten anywhere locally where I thought \\"I have to come back here\\".  (Well, I do like Wild Ginger for take-out Thai but that's a different type of scene).\\n\\nI enjoyed the atmosphere inside. We sat at a high-top 2-top table near the bar which was more enjoyable than being in the back dining room, if you ask me. For starters, our waitress was terrific. I forget her name but she had an Irish brogue and she made some excellent recommendations regarding both wine and menu.\\n\\nMy husband and I were each interested in a different wine so we opted for glasses instead of sharing a bottle.  She brought them both over to the table for us to taste and then gave us very generous pours.  \\n\\nThe menu here is interesting.  They have starters, bar portions, half portions and entrees so we had to ask about what the sizes meant. Our waitress was very helpful in saying things like \\"the full  meal has 6 scallops while the half portion has 3\\". Not that I needed to know exactly what amount of food I'd be getting but since it was our first time we wanted to make sure we ordered enough, but not too much.  \\n\\nWith so many choices we opted  for sharing a few smaller plates. We each started with a lobster stuffed oyster. (You could order them individually, which was nice). It was okay but probably the least memorable thing we ate all night. The \\"lobster\\" part of the stuffing was barely identifiable.  Then we split the anti pasto which was very good, but not at all what we expected. It was more like a green salad with some cheeses & meats. I didn't expect all of the green, but I enjoyed it.   During this time we also enjoyed warm, homemade bread dipped in a mixture of good quality oil and vinegar.\\n\\nOur next dishes were the highlights of the evening. We shared small plates of the the penne Bolognese and the short rib (which arrived on a bed of mashed potatoes with sliced carrots and asparagus). The short rib was melt in your mouth tender, and delicious. The Bolognese was wonderful too - a perfect blend of spicy, acidic tomato with just a hint of cream. It's a pretty basic dish but done right, it's delicious. \\n\\nWe ordered on the heavier side because it was a chilly night, but I'm looking forward to going back and trying the spicy seafood stew and the scallops next time. \\n\\nThis place was a great combination of atmosphere, food, wine and service. It all worked."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"If you are craving some lobster or crab legs, then this is the place to go.

The hotel, the rental car, the food, activities, etc. \\n\\nNaturally, my first thought was \\"What do I eat when I get off the plane\\" and I turned to Yelp to provide trusted suggestions about areas to check out. Not knowing anything about the area, Taqueria Don Mario made it in the final 3 dinner stops. \\n\\nNow, there was a huge disconnect in my plan - primarily, the unexpected Long Island during my 35 minute layover in Vegas (Who knew I could drink a long island that quickly), and the extra cocktail on the plane. \\n\\nOnce we landed, it was off to get our rental car and get some mexican food. or so I thought. after driving around (for reasons unknown to my self) for what felt like eternity, we decided to ixnay the plans for dinner and resort to the first place we saw open - Whataburger. \\n\\nFast forward to Saturday. Feeling like an adventure with my dad, my sister and I ventured off to find Taqueria Don Mario. It was a bit of an adventure, but we finally found it, and it wasn't what I expected. As a matter of fact, we almost ate at the mexican restaurant across the street, but I convinced my dad and sister to eat at Don Marios.\\n\\nFirst, this is definitely a \\"hole in the wall joint\\" but it's one that I would visit again and a again. The interior is clean, just a bit on the \\"informal\\" side.\\n\\nService was, most of the time, above average. The only long wait we experienced was bringing the food to our table - but things were crazy for them. They had a sudden rush of customers show up about 5 - 10 minutes after we did.\\n\\nMy dad, who likes to drink beer with his dinner, was a bit disappointed when they didn't serve beer. Since I was footing the bill, you could imagine I was glad. However, the waitress kindly informed us that it is \\"BYOB\\" - so my dad went to the liquor store two or three doors down, bought a 16 pack of beer, and continued on with his evening.\\n\\nNow, for the important part - the food.\\n\\nThe waitress talked us - well me - into loaded queso dip. Normally, I don't eat queso. All I see is velveta, and I can't stand it. But, I figured what the hell. My dad bought queso at another mexican restaurant the other day, I figured he'd like it, so I ordered it.\\n\\nThey also had a salsa bar, which had this green spicy guacamole in it. I haven't been able to work my self up to eating guacamole, but apparently this stuff has a good kick to it, and it's delicious, or so my sister says. \\n\\nI ordered three mini tacos (Al Pastor, Chorizo, and Bistec). My sister ordered the Tradicional. I forget what my dad ordered - but it was one of the specials.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the food delivery was a bit slow, but nothing horrible.\\n\\nThe food was fantastic. I enjoyed all three of the mini tacos. The refried beans were unreal!! I have never tasted beans that tasted like this! The rice was good as well.\\n\\nMy sister said her dish was great as well.\\n\\nMy dad, said it was OK. But, I tend to believe he was acting like a little baby and didn't want to admit that this was a million times better then any mexican food he has had.\\n\\nBeing a typical american, I expect large portions and a cheap price. \\n\\nI think that the plates should have been priced about 1 - 2 dollars less, or they need to include a *little* more food. The value was good, but it just felt weird paying that much for that little - or maybe it was because I wanted more.\\n\\nFor the three of us, the tab was around $32.00.\\n\\nIt was great food, reasonable portions/cost, alcohol is not served but is BYOB, great friendly service.\\n\\nNothing else to add."},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4015 Townsfair Way","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"People who know this place come all the time.

I've heard \\"Austin's best Italian\\" or \\"phenomenal service and quality of food\\" attributed to this place, and I thought if I wanted to blow my budget on a great experience, I should try Vespaio.\\n\\nTwo friends and I arrived at 6:00 PM this past Friday.  There was no wait for a table, except the maitre'd was not present and we had to wait a few moments for her to seat us.\\n\\nThe person waiting on us was Annie.  She didn't introduce herself, I had to gather her name from the receipt.  We were waiting quite a while to have our orders taken, and we weren't asked if had any questions about the menu.  After about 10 minutes of waiting, our fresh bread arrived accompanied by a extremely cold and unspreadable cannelloni bean paste that I don't have an acquired taste for.  Call me uncouth, but an olive oil dip would have been sufficient.  \\n\\nI have no problem spending a good dollar on food, but when we tried to order their small plate appetizers, Annie was not helpful with explaining to us how they work.  It was discouraging and frustrating, actually, and we ended up not choosing any appetizer at all.\\n\\nI ordered a caesar salad with dressing that seemed more healthy than flavorful.  The parmesan that topped the salad was young and didn't have much flavor to it.  I prefer more more aged, sharper cheese.  I do give them kudos though on using real anchovies for the salad.\\n\\nI ordered a spaghetti plate, and I was not impressed.  The pasta was fresh, but rather chewy.  The portion wasn't all that significant, and I was left with much more to be desired.  I would have expected more from a place that charges as much as it does.\\n\\nI also was unimpressed by their wine list.\\n\\nI'll go ahead and say that I'm an epicurean snob.  I'm not a high roller, but I do think I have a good idea of what a good kitchen and wait staff should consist of.  Vespaio missed the mark on both of these.  I've received far better service and quality of food at less expensive places like Andiamo.  \\n\\nI didn't appreciate the service we received.  Perhaps it was b/c we weren't part of the geriatric Luby's crowd that was there at 6 PM, nor did we represent the South Congress hipster posers (where fugly bohemian chic seems to be the new black) that littered the bar area.  Regardless, we did NOT feel welcome and Annie seemed to care less whether we were there or not.  I was extremely compelled to not leave a tip.  Tacky?  Yes.  But so was the apathetic attitude of the restaurant.\\n\\nOh, and a popular Austin restaurant that does not take reservations?  I'm removing a star.  You've got some balls for thinking that you can run a restaurant like a club."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Living near Orlando my wife and I, have been to the parks (with and without our kids) plenty of times.  We have even dined in and around the parks over the years with varied results.  In fact, we have dined quite a bit in and around Univeral Orlando Resorts to quite a bit of varied results, but for the most part, mostly good.  Taking this into consideration, I can unequivocally say this is probably the best themed restaurant in the Orlando area, hands down.  Some will probably balk at that statement, but I can't think of anyone better.\\n\\nToothsome is a steampunk themed restaurant, chocolate factory, and milkshake/ice cream shop all rolled into one really impressive package.  The chocolate factory and milkshake store are provided as the foyer to the restaurant, and the restaurant itself is two stories.  On our first trip, we enjoyed a small taste of their chocolates after an estimated wait of 40-minutes that was spot on.  The menu is to an extent, overwhelming, but our waitress was more than willing and patient with our endless questions.  In the end, we all agreed to order something off the menu and then share it amongst each other - it was an idea that staff themselves dropped by our table to laud.   \\n\\nThe food was absolutely fabulous - from the gnocchi's to the seafood pasta, to the grilled chicken, and to the meatloaf (which was by far everyone's favorite.  And that selection off the menu is not even the tip of the iceberg of what they offer.  For desserts, my wife and I shared the flourless chocolate cake and chocolate creme brulee, while my daughter and her roommate each had one of their specialty shakes that are too massive (and come in plastic cups you can keep!)\\n\\nThe reason why I only gave it four stars?  (Someone might wonder.)  Well, this was the soft opening and not all the restrooms were in working order.  This was bad news for the ladies in the group.  And my wife's dessert left a little to be desired.  Both items are really nits and we are without question looking forward to a return trip.

My friend finally requested an actual table since a few were free, and it took over 15 minutes for someone to eat us. The server's chose to clear tables before asking us what we wanted to drink. \\nThe beer selection was very minimal so i opted for an overpriced gastown cocktail. A buck gin special with cucumber and ginger beer. All 5 sips of it were delicious but it was over powered by HUGE ice cubes. When i pay $10 plus taxes for a drink, i want more then 5 sips. \\nThe friend who dragged me here as well said the food sucks, but it seems that everyone else on here disagrees so now i am a little disappointed we didn't try something there. \\nI love the huge windows, brick, design and lay out.

My boyfriend got a corned beef sandwich which came with awesome potato salad also, so maybe that'll make the list next time. \\n\\nThe lost star is for the ok service (a little slow every time I've been here) and the prices being just a little higher than I'd like. Also they make their latkes with food processed potatoes instead of grated, and they're much less crispy than I'd like, but perhaps that's an ideological difference. \\n\\nAs a disclaimer, I would probably never get anything here that I couldn't get at a brunch or american place closer to where I live- getting a burger or omelette wouldn't make any sense and would probably make me think it wasn't worth the price.

There was also a specials menu, which included a few items told to us and not printed.  Our group ordered the Eggs Benedict, the Southwest Scramble, and Sweet Potato pancakes.  All of these things were delicious.  The portions were big enough that a couple to-go boxes were taken.  My daughter's pancake (from the kids menu) was shaped like a mouse with a round face and big round ears, with banana and chocolate chip eyes.

My only critiques were the so so eclectic band they had playing, and the fact that they teased me with some outstanding nitrogen cut stout beer (locally made), just to tell me they sold out and the tester mug was all they could squeeze out.

Boston Lobster Feast was one of those times.  This dining \\"experience\\" was truly horrifying and I had to pinch myself a couple of times to make sure it was actually happening.  \\n\\nLet me give full disclosure and say coming to BLF was NOT my choice, but a terrible decision made by my boss while on a business trip.  The worst part of the experience was that we passed MULTIPLE great restaurants on the ride to the restaurant from the Orlando Hilton.  Immediately upon walking in the door I was hit with the disconcerting smell of seafood that just didn't smell right and then when I saw the buffet line, which was straight out of 1987, my worst fears were confirmed.  There was almost nothing edible on the buffet line besides some fried clams and hush puppies because, well it's REALLY hard to mess up anything friend to oblivion.  BLF did, however, manage to mess up fried catfish AND chicken fingers....how is that possible????  They have \\"sushi\\" on the buffet but I've had much better sushi from the $15 sushi buffet in my hometown.\\n\\nAfter a less than satisfying meal experience I went to the dessert table because you can't mess that up....right?  WRONG.  They could have bought better deserts from Sams or Costo and brought them in, but these \\"desserts\\" were miniscule at best and the \\"rice krispie treats\\" were hard as a rock.  \\n\\nAbout an hour after I walked in the door my BLF dining experience was mercifully over and we walked by tourists taking pictures of the buffet (not lying) and my coworkers and I got in the car and comiserated about spending $55 on our meal.  Bottom line, for $55 you can get a better meal almost anywhere on the I-Drive Strip.

Crowded (perhaps this will wear off), not enough room to maneuver, over priced, and not really all that much selection.  With an HEB less than a quarter of a mile away, there's virtually no reason to use Whole Foods in Bee Cave for anything other than trying to find a few speciality things that HEB doesn't have.  \\n\\nIt will come as no surprise to readers that the prices are too high.  For example: their deli meats case has nice deli turkey for $12 to $15 per pound.  You can get Boar's Head brand at HEB (best I've ever had) for $10 per pound, and if you want the HEB brand or (Heaven forfend) pre-sliced from Oscar Meyer or Hillshire Farms, you can get those for $5 to $8 per pound.  What you may not get is a label saying that the meat is 'sustainably farmed' or 'cruelty free' or whatever, but I'm not willing to pay 20% to 50% more to feel good about myself.  \\n\\nI do have to give an Honorable Mention for the Most Sanctimoniously Named Product at Whole Foods: a line of plastic bags (think garbage bags and zip-loc bags) called: \\"If You Care\\".  They're Compostable!  So, if I buy the Kirkland bags at Costco, I am (much?) less morally virtuous than someone who \\"cares\\" enough to pay probably four times the going rate to get these bags at Whole Foods.

Whole Foods Bee Cave certainly does not have that problem.  It's just not that big, doesn't really have all that much stuff, and really isn't very impressive.\\n\\nThe wine selection is actually pretty paltry, as is the beer selection.  There is a big Twin Liquors about 100 yards away, so go there for a far better selection and better pricing.  \\n\\nWe had our two little kids with us, so we did not try the bar upstairs, so maybe that's cool, but hardly enough of a draw to make us come back there very often.  One point about the kids...  you know the deal with those little shopping carts they got?  Well even the 'full size' ones are small and have a very small 'seat' area for one child.  Bigger kids won't fit comfortably (HEB has room for two big kids - awesome).  \\n\\nOne last good thing.

Definitely recommend trying it out if you love crawfish, crabs and that kind of seafood, but definitely not worth 4 stars. \\n\\nCheers,\\nJack"},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great place.

I was headed towards the other counter to get a cannoli, but was distracted by the fluffy and delicious LOOKING cupcakes. My bf and I were very disappointed. We saw so many people walking across the city with boxes from Mike's Pastry that we were determined to see what all the hype was about. We definitely should have stuck to buying a cannoli! The cupcakes were dry and simply mediocre. He was very disappointed with the red velvet cupcake because the frosting tasted nothing like cream cheese and everybody knows red velvet cupcakes are made with cream cheese frosting! \\n\\nI believe it was like $1.50 for each cupcake. Price was normal for a cupcake in this cupcake craze. We were just hoping for a bite of heaven.\\n\\nNow the cannoli was heaven.

Actually it may be the worst, period! My wife and I had to fly into Boulder for a family emergency, and unfortunately the pickings were slim at that time. So we booked a room through a booking agency and got a confirmation for about $ 225 a night. Since we would be arriving very late, I contacted the hotel directly to make sure the front desk would be open. I then casually asked what the room rate would be if I booked directly. I was quoted $ 389 a night. ????. Anyway we got there and got in. We were in the older \\"non renovated\\" section which meant stained and worn carpeting in the hallways, together with peeled  and buckled wallpaper. Oh, and as so many revierers have noted, the elevators were not working. Our room was dismal other than the fact that we had been able to secure a \\"garden view\\" room. A non garden view room overlooks a potholed parking lot and either a busy highway or the backside of a supermarket. Anyway, back to our room. If you enjoy a tiny bathroom with a non functioning fan, a closet approximately 3 feet wide, an air conditioning unit that sounds like a jet on take off, furnishings that resemble the stuff you gave to Goodwill 15 years ago, and an overall musty, dirty environment, then this is the place for you! It's obvious that the ownership has let this facility fall into a total state of disrepair. Their motives? Who knows?

Tough and overly salty with a lot of fat running through it. I had to pick out half the meat to find enough that was actually chewable to eat my sandwich. The whole point of making pastrami is to make tough meat tender!\\n\\nThe knishes were soggy and tasteless. The latkes were dry and actually tough, too.\\n\\nI enjoyed the blintzes and noodle kugel and especially enjoyed the chocolate coconut cupcake.\\n\\nMy last thought about Zaftigs is about the price/portion size/quality. I don't mind paying a lot for good food but this food was not good. Plus, the portions were not generous. The sandwich I ate had a really small amount of pastrami on it for a deli sandwich.

We eventually alerted someone in the kitchen that we wanted to dine in and they directed us to the open seating.  \\n\\nTo keep things short, we ordered the Spinach and Stix as an appetizer along with PMS and cheese slices.  The PMS slice was topped pretty well but hubby had to request all kinds of extras to make his cheese slice taste the way he wanted - garlic, butter for the crust, and oregano.  Additionally, our Spinach & Stix appetizer came out well after our slices and was quite underwhelming.  The \\"stix\\" were dry breadsticks with no flavor whatsoever and the \\"spinach\\" was exactly what the description said - spinach and melted cheese within some random veggies.  We were expecting it to at least be of a creamy consistency.  \\n\\nThe service wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  As mentioned earlier, it took a while for us to be seated in the empty restaurant.  The server was a nice guy but was missing in action a couple of times when we needed something.

The Frying Scotsman caught my eye, being first in the reviews, and I was thinking I was remiss in being in the wrong place when I had a yen for fish and chips.\\n\\nSo, this review is a brief comparison for anyone who is thinking about where to go for great fish and chips, because that's the perspective I had while eating there.  Without a doubt The Fish and Chip shop has  the best fish and chips I've tried in Portland.  The cod was extremely soft and delicious and the batter was perfectly light and crunchy.   I also loved the elongated pieces of fish--nicer than big chunks.  The fries were a bit different than anything I've had anywhere.  They weren't crunchy per se, but I couldn't leave one on the plate.  Delicious.   \\n\\nI also had the chowder and it was very good--not too thick, but could have been hotter.  I wondered if it was because there was only one server there and the place was quite busy.  Maybe it sat waiting for her to pick it up.\\n\\nOf note, I tried to bring my son back, and he asked if we could go somewhere else because he saw the sign that the fish is fried in lard.  Not a problem for me (although my cardiologist would surely disagree) , but it was for him.\\n\\nService was good and everyone there seemed to be enjoying their meals.  The touch of having English soccer on the TV didn't appeal to me.  Just put on ESPN, please!!!\\n\\nIn comparison to the Frying Scotsman, if you have a choice of the two, this place is much better, in my opinion.  The fish there (at the FS) chunked out and fell out of the crust.  And while the batter had a very sweet flavor, the fries weren't as good (too thick) and I'd prefer to sit in a restaurant rather than ordering at a cart and sitting eating out of cardboard at a card table in a garage.  (This is not to say the FS doesn't have its place in the world of food carts.  It's good.

The restaurant has a ton of TVs so it can serve as a sports bar too.  The business has been around since 1983.  The restaurant sits right up next to the railroad tracks so when trains roll by, you can really see, hear, and feel them.  Unlike trains that pass through developments such as Atlantic Station, the trains that pass through downtown Vinings don't slow down as much and actually pass through at a pretty high rate of speed.\\n\\nNYPE is a casual pizza joint.  Table seating is available inside and outside.  The enclosed patio tables have umbrellas.  Inside, the plentiful TVs are mostly tuned to sports channels (the others are tuned to news).  The furniture is showing some wear as several tables and chairs are annoyingly wobbly.  Windows face the parking lot, Paces Ferry Rd, and the railroad tracks so you can see trains zoom past.\\n\\nNYPE sells New York style pizzas and Sicilian style pizzas.  The NY pizzas are the \\"standard\\" triangular-sliced pizzas most of us are used to.  The Sicilian pizzas are square-cut pizzas that are also a bit more deep dish.  You can order both the NY and Sicilian pizzas by the slice.  NY slices are approximately $2.50-5.60 each and Sicilian slices are approximately $3.80-6.80 each.  You can also get whole pizzas: 14-inch and 18-inch NY pizzas and small and large Sicilian pizzas.  Those can range anywhere from $15 to upwards of about $30 each.\\n\\nThere are about 10 house specialty pizzas available.  I was told by one of the staff the three most popular special pizzas are:\\n\\n* P.M.S. - stands for pepperoni, mushroom, and sausage\\n* Can't Beat The Meat - pepperoni, Canadian bacon, sausage, ground beef, bacon\\n* The Canarsie Killer - pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, Canadian bacon, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, onions, tomatoes\\n\\nThe Canarsie Killer is the most expensive of the specialty pizzas and understandably so with all of its ingredients.  These pizzas are baked with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce.  Whether you order by the slice or buy whole pies, I believe all the pizzas are made from scratch.  Not reheated.\\n\\nThe slices are big.  I think two slices of the NY pizza are enough to fill most people up.  One slice of the NY pizza plus a side (e.g. salad) would make a nice meal too.  If ordering Sicilian, one slice is enough for one person.\\n\\nIf you like meat on your pizzas, then it's hard to go wrong with any of above.  The Can't Beat The Meat is NYPE's meat lover's pizza and The Canarsie Killer is NYPE's supreme pizza.  Out of the three pizzas, I prefer the P.M.S. the best simply because it's not loaded with as many ingredients.  The topping portions are generous and the mozzarella nicely melts and integrates itself with all the ingredients.\\n\\nThe Canarsie Killer is packed with so many toppings that they easily tumble off when trying to pick up a floppy slice.  It's easier (and less messy) to eat this particular pizza with a fork and knife.  All of the meats on the Killer make it a savory, hearty, and filling pizza.  In general, I've found the toppings to be sufficiently fresh and flavorful.  The crust is A-OK.  There's a good amount of dough, minimal char, and it's got an appetizing chew.\\n\\nAside from pizza, NYPE also offers several different types of salads, Italian dishes like bruschetta, pastas (e.g. spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, baked ziti), strombolis, calzones, and Italian desserts like cannoli and tiramisu.  They've also got an espresso machine.\\n\\nService is fine, though it can take a while for pizzas to come out.\\n\\nNYPE delivers in the Vinings, Smyrna, and Cumberland area.  Check their web site for a delivery map.  Carry-out is available too.\\n\\nOverall, the pizza at NYPE isn't outstanding, but it isn't bad either.  It's average."},{"name":"Boston Marriott Copley Place","address":"110 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Big rooms, staring right at the Pru if you get the right side!

I ordered the Cinnamon Sugar, Honey Seasalt, and their Emmylou chai, for only $9. They make your mini donuts right in front of you, and there's usually some cute dogs lingering outside, honestly it's hard not to fall in love with this place. The warmth of the donuts is what's so special about these little guys. The Cinnamon Sugar sticks to your lips and licking it off is almost as good as the donut itself.

They need to work on their ambience for evening dining (lighting is too harsh in the entrance, table placement, general decor, moving the lunch buffet table, get rid of a TV or two) would make a huge difference in drawing people to the restaurant.  But the food is truly delicious: start with the tasty vegetable samosas or the decadent ghobi manchurian.  The ubiquitous chicken tikka masala is one of the best I've had, creamy, rich, with tender chicken.  The lamb lagan had tender and tasty lamb in a different rich and flavorful sauece.  Tandoori chicken is excellent and well-seasoned (could use a side of masala sauce like other Indian restaurants provide).  The aloo ghobi is very tasty (am looking forward to trying other dishes on their extensive vegetarian menu).  Naan is light, fluffy, perfect for dipping in their amazing sauces.  They have a great selection of draft beer and many unique mixed drinks (which I haven't tried).  The service is great, and all in all it's now one of my favorite restaurants in the area.

There were only about 5 tables of people - not busy, but enough patrons to not make me think twice about eating there.  I'm always happy to not wait for a table.  The restaurant is comfortable and spacious, but there was somewhat strange music featuring high-pitched Asian women playing in the background.\\n\\nMy boyfriend doesn't really like raw fish, so we stuck with more cooked items from Yanagi's extensive specialty sushi menu.  They have a ton of choices!  What people have said about the generous portions is true, as we only split 3 rolls between us.\\n\\nTiger roll (11.95) Shrimp tempura/crab/cucumber, topped with shrimp, avocado, and house goma sauce -- Delicious!! We loved the tangy, citrusy sauce that really made this roll, and the shrimp and avocado on top was arranged beautifully.\\n\\nSalmon tempura roll (10.95) Crabmeat/cucumber/avocado/salmon tempura topped with eel sauce -- This was served with two small salmon tempuras and was quite good. It had a nice flavor but it was not as special as our other rolls.\\n\\nHot night roll (9.95) Shrimp tempura/crabmeat, topped with spicy tuna, house eel sauce, and spicy rayu sauce -- This roll has a good kick to it, with delicate and yummy tuna on top. My favorite :)\\n\\nOur waiter was attentive and always checked up on us throughout our meal. My only problem is that they don't have a menu you can write your order on like most sushi places, and there are too many choices!

Minimalist, clean, bright and inviting.  If I ran a restaurant, I would want it to look something like this.  Added bonus with the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant in plain view.  Kitchens should have nothing to hide.  They have no garbage -- all the packaging and containers were compostable, a trend that we should see more of!\\n\\nUnfortunately, that is where the good things ended.\\n\\nThe cons:\\n* We came in for breakfast around 9:30 AM on a Sunday.  The woman serving us was downright rude.  As a Canadian, it takes a lot for me to call someone rude.  There was only one other person in the restaurant, and we were a party of 6, including my two young children.  \\n* What was available on the breakfast menu was anything but clear.  Thankfully, the options were clearly explained to us.\\n* We were flat out told that it would be impossible to customize either of the breakfast sandwiches so that they would be suitable for vegans, unless all that we wanted was tomato on bread.  That left plain oatmeal with fruit and a muffin, pretty much the same fare that I can pick up at Starbucks.\\n* As soon as we sat down, the music was turned up, to the point where it made talking difficult.  To be clear, my kids were being kids, but we were trying hard to keep their noise level down.\\n* There was a lot of banging from the kitchen.  Large treys dropped into the sink literally a few feet from us.  This may be \\"normal\\" kitchen practice for this location, but my friend interpreted it as passive aggressiveness.\\n\\nMontreal's \\"Green Panther\\" restaurant operates very similarly -- local food, composts everything, all prep in house.  But they take the ethics of what they are doing seriously and don't serve animal products there, and they have /always/ been child friendly.\\n\\nNOTE: I was going to give the restaurant 1 star because when I contacted them about the menu issues, I got not reply.  However, my friend contacted them about the bad service and received a nice reply from Sophie who promised that if we spoke with the head chef next time we were there, he would \\"take care of us\\".\\n\\nUnfortunately, until they make something on the menu worth going in for, we won't be back."},{"name":"Keegan's Public House","address":"4640 Log Cabin Dr SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3","text":"They have delirium tremens on draft.

The signature drinks are fantastic and modestly priced - particularly the cucumber martini made with gin (not a gin fan at all, but this was a stellar drink). The fancy drinks are between $6 and $8 but they also have great beer pitcher prices and even a Sessions bottle for $2 so they don't discriminate for clientele on a budget. The bartenders seemed happy to have a fun group patronize their bar and gave us a couple of over-ordered drinks on the house (um, yay!). We move to a table, hear about the specials, then order the mussels in white wine sauce, the Greek salad, and the unlimited bread assortment. The bread came with butter I wanted to bathe in. It apparently changes, but on this evening it had been whipped with giant roasted garlic pieces and bits of ground mustard. The mussels were fantastic and were accompanied by crustinis with garlic paste that was so delicious I thought it was cheese - no really it was that good. The greek salad was huge and perfectly dressed. Collectively, we tried the Manicotti (house made ricotta was fab!), Baked Ziti, Veal Marsala, a Calzone, and the Ravioli. Dishes were very well priced, fresh and amazing. They were busy and our food took a little longer than it should have (around 40 minutes), but they compensated with service, and later complimentary desserts. I'm by no means an expert on Tiramisu, but this was some of the best I've tasted. The Pistachio and Dark Chocolate Gelato were pretty addictive and we all left fat, buzzed, and happy. We'll be regulars for sure."},{"name":"Kafenio","address":"3387 Main St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"What a wonderful addition this is to College Park's dining options!

That's not good, because it makes you feel thirsty and drink plenty of water. I used to like this place, but their food qualities went down. Their sushi looked very nasty. I could not blame on them, because it is not a sushi restaurant. Their oysters look dirty. I love their boiling clams and mussles. They don't have a lot of selections.  I wish they did not put salt on the boiling lobsters, because it is unhealthy for people with high blood pressure. I hate when they were kept staring at you if you ate too many lobsters.

The restaurant is quite large with multiple rooms throughout the building. It has a sort of blend between a European bistro and southern charm. Even on a Tuesday morning they were quite busy, but were seated within a few minutes of arriving. My wife ordered hot tea (which she complained was not hot enough) and ordered coffee and fresh grapefruit juice. The juice was fantastic, and the coffee was fine (I ordered the house blend, it was a little bit light). The food was what really won the day. My wife ordered the crunch french toast, which is a huge slice of Challah bread french toast dipped in cornflakes. The blend sounded interesting, but man does that little bit of crunch really make for a fantastic plate of french toast! She also ordered a side of fruit which included apple, banana, cantaloupe, and pineapple. I ordered the Greek frittata (with egg whites) which comes with a side of rosemary potatoes. The frittata was fluffy and delicious with a golden brown buttery crust. The olives and feta give it a great Mediterranean spin, and the garlic is very pronounced (which I personally love, but you may not love it if garlic isn't your thing). The potatoes were crisp on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside. I couldn't finish the frittata because it was so filling, but it was one of the best breakfasts I have eaten. I will say the the food did take a little while to come out (the waitress said it was because the frittata takes 16 minutes to cook), but timing aside this place is definitely worth the trip if you are looking for a great spot for breakfast!"},{"name":"Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill","address":"6901 North Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"First and Last time at this fine establishment....\\n\\nIt's guys night, and one of us arrives early.

The waitresses are also originally from Canada and are happy to discuss about their hometowns and what to visit (especially the wine country). Now speaking of wine, if you are above the age of 21, it's highly recommended to try their \\"ice wine\\"- essentially the fruits and grapes are picked when frozen and then used to makes the wine to give it a cool and sugar concentrated taste, in other words it's a cold sweet wine.\\nAppetizers: I should note that I'm familiar with traditional poutine as I've visited Niagara Falls, but this restaurant adds their own twist which makes it superb. I highly recommend the red wine deduction sauce they add to the signature poutine- it gives the fries and white cheddar a perfected smoky finish.\\n\\nMain course: my date had the filet mignon & he highly recommends for those who consider themselves a connoisseur of beef. Personally, I had the Meyer lemon tofu with asparagus pur√©e and Marcona Almonds (the vegan friendly dish). My compliments to the chef!

I really appreciated the three size options for pies, and thought the prices were pretty reasonable.\\n\\nThe coconut cupcake was cold and hard-as-a-rock when I went to eat it, so I had the raspberry/almond bar instead, figuring the cupcake needed time to thaw (too cold in the refrigerator case, maybe?).  The bar was delicious, if a little sweet, with a light, buttery crust and savory filling.   I've never seen that combo before in a bar, so it was a lovely surprise.\\n\\nUnfortunately, even after a couple of hours, the cupcake was still hard.  Not sure if it'd been in the case a while or what, but I ate it anyway.  Even though the cake didn't have the soft, fluffy texture you hope for with a cupcake, it was still very tasty.  The cake was dense, with shaved coconut baked into the batter, and the frosting was cream cheese/buttercream with more coconut, and I appreciated the real coconut versus the artifical coconut extract most bakeries use (I think there was still coconut extract in there somewhere, but it was supplementary).  Very delicious, and with just the right amount of frosting!\\n\\nThe apple/pear/cranberry pie was wonderful.  The cranberries kept it from being overly-sweet, and the crust was the same buttery delight from the raspberry/almond bar.

The seating was open, however, the tables were for 10 or more so a couple will be sitting with 8 other individuals. The lines for the food were very long all night. They brought enough lobster to keep the line going for about 10 minutes before it was stopped while those in line waited for more lobster to be brought.\\nWhile the food was ok, the variety of choices for $50 was disappointing.

And by hook up, I mean...we basically got a $200+ room for $95 a night!  Oh yeah! The only caveat, and you don't know this until you get to the hotel, is that you don't have the option of getting a room with a King-sized bed.  All Hotwire rooms are strictly (for this Hyatt anyway) 2 double bed rooms.\\n\\nAside of that--no biggy that my honey and I slept apart--the room and the hotel itself were rather nice.\\n\\nThe room was tastefully appointed in hues of mocha and teal and the bathroom came equipped with all the toiletries you could possibly want.  My only complaints with regard to the room: they use a damn top sheet as a bottom (why hotels do this I'll never know) so it slides around when you sleep.  GRRR.  The other issue we had was that when I went to take a bath around 12:30am, I couldn't figure out how to plug the damn tub to keep the water in!  We called down to the front desk, thinking they would just run up one of those rubber stoppers...um, no.  They sent this poor little worker bee up to our room with a WHOLE NEW DRAIN component.  As in, he had to completely pull the metal drain out of the porcelain and then cement a new one in...at 1am!  Not sure if this is a plus or a negative. GREAT that they would go to such lengths at such a late hour...bad that I fell asleep waiting for the construction in my bathroom to end.  Sheesh.  The second night however, the bath i took at a more reasonable hour was much more delightful!\\n\\nThe restaurant downstairs is just ok.

December 2013\\n\\nMy review is a little delayed however here it is.  \\nI decided in October that the upcoming dinner festivities at Christmas were becoming more challenging as my Dad was confined to a wheelchair and so was his Guest.  Normally it would take pre-booking Handi-Dart or some other way of transporting them out to my Sister's place and then lifting people up three flights of stairs. A bit too much as you age and my Father said he felt he didn't want to keep trying to do this.  So, as he lived most of his life in the West End of Vancouver, I came to decide that I would see if the Sylvia Hotel would be open for Christmas. This was in October.  \\n\\nAfter leaving a message with the restaurant with details that I needed seating for 3 with 2 of the people in wheelchairs who could feel comfortable and not seated near a doorway (which tends to happen unfortunately because a majority of places don't have room between tables for wheelchairs to be places at smaller tables) I received a most wonderful message from the Food & Beverage Manager, Kim, who personally spoke to me about my needs.  \\n\\nBecause it was so close to Christmas we would have to have our dinner quite late (8pm) but i was glad to just be able to have a place to take my Dad on Christmas. \\n\\nThe menu from their site showed a 3 course meal: \\n\\nStarters were either Duck Salad or Butternut Soup \\nMain: 3 choices: Turkey, Ham or Salmon Dinners with all the fixings that you could ask for. \\nDesert: 2 choices: Chocolate Yule Log or Traditional Plum Pudding. \\n\\nCost: $40.00 per person. \\n\\nUnfortunately Dad passed away however, I had promised to take his Friend, rather than leave her alone and I certainly felt that he really would have loved to have been there. So I called back and let them know about the change, again I received a very kind message from Kim who also let me know that they had a table even earlier around 7pm.  I decided to invite a friend from Paris to join us. \\n\\nUpon arriving, we could see how incredibly busy it was but it was beautifully decorated with classy sparkle, tasteful, traditional colors were placed throughout, just enough to make you feel like it truly was Christmas but not so overwhelming that you felt that they went way overboard where it can appear gaudy. The lighting was perfect, light enough to see, but definitely played up the candlelight at each table. \\n\\nWhen I went up to speak to the Hostess, I was also greeted by Kim who went out of her way to introduce herself and it made my Dad's friend feel very special which on this occasion was so sweet to do as my friend was feeling a little down since Dad wasn't with us.  I could also see that all hands were on deck, including Kim, who was assisting with everything. \\n\\nThe ambiance was quite, traditionally classy, you could see many groups both small and large of families, many appeared to be mixed and quite a few couples. It felt very relaxing. \\n\\nThe Service: The Servers were absolutely fabulous. Very attentive and obviously were also run off their feet. But each gave a hand if you needed something extra and were helping each other (we like that!). \\n\\nThe food was good, the salad I have to say although smaller side, was delectable, my Parisian friend had the Salmon and said it was perfectly done, both myself and my Dad's friend had the Turkey dinner. I did find that it was plated well, but it would appear that they may have been running out of it since you could tell it portioned very tightly. I could appreciate several things: This is Christmas, they're serving probably 300 or more people. So we didn't really care about that much and the desert, the Chocolate Yule log was fabulous.  We didn't leave stuffed but comfortable for sure. And the best part was : No dishes to do,we weren't dashing home to get away from obnoxious relatives and the staff didn't hurry us out the door, there was plenty of room for the seating arrangements.  \\n\\nAlthough it was our first go at having a dinner at a restaurant at Christmas, I would return to the Sylvia in a heartbeat and we will do this next year as well. \\n\\nIn consideration of how far they went to accommodate us for special requests I would give them five-stars. \\n\\nWhat I would suggest is that you call much earlier in the year rather than what I did, in order to get an early seating. The views are beautiful and the cost was extremely reasonable."},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Worst service I have ever had in my LIFE.

Before pouring yourself some tea, I suggest filling up the entire cup with ice because the tea is pretty warm, but I guess that depends if you want warm or iced tea. The chicken was delicious and probably one of the best pieces of fried chicken I've had. The mac and cheese was pretty good, and I enjoyed it with their ranch sauce. I don't know how they make their ranch, but it is some of the best ranch that I've tasted. The portions are huge, and this sandwich was a good two meals for me. Definitely not the healthiest option out there, but I recommend sacrificing a meal (or two) to come and try what they have to offer!

The lower \\"wine cellar\\" dining room is a bit bigger, but still cozy.  The prices are the best in the North End.  Most entrees are under $20.00 with a few items over $20.00.  You won't find that in the North End.  Don't let the prices fool you. The food is rustic Old Style Italian cooking - among the best in the North End. Massimino's is tucked away on the corner of Endicott Street, well off the beaten tourist path of the North End which explains the prices.  Even with the limited number of tables, we were not rushed to finish our meal.  We were more than well taken care of by our wonderful waitress Francesca.

Our first visit we had no clue what to expect and asked our server what was most authentic or a specialty of the restaurant and she gave us several options. We still couldn't decide, so we asked that she surprise us with her favorites. I am still unsure of what exactly she gave us but it was a cold rice paper role for an appetizer, a main course that had fresh and cooked elements (I do know the meat was pork), and a mango smoothie. She was very kind and 'held our hands' through the entire ordering process, as well as serving us items that she felt would provide an authentic and delicious experience. \\n\\nThe food was delicious yet very different compared to our normal pallet of flavors. It combines a lot of sweet/savory, hot/cold and textures. The dishes are colorful and full of exciting new flavor pairs that work well in making a great dish. The portions are more than we can eat in a sitting and the price in relation to quality is excellent and the service is great. The smoothies are so good! They're not the boxed extract full of sugar stuff you get at a coffee shop or chain, they actually taste like mango and they use fresh produce to make them! I was pleasantly surprised and this is a great desert to follow a meal. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is modern with bold colors (Ohio State Buckeye theme) with a slick simplistic appearance and large storefront windows. There are a few too many tables, so the space is a bit more cramped than I prefer but it didn't affect our service at all, it just didn't provide a lot of privacy between tables. Since the location is a storefront in a shopping plaza, the parking can be a little difficult but we've never had to park too far from the restaurant. \\n\\nOverall, the food and service provide a great experience and they use the location they have well.

If you're going to be around Austin anyway, why not get some authentic BBQ?\\n\\nWhen you come to Lambert's for brunch, stick to gussied up home-cookin.  The mac and cheese here will literally clog your arteries after your first bite.  It is melted cheese, butter, and nothing else.  It is basically cheese and cheese and mac.  Delicious and gut-busting.  Potato salad is pretty solid, good flavors and not heavy.  Smoked salmon is buttery and light, with a non-solid texture that is different than your normal meatier versions.  Grits, sausage, and bacon are not the forte here.\\n\\nAfter sampling their buffet line, grab a slice of their pretty-good brisket, and then order up some of the real goodies.  The brisket hash has a perfectly sunny-side up egg that spills yolky goodness all over smoky beef and potatoes.  The hanger steak eggs benedict is outrageous.  Tender steak on top of a crisp, buttered English muffin topped with a poached egg waiting to drip over your steak, all covered in a perfectly delicate hollandaise.\\n\\nSo get your moneys worth here and keep on ordering whilst avoiding the typical breakfast fare.

We love Indian food and eat it often.  This was our first time here and we ordered the Palace Dinner for Two.  Lots of variety, but we were mostly disappointed.  The samosas and Mulligatawny soup were good, but overly salty.  Pakoras and papadum were very good.  I was really looking forward to the chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken and they were both very bad.  The tikka masala sauce tasted strongly like tomato paste (my husband thought ketchup) and the tandoori chicken was greasy......ewww.  It was like they bought frozen chicken wings, added some flavorless red color to it, oiled it, and roasted it.  It was gross.  Fortunately, the bhuna lamb was quite good.\\nThe food here is definitely hit and miss, but the misses were terrible.  The good service won't be enough to bring us back.  Goodbye India Palace.

The Meatballs served with Ricotta and Marinara sauce and slices of Italian bread is a great value! It too could be a meal or an appetizer that 3-4 people could share. Even the olives appetizer are marinated in just the right amount of seasoning to make them irresistible.\\n\\nIf you have been to Brooklyn, and had  pizza fired in a wood oven, and have seen the bubbly chard goodness then this is the place for you.

No problem. The host staff was really sweet and lovely as they greeted us, let us know our wait times, texted us when our tables were ready, and settled us in. \\nPersonally, I recommend, that if it's your first time, try a couple of dishes out. \\nMy friend had the crispy wontons to start and I threw down on the pickles. My friend could not stop raving about the sauce that comes with those wontons, and I think she was sadder when the wontons were done mostly because that meant the end of eating the sauce. The pickles are a low cost, simple, and refreshing start to the meal in my opinion. A little chili oil, tossed over some pickled cabbage. \\nSo, my friend ordered the char Siu. Essentially this is a build your own slider platter. It comes with 4 buns, really beautifully sliced Chinese BBQ pork, shaved onions and cilantro it's a LOT of food and I tried a slice of the pork and it was really flavorful and tender. Also, buns have the most delightfully addicting and pleasing texture ever and the waitress asked my friend if she wanted more of them. So I guess that's an option.  I'd highly recommend this for ya meat eaters out there.\\nI ORDERED THE Dan Dan noodles to share, and Mapo Dofu. The Dan Dan noodles were the star of the night. An AMAZING vegetarian bowl of noodles that will make your tastebuds start giving thanks. The bowl comes with little bits of friend tofu, these incredibly tender and flavorful mushrooms, the most perfect soft boiled egg that you'll ever eat, and bokchoy. \\nFor a vegetarians---it can be super unsatisfying to eat in restaurants Bc you never get a meal that feels hearty, homey,  or savory. This dish gives it to you. You fold everything together and everything I THAT bowl plays off of each other perfectly. \\nOf course with the Mapo Dofu, it's not vegetarian at all, since it's covered with ground pork. Honestly if this dish wasn't so salty---it would have been a HUGE winner. The tofu was cooked like every damn vegetarian our there wants to learn how to cook their tofu. Perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully soft on the inside. Really solid dish.\\nI wish I hadn't ordered dessert at the end of the night because this gin joint (btw I got an extra dirty martini here as well, and it was awesome)...would have been almost flawless if I hadn't. The egg custard was unfortunately a really dry, flavorless pastry that looked so sad on the saucer it came out on. RIP custard.\\nAll in all, DEFINITELY give this place a try. I'm a Wu Chow devotee and now I'm literally going to have to think about it when the craving for solid, delicious Chinese food takes over my cravings. (Let's be real though, this place has more vegetarian showings that are actually impressive so we're probably gonna head here.)\\nSo stop on in, as Biggie plays over the sound waves  and you bite into some incredibly, thoughtful and delicious food."},{"name":"Doc's Motorworks","address":"1123 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I came here for lunch for the first time in June.

The restaurant is decorated with crawfish memorabilia, sea nets, and fish. There were at least 5 televisions placed around the restaurant for customers to watch while eating. The tables/chairs and booths were a little old school that could use some updating. There's no plates, just waxed paper like how they do it at Rudy's BBQ. The staff was very attentive and very friendly and they seemed to have a lot of repeat customers or locals who would yell across the restaurant to talk to the staff about personal matters. \\n\\n We ordered the raw oysters on the half shell and they were alright, nothing really stood out in terms of quality or size. What we really came for was the crawfish. Each person ate about 2 lbs each, some more than others but the crawfish turned out better than I had thought it would. I've had some bad crawfish restaurant experiences where you can tell the crawfish had been frozen previously or they just weren't that fresh because the shell was soft and the meat had a sort of soft, semi-mushy texture. This place really impressed me because the crawfish seemed fresh and the flavor was there. They can also vary the spiciness in each individual order depending on personal preference. Each 2lbs comes with 1 potato and 1 corn, which is a bummer because I love potatoes with crawfish so I had to order extra for $0.50 each. Our friend tried the gumbo and said it was very good. Too bad they didn't have cajun rice and only had white rice. \\n\\nThe one odd thing that did happen was that my fiance's 2lb batch of crawfish had a small beetle looking bug in it that he found as he was eating. The staff was very apologetic and the cook/owner even came out to apologize and explain to us that it was a water beetle that attached to the crawfish and it is very hard to screen for them. They were very professional and  offered a new 2lb batch for him right away. If I'm ever craving crawfish in Austin and we're too lazy to make some at home then  this is definitely the place to go."},{"name":"China Pearl Restaurant","address":"9 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"It has been well over three months but the phrase \\"dim sum\\" still triggers my mouth to salivate like a Pavlov canine.\\n\\nChina Pearl is marked by an unmistakable plastic sign that hangs above the doorway. Upon entering, there are immense stairs, carpeted with elaborate gold leaves with a burgundy background color. It is a monumentally large restaurant with substantial seating. There was no wait on a Saturday morning when we arrived around 11. We were seated immediately and next to the grand kitchen doors. \\n\\nThe establishment is bedecked with ornate gold Chinese letters, Chinese paper lanterns that are fixed to the ceiling, and garnished with cherry blossoms. They have an extensive selection of dim sum. All the dishes we tasted were freshly made. One of my favorite items is the Sesame Balls which come in a set of three. They are glutinous rice balls that are filled with a sweet, smooth red bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and deep fried. There are Crab Balls that are made from imitation crab; the \\"pink slime\\" of fish. These are discernible as they are coated in shredded wonton skin, and festooned with a crab claw. These are quite large and are served in a pair. The Taiwanese You Fan, has a literal translation of \\"oil rice.\\" It is sticky rice that is steamed and fried in a wok with shi-itake mushrooms, pork, and pork fat. It glistens with rich fat and is topped with freshly cut cilantro. The dish is served with a thick, sweet, and slightly spicy chili sauce.\\n\\nCustomer service here was attentive and helpful.\\n\\nSome Pro Tips: Sit close by the kitchen. Not only are your dishes guaranteed to be fresh, but the staff will not miss you. Cards are accepted. When you order multiple dishes from the staff pushing cards, be sure to keep count of how many stamps she is applying to your bill. It is easy to lose track if you have an array of dishes already on your table. Also ask whether a dish is small, medium, or large.

We finally went last night for the first with a couple friends to check it out.\\n\\nService was off from the start. The girl who was greeting people at the door seemed a bit frazzled and confused. The guy at the register was laughably bad: he was having a side conversation in the middle of our order and he was SO obvious about trying to upsell every single item. No, I don't want queso with my parmesan truffle fries--that's insane. When my \\"Little Larry\\" drink arrived, it was seriously 2 ounces in a highball glass, and when I made a comment about that, the runner said that they didn't have any more of the right glasses and that's why it looked so small. He told me that the \\"Big Larry\\" would come out in their large frozen margarita glass...but of course it didn't. It came out in a wine glass.\\n\\nBut the food, as always, was good.

We shared the fries and a kale salad and there were plenty of leftovers.\\n\\nWe would have given this location three stars because of the aforementioned customer service issues, but we're taking off another star because of the interaction we had with Jake, who came out after we filled out their iPad survey about our \\"experience.\\" Instead of having the professionalism to either apologize for the snafus or to comp one of the drinks, he instead defended the over upselling as wanting us \\"to have the full experience of Hopdoddy.\\" It's like he was reciting what he learned in a training session instead of reading his customer and handling the situation smartly. He ended by saying, \\"Well, if you come back, ask for me, and I'll take care of you.\\" NO! Jake, that's NOT how it works. You take care of the customers right then and there so they want to come back! You offer a drink, a small gift card, an apology, anything!

Normally the family will go through almost all of the pizza with maybe a couple of pieces left over for the kids. My kids each only ate one small slice. The tomato base tasted like it was tomato paste straight out of a can, onions were supposed to be on the pizza and were there but very skimpy. All the ingredients seemed very low quality.

The potato salad, though, was the star of the show. Perfectly combined ingredients and packaged separately in its own little container, for late night revisiting.

In addition, we got the greens and beans. \\n\\nI opened my container of pulled pork. The pulled pork was nice and tender. Its juice flowed right into my taste buds. The texture conformed to my tired and hungry mouth. But, boy, was mouth waking up! Then I tasted the sauce, don't get me started. This was among the best BBQ sauces I have ever tasted. It had a rich taste marked by a hickory smoked flavor. The brisket was also exceptional in quality. Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I actually enjoyed the sides. The greens, while a little on the liquidy side, were overall quite appetizing. The baked beans had a nice smoky flavor. \\n\\nAll in all, add it all up, this place is legit!

It's the perfect balance of sweet and salty. The Strawberry Rhubarb is also a stand out, the fruit was refreshing after the ridiculous sweetness from the other donuts. Overall, the donuts were delicious and reasonably priced.

However, be prepared for a wait if you want a table- it was at least an hour wait when we arrived at 6:15pm on a Saturday for a table of 2. I'd highly recommend you stop by at least an hour before you want to eat to put down your name, since they text you when your table is ready. We ended up meandering up to the bar area upstairs and lucked out on bar seating right away, so were in an out in less than an hour. The great part about sitting at the bar is you can get drinks right away, and also sample some of the beers if you're indecisive like me.

The bread was very dry, and I couldn't taste any almond flavor. The salted caramel butter was delicious, but I'm not sure it really went with the chocolate bread. I wouldn't get the bread again but would order the butter to go with bread or something.\\n-Totchos (Fried Tator Tots, Spicy Green Chili, Crispy Pork Belly, Andouille Sausage, Cheddar Cheese Sauce, $10.50, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=y2NsVOPY0f67oaNvyNdPHA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The tator tots were nice and crispy on the outside, and very fluffy on the inside. The cheddar cheese sauce was good, but I didn't think the other ingredients really went with the totchos (crispy pork belly [although there were very few tiny pieces to be seen], andouille sausage, spicy green chili). I would have preferred if they went more of a classic Mexican nacho style and had sour cream, ground beef mix, green onions, etc. I would definitely order the tator tots and cheddar sauce again, but not this totcho dish as a whole.\\n-Too Chocolate Stout (5.8%, $8.50): Definitely had a great chocolate flavor, and it was very smooth. However, the body of the beer was too thin for me, and more porter like than stout. I wouldn't get a full glass of this.\\n\\nWe had eaten way too much ice cream and sweets earlier in the day, but regretted not ordering one of their famous milkshakes and/or sundaes since they looked amazing.

It's in my neighborhood, and I've driven by it dozens of times as I exit the drive-through of the McDonald's right next door.   Not only was it my first time in this restaurant, it was my first experience with Vietnamese food.  Won't be my last.\\n\\nI figured I'd better try the pho since it was my first time, and pho is one of the quintessential Vietnamese dishes.  You'd think a bowl of soup wouldn't be enough food for supper, but I couldn't finish mine.  It was loaded with noodles, rare beef and onions, and, as is traditional with pho, came with a plate piled with fresh basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, jalapeno peppers and lime.  It was all good, but the broth was easily the best thing about the dish.  I don't know what's in it, but I could taste something like cinnamon or nutmeg.  Suffice it to say, it was different in the best possible way.  My wife also had pho, a combo version with several different meats.  We identified sausage, sliced beef, roast beef, and something else that had a rubbery texture and could've been tongue or skin.  Whatever it was, my wife loved her pho as much as I loved mine.\\n\\nI got an iced coffee to drink, and it came to the table as a cup of ice and a cup of hot coffee, still steeping into the cup from a little metal steeper on top.  I was a little dubious at first, but it turned out to be delicious.  It was easily the blackest and strongest coffee I've ever had (it looked like motor oil), but tasted amazing.  My wife had the fresh-squeezed lemonade, and it was great, too.\\n\\nThe interior doesn't have a whole lot of charm, but there's a big mural of a beach scene, tall red curtains to block the view of the parking lot and the abandoned Toys-R-Us across the street, and a couple of TVs.  It's a little different that the wait staff don't have a consistent uniform or even attempt to dress up (our waiter was wearing a T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops), but no big deal.  \\n\\nAbout paying the bill:  When I was in Japan, one of my favorite things about eating out was that you never had to wait for a bill.  When you were done, you just got up and went to the cashier, and they would ring you up without any paper involved.  Well, it's the same way at Hoang, and I appreciated it.  It also wasn't lost on me that most of the people we saw coming and going during our meal were Vietnamese.  If it's good enough for them, it's great for me.\\n\\nEDIT:  About an hour after I ate, I got a mild headache, then I started feeling warm all over and a little light-headed, like I'd had a couple of drinks.

After trying several kinds, the most outstanding qualities about them are that they're overrated and a complete caricature of what real cannoli should be. \\n\\nThe filling is overly sweet and grainy. Authentic Italian ricotta cannoli filling should be smooth and silky in texture.

The strawberry cannoli tasted artificial. \\n\\nGiven that my college cafeteria could mass-produce better quality cannoli using untrained student workers, I'm not too impressed by these cannoli. I'm not sure what kind of Italian tradition this place claims to be passing on, when they can't substantiate the claim with their products. The closest thing to real Italian cannoli I've tasted was at Termini Bros.

It was ...pretty good... but it was nothing to write home about. The flavor was nice but it had a kind of an overly chewy texture.

I'm usually not a fan of sausage but I loved the taste of their sausage.

I was a little hesitant because of the reviews but I figured that she'd been before so it couldn't be that bad. How wrong I was.\\n\\nThe three of us were seated downstairs around 6pm on a Friday without a problem. Our server comes with bread and oil. The bread is not warm. Just regular  bread you can find at the store but I devoured it because I was hungry. Two of the girls ordered the baked tortellini and both liked it. I ordered the linguine with littlenecks in a white wine sauce. The amount was good but the pasta was bland. It was basically pasta drenched in oil and not very well seasoned. I could have made better linguine at home.\\n\\nAfter we're done eating, we're sitting and chatting. The waitress then come up to us and tells us to finish our conversation at the bar so our table can be used. We were pretty shocked by this treatment so we packed up and left to a nearby bakery.

If you come any time after 4pm, you will have to wait for at least 30 minutes for a taste of mass-produced Italian sweets.

But sadly we ate there a few nights ago and the other reviewers, I am sad to say, are right; service and quality have gone way down compared to what this restaurant used to be like. I always order the filet. This time, my filet was cooked perfectly, but no flavor to it, I had to add salt. The mushroom risotto was soggy and mushy, there were no mushrooms to be seen either. The asparagus-tomato relish, might as well not be served. It does nothing for the dish and in my opinion would be better left off the plate entirely. I would prefer fresh asparagus spears to accompany my steak than a relish on a $50 meal. My husband ordered the black angus ribeye and it looked more like a skirt steak in thickness and was overly fatty, a good 1/3 of his steak was fat and gristle.  My daughter had the best meal there, off the children's menu. She had the grilled stripped steak with fries and it was very good, next time I may order that, except we don't plan to return, there's way too many excellent restaurants at WDW to choose over this place. As for the service, it was just okay. Our waitress was nothing special and definitely not \\"Disney\\" as my family wood say (meaning happy and pleasant). They were not busy, so she wasn't overly busy or being pulled in too many directions, as I have seen at other restaurants with much more pleasant staff.

World of Disney is the largest store with the most variety, but there are more specialized shops available as well. TrenD has more of the stylish articles of clothing and accessories, including purses and wallets by Doonie & Burke. Mickey's Pantry has a larger collection of useful items for your kitchen and also recipe books. Team Mickey has sports-related clothing, accessories, and souvenirs. There are also stores that are \\"outside\\" of the Disney realm such as LEGO Imagination Center, Basin, and littlemissmatched. These are just a few of the shops that are located in the Marketplace section.\\nIf you get hungry, you have several restaurant options, including Earl of Sandwich (which I highly recommend), Wolfgang Puck Express, and if you're more in the mood for dessert, Ghirardelli.\\n\\nPLEASURE ISLAND\\nThe mid-section houses mainly restaurants and shops that aren't Disney-related. It used to be the \\"adult\\" section of Downtown Disney, but it has since been reformed to be more family friendly. Admittedly, I have not spent a considerable amount of time in this section due to my lack of interest in what is offered, but I am hoping to try the different restaurants on a more regular basis soon.\\n\\nWEST SIDE\\nI miss the mere existence of the Virgin Megastore that used to be present in this section. I would often simply walk around for hours without purchasing anything. And I'm sure there were countless others who did the same. And therein lies the reason they closed down. Darn! Soon, the expanse space that has been left mostly empty will be replaced with an upscale bowling alley called Splitsville. \\nThe West Side has, surprise surprise, even more restaurants! Celebrity-owned restaurants such as Planet Hollywood (though this might arguably be in Pleasure Island) and Bongo's live here, and are in my opinion only mediocre yet necessary for a tourist spot.\\nI often find myself in this area for concerts at House of Blues, and have occasionally also be entertained by Cirque du Soleil: La Nouba, DisneyQuest, and the AMC Theaters which offers the Fork & Screen option as well as the new sound system, Dolby Atmos.\\n\\nWHY I COME HERE A LOT\\nHonestly, I am at Downtown Disney a lot to get souvenirs for friends and family who get excited that someone can get Disney stuff for them easily.

The view up and down the beach, the view of the water, the mountain view... drink it up.    \\n\\nSylvia's is old school meaning it's not fancy but it's comfortable.  I liked the casual, quiet vibe from the moment I entered.  Of course, since they've been there forever (they're Vancouver's first cocktail bar) it was important for me to get the drink that had also been there forever:  the 1954 ($7 Canadian) was a remarkably fresh vodka/chambord drink littered with delicious fruit.  Get it.  \\n\\nSylvia's has live music on some nights and, when I visited, excellent service.  Nobody is trying to turn tables; they seemed fine with me staying as long as I desired.  Lucky for me, when I finally left, the sun was still setting over the bay.  Drinks, a view, a beautiful sunset; a perfect close to a perfect week in Vancouver.  \\n\\nThank you Sylvia's.

What caught my attention about this place was the overall rating... (dun dun dun).  So my friend and I came here spur of the moment.  Parking is available on the street (metered), we got lucky.  When you walk in, you're greeted by the Take Out side of the restaurant, upstairs is where the tables are.  They have two different menus, lunch and dinner.  We both got the Pad Thai and the smoothie drinks.  Pad Thai was, below par, really below par.  Oh the smoothies looked like alcoholic beverages!  Tasted more water then anything though.  Customer service, what? We ordered our meals, food came pretty quicky thereafter.  No one came to ask us how our meal was, if there is anything else we need, etc.  Biggest downfall is CASH ONLY.  It would have been nice if someone told us prior to sitting down and ordering. it's 2013.  Restaurants taking cash only? Other then that, the pictures on the wall were nice.

The 'Q however, while delicious, doesn't make my Austin Top 5. I have two major issues with Lamberts -- the service and the service. Those are not the same nits. I will explain. The service as it pertains to the classic sense of the word was great once we sat down but the maitre-d' left my dining companion and I standing there for a good 2 - 3 minutes while she attended to important things like folding napkins, making sure the pile of menus was straight, etc. Very uncomfortable. Then, as if she'd just noticed the pair who'd been standing in front of her for awhile, looked up, acknowledged our existence and even found time to show us to a (lousy) table. There were about 2 other tables at this point in the day. Not sure what that was about. \\nThe other service issue is, well....Lambert's is kinda fancy. BBQ was never meant to be served in a linen-napkin environment and if you really like Q like I do, you don't mind getting it all over your body. Hells, I roll around in dry rub for fun. It's also a great exfoliant, but I digress. No, Lamberts would do well to drop the high-falootin thing and put paper towel rolls on the tables like most places. Of course the prices match the fanciness, which is another nit. I spent almost $20 on my lunch and still was hungry 2 hrs later.

But, nothing left more of an impression on me than the food. Longing to find authentic Brazilian food, not just consisting of meat being paraded from table to table on a metal stick, my reading efforts lead me to Botekim.  As I dined on two appetizers of Braised Beef Croquettes and Brazilian Pork Sausage, full satisfaction of my reading efforts set in. The croquettes were a perfect balance of a crunchy outside with a tender beef filling, accompanied by a tangy Dijon mustard sauce. While toggling between the croquettes and sausage, my friend and I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner, in which he enlightened us and explained the sausage is freshly made with their own recipe. Such details provided the reasoning as to why the sausage, adorned with caramelized onions, was so superbly tender.  \\n\\nAfter scoffing down the appetizers, our server brought out Saut√©ed Flounder, and my face illumined with eagerness. Starring at this dish, the tender flounder was charmingly topped with mushrooms, capers, and shrimp. As I ate the first bite, the butter and white wine married with the salty bite of capers happily infused my tongue. After devouring every bite, including the silky mashed potatoes, going all the way with dessert was a must. The Passion Fruit Mousse was a luscious, creamy mousse with such bold fruit flavors, that I asked our server if there was alcohol in it. She politely laughed and said no.

I actually just got back from lunch at this place and it was terrible.  Pad Thai was boring and not delicious, fish and chips was overly fried and wasn't good, the bon mi (sp?) sandwiches weren't that great.

This restaurant is not a fine dining restaurant and should not be compared to such. \\n\\nAmbience:\\nThe two-story building is in the middle of Cambridge, and upon initial glance, looks more like a shack than a restaurant. However, once you enter, you get the look and feel of what a restaurant in India resembles: The heat from the kitchen out in the open, the slightly cramped area where people are ordering right next to the small tables where people are eating, and the water coolers and steel trays that you use for the meal. That being said, I always prefer to take Punjabi Dhaba's food to-go to my room just because to me, lounging around watching Netflix and eating Indian food makes incredibly relaxing nights when I'm stressed. This seems to be what a lot of people do (especially other students), but it just depends what type of atmosphere you want (bustling vs relaxed).\\n\\nFood:\\nAs for the food, I'd argue that this restaurant is one of Cambridge's finest Indian restaurants. In comparison to the extremely expensive Maharaja or the fast food chain Chutney's, it simply put is much better food for its prices. I always get the Grilled Chicken Tikka for 10$ with Naan (Comes with it) and a Samosa, but have also tried their Dosas, Chaat, and curries. The reason they lost 1 star is because some of their food doesn't match the quality of the other items they serve (South Indian Dishes like Dosa and their Chaat items), and this might be attributed to the fact that they are not cooked as often as the other ones. However, that being said the Chicken Tikka and both their veg and non-veg curries are phenomenal. The flavor in each dish is always phenomenal, and is why I always return to this place so frequently. At comparative Indian Restaurants in the area, you have to pay anywhere from 15-18 dollars for similar dishes that don't even stand equal to the flavors that PD provides.\\n\\nAltogether though, highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fun night out or looking for a great take-out spot for a night in.

Other than that you should expect to enjoy fabulously tasting cocktails in a great atmosphere. \\n\\nIn fact, cocktails are the only reason you should really come to this bar at all.  They don't offer many beers and unless you want a crepe, there are no other food options.   \\n\\nHowever, there weren't even very many house cocktail choices, only about ten.  I perused the menu trying to find one that looked good but couldn't.  I settled on one with gin, maraschino, and orange bitters.  It was horrible.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I wasn't the only person disappointed with the cocktails.  EVERY person in my group of five did not like their cocktails. NO ONE enjoyed their cocktails.  We each tasted each others and all agreed that every single cocktail was bad.   For a place where cocktails are clearly the focus, you have got to revamp your menu.  \\n\\nWe also tried a lemoncurd, cheve and lingonberry crepe.  Tasty for sure.\\n\\nAtmosphere and ambience were lovely.  I do not know what the space looked like before - so I'll assume the owners are behind this great industrial space.  It looks like many other bars throughout cities across the country - exposed brick; industrial lights, large wall of booze behind the bartender, art-room stools and of course, a stuffed elk's head hangs proudly from a wall.  \\n\\nService was fine, by no means friendly, but attentive. \\n\\nI just can't shake how poor the cocktails were.

We went there per a recommendation from one of the girls for a cheaper Italian meal that was away from the typical Hanover Street crowds.\\nFirst, the location is a plus. Being on Endicott St., you do escape the tourists. The venue is also very rustic Italian, it's a small and intimate space. \\n\\nThe 4 of us had a 8PM reservation and our table was ready pretty much right on time. While we waited a few minutes, we found that there is also a downstairs with a full bar to sit at when waiting. Once we sat down, we were approached by our very loud and charismatic (for lack of better phrasing) server, Mike. He belted out the specials at us while throwing in the occasional personal, awkward joke. I guess it comes with the territory. Throughout the meal, he kept referring to our group as \\"Gucci Girls\\" (whatever that means?!) and would get very close to us when speaking to the table (also awkward). \\n\\nThe menu overall was great. There was plenty of different dishes to choose from and all of them were reasonably priced. Typically resting somewhere between $16-$22 for large entree portions. We were also presented with a decent wine menu (we split a bottle of red). In choosing your meal, I would take caution in ordering the specials. These are often significantly higher in price than the other choices and they do not mention this to you when ordering. \\n\\nThe dishes came out in well under 20 minutes and the food was great. I personally had the veal piccata and I found it to be perfectly cooked, seasoned and to be a good selection for the venue. It also came with a side dish of ziti with sauce. My friends were similarly pleased with their entrees. \\n\\nAt the end of the meal, we were given free glasses of limoncello for the table and we were able to split the bill four ways without any hesitation from the staff. \\n\\nAlthough the server was a bit on the outrageous side, the food and location of Massimino's makes it a worthwhile choice for dinner. I would just advise patrons that the staff is loud, the venue is smaller, and the specials are much more expensive than the rest of the menu."},{"name":"Bento Hut","address":"349 Decatur St SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I ordered delivery through yelp the other night.

Both the staff and the clientele are friendly; one time we had a fairly sizable group squeezed into their basement, and the people crowded around the tiny bar were good-natured about our little invasion, and the waitstaff was amazingly solicitous, considering (sometimes, in large groups, my friends and i can be a little hard to deal with; not unruly, just...  odd).  The basement pretty well sums up the ambience of the place; cozy in the extreme, but not in a way that feels cramped.  The food is also spectacular; everything they prepare feels like someone fussed over it. The pasta is pretty much perfect.  This doesn't come cheap, of course, but it's very reasonable.

The last time I was there I had the duck sandwich, and it was quite possibly one of the tastiest things I have ever put in my mouth.

She was awesome provided great recommendations , quick service and was patient .\\n\\nI ordered the Belgian waffle with a side of bacon and apple pork sausage and my boyfriend ordered the 2 egg scramble with scrambled egg,roasted potatoes,bacon and sausage . His meal typically comes with toast but she allowed him to substitute for French toast for about $5. The food came out fairly quick was fresh and hot. This has had to been one of the best breakfast I've had so far.\\n\\nThe ambience was okay, small space with alot of people wasn't ideal for me..I felt smothered..

I ordered the chicken risotto which had no chicken btw. I asked the waiter if the risotto was supposed to have chicken but he didn't know. The pork belly sliders were really bad. My brother ordered the May Contain Bacon burger and he didn't like it either. The only thing I enjoyed was the warm chocolate almond bread and the desserts were delicious!

They need more doors to cover the kitchen areas it smells damp.  So to make it a quick reference: The food is ok, they need better chefs, but the view makes it worth it.

They won't seat you until the entire party is there and we were promptly seated once we all arrived. \\n\\nThe place is cozy, as mentioned, but accomodated a lot of people. The tables were very close together, and most people there were in large groups so it was really loud and personal space did feel invaded.\\n\\nSome of us started with various drinks at the bar. I think the lemon martini was a hit, as was the sangria.  Hot tea is also available; apparantly the brand used is very good and hard to find.  \\n\\nWe were given a bowl of kalamata olives (large ones) and amazing focaccia bread.  I loved the extra salty crust on it.  We were given unlimited refills too, which is yummy!\\n\\nThe menu is not large; so you should find something on it that you like.  We started with the roasted asparagus and a spinach salad.  The asparagus had an amazing smoky flavor and a fried fresh farm egg. The salad was equally delicious, with a nice citrusy vinagrette and some great red grapes and pine nuts.\\n\\nFor the main meal, most of us got pasta dishes.  I had the tortonocci (sp?) which was giant tortollini stuffed with eggplant, tomatos and spinach.  It had a nice chardonnay sauce. It was divine.  Others had the stracchi (sp?) which was a basil pesto pasta with some veggies. It had an overpowering olive oil flavor which took away from the dish.  The pizzette, with onions and grapes looked good and someone ordered the fish of the day which had nice green beans and mashed potatoes.\\n\\nWe did all sample desserts: lemon tarte, gelatos, chocolate cake and creme brulee. In my opinion the gelato was the winner--candied blood orange espresso, chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla. So creamy and delish.  I think the creme brulee was the worst as it was served in a ramekin and not a flat dish so it felt like more of a souflee.\\n\\nIt is not a cheap spot ($35 with tax and tip and no liquor) but the food was great.

You can get their 'everyday' flavors for about $1.50.  It's a small shop in Quincy.  The Babycake cupcake had whipped cream in the middle, it was nice.  The Red Velvet was a little dry, though I suspect it is because it was a few days old (it was a Saturday and they only make that flavor on Wednesday).  Overall, the cakes were good.  The size was neither big nor small.  I don't think I would make a trip out of the city for them, but if I lived in Quincy I would try them again.\\n\\nPetsi's - the Red velvet was pretty good, but the Whoopie Pie was outstanding.  it was very chocolately, but not overwhelmingly so.  My bf doesn't like overly chocolate stuff, but we both loved this one.  It probably helps that it had just come out of the oven about an hour before.\\n\\nKickass Cupcakes - I'm basing this review on all my kickass experiences (I've been about 4 times).  The Red Velvet was totally weird.  It was red on the outside, but I swear it was carrot cake on the inside.  Strange.  The Mojito was excellent.  I have to say, Kickass makes my favorite cupcakes second to the Sprinkles Red Velvet (LA).  Sure, they're on the smaller side, but I don't need a huge cupcake.  The frosting is out. of. this. world.  It's buttercream, I think.  It just doesn't have a crazy butter flavor.  It's not too sweet (if you think it is, come to LA and try a cupcake here!).  The cake itself is pretty awesome.  It's different than other places.  It's moist on the inside with a crust on the outside (kind of like a muffin has).  The consistency gets an A.\\n\\nWe chose Petsi's because the fresh cupcake we had was so good and her prices were in the middle.  She was the only place that was willing to give us a discount.  And, in general, I just like the owner.\\n\\nAn interesting thing about these cupcakes vs. LA cupcakes is that they are far less sweet.  It seems like all the cupcakes in LA are made with cream cheese frosting in LA.

The only time CG has fallen short thus far has been with a trout dish which was a daily special (not a regular selection) anyhow.  \\n\\nAnother drawback is that it can get exceedingly noisy (complete with screaming mic feedback) on Tuesday - trivia - nights.  But \\"Think Tank\\" is un-explainably yet definitively better than the \\"Stump\\" game found in just about every other bar across Somerville and Cambridge.

The ambience is dark and candlelit, though not always quiet.  You may have to wait for a table or sit close to someone else during peak hours.  The entrees are AMAZING.  Salads & bread are a little boring so if your date only eats salads or fried fare, take her someplace else.  Good selection of wine.  \\n\\nI'm particularly fond of the unusual seafood specials - lots of variety.  Of the regular menu items, I enjoyed the swordfish (great spices), spicy red sauce (with pasta) and the crab cakes (not all at once of course!)  The crab cakes are unusual and the best I've had in Boston.  When the red-haired chef is there, we know we're in for a treat.

Good fore-shadow for a great experience here at Bits and Bites.  Finally I walked in on the 6th, excited to try this place hoping it would still be similar to Hall of Fame, and I was very much let down.\\n\\nIt's obvious they are trying to specialize in frozen yogurt and smoothies so I tried one out.. asked for a mango smoothie, and my fiance asked for a frozen yogurt.. so the owner, literally took the smoothie machine out of the package and started assembling it in front of us, as the other lady behind the counter couldn't figure out how to use the frozen yogurt machine... we waited 25 minutes for our desserts!!  They didn't wash the smoothie machine before making mine, so it had a delicious hint of cardboard and plastic and apple juice.. the baby sliver of mango that he charged me almost an extra dollar for, was freezer burned.. this delicacy cost me 7$.  My fiance's frozen yogurt was nothing more then average (besides the 6$ it cost me).  Very bland, simple, average frozen yogurt..  she asked for oreos, so they charged us almost a dollar for 2 whopping oreos, ground up to obliteration..\\n\\nHow are your products freezer burned after being open for 2 days???  How do you not have your machines set up after your grand opening which was supposed to be 3 days ago??  How did I not get a small discount or something when I waited almost a HALF HOUR for a crappy drink, that I couldn't even drink enough of to get me sick yet.\\n\\nFor some reason we came back here a few weeks later, thinking maybe they got there crap together and figured out how to run a restaurant and make food.  Wrong.  I got a Honey Buffalo Wrap.  I insisted the worker from Hall of Fame: Melvin make it for me, so I could guarantee its Exactly what I love.. and he did excellent, no thanks to bits and bites, this was a Hall of Fame wrap.  My fiance got a salad with mandarin and walnuts.. they ran out of her salad dressing, walnuts, and they didn't have carrots... they offered to replace the walnuts with pecan, fair enough.  What they DIDN'T tell us was that instead of lettuce.. like a good normal salad would include.. they gave her spinach and avocado instead.. It was AWFUL!  And they charged us an extra 50 cents for an extra half a shot of salad dressing... between my wrap, her salad and 2 drinks, our total was 24$.  I could have eaten a fine meal at the Chateau for that..\\n\\nOne last try, I had allergies yesterday.. super sore throat, I needed something cool. So I got a frozen yogurt with strawberries, kiwi and mango.  The 1 strawberry, half a sliver about half the size of my thumb, and 1 slice of kiwi was freezer burned, and cost me an extra 2.50$, on top of the 5$ for the frozen yogurt base, which they didn't clean properly, so it tasted like cheesecake, because the customer in front of me ordered a cheesecake frozen yogurt..  so 7.50$ for a GARBAGE frozen yogurt.\\n\\nBits and Bites is JUNK, I cringe and get in a bad mood every time I see the ugly guacamole green and dirty red colors when I drive by.. and I'm surprised to see they're still in business even after only 4 weeks.\\n\\nBad food, bad prices, awkward menu, new employees are clueless... there is NOT ONE good thing I have to say about this place.\\n\\nUPDATE: \\nMy friend came here for a frozen yogurt.  Warned the employee she has a deathly bad peanut allergy.. and to make sure the machine is properly prepped accordingly.  The guy working at the counter looked at her like she had two heads, pushily insisting she tell him what flavor she wanted as if she was wasting his time.. not only was he rude, he was ignorant.. didn't wash the machine or anything.

The cucumber gimlet was light and refreshing, and my colleagues really enjoyed their Thai Basil cocktails, variety of on-tap beers, and even sake.\\n\\nDecor was interesting, warm and quirky with solid wood bar tops.  Service was attentive and professional.  Drinks were refilled quickly and without fuss.  This place was a crowd pleaser- as we had girly-girls and manly men, and everything in between- everyone seemed comfortable, even my colleague with food allergies, who was catered to properly.\\n\\nHalfway through my second (or third?) gimlet, I thought I saw Ming Tsai greeting guests, serving food, and being his amiable self.  Yep, it was Ming Tsai!  He came over and chatted with us, asked us how we liked everything, and was present during our 4 hours at Blue Dragon.  This is not a famous chef in a pristine office somewhere, he was getting his hands dirty..... and he's adorable..... but not as tall as I had previously thought, but that's okay!\\n\\nSoy-glazed Chicken wings- AMAZING.

The flavors were outstanding but the chewiness factor kind of killed the pleasure.  \\n\\nThe service was a little iffy from the moment we sat down.  It took at least 10 minutes to get our drink orders taken and another 10 to get our drinks.  It was off and on throughout the night and eventually she made a comment about how busy she was.  Yes, it is Friday night in Austin and the restaurant should be prepared for \\"busy\\".  \\n\\nThe highlights were definitely the rock shrimp and the oysters (according to our friends...we don't do oysters) as appetizers.  Also, the mac n cheese was good but was trumped by Fleming's the following night.  The asparagus was also well prepared.

I did that thing once where I ate them all and Boyfriend got none (I have no idea why the man stays with me).\\n\\nI did have a couple concerns though.  The menu is really hard to understand, and I don't think I'm an idiot.  It's laid out funny where you kind of don't know where to look and you don't exactly know what your options are.  Also, the owner was talking to us at one point about the hot dog special of the day and we had trouble even locating where it was on the menu.  It shouldn't be so confusing just to order hot dogs.  That's why hot dogs are so great.\\n\\nThe other thing may be mostly a personal preference, but one of the times we came, one of the employees came out and was just dropping a lot of behind the scenes knowledge on us: a local business that said they were coming in and then didn't, how hard it is to lose food to the time/storage/expiration date quandry, even said something not great about another Columbus hot dog place.  I was not into this noise.  Listen, dude, I am at your restaurant.  I am having a good experience.

I was a little surprised to see that out of nearly 1500 reviews that the restaurant only received an average of 3.5 stars. If the rating system is based solely on the food, I would say that's a fair grade. The food was good, but just not anything out of this world nor exceptional---which is not a bad thing per se. However, our server, Nicole was amazing and was very kind to accommodate us (there were 6 in total) with our requests. And, when I ordered my second Brussels Sprouts appetizer and it didn't come crispy like the first time, she apologized and immediately and corrected the issue. And again, when my salad came with the onions on it (I have an issue with eating raw onions and they upset my stomach), she quickly whisked away my plate and a new correct salad was brought to the table swiftly. My friends also had a minor issue with their order, but again, she fixed it right away. Nicole had a great attitude, a friendly demeanor, and really helped make the experience go well.

It took us about 20 minutes to decided what we wanted because nothing really stuck out. Once we got our meals we were all disappointed. My father had the pot roast which he mentioned had no flavor, my meatloaf was super dry and my wife's steak was over cooked. Seeing as we spent $22 on a ribeye we decided to just let them know it was over cooked. She ordered rare but received well to medium well. The server told us that the two section on a ribeye cook differently and that is why its over done.... Little did she know my father and wife are both meat cutter...

It something that is nice to eat when you are in the mood for noodles.  Noodles in hot soup makes a very good comfort food.  I also like throwing in the leaves, beansprouts, hot sauce, and a dash of lime.  Its good stuff, but I don't think the quality changes a lot from one pho place to another unless you are served stale noodle, cold soup, stinky meat or any of these combinations.  I end up ordering P18 because all the meat is cooked.  I like hot soup with my pho and the soup tends to cool off too fast when they put in raw meat.  The crispy spring rolls were pretty good too.

The food is okay. It's pretty standard, a little more fancy than pub fare, type food.  It's kind of like the menu at Ceili's but more extensive I think. It's not mind-blowing by any means.  The thing that bothers me is that it's quite expensive for what they serve and the quality.  Maybe it's because they have high rent since they're on campus and in the newer Dentistry building.... Either way, it's a good place to go for work lunches or something.  The drinks are okay.. but I usually don't get any because the idea of spending $18 for just a simple meal like a sandwich or burger at lunch irks me a bit.

Friday night I had an extremely frustrating experience. I went with a friend around 830pm. We originally purchased an hour of golf. At about 20 minutes into it we purchased an appetizer (loaded waffle fries... not a difficult item to make). 45 mins into our hour the waiter came up to ask if we wanted to extend (keep in mind this was 25 minutes after we ordered our appetizer). I stated that we want to add more time but I was frustrated with how long it was taking for the appetizer to come out and we wanted to purchase additional time after our appetizer had arrived considering we had been waiting on it and were hungry. The waiter explained we had to add more time or vacate the bay. I was confused by this because we already said we were purchasing more time and that the lack of prompt food service was frustrating to us as well. We wanted to play and eat and not be frantically trying to do both at the same time. Or having to waste a full 15 minute purchase of more golf time and let the food get cold. After back and forth with the waiter clearly was going nowhere I just said add the time whatever. Sure enough my point was proven when the food came out another 10 minutes later we were rushed to play and eat. And the food did get cold considering both (my friend and I) could not enjoy the fries at the same time. Then a bit later in the night we ordered two desserts. Same thing happened. The waiter continued to pressure us to add more time and said we would be kicked out of the bag if we did not purchase more time. This time he said that we couldn't stay in the bay and wait for our desserts if we were not going to buy more time because people were waiting. He suggested we either buy another 15 minutes because desserts wouldn't take longer than 5 minutes to come out (which we doubted considering the appetizer took a ridiculous amount of time). We told him to make our desserts to go because we did not believe it would be 5 minutes and we were done playing and \\"buying\\" into this guys poor customer service. On top of that I walked around to the restroom and noticed several empty bays on our level (2nd floor) and saw only one group of 3 people at the front entrance desk. So the waiter was misinformed or just being pushy for no reason. The desserts came out approx 10-15 minutes after that conversation. The waiter said he took off one of the 15 minute additional time blocks bc the desserts took longer than anticipated (shocker). I tipped the waiter 15% as that number seemed to be the theme of the night. I, however, shouldn't have tipped him at all considering his poor customer service. I asked to speak to a manager upon receiving the bill however no one came after some time so we paid and left. While there are other places to play \\"top golf\\" in the area it disappoints me to have such a horrible experience one time here and have it tarnish my perspective of this place as a whole."},{"name":"Massimino's","address":"207 Endicott St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now and haven't been impressed.  Tonight my roommate and I went and she ordered the fried calamari while I ordered the garden salad and linguine and clams.  My salad was OK, nothing spectacular, although they put their dressing (creamy peppercorn?) on the side which is a nice touch.  When the linguine came though, the clams were SANDY. I mean, not the slightly sandy texture you could expect from clams but I was literally eating chunks of sand.  The pasta itself was also pretty sandy, so I sent it back.  The waitress told me that she would make sure they would clean it \\"especially well\\" this time, so I had them make me another one. When the second linguine came after 10 minutes of waiting and my roommate was finished with her meal, the first clam I ate was sandy, and so was the second. I had to send it back, and the waitress came back and told me \\"we all tasted the clams and they weren't sandy, maybe you just didn't like the dish?\\"  I was kind of shocked.  It wasn't my first time I had eaten clams and properly cleaned clams (all you do them is keep them in water!!) are NOT that sandy.

We were hoping it would be open around noon so we could head on over there after the graduation.  But we got there around 1:30 pm and they allowed is to up in and sit in the waiting area but we were not allowed to be seated until 2 pm.\\n\\nInitially, when we walked into the door it smelled very fishy.  But I guess that would be expected when they are a majority seafood buffet.  I say majority because there were some chicken offerings as well.  \\n\\nThis place is a casual restaurant and not the place to be cute.  Be warned, your hands will get messy and sticky from the lobster tails and crab legs.  It is a bit pricey about $42 per person for the buffet which does not include a drink.  But with having all you can eat Lobster and Snow Crabs on the menu the price is somewhat warranted.  \\n\\nI tried a few things from the cold bar.  The black pepper shrimp was really tasty and the salmon plank was seasoned very well.  The cold bar also included crab salad, mussels, asparagus, italian salad and cold slaw among others.  I also tried the crab cakes and some mussels that I did not care to eat too much about.    They tasted average.  But I skipped right on to the snow crabs, blue crabs and lobster tails.\\n\\nThe crab legs just like the other reviewers commented on where so delicious and seasoned to perfection.  When dipped into the garlic butter it melted right in your month.  I only tried one lobster tail.  It too was very good.  The one I had It was not over cooked like others mentioned.  But, I too preferred the crab legs over the lobster.  I ate so many crab legs I thought I would make myself sick from overeating .  But, I didn't.  My mouth is salivating as I speak about them.  Oh, and the corn on the corn added made a great side.  \\n\\nThen I topped everything off with some sweet desert.  There were square slices of lemon meringue pie, brownie squares and carrot cake squares among a few other offerings but the carrot cake was my favorite.  It was moist and very delicious.   This place has so many offerings. Also, you can request a bib to wear if you ask your server for one.  I did and it helped in not messing up my clothes while I dived into my crab legs.

I've been meaning to try Mother's out for almost a year now and I finally had the chance to come here last week. Knowing how popular this place is and the fact that I was hoping to dine here at noon on the Friday before a three-day weekend, I made reservations and highly recommend doing the same. Even with reservations, my friend and I had to wait around 15 minutes to be seated. \\n\\nWalking in, this place is really cute and much bigger than I thought. I especially loved the fancy chandeliers and white curtains juxtaposed against the warm brick walls and wooden floor. I was delighted to find out that I could still get breakfast at noon on a weekday here, so I decided on getting a half order of their crispy french toast and breakfast biscuits (biscuits and gravy) for half the cost of each plus a dollar. As someone who is way too indecisive, I really like how Mother's allows you to get two half orders instead of just choosing one dish. I thought that the french toast bread was nice and moist and not overly eggy, and I liked the addition of crispy frosted cereal lining exterior of the toast for the crispy texture effect. This was a good dish, though the breakfast biscuits reigned supreme of the two choices. The biscuits were so extremely fluffy and buttery, probably the best I've had in Portland. The gravy was well seasoned and a good consistency, though a little lukewarm for my liking. I also had a bite of my friend's tofu hash with added feta ($1.25 add-on) and it was also super tasty. The tofu was cooked thoroughly and the portion of feta was generous. \\n\\nThis is really close to a 5 star spot in terms of flavor, but I'm rounding down from 4.5 stars due to the slightly lukewarm gravy and the long wait for our food (around 35 minutes).

In fact, it might be underrated, despite the rave reviews, long lines, and the community's general obsession with this place.\\n\\nI even visited on a Saturday and endured the long Saturday line, saying silent prayers that they wouldn't run out of chicken. Still, I wasn't disappointed. The line was wrapped around and out the door when I arrived, and surprisingly, about 35 minutes later, I was eating/devouring/thinking all the happy thoughts that come along with eating something truly special and indulgent. Not only did the line move quickly, but HCT staffers walked through the line several times as we waited, handing out menus if needed, answering questions, and spreading cheer to the hungry masses. What a special touch this was - it saved me from feeling like just another person in a long line about to be anonymously served hot chicken and sides. Instead, I felt valued and appreciated as a customer before I'd even placed my order or made it very far in line. I LOVED  that.\\n\\nObviously, I took advantage of the free banana pudding with a Yelp check-in, and it was the perfect cherry on top of a truly amazing meal. It was salty, sweet, and simple. I had the sandwich (hot), giving into the temptation of enjoying the slaw on the sandwich but also getting double mac. The slaw is bursting with pepper and vinegar and the perfect accompaniment to the spicy fried chicken. The dill pickles are a perfect touch as well. The chicken itself is juicy and perfectly cooked on the inside, fried in the just-right way that makes for crispy skin without making the meat itself chewy or dry. The spice level is just right - hot without being painful (but I love spicy foods, so if you have a low spice tolerance, I'd get warm or cold). The mac and cheese is exactly what you hope for when you eat mac and cheese - sharp, flavorful cheese, each bite creamy, some bites have a little crunch. I did not regret my double mac selection for a second. \\n\\nI will be a return customer, many times over, not only for the food but for the impeccable service. HCT could get away with doing the bare minimum service-wise, since the food is good enough to make folks return regardless, but the staff really goes out of their way to make the whole experience top-notch."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Pardon my circa-2005 lingo, but Hot Chicken is the bombdotcom. I could wax poetic about the concept, but I'm going to focus my words on the food and the overall experience at the North Market.\\n\\nThe community style ordering/seating is fantastic right off the bat. It's great to sit next to some fellow chicken-lovers and enjoy a meal. And you'll probably have a lot to enjoy, because the actual bird is fantastic. The meat is perfectly juicy, encased in a delightfully fried and none-too-greasy, crispy skin. The accompanying sides, mac n' cheese and slaw, can certainly be polarizing. As Bryant M has commented to me, and I wholeheartedly agree, the mac n' cheese is \\"grandma style,\\" which means a softer texture and simple cheeses used. No smoked gouda with panko here, folks. The slaw is pretty damn flavorful, though, with plenty of vinegar and a nice crunch to the cabbage. \\n\\nI took the chicken down in one fell swoop but I still saved a tiny bit of room for their banana pudding. It. was. magnificent. It was banana cream pie reimagined into a portable pudding. I would like to order a vat of that, please. \\n\\nSo, yeah. Hot Chicken Takeover.

Kind of made me feel like I was in a movie, especially when the \\"owner\\" Penelope Toothsome and her robot companion Jaques walk around and greet tables. To my knowledge, they do not stop at the bar though, and are pretty tough to flag down so if having them visit is important to you, you should sit at a table. Super fun to watch, and an overall great ambiance.  \\n\\nWhile sitting at the bar, I enjoyed the personal experience that I received from the employees in their HILARIOUS outfits. They gave educated, details suggestions for drinks and I chose the Chocolate Coffee Banana martini to start. If you're looking for chocolate, this is NOT a good way to go; the martini is more like a creamy banana martini with a HINT of chocolate and coffee. I love banana though, so I was okay with it, but if you're expecting chocolate-banana in equal parts you will not be happy with this drink as it is VERY strongly banana and very little chocolate flavor. \\n\\nMy second selection was the Curious Cacao. This drink hilariously comes garnished with a giant piece of coconut cake (I did not eat it) but this drink could literally be your dessert. Once again I had a lot of trouble tasting any chocolate in this beverage -- this could be because this drink is 100% liquor, no mixers, and consists of coconut run, creme de cacao, and chocolate liqueur. It tastes like strait liquor, too. After two drinks, I was feeling pretty good about myself -- maybe that's what the cake was for. Woops! \\n\\nI shared the \\"totchos\\": tater tots, spicy green chili, pork belly, andouille sausage cheddar cheese sauce. These were DELICIOUS. If I hadn't been on a date I probably would have scooped them into my face like a barbarian. They were cheesy, perfect amount of spice, not too much sausage or pork belly but enough that you don't feel like you're not getting your money's worth. I didn't want to share AT ALL. I definitely recommend these. Another item that I believe is a MUST ORDER is the chocolate bread. Although it seems dessert-y, it was a delicious way to start the meal and only costs about $3.00. Totally worth it! Comes with salted caramel butter that is to die for. \\n\\nMy second visit a friend and I sat at a table -- around 2:00PM we waited around 20-25 minutes, which was reasonable and spent in the gift shop looking at merchandise and looking at a menu. When we were seated, I wanted a standard chocolate martini. The server seemed confused and conflicted, stating that they did not have a chocolate martini like they serve at other restaurants. I asked if maybe they could make one, considering they have all of the chocolate ingredients, and she seemed very hesitant and suggested the Vanilla Chocolate Cocktail instead. I agreed, and decided to try it because why not? \\n\\nThe Vanilla Chocolate cocktail is EXTREMELY strong. Once again I had a lot of trouble picking out any chocolate flavor in the beverage, and instead tasted strait liquor. This one has vanilla vodka, dark chocolate, Faretti chocolate, and chocolate bitters. It is extremely bitter -- I drink strait vodka with a splash of water most of the time, and I had a bit of trouble drinking this because of the strong alcohol flavor. Not for the faint of heart, and DEFINITELY not your standard chocolate martini.\\n\\nWe started out with the Philly Cheesesteak rolls (kind of like eggrolls.) These were alright, but I felt like they could be bought in the grocery store, and I would skip them for the tater tots, nachos or another more unique appetizer. They were also a bit spicy, so if you order them for a kid they probably will not eat them -- they come with a delicious cherry pepper aoili that I wanted to put on EVERYTHING though. \\n\\nMy companion got the Blue Plate Burger, which was SCRUMPTIOUS, and the portion was pretty large. Comes with a big side of fries and came out piping hot. Stacked high with meatloaf, potatoes, gravy, cheese, corn -- leaning tower of burger! Super flavorful and one of the more unique burgers to order here, a really great choice if you want something different. I ordered the broccoli cheddar quiche, with a side salad. The fruit served with the quiche was fresh and delicious, the salad was a larger portioned side salad. The quiche was the most disappointing part, and seemed like it had been sitting out for awhile. I wouldn't order this again, I would go with one of the more unique entrees. \\n\\nWe ordered a milkshake, but after 25 minutes (dessert takes a long time here) we had to cancel it, so I will have to go back for that!

They may be smaller doughnuts but you can get more for your money. Make sure to get a punch card to earn some free doughnuts in the future. \\nThey are always warm. They make them when you order them. There is simply nothing better than a warm Pips on a cool and crisp Autumn day. \\nPips does chai! They do it pretty well actually. I like the lavender chai the most. Get a flight to discover which chai is for you. \\nPips is about community. Of course they want to make money, but they care more about people than profit. They are good to their employees, making work hours that gives them a life outside of Pips. They donate (doughnate?) to charities that employees care about. \\nLooking forward to my next Dirty Wu on a Wednesday."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Authentic and traditional indian food.

We found the staff arrogant, rude and dismissive.  After several years and several visits to Epcot, we decided to try Le Cellier again, especially given the glowing reviews here at Yelp.  Well, it was a bit better.\\n\\nWe did have reservations for an early evening dinner (5:30) and yes, we waited again along with a constant large group of others.  The menu is very narrow both in the terms of appetizers and entrees.  And the wine menu, outrageously expensive and narrow especially in the whites.  (Excuse me, I find it difficult to drink red wine in 90 degree heat regardless of the entree.)\\n\\nI ordered the NY Strip and while it did have a flavorful sear, it was just okay.  If it was prime, they were ripped off, but likely, it was choice.  For $50, I am sorry, it's just not worth it.  Hello vegetables, where are you?  My wife's chicken looked and tasted like a frozen dinner.\\n\\nBut, there was no argument with a manager, so that's improved.

One time one half of the steak was well done and the other have was more like medium-rare; I don't even know how the managed to get it to cook like that. \\n\\nI decided to give the steak one more chance, this time I got a bacon wrapped steak, again, ordered medium-well. When I got more Oder there was no bacon, and it was cooked medium-rare. Before I even cut into the steak I told the waiter that I ordered the bacon one but said it was alright as long as I didn't get charged for it. Then I cut into it to take a bite and it was really pink inside, again I told the waiter and they took it back and said they'd cook it a little more... after that it was BURNT and totally dry. I ended up eating half of my boyfriend's dad's Parmesan Crusted Chicken because by the time it would have taken the restaurant to cook me a new meal everyone else in my party would have been long done with their meal.\\n\\nThe staff was really kind about the situation, took the steak off our bill and apologized, but being a Steakhouse I found this unacceptable. I don't understand how the waiter could even bring the steak out to me after the way they cooked it the second time.\\n\\nThe Parmesan Crusted Chicken is delicious and the Wild West Shrimp appetizer is amazing, but I would NEVER get steak from this location again. And if you like your steak cooked anything above medium I do not recommend getting it from here.\\n\\nThe wait during weekends is usually pretty terrible, but I've learned to expect that from any restaurant, it would be nice if they had more seating and room inside for guests to wait though.\\n\\nIt is also far too dark if you go after sunset, its almost difficult to read the menu."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Basically, our waiter ruled, the food was AWESOME but the hostess needs to go.

It was really rude of her and I'm actually going to complain to the manager when I go there tonight to see Mandy Lauderdale.

In the great Mike's vs. Modern Pastry cannoli rivalry, I'm not sure where to come down, but at Mike's they are bigger and they have florentine shells as one of the options.

We needed extra bread with it, which cost us an additional dollar, but it's worth it not to let any of that delish spread go to waste!\\n\\nOur pizzas were also fantastic... between me and my parents, we split two pies: the sausage & peppers, and the spinach & ricotta. Both were so yummy. We all got uncomfortably full because we just couldn't stop eating. We took our leftovers home... only 3 slices. Hah. My sister got the mac & cheese... I took a taste, and it was awesome! She got it without jalapenos, so I can't speak for the \\"original\\" dish, but it was great sans jalapenos. The house salad was also yummy... the greens were so flavorful! A far cry from the iceberg lettuce and refrigerated tomatoes you get at other pizza places!\\n\\nDrinks were also good... The cherry Adult Italian soda was great!\\n\\nAnother huge factor in the likability of this place is their sustainable business practices. This is a big deal for me; I guess you could say I'm a hippie. I love that they compost and recycle, and I think it's awesome that they grow a lot of their own veggies. Apparently they'll be putting a children's garden outside, so I can't wait to see that. They also make their sausage and meatballs in-house, and do their own pickling, which is cool. Didn't experience the pickles, but the sausage on our pizza was delicious. I didn't get any after-dinner coffee, but I was informed that their coffee is fair-trade, which is another big deal for me.

They all sounded partially amazing and then there was an element that I would be like really? Thankfully I went with more brave friends who took the lead on ordering and I just reaped the benefits. Started out with the tuna poke with gochujang. It was really well done with the contrasting textures and flavors. Then the blt with lamb bacon. I've never heard of lamb bacon before but it's amazing. That and the tomato jam were delicious. I've never had tomato jam either but it's pretty much like really sweet tomato pasta sauce but thinner in consistency. My favorite dish was the fried chicken sandwich.. The chicken perfectly cooked and the papaya salad slaw in there, genius! The crunch factor, the tang factor, the yum factor.. It raised the bar for me on all future chicken sandwiches. We also got the short rib which was pretty good, definitely liked the crema that accompanied it. Got the cookie dough for dessert which was really cute but it was the most disappointing of all the dishes since there was nothing special about it besides the presentation. But overall a great meal!"},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Everything was exactly right - better than the other places we went so far.

I make a stop every time I'm in Portland. I brought my husband a few days ago and he proclaimed them the best doughnuts he has had all year  We're from O'ahu but planning a birthday trip around Pip's so we can get in on that free dozen, LOL. Come for the doughnuts, stay for the chai. Prices are reasonable enough to try every flavour, but I particularly enjoyed Raw Honey & Sea Salt and the Dirty Wu!"},{"name":"Crawfish Shack & Oyster Bar","address":"2013 Wells Branch Pkwy, Ste 106","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"If you are looking for fancy, or just something nice inside, then move on.\\n\\nThis place is about the food.  And the boiled items are as good as you can get anywhere, and the fried seafood is really delicious.

Although a cannoli is about $3 a piece, I usually found them really tasty to eat and they are fairly big. Using really rough estimates, a cannoli is approximately 13 cm long end to end, and 4 cm wide at the midsection. \\n\\nOne of my favorites that I usually get is a simple Yellow Cream Cannoli. The outside shell is nothing too special but it has a nice crisp to it but the yellow cream has a nice, soft and sweet texture. \\n\\nA great choice that I also liked was the Ricotta Florentine Cannoli. It has this amazingly sweet, crispy, caramel and nutty taste on the outside shell. This is the best part of the cannoli, and I think it is my personal favorite. It has some chocolate chips and I thought they were decent and went well with the cream. \\n\\nOther than the cannolis, the only other pastry that I had is the Yellow Cream Puffs. I was out one night with some friends, and after ordering a bunch of pastries, we went to a nearby park to chill. I sat down with one of the girls in my party, and she said to me, \\"Do you want a cream puff? I have a bunch.\\" She and I each ate one, and the outside was a little rough but chewy, and the inside had a nice and sweet texture. While eating, we had a really cool conversation. So the Yellow Cream Puffs are a decent and somewhat less messy alternative to the cannolis.\\n\\nI also had some cookies and cream ice cream at this place and I thought it was tasty but a little pricey. I think I had to pay $3 and it was served in a small cup. \\n\\nI'm pretty sure that there are better places within the North End that also serve better cannoli, but this is a pretty good choice if you are willing to wait a little bit and get a big cannoli. It's a cash only place."},{"name":"Out of the Blue","address":"215 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I'm not really a fan of seafood, particularly sea critters, so I can't say much about their calamari, lobster, muscles,  scallops, etc. I did really like the baked haddock I had and the grilled swordfish I tried. The haddock was well seasoned, moist, and reheated well when I had the leftovers the next day.\\n\\nThe wait staff was prompt and conversational. They had a pretty wide range of wines to go with your meal. Cozy little place just down Elm from Davis Square proper."},{"name":"Vinotopia Restaurant & Winebar at Cinetopia Mill Plain","address":"11700 SE 7th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Well...I probably would not come back here without a discount (we had Living Social tonight for both the theater and restaurant). It was fairly spendy; with regular theater tix at $15.50 each, it could be over $100 for dinner and movie. But still...we ate at Vinotopia AFTER the movie, at 9:30, and there was only 1 other couple at a table but some at the bar. The waiter was super. \\n\\nThey brought 4 baguette-sized slices of bread with a cup of olive oil. Cute. Our LS coupon gave us an appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 salads...but the waiter told us we could split a salad and split a dessert instead, which is what we did. The artichoke/spinach warm dip was yummy...but served with tortilla chips? Weird. There should have been some more bread or something. The Caesar salad was actually good, with both garlic and anchovy tastes (usually not found in a regular restaurant Caesar). My entree, shrimp and bowtie pasta, was tasty. Shrimp not overcooked. Sauce a little too lemony for my taste, though. Hub had chicken Marsala, which was gross. I know Marsala is sweet, but you need to cut it with white wine and maybe some salt and pepper. His tasted like it had maple syrup. I insisted he take some of mine and mix it in, which made it edible. We  took a Snickers cake to go because we were stuffed. Hint: If you go after the movie, don't fill up on popcorn. Ugh."},{"name":"Plant Mission Kitchen","address":"1322 25th St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Amazing Vegan options! The seating area is comfortable and well decorated, I love their aesthetic and especially the bucket list or \\"before I die\\" wall. The food was so good, pleased my whole family of 4 Vegans and 1 Vegetarian. Another upside, the queso they use is nut-free, so not a problem for my younger sister with allergies. Definitely order the horchata and try the churros. Both are heavenly! They were out of ice cream when we came, but I'm hoping they'll have it next time so I can give that a try.
