There were not many servers around to take our orders, but luckily you can place an order at a fancy tablet on each table. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, Queso Creation, and the Players Platter which is a sampler platter with spinach artichoke dip, hot wings, and fried cheese balls. While we waited on our food, the boys went to play. There are tons of arcade games for everyone! They have classics like Skee Ball, basketball, Mario Kart, and air hockey. They also have newer games based on movies like Jurassic Park, Walking Dead, and Transformers. In addition to arcade games, there are also activities (at an additional cost) such as bowling, a ropes course, and laser tag. We waited for at least an hour to an hour and a half for our food to arrive. It took forever and all the kids were so hungry! Once we finally got our food, it was just ok... Some of it was actually pretty bad. The fried cheese was supposed to be similar to mozarella bites; however, they were highly disappointing and not worth the $19.99 for the platter. The wings were just ok and queso creation wasn't very good either.

OMG!...had me shaking my head after the first taste of each different portion of the meal as if it couldn't REALLY taste that good. I had to stop every so often just to text my friends and tell them how phenomenal it was. \\n     Now don't expect a five-star experience. This is good food. Period. It's not exactly a greasy spoon, but it sure isn't the Ritz Carlton.  It's small, but the \\"homey\\" feel is apparent from the second you open the door. Expect long waits, but you may get lucky if you just come by yourself like I did. I was able to just ask to slide onto one of the counter stools after only about 3 mins of waiting.\\n     It's pretty basic service, no frills, but it's full of southern hospitality just the same...someone, probably the on-duty Atlanta cop (yes, there is one) will write your name down on a sheet of paper, and when a spot becomes available the cashier will say your name over the loudspeaker so that you can hear it if you are waiting outside and you'll then seat yourself wherever, at whatever table is open for you.This place is always humming, but  the food is so good that you won't mind the noise or the wait.\\n  I imagine that just about everything on the menu is phenomenal, but on Sundays only the Sunday dinner portion of the menu is available. Not to worry though, plenty of scrumptious things on there as well. I had the smothered pork chops, collard greens, macaroni & chz, and an extra side of candied yams...complete with corn muffins and an iced tea/lemonade mix called an \\"Uptown\\". It was great.

So sadly, my decision making process of what to eat when we ordered came down to what sounded yummy.\\n\\nFirstly, this location is a bit hidden. You'd could easily drive by it and not even know it's there. Even when in the complex it sometimes looks closed, don't fall for this, they just happen to have heavily tinted windows as the sun beams directly in here in the late afternoon. If driving from Aloma or South Semoran, you can just turn right into the complex, if you're driving from points north, you're better off turning left on Casselton Dr.\\n\\nSecondly, this literally is a bakery, store, and restaurant. At first glace, you'll just see bakery and store, which has many a great items and fridges filled with some awesome looking meats and even hot dogs in their casing (calling all NY hot dogs lover who love having their dogs snapping when you bite into them). But the restaurant is to the right with just few booth seats (convenient if you're swinging by for a quick lunch) as well as a large seating area in the back of the store.\\n\\nNow the food, its a small menu and my limited experience with Russian food doesn't help in my regards to how it should taste/be prepared, but I went with how happy were my taste buds and tummy while eating and lets just say I wish I had more... which then of course led to us ordering dessert too. This is very rare and having chosen the Karina cake (layered honey and butter cream cake), I was so glad we finally decided to dine here.\\n\\nI will absolutely be returning here for some food shopping, especially around the holidays!

Their signage is nearly non-existent. You can park out back, but the rear doors are closed so you have to take a trek around to the front. Inside the d√©cor is wanna-be beer garden (granted, it was winter), the chairs and tables are rickety and tightly packed, there's no table service but no sign saying so. The noise level is very, very high. When I was there at 7:00 on a Saturday they were out of 2 or 3 beers, including the 2 with lowish ABV, and the rest fell into the 7.5% category, or 7.5++. Now to the clincher, and why I won't be back: The \\"Signature Fresh Charcuterie Plate\\" for $13. What a loser! The meats were good, although minimal, one cheese was like Cracker Barrel although the blue was excellent. And what to put them on? About 1/4 apple, sliced, and three little bits of raisin bread. When I queried about more, I was handed a slice of Nissans (i.e. Wonder Bread) direct from the bag. Sheeesh!

The only thing tougher actually was paying the tab after such a bland meal with semi-atrocious service.\\n\\nFirst, the service was absolutely awful. Our drink order took forever, I was convinced the bar was actually trying to grow the hops and brew the beer on site. To be fair, if a restaurant or bar is swimming in customers I understand that you might have to wait a few moments for service. The Wave however was largely vacant this night, neither the restaurant or the bar were packed or approaching anything near busy. Unfortunately, the service only seemed to get worse from this point forward. All hope that the poor service experience would be washed away by the consumption of an excellent meal was dashed sometime (it felt like hours) thereafter. I can't complain about the cut of lamb only the taste and temperature, it was like someone carved lamb out of lukewarm tofu, it was utterly and direly unremarkable. \\n\\nUtterly and direly unremarkable with a pinch of incompetence seem like an excellent way to actually summarize The Wave recipe overall and end the review.

I would even recommend Eldo's cakes in Chinatown over Yi Soon since they have special order cakes like Mango or the infamous Durian"},{"name":"Pollo Tropical","address":"4235 LaviSta Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"2","text":"What happened?

I found this hotel clean, convenient, and beautiful. I reserved a standard room and the in-room amenities include single-cup coffee maker with coffee and tea, safe, mini fridge, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, Aveeno hygiene items, TV with limited cable channels to include HBO, telephone, and alarm clock. On the 10th floor, I could not hear my neighbors but I could hear noise from the hallway which is typical in hotels. My window view consisted of parking lot construction and they started up around 9am which was definitely noticeable and distracting. Parking will cost you about $22 a day but there is an overflow lot to the right of the hotel that does not charge; however, we were advised to not park there overnight due to theft possibility so I guess park there at your own risk. Unfortunately, I was not able to take advantage of the hotel amenities so I cannot comment but I was aware of outdoor seating areas, plentiful gathering areas in the lobby, on-site restaurant, gift shop, outdoor pool, two hot spa/jacuzzis, and a fitness room. Customer service was all smiles and pleasantries. It was a very nice hotel experience for the exception of the construction but not sure I would pay that high price tag again. That's just me.

My friend swears by it, so we met up for lunch and she took me here.\\n\\nI had the Spicy Chicken Vindaloo which is tender boneless chicken cooked in an exotic blend of spices, fresh tomatoes and vinegar and comes over rice with a choice of one vegetable dish.  I went with the zucchini.  I love when the word exotic is used to describe my food.  It makes me feel like I'm somewhere else.  Ok, no it doesn't but I digress.  The plate was $6.  Are you f'ing kidding me?  All this food for $6?  I haven't taken a bite and I already love this place.\\n\\nSo, the food was plated up and we went to find a seat.  Time to dig in.  Chicken ass nice and tender (as advertised) and the exotic spices are definitely exotic.  Nice heat was building on my tongue which is never a bad thing.  The veggies tasted fresh and the cilantro on top was a nice bonus.  A mango juice and two glasses of water later (yes, I know milk would be better) and the heat was still pouring from my mouth.   Maybe not quite pouring, but you get the image.\\n\\nSo, another good meal in Stumptown for under $10."},{"name":"Viet Flavour Restaurant","address":"1822 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good food.

Our family and friends have been here over 20 times.  It's never been amazing and I've always felt it was overpriced but it's close and usually a fun place for everyone to gather for food, drinks and laughs.  That all changed tonight.  As soon as we walked in, the check in associate was annoyed to have a customer.  We asked if any lanes were open and were told there was a wait.  We put our name on the list and decided to grab some drinks, while our kids played on the arcade games.  I ordered a simple drink while my friend and husband asked the bartender about the beers on tap and wine selection.  He didn't want to give them that information and how dare they ask!!  Several really awkward interactions later, we get our drinks.  We sit and chat for over an hour while lane after lane becomes and remains empty.  We went to check with the front desk to be sure we were still on the waiting list...still on there.  We asked if there was a reason that so many lanes were open...we got a one word response...reservations.  Okay cool.  We continue to wait.  I go back up to the bar to get another drink.  Wait for 20 minutes, as bartender after bartender ignore me.  Finally get a bartender and order the same drink I ordered previously.  I'm going to need to see your id.  I had already provided my id for the first drink and really didn't want to lose my place in line but he insisted.  So off I go, lose my spot and return to show the id.  He then makes my drink.  I hand him cash and he says...um I'm going to need about four more of those.  I said that's a lot more than my last one.  He says you ordered a double...nope definitely didn't. Then he mumbles something and gives me my change.  Never once looked at me.  The kids have come back to the table with all their quarters, as almost every arcade game is out of order.  We sit and watch several people come up to the desk to complain about issues with the lanes.  The staff response was laughable at best.  We finally get a call that our lane is ready and we head to the desk.  The guy at the desk is being unbelievably rude.  Never told us the lane number or gave us shoes.  We just stood there. We finally get through that process and bowl.  That part and only that part went well.  We order garlic knots for the kids and it took them an hour.  Then a pizza comes out...not ours we said and the waitress just rolled her eyes.  The bathroom was disgusting...poopy plungers leaned up against the clogged toilets.  We finish up and head to turn in our shoes.  The guy behind the desk yells something at our kids that we didn't understand.

I saw the manager just stand at the door as people looked around for the rat on the deck, not knowing where it was. He did not put any effort in helping to quiet or handle the situation. The only thing he did was stand there and talk to the hostess. About 10 minutes later he came over to the two girls sitting behind us and apologized to them, \\"sorry, but its the city of Boston,\\" and left not saying a single word to anyone else outside. \\n\\nafter we finally were able to put our food order in, it came out in a reasonable amount of time.

The other new item was the Mediterranean flatbread (see photo). Definitely wouldn't get it again. It was a little dry and a little plain.

I didn't mind the seedy area of town and I found the decor to be kind of charming. Those are the nicest things I have to say about this place. \\n\\nProblem #1. Like I said, I went with a large party. We asked a man ( I assume one of the owners/managers) from the beginning if it would be ok to split up the checks because it is no longer the 90s and everybody carries debit and credit cards. He responded by saying many times that his waiter \\"cannot become a book keeper.\\"  I understand that splitting checks can be extra work, but his response basically meant that he would prefer that we (the paying customers) instead of them (the business being paid to provide a service), should become the book keeper once the final check is given to us. If we pay him and his waiter for a service, why should we have to do the work? I took responsibility for doing the 10 minutes worth of figuring out how to properly split the bill of several hundred dollars between 15 people. This could have all been avoided if he had taken 5 extra minutes and split the checks from the beginning.\\n\\nProblem #2. The food. I ordered a veal dish which was around $20. The menu described the veal as medallions. This means 3 pieces (I'm guessing around 1 ounce each) of chewy veal cut approximately 1/4 inch thick and it was drowning in an overpowering wine sauce. My girlfriend got the shrimp alfredo. The sauce just tasted like thick cream absent of garlic, parmesan and even salt. The garlic bread was mostly burnt. When we were ordering our entrees, the waiter posed the question \\"house salad or Caesar salad?\\" We probably should have read the menu a little more closely because, although his question implied a salad comes with the entree, it is $3.75 extra. The entire table made the same mistake, so it wasn't just a few dummies. I don't mind paying for a salad when I want one, but I wasn't even that hungry and the salad wasn't worth $3.75.\\n\\nProblem #3. Once it was time to settle the checks, I paid using cash to cut down on some of the headache. I handed the waiter my cash which included a 10% tip - which I thought was fair considering the poor service, the charges for the salads we didn't want, and the fact that I had to \\"become a book keeper\\" for the restaurant. The waiter followed us as we left and had the nerve to tell me that the tip was not included and that was not enough tip!\\n\\nLike other people who have commented about the service here, I got the impression that these guys don't give two craps what anybody thinks about how they run their business. People go to this place because of the \\"charm\\" and the pictures of celebs on the wall. Poor service aside, I still wouldn't go back to this place because the food just isn't very good."},{"name":"The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf","address":"13376 N Highway 183, Ste 800","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The coffee is superb.

Your tastebuds will be taken on a journey causing you to be an instant fan of the unsuspected Disney dining experience. Being a somewhat finicky eater had me entering the restaurant with trepidation. To be completely honest, I sat down at my table angered by the dress code (this was my mistake). I didn't read the webpage that detailed the requirements for appropriate dress. Being that I was on a family vacation in Florida, ninety-five degrees, I was wearing dress shorts and a stylish tank top attempting to stay cool in the muggy climate. I made it pass the greater, hostess but was stopped by the manager who politely explained I need to have a shirt with sleeves. This request was totally fair; however, my ego caused my anger. The polite manager provided me with an appropriate button down shirt and sat my family down at the beautiful table surrounded by a themed wilderness ambiance. Like a big child, I pouted because I was being forced to wear a shirt. My ridiculously annoyed face would quickly be deterred once the chef took over to calm my sour demeanor.\\n         \\n     Our waiter provided a less than necessary menu because of the detailed explanation he gave for each dish. My brother was celebrating his birthday which was celebrated by the manager giving us a champagne toast (deliciously served with a large raspberry resting at the bottom of the chilled/bubbly treat). After taking our appetizer order, the waiter delivered a dish he explained was, \\"a warm-up treat made specifically for us by the chef...\\" (we were the first customers of the night). The warm-up was a small white bowl with two pickled beets laying upon a pesto with a star of amazing goat cheese to tip the scales of your tastebuds that are sure to explode. My finicky tongue wanted me to deny my stomach; however, once my mouth embraced this chef's delight, I was instantly sold saying, \\"my God! I'll change my pants too if I can have another bite.\\" Luckily for me, the beet dish was only the beginning. \\n\\n    Each course that followed would raise my love for \\"Artists Point\\" and its wonderful dress code. My brother had an immaculately presented journey of cheeses brilliantly presented on aged oak that once housed a cabernet sauvignon. I cannot describe the dish appropriately because of my lack of cheese knowledge, but I can explain how each cheese was delivered, intercepted by a palette cleanser and punched by a new flavor bringing the appetizer to greater heights. Three in our party enjoyed a buffalo dish, my wife devoured a fresh halibut and  my mouth made love to a filet-minion dressed with roasted potatoes and shallots. \\n\\n     HOLY CRAP! The chef created a medium-well steak (I know I know, too cooked for most) that was perfectly season and melted upon my tongue. I have never been able to slice my steak paper thin. Salt and pepper tingled my entire mouth, juices exploded through each crevice surrounding my teeth and the potatoes/shallots erased the previous bite allowing my mouth to become nostalgic yet instantly reminded of the wonderful bite before. Perfect, absolutely perfect; each family member had nothing but rave reviews for the work of the amazing chef. Even my seven-year-old  daughter exclaimed, \\"this is the best mac and cheese ever,\\" which was made special for her via our waiter's inquisition after seeing she may not really like the other child choices. Now my wife and I would've told her to be happy with the choices provided but the waiter was too quick/devoted to creating happiness for all.\\n\\n    I could continue to tell you about all the amazing flavors but I'm getting hungry and need to stop teasing my mind. Dessert was not needed, but there was no way I would deny myself or my stomach an opportunity to eat another bite deliver by the one of a kind chef. In short (too late) I know why The Wilderness Lodge restaurant is called \\"Artists Point;\\" the chef is a master creator who is obviously devoted to his craft. The chef is an artist who delivers each perfectly presented bite with pin point precision.

The Slumbrew brewing company has teamed up with American Fresh to create a beer garden complete with craft brews, some light meals/snacks, live music, and even a collection of board games to use while hanging out. This is a great outdoor patio bar to enjoy on summer nights. In the cooler months the patio area is contained within a tent and kept comfortably warm with space heaters. I visited this unique little place for the first time over the summer and and enjoyed sampling some of Slumbrew's creations while hanging with friends and admiring some canine pals chilling out near our table. Yes, dogs are welcome here at the beer garden which just adds to its coolness. \\n\\nThis past Saturday my friend and I had tickets to the movies at Assembly Row. We decided to grab dinner first, but did not think to make a reservation earlier in the day. Wait times at most restaurants within the shopping area were just under an hour which left us without enough time to eat before the movie. We were getting hangry and the beer garden was less crowded due to chilly temperatures that night and therefore our best option. The menu offers a few sandwiches in addition to appetizers including pretzels and cheese platters. I ordered a turkey sandwich and my friend decided to fill up on just beer. The sandwich came with a very tiny bowl of cheddar ale soup. I found the sandwich very plain and the soup was a bit disappointing both size and taste-wise. It was, however, fortunate that American Fresh Brewhouse was an option for dinner and helped ease my starvation.  I tried a few sips of the Attic and Eaves ale the other night and found it pretty decent. I definitely would like to come back soon to try more beer. It wasn't until recently I realized there was more to the beer world than Bud Light and I started to expand my craft beer horizons. I'm no expert yet, but working on it. \\n\\nThree and a half stars for this little outdoor hot spot and I can definitely see myself enjoying some more fun times here with friends. I think this is a place that will continue to grow on me and looking forward to trying more of their food and beer."},{"name":"Sushi Katana","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place for sushi, conveniently close to Milenia Mall.

I asked what dark beers they had and was told that the darkest (other than Guiness) was something like a Newcastle Brown and was surprised. Yes, it did say 'ale' house, not 'porter,' or 'stout' house, but I still expected more options since the beer list looked good in terms of size, but I think the list was more on the lighter/IPA/ale/lager side. Still wanted to try something new, so asked our waiter about a few of the beers that I wasn't familiar with and he just said he didn't know anything about those ones.

Menu samplers such as chickpea pakoras, fried chicken, tuna tataki and rice \\"fries\\" were very tasty.  It's probably not going to be everyone's everyday lunch spot, but prices of the regular menu are comparable to Cactus Club or a Joseph Richard Group kind of pub. And let's face it, the UBC community does include more than just students these days, as one thing that has remained constant through the years I've known the place is construction. \\n\\nLuckily, the continual pace of change hasn't touched the UBC Farm, which The Perch says is an integral supplier for their menu. They also source produce and herbs from the rooftop garden directly across from the restaurant, which is run by the AMS garden club, Roots on the Roof.

I've been pretty disappointed so far but after getting a chance to indulge in the coffee here, I have to say this is hands down my favorite independent coffee house in the city.\\n\\nFirst of all, the coffee house is beaming with life. Its located in the Alberta arts district and is nestled near the coop and a bunch of cool, eclectic shops. The people hanging out there as well as the employees were hip, down to earth, and very tolerant of Californians. They have free WiFi, plenty of places to sit (although the seats are super close to each other...so if you're going there, pleeeeeease shower because whoever sits next to you will know whether you did). And if they are as blunt as I, they might bring it to your attention. \\n\\nThe coffee is excellent as well. It is properly extracted, not watered down, made from high quality beans that haven't been burned in the roaster, and is made with so so so so much love!\\n\\nThe staff are incredibly helpful. They went out of their way to wash my mug and pour hot water in it for a few minutes to warm it up before a single drop of coffee hit it. That's service!\\n\\nIt's definitely a place to check out. And attention all independent coffee houses in Portland i've been to (punishing reviews of them to follow soon...lol) and have been disappointed by: go to random order, buy a cup of coffee, drink it, and then taste the coffee you serve.

We had the hardest time deciding on which dirty table to sit at (Flippers obviously doesn't employ a separate busing staff), but we finally settled on one and were greeted within moments by a very friendly server.  After wiping down the table, she took our drink order, but didn't bring us menus until after she brought out our drinks.\\n\\nWe ordered a small tossed salad (which is large enough for two to share), but it is nothing special:  just some iceberg, tomatoes, onions and flavorless croutons.  The house Italian was tasty, though.\\n\\nOur Hawaiian pizza was very basic ... ham and pineapple only.  The amount of cheese and red sauce was adequate.  As far as crust goes, we both came to the same conclusion:  the outside crust was fantastic, but the underside beneath the entire pie was soggy and impossible to eat without a fork and knife.  My partner said he preferred their (outside) crust to Mellow Mushroom's, but I still think MM's, and even Alfonso's, is better.\\n\\nFlippers also has a good selection of specialty pizzas, as well as non-pizza fare like calzones, wings, pastas, and sandwiches; when I go back, I will probably try one of these items rather than the pizza.\\n\\nThose that are consciously child-free out there should take note:  this place seems to be very popular with families, and it can get quite loud.\\n\\nAlso, the decor is sterile-pizza-place-new, and the lighting could be turned down a few notches, but I appreciate their attempt to make it look more interesting than, say, a Pizza Hut."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"TRP is a great restaurant that easily gets a 4 star rating.

We came here b/c I moved to the area and received a few gift certificates. The food isn't bad. For example, our first time there (dinner) the caprese salad was amazing, but when I got it the next time, it was subpar (mozzarella was much harder). Where's the quality control? And the second time was during lunch, so it was way less busy. But though the app was good the initial visit, the fra diavolo special with fried soft shell crab and other seafood was subpar. The crab was good, but there wasn't enough sauce for the pasta, and it also wasn't great (the waitress warned the spice level was medium...umm what Scoville scale was she using because it was so mild and I usually only handle up to medium spice - I guess not in Italian cuisine but Thai/Indian/Korean); I usually love fra diavolo but this lacked flavor. The swordfish, which is easy to overcook, was super rubbery, as if they threw erasers into the dish. The shrimp was also overcooked. It was a HUGE dish so I'll give them that, but I'd rather have less food if it meant a tastier dish. My bf's pork and gnocchi dish was delicious, but so tiny. Apparently they sell desserts to go, but no one's ever at the counter the times I've been there. If you order dessert dining in, however, they'll plate it for you, add a few swirls of sauce and bam, charge you double for it! Overall, it's definitely not worth the amount you're paying for their rent. The worst experience was ordering \\"room service\\" aka they took an elevator, same building, to bring the food up - and charged 20% tip for it. Except I didn't notice they already added the tip, so I gave an extra $10, which meant I paid $20 for a guy in a suit to bring up two boxes of tupperware. How do you do that without informing me? I guess don't pay in cash, b/c had it been card this wouldn't have been an issue. And yes I do care about money when I'm not getting my money's worth.

Later Phil recommended two glasses of wine based on what I said I was looking for and he was spot on with his recommendations - I was very impressed!\\n\\nWe started with the beef tartare and it was very good. There was not quite as much focus on the beef as I prefer (lot's combined into it) but the flavor created was still excellent, just a bit different than anticipated.\\n\\nFor our mains my wife had the full portion of the Gatherer salad which was really good. They use excellent goat cheese and just the whole thing worked. It was awesome. I had the special of the night which was a massive on the bone dry aged steak (I forget the cut now) with a german potato salad. The steak was cooked wonderfully and was very tasty. It maybe could have been finished with a bit more of the salt, but besides that it was excellent - as was the potato salad. \\n\\nWe also ordered the pig tail dessert with is basically pig tailed shaped beignets with cinnamon.

Nearly all east coast pizza beats anything from the midwest, south, etc., but... inconsistencies abound.  It is not unusual to have a great experience one week, and an epic failure a week later.  So this is my first experience with Mama Gina's.  I ordered a thin crust medium/small pizza with three toppings, and a soda.  As a result of experience with numerous pizza delivery places, I made a point of requesting that the crust be fully cooked and the cheese toasty (some places will yank your pizza out prematurely if the delivery driver is ready to run some other orders, but yours isn't quite ready).\\nThe phone man was very polite and informative; the delivery driver was prompt and polite.  The soda was not packaged with or laying on top of my hot pizza (that's a good thing).  The order was correct and cooked properly.  With everything mentioned, I kind of feel bad making any criticisms, but there were two things that could earn that 5th star.  The first was the temperature.    Although it technically qualified as hot, it was really at the lower end of the \\"hot\\" spectrum.  Given my proximity to the restaurant (less than a mile), I was expecting \\"burn my mouth piping hot\\" -- it wasn't.  It was definitely above warm, just not quite far enough.   And the second thing that could be improved is the crust.  It wasn't really bad, but it was a bit inconsistent in thickness, from piece to piece, and it seemed to be too rubbery/chewy.  I'm not an expert pizza chef, but my guess would be that it was either not fresh (light) enough, or that it had been overworked, or both.  However, they did merit 4 stars and a future order -- if the quality never drops, at least they'd be a known commodity, and if they improve, definitely high on my list.  If the quality drops or is inconsistent (sometimes dropping), I'll keep looking for higher quality with the greatest consistency."},{"name":"East End","address":"203 SE Grand Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I suppose I'm just not an East Ender.\\n\\nI don't wear buttons or pins.\\n\\nI don't own a pair of combat boots.\\n\\nMy parents aren't wealthy suburbanites.\\n\\nI don't think Pabst is delicious or worth anything more than a dollar.\\n\\nI don't like looking at girls that remind me of the wenches from a Mad Max or Escape from NY movie.\\n\\nI suppose I'm just not an East Ender."},{"name":"Omaha Steaks","address":"1376 Polaris Parkway","city":"Columbus","stars":"2","text":"Yeah, dont know what was up with the help when we were there today, but they were so unfriendly.

But I digress, the details.. details..\\n\\nThere's 3 stations. At the far right is meat & noodles, in the middle is veggies, and the one on the left is sauces and spices. Make sure to fill 2 cups of sauce, otherwise it wont be enough. 3 cups if you like a lot of sauce, and 4 if you like extra. \\n\\nI've read reviews like 'If you don't like BD Mongolian grill you only have yourself to blame.'

I love using spices and I really enjoy making sauces. I tend to enjoy stir fry. This place has be shaking my head. I have no idea why people like this sh*t!\\n\\nTo begin, the fish was... slimy.  The shrimp were ultra tiny and reaked of fishy rancidness, as did the squid, and scallops. Everything was tiny! Not the tiny you would expect though. So small they literally got lost in the dish. I loaded half my bowl with shrimp, scallops, and squid and after it was cooked I had barely any fish at all to eat; they shrink when cooked obviously. The veggies here are good though, I will give them that. Although the broccoli was so large, and they dont give you knives, that I couldnt eat it. \\n\\nLong story short, we got our meal for free since it was just so bad. The sauces all tasted weird (we tested them first), the fish was going bad, and the cooks over cooked everything they touched. We still had a coupon so we figured we'd give it one more shot. This time we would stay clear of the fish!\\n\\nI had steak & chicken w/ fajita sauce. Terrible! The meat was so over cooked it was physically painful to swallow it! The sauce, which was ok when i sampled it, was terrible once cooked. I ate what I could, mostly the veggies, and we made another trip. My husband tried the steak and chicken as well and had the same problem I did. He had the bd BBQ sauce and it was 'ehhh'. I got myself some steak and chicken and the bd bbq sauce and headed over one more time, hoping this time would be better. I also added egg this time, 2 of them.

I mean, dangerous for me, it being so close and my weight management difficulties being what they are. And dangerous for RM because they're in the Shopping Center of Doom, where good local businesses go to die.  Let's hope that they're the ones to break the cycle.\\n\\nSo, the meat should be the focus, and as such a little extra weight goes to that in my rating. I ordered the brisket platter, with two sides: fried okra and baked beans. I'm not completely sold on the sides, but I didn't dislike them - I would order them again.  They just seemed... maybe a little generic. I liked the brisket -- there was a lot of it in the platter, and it was very tender. If I'm nitpicking, it wasn't as smoky as I had hoped, and the preparation didn't lend itself to a very distinct flavor. The wide variety of sauces available makes for an acceptable workaround. To be fair, 4R is guilty of the same with their brisket if you ask me. I do love sauces, so it's not a big deal, but I like a brisket with bold flavors in the rub, and a good long smoke to really let the flavor soak in.\\n\\nAnyway, the people are friendly and the restaurant looks really clean (although I got takeout on my visit). The punch card they offer is good for a free sandwich after 10 punches, which is a nice added benefit.\\n\\nOverall a big, tasty meal at a reasonable price.

The waiter shuffled towards us with an air of agitation and was vocally unhappy that we had sat at the table before it was cleared. I was perhaps too blunt when I told him that we had been told to sit at the tables even if they were messy and he met my statement with a sassy \\"oh really?\\". It was about 5 mins later a woman with blond hair stormed out of a back room and yelled at me that she did not tell us to do that and then stormed away. My partner was utterly let down and before leaving I told the waiter I thought he was very rude, that the woman who yelled at us was not the person who told us we could sit at a messy table, and that I questioned the integrity of this establishment.

Thank you, Yelpers, for leading us to Barbara! Their happy hour runs from 5-7 and is only in the bar area, which has ample seating. $4 glasses of red sangria? Absolutely. Between my friend Sarah and I, we sampled half the menu. Even though it seemed a little weird to be ordering crudo at a Tapas bar, the yellowtail jack was my absolute favorite - 3 generous pieces of yellowtail with micro greens and a citrus vinaigrette - super simple and fresh and totally worth the $8 happy hour price tag. Sarah had the flank steak with chimichurri and fries, which was a little more well done than I usually prefer, but the flavor was amazing and the fries were seasoned and on point! The daily paella was perfectly cooked in the cutest mini paella pan and had the requisite layer of crunch at the bottom - I was definitely a fan. If there was one dish I'd probably skip, it was the ceviche. The shrimp was great, but the octopus was super tough and rubbery. And even though we were stuffed (hey, we're on vacation!), we ordered the crema Catalana and the manchego cheesecake, and both were super decadent and came with he cutest little wine pairings. Though I don't usually order creme brulee at restaurants, the creme catalan here was amazing - it was a little lighter than the usual, but still creamy and had a great ginger flavor to it - I'm drooling just thinking about it! Overall, 4 glasses of sangria, 6 tapas, and 2 desserts plus wine pairings ran us about $70, which was a steal for this great service and qualiry of food.

I ordered the three sausage platter with saurkraut and I was pleasantly surprised. I am usually disappointed when I order saurkraut at restaurants because they typically just take it out of the jar. Here they cooked it right with brown sugar, caraway seeds, juniper berries, etc.  Just like our home recipe. Everything else was great, and they probably have the best sausages money can buy in this part of the world. It is difficult to find good Northern European food in Mass., and we will definitely be coming back on a regular basis.

No smoking inside until 9:00 so families with kids or whatever can eat which is fine, because I only sit inside if I have to. Try the old fashioned calzone - it's about the size of a large pizza folded in half, stuffed with the most amazing combination of melty, gooey cheese. I always get tomatoes and mushrooms in it and it's perfect (perfectly unhealthy as well, I'm sure). They have trivia night on Friday, which I find odd because it gets so busy, I'd rather listen to music than questions about trivial stuff (see what I did there). They also have bingo and other random themed nights. (It seems like every Tuesday I want to go, and alas I remember they are closed on Tuesdays...whhhhhyyyyy???).

We were on a mission!\\n\\nOctopus - so good we ordered a second round\\nOrder of jamon Iberico - lives up to its food porn reputation\\nBoquerones - do not fear the anchovy, those tiny fish are delish!\\nCeviche - such delicious seafood in this one, do it!\\nSeafood Canelones - this ain't your average stuffed canelone, fantastic!\\nCheese plate - so much variety, oh my!\\nRomaine - we needed some greens, and these were tasty\\nTortilla Espanola with potatoes - my favorite of the two tortas\\nTortilla Espanola with chorizo - wonderfully eggy\\nMixed Seasonal Vegetables - seriously, one of my favorite dishes of the evening\\n\\nSomewhere around here, the executive chef/owner came out to our table exclaiming he had to see which table was ordering all but 1/4th of the menu!  Then he applauded our gusto.  Hey, we like good food!  Plus, in all reality, when split amongst six people each of the above totaled about a bite meeeebbbbe two if you stretched it. \\n\\nPerdiz al ajillo - tiny little quail bird too cute to eat.  Not!\\nClams with chorizo - we love our chorizo!\\nGrilled lamb brochette - perfectly cooked protein and wonderful flavor\\nPigs feet terrine - scary name, awfully good flavor.  Get this!\\nBraised oxtail - comfort food all the way\\n\\nAt this point, we all started questioning our resolve.  The two big guns on their way and we were reaching our fill point.  Then out they came...\\n\\nArros negre - I don't know what it is about squid ink, but something about it made this dish just divine.\\nFideua - not your abuelita's fideo.  So much subtle flavor here.  Good stuff.\\n\\nBut we weren't done yet, folks!  Being the good foodies that we are, we called upon the secret dessert compartment and it was ready.  The owner was kind enough to bring out all our desserts and gave us the run-down on what region of Spain they come from.  Loved that!\\n\\nMel I Mato - delicious goat cheese mousse!\\nA Mallorcan pastry served with a grapefruit granita, divine\\nAnd an almond cake served with a delicious ice cream and blueberry compote - be still, ,my beating heart!\\n\\nHe also brought us a gift of a cava porron.  He asked if we'd ever done a beer bong, all nodding their heads as if to say, 'duh!'  Then he said it was like a fancy beer bong.  A wine bong!  And he gave us a demo on how it's used.  This provided much hilarity at the end of our meal with cava down the blouse, up the nose, money shots.  You get the hang of it after a few tries, though.  \\n \\nAll in all, a fantastic meal complete with fantastic service.  Barlata is hot, hot, hot these days.

We met some friends for dinner here the other day who had been before. Their thoughts before we went, \\"it was good and quality last time but some dishes were so-so.\\" After eating, \\"man, they have really stepped up their game. Everything was excellent.\\" \\n\\nYes, everything we had was excellent and we tried a large portion of the menu. What I loved is every dish was prepared perfectly and carried it's own weight at the table. No dish lacked, which was might impressive. \\n\\nHere is what we tried. I would recommend all of them!\\nFirst, drinks really quick:\\n-  White Walker ($11) - Dolin Blanco Vermouth, Ford's Gin, Club Soda) - a near perfect drink in my opinion. I don't like things sweet. This was refreshing but the vermouth gave it a nice complexity. \\n\\n- Bee's Knees ($10) - very nice drink as well. The honey gave it some sweetness but not too much. Still refreshing. \\n\\n- Fig Old Fashion ($12) - great take on an old fashioned. Not over the top frills which is good in an old fashioned. \\n*I didn't order all of these, I tried everyone's at the table. Just a disclaimer so you didn't think I was wasted and elaborating on the food review)\\n\\nSecond, Food...oh the amazing food:\\n- Baby squid / fennel sausage / squid ink ($10) - I haven't had a place properly do a squid ink dish in years. Barlata knocked it out of the park. The portion is two baby squid stuffed with a delicious sausage and a rich, well spiced squid in sauce. Ask you server for extra bread because if you're like us you'll be wanting to lick the can. Bread is the more publicly acceptable approach.  \\n\\n- Bravas ($8 - FriedÔøΩ?potatoes / spicy tomato / allioli) - I was shocked how good they could make a simple potato. The dressing were excellent and potatoes fried perfectly. Perfect dish to help fill you up during tapas but keep you impressed all at the same time. \\n\\n- Grilled Shitake Mushrooms (9)- holy hell, who knew a mushroom could be so good. This one is a tapas dish with Asian flair of sake and mirin, but man my mouth is watering again just thinking about these. Serving is two skewers of halved mushrooms. \\n\\n- Fire Roasted Shishito Peppers ($8) - again, another simple but executed perfectly dish. Lightly salted and perfectly roasted. \\n\\n-  Brandada ($11) - I'd never had this dish before but so glad I tried it based on our friends recommendation. It's a kind of whipped potato souffle with shredded salted cod mixed throughout. It was new and delicious. \\n\\n- Boquerones ($8) - a perfectly layered dish of flavors. I was a little intimiated by the anchovies not having had too many before, but the pear and cheese with the salty fish....mmmmm heaven. \\n\\n- House Cured Salmon ($12) - heaven on a plate. Buttery tender salmon cured perfectly and topped with a delicious creme.\\n\\n- Gambas Ajillo ($13) - simple and delicious. Shrimp cooked to perfection. Another one to ask for extra bread because that garlicy oil left behind in divine! \\n\\n- Croquetas Of Jamon Iberico and Serrano ($8.5) - I've never had croquetas as superb as these. Little bites of heaven. They have forever ruined me for crappy croquetas. \\n\\n- Order of jamon Iberico ($19) - our friends said this was a must have. It's a special type of jamon (prosciutto) where the pigs are only fed acorns. This is one of the best jamon items I've ever had. Just meaty enough with a melt in your mouth quality. There I go drooling again. \\n\\nLastly, desserts:\\n- Hojaldre de Pera ($9) - fantastic and great for sharing. Comes with two generous sized pockets you could cut in half in need be. And the Valdeon & Fig Ice Cream - no words, just a happy face. \\n\\n- Blackberry & Mezcal Sorbet ($6) - unique and flavorful. Almost had a hint of spice to it. Definitely worth trying. \\n\\n- Meyer Lemon Sorbet ($6) - tart, bright and palate cleansing. \\n\\nAs you can see, we tried to eat the whole menu! I was impressed that each dish seemed to get better and better. My advice is to go with at least four people so you can try a variety of dishes. \\n\\nI was so impressed, I plan to go back to see if their paella can hold up to the rest of the menu."},{"name":"Claudiana Italian Restaurant","address":"8475 Sancus Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The food is amazing here!

It was a daily battle. I've been to every location here in Austin and still get excited when I find a coffee shop that sells their tacos.But this one is by far my favorite! People are generally friendly no matter which TD you're at, but the service at this location is impeccable. I come to this location an embarrassing amount of times a week despite the TD on Lamar being closer to my work, because of the service. If there is ever an issue or if I come in grumpy (which happens) the manager is right on top of it doing all he can to please the customer. \\n\\nThere is also more parking at this location compared to all of the other locations, which is a big deal in this city. And not usually the ridiculous line that you'll definitely see at Lamarlocation. Their morning crew is amazingly fast, usually getting me in and out just in time for work. The outdoor patio is also a major bonus to this location. The cute little picnic tables outside are perfect for weekend hangover tacos with friends.\\n\\nI shouldn't even have to explain why the food is delicious, if you haven't had Tacodeli yet I don't know where you've been your whole life. \\n\\nFaves: Bean and Cheese w/ Avy, Jess Spesh and Papas EC\\n(Their lunch tacos are great too, I'm just typically a breakfast taco girl)\\nDona sauce is life, Roja sauce is life's partner\\n\\nPeople will complain about the prices here, yet spend $3 on a shitty breakfast sandwich anywhere else.

The waitstaff is always incredibly friendly and I love the atmosphere - it's built out of an old bank, and you can actually sit in the bank vault that's still in the back, and they have a quaint outdoor patio.

We stopped in for a couple drinks of a Thursday afternoon.  The cocktails were excellent.  I had the Big Ern, which was bourbon based, but really carried by the array of bitters in the drink, giving it a fruity twist to go with the bourbon kick (I wish I could find the cocktail menu on their website so I could describe exactly what was in it).  My wife had a peach walnut whiskey sour, if I recall correctly, which was also very good.  The entire cocktail list looked fantastic, and if they were as good as our two drinks, I'll definitely go and try some more.  Drinks were in the $10-12 range, but the quality was worth it.  I reached the bottom of my glass a little too quickly and wish they were a tad bigger, but they are fairly sized. \\n\\nThere's also a quality draft list, and we switched to beer after a cocktail each to keep our heads on straight.  Bodhi, Three Floyds, and other quality choices, many of which were local.\\n\\nThe food menu is small, but the little food we had was great.  We split the poutine.  One of the best poutines I've had in Columbus, if not the best.  Rich and flavorful meat and gravy.  Gooey cheese.  There are a number of bar snacks/appetizers that sounded delicious, and I look forward to trying the cheese curds next time.  Entrees are fairly limited, but this is really more of a bar than a restaurant and I was just happy to have something to snack on while I drank.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the space.  It could not look more different than Surly Girl did when it was in the space.  It's bright with soft green colored walls and intricate paneling.  Tons of detail work.

After some repeated conversations she finally figured out that one of their workers accidentally deleted it. When I asked if they could give us a discount on our morning catering because they screwed up the lunch catering the manager said \\"nope.\\" They could give us a discount on our next order. Why in the world would we order again if our initial experience was crap and the manager continually argued that the fault was on our end? Not to mention the food was sub par at best.

The resort fee was $25 per day- I opted out of this as it appeared to be a waste of money given what you received in return, which wasn't much. Starbucks was awesome.

Of course you wanted to like the place - if your intention was not to like the place, then you really shouldn't be going there to begin with. That being said, the vast majority of the other comments are spot on: the sandwiches are novel in theory, but poorly executed and exorbitantly overpriced. On the bright side, at least it's not Little Azio's.\\n\\nFood: Villains Wicked Heroes is a northern influenced sub shop with approximately a dozen different offerings named after infamous villains. I opted for the \\"Odd Job\\", which consisted of Korean fried chicken (twice fried), gochjang \\"buffalo\\" sauce, and pear slaw. Although the flavor profile sounded stellar, the delivery was less than impressive. The bread here is good, but it severely overpowers the other ingredients - the sub was nearly devoid of meat. To make matters worse, the sides are limited and the available options are littered with some horrifyingly obscene ingredients, including kale, charred tofu, peas, and radishes. All I have to say is WTF, get some house made chips for those with a digestive tract and no desire to eat like a small woodland creature. \\n\\nService: Orders are placed at the front counter, patrons are given a number to place at their table, and the food is brought out once it's prepared. Drinks are self-serve on one of the smallest fountain drink dispensers that I've ever encountered. Overall, the staff were all professional, but they didn't really go out of their way to make patrons feel welcome - it was like they felt they were doing us a favor by allowing us to enter.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior of this place is lightyears away from its previous incarnation. It's mildly reminiscent of the love child between a high school geeks basement lair and a neglected subway station. However, I will say that the bar area is one of the crowning amenities  - it's  a walk-up bar that opens up to the patio and can be accessed from the sidewalk. However, in the end, this place doesn't really fit in Midtown - I could see it as more of an Edgewood or Little 5 hot spot. \\n\\nCost: I understand that this place is subject to Midtown rent, but the quality and quantity of the offerings are not commensurate with the price. Each sub costs approximately $8-$11, sans any side or drink. Once you add on a side ($3) and a drink ($2), you're looking at a $13-$16 bill before tax and tip that really should have only been around $10. \\n\\nOther: Villains Wicked Heroes is located in the 903 Peachtree complex, the single story strip of businesses that includes Noodle and the now defunct Lime Mexican Taqueria. Limited parking is available in the plaza's small lot, but you'll have a higher likelihood of finding viable and free parking on nearby Juniper or Piedmont Streets."},{"name":"Olmecas Mexican Restaurant","address":"2121 E Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Every \\\\time I go here with my girl we get very good service and the food is just what we are looking for.

So advice to upper management and owner treat your employees better as far as respect, pay, and all other aspects and make sure there is enough coverage to for each position so returning customers (who are drawn in by descent food) to not have to wait on the phone or in line to pick up there order. Now you have happy customers who will put down better reviews and recommend you guys, leading to more total revenue, leading to more staff for covering positions, that just one person shouldn't be held accountable for, leading to happier employees and less turnover.

They don't even try on the fries, and when you ask for cajun seasoning on them they just throw it all on the center without even trying to spread it a bit.\\n\\nAll that aside, MAYBE this place would be worth it if the staff was nice, out of sheer convenience to so many students. But that isn't even slightly the case, and I'm referring to the manager in particular. Half the workers there are student, so they're pretty apathetic and just do what they're told which isn't really a problem, unless your boss is cheap and rude like the manager at Wingnuts is. One small example is their deal on Wednesdays, where they give half a pound of wings free if you buy a pound or more. Wingnuts stays open until pretty late, past midnight, but apparently if you come on Tuesday night past midnight, making it WEDNESDAY, the deal doesn't apply? Yet if you're 5 minutes past midnight on Wednesday, it's too late. \\n\\nYea no, this place sucks.

They seated us in about 30 minutes and we had the most pleasant waitress, Adrianna, who took our order right away. If she was mad about working on Easter, you wouldn't have guessed it. She was perky and friendly and even got on the same level as the kids as they ordered. She commended their ability to order quickly and noted that tables of twelve adults didn't order as clearly and quickly as they did. Even with kids shuffling around while the order was being prepared, she remembered everyone's meal once it came out.

I have often ordered the ravioli - a mainstay in several varieties - from the appetizer menu at a price point of about $9, and as a $9 appetizer I'm perfectly content to receive two generously-sized ravioli on a plate.  When ordering the $18 ravioli entree, however, I expected more than two mouthfuls...especially given that they were VEGETARIAN ravioli and priced tantamount to several protein options on the menu. My party complained, which I am loathe to do, and after some haggling they agreed to take 2 of the 4 ravioli orders we'd placed off the menu, but not without being made to feel our complaint was out of left field.\\n\\nI'll stick with Washington Square Tavern...I've never experienced anything but extraordinary customer service there."},{"name":"Something Healthy Wholesome Meals & Juice Bar","address":"660 Abbott Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"YES.

Our food arrived and the bread was still MIA. I asked the waiter about the bread, \\"oh, that rarely ever comes out\\" well make sure its not on the bill if that's the case.

She is currently 13 months old, so I can speak to both the infant 1 room and infant 2 room (which is also a toddler transition room).  \\n\\nMy child feels very loved by her teachers, and that is the most comforting thing for my husband and I.  They play with her and sing and dance with her.  As a first time mom, I'm very involved in her daily life and routine, and I always make sure to ask about her day when I pick her up.  Her teachers are kind and responsive and have a good handle on all of the kids in the room.\\n\\nI feel the need to respond to a few of the prior reviews.  \\n\\nFor one, I never feel like a $$ to anyone in this center.  This daycare is definitely one of the cheaper options in the area, so if they wanted to only make money off of you, they are doing a bad job at it.  They could raise their rates by hundreds more each month and still be in the middle of the boat.  \\n\\nAt drop-off and pick-up, you might find the infants in the same room, but there are always the appropriate number of teachers in the room to look after the children.  \\n\\nI never saw shoes worn in the infant 1 room - and I'm very particular about this (again - first-time mom).  Staff and parents take their shoes off or put slippers on.  Shoes can be worn in the infant 2 room since most of the kids are walking and it's a toddler transition room as well.\\n\\nKids get sick at daycare.  Workers get sick at daycare.  From the kids most likely!  It ends up benefiting children to be exposed to these germs - they'll have perfect attendance in kindergarten!  \\n\\nI've never experienced anyone \\"forgetting\\" to feed my child.  In the Infant 1 room, children get fed based on need (not a schedule).  In Infant 2, the kids eat all together at set times, which helps them transition to the toddler room (and for life in general).  \\n\\nCubbies for both rooms have always been fine.  Temperatures in the room always fine.  \\n\\nAs far as curriculum goes for Infant 1... that room is designed for INFANTS!  What do you want to do with (at most) 9 month olds?  They have plenty of toys, and let's face it, everything is entertainment to them.  Including the teachers - my child belly laughs by just playing games and interacting with them.  Which is the best kind of learning for her at this age.  Again, I ask the teachers about my daughter's day on a daily basis, and I love to hear that they did arts & crafts or went for a walk, etc., and I would like to hear that more often.  But that's for me.  Not necessarily for her.  In Infant 2 room, they do a lot more with the kids in terms of curriculum.   \\n\\nI exclusively breastfed my daughter for her first year, and I'm VERY particular about her breast milk bottles (anyone who made it a year pumping at work - 2 TIMES A DAY - knows what I'm talking about).  I label my bottles at home (before I bring them to daycare) and I've never had a problem with them.  If anything, the teachers follow the rules very closely, so sometimes, if my daughter didn't finish all of her bottle, they toss the milk (according to the rules).  Which makes me cry but I understand why the teachers did it.  When the kids get older, they do hold their own bottles to feed themselves.  That's a good thing!  \\n\\nI have also gone in to nurse her on occasion, so I see what happens on a random day at a random time.  I've never seen any staff acting in any way that would be unclean, including washing their hands or around meal time or bottles.  \\n\\nI don't know about the violation of kids sleeping in seats on the ground... but babies fall asleep in lots of places... including cribs, swings, etc.  \\n\\nI looked at yelp reviews for daycares too, so there should be more of them so we can all make an educated decision on where to send our babies when they are not with us!"},{"name":"Five Horses Tavern","address":"535 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Really good draft list, more sours than IPA's and I love that.

The place was nicely decorated and reminded me of a restaurant I had eaten in Palo Alto.  Our server was really great and gave good recommendations on both food and drink.  The food had nice presentation, for sure, but I have to say that the flavors weren't all there.  Maybe it's bc California has many organic, farm-to-table restaurants, but Orlando doesn't?  I would give it three stars for food but I added a star for service.  We ordered:\\n\\n-Creekstone Ribeye Tartare - I'm a fan of raw beef, though I still don't care for raw fish.  I liked the succulent beets that came with the dish, but we thought it would have been better had we been given chips or something to eat the beef with.  It was, for us, a bit much to eat the raw beef basically on it's own, though it was seasoned.  \\n-Atlantic Swordfish - This was a nice piece of fish, but my friend thought the bean mix that came with it overpowered the flavor of the fish.  She wasn't a big fan of her dish.  Go figure.  \\n-Pork Porterhouse - A very tender piece of pork with little fat!  I barely finished half of it! I did wish the pork had more sauce (or sauce on the side), though.  I loved the collared greens that came with it - it had a very sweet taste to them.  Seriously delicious.  \\n-Lemon Tart - Small slice of lemon curd and meringue.  I wasn't blown away by dessert, though it was good.  I remember loving a similar dessert (key lime, not lemon, though) at Morton's many years ago.  Came with a small cookie crisp.\\n\\nWe each ordered two drinks.

Portion was generous, and Im sure would've been better had it been freshly made and not cold. The omelette station is wonderful, and they do have egg whites.  For my second course I had the tuna tartare -  wonderful.  One of our dinners ordered the crepe au fromage and jambon - that was a delightful hit, although I wasn't too convinced with the diced sliced ham - Im sure they can work on something a bit more sophisticated than dicing the sliced ham they use for the charcuterie display.  As for the steak and eggs - meat was perfectly prepared, BUT the hash browns and eggs were COLD.  We ate nonetheless, I guess it was because we were distracted by discussion, but otherwise I would've sent that back.\\n\\nThe dessert cart is more impressive than it is in flavor.  Mini tartlets and eclairs are beautifully displayed, no the most impressive I've had.  Quite frankly, if they got their pastries from Madrid in Marlborough, that would really put a spin on their dessert tray.  The mini mousse are nice nonetheless.\\n\\nI was surprised not to see an assortment of pate's on display, given that it is a French restaurant, and the brie served encroute and warm - that would actually push it up a notch to meet the price tag for the brunch...\\n\\nPricey at $32.00 per person, but I will definitely give them another chance at a later date - this time I will give them a heads up instead of blind them with a YELP, and see if its better.  Service is THE highlight of the restaurant.  The manager, server and chefs are approachable even though it is a sophisticated and elegant setting that caters to MONEY (which I don't have!) very pleasant, willing to please (so speak up, I was too busy!), lovely.  Im sure they would've corrected the issues had I mentioned it, but as I said, I was too busy with other things.\\n\\nIf you are trying to impress business associates or your in-laws - this is an elegant and beautifully set brunch setting.\\n\\n(I have had their mussles and frites in the evening - those are WONDERFUL)"},{"name":"Yokohama Teppanyaki","address":"12251 Number 1 Road, Suite 140","city":"Richmond","stars":"2.5","text":"It's saving grace was its' location and great parking. \\n\\nWe so wanted to like this restaurant but it was a fail from the moment we walked in.

We both liked the mushroom broth better.  We went through the menu and chose the meats and vegetables we wanted to try and luckily, the person who took our order told us we had ordered too much, so we cut a couple of dishes out.

The cheese is the yellow slightly cheese-sauce variety, the rice and beans are standard variety (no surprises). It's essentially comfort food for Texans. And when it's done right, it is amazingly tasty and satisfies a particular craving!\\n\\nSecond, Louie G is spot on regarding the ambiance of the place.  It's old school, rural Texas restaurant style.  Kinda like what you'd expect to find in Llano, Jarrell, Taylor, etc... probably because Rosie's has been around since Austin was almost that small.\\n\\nAnyway, the wife and I stopped there for the first time the other day.  I have to admit, we almost walked out after we saw the inside.  It is, as I mentioned, *very* old school and rural feeling.  But I am SO glad we didn't.  The servers were very friendly, and our waiter suggested a Chicken Chile Relleno when I asked about what was good... and it was very, very good.  Simple TexMex style for sure, but the execution was great.  Big fat poblano stuffed, breaded and fried with chicken and cheese.  Usually, I'm wary of Chile Rellenos with any red sauce, because they typically are watery and ruin the texture of the fried part.  But this was not a problem with Rosie's.  My wife had a combo enchilada and tamale plate she also said was very good.  The guacamole was fresh and light on the salt (best way to serve it, IMO, cause you can always add salt).  Chips were some of the best I've tasted at any TexMex place.\\n\\nAs we were leaving, the lady behind the counter (you pay at the register) gave us a free cookie/candy of some sort of gingerbread variation.  It was incredible.  Don't know what it was called, but I highly recommend.\\n\\nAbout the only thing I'd ding Rosie's on is the price.  It's typical for the neighborhood now (right across from HC Galleria), but it's a bit high for the style of the place.  Still reasonable, though, with most things under $9."},{"name":"The Wave... of American Flavors","address":"4600 N World Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Many folks say this is one of the best kept secrets of Disney breakfast buffets.

Tender, juicy, bursting with flavor and seasoned just right with salt/pepper before cooking.  The mashed potatoes were the best we've ever eaten too.  The mushrooms were 'normal' but very good.\\n\\nWe don't mind paying a hearty price for a totally satisfying meal - and we left 100% happy and planning a return trip!!

I ignored the lack of comfort and stickiness since the food could be really good.\\n\\nThe pan fried pork dumplings had some soup inside which isn't the case for a lot of other restaurants, but there was only a small amount of meat. It did have decent flavours, but it lacked the meat filling.\\n\\nThe spiced smoked fish was served cold and I wished that it was specified on the menu for those who are unfamiliar with this dish. It tasted sweet with flavours of soy sauce and rice wine. The fish reminded of dace fish which has a hard crusty texture. Also, there were lots of bones. \\n\\nThe saut√©ed shredded beef with mantou buns was specified as spicy on the menu, but it turned out to be sweet! There should be more mantou buns as it did go well together with the beef.\\n\\nThe hot and sour soup was unremarkable. It was not hot enough and they should have added more mushrooms, tofu, bamboo shoots. I made better hot and sour soup for my first try in high school grade 11 Food and Nutrition class.\\n\\nThe braised free run chicken tasted bland, unless you dip it in the Huadiao rice wine which was present at the bottom of the dish.\\n\\nThe pancake with vegetables and minced pork was nicely pan fried with nice light flavours of vegetables and pork. However, in order to get the full pancake, you must order two portions which the server did, so I received four pieces. \\n\\nThe steamed rice with vegetables with salted meat barely had any meat, but the rice had a nice texture. I did appreciate that the dish wasn't overly salty."},{"name":"Vanbarry's Public House","address":"4120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Local joint for my family.

My husband and I tried this place for the first time last night for restaurant week, and we both really enjoyed it. \\n\\nThe restaurant is very romantic feeling, with lots of wood, some chandeliers, and mirrors, but it is mostly divided into small booths which also offer privacy to the diners.

Looking at other servers they seemed to be great as well. The plating was also very appetizing and enhanced the meal nicely. \\n\\nThe bread, by the way, was delicious.

We were served a nice sized loaf and given two butters- a regular one and a house-made pastrami butter, which we tried but did not particularly care for. \\n\\nI started with the crab bisque, which was so delicious!! I think it had cilantro in it which surprised me- this was the first time I have been so pleasantly surprised with new flavor combinations in awhile. My husband had the wedge salad, which looked pretty typical but according to him had too much dressing. \\n\\nMy entree was the scallops which again were amazing. The portion was generous and they were pan seared and served over a lobster risotto, which was garnished with fennel.

I don't know about you, but when I'm sick the last thing I want to do is expend energy chewing my food--a reason why congee is such good sick food--and this dish is the perfect solution! The braised noodles were so soft and the chicken and bok choy were diced into small pieces. You could practically be toothless and eat this! (Something to keep in mind for when I get old...) It had the perfect ratio of noodles to chicken and bok choy (i.e. there were lots of chicken and bok choy), so you're sure to get a little of each in every bite. I also loved the soft crunch of the bok choy, which provided some textural contrast.\\n\\nCurious about what the \\"HOMEMADE-STYLE CAKE\\" was, we asked our server. She described it as a green onion pancake with pork floss (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/sNDfYZP9OYypywbi33aSxw?select=5-UVWTGlr4V55O46k2D3Sg), which sounded delicious so we ordered it. This was just ok. There was a decent amount of green onions but I could barely tell there was pork floss in it. I liked the textures--crispy outside, chewy inside--though.\\n\\nLastly, with a little bit of room left in our tummys, we added an order of the SALTY GLUTINOUS RICE WRAP (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/sNDfYZP9OYypywbi33aSxw?select=gXEQBPeJwKrzE575VCZuHQ), mostly to see how it compares with the ones I grew up eating at Cantonese restaurants. The pork filling was tender and the rice, flavoured with soy sauce (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/sNDfYZP9OYypywbi33aSxw?select=Pzs8E412udmk768eu3A5IQ), was salty and had a nice soft chewy texture. It was pretty good but I still prefer the sticky rice wraps with mung beans and salted egg yolk.\\n\\nUnfortunately I couldn't end my meal with an authentic Shanghainese dessert--not because I couldn't cram anything more into my belly but because we were told their kitchen was too busy to make dessert. Kind of a BS excuse if you ask me. Oh well, next time...\\n\\nOne tip: MAKE RESERVATIONS!

Given, we didn't wait the 20 minutes for a table, we ordered to go and sat on the bench in front of the dry cleaners next door.  First spring weather of March this year, gorgeous.

Ridconculous. Plain and simple. Crispy baguette, obviously home made roast pork, ham, cheese, shredded lettuce, a good helping of pickles, tomatoes, cheese, mayo and mustard dripping out of the sandwich and down onto my hands. On the ground. Everywhere. That's a Cuban. In fact, other than the wait, my only complaint is that there wasn't quite enough meat. I am a carnivore to the fullest definition of the term. \\n\\nI compare all Cuban's to the one I had on Vieques, Puerto Rico. These two dudes, from Boston if I remember correctly, set up a shop in one of the border towns and served up Cuban's the size of my head.

Put two enormous slices of bread loaded with at least two pounds of meat and slather in mayo and mustard with melted cheese and pickles and you have what I call a Cuban. No I've never had one in Miami or Cuba. This thing was actually preposterous. Call me spoiled but that's the image and taste I have in my mind when I order a Cuban - I have yet to find a match stateside. \\n\\nThe mofongo, crispy, delicious, red fatty garlic sauce.

However, the last time we were in she ordered a bagel with cream cheese and we discovered far too late that the cost of cream cheese is the SAME as another bagel! That's right- it costs just as much to top a bagel as to buy a second bagel! who's idea was that? That's price gouging at a terrible level. So I know we'll never buy one of those again!\\nSecondly, the gal making our drinks had zero focus. We had ordered one of the boxes of coffee, that she made promptly, but we also ordered a large hot tea, extra cream extra sugar. When she handed us the box of coffee she hadn't made the tea, and then stood looking at us like we should go away now. My wife pointed out we had a tea on the order, she looked confused and asked what kind, my wife says \\"large hot tea, extra cream, extra sugar\\" the woman made a medium tea, nothing in it and handed it to us. we said no, LARGE,  not medium. so she dumped it into a large cup and tried to hand it back. WITHOUT adding more tea!

They also don't have the standard servings (Get Sum - over pay for 2 egg custards, Anywhere else - pay less for 3 custards). Overall, if you want to come here: try the salt and pepper tofu. Don't get the specials - they're nothing special.

But since I won't likely be coming back, I thought I may as well recount my experience.\\n\\nWe came for the happy hour which features half-off appetizers and dollar-off beers. We had the spinach & artichoke, quesadillas, & chicken fingers. Split three ways, it certainly filled us up. I had a couple of beers as well. Something aged in a whiskey barrel (interesting!) and something else... They have a decent selection of beers, but I do remember struggling to find something (i.e., I wasn't all tha-at impressed with the selection). All-in-all, everything was average. Nothing stuck out as being too good nor too bad! Well, except for one thing, and it went like this...\\n\\nOur check came and we scrounged for cash from our wallets, plus some extra for the tip. I think we ended up throwing down a 10% tip--we weren't really paying attention. Shortly after taking our money our server returned with the extra change we left, and a scowl. He said, \\"Here's your X dollars back\\", and glared at us as he walked away. He sat down next to another server and talked at her while continuing to glare at us. Oops! Well, at least two of the three of us at the table have been servers before--we felt empathetic.  so we searched our pockets for change enough to bump the tip to 20% (a couple dollars). He must have heard the ruffling of dollar bills and the sound of loose change in our pockets because he came back all smiles and said, \\"It would have been about double that\\", and walked away with a few dishes, still smiling. What he meant was that had it not been happy hour, our bill would have been much more, i.e., his tip would have been much more. Thanks for justifying your actions, buddy.\\n\\nWhy I don't hate the guy: having been a server, it really does piss me off when people tip poorly. And it really sucks that I got caught on the other side of the table this time. He was unobtrusive, attentive, and cheery--so I felt terrible when he pointed out that we didn't tip him \\"properly\\". As a server, I remember being in his same situation so many times and only wishing there was something that I could do to let the cheap-o customers know how...cheap they were. If only I had the balls to do what this guy did...\\n\\nWhy I'll not come back: after much thought about this whole situation, I've completely ridden myself of any guilt for tipping \\"poorly\\". I sort of wish I would have just taken the tip back from the change tray, walking out and saying to the server, \\"10% is a lot better than 0%\\". You get good and bad customers, sometimes people don't tip well, other times they do. If you're a server, you have to cope with the fact or you'll end up pissing off all of your customers and hurting the restaurant as a whole. \\n\\nAt many restaurants you interact only with your server. As a result, you associate their personality and professionalism with that of the restaurant. In our experience, Polaris Grill is an ungrateful, slightly disgruntled middle-aged guy with run-of-the-mill appetizers--with a few good beers on draft."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Is it wrong that I was more excited about hitting this place during my recent jaunt up the turnpike than going to any theme park? It has certainly been hyped up...and for me that often leads to disappointment, as restaurants tend to have a hard time living up to the mythical status bestowed upon them by fawning food bloggers, Yelpers and the like. Yet, The Ravenous Pig met my lofty expectations. \\n\\nFrom the beginning, service was cordial and efficient; very \\"professional,\\" in fact. This went along with the overall decor, which came off to me as quite a bit more upscale than I was expecting. I was thinking this place would be more \\"pubby,\\" not necessarily brick and white-tablecloth style. You might want to not look like a total slob when dining here - hey, they'll serve you regardless, but you might feel out of place. It's nicer than you probably think it is by way of looking at the pictures. \\n\\nI'd had the impression that the Rav Pig was a big beer-centric restaurant, but the actual beer list, though well-curated for what it is, with very reasonable prices, isn't all that extensive. There's an interesting-looking wine list, but it turned out to be the cocktail menu that really caught my attention. I ordered a Steamroller, an odd Junipero gin-based cocktail with elderflower, sour, and beer. This one is refreshing, I liked the little fizz and subtle grain notes the beer imparted. \\n\\nThe Ravenous Pig Old Fashioned is the one you want for contemplative sipping. It's bacon-infused Buffalo Trace, vanilla maple syrup, bitters, and comes with an awesome little slab of candied bacon. Resist the urge to eat the bacon right away, let it marinate in the drink for a while. Again, go slow here - when they first bring it out, I found this drink a bit harsh, but as the ice starts to melt a little, it opens up and mellows out nicely, releasing more of the coconut and vanilla flavors you want, with that hint of smoky bacon along for the ride. The Gin & Jam, based on Rogue's Pink Spruce gin, featured rhubarb jam, honey syrup and house sour. After the Old Fashioned, it tasted very sweet to me, but I did enjoy the tart rhubarb.\\n\\nI felt like I had to try a pretzel for starters - pub fare at its most elemental. The pretzel looked highly appealing, and I was a huge fan of the spicy, cinnamon-y mustard (yes, cinnamon) provided for dipping. There was also a Taleggio cheese sauce; a cool contrast, but I was back to the mustard for most bites. Next up, charred octopus. Wow. This was probably my favorite food or drink item I had all night. Served with a smoked potato salad, on a plate painted with a thick swath of squid ink, the octopus had just a perfect char to it, and a melt-in-mouth consistency. \\n\\nApparently I've been on a huge duck kick of late, as I seem to be ordering Hudson Valley Duck Breast at every restaurant that offers it. This is one of the beefier duck plates I've had, coming with not only sliced duck breast, but with smoked duck sausage, braised red cabbage, mustard-glazed fennel and rhubarb relish (more rhubarb!). Tough to even describe all those flavors, it's a beautiful cacophony. Just eat.\\n\\nYes, believe it or not, there was dessert. Bow down to The Crisp, an inventive dessert of stewed strawberries and rhubarb (MORE RHUBARB!), some nutty crunchiness, topped with a toffee ice cream. It wasn't absurdly sweet, it had the whole sweet/tart thing going on, with a good crunch - usually the way I prefer my desserts.\\n\\nI look forward to my next Rav Pig adventure. I hope they continue to find excuses to inject rhubarb into future menu offerings!"},{"name":"Conin Mexican Cuisine","address":"9111 S Barbur Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cannot say enough good things about Conin.

The orange chicken was WHITE MEAT, kids.  I understand in Chinese cuisine white meat is eschewed as pretty much flavorless, but I do not dig on dark meat and the white meat orange chicken was a little miracle.  It had a decent amount of heat without being hot-hot-hot, and chunks of real, identifiable orange peel.  \\n\\nThe boyfriend got beef fried rice, which came in only a single size: monstrous.  The beef was crisp and tender with a little hint of soy sauce and the rice was good, better than my side.  The only complaint I have is the veggie situation.  I like my protein-to-veggie ratio to be pretty even, and my orange chicken only came with two small pieces of broccoli on the side (they were blanched and crisp and I wanted MORE).

Abroad, domestically and even home cooked but nope. Still not a fan. I dislike XO paste or sauce, lemon/orange anything, chow mein, chow fun, baos, sticky rice, moo shu [whatever]. 99% of stir fry is gross (tastes like the wok), sweet and sour anything makes me ill.

The past few years, I've had xlb in: New York (Manhattan and Queens), SF (SF, Millbrae, Cupertino and San Mateo) and LA with Shanghainese, Taiwanese, HKnese and Japanese friends. As much as I love XLB, I still hadn't found pork xlb with the perfect fat ratio or flavorful crab xlb without it being fishy. Well. This place has the most phenomenal filling, soup and dipping sauces for the pork AND crab xlbs. Thus, five stars for a big hot steaming pile of WIN. I did notice the skin is just a touch thick but the combined deliciousness outweighs any of the nit-picking I'm tempted to do.

But I ordered gyro plate and while it was great, it was not filling. (I eat allot)    I ordered an additional plate of meat and it was minimal in portion.    My suggestion for us big eaters, order extra meat on the initial order.   \\n\\nI will be back!"},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We had the XO pork, regular pork, and shrimp and pork soup dumplings.

This felt like borderline harassment and I will not be coming back."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"As you'll see from my other reviews, I have long enjoyed Ravenous Pig and usually compare other Orlando restaurants to it, usually with the Pig coming out way ahead. However, after our most recent experience there, and the lack of response to my email about it, I wonder if I will ever return and feel I have no choice but to write about it. \\n\\nWe made a reservation for our anniversary on a Thursday night at 7:30. We were dressed up and ready to celebrate. We were seated fairly quickly upon arrival, but that is where the satisfactory service ended. No one came to wait on us. Others were seated after us and people waited on them immediately, but everyone ignored us. \\n\\nHere is where I should mention that we are an interracial couple and while we have sometimes been blatantly discriminated against and profiled at other places, nothing like that has ever happened at the Pig. But this night, something happened. Judge for yourself what it was. \\n\\nEveryone literally ignored us. The woman who turned out to be our server came out of the server station, looked at us, and walked back into the server station. After ten minutes or so I told the hostess that no one had been to the table and she said she would get our server. After a little more time, the woman finally came out. But her interaction with us was nothing like a usual Pig interaction. She didn't ask how we were, whether we had been there before, whether it was a special occasion, or whether we had any questions. We placed a drink order and appetizer order and she disappeared. She did not return for some time. Someone else brought our drinks and yet another person brought our appetizer, which was a delicious but complicated tuna tartar that could have used a little explanation. The food runners said nothing, though, and since the server was absent, we had to fend for ourselves.\\n\\nWhen the server finally returned, she answered direct questions but offered no information or questions of her own. We asked questions which she was clearly capable of answering but seemed uninterested in answering. We asked about some wine pairings for our choices and she made two recommendations which turned out to be exceptionally cheap and terrible. Thankfully, she brought a taste so we could choose something else. But her recommendations were horrendous--what you would recommend to inexperienced wine drinkers looking for something cheap. No part of \\"anniversary, dressed up, and regular\\" suggested that was the wine you might want to recommend to us. \\n\\nWe ordered a salad before our entrees. We waited and waited and waited. The salad never arrived. The server didn't return. Finally another server brought out two entree plates. We informed him that we still hadn't received our salad and he said \\"Oh\\" and walked away with the plates.  He then came back with the plates and set them down saying, \\"I need to go ahead and give these to you.\\" Then he left. Our server was nowhere in sight and we were sitting there with food that we weren't ready for.  My veal brisket was both unappetizing to look at and so salty as to be inedible. I ate one bite and could not eat more. My husband's fried seafood plate was more edible but nowhere close to good and not remotely in the ballpark of \\"Ravenous Pig food.\\"\\n\\nI sat there staring at my inedible food because there was no one to complain to, getting increasingly upset. Finally the missing server came back and asked how the food was. I said, \\"You know we ordered a salad that never came?\\" \\"Yeah,\\" she said. \\"I know. Sorry about that. How's your food?\\" Well, that is a completely unacceptable response, but since she asked, the answer was, \\"The food is terrible.\\" She responded by taking my plate away. She returned with a menu that she put down in front of me and then she walked away, never to return. And I mean that literally. She never returned. After that, all our interactions were with the manager, Scott.\\n\\nScott came over to apologize. He was very nice and clearly knew that things were not going well. He said they must be having an off night. At this point the missing salad reappeared but I obviously did not want it or anything else. This was our anniversary night, but after an hour and a half we had eaten nothing but a tuna tartar and been treated as though we should have known our place and used the back door. Scott apologized profusely, gave us a gift certificate, and was very kind. But there was no fixing that fiasco. We paid for our drinks and tartar and left. \\n\\nI don't know what to say about this, as it is entirely out of character for the Pig. I hope this was not discrimination or racial profiling on the part of our server and that it was just total incompetence instead. But either way, I would like to hear that management has attended to the problem so that this does not happen to anyone else."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I love all of the random things here.

I'm happy with the simple things on the menu. \\n\\nThe only reason for 4 stars is that the servers think they are awesome and got super annoyed that our table of 10 lingered and had a 4 course meal.

I'm still shocked at what happened. \\n\\n1) Cash/check only is bullshit, especially when you have no ATM. We had to go to the Plaid Pantry next door. Consequently everyone had only twenties at the end of the night (we each had $5-6 checks). Our waitress (who had been rude and passive aggressive all night) told us that she didn't think the restaurant could give us change. She argued with us for a bit before giving in, as the only alternative was separate checks and she was unwilling to do that. She huffily went back into the kitchen and came out with a pile of ones, fives and a filthy plate of quarters and said \\"we all had to dig in our pockets to get this for you.\\" Um, you sell coffee and desserts and you only take cash and you don't have ones?? How are we supposed to pay? \\n\\n2) About 20 minutes after we arrived our waitress asked if she could take one of our three small tables because several people had called ahead wanting to come to the restaurant. We were in a group of eight and she took one of our tables. Of course the table sat unused the entire night. \\n\\n3) Waited for goddamn ever to get our check, then it came back with what appeared to be a note written from one waiter to another in the middle. The rest of the check made no sense. \\n\\n4) The place was hot as hell. No air conditioning in the middle of August. And it took forever to get water, which of course had no ice. \\n\\n5) To top it all off, at the end of the night, after dealing with the ones/fives/quarters debacle, we decided to leave about an 8% tip, which we considered generous given the godawful service. After we left our waitress stormed out of the front door and proceeded to yell at us on the front lawn, demanding to know what she had done wrong. She argued with one of the women in our group for several minutes before storming back inside. \\n\\nAfterwards, a member of our group said that the woman seemed to be on drugs.

Still, it has a reputation as \\"Cathay Horrific.\\" I wonder if they're paying off someone in the city to stay in business after half of the complaints I've heard.\\n\\nAgain, the food isn't bad at all, but the service is horrible.\\n\\nIf I could complain about one more thing, it would be that they charge $4.95 for a bottle of bud. Not draft or the like, but a regular old bottle. Usually under $3 in most places in this area. Make of that what you will.\\n\\nIn good judgement I really can't recommend this place. It's a bit pricey for what it is. You're better off at Mandarin King or Sakura in Quincy Point if you want our version of classic Chinese food. Better prices and just as delicious, minus the atmosphere and HORRIBLE service."},{"name":"33 & Melt","address":"13790 Bridgewater Crossings Blvd, Ste 1000","city":"Windermere","stars":"4","text":"Soooooo good!!!

Our kids followed this with the halibut and scallop dishes and my wife and I split the buffalo - all wonderful. We finished with the chevre cheesecake, creme brulee, and ricotta donuts.\\n\\nArtist Point features the wines and beers of the Pacific Northwest and we enjoyed them enormously - my wife had an Oregon Pinot Noir and I had a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. And the service was excellent as well - we had a wonderful time.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the atmosphere just doesn't live up to the rest of the experience.

First off, I really appreciate their breakfast cocktails. Quite honestly, drinking alcohol at breakfast is fantastic, and their large selection of morning cocktails erases all guilt from partaking. If it was wrong, why would there be so many choices? Irrefutable logic. Moving on...\\nTheir menu is definitely veghead friendly. Lots of vegetarian/vegan options, and our waiter did not bat an eyelash when the vegan of the group built her meal from scratch (an option not on the menu). Our server was wonderfully attentive and friendly. I'm also fairly certain he was in a band. Most likely drums. \\nThe food was really great too. I never had grits before, so I was skeptical about the cheesy grits. I fell in love. Grits, grits, grits. So good. The buttermilk biscuit was truly out of this world. I mean, from Mars or something. It was so delicious. Really soft, flaky, and this intense velvety love flavor (quite possibly the strangest descriptive words for a biscuit). I ordered the broccoli cheese scramble, which was a fairly simple menu option. There was nothing wrong with it, and I gladly finished my plate. \\nI guess why I didn't go totally cuckoo for this place was because I felt like their breakfast menu could have been a bit more inventive. It seemed like a lot of their options were using the same main ingredients as their foundation. Which is fine, probably a lot more waste-friendly too. But the menu, at times, felt a bit repetitive. That being said, what my friends ordered looked nothing like my own. There was also some really wacky choices, like the Tim Curry. So maybe I'm just being a bit too menu-picky.  \\nOther than that, I did feel like the prices were just a dollar and a half too steep. I did shy away from ordering one of the more creative breakfast items because of the price tag. But I think this is my poor student sensibilities kicking in. \\nOverall, I'm very happy with Tin Shed and am excited to return for an alcohol fueled brunch delight."},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Delicious pies!

He was very friendly, but didn't stop by very often (we waited longer than normal for the check and then to pay for the check after it was dropped off).  \\n\\nThe menu was basically bar food, but it was pretty good.  I ordered the bleu cheese burger and my partner ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, and we split the two.  Both tasted delicious.  The burger was still juicy, as they were able to accommodate a \\"medium\\" cook request (yea!) and the buffalo chicken wrap was dripping with just the right amount of spicy hot sauce on it.  The fries were average.  They had potential, but I think they had been sitting out awhile and the fryer oil needed changing.  \\n\\nWe were impressed by the drink menu Joe's offered on each table.  They had specialty drinks, including drink shots, listed with their ingredients.  That's something a lot of bars should offer more of.  I'd be more likely to buy shots to try something new if I knew the names (and ingredients) of some outside of my typical 3 or 4.  \\n\\nThe crowd was definitely gay, but we could see where the restaurant/bar would be fun for college-aged people, gay or straight.

A dish that started with a masa base with spaghetti squash, seasonings, dabs of cheese and chili sauces to dip your bites into and the piece de resistance...crispy quinoa on top. So many textures, flavors, and all anchored by the best masa we have ever tasted. We split this and resisted licking the plate with great effort.\\nWe finished up our tasty meal with an order of Suadero Tacos.

Confit Brisket, Black Magic Oil, Avocado Salsa Cruda in four servings that featured a crispy crust on the brisket, amazingly savory taste, cool and fresh avocado to cut the heat that built gradually as we ate them, and delectably fresh tortillas that held everything together with that clean corn taste you always want and only sometimes get in a corn tortilla.\\nWe were full and when we got the bill, were surprised to see we had just swooned over a $42 dinner for two with a beer. \\nNice. \\nComplimentary valet makes the tight parking workable and with food like this, I can't help but think that Suerte will be exceeding expectations for years to come.\\nWe will be back!"},{"name":"Cafe Canela","address":"9070 Research Blvd, Ste 303","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Cafe Canela a.k.a.

We are trying to organize the Board Game Olympics at someone's house, but until then, this place will do. We arrive at 6pm. On their website, they said they only take reservations for the big table in the back. Since we called and it was already taken, we thought we should make sure we get a big table for ten by coming early. No such luck... and there were other tables with reserved signs on them by the way. \\n\\nWe start out sitting at the bar because we were told that if we came back in half an hour, our wait time would be about an hour. Hmm, so should I go up the street for a poutine? So seven of us sat at the bar waiting for them to patiently call our name. If you call asking them every time a table looks empty if we can have it waiting patiently.  We started out with a couple of poutines and chickpea fries. There was minimal sharing because we were sitting all in a row and around a big pillar. My hubby got a gigantic beer and I got a coke. The poutine was good. I had the Werechicken one... it had blue cheese. I am a sucker for blue cheese. The chickpea fries were really interesting. They aren't hard and crispy like a fry, but rather crispy and soft. I know, it doesn't make sense. The outside it crisp and inside is soft and hot. Dipping sauce is also good. I wanna make these at home. I ate these while looking for all the words on their crossword coasters. I did not get very far. \\n\\nAfter an hour or so at the bar, we were given a table by the door. There were still seven of us, so it was a table for seven. Since our other friends were coming later, they said they would give us chairs when they showed up... more on that later.\\n\\nThe funnest thing on their menu is the shooting dice for shots. So you get a pair of dice and whatever number you throw is the type of shot you drink. Our friends played a lot because if you get 20 (the number on the dice, not the number of shots), you get to keep the glass. \\n\\nNow I got a burger. It was okay. I picked at the fries for a long time while playing Cards Against Humanity. One friend shows up to join us. The server tells us there are no extra chairs as promised. Her suggestion is we push all the chairs on one side of the table together and that we squish. Alright. We played another game a friend showed us: telephone pictionary. You draw, you pass, you guess, you pass, you draw... until whatever you wrote in the first place is no longer present in the pictures your friends draw. Another two friends show up, still no chairs. More squishing.\\n\\nNow I am eating their bread pudding. I always want to order it. It seems like something I would like. It was okay... I ate this while we stuck post-its to our foreheads trying to guess the name on the post-it. The girls who spilled beer on me at the table next to us leave. Yeah! Chairs. \\n\\nStorm Crow was fun, but I would only go if we have enough chairs. It's no fun when your bum is hanging off the seat for six hours... Yes, six hours."},{"name":"Nook","address":"781 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Awesome place. Great food. The wait can be long sometimes but the service is good.

They were cooked perfectly--crunchy outside and still tender inside.  My BF ordered hot boneless wings and homemade potato chips. He liked both.

Let me start off with the good: The food was DELICIOUS. I went with a group of 6 people, we all had different dishes, and we all loved them. Definitely the best brunch meal I have had in Atlanta. \\n\\nThat being said, service was excruciatingly disappointing, and our server didn't seem to care at all that she was super slow and made mistakes in our order. She ended up being very rude about it actually-- I get being new at a job, but at least be apologetic when it's clear you're providing poor service. \\n\\nFirst, we arrived and our server didn't know the specifics of the bottomless brunch (whether you can interchange between the 3 options-- you can by the way). She let us know she had just started a couple days prior so didn't see it as a big deal that she didn't know. Going forward knowing that we tried to cut her as much slack as possible. \\n\\nShe got our initial drink order wrong 3 times. Had to come back to the table 3 times to confirm she got it right. Drink service was SO slow, though unsure if that was the kitchen or the server. Those with other servers seemed to be getting their drinks in a timely manner. Next, my side item for my entree never came out. Neither did my boyfriends. By the time we finished eating I had only been brought ONE drink... when I'm paying for a bottomless brunch. So basically I would have paid 12$ for a mimosa (we ate for about an hour). Second round of drinks came out-- one person ordered a bellini... instead she brought 6 bellinis... at that point we just wanted a drink so we sucked it up and drank it. Then she abruptly brought our checks without us even asking for them, or indicating we were done with our meals.\\n\\nSeemed like we were being rushed out. at that point I told her we never received our side items... she asked if I wanted mine to go, and I awkwardly said \\"...we're not ready to leave yet. I came for bottomless drinks and have only received one\\". Then she told us that my boyfriends entree didn't come with a side because it was eggs Benedict served on an English muffin... so that counted as the side. 1. Why didn't she tell us that when he ordered his side? 2. That's just weird since it was listed with all the other entrees that got sides. But I digress. \\n\\nFelt like us staying past the time we finished our meal was an issue for her. It got to a point where I decided to politely mention our slow service to another employee, not to be \\"that person\\" or be not understanding toward a server... but because it's just ridiculous to pay $12 for ONE mimosa during a bottomless special, I just wanted someone to help her out! \\n\\nThe manager was GREAT, and all of a sudden our drinks were flowing appropriately for bottomless. She was awesome. Props to management! \\n\\nAnyway, as we were leaving our server gave me a super rude side eye.... and then rolled her eyes as I walked past. Luckily I didn't care because at that point I finally had the appropriate amount of mimosas and I could be the bigger person and blow it off. \\n\\nSuper long review... but in conclusion= AMAZING FOOD, AWFUL SERVER, GREAT MANAGER WHO HELPED US OUT ONCE OUR CONCERNS WERE VOICED.\\n\\nPS: The bathroom was disgusting with pee all over the seat of one stall, the floor of another, and wet TP on the 3rd stall.

She wanted to give it a shot, so we went on a Wednesday night.  \\n\\nWe weren't greeted at the door so we grabbed a few menus and pulled a few table together for our friends (there were 8 or us). We have all worked in the service industry, so we made sure to pick a few tables that were out of the way.  After about 5 minutes the waitress came around and told us we needed to move. She straight up asked a couple a few tables away (in the middle of eating) if they could move to a table across the room! They did and then she pulled table together for us.\\n\\nWe all sat down, and despite thinking it was all strange, stayed. About 5 minutes later (when we were ready to order), she came and said 'this just isn't going to work' and without asking, began to re-arrange our tables AGAIN! It was so awkward! Then we asked if we were ready to order. Before we could even respond, she said she would be back when we were ready. We asked her to stay and take our order because she was obviously busy and we would love to get our order in. \\n\\nAs she started taking orders she didn't even fight back making rude faces if someone took more than 1 breath to order their beverage or dessert. After a very obvious eye-roll a friend of mine asked her what the face was for. She said ' you all are making it very hard for me to do my job' (we had told her that we were missing 2 people from our party and that they could just order when they arrived)....now I know this isn't ideal for a server, but give me a break!! You get paid to do this! it's not like I put my feet on the table and asked that she start rubbing them!

Completely real in that sense. \\n \\nI have always believed that all this is accompanied by the attention of the staff.  It's great when you visit a place for the first time and see that perfect conjunction.  That didn't happen here. \\n \\nAs for the taste, it's completely true. They're authentic and special flavors.  The presentation of the dishes is spectacular.  We tried the Mexican fajitas, sensational; the seasoning is exquisite. My wife's daisies and Long Island are very delicious.  I tried some shrimp tacos (big mistake), I'm not a fan of seafood and with this experience I think I'll try it again in my life at least one restaurant of this category.   The shrimp smelled rotten, as if it were frozen and after a while it was just reheated and mixed with the vegetables in the taco. \\n \\nWhen I realized that I asked my waiter to replace them, there was no denying it... I decided to change them for something else. \\n \\nAs I was about to receive my plate I saw the character who said he was \\"the manager of the place, Raul\\" approaching. His stubborn and ridiculous attitude leaves a lot to be said.  Apparently he thought it was \\"stupid\\" of me to say that the shrimp was not fresh.  I gently responded by telling him that seafood was dangerous in its decayed state, but that I was feeling good about the plate replacement and that I was enjoying it... but to my surprise instead of responding in a friendly way (he seems to dislike my response, plus the stress on his face and a rather offensive smile) he says to me that \\"I was happy to leave the restaurant\\" if he didn't like any of the dishes. \\n\\nMy wife and I were completely silent.

We tried four different appetizers and were very impressed with them all (pimento cheese with fresh bread, steelhead salmon ceviche with house-made rye, mixed vegetable curry dish, (it was especially good and tasted like I was back in southern Thailand), and their famous biscuits with agave butter) . The dishes were very diverse in style and all notably delicious. Their appetizers are actually an excellent value for a restaurant as nice as this one and with a \\"$$$\\" dollar rating. The entr√©es (steak and fried chicken) were also really excellent, even though we were hardly hungry after the appetizers. My fried chicken was a good size and came with a potato side dish and a spinach salad, both were very good and had flavors that I wouldn't be able to duplicate easily at home. My wife is particular about her steak. When it came out I was concerned that it was not cooked correctly, but it was perfectly rare on the inside with a great crust on the outside. Most restaurants don't do this well on the first try without instruction. The honey, apricot, cream-cheese tart was a perfect example of this restaurant. It had a class 50s-60s flare, but included some cooking techniques were far more modern and really cool to try. The wait staff were attentive, but didn't hover.

Not being in a rush, we tried to remain positive and order dessert. After 15 more minutes she returned, sans bill, and we had enough. \\n\\nOnce we received the bill, we payed and couldn't get out of there fast enough.

We shared everything but be aware that portions are small. This is a restaurant about blending flavors, combining unique ingredients together. It is not about mass quantities of food. Each bite should be enjoyed and appreciated for well thought out recipes. \\n\\nThere were many highlights. I began with a Don Dario cocktail. It was described as a margarita, but it was far more than that, as it contained sarsaparilla and tamarindo. The flavors blended well together. The chips con salsa were unique with a delicate red salsa on a very well executed chip, light shredded cheese that was not melted, and various vegetables. The Chicken Tamal was well seasoned and cooked in a red sauce with a touch of chicken skin. The Beet Tostada included golden beets bursting with flavor. Other standouts were the Broccoli with unique gouda queso which looked like whipped cream and the Mushroom Frito. \\n\\nWe also sampled the Duck Custard Flan with crumbles, the Tapioca Con Leche, and the Churros.

I called back and the girl said she didn't think it came with any but she'd have them deliver some. 10 mins later I here the doorbell and open it to an older man going back to his car yelling \\"next time you pay!

They don't have much taste and the spicy broth is very un-spicy. You can barely make out the difference. And their sauces are even worse. They don't let you mix up your own sauce, and their given sauces taste very weird. Majiang tasted sour. I don't know where they bought them.\\n\\nThey serve in very small portions so make sure you circle everything you want to try. Don't doubt that you won't be able to finish it. They give you 4 pieces of cabbage per serving. This is not a complaint, but just be sure you check enough stuff on the menu to not get bored.\\n\\nThe quality of the food isn't that great either. It's not like the meat and veggies are near expired or anything, but they really don't look that fresh, which is kind of surprising, since there seems to be a super high volume of customers, you'd think that the supplies would have to renew on a daily basis.\\n\\nAlso they sometimes get your orders wrong. I think they got 1 wrong and forgot about 2 dishes for us. I understand that there's a hundred ppl in the house, but this is still kinda above my threshold. The only reason I didn't get mad at them is that it's a buffet and I could just order again. And even if they served the wrong dish, it's only 4 pieces of cabbage anyway, who cares...\\n\\nSo there you go.

Newly opened, I gave it a little bit of time to work out kinks but I was soooo curious about the homemade pasta (tagliatelle with truffle) and that it was tableside... well the truffle part is table side as in a chef comes out and grates truffle over your dish. You don't actually get to to see your pasta in the big cheese wheel like I anticipated but that's okay, I'll go back to a different restaurant in Connecticut for that. I will try hard not to tear this place apart cause I thought it was a cool restaurant but just not worthy of the price paid. You know it's going to be pricey if you don't see the menu posted with price. I've also been waiting for someone to post the menu but whatever, I've done it so you are very welcome!\\n\\nSo let's start off by saying this was an impromptu date night to celebrate our anniversary after the auto show at the BCEC. I've noted it in the Opentable reservation and no one, not even the host acknowledged that. I actually had to wait for her to finish her convo about football with another guest...So we sat down and our server came after maybe 10 minutes. Normally I'm a cocktail kinda girl, but I was like maybe we can try a wine since it's a date night. The wine list is HUGE!!!! But don't bother asking your server for recommendation unless you want to spend at least a $100. I ask him was there any type of full bodied/lots of tannins wine around the $50 or so range and in a big circle, he basically said no I can't recommend anything (aka I'd have to double it or triple it I guess). I looked at him and said okay........ Then he's like we do have the house wine it's just sold here, it's $64 so you can taste that one if you like. Very uncomfortable and way to not find a way. Every server has found a way to accommodate me with a suggestion so I was flabbergasted this one couldn't. So we tried that wine and whatever...I'll just order a bottle because he made me feel so bad already. I know, I know, I shouldn't even care what he thought but I felt like I had to as there were no other choices as he's not giving any. \\n\\nI've been to countless restaurants and if you want to be pretentious then you won't have repeat customers. Every other restaurant I've been treated soooo well so maybe they judge you if you aren't full-blown dressed up but not like anyone was.\\n\\nAnyways, we started off with bread and that bread with the oil/vinaigrette was delicious! He recommended the BURRATA DELLA CASA to start off which had cheese and prosciutto and that was pretty good. I asked what was in the scampi and he said it's just 2 pieces of shrimp... I was waiting for him to say it also came with a little pasta...but nope. I ordered the housemade tagliatelle $45 MP which legit was pasta, cheese, truffles. It was very well cooked but I'm not really dreaming about it so it's good to try once. The bf got the 28oz \\"LONG BONE\\" DRY AGED TOMAHAWK RIB EYE $58 which tasted fine, good for a ribeye.  I loved how the bone is so big! What a great presentation! The side of sweet potato we ordered was to die for! I hate sweet potato so that's saying something!!!!! We did not opt for dessert or coffee as we were full. The atmosphere felt like a Italian version of cheesecake factory with parties everywhere with a bit of olive garden. \\n\\nWould I come back? It really depends... I am interested in trying the duck dish and it is by work.... decisions decisions....but for two people who was not splurging, our bill was still over $200 before tip... The prices are definitely marked up because of it's location in the seaport, if you went to the Burlington one, it'd be much cheaper as it's further away and there would be parking ;)"},{"name":"Bull McCabe's Pub","address":"366A Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Yes!

Even though there is a system for getting pool tables and bowling, there is so much going on that people can just come in and take a table without paying.

There was a special going on for lobster or, perhaps it was just a busy week. With lots of tourists in town.  We decided to dine elsewhere.  This is our second visit to this particular restaurant and we had a good experience.\\n\\nThe restaurant is near the Orange County Convention Center.  There is a complimentary parking lot just behind the restaurant so we parked there.  We arrived at 5:30 and noticed that there were plenty of empty seats in the large outside patio.  We, however, decided to dine inside since it was very warm that evening.  There was a great daily special for Monday - 1 1/4 lbs.  Full Rack of Baby Back Ribs, $10.99.  Each day has a different deal.  Tuesday is Kids Eat Free and there are specials on a Prime Rib Dinner or 12 oz. Choice Rib eye, $12.95. Wednesday has a 1 14 Lb. Live Maine Lobster on special. Thursday the special is a Choice 12 oz. Prime Rib for $12.95.  Friday is Cajun Seared Sashimi Tuna Pasta, $14.95. Saturday is Baked Seafood Sampler, $14.95. Sunday is Shanghai Tacos, $10.95. Be aware that menu prices may vary by location. \\n\\nInstead of the Monday Special, we each decided on the Steak Fajita, $11.95.  The dinner came with a generous amount of thickly sliced Choice Flat Iron Steak cooked exactly as ordered, smothered in Onions & Peppers.  On a separate plate, were Shredded Lettuce, Pico de Gallo, Cheddar Cheese and a generous dollop of Sour Cream.   A covered container held three large warm tortillas.  Although we really enjoyed the sizzling hot meal, we both wished there were more peppers in it as the picture on the menu showed.  Instead, the few peppers on the dish were pretty skimpy and limp.  Nonetheless, we were happy with our choice.  The steak was very tender and moist.  I was sorry that I was too full to order the Capt'n Jack's Buried Treasure Dessert, which is an ice cream cake with Oreo Cookie Crust, Caramel, Chocolate Fudge & Heath Bar Crunch for $5.95.  It comes with a dollop of whipped cream topped with a cherry.  Doesn't that sound decadent?  Oh my! I have to try this sometime!\\n\\nThere are plenty of appetizers on the menu if you are just looking for a light meal.  Zingers are boneless chicken wings and you can get them several ways:  plain, over melted cheese or piled over fries with melted cheeses, bacon bits & Scallions.  Alternatively, have them in a Quesadilla or Tacos, $8.99-$10.99.  Regular wings are on the menu too along with other favorites like Buffalo Shrimp, Fried Mozzarella, Onion Rings, Loaded Fries, Nachos and Fried Calamari.  What I appreciate is that the Special Sauces come Mild, Medium, and Hot along with nine other choices - something for every taste palate.   Appetizers are priced from $6.95 for Chips and Dip to $10.99 for the Ale House Combo: nine Potato Skins, Fried Mushrooms, Fried Mozzarella and Spinach Dip served with tri-Colored Tortilla Chips & Salsa.  Looking for even lighter fare, there are 5 soups and 10 salads on the menu.   I liked the Apple Walnut that you ca n add chicken or steak to for $3 more. \\n\\n Naturally, there are Burgers (you can even build your own) and 10 Sandwiches, too.  There are four kinds of Steaks or have the Flat Iron Steak with Boom Boom Shrimp for $14.95 or add Surf & Turf to any steak for $8.95.  Seafood Choices, Pastas and House Specialties, round out the menu. If you wish Gluten Free or Vegetarian dishes, menus are available upon request. I am sure that almost everyone can find something here to eat. \\n\\nWhile we waited for our foods, I checked out the d√©cor.  There is lots of wood on the high ceilings, the walls, the booths and tables.  Multiple flat TV screens all around the restaurant tune in to different sporting events.  Lots of sports photos and memorabilia complete the d√©cor along with some fish wall hangings.  As a Yankee fan, I took a closer look seeing Derek Jeter's jersey encased on one wall.  Brass railings and a large bar add to the tavern ambiance.  \\n\\nHector, our waiter, was attentive throughout the meal and filled all our requests in a timely manner.  At the end of the meal, he confided that he was a new staff member.  I would not have guessed since he did such a terrific job.   He asked us to fill out an online survey that would help him with his employment.  Of course, I agreed since he tried so hard to please us.  I did complete the survey the next day and mentioned how pleased I was with his service.

I have found often when you get the lunch special many places will give you either lesser quality or slightly less fresh sashimi.  I received salmon, tuna, escolar and yellow tail and the pieces were large and very fresh.  My wife is a vegetarian and she was very happy with the vegetarian sushi selection.  She ordered the San Diego, a roll with asparagus, avocado and cream cheese, and said that it may be the best sushi roll she has ever had.  One of my daughter's is allergic to gluten and we were also pleasantly surprised to find that they had separate gluten free soy sauce.  Our server, Natalia, was super friendly, very attentive and was always smiling.  If there is any downside, the restaurant is in the parking lot of the Mall at Millenia and is right after a very high traffic intersection and getting through the red light with all of the mergers for the mall entrances was challenging but definitely not enough to take away a star.

And then, I found myself there twice in two weeks.  Both times I went for breakfast, and both times were great.  The inside is cozy, and even packed full of people it isnt too loud to chat normally with the others at your table.  The outside patio is lovely, and even on a chilly Portland (summer?) day is nice as they will switch the heaters on.  There is usually a wait, even on the weekdays, but as you watch others eat their delicious looking food, you can help yourself to coffee, water and a selection of teas.  If you go here, make sure your meal either comes with  a biscuit, or get one in addition to your meal.  I have been to countless breakfast places in Portland, and too many bakeries to count, and the biscuits at Tin Shed are very high up on the \\"amazing biscuit\\" list.  Eat it with the home made jam and you wont be wanting.  The service is friendly and prompt and knowledgeable about the menu and what ingredients are in each item, for those of you who have dietary restrictions or allergies.  Both times I was there I thought about getting any of the entrees with their home made rosemary mushroom gravy, but failed to venture there.  Next time.  I would highly recommend the Tin Shed.  If anything, just go in and buy a dozen biscuits and jam and find yourself in baked goods bliss."},{"name":"Ranch 616","address":"616 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Went with a group of eight on a Wednesday night to Ranch 616. It was about half full on the inside and there was a political party on the porch. I like this place for out of towners or larger parties because the have a bit of SW flair, a solid menu and offer reservations. \\n\\nOur food came out very fast -- almost too fast, it would have been nice to slow down the cadence a bit. But few complaints on the food. Started out with the truffle and parm fries, fried oysters and calamari. The oysters were very good, as usual. Crispy and soft, sweet and salty. The truffle fries were fine but I guess I didn't really get the point. The calamari was tough but the dipping sauce was very yummy. \\n\\nThree of us got the tilapia and shrimp for our entree. The shrimp were perfectly fried and crispy, they were not tough at all. They rested on a perfect pile of poblano mashers. The tilapia was coated in a very flavorful pesto that paired nicely with the fish. Unfortunately, the fish appeared to be boiled or something. It was not overcooked but just seemed strange, like they should have sauteed or even pan fried it. Two people got the pork loin and commented it was the most tender pork loin they had ever had. \\n\\nSince it was v close to my birthday, I wanted to try some dessert but nothing on the menu looked good to me. Oh well. One other note: I love the biscuits they bring out before the meal.

Each time hoping that my experience will be better...but it seems that Bunk needs to hire better associates that have customer service skills.. The first time was back in 2009 at the SE location, service was fine, but the food was disgusting. I ordered tomato soup and it came out like pasta sauce. So, I haven't eaten there since. \\n\\nThe other day, a friend randomly invited me to the SW location and I hesitated-remembering the pasta sauce soup. So this time I ordered the Chicken Salad Bacon Dijon Avo Sandwich. I sat outside and waited for my friend (i'm 5 months pregnant) so she went inside and took a cell phone picture of the menu for me to look at (no hand out menus) outside. I told her what I wanted, and she ordered inside. \\nAbout 30-40 minutes later, our sandwiches were ready and mine was missing avocado. I ****very**** politely (I have worked retail for a long time and am very careful with how I talk to people in the service industry) asked a semi-tall blonde worker if I had the correct sandwich. Over her shoulder, she glanced at what I had in my hand and said 'yup.' then turned back. I said,' okay, well..i think I was supposed to get avocado (I'm from California, and avocado on anything gets me excited) on this?' She fully turns around and puts her hand on her hip and points to the wall to the left of her.. \\"We're out of avocado today, it says it on the board, I wrote it right here-see?\\" Bummer attitude. At least offer some sort of substitute? I asked if I could get a different kind of green on my sandwich since it was currently a warm wad of meat and cheese in my hand... \\nShe says, \\"Well, what do you want?\\" Because I can read minds and automatically know what stock of veggies she has...  Quickly I think, 'uh cucumber, spinach, lettuce? I don't know...what do you have?' All they have on hand is spring mix lettuce. Cool, whatever...I was happy. \\nAlthough, I don't think it's too much to ask for considering i'm paying $10.50 for a sandwichhhh...The plus side to this is experience was that it was REALLY really good. \\n\\nSo this balanced out my first experience in an odd turn of events. \\nThird experience was a mix of the first two unfortunately which ultimately solidifies the fact that I wont be going back to try out for a fourth... \\nThis weekend I had an opportunity to visit the SE location yet again on one of the hottest days of the summer. Thankfully they had air conditioning.. This time I took my mother to see what she thought. We walked in and made eye contact and said hi to the *seemingly* only employee working at the bar....? I think he noticed us? After a few seconds of awkwardly looking for a seat-your self sign, we pick a table and sit down.. Realizing (nothing visually instructs you, you have to see what everyone else is doing) that you have to go up to the bar and order, I sat and waited at the table and my mother went and ordered. Is this a sit down or an indoor food truck? I watched two employees look at my mother and walk past her while she waited for the bartender (?) No one said, \\"It will be just a minute, thank you for waiting.\\" \\"Is there anything I can help you with\\" \\"Is there something I can help you with-while you wait for him?\\" Just even smiling and mouthing hi, is a minimal amount of effort for basic service skills. She finally orders and sits down with me. Quicker this time, about 20-25 minutes, our food had everything on it that was supposed to be there, only this time... the portions were a lot smaller. Along with the distant service, and $10 price tag ...it doesn't seem worth it anymore to give this place any more tries with my money.

It's kind of hard to mess that one up, basic commonality to all ceviches that includes red onion, lime and cilantro so when it arrives with none of those ingredients it gives one pause. Also when it has no salt nor flavor it gives one more than just pause. The ribs were dry despite the gooey sauce, the green potatoes arrived undercooked - nothing like a mouthful of starch. Even the guacamole was pur√©ed within an ounce of its life. I enjoy when I can identify that it actually comes from avocado and doesn't look and taste over processed.

My meal was 5.70+tax, and she ended up charging me $10+ for one meal. When I asked her, she refused to answer me and caught an attitude. When she gave me my drink, she said how she \\"should've dropped it instead\\" as she closed the window, as if I couldn't hear her. Please stop hiring people like TENISHA and hire more competent people for a minimum wage job."},{"name":"Ginza Japanese Steak & Sushi Bar","address":"1101 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Just to start - we didn't have the hibachi or the sushi, so can't say anything about those items, but we did try some of the Szechuan food.  It's on a page almost completely in Chinese so we had to ask our very friendly server just what exactly was on that page, and boy are we glad that happened! It turns out that they make various noodles and broths from scratch and serve this very authentic (their words, not mine...so I'm assuming it's authentic) Szechuan food.  The eats were very good (spicy beef noodles and roast duck noodle soup) and you've got to get the wide noodles with your dish...just awesome.  Can't wait to try more from them...just surprising to get good Szechuan food from a place called Ginza, but I'm ok with that."},{"name":"Bloc Somerville","address":"11 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Cafe service at restaurant prices.

Cool interior though and some items on the menu are tasty."},{"name":"Hyatt Regency Orlando","address":"9801 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We had a standard room with 2 queen beds. It was wonderful. The bathroom mirror had a digital tv on it which was so cool. Very clean. Very nice bath products. \\n\\nOur favorite thing was the beeline 24 hour restaurant  and the market place. Kristin M was our waitress each morning as we requested her. The entire property serves Starbucks. The food at the Beeline, Marketplace and Coconuts is moderately priced, not like most hotels that rip the tourists off. Food was delicious for breakfast and lunch. We went off premises for dinners. Pool was heated. You have to be 48 inches tall to go on the Waterslide. We saw children in tears that weren't aware of this rule. Self parking is $27 per night plus taxes which to us was steep and unnecessary. Valet is $40 a night. Resort fee is $25 per night. Highly recommend!"},{"name":"CoM Vietnamese","address":"120-7688 Alderbridge Way","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Pretty good Chicken Vermicelli!

It is definitely a little pricey, but obviously it doesn't deter me from going there. The first few times I tried Panera in general I was unimpressed, but I discovered that it is really just about determining which of their menu options are actually good in my opinion. The people at this location are very friendly, and the service is usually pretty dang fast."},{"name":"Kneaded Pleasures Cafe & Pizza","address":"3573 Far W Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Totally average lunch food.

Convenient location though!"},{"name":"Dunkin'","address":"155 Spring St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"2.5","text":"Awful service.

Upon entering, the new decor was cute, but nothing about it is \\"factory\\".  Then, my party  of 6 was instructed to have a seat anywhere , then were told the open table we chose wasn't avaiable, then we waited 10 minutes and then we able to stay at this table. Our server Oliver can to the table and immediately had the disclaimer ok something like \\"I'm gonna be taking care of you tonight, and I apologize, but I am not at my best\\" which is usually a modest statement, but here, very factual. \\n\\nWe placed our food and drink orders at the same time, thank goodness,  after sorting out the 3 menus. Oliver said he'd grab waters for the table and failed to do so for the entire 2 hours we were there. Our drinks came out at random time and not together, then barely refilled. And we were ready to drink! Their loss. \\n\\nWhen the food finally arrived, it was okay. I know my friends said the Mahi fish sliders  were awesome. My $10 small plate of fried risotto was bland and a pitifully small portion for the price. Some food came out on plates, some in paper food boats like at the fair. Cray had way more slider options! \\n\\nGetting our checks  and paying took 15 minutes and then some as our waiter also screwed up my check. \\n\\nOther complaints: there is only 1 bathroom for one person at a time, no hostess, uncomfortable  seats , slow service. \\n\\nEven though this restaurant was redone my Restaurant:Impossible recently, still not worth it."},{"name":"Ranch 616","address":"616 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Very cool atmosphere with great food and drinks.

This restaurant is in a house, and it is adorned with bomb-a** Rainbow Brite wallpaper, and dope art (think bueyes and Selena, queen of Tejas). It is decked out with a patio, full bar, and two separate rooms for dining. Listen to me, it's so cute and worth your time. I ordered the chicken sopecitos, doused them in Valentina, and had a bite of the street-style Mexican corn my husband ordered, a buttery take on the classic. The chicken sopecitos were just right, crispy on the outside, buttah on the inside."},{"name":"Rebecca's Cafe","address":"One Financial Ctr","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is making improvements and really has a lot of options.\\n\\nTheir menu is confusing; there is a difference between the catering menu and the menu here... and there is no menu for here so if you order from the catering menu, you'll be in for a surprise they can't make it.\\n\\nPeople who work there are nice.\\n\\nRebecca's needs to wander over to UDG and take a gander at their salad offerings.  UDG Salad is my dream Saladified.\\n\\nAnother reviewer said it best: this place lacks personality.  All the locations have that \\"cold\\" feeling.  I feel Rebecca's could use a great kick in the pants by a restaurant consultant.  Warm up the feeling there, make it less prison cafeteria and more warm and inviting.\\n\\nI think the staff here makes all the difference.
