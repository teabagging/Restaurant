Probably known more for his blue hair and appearance on Hell's Kitchen a few seasons ago than his food, Santos used to run the popular and unique Gargoyle's on the Square before it shuttered not long ago. The room at Abby Lane is bright and clean, and about two-thirds empty on a recent lunch visit, although things seemed to have picked up after walking past the restaurant closer to dinner time in subsequent walk-by's. The menu is pretty traditional, appealing to the masses with minor twists and turns. Three burgers are on the menu, nothing too extravagant but appealing nonetheless. I opted for the namesake, The Abby Burger, with the promise of a burger topped with smoked gouda, horseradish mayo, fried red onions, crispy fries and dill pickles.\\n\\nThe $14 burger is pretty substantial looking. The first noticeable trait is the pillowy and fluffy looking bun, which ultimately tastes somewhere between Challah and  a Bulkie roll. It's lighter than I expected but still too much bread, even though it is something different. The beef is cooked to a medium, is pretty dense but has relatively good seasoning and an average amount of juiciness. Overall it's just ordinary: solid beef no doubt, but nothing special, which is disappointing due to the chef's pedigree. Toppings are mediocre and mostly absent. The cheese, while melted, is anything but smokey, and the horseradish mayo is nowhere to be found on my taste buds, although I can sort of see it spread onto the bun. Fried red onions are very greasy and feel disjointed; they are pale and are poorly battered and it shows. Fries are as crispy as advertised, tasting as if they may have been battered themselves (but much more successfully), they have a crunch and a salt level that is very desirable. A side of dill pickles are classic and crunchy, and this burger eater appreciates someone finally making a solid pickle and not using the easy route with a certain local pickle company.\\n\\nThe burger at Abby Lane is not great but it's not a bad one either. While I the beef wasn't so interesting and the fried onions were a miss, the unique bun and quality fries were two pluses. Overall it's just not a burger to get excited about and not one I would go out of my way to return to, much like many of the other burgers out there I suppose."},{"name":"Breakfastville","address":"339 University Ave SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great service cheap breakfast Easy to pass it by a must stop at Easy to drive pastOn University Ave between Pryor Street and Metropolitan"},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"YUMMMM TILT IS YUMMMM. \\n\\nI've had tilt on two occasions - for breakfast and for dinner.

(Yes, I even passed the Spaghetti Factory... I love that place!)  I almost gave up and was going to wander the streets until the doors opened for the play I was going to see. When across the street from the theatre, I saw this. I entered, and really liked the openness and decor of this small restaraunt. I asked to see a menu, liked what I saw, and sat down. Even though I just wanted an appetizer, they were quite accomadating in that. I sat at the \\"bar\\" (which is actually the kitchen) and watched them go to work. I saw this guy intricately put a piece of salmon with a tiny bit of cream cheese on a small sliver piece of salmon and put that on a cucumber slice which looked like a work of art how they did it. Surprisingly, they served that to me, which they said was a little bonus. WELL THEN! Even though I am not a cucumber or a salmon guy, i couldnt pass it up now, could I? It was yummy!

Wanna know why? Busters and the nasty piece of work dispatcher I dealt with today tells you all you need to know. My Vespa scooter was stolen and a few days later I got a call from the police that it had been found a block from my home. I called Busters immediately to tell them I didn't want it towed as I would drive it home because I lived so close. And besides who wants to pay some tow truck a-holes $100 for the pleasure of taking you recovered property even further away from where it belongs. The dispatcher I spoke with told me they hadn't picked it up yet and that only the police could cancel the tow. Meanwhile i was on the block where it had been found and couldn't find it. I called the police and they said only I could cancel the tow. So I called Busters again. This time they tell me it's been picked up and is en route to their yard. So I ask them to have the driver turn around and bring it back. I'm put on hold for 10 minutes and then put through to the original dispatcher. Now she's telling me it's already arrived at their yard. I ask her why they towed it when I had asked them not to, especially considering it was a recovered stolen vehicle. She repeated that only the police could cancel the order. I told her that wasn't true and that the police had told me the opposite. I also pointed out to her that all she had to do was ask the driver to wait so I could provide ID and then take it home. The police had confirmed it was my right to do this with my property. She told me that according to their contract blah blah blah they couldn't do that which is a lie.

Not a big deal, going on a weekend I expected it. However, I didn't expect to be told that there is no bar and the standing room in the hall was full so we should leave and go to a bar down the street while waiting. That's so strange.

He was very nice and rushed them and less than 5 minutes it was on the table. The eggs were ok - the texture of them was amazing. I don't think that they were anything special though. They tasted good but not great. The fries were good too, the egg was a little undercooked - the white was raw but the yolk was perfect. I enjoyed the fries and ate almost all of them. \\n\\nFor the main course I had the beef and my husband had the fish.

I have spent countless lunches/in-between-snacks/dinners at Tacos La Villa. \\n\\nInitial lure: the prices. These guys sure don't skimp on the $1 tacos, and for $3-$5 I can have a fully satisfying meal of 3-5 tacos. I'll usually get a variety, but always, always, always 2 lengua tacos, because they are that good.\\n\\nOnto the food (the BEST PART!). I've been here so many times, I've had an opportunity to try a couple different things on their menu. In their tacos, burritos, and tortas they offer the following meat options: Lengua (beef tongue--seriously, soo good), Al Pastor (marinated pork), Barbacoa (shredded beef), Carne Asada (steak), Cabeza (beef head), and Tripa (tripe). Though I've tried all these options (c'mon, it's just a buck to try one), the lengua and al pastor are my favorites. I find the lengua to be the perfect size, as many places cut it too big for me. Also cooked very well, and it goes perfectly in a taco with a little bit of salt, cilantro, onions, some lime juice, and radishes! I still have yet to determine which salsa from their extensive salsa bar is my favorite on the lengua, so I mix it up a bit. Onto the al pastor--crispy, well seasoned, yummy. Goes well in the tacos but also, I love it in the burritos. So now we're talking about burritos, huh? They are HUGE (think, Chipotle-sized). Filled with fresh ingredients and mexican cheese, but also a little bit more pricey ($6? which isn't even that much, but compared to the other prices it seems like a fortune). Anyways, the burritos are delicious with al pastor, barbacoa, or cabeza (beef head). The barbacoa was pretty typical, but very tender. I've never had cabeza until going here, and although it was incredibly tender and flavorful, I never order it because I still don't know what \\"beef head\\" means. I mentioned the salsa bar earlier but I wanted to expand on that quickly, because that is one of my favorite things about Tacos La Villa. Sometimes 3 different types of salsa verde are offered, as well as a smokey red salsa that I love. Also, the tacos, etc. come \\"naked\\" for the most part (unless ordered to go), so you can dress them yourself with onions, cilantro, radishes, cucumbers, pickled peppers/carrots, cabbage, and limes. Sometimes they even have diced raw jalapenos! Salsa bars are awesome, because you have countless flavor possibilities and combinations.\\n\\nService: I wouldn't normally even review on this since it is an \\"order at the counter\\" type place, but I think it's worth noting that of all the times I've come here with my weird orders and completely random #s of tacos mixed w/tamales, they have never gotten anything wrong! While they are not overtly friendly, they aren't rude either. I love it. I don't know why, but I hate the \\"Hello! How Are You?? Oh those are my FAVORITE TACOS! blah blah blah\\" type service. Just shut up, let me eat my food!! So thanks for being cool, dude behind the counter who never cracks a smile.\\n\\nAnd lastly, ambiance. I'll admit, it is lacking a bit, it still has the quiznos decorations up, and sometimes it smells like cigar smoke from the cigar shop next door. But I refuse to dock any points for ambiance. I've had waaayy too many crappy meals in pretty places, and many more delicious meals in crappy looking places. If you're worried about health or sanitation, have no fear. You can see them prepare and cook your food right there. I don't know about you guys, but when I go out to eat, I go out to EAT.

They also now have a savory menu with items like tacos, lasagna, pot pies, mac and cheese, sandwiches and breakfast bowls, biscuits and waffles.  Umm... heaven?  \\n\\nON top of that, they have what gave them their fabulous reputation: baked goods galore.  In looking at the plentiful display cases, most folks, 98% or so, would probably have no idea in looking at them that the items are either gluten free or vegan.  Score.  After trying this and that and this, I am not overly impressed with anything except for the cookies are above average for gluten-free vegan and the donuts are phenomenal.  In all of my eating of vegan and some gluten-free vegan, donuts are generally pathetic save for a few infamous establishments.  This place has the best gluten-free vegan donut I have ever eaten.

My other gripe is when you sign the receipt, they want 15-20% tip, you know, the tip you provide for table service. But there's no table service. If I tipped the 20% suggested on the receipt, my meal with a drink (no pie!) would come to about $20, for doing my own waiting in line, pickup, drink getting, and bussing.

We were walking in Beacon Hill and pretty hungry. Passing the menu, the food sounded amazing. We wanted Italian without having to hike to The North End. A lot of what we saw on the menu sounded authentically Italian. They had bread and tomato soup, arancini, etc. The fact they served hanger steak was what sealed the deal to eat here. Very hard to find cut of meat!\\n\\nThe inside is nice. There's a wine theme. It doesn't at all remind me of Italy, given the menu. It's more of a Napa Valley concept. Tan wood walls, wine label wallpaper. They even have ceilings with tons of hanging wine bottles in the rest room ... Which need a good dusting. They were literally covered in dust.\\n\\nThey have a good selection of wine. The by the glass selection is just okay at best. Your best bet is to come with friends and split a bottle. The wine list is long and they even have some ecclectic high end wines (lots of Italian reds) Was surprised not to see Sassicaia or Tignanello on the menu though. Maybe I missed them. Wish they had a nice super Tuscan on the per glass menu.\\n\\nThe food was mediocre. On a Saturday you'd think you would put your best chef on. I've had better cooked steaks at Outback. No exaggeration. To take a cut like hanger steak and overcook it is a shame. I ordered medium rare. It came sliced and clearly well. (Was grey throughout with a tiny bit of pink towards the center.) The chef sliced and fanned the steak knowing full well it was overdone because they could see it was grey. They served it anyways.\\n\\nBeyond being overcooked, it was dry. My guess it was sliced as soon as it came out of the pan without letting it rest. A rookie mistake but I'm guessing it was done because the kitchen was busy. Also the steak had almost no seasoning. It tasted like it wasn't seasoned with salt and had no crust on the outside from a sear. The gorgonzola cream sauce was oily and runny and looked more like an oil slick than a pan sauce. Bland.\\n\\nThe aranccini were bland, alrgough they were fried well. The fontina cheese in the center was perfectly melted which made us super dissapointed because they looked so good yet they had almost no flavor other than starch from the rice.\\n\\nWe looked around at the other diner's dishes and nothing looked amazing. The portions were small and there was just no 'wow factor'. On the way to the restroom I spotted a prep area with a glass front refrigerator and saw the cold cuts they use for the expensive chartuccerie trays and it's what you'd find at an upscale supermarket like Wholefoods.

That convo was probably karma for what my family & I have often done inadvertently to unsuspecting waiters. Sorry to you ALL.\\n\\nAfter her, I wanted to radically simplify for the window dude's sake, opting for \\"two sliders, one of each please\\" (HOW. EASY.) And they were fan-****ing-tastic. Can't even decide which of those little honeys was better than the other one! But you could probably sandwich a sh*t-covered shingle between Hawaiian rolls & I'd probably eat it, with yummy noises. I'm certain their toppings were not either of those (instead being brisket and pork banh mi), and they were the bomb.

We were seated relatively quickly and given menus right away, but it took a while to get someone to come back and take our orders. Brunch meals come with a mini fruit fondue appetizer, which was lovely, but the fruits are sliced with peels still on (including the bananas), so I had to sit there and cut/peel the kids' fruit before they could dip it. One of my kids ordered a meal that came in a hot cast iron skillet (I was not aware of this when he ordered it), and the server came and plopped a piping hot skillet in front of a five-year-old with no warning of it being hot. I managed to warn him a split second before he reached out to touch it. Worried that he might burn himself, I asked for a plate to put the food on, and was presented with a tiny side plate that didn't even fit the contents of the skillet. The brunch food was okay... nothing spectacular, but quality in line with the price point. The home fries were soggy and unappealing. Nobody came to clear away empty dishes during the meal, and the table was a cluttered mess. Upon finishing, we wanted to ask for the bill, but couldn't catch anyone's eye. We waited. And waited. And waited. And finally after about 20 min, another server came over and apologized -- apparently our server had left and not handed over the table. Twenty minutes is a really long time to wait for the bill, with a three and five year old. \\n\\nSecond visit: one week later, date night with hubby (no kids). Everything started out okay. We were seated quickly, given menus and water, and had our orders taken in a reasonable amount of time. Music was loud to the point of being painful and unpleasant, but I realize some people dig that. When the $24 fondue for two showed up, we were somewhat taken aback at the size of it (small) for the price. It bizarrely included a single, small cup of drinking chocolate for us to share. It seems weird to offer a dish for two, but only include one drink. The food was great quality (especially the chocolate), and nicely presented, but at the $24 price point, we expected more than we got. The chocolate pots are deceiving. They look big, but the part where the chocolate goes is actually quite shallow. Still hungry from our shared fondue, we asked to order more food. Waitress brought us new menus, and then we waited... and waited... and waited... to get our orders taken. Could not for the life of us catch anybody's eye. Finally, we got totally fed up and decided to go somewhere else for the rest of our dessert. Waitress came back, and we asked for the bill.

When she returned, she informed us that they were also out of milk ( which meant our 3 year old now would be fussy).  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but was incredibly disappointing.  The cornbread was cool, the pulled\\nPork was tough, and the ribs were low quality and not cooked well.  Bones were tough to eat around and some of the meat was so tough that I questioned whether some bites were meat or bone. Of the 4 plates of ribs we got, 1 was above 1 star. On a positive note, the cole slaw was pretty good and my 3 year old loved his hot dog. Also concerning was when I dropped My fork and when the waitress came by rather than picking it up, she purposely kicked it under the table across from us.

My boyfriend liked his (vegetarian, real cheese) mac and cheese, but didn't love it, and it seemed small for what we paid, on par with a panera mac and cheese, which costs much less.

The first time I was only able to get appetizers as I had to run before it was time for entree service.  Every time I've had the crispy brussel sprouts and the duck fat fries.  Both of those items are worth coming here alone.  Seriously.  The last time I came was on a Sunday and it was busy but not crazy.  We got seated outside near the fence.  It's kind of weird because I guess to monopolize on all of their seating with what they had, they created privacy 'screens' on the picnic table highboys.  It's really awkward.  That paled in comparison to us being seated and not being greeted by our server for nearly 20 minutes.  My date and I were both hungry and thirsty and every time one of the two servers in our area came by, I made a point to try to make eye contact but neither came by.  FINALLY, one of them came by and by that point I was irritated.  I let it be known that I was annoyed and he apologized and we didn't have any further service issues through the night.  Their cocktails are also quite good.  We ended up with the same aforementioned appetizers and they were both solid.  I ended up getting the pork loin and she got the crispy chicken thighs.  Overall, the entrees left a lot to be desired.  My pork was a bit overcooked and not very flavorful.  The highlight of the whole dish was the vegetables and it was mostly because of their use of pickles in the veg.  The portion was also kind of sparse.  3 slices of pork loin in a HUGE platter.  The highlight of the crispy chicken was the skin.  The sauce/flavor of that dish just seemed watered down or something.  It was just a very faint flavor.  Overall, I was really let down with what I was expecting to be an amazing treat.  If you haven't been here before, come for happy hour and get the apps and cocktails.

During that time we drank free Lone Star, we danced, we sang along to the Big Rock Candy Mountain on acoustic guitar, and we determined that half the line consisted of locals and half the line was guests of locals.  \\n\\nThe brisket is phenomenal.  It's the reason I visited Austin.  (Well, also to see my friend.)  It's smoky, it's got a peppery seasoning, and even the lean brisket is tender.  And it reheats well in the microwave!  I ordered 2 lbs for myself and the group seated next to us was secretly judging me until one guy finally commented on my hefty portion size.  I explained I was bringing the leftovers back to SF.\\n\\nThe pork ribs were just ok - can't compete with my KC ribs and way pricier by the pound instead of by the slab.  The meat fell off the bone but was slightly tough and the seasoning was mediocre.  Good thing I only got one to try.\\n\\nThe 2 sauces were pretty good - moderately tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet.  Not that it matters since the brisket requires no sauce.  You also get complimentary white bread and pickles with your order.  My only disappointment is that the white bread is not the super soft Wonderbread but is slightly firmer.\\n\\nWhen we were ordering at about 1:30pm, the beef ribs had sold out a while back but I didn't care.  My friend who's a regular had been wondering who in their right mind would get the smoked turkey and finally decided he would to be THAT guy for a day and get 1/4 lb to try.  Unfortunately it sold out right before he ordered.\\n\\nIn SF we make fun of ourselves for waiting in lines.  Well Austin's ten times worse.  They clearly don't care to make things more efficient.

On a Thursday night at 8:30, there was a buzzing vibrant crowd with a cheerful front-end staff and a punctual reservation system that I enjoy as much as anyone else. \\n\\nThe Service:\\nAmy was our server, and she was great. She had previously done time at Braise, and I love hearing perspectives from the people who work in the biz. FWIW, when Amy left with our drink order, we were approached and asked by other staff if we had been taken care of, not once, but twice. There's a fine line for me between attentiveness and confusion among service staff, but ultimately no big deal. \\n\\nThe Food:\\nI loved the marinated heirloom tomatoes, and I wanted more of them. I obviously missed the boat on the chili-rubbed tuna, since I could taste neither the chili-rub nor the tuna it was rubbed on. The cardamom was definitely present in the duck breast and turnips, and the duck breast itself was beautifully prepared. The fried Brussels sprouts and duck-fat fries are signature sides here that you should probably order, but if you're sensitive to salt, tread lightly.\\n\\nIf We Must Compare Salty Sow to Barley Swine:\\nI'll approach this by telling you how I felt about Salty's Butterscotch Boudino dessert: It's a great pudding, I loved the salted caramel, and the hint of sassy in a sweetened cr√®me fra√Æche. But after three bites, I got it. I just didn't need ten more spoonfuls of the stuff to make the point. It's easy to have lots of leftovers here.\\n\\nAnd therein lies the difference to me: In Austin's trendy haute cuisine world of \\"Head-to-Tail-Farm-to-Table-Organic-Sustainable-Stuff-You've-Never-Seen-on-a-Plate-Before\\" restaurants, Salty Sow puts two or three clever things on a plate and you get lots of it, Barley Swine puts eight or nine clever things together and you get tastes of it. You tell me what you prefer. Remember, you can get as many plates as you want.\\n\\nIf it's nouveau cuisine night in Hipsterville and we want reservations - then let's head to Salty Sow or Swift's Attic. But if we've got the time to hang out at Lick's or Henri's or Horseshoe while waiting for a table - then let's go to Barley. Six of one, half-dozen of another. There's probably a memo out there detailing which one is better and why, but I've missed it. If you come across it, shoot me a copy - I'll probably be hanging out waiting at Lick."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this restaurant .

There were a number of things that were just terrible with today's experience.\\n\\nFirst, the price has increased 9.5% on the dishes that we usually get.  The prices here were already high compared to other local Thai places, so an increase of that much is pretty substantial.  The increase seemed to pay for unnecessary new equipment for the restaurant.  There's now a large flat panel display when you walk in that shows pictures of some dishes on the menu.  Really?  Why is that at all necessary?  It's distracting.  There also seems to be some new POS equipment.\\n\\nWhen placing the order on the phone, it was odd that they now ask for a last name.  It's not a big deal, of course, but it almost seemed like they were tracking us.  I'm guessing their new system is part of the reason for this.\\n\\nMost importantly, the food was terrible today.  Not just bad as compared to what we're used to, but just bad.  I ordered my dish medium and the boyfriend ordered his very spicy.  His had almost no spice to it and mine was on the hot end of spicy.  It's possible they just confused the two, but even if that was the case it would have been wrong.  More importantly, though, it was cooked poorly.  The vegetables were almost raw and the chicken was inedible.  Seriously, this was the first time I could think of that I actually wasn't willing to eat the chicken in my Thai dish.  I know I'm a little picky about chicken, but the boyfriend took it and even commented that it was \\"almost jerky.\\"\\n\\nI can drive into town and pick up food from Monsoon that is much more consistent in quality (not perfect, but much better) and still pay less even when you factor in the gas.

I've been to TLV several times now and everything I tried have been very good...tacos, nachos, quesadilla and enchiladas.  I've figured out the green salsa (mild) is the right amount of heat for me.  If you like heat, they have some red salsas.  I like to have my taste buds in tact ;-)  TLV is very reasonable too...I've never spent more than $8   for a meal there.

Due to an event earlier in the day, I had misplaced my ID so I used my veterans ID. Well that wasn't good enough and they had to call a manager. Well I was upset since it is a valid ID anywhere and has my SS and Birthday on it. Naturally I was upset over the BS that they had to call a manager. Well when JILL showed up, I said that never had I been singled out like this, and that it was pathetic. She went on to say it was company policy, but that's after I found my Oregon ID. She continued to instigate the matter and then said and I quote, \\"Do you want to hit me\\". As a veteran who is under psychiatric care, that is the worst thing you want to say. She then called security on me for saying that they treat veterans like crap. So this is how Yard House treats their veteran's, and customers!!!!! All over an ID issue that was really no issue at all. Security followed me all over the block and if it wasn't for my wife things might have gotten bad... for them, and obviously me as well. I tell all my fellow beer lovers and fellow beer veteran's STAY AWAY from this place. They have no idea what we have done, nor care. It is obvious in how the GM or AGM would react to a veteran which they know nothing about. If it wasn't for my wife I might have acted and that would have made the news.

The staff were apologetic and sheepish around us, but we just waited awkwardly for the last dishes.  Spoiled the evenijng.

Seafood noodles were burnt and the beijing pork chops had too much vinegar sour taste and not enough sweet.\\n\\nLast time we were here, the waiters took our order to another table, and the guests there willing took the dish, even though they already had one plate of pea pod tips on their table - this for a table with only two diners.\\n\\nNext time, we will try another place.

Ya gotta satisfy those munchies!  Anyways, about TILT:\\n\\n~ Dining and Atmosphere:  A slightly dark type of bar.  Set up like you're walking into a factory.  Really unique in it's own right actually.  Reminded me of a few bars in Vancouver.  Mostly bar stools and a few booths.  Patio seating also available.  \\n\\n~ Service:  Excellent service provided by Mario.  Took my order and provided what ever I asked for.  \\n\\n~ My 8pm Breakfast:\\n- Fried Chicken, Pickles & Tilt Sauce ($8):  This was a huge homemade biscuit which was nice and buttery.  Stuffed with a deep fried breaded chicken breast, and if I recall had a nice little sweetness to it.  And DAMN all together with that Tilt sauce was just freakin' amazing!  To go with that, I also had to try a few sides: \\n- Handicrafted Jalapeno Tots (6 pieces / $4):  Hot but not too hot imo.  They were almost like hashbrowns moulded together with jalapeno slices rolled up in a ball.  Crunchy on the outside, potatoey totty on the inside.  \\n- Original Handicrafted Cheddar Tots (6 pieces / $4):  Just as good a the jalapeno ones only made with cheese!  I had to try these!  Both tots were perfect with that Tilt sauce!  You can't go wrong ordering tots here. \\n\\nOh yeah, and the beer.  They had a decent selection of microbrews with various prices.  I gave a couple of IPAs a try;  The Maiden the Shade and Klamath Basin.  Both $5 each, and went well with my grub!  Eating here was a great introduction to Portland's brewery scene.

Great bark, nice peppery taste, so moist and so dang tender. Glad we doubled up on brisket. Beef ribs were like a fattier version of the brisket with more bark, loved those too. The pulled pork was pretty awesome as well, it had a spice rub component to it that made me want more. It was served dry (as it should be) with just a small shot of sauce on top at the last minute by the meat cutter. The pork ribs were also on point, they had just enough texture to them to keep them balanced while still being moist and tender. \\n\\nThe sides: The coleslaw was a bit on the spicy side, I usually prefer slaw to cool things off but I still liked it. Potato salad was good. We also ordered the smoked mac and cheese which someone in line told us was an off the menu item and it was great.

They also have an interesting selection of sushi and rolls. \\n\\nSo for appetizers, our group started off with the typical Calamari as well as Lobster Crab and Artichoke Dip. The dip was tasty--- not too much on the crab or lobster, but did have a nice flavor. The calamari would be typical of a chain restaurant in that it was quite breaded and a bit salty. \\n\\nFor my main course, I had the Gardein Rice Bowl which tasted like fried chicken strips over rice. Very flavorful and high in protein. My colleague ordered the seared Ahi Sushimi which looked amazing. \\n\\nFor craft/draught beer, if you like high ABV or hoppy style brews, I recommend the Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA.

The reason we have tried something new each time is because we've yet to find a single confection that wasn't a huge disappointment. Yes, everything is vegan which is why I've tried to keep an open mind to something that can't quite be the real thing. But, it's quite clear there is nothing worth eating here (and certainly not worth paying higher prices  for) even if it is vegan. \\n\\nBrief example: the consistency of their cake is like super dense bread soaked in vegetable oil. I understand vegan baked goods just can't be as fluffy and creamy as their buttery, egg filled counterparts, but this doesn't excuse the disproportionate levels of sugar and oil oozing out of each bite.\\n\\nBut hey, they do have a super cute interior and atmosphere. So if that's all you care about, you'll probably like it just fine. But if you're looking for irresistibly delicious treats, try elsewhere."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"8801 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Quick service.

As a Portlander, the first thing you notice when you leave town is the quality and variety of beer plummets. So imagine my surprise when I realized I could select a wide variety of PNW IPAs from Yard House's 100 taps? With a great happy hour with cheap appetizers and dollar off pints, I was in heaven.\\n\\nNow there is a Yard House in downtown Portland, and it has everything that one in Vegas has. And yet my take is different since it's Portland. Funny how that happens. The great thing about Yard House is that they are a bastion of great bear, which is great in places not known for great beer. But Portland? There's great beer everywhere, in literally hundreds of great local little pubs and restaurants and even food cart pods. In Portland a place like Yard House is simply less appealing. In Portland it's a place for tourists and out-of-towners, who sadly will experience the beer capital of the universe in a chain restaurant.\\n\\nTL;DR: Yard House is great when it's not in Portland.

A lovely gal at a Starbucks recommended Petunia's when we asked where we should go for lunch. So we arrived here and, for the most part, we had a good meal.\\n\\n(I suspect this place's desserts and pastries are more in demand than their meals, but our dishes were quite good. I had no idea this was a \\"vegan\\" place until now, reading the other reviews here).\\n\\nThe place is cute as a button, with lots and lots of cotton-candy pink, from the wall colors to the tops worn by the ladies who work here. There's even a pink ceramic pig's head mounted on high on the wall above a door frame (\\"Petunia\\", I presume!). \\n\\nLooking at the menu, I was impressed that this restaurant offered cocktails, beers and wines. There was a small selection of salads and sandwiches (my kid ordered a pesto and mozzarella and tomato sandwich, and I ordered a beet salad with goat cheese). Our meals were quite good: fresh, well prepared, perhaps portions were a tad on the small side but still more than ample enough for us. \\n\\nWe didn't have any of the cakes or desserts, but man, we salivated over them in the display case. Just gorgeous! And amazing cookies and bars, too! There was a party of four beside us (two young ladies and their parents) and initially one huge slice of cake was placed on their table by one of the girls and my kid and I ogled this cake, commenting how fabulous it looked and how big it was, how smart this family was to share one piece. But then the remaining three people in that party brought three separate pieces of cake on separate plates to their table! So each person had their own piece! I can't impress upon you how big these cake slices were. I couldn't believe it. But I digress..... all the cakes looked amazing, and the cake portions were likewise. \\n\\nA few caveats about this place: there aren't many seats in this small restaurant, fyi. Also, once we placed our order and paid, then grabbed the last bistro table available, we waited a long, long time for our food to be ready. It was a good 20 minute wait. And we're talking about a sandwich and a salad here. Lastly, the bathroom situation is....odd. You need to obtain a door code from the folks behind the counter, then go through a door that opens to a long and  darkened hallway, then plug in the code on the women's' bathroom door (it's obviously a shared bathroom with the other businesses/offices in this building. The bathroom itself - once inside - is quite nice). Afterwards, when exiting the BR, you must again walk down the long dark hallway, then you have to exit the whole building, to the street, then RE-ENTER Petunia's again (you can't re-enter the restaurant via the internal door). It's strange, and not ideal if it's pouring rain or cold outside (especially if you left your coat inside by your table). I suppose Portland natives are used to this set-up, with shared BR's in buildings, but my kid and I was not. \\n\\nThese are minor issues. The food here was great - especially the desserts, and we'd return, for sure."},{"name":"Take Thai Home","address":"1736 Commercial Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Used to be better.

They have an open kitchen on the first floor, lounge-like area on the second floor, and restrooms in the basement. I ordered the marinated filet mignon steak tips, while my friends ordered the Ahi Tuna BLT and the Truffle Burger. The portions were large with a more than generous side of mashed potatoes, while the sandwich and burger came with their famous fries.

Located on East Hastings and Nanaimo street,  this neighbour joint serves up a delightful and hearty brunch.  With its simple diner d√©cor, Chinese serving plates and 70s music selection, this retro cafe definitely transported us back in time.\\n\\nWe arrived at  1:30pm and the restaurant was packed - we waited for 20 mins before we were seated.  By the time the order was placed, it was already 2pm and we were both starving. The service was not attentive but our waitress was friendly - we had to ask for water, coffee refills, cream, jam, peanut better, ketchup......The food also took a long time - 35 mins before we were served - but it was totally worth the wait!!!!\\n\\nFor Brunch, we had\\n\\nCrispy Pork Belly ( $10.95) - Confit pork belly, two eggs any style, griddled tomatoes, salsa verde, hollandaise, home fries and toast. This is TO DIE FOR - it's a must try. The pork belly was nicely crisped on the outside but soft and tender inside. It had a nice texture - layers of \\" melt in your mouth\\" pork fat and moist meat - done just right not too heavy.  My eggs were perfectly poached - yolks oozing out combined with hollandaise, salsa verde and pork belly - a bite of  heaven.\\n\\nTwo eggs any style ($6.95) - Served with choice of bacon or sausage, home fries and toast.  We ordered scambled eggs - it was soft, fluffy and buttery. The breakfast sausage was average but the home fries were crispy and flavourful. This dish is  the best value on the menu - only $6.95.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the brunch menu at The Red Wagon very much. If you are looking for a fancy brunch spot with a patio to gossip with your girlfriends, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for good comfort/diner food, this is the place to be.\\n\\nFood - 4 stars ( based on Brunch)\\nAmbiance - 3 stars\\nD√©cor - 2 1/2 stars\\nService - 3 stars\\nValue - 4 stars"},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Ok, so I ordered the smothered chicken and greens and mac n cheese.

I usually order burgers medium-rare and Nick's gets it just right, juicy and still a bit red inside. A simple burger with lettuce, tomato and mayo is completely satifying, but I often get it with swiss cheese and mushrooms, or a cheeseburger club on wheat when I'm jonesing for bacon.

The first two were near perfect dining experiences, as the food was top notch in terms of both taste and presentation, and the ambiance was ideal for a romantic dinner. The unique layout of the restaurant as well as the interior decor and setting provide an experience similar to that of having a serviced dinner inside a museum. Their service had been excellent on those prior visits. However, it seems it is Mamma Maria's service that does suffer on holidays and holiday weekends as we too experienced some unpleasantness during our last visit. \\n\\nI had made reservations nearly a month in advance and had requested that we be seated near a window overlooking the North End Square. I was told they would do their best to accommodate. Our reservations were for 8:00 and we arrived about 10 minutes early to have our reservation confirmed and our coats checked in, but then left to wonder if we were going to be seated as the host had vanished. There were some seats in the hallway for patrons waiting for their tables, so we found a few spots and waited. More people started arriving and it quickly got crowded. I found the host and asked about our reservation and he said they were still seating the 7:30 parties. We waited and waited, all the while noticing couples and other parties who arrived after us being seated before us. I figured this was due to my special table request. After about 20 minutes or so, we were finally seated at a table near a window, but in a room at the back of the restaurant at a window blocked with a heavy curtain. At first I was annoyed, but then let it go as it was rather busy there and our table was actually in a good spot next to a wall in a quiet room.\\n\\nThe waiter was extremely nice and passionate about his service. He was very helpful in providing menu recommendations and meeting our needs. The only hiccup was when he took a long time to take our food order. This too I let go as it appeared he was covering all the tables in our room, so it was clear he was a bit overwhelmed. \\n\\nOtherwise, everything else was as we expected. We found the Valentine's Day menu to be of good value and selection. The food we ate up completely as it was so tasty we had to finish everything. \\n\\nI haven't been to many restaurants in the North End, but compared to the three or four that I have tried, both on Hanover Street and off the side streets, Mamma Maria is by far the best. It is Northern Italian cuisine, so as long as you don't go expecting the traditional spaghetti and meatballs, you'll have an incredible food experience.  Avoid going on the holidays and you'll have an incredible experience overall."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Checked out Bin 26 tonight after seeing that it was one of the best hidden secrets in Beacon Hill.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict \\"California style\\" with a tomato and avocado. Why can't they just call it \\"Austin Style\\"? We like tomatoes and avocados in Austin.  Let's not give the Californians another reason to think they're cool.  One of my favorite things about Eggs Benedict is breaking into a nice runny yolk which melts into the Hollandaise sauce. My eggs however, were hard boiled. No runny yolk in sight. The waiter asked me if he could bring me new eggs and quite frankly I wanted to scream, \\"There aren't any other customers in here- tell the sorry excuse of a chef to do it right the first time!!!!!!!!!!!\\" Also, the husband asked for crispy bacon and it came out barely cooked. He asked for it to be crispier and they took his whole plate back. They returned a few minutes later with bacon that still wasn't crispy and the eggs were now burned. I suppose they put the whole plate in the broiler? Why not just leave his plate and bring a side of crispy bacon? Crispy means crispy! You should be able to crumble it.\\n\\nOn a side note, the decor is hideous. They have three different artists on display which creates chaos and confusion and while they have several windows, they leave the shutters closed which creates a dark, somber feeling.

Like so skeptical. Hungover on a Sunday morning while visiting friends in Boston, Jill E. dragged Isabel M. and I here on the promise of delicious brunch. We begrudgingly followed her knowing there was no bacon on the menu...but were pleasantly surprised by our delicious meal! \\n\\nVeggie Galaxy seems to have a ton of tables for parties of 2, so your best bet to get seated quickly is with a smaller party. We ended up waiting about a half hour on a Sunday around 12:00. The decor in Veggie Galaxy is a bit odd, definitely diner-themed, but a little bit sad and hokey in the back where we were sitting. I think it would be nice for them to paint the walls and upgrade the decor in the back of the restaurant. We waited a while for our waitress to come over and when she did, she was pretty abrupt and not too friendly. That actually surprised me a lot because the two hosts were incredibly friendly. For breakfast, I went with the Western Ave omelet that included brussel sprouts, portobello, asiago cheese, and sun dried tomato pesto. I actually subbed goat cheese for the asiago which gave the omelet a TON of flavor. The omelet came with lots of veggies inside, all cooked to perfection. The breakfast potatoes that accompanied it were also really tasty. \\n\\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend Veggie Galaxy for vegans and vegetarians. I don't think I've ever seen a restaurant cater to vegans so well. Jill's vegan pancakes looked and tasted just like the real thing, which she can never get at any other breakfast establishment.

The chef said that his was the only Mauritius restaurant in the US; so that was pretty cool.  I was not  too hungry (on account of the 3 food trucks I visited before this one), so I thought I'd get the veggie curry with the puri.  What I was expecting was a bowl of curry and a couple of puris to dip in it.  What I got were two Mauritian burritos each weighing over 1.5lbs.  (I might not be exaggerating).  It's possible that had I ordered a noodle or rice base, the curry would be the liquid type.  But with the puri, the curry was thickened with potatoes.  Was it good?  Yes.  But I had an entire evening of eating planned out, and with this dish, I hit the proverbial wall.  I will definitely be back though!  Next time, I will try it hot.  Hubs was feeling heart burn-ey so didn't want to go higher than medium, but I tasted no spiciness at all.

My wife and I saw the reviews and we were on our way.  Where we live, there is not any Thai restaurants so we were excited for this place.  We arrived and the place looked inviting both on the outside and in.  Casual atmosphere and very nice staff.  Already a good start.  \\n\\nWe sit and are given the menu's and we chose the Tempura Calamari and Basil Rolls to start.  The items come out and at first glance...not very large, but petite.  Ok, these are just starters.  The calamari was hard but edible and the rolls were bland.  They don't stand on their own, so give them a healthy dose of the dip they provide.  Ta da!  Now they are bearable.\\n\\nFor our main dish, we saw the Crab Fried Rice and the last place we seen this dish was in the motherland and it was great.  So we ordered it along with some Tom Tom Soup (ok, so I forgot the actual name).  We figured we could share these items.  They come out and again...hmm petite.  The soup was very small and barely enough to have a taste.  The crab fried rice on the other hand was a decent serving, but still on the smaller side.  The soup was OK as was the fried rice.\\n\\nOverall, the staff was very attentive and the meal was ok.  Do not come here thinking you will get full unless you order more than a few things on the menu.

We like this place better than Dumpling House, Taiwan Cafe, and Dumpling Cafe. \\n\\nWe ordered 3 dishes:\\n1. Red Sou Fish Casserole: This dish was delicious. It contains large chunks of tofu and fried fish all cooked together in a light sauce. The dish was served bubbling hot in a casserole pot.\\n\\n2. Salt & Pepper Pork Ribs: OK, this was the best dish. It is far better than the same dish ordered at Dumpling House and Taiwan Cafe. The main reason is that this dish here is really made of pork \\"ribs,\\" where they give you large pieces of pork still attached to the bone. The problem with this dish at other restaurants is that they just deep fry some strips of pork, and you're basically just getting leftover pork pieces served to you. Definitely get this here.\\n\\n3. Stir fried green beans: Well made, and the sauce is on the sweet side with soy sauce. \\n\\nOverall, I think this is my new favorite place in Chinatown, and the prices were super reasonable! By the way, the portions they give you are also pretty big. Our meal came with free hot tea, and also free dessert (a red bean soup that was sweetened with tapioca balls). \\n\\nFor 2 people, we ordered 3 dishes with rice, and the total (with tax and tip) came to $38. Also, we had leftovers from two dishes to take home.\\n\\nGREAT PLACE!

We were seated behind a column, which is better than by the kitchen but not much.  My view was limited to the wall display behind my husband and to my right.  \\n\\nI couldn't get my head around the decor.  Fish lamps?  OK.  They were cute, but just didn't go with anything else.  Behind my husband was a display of elegantly detailed figurines that were so unique, and so prominent in my limited vision that I ended up staring at them, trying to create a story to explain the wild variances between each piece while we waited for the waiter to eventually remember us and come back.  \\n\\nThere were two generals sitting on rams, facing off as if challenging each other.  There was a fiddler with very exaggerated features.  There was an Italianesque female statue glaring down at another statue of a man who was cuddling a small lamb.  My imagination started going into overdrive.\\n\\nMy husband kept turning around to see what I was frowning at, and then of course I had to explain my thought process, and while we were trying to figure out the position the fiddler was actually in (I had an awkward view of him), another diner noticed our attention on the wall and came over to our table.  He was wearing chef pants, and I about crawled under the table when I realized that if he wasn't the owner of the restaurant, he was at least the owner of the figurines!  He explained they were Italian family heirlooms and very collectible, and then asked if we'd like to see a book about them.  He brought over a book from a nearby shelf, wished us a pleasant evening, and returned to his table, and we admired the detailed pieces in the book until our waiter brought dinner and didn't dare turn around again.  \\n\\nI was disappointed with my meal, as the meat was SWIMMING in what I felt was too much sauce.  I don't want meat soup!  Also, the bread plates drove me batty.  While they were roundish, there was a hole in one side to make it look a bit like a painter's palette.

First, a lovely waft of tasty foods hits your olfactory sense with smells ranging from freshly baked biscuits to various Omelet and egg concoctions to sumptuous turkey meatloaf.  You also may get a feeling of nostalgia as you are struck by the quintessential images of flying biscuits and other fun signature icons of the original Flying Biscuit locations.  With accents in the decor that include quirky murals on the walls and ceiling as well as spicy and colorful tablecloths, this newer location definitely honors its namesake.  Like me, you may also be struck by how open, bright and airy this location feels.  This fresh and clean ambiance is a dynamic feature that sets it apart from its more quaint, rustic sister locations.  If you have not yet experienced this Buckhead location, you will definitely enjoy this contemporary spin on what has become an Atlanta Institution.\\n\\nBuilt in the Shiny new Terminus building, as part of the Buckhead revitalization process, this Flying Biscuit could not be in a better location.  Many folks enjoy a great breaky or lunch in between work hours.  Should you have some guests come into town for a convention, big game or just for the heck of it, and they happen to be staying at the Grand Hyatt right next door, there is no more convenient place to eat!  You can also grab a bite next time you are heading to shop at Phipps or Lenox mall.  Hmmm, hadn't thought of that one yet heh?  What's a better combo than eggs and biscuits paired with a nice pace to walk off your meal as you shop!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe entire Flying Biscuit Terminus experience is pleasurable.  Starting with an easily accessible valet service right outside of its doors (which is free with validation at this Flying Biscuit btw!), to the stellar and personable service, this location has done it the right way across the board.  The servers have all been there since it's inception two years ago, and their loyalty to the restaurant is clear in their upbeat and friendly demeanor.  The waitstaff know many of their customers by name, so clearly repeat customers are a common theme.  The servers are quick and attentive in their approach leaving you finding the dining experience stress free as you crunch on a piece of tasty turkey bacon, or sample the delicious Shrimp and Grits, a Flying Biscuit signature dish.  Speaking of the food, you'll be tickled to learn that Jesus will be making your biscuits!  Well, pronounced the Spanish way, this chef makes the best biscuits in town!  I giggled with one waitress as she helped make the connection between Jesus baking biscuits and the heavenly overtones found in the Flying Biscuit images and artwork found in the restaurant.  In keeping with the somewhat celestial theme of Biscuits flying with angels wings, or a painting of an Angel serving food, I thought it was very appropriate that Jesus be the one to make the biscuits.\\n\\nA few key things not to miss at this particular location are the specials which change every two weeks.  Some of these include the following members of the Pancake family:  Chocolate Chip, Sweet Potato (how interesting and yummy), pumpkin (its that time of year folks, I know, we cant believe it either!) and strawberry-vanilla to name a few.  They also have new selections of their Egg Scramble every two weeks, this week: Lump Crab Meat, Spinach, Mushroom and White Cheddar, quite the delectable combination!  A variety of crisp and flavorful salads await you as well.  In addition to these fine selections (including the wonderful Oatmeal Pancakes - one of the local favorites), there is a nice selection of Healthy meals such as: the Vegan Burrito, Tofu and Taters Salad, and lower fat meats including turkey bacon, turkey sausage and soy-sage.  Something for everyone!\\n\\nThis particular location serves a variety of people.  From the local business-person during the week, to families, and other Atlanta locals from midtown to downtown looking for a change of scene, the Buckhead location is a great choice.  Many a celebrity have shared in this opinion recently including: Cameron Diaz, Ludacris, Katherine Heigl, Charles Barkely and just today, I saw the famous Tight End for the Atlanta Falcons, enjoying a meal with his family.  Much like that cryptic description of my celeb sighting, you'll want to refrain from getting autographs, as the celebs enjoy being able to eat in peace at this location just like you, but you'll definitely enjoy the experience! A recent customer was quoted as saying that \\"of all the Flying Biscuit locations in the city, this one was his absolute, hands down favorite\\".  Pretty strong statement if you ask me, considering the amazing Flying Biscuit lineage."},{"name":"Floramo's Restaurant","address":"213 Everett Ave","city":"Chelsea","stars":"4","text":"Not much else in this area, Floramos limps along with mediocre American-Italian fare.

I grew up Italian and this dish was always pieces of actual chicken on the bone. I shoved the deep-fried chicken slab to the side and just ate the pasta and vegetables.

It had been a little while since I was last here but don't see how a byob burger, fries, drink and a cookie comes out to fifteen dollars and ten cents, didn't get a receipt so don't know exactly what they jumped the price so much on. The burger comes out and looks like it was cooked by someone that does not know how to cook a burger, where they press the hell out of the patty while its cooking, the patty was smashed and broken up. It is supposed to be a stuffed burger but there was about what amounted to a jelly bean worth of cheese in the whole burger. For fifteen dollars, I expect  better and if i'm paying for a stuffed burger that it is stuffed and that I shouldn't have to have a turf war with an inordinate amount of flies, the amount of flies was ridiculous, felt like I was dining on a pile of cow manure. I would rather see dead flies on a fly strip than have to cover my drink with a napkin and keep fighting flies a way from my food.

But the secret to their deliciousness is that the meat is stuffed [insert mom joke]. \\n\\nThe first time I came here, I had a Chi Cheng, and boy was it good. The burger was pleasantly salty, with a touch of sweetness from the teriyaki and heat from the wasabi spread; the meat was fatty enough to be moist, but not to the point of greasiness. A burger does need some grease, and that was taken care of by the cheese. I thought the wonton strips added a nice crunch. I couldn't imagine ordering the burger without the lettuce and tomato, which I thought were abundant enough to add brightness. I really enjoyed the fries. They were seasoned really well and were also thin, which I dig. My friend had a vegan burger; she seemed to like it. \\n\\nThe next time I came, I brought another friend, and we both ordered Norma Jeans. Much more simple, but still awesome, I would definitely order this again.\\n\\nService-wise, it's slow, yeah, but I've found the guys up front to be really friendly.

That being said, the staff were flexible and let us order as little food as we wanted.

It's situated in the same strip mall as Quickly's. On entering(I went there with my boyfriend) we noticed that everyone dining there seem to be quite young(teens and under 30). The waitress quickly had us seated and gave two papers of printed menu.\\n\\nSo this is how it works. There are several sections in their tabulated menu,\\n\\n1) Charcoal grilled skewers\\n2) pan-fried skeweres\\n3) Items you can add to skewers(Customize)\\n4) Entrees items - Buns, dumplings, Noodles, noodle soups , rices and rolls.\\n5) Cold -dishes\\n6) Soup specials\\n7) Hot pots\\n8) beverages and beers\\n\\nYou basically have to write how many you want of each item in the quantity column. If you don't want something, you just leave the qty column blank. Very much like how we order sushi.\\n\\nWe ordered,\\n\\n1) Lamb, beef, chicken, chicken jane(we were told it's chicken gizzard), fish tofu and squid skewers.\\n2) Steam pork buns\\n3) Spicy sliced beef(cold dish)\\n4) Small lamb soup.\\n\\nEven though we enjoyed all skewers, our favorites were chicken jane, squid and chicken - in that order. I loved the texture and taste of the chicken jane. And the seasoning on these skewers were super spicy and appealed to my Indian palate. Also, the spicy-sweet sauce on the squid was a perfection. Fish-tofu was also delicious though we thought beef skewer was dry.\\n\\nThe spicy sliced beef was tender and juicy, served with cilantro leaves on top. It was just not that spicy as the name suggests, in fact it was more salty than spicy. But we liked the beef-cilantro combo. \\n\\nSteam pork buns was a ok dish, there was simply not enough meat inside and also we thought the flavor of the meat was bit off. We can tell it was not the freshest item in the menu. Also, we didn't like the lamb soup at all. The tiny bits of lamb bits inside the soup was tasty enough but the soup tasted very much buttery in not so good way. We were glad we only ordered a small soup.\\n\\nService was generally quick at this place but that's about it.\\n\\nOverall, We liked skewers here very much but other items are more of a miss.

I'm really proud when people embraced the story we were trying to tell.\\" The Salty Sow is an American Gastropub serving farm-to-table eats, where every dish makes you wonder about the story behind it. The contemporary recipes are mindfully sourced from local farms. A hotspot for dinner, this upbeat restaurant just makes you feel Oh So Cool! Happy hour runs from 4:30 - 6:30, and enjoy $2 off your favorite sips. I recommend starting with the Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad. A colorful mound with candied almonds, dried cranberries and Caesar Dressing. To be honest, I was never fond of Brussel Sprouts, but this dish I will eat and lots of it! The Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries is a sight for sore eyes, you feel guilty just looking at it. Topped with two 110- minute poached eggs and cold b√©arnaise, the combination of crunch and gooey makes that odd, yet perfect marriage for your taste buds. Proceed with the Slow-Cooked Beef Shoulder, literally brought to your table in an iron pot, served with Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes and glazed vegetables. In other words, a fancy melt-in-your mouth Pot Roast. But if there is one item that will keep me coming back is dessert. The Bananas Foster Beignets are to die for!

I was greatly surprised as to why I would come here again = EGG TART.\\n\\nThis place by far has taken it to the top of my egg tart craving. Not overly sweet, nice soft custard texture, far from hard jello, and a very flaky pastry like crust, the sense of butter and hot out of the oven, these bad boys came first at the table before the savory delights, and due to our stomachs being hungry, we decided to eat these first, not a wrong move at all. There was a point during lunch I wanted to order a second batch, but that was my taste buds talking and not my overly full stomach. \\n\\nThe dim sum was pretty good here, and after all the slack this place has gotten from others, I can say that either they have heard the complaints, or they just changed up their whole kitchen staff. Another reason to come here, free tea, and 20% off, your not going to find a better deal for dim sum in Richmond, and it is not crap your paying for, it is actually decent food. \\n\\nThe place is pretty big, seating wise with the main room, and some side private rooms that they fill up tables in them, and you may be seated there too. Just get here early, as I think most people also know about the egg tarts, free tea, 20%, and if you don't mind waiting, then you have been warned!\\n\\nLast thing is the parking, as it is multi level, and the spots are tight, if you find one, don't bother circling up the lot, you may get stuck!"},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Epic Fail.

The meal also came with fortune cookies and white rice. \\n\\nThe chicken in the lemon chicken dish was surprisingly good, better quality than I expected. Most places use cheap, fatty chicken in battered and fried dishes. The sauce itself was pretty tasty, although the flavor amplified as it congealed and cooled, making it less appetizing. The sauce comes separate though, so you can add as much or as little as you want. I hate beef and broccoli as a rule, and this was no exception. My roommate liked it though. The shrimp fried rice was probably the highlight of the meal, we both enjoyed it immensely and it lasted the shortest of the three dishes. I liked the wontons, although my roommate didn't, I felt they were pretty typical though. We ended up tossing the eggroll after getting super full. The hot and sour soup was a disappointment.

But I suppose that's not a fair assessment, since I've tried so few other places because I go here almost every time I'm in the North End.\\n\\nI go here mostly for their lunch specials. At $5.95, it was the best bargain in town. Only recently have they increased it to $6.95. Still, for the money, you get a large plate filled with food. I get the lunch special sampler - a generous selection of up to the five lunch specials of the day. And if you don't want to try all five, they'll give you larger portions of the ones you do select. I've only had dinner here once, and the portions were generous for dinner, too. And their calamari is excellent - they only serve calamari rings. I can't eat the calamari that looks like squid - those tentacles freak me out.

Around the walls, you'll find memorabilia and photos of her on stage.  The dining area is clean, organized and has perfect lighting.  The food, now, was exceptional.  You can tell that alot of care and attention has gone into some of these recipes.  The corn bread is the best that I've had anywhere.  I also had the best waffle I've ever had: the cinnamon apple waffle.  Completely blew me away.  That sweet taste from the waffle goes so well with fried chicken.  Whomever first made that combination should get an award of some kind.  The mac and cheese was the 2nd best I've ever had, and the squash casserole was something I had never tried and that amazed me as well.  Although I prefer fried chicken to be spicy, this is the best job that I've tasted on non-spicy fried chicken.  The second you bite into it, you can taste a world of difference from this chicken and the average chicken you have.  My only criticism from this place is their efficiency.  We waited 30 minutes for a table and it wasn't because the place was completely packed to capacity, it was because when someone leaves, it takes them a very long time to clear the table and sit the next person in line.  There was a point where we looked around and saw 7 tables open while the lobby was packed with hungry humans.  I tried to see if there was a busser and I don't think there was.  I think not having a busser can really make waiting times get bad because then you have to rely on the hostess and servers to clear the table.  Having been a server myself, I can say that we weren't exactly anxious to clean our tables as fast as possible.  It truly was, however, my best soul food experience in a long time since I last ate chicken and waffles in Harlem.  I can say with confidence that someone visiting would really be pleased with the food here."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite eateries while in the Boston area.

I was staring at the boyfriend to get his attention, but he was busy working on his blackberry. I then looked up to see if she was taste-testing our food - I was seriously confused. But then she came at me as if I was a toddler learning to eat solid foods and the bread filled with awesome was a plane coming in for a landing in my face. I was caught so off guard that I literally opened my mouth in shock and BLAM! There was a handful of food stuffed into it.  - I think this is a normal thing, where they feed the guests the first bite?- Fingers-crossed, i hope it is, because that would just make it awkward. It never happened again, so I'm still confused about this situation. Anywho, the FOOD! It's so tasty, there are so many different spices, and it's a choose your own adventure kinda meal.

Between the avocado curry and their yellow curry, I'd definitely go for the yellow, which is pretty mild, but carries a lot of flavor. You can get a small size with rice or a large size without rice.\\n\\nFor the most part (and I guess how hungry you are) the portion sizes are pretty generous. If you want to avoid waiting in line, I'd recommend calling in your order for pick up.

Food is okay. Service mediocre. Environment inhospitable. Management troubled.I had a hankering for sashimi but I was with a guy who is new to the whole raw fish thing, so we took our time ordering. We started with a Kirin while we poured over the menu. We ordered two maki rolls, a bowl of hot and sour, pot stickers, and one main dish of sashimi, which, according to the menu, was supposed to be eleven pieces of tuna. I asked a lot of questions of the waitress, who didn't speak much English. How many pieces? What kind of tuna? Well, when the food showed (all at once -- what's with that? haven't they heard of food served in courses?), all was as expected except for the sashimi, which was five pieces short of eleven. And they were small pieces. Long story short, the very young manager came over to tell us that it was this or nothing or he could take it back and slice the tuna even smaller so that it would be eleven. I've eaten plenty of tuna sashimi and these were small to begin with. He wouldn't budge. Even his waitress with the poor English skills thought he was being silly. Which he was. I mean, the menu was clear.  I finally said, okay, bring us two more beers on the house. He said, okay, and they did. But he was ridiculous. And then, to make matters worse, all the employees came over and ate dinner at a table adjacent to ours (like not even four feet away), in a large nearly empty restaurant. This isn't Chinatown. This is the burbs. They have plenty of rooms in the restaurant which is cavernous. Given that, there's no excuse for putting  a loud table of workers next to paying customers. Was this the manager showing us he was pissed? What an idiot. This kind of thing -- all of this -- is usually a sign that the restaurant isn't long for the land of the living. It was cold, too. Like they're too cheap to run the heater in November. Part of me doesn't want to give it a bad review because when this place goes belly up, where else where I get sashimi in the hinterlands?

It is well known for having a quieter, more intimate ambiance.  The beautiful bar/lounge area was renovated recently.  The menu is a bit of Cali-Italian, with the obligatory cured meat and cheeses, flour+water stuff, and additional entrees that are a little European, a little Southern.  Very similar to places like Ecco and No. 246, which makes sense since Floataway's old chef Drew Beline went on to open No. 246.  \\n\\nI've eaten here before the renovation, when Beline still cooked here.  Then more recently, our dinner was with and described in detail by the ever lovely miss Han L.  I don't need to add much detail to what she's already described.  Instead will just comment qualitatively.  The high standard of service and execution you would expect from a Star Provision restaurant is there.  It is more expensive than either Ecco or No. 246.  There's a lot of wines under $35 a bottle, awesome.  Desserts are fabulous, and I don't even normally like desserts!  These days, it tends to get lost in the shuffle even though it kind of does everything right, because of the boom of similar places (LPC, Double Zero, No. 246, Ecco etc) in the last few years.  If I have to have the amazing blue crab fritter, or a well executed bistro entree, Floataway might pop into my mind, but if it's good pizza or pasta, or house cured meat and fine cheeses, there's a lot of places.  Also the adventurous eaters have a few options these days like Octopus Bar, One Eared Stag, or maybe even Star Provision's own Abattoir.  Gastro pubs did not exist 6~7 years ago, and those places are also taking away certain type of eater who didn't have as many choices before.  Also, paradoxically, even though the food style is on  the casual side, Floataway's atmosphere makes it feel like you have to dress up and make it an occasion to eat there.  So there's pro and con in that.  \\n\\nIn the end, kudos to the great food, service, and atmosphere.

To sum it up at the beginning, the food is bland and the service is horrible.\\nWe made a reservation for a Sunday night and planned to meet some friends there with our 3 young boys.  Yelp says it is good for kids :)\\nWe arrive, and the wonderful lady at the front door seats us upstairs, and says she will keep a lookout for the rest of our party.  We sit down, our friends arrive, and we are meeting new acquaintances, so we are more into our conversation than the menu.  My husband and I have ordered drinks already, and I am drinking a lemondrop martini that has no flavor.\\nOur waitress comes back and demands our order.  She was very rude, impatient, and demanding.  Not helpful when it came to questions about the menu, clearly she is just in this for the money (thinking she is getting an automatic 18% of our bill...)  Now, I don't expect these older Italian waitresses to be a walk in the park, most of them aren't, and we find it amusing.  But they usually don't lack when it comes to service.\\nFood comes.  I ordered the Rosa with fettuccine and a sausage and meatball on the side.  The fettuccine is overcooked, the rosa sauce is tasteless, as is the sausage.  The best part of my meal was the meatball, and that wasn't the best I have ever had.  My kids end up with spaghetti and meatball portions good enough for an adult (even though we asked her if they could split it - never got a straight answer).  My husband ordered Chicken parm that was HUGE and just ok, the penne was much better than the fettuccine.\\nAt one point, my brother in law asked for water, and I thought she was going to rip his head off.  Dividing up the check should be fun...\\nSo the check comes and we decide that we will split one meal out, the others will pay cash, and we will ask her to take the gratuity off, since once our food came, she NEVER came back.

Innitially I tried to order pizza from Southside about a year ago. I was told I was out of the delivery area. No biggie. Pizza Hut it is. I was bartending one night last month and the owner came in and asked if I had been there. I told him that they said they wouldn't deliver to me. He asked where I lived and found out I was only one block out of the area, so he gave me a card saying \\"free medium pizza delivered to\\" such and such part of town. When I ordered the pizza, the girl said they wouldn't deliver to me. I explained I had the card, so she took our order and was really nice. About an hour later our delivery driver shows up. He gets out of the car and proceeds to give my boyfriend attitude about how we are out of the delivery area. We were dumbfounded. My honey showed him that we had a card from the owner and his attitude shaped up, but it was really a little late for that. We had ordered $40 worth of pizza, and planned on tipping the guy $20 for bringing us the food, which we knew was technically \\"out of the area\\"  by one block. So, even though the guy was a jerk, we still gave him the $20, probably the biggest tip he had seen delivering pizza. When we opened the pizza box, the pizza was folded in half...seriously...in half. In hindsight, we probably shouldn't have even eaten it. Clearly that guy was pissed he had to drive three more minutes out of his way. Who knows what he did to that pie.

Luckily for me I didn't have to use my Sunday afternoon brain to decide; the sandwich is only available during the week.\\n\\nThe two thick pieces of pork belly were melt-in-your-mouth buttery, crispy on the one side and deliciously fatty on the other. Both sat atop a half a roasted tomato that helped cut the richness of the pork belly between bites. The eggs were covered in a mildly spicy salsa verde and the home fried potatoes drizzled in a tiny bit hollandaise. Before going I had read a few reviews that found the potatoes bland. They were right, the potatoes did not have much flavour, but a little table salt fixed that quickly.\\n\\nMy trusted brunch partner, Adam, ordered the Pulled Pork Pancakes with Jack Daniels maple syrup ($12.50). While I personally find pancakes too heavy to make an entire meal out of, I could definitely see myself ordering these, perhaps to share, next time. The Jack Daniels gave these hardy pancakes a serious boozy edge while the pulled pork added a richness and toned down the starchiness of the thick, fluffy pancakes.\\n\\nIt wasn't until we were paying our bill that we noticed a handwritten sign on the wall above our table advertising $5 mimosas, caesars or Red Wagon (boozy) lemonade.

They brought out 2 huge lobsters which were boiled and then cooked in a ginger and scallion sauce. I wish they had brought out one of those seafood shell cracker-thing-a-ma-jiggys cuz it would've helped to eat some of the smaller pieces. But overall, the lobster was cooked fine and the sauce was good.\\n\\nMy mom insisted on getting the seafood treasure nest. Scallop, shrimp and calamari inside a taro pastry shell with a light sauce.

The chain's success has made the chicken & waffles concept a developmental factor to Atlanta's culinary identity, stemming from the homey Southern spin placed on the original chicken & waffles idea.\\n\\nSaul and I visited the downtown Atlanta location on a Wednesday evening, and eagerly endured a 5-10 minute wait to sit down.\\n\\nWe opted for buffalo chicken spring rolls ($7.99) for our Spring Roll Sampler appetizer. The piping hot rolls came sliced on the diagonal and served with a creamy and cooling ranch dipping sauce. They were pretty spicy (for my taste), though not overbearing. While the spring rolls were delicious however, in the end I deemed them not worth the price.\\n\\nAfter a 10-15 minute wait, our entr√©es arrived. The Midnight Train ($13.50), one of the most popular dishes on the menu), consisted of four southern fried jumbo chicken wings and one original waffle. I doused the plate with hot sauce and syrup and took a bite. Holy crap, the chicken was perfectly fried and crispy. It was a little tough to eat both the chicken and the waffle at the same time, so we ditched the silverware and dove in with our fingers. There were moments of silence where Saul and I were just eating.\\n\\nThe waffle definitely needed the syrup and/or hot sauce to spruce it up, and it grew soggy towards the end of the meal, but I still finished it. The dish came with a slice of orange thoughtfully placed on the side to clean your palate and to provide a bit of freshness amidst all the fried food.\\n\\nWhile I wish the meal came with some sort of vegetable, I found that this restaurant is great for indulging. In fact, this would be a perfect late night joint, because this restaurant doesn't shut down for the evening until 4AM on the weekends. If you're looking for high-quality \\"drunchies\\" and are willing to pay a bit more than what you're used to, then head here for a special meal.\\n\\nMy advice? Ditch the distractions and focus on the star dish of the restaurant, the chicken & waffles. The food here is generally a bit overpriced for the portion size and quality, with the exception of the chicken.\\n\\nOur meal came to be $20 each, tip not included. I was happy to pay because the restaurant did a genuinely great job with the chicken & waffles, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting.

I cheated on Bar La Grassa with this absolutely phenomenal restaurant in Vancouver. Do not believe any of the bad reviews, this place is worth the 4.5 hour plane ride from Minnesota. When I come back to Vancouver this will always be my first place to eat, hands down. We arrived late on a Thursday evening (around 9:30pm) and the place was still hopping, which is always a good sign. The restaurant is a converted home, which adds to the charm and the warmth of the restaurant. The hostess was impeccable and greeted/seated us quickly while taking our coats. We started off with their house special (which they should just add to their menu because it was so stinking good). It was cow milk mozzarella with golden beets. The cheese was so good you wanted to just rub it on your face. Light, creamy and tasty. And you would think you can't tell the difference between cow milk mozzarella and goat milk mozzarella, you are wrong! We then had two of the primos. One was the house special (again, just add this to the menu) it was ravioli with rabbit and bison (I think) in brown butter and the other was their seafood risotto. Oh my sweet holy moly, that ravioli is so good you might want to slap your mom. It was just amazing, rich, meaty fantasticness. The seafood risotto had so much seafood in it, you would think you were just swimming around in the ocean with your mouth open. Every single piece of seafood was fresh tasting, not buried in butter and cheese. We ended this superb meal with their pear tart (also a special, also should just go on the menu). It was absolutely wonderful! It did (in a good way) remind me of a McDonald's apple pie, weird, but those are tasty too. The entire meal start to finish was wonderful. The ambiance and service was fantastic and the FOOD! Ah-may-zing! That is all I can say!

We then placed our drink order- 3 cocktails and 1 beer.  After waiting 20-25 minutes the waiter came over and apologized for the delay and told us that the drink order tickets were overwhelming.  He then had us put out appetizer order in...That came out quickly, still no drinks. He then asked for our meal order....that came out, still no drinks. The entrees were mostly tacos- which were so minute and awful tasting, it was a complete waste.  It was literally enough for 2 bites each, no rice, no beans, nothing, just 4 total bites of garbage. While continually waiting we finally grabbed the \\"manager\\" if you even want to call him that.  We requested that if it is quicker we will order all  beers, specifically a round of Corona, he then waited about 10 minutes to bring over a warm half full pitcher of Sam Summer. Finally after 1 hour (this is no exaggeration) our drinks came out.  Once we finished our drink we asked for the check....They had the nerve to charge us for all of the drinks we initially ordered. \\n\\nAlso, one other note- They had people waiting to be seated with seats open, simply stating that their kitchen cannot handle the volume of a full restaurant....Just to top it off, as we were walking away we heard them announce to a large party that they were out of Corona (at 6:00pm).\\n\\nI thought we were being punked or on a new show on the Food Network depicting restaurants going out of business."},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been twice now just to make sure of my first impression and because the food was very, very tasty.  This is a tough place to review because the trailer feels like a transitional stage until they get the permanent location up and running.  \\n\\nThe menu and presentation of the food are a step or two above even the most generous definition of  \\"trailer food.\\"  Plenty has been made of this place's pedigree, but none of that matters if it doesn't show up on the plate.  \\n\\nThe good news is that food is creative, fresh, and, without exception, tasty.  Any place that can make a good cold soup has a special place in my heart, and both of the chilled soups I've had at El Naranjo have been aces.  The gazpacho was spicier than the traditional spanish version and much better for it.  However, the big winner is the cucumber and yogurt soup.  It's every bit as refreshing as it sounds, but there was a marvelous bite of chile pepper that burned the lips just a tiny bit.  It's really exceptional.\\n\\nThe molotes oaxaquenos are everything you'd hope fried cornmeal stuffed with chorizo-and-potato goodness would be.  The best part is the fresh, green dipping sauce that adds a tartness that compliments the cornmeal beautifully.  I've tried both the cochinita pibil  and the chicken in mole verde tacos and found them both to be delicious, but not necessarily exceptional (the taco bar is pretty high).  I had better luck with the baja style shrimp tacos which were fresh beyond my expectations and extremely generous in size.\\n\\nPortion size and perceived value is where most of the complaints have come and I can absolutely understand why.  This is NOT a cheap place to eat, and it's not a place to stuff your face.  I think most people would be perfectly happy to pay the asking prices for these items if they were served on a plate indoors.  The presentation is lovely, the food is terrific, but there's a nagging feeling that you should be getting more for your money from a trailer eatery.\\n\\nI suggest you give El Naranjo a shot and try not to think of it as trailer food."},{"name":"Two Bucks","address":"195 Chittenden Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I went to Two Bucks thinking \\"wow a place where everything is only two bucks, awesome!\\" WRONG.

The Oak Square area needs more places like this; there's such a high turnover of businesses in the area.  It feels like 'grand opening'....'grand closing' at a lot of these places.  Makes what is otherwise a nice neighborhood feel transient.  \\n\\nTwelve Hours is a nice place to bring friends or family.  The seating is comfortable, and it has a nice friendly atmosphere.  You order at the counter from the menu, and they bring the food to you. No need to tip.  \\n\\nThe staff is super-friendly, probably the friendliest I've run into, it makes wanting to patronize the place easy.  One of the proprietors toddlers is around sometimes and she's absolutely adorable.  The food is REALLY good, I've tried a good portion of the menu and everything is at the very least above average, most of it is great.  I haven't had something there that's below average.  The portions are huge; I have a well-established gluttonous American stomach, and I still can barely finish my meals.  If you're a normal human being you're probably going to end up taking a portion home.  Not only that, but the prices are dirt cheap.  They've been doing this 10 dollar special since they open and they keep extending it.  They could charge 20 and it would still be a good deal.  You get a main dish, two appetizers, and a drink, all for like 10 or 11 bucks.  Again, with huge portions they could charge 20 and it would still be reasonable.  \\n\\nPlease go here so we don't end up with a 15th Oak Square area nail salon in its place."},{"name":"Abby Lane","address":"255 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is just a review about the drinks at the upper bar.

The food was very good as was the service, despite the fact they were quite busy. The prices are a little on the high side. There is one thing they do that I really don't like: they print on the bottom of the receipt a \\"suggested gratuity\\". In this case, their suggested gratuities are 18% - 20% - 22%. Most restaurants that do this start at 15%, which is by far and away the most common gratuity most Americans leave for \\"regular, usual service\\" (according to neutral websites that publish these statistics). Starting at 18% is an attempt to intimidate their patrons; for all intents and purposes they're telling them that if they don't plan to leave a minimum of 18%, they are not welcome at this restaurant. I realize this dining establishment is in the tourist corridor, and a lot of Europeans and other foreigners may not be familiar with American tipping customs, so I understand leaving a gratuity reminder on the bottom of the receipt. The part I have a problem with is that it starts at 18%.  The restaurant industry in general is trying to make a 20% tip the \\"new normal\\". This server was waiting on 10 people: our table of 6 and two other couples. I left her $ 6 (which was 15% pre-tax).

The Chestnut Hill location, as far as I can tell, lists one normal Kobe beef burger on the regular menu (and costs $18), and three of the most popular \\"mini\\" burgers on the bar menu, which is where you'll find the $5 offerings on Monday nights only. Now they aren't called \\"mini\\" burgers, merely they are 5 ounce beef burgers, but a normal burger in the main dining area is 10 ounces. 5 ounces, for all you math majors out there is more than a quarter pound, and we've had plenty of smallish burgers that were filling (Flat Patties for one) but these were anything but. French fries? A la carte, and $8, same for the onion strings. A great deal? Hardly.\\n   I like the concept of global-inspired burgers, but what does Swiss cheese, onions, and mushrooms have to do with Manhattan? I'm a big proponent of simply prepared food executed well. And, if anything else, The Met executes, the burgers are tasty, and (mostly) cooked to order. It's not easy cooking such a small burger to the proper temperature, but overall they do it right. The fries, both regular and sweet potato, are delicious and crispy and come with amazing mayo-based dips, one flavored with truffle and Parmesan, the other with horseradish, who needs ketchup? Anyone who has attempted to make crispy sweet potato fries knows how difficult a task that can be, but hats off to The Met for pulling it off. The onion strings are also delicious, but impossible to pick up and even harder to dip in any condiment. My one complaint is the size of the fries, which are more like the ends of a normal french fry, barely the size of my pinkie, maybe you have to eat in the main dining area to get the full size.\\n   The burgers are tasty, but a bit under-seasoned, and totally dry. How can a burger be cooked a beautiful medium-rare, but still remain dry? The mushrooms and onions get totally lost, although the cheese and buns are a nice fit. As decent as everything is, I can't help but wonder what the regular burgers taste like. Are they the same but bigger? Do you get bigger fries in the main dining area? Is the service better? For $5 you get a smallish but relatively tasty burger, but it'll cost you more if you want fries, which places the price around $12 per person, which is no deal. Maybe not a bad option to meet friends after work, sample a few burgers, have a cocktail, but if you're looking for a superb burger option, keep looking."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered a salad, onion rings, and fries. My salad wasn't as fresh as I had hoped. Pieces of the lettuce were browning. The onion rings were basically overly done batter and a thin sliver of onion. Their fries were amazing but the real winner here was the ranch. My fries were just used for me to spoon the ranch. The salad was just a vessel to transfer the ranch to my mouth. The onion rings, while there was no way to make those burnt things better, it was only there for me to eat more ranch. Zesty, chunky yet still light.

The location, just off of Hanover is great.  It's easy to find and get to but you're not overwhelmed by Hanover the minute you walk outside.  \\n\\nI like that the exterior provides no clue as to what's inside.  The decor is just over-the-top enough to be rather charming.  I would typically look at something this \\"done\\" and hate it but they seem to keep the lighting at just the right level so as to not seem tacky.  Upstairs the columns, cherubs, and sconces provide a certain old world charm and downstairs the vineyard/wine cellar provides a romantic space to enjoy a meal and possibly a nice bottle of wine with a date.  The fairy lights, vines, and grapes somehow open the space up and help avoid any possible claustrophobic moments.  \\n\\nService is always friendly and to the point.  I like when the server checks on you enough that you want for nothing but isn't up in your face the whole time.

I'm sorry that we did.\\n\\nBefore we even walked into the restaurant,  I knew we would be in for an experience, and not a good one. Parking is a trip. One would think that the parking lot right next door to the restaurant would be for its patrons, but no, not at Gladys'. The lot closest to the front door costs $7+ to park in, which many pay for because there are NO signs stating that the restaurant has other free parking options. My friend and I were told by one of the neighborhood folks that the free parking lot was directly behind the restaurant. Before we left the front paying lot, the parking lot attendant let us go to the restaurant to put our name on the list before having to move our cars (and without having to pay.)\\n\\nNow onto the list, or rather the lineup. If you've never been to Gladys', you've surely seen the mass of people, as you drive down Peachtree. Basically, you go into the restaurant to add your name to a waiting list, then the \\"hostess\\" gives you a torn piece of paper with a phone number (so you can call to check on your table status, should you decide to leave), gives you a wait time estimate,  and tell you to go wait outside (because there is no space to wait inside, lest you block the take-out counter.) My friend and I were quoted 45 minutes to an hour. In our wait time, we drove our cars around the corner to the free parking lot, which is not marked and has no indication that this is indeed the parking lot for Gladys' restaurant....that is until you see servers out by the dumpster taking their smoke breaks. We also had time to drive to Publix shopping center to go to an ATM because, as other Yelpers have stated more than 20 days ago, they are cash only. There is a sign on the front door saying that their credit card processing is down and they have an ATM in the back of the restaurant for a $3 fee, but if you show your receipt to your server, you will receive a free beverage. \\n\\nAfter running our errands, we go back into to the restaurant and are told that we are next to be seated. Apparently, the hostess had some choice words for a patron before us and there was some tension and raised voices as we were waiting for our name to be called. This should have been our cue to exit stage left, but we stayed. The hostess, still riled up from the words exchanged from the gentleman who had just left the restaurant, rudely told my friend that she needed to go outside to wait for her table. The manager grabbed us before we went back outside and told us that there were two spots available on one of the waiting benches by the window. We sat for less than 5 minutes and our table was ready. \\n\\nWe are seated at a high top at the back of the restaurant, by the kitchen. My friend went to use the restroom and while I was sitting at the table waiting on our server, I noticed that the table beside ours was having some issues. A customer was unhappy with the taste of her food, so she asked for the manager so that she could send her food back. The manager came to the table and told her that she could not send her food back because \\"everyone always sends their food back when they see other customers' plates.\\" O_o Umm...that should've been cue #2 for us to exit stage right, but again we stayed.\\n\\nOur server came over to our table with an attitude like she clearly was uninterested in her job. She took our order and, while my friend was still looking at her menu, closed the menu and took it from her. Cue #3. Our food arrived separately, even though we ordered the same exact entrees. The food was eh...it was okay.  Definitely not what either of us remembered. The food tasted like there was no soul left in it, which is sad because this is supposed to be soul food. Honestly, I've had better waffles at Waffle House. The chicken was ok, definitely not anything special and my yams tasted like they came from a can. My friend and I finished our meals and sat for almost 10 minutes before our plates were cleared, even though at least 7 servers/hosts/manager walked past out table multiple times. Our server came to our table with the bill, after greeting other tables with the menu rundown and waffle specials, which she didn't go over with us. When we pointed this out, she came up with excuses and then gave us a lackluster apology for not giving us the day's specials.\\n\\nNeither my friend or I will ever go back to Gladys'. And, after hearing others complain, I can't help but to wonder how the restaurant is still in business after all of these years. There is better food available in the city and I've had better service at Wendy's or Burger King...and I didn't have to wait an hour to eat.

The ceviche was bright and crisp and hot all at the same time with a depth of savory flavors, brought by the Tigers Milk broth (which we literally spooned out every last bite...), made this one of the highlights of the night. The cilantro rice with our chicken dish was beyond delicious - warm, comforting, bright. And don't forget to finish with a good sipping tequila!\\n\\nCome prepared for flavor in every sense of the word - we could not have had a better meal!

It's polite touches like this which making eating out gratifying. Hanabi offers a nice exotic counterbalance to the more mainstream fare offer by 2525 Anderson Lane's bunk mates SaladWorks and McAlister's Deli. Bento boxes are key lunchtime grub containing numerous courses in one swoop. You could say it's an agreeable sampler platter of Japanese tastes and styles of preparation. \\nThe featured element of my meal was teriyaki chicken. Happy to report it was suitably tender and wasn't overpowered by any sort of slapped together, cloyingly sweet sauce. Just enough sweetness to bolster what could have been bland, tried it before chicken.\\nI don't consider myself a big fan of ginger as a sauce add-in for an entree because it's too sweet and doesn't play up value or flavor. However the salad in my box benefited from its zip. Bounced delightfully off of the cranberries. The almonds were non-descript but because the fresh vitamin-packed carrots and lettuce demonstrated themselves to be affecting taste contrasts that played nicely with the aforementioned ginger and cranberries I didn't mark that down as a negative.\\nAmanda went to ask the chef about the spiciness factor in the spring roll I received. To be honest there wasn't a metric ton of it dumped on the roll so if you're adventurous enough to give it a go by all means proceed. It's got a solid crunch fresh off the stir-fryer. By the way the sauce is one of those sweet and spicy hybrids. Forewarned is forearmed I guess. \\nNice work on the presentation of the California roll. Rice and seaweed wrapped around a healthful medley of avocado, egg, cucumber, and shrimp. The shrimp was optimally flaky. The avocado was silky smooth. I'm a white rice man from far enough way back so getting two helpings (chicken and Cali roll) suited me fine. \\nBe careful downing the clump of ginger in the middle of the box. It's designed to be a palate cleanser. Down too much at one time and your sinuses might reap an unexpected side benefit.\\nDessert consisted of soft, juicy green casaba melon. I was not pleased with the rigid skin one has to negotiate to tear away the softer flesh but it had a gentle dimension of sweetness which proved worth getting to know.\\nOne service quibble was that Amanda didn't see fit to bring a fork to the table in anticipation of my needing it for much of the lunch. She was highly attentive so I'm not going to be ruthless about that slight hiccup.\\nThe interior of the place is bathed in beige. Bamboo paneling along the walls added authenticity. Booth and wrap around seating are available. A fridge contains Bud Light, Shiner Bock, and Coke, to name a few libation possibilities.\\nGood to see Hanabi weighing in as the latest delegate in Anderson Lane's parade of culinary nations. There's potential in the early going."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"One Cnn Ctr, Ste 220","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"After eating at highly rated $$$ restaurants all week, I stopped here for a quick lunch.

And seeing so few people in the restaurant on a busy lunchtime suggests others think the same. Good location for a burger joint and some effort has gone into decorating, but they've made some big errors. Firstly, the service is terribly slow. The place is very much open plan so you can see orders going through to the kitchen, the cooking and then the meals coming to the table. I think the problem is that the procedure the waiters are following is too lengthy rather than any staff being slow. Secondly glazed buns are not a good idea for a burger. They look and taste a bit like cakes as a consequence. The male toilets are a disaster - clean enough but one toilet with a lockable door is ridiculous - men are not used to waiting in an outside corridor to go to the loo. There's clearly enough space to build a bigger men's toilet so use it. Lastly - everyone now agrees that too much salt is bad for you.

It took awhile for our waitress to finally get our drink order. I checked in on Yelp to get the free appetizer and we ordered the garlic edamame and the ramen we wanted. My cousin asked to change the broth of the ramen she wanted to the veggie broth and our waitress explained that it wasn't possible because their ramen is \\"pre-packaged,\\" which didn't sound very appetizing to us. She left to put in our orders and we sat around for a whopping HOUR before finally getting our edamame, during which we received an apology from our waitress and also had the pleasure of seeing her get angry at another waiter for trying to bring food to one of her tables. We finally got our ramen after another 30 minutes (totaling 1 hour and 30 minutes to get our ramen) aaaand mine was the only one out of the 3 that wasn't steaming hot. I dipped my spoon into the bowl and had a taste of the broth and it was lukewarm at best. At that point, after having waited an hour and 30 minutes, I just wanted to eat so I didn't make a fuss about it. The ramen was pretty good, but not the best. As we were eating, our waitress walked by our table with her backpack on and yelled a quick \\"bye!\\" before running out the door. Another waitress came by and once again apologized for the long wait that we had experienced. When she brought out the bill, she pointed out that we were given 20% off for having to deal with the long wait, which we were grateful for.

I was born in Toronto and my parents are from Hong Kong. I've grown up surrounded by authentic Chinese food. While living in Rochester, NY I would travel to Toronto frequently to satisfy my Chinese food cravings.\\n\\nHowever, now that i'm living in Columbus, Toronto is too far of a drive and authentic Chinese food is not as easily accessible. Time to look for viable Chinese food options in the Midwest. Challenge accepted!\\n\\nMy friend XD recommended checking out Helen Asian Kitchen and it turned out to be a great recommendation. She helped to order in Mandarin during my initial visit. She ordered twice cooked pork, fish-fragrant eggplant and salted duck. \\n\\nI enjoyed all the dishes. The soft and sweet eggplant contrasted nicely with the spicy pork and crunchy celery. The flavors were authentic, well-balanced and subtle as opposed to the overly \\"sweet and sour\\" dishes you commonly find at other \\"Chinese\\" restaurants. \\n\\nThe salted duck was the most interesting dish out of the three. It is served cold, so that may automatically dissuade the average American palate. It's also not recommended for people who dislike non-fried duck skin, which has a gelatinous quality to it. But for the adventurous, this dish is a great pick. The salt brings out the natural duck flavor.\\n\\nI visited again soon after and ordered the pork dumplings and the fish fragrant pork shreds (Yu Xiang Zhu Rou Si). Again, I enjoyed both dishes and the portions were huge. I ended up eating the leftovers  for dinner later that day. \\n\\nAn order dumplings came with 14 pieces. They came out with a great soft homemade wrapping. I'm spoiled by one particular dumpling shop in Toronto, so the dumplings were just okay. I thought the pork stuffing could have used a bit more herbs or spices. \\n\\nThe fish fragrant pork shred dish was amazing. It's a little bit on the oily side, but that's how it's served traditionally. It's a Sichuan dish that's served with shredded pork, fungus (mushroom) and bamboo shoots mixed in with some red chili and vinegar sauce. This dish has sweet and sour components, but well-balanced and not overpoweringly so. \\n  \\nHelen and her husband (I think?) are super friendly. They are proud of their dishes as they should be. Their food has been consistently good both times I have visited. They might be a little pricier than the average Chinese restaurant, but I'm happy to pay a small premium in exchange for quality food.

If adding those two people the wait time would go down dramatically. I get the need to create an image that compares to Franklin's. But realistically if it came down to it, I would go back to Franklin's over La Barbeque just because once the store opens, the line actually moves.

From what I've seen, they're like The Naam down the street - but more super-food conscious and purposefully healthy.  A lentil soup of theirs I had once needed seasoning, but that's the sort of place this is. It didn't need salt. I just wanted it to be more salty. There's a salt shaker at the front of this 20 seat micro-eatery, next to a water pitcher you can pour your-own-damned-self (using plastic cups one might find in a kindergarten/nursery environment). This is one of those places where you go for healthy food. There's no service. You order at a counter, enjoy, and leave. I imagine most of their food is recommendable.\\n\\nTheir smoothie selection is great. They have fresh juices like you'd find at Gorilla Food or Nuba - beet, carrot, celery, wheat grass (if you're into that), what have ye. Their smoothies have intelligent combinations that speak of some health-conscious architect's touch. I go there sometimes if I've forgotten to eat, or if I feel like I need a cleanse, but don't really want to commit to the whole cleanse thing.\\n\\nSejuiced gets 4 stars because of the quality of the food - in sheer nutritional terms.

I would highly suggest getting there early. I arrived by 1 o'clock on a Saturday and some items were already sold out. As I waited in line, even more and more items were selling out. It honestly made me quite nervous so get there early to avoid this anxiety. While we were waiting in line, they passed around free samples which was honestly a great idea because 1. it controlled then hanger 2. it gave you an idea of what to order 3. if the item was sold out by the time you ordered you at least got to try it. I and some new friends I made in line (1.5 hours ppl) ordered pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket, cole slaw, pickles, potato salad, and bread. Everything except maybe the cole slaw was exceptional. The brisket was the absolute best. If I am honest, I was there for the ribs but the brisket ended up being the star of the show. I seriously considered buying the frozen brisket and lugging it with me all the way back to Florida. The potato salad was also very interesting.

Well it turns out that Chipotle has a policy of providing free food to touring bands AND they have vegan options.  I don't know how appealing it will be to eat Chipotle 3 meals a day but at least Kevin A. will have something to eat and I won't have to worry about my poor vegan little brother starving to death.  Basically, all they have to do is find the nearest Chipotle in whatever city they're in and they will be taken care of.     \\n\\nThis kind of bold and open support for the arts and alternative lifestyles is refreshing and almost inspiring.

All along Hanover street, one can find egregious, hour-long line ups for meals of varying quality. By offering reservations and a refreshing, thoughtful, and well-executed menu, Carmelinas takes all the guess-work out of this otherwise daunting process.\\n\\nI was part of a large party, and we didn't want to have to wait to be seated in many of the surrounding north end restaurants that dont accept reservations. I made a reservation two weeks in advance since it was for a Saturday night. Though there was a slight hiccup, Carmelinas was incredibly accomodating and prompt in honouring our reservation, saving us so much time and making the experience all the more enjoyable.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, we were really impressed by the variety and ingenuity of the menu. It offered the classic putanescas and carbonaras, but it also featured interesting updates to classic dishes, such as crazy Alfredo and Sunday macaroni.\\n\\nBetween all of us at the table, we ordered quite a variety of the menu options, and the food was incredible, almost across the board. The pasta was all cooked perfect al Dante, the sauces beautifully seasoned, the chicken and meats expertly prepared. The meatballs were the best I had ever tasted.\\n\\nThere was only one issue with the meal. The Sunday macaroni usually comes with meatballs, Italian sausage, and braised rib. However, when it came time to order we were told by the waiter that they had run out of the rib meat. This was annoying, given that it was only 6 pm and we had heard that the rib was the best part. Disappointed though not deterred, we went ahead with the Sunday macaroni sans rib. However near the end of our meal, we saw Sunday macaronis coming out with the full rib. We asked one of the waiters why this was the case, and she promptly asked one of the chefs. We weren't angry, but we were a little annoyed that we missed out on the rib and for no apparent reason.\\n\\nWhat happened next is what really elevated this restaurant from an average first-time experience to a really exceptional first-time experience in our minds. The chef personally came out from the kitchen and explained that earlier in the night they had run out of the rib and that they had then gone out to buy more. He apologized for the miscommunication, and gave us a couple complementary, freshly cooked ribs. This was so much more than we ever could have expected, especially over such a trivial matter as a braised beef rib! But at carmelinas, my impression is that they really do care about making the experience truly memorable.

I usually stop by once every week or so. I like that they keep it simple. Marinated grilled chicken kebab, fresh veggies, rice pilaf, and pita bread.

I don't know what's in their dressing, but I'm glad they started putting it in bigger containers because that stuff is addicting. \\n\\nI usually get either the sub or the dinner. The dinner includes rice pilaf, chicken kebab, whatever veggies you want, and pita bread and dressing on the side. They keep everything separate and make each order individually, so you can ask for no onions or no hot peppers if you're picky. I get it with everything, and they'll ask if you want hot sauce drizzled over the rice, which hells yeah I do! Then I smother the whole thing in that tasty dressing. Best bang for your buck in the Copley area when it comes to quick lunch spots, and even when there's a line it goes by much faster than most of the food trucks and takeout places. They're out there all year too unless it's stormy or too cold out.  \\n\\nIt's cash only, so keep that in mind, but there's plenty of ATMs along Boylston St. They have another location near Downtown Crossing that's been around for years, and one of my co-workers used to venture over there for lunch all the time, so when they opened up another cart at Copley a few years ago I was pumped to try it out because it always smelled so good.

All of the other stuff were not so good, mostly dry and overcooked (including the steamed vegetable) probably because ppl were there eating the grilled meat.\\n\\nThe service:\\nOur server was very  nice, but the guys who kept coming around needed to smile more.

I ordered Genmaicha(Brown rice tea on their menu), Inarizushi, and Miso Ramen.\\n\\nFirst off, the Good: The inarizushi was the best that I've had in the Portland metro area. The tofu was tasty and didn't seem like it had been sitting around for a long time, and it wasn't overly sweet. The ramen noodles were perfect.  They tasted just like the ones i had in japan, and they were cooked just right. The Genmaicha, while not as good as made at home, was pretty good and didn't seem like it was overcooked. They left the leaves in the pot, which i didn't realize right away so i let the tea get too strong.\\n\\nThe Bad: They don't list what toppings come with their ramen or really anything for that matter. I am a pescatarian who doesn't eat any dairy for health and taste reasons. When they brought my ramen it had an egg, which is not all that surprising, and bacon, which i never expected. This gave the broth a slightly eggy and bacony taste which i am not all that fond of. Now it was my fault that i didn't ask what toppings came with the ramen so i just pulled the eggs and bacon out and set them aside, but it did make me wonder why they don't just have the ingredients listed. The other major thing is that the inarizushi was overpriced, but it was really good.\\n\\nThe Bad for now: This is more of i expect this to get better. The service was okay. One of the waitresses didn't speak English very well and also just didn't seem used to customer service. It seemed there was a bit of miscommunication going on. The ramen said it came with just a salad but the waitress brought me Miso soup as well, which was fine but it did make me worry whether they mistook my order of miso ramen for miso soup.\\n\\nOverall, It was pretty good. Remember to ask what toppings come with your food in case you don't like something. The service i expect to get better. They only just opened up sometime within the last week or so so it is too be expected that there is a few kinks. If within a few months time, the service hasn't improved I will leave a review again, but I think they will get better."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"6210 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"If you check out some of my other reviews you know that I love Chipotle.  It is one of my fast food addictions.  I am absolutely nuts about their hot salsa.  There is something truly glorious about the mixture of the hot salsa and sour cream.  It just goes together so beautifully.  \\nUnfortunately, this is the worst Chipotle around.  It is also sadly the closest one to my house by a long shot.  \\nFirst, this Chipotle is crowded and inefficient.  The line will be out the door and you will barely move. The other day when I was here I was the next one at the register and there was a total of 4 minutes between when they rang me up and the person before me.  Why?  There was no need for the person at the register to disappear and no one to replace him for 4 minutes.  This of course led to a back up further increasing their inefficiency.  \\nThe service is also subpar.  I ordered my burrito for here and they didn't give me a tray, bowl, basket, or anything.  The cashier literally rolled my burrito across the metal countertop towards me. \\nThe food is not as fresh at this Chipotle.  My tortilla yesterday was stale.  I ripped off the edges.  I couldn't even eat it, it was so hard.  The chicken was cold too.  Also, I am firm believer that if you don't order beans they should give you extra rice.  I watched as the man behind the counter put one spoonful of rice in my burrito and I asked for more since I wasn't getting beans and he told me he would have to charge more.  Then the lady behind me ordered a bowl with beans and received 2 1/2 spoonfuls of rice.  What's up with that?\\nThe cleanliness of this Chipotle leaves something to be desired.  I had to search hard for a clean table and eventually found one tucked in the corner, but there were napkins, tissues, and burrito wrappers on other tables, benches and on the floor.  There were also burrito toppings all over the tables.  \\nLastly, the parking here is atrocious.  It is a very small lot with quite a few businesses.  So although I love Chipotle, this one doesn't really live up to my expectations for the chain."},{"name":"Tacos La Villa","address":"2415 Cobb Pkwy SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4.5","text":"WARNING - NON-MEAT-EATER REVIEWING A TAQUERIA - PROCEED\\n\\nAs one would expect from a taqueria that shares a strip mall location with a carniceria bearing the same name, the choices were heavy heavy on the meat.

I got a fillingless burrito and my wife got a torta likewise. Credit must be given to the se√±ora at the counter, who docked a dollar off of our orders as a result - an unexpected surprise.\\n\\nAs it turned out, the burrito is clearly little without the carne - flour tortilla wrapping rice predominantly, with some sour cream, lettuce, and slight beans.

First of all it was a week night around 9pm and by no means was the restaurant busy, there were more servers standing around than actually working. My meal took almost 50 MINUTES to arrive at my table and when it did...the steak was well done, I immediately told the server (who was wonderful by the way) that I asked for rare and that the steak was overcooked.  She took it back to the kitchen and I told my wife to go ahead and eat her meal...not exactly sure how long it took to get another steak but my wife was about half through her meal (and she's a particularly slow eater) when I did....well done. Being someone who really doesn't like to complain it pained me to have to tell the server once again the steak was WAY overcooked. She took it back to the kitchen again. My wife had finished her dinner by the time I received another steak and it was cold and the shrimp and parmesian topping looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day and tasted horrible.\\n\\nAt no point did I asked to be comped or said I would not pay for our meal but asked if I could please see a manager. This fellow named Jay came to the table, asked what the problem was with a 'can you hurry up and leave' tone to his voice. I told him that after 3 steaks I would not have ate a single one and that I understand issues arise and mistakes happen, just being polite and purely with the intent of bringing it to his attention. He immediately scoffed and said \\"well the difference between a rare steak and a well done steak is someone's opinion and it sounds like your opinion is that no matter what we gave you it wasn't going to be good enough\\"  he followed that by saying that they are closing and it was time for us to leave. \\n\\nTo be absolutely honest I was fuming on the inside but chose to bite my tongue, pay my $65 tab (for a dinner I didn't eat) leaving a $10 tip for my server (since she was wonderful and I felt bad she had to go through this) and went home. I have been fuming for weeks and now I just have to say, the manager at this particular Applebee's  (Jay) is the absolute least professional, unbelievable excuse for a restaurant manager I have EVER come across.  \\n\\nI will NEVER return to this Applebee's again!!!"},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Warm and friendly atmosphere.

In fact, I'm more apt to write a negative review than a positive one, but I have to say Thai Grille is amazing! The space is not huge, but it's perfect for the atmosphere and location, which is on a side street just off State Street in Uptown Westerville. Nicely decorated with bright colors and original artwork. VERY friendly service. The owner, Ann, apologized that the merlot on the menu that was by the glass was no longer available, then checked back to make sure I liked their new selection (which was excellent!) Now for the food: I have loved Thai since I first had it close to 20 years ago. Since then, I've longed for excellent Thai in Columbus and am THRILLED I have finally found it. My partner and I both had soup. Mine was the tom kha gai (chicken with coconut milk). My initial reaction was that it was a little salty, but after another bite my only thought was \\"perfect.\\" Steaming hot, very fresh and the favors were well blended. For dinner, I had the salmon curry and Dan had pad kee mao (rice noodles, chicken, veggies with chili paste and Thai basil). Both were truly superb! Everything was very fresh - bright, slightly crisp vegetables and again, perfectly blended flavors. I asked for an \\"8\\" on the spicy scale. It was right at medium and could not have been better! Ann apologized that it takes just a little longer to prepare the meals because everything is made fresh. No apology necessary! It was very well worth the wait (which wasn't long.) Ann was delightful and cheery, checking back often to see if everything was OK even after nearly all the tables were full. They have carry out service and suggested that you call ahead on most Friday or Saturday nights. The evening we went was a little \\"slow\\" because it was storming.

However, our experience was terrible. Our server knew nothing about the menu and simply responded to every question with \\"Everything's good. It just depends on your tastes.\\" and \\"Every dish tastes and looks different every night depending on who is cooking...it's really weird.\\" When we ordered a bottle of wine, he had zero clue about the wine list and could offer no input or suggestions. I ordered the vegetarian plate, despite not being a vegetarian, because it's a farm to table restaurant and we are in the height of harvest season...and because a similar dish at Salt was fantastic. The menu said 6-8 veggie dishes, along with assorted cheeses, pickled vegetables and black lentils. When the dish arrived, there were no cheeses, picked veggies, or lentils. There was a very underripe half of a peach that was supposedly grilled but was basically charred on the top and the rest was cold and hard. The presentation of the whole dish was very unsavory with lumps of things all blending into one another. 4 olives, covered by a messy pile of hazelnuts...3 slices of cooked beets, a lump of mushy roasted peppers, a salad of gritty lettuce that was barely dressed, a quinoa salad that was very bland...and by my count, that is barely 6-8 dishes. When I alerted my server to the fact that there were no cheeses, lentils or pickled veggies, he said \\"Give me a minute\\" and came back with a plate with a lump of blue cheese, some crumbs of grana padano, and a soaked pile of giardiniera. Still no black lentils. It was terrible. My husband's dish (gnocchi with duck and cherries) was very good, according to him (I am gluten intolerant so I couldn't taste it). But overall, we left feeling that we would never come back and would never recommend Arugula to anyone. I would love to offer the name of our server, but towards the end of the meal, a woman started serving us with no explanation...our original server was still in sight, but no longer serving us.

I ordered my food, and six minutes later, my food came out. Six minutes makes me nervous... but okay. The carnitas were great, and are slow roasted in house, then served family style with tortillas, rice and beans. The enchiladas were lukewarm.

Abby Lane was right next to our hotel and after a day of business meetings we didn't feel like traveling far for some dinner. We had a super attentive, incredibly friendly server named Skylar who totally should get a raise if his boss reads this.  :-)  He was great!  He suggested great cocktails: I looooooved my 'Shut the Front Door' and my partner loved his 'Mint Condition'.  We also had the French sparking rose with the entrees which was superb and came in it's own cute individual bottle.\\n\\nWe ordered a dozen oysters on half shell because we're landlocked in KY and it was our last night in Boston to get good oysters.  They were amazing!  Huge and delicious, probably the best oysters of the trip.  Then we had clam chowder as a second appetizer because I fell in love with chowda on this trip.  The Abby Lane version of chowder didn't disappoint and I cleaned my bowl.\\n\\nFor entrees I had the catfish and my partner had the tuna.  This is when the bad things began.  My catfish was pretty much gross.  It was way too heavily spiced for that sort of fish and the spice coating was soggy.  The spinach and tomato chutney was okay but it was swimming in too much broth.  Lastly, there were maybe two bbq shrimp and the grits were just...bad.  The texture was way off, and trust me as a KY native with southern relatives, and I know my grits!  So, I took only a couple bites.  I actually saw the lady at the table next to us also sent her catfish back too so maybe Abby Lane should tweak that plate.  My partner devoured his tuna but it was a very deconstructed dish with maybe 6-8 oz of tuna all together so he was still starving afterwards.  We ended up paying our outrageously-pricy bill and going down the block to eat a bunch of sushi rice to fill up our hungry tummies.  \\n\\nSorry Abby Lane.

From the outside spot looks run down and uninviting, sharing a parking lot with a car wash and batting cage. However, I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit. I live a mile away so I had to check Westside pizza out and rep my hood. I have to agree with another Yelper, this spot earned 4 stars because the food was decent, it's not crowded, there is a large patio, and they have a good selection of craft beer. \\n\\nFirst, I'll have to admit I'm jaded when it comes to food. I basically have 3 opinions: it sucked, it was decent, or it was amazing. Decent pizza for me might be mind blowing for someone else so take the comment with a grain of salt. The pizza is thin crust and they have a unique selection so you won't be stuck ordering pepperoni, cheese, or Hawaiian. I had a spicy Cajun pizza with andouille sausage. The pizza sizes start at 10\\" if you come after 5, before then you can do slices. \\n\\nI don't know about you but sometimes I do not want to fight the Friday and Saturday evening lines that are commonplace at any decent restaurant in town. If you are looking for a no wait spot with a full bar and decent food then keep this in your rotation. It is not quite a dive but it borders on the edge. Also, I felt like the servers like you if you are ordering drinks constantly but want you to gtfo as soon as you're done and it's thinly hidden. \\n\\nThe patio is nice if you have a dog. It is large and they are dog tolerant. Outdoor seating is much larger than indoors and partially covered. I would suggest not sitting by the road if you plan on having a conversation because there is a lot of traffic and it can be noisy.\\n\\nLastly, I was most surprised by their selection of craft beer. From Terrapin to Orpheus to Wicked Weed. They have a great selection of draft and bottle which enforces that this a great spot to go when you don't want to fight lines and spend a bunch of money or just want to chill with your dog on a patio with a good beer."},{"name":"Luya Chinese","address":"4498 N Alafaya Trl, Suite 276","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"If you want a decent Chinese place for the price and on a college budget then this is the place for you!

The music playlist was freakin gangsta and the customer service was excellent!\\n\\nThe meats were served by the pound so we ordered 1lb of brisket, 1 lb of pork ribs, 2 sausage links, potato salad, and bread! They let you taste the brisket in case you had any doubts about ordering it! Let me just say it melted in my mouth!

Then you look at the lack of authenticity of the food and its poor quality and wish that such a thought had never crossed your mind, ever. I'll admit the warrior statues and horses are impressive, and the chain seems to have an obsession with ostentatious Imperial Chinese displays and design. It's actually to the point, however, that it's overly pretentious, and it seems as though PFC is trying a wee bit too hard to tackle the impression that you're inside a real Chinese restaurant (as opposed to an Americanized Chinese restaurant.)\\n\\nPortions are certainly decent but not to the point where you'll be exploding, say, if you were to attempt to clean off your plate.

I had the Frutti Di Mare with linguini and fra diavolo sauce and it was on the bland side with far too much olive oil used.  The linguini was a bit overcooked as well, though the mussels and clams were pretty good.  To make a quick comparison, Buca di Beppo does a considerably better job with the dish with better consistency in the pasta and especially the flavor of the sauce.  You'd think a restaurant with so many 4 and 5 star ratings would be able to outdo or at least match up to a national franchise...\\n\\nAs for the service, our waitress did a thoroughly unimpressive job with serving our party.  Not at all friendly or approachable and she seemed like she could've cared less.  She never got around to coming back to take my friend's order for his wine and there was close to a 15-20 min lag between serving the entrees between each half of our party.  The only thing that was up to par was the busboys' timeliness with refilling the water. *face palm*\\n\\nIn the end, the only good thing about the place was the Provenance Sauvignon Blanc I had with my meal - vibrant with great citrus notes.

Who'd a thunk that 3 years after having my first raw experience I'd be living in the capitol of the best BBQ in the world. Yea Kansas suck it up!\\n\\nSo it stands to reason that I'd try just about every BBQ joint in the Hill Country right? Franklin's is excellent yet overrated. La Barbecue is excellent and underrated. It's the #1 for me. The beef rib is smooth, divinely falling off the bone and succulent. The pork ribs have a delicate  caramalized glaze that works well with their homemade spicy sauce. The brisket is my favorite. I love the way the marbled middle piece of fat melts together with a piece of juicy yet not fatty slice. \\n\\nI can't get enough of the spicy slaw, very unique although sometimes you may get a bit too much chili pepper. The potato salad has a southern twist. Most people in Texas do not use celery in their potato salad. La Barbecue adds celery for just that little crunch, dill weed, boiled eggs, peppercorns and are light handed on the salt. Not sweet at all which I can't stand.\\n\\nI'm not a fan of the sausage but that's not due to La Barbecue. I just don't like them made in a pit.

It's probably because Kim's is located in the Golden Garden restaurant and it isn't obvious that they sell sub's there. You actually order them from Garden's cashier and they go to the back and make it for you. There is no signs that they serve sub's when you walk into the restaurant either. \\n\\nBut believe me this place is worth the confusion to locate! After having eaten my fair share of bahn mis in Toronto, when I tried Kim's I was blown away. Why? Well let's start with their made-in-house pate - it is perfectly seasoned and Kim provides such a generous portion of it in her assorted meat subs too. Another reason are the onions she puts in the subs. I've never had onions in my banh mi before but it completely works. Kim uses cooked onions so they are soft and melts in your mouth, and they add a bit of extra sweetness to the sandwich. And finally Kim toasts her sandwiches - this is very rare!  The toasting heats up the pate and warms up the butter making the flavors really pop. This is a final touch that elevates this sandwich to my favorite banh mi ever! Oh and the baguette is perfectly crunchy with the right amount of chew that stays crunchy even after taking it on my flight back home 4.5 hours later. \\n\\nI always come here when I visit Vancouver, and miss Kim's banh mis whenever I eat banh mi in Toronto.

After ordering our drinks (priorities people!!) I decided to peruse the Food menu...except there was no food.  Just as I was about to mention my findings to my friend our waitress with a thick Scandinavian accent attempts to inform us of The Rules.  Yep this place has Rules.  However I missed all of them and sat there, smiled and nodded my head cuz I had no idea what she was saying.  It didn't help that the accordion was making some god awful noise (had not received my drink yet!). Ms. Scandinavia handed us a coaster- 1 side green 1 side red.  My friend and apparently interpreter gathered we were supposed to turn it to the red side for our bill and that there was a buffet to help ourselves.\\n\\nThe buffet was good!  There was approximately 8-10 dishes with only one of them labeled in a sloppy hand written sign \\"Corned Beef\\" the rest you had to guess at.  And boy did I guess right.  Amongst other things I grabbed some Boar- SCORE! I loved it- tender and great gravy!\\nOnce we returned to our table the gentlemen servers brought around all sorts of meat on skewers.\\n\\nThe meat was tender and delicious all except this one gem of a meat.

We see the coronary arteries and probably the supra vena cava.  GET the EFF outta here!  My friend was daring and appropriately stated it tasted like an organ.  Nuts.  Just nuts- 20 hearts all pierced with a wooden skewer...Barf.\\n\\nAnywho.  So at some point my plate was filled with a selection of animal protein- chicken, boar, lamb, pork loin, sausage, steak yet the waiters kept coming to the table.  We couldn't figure out why.

So I venture into the small yet popular little shop and instantly greeted by a kind gentleman who explained the menu to me.  I got the Pepita Avocado Smash with a Focus shake.

It was so simple yet very satisfying with combination of fresh avocado with a little oil and the crisp, toasted pepita seeds.

And the Focus shake had a nice ratio of spinach to the sweet mango and orange, I felt very refreshed and happy after this meal.\\n\\nI had the Potassium juice as a midday snack later in the day and it kept in my  messenger bag for the next 4 hours quite well without refrigeration.

And that sandwich, my first impression was frustration as the dressing cup for the accompanying salad opened up and leaked through the plastic outer container all over the bottom of my full messenger bag.  But aside that annoyance, the sandwich was very delicious, I never had jackfruit before and I kept thinking, where is this supposed accompanying citrus flavor?  Little did I know that the unripe fruit has the mellow shredded pork like consistency usually in a Bahn Mi so it was a super awesome, undetectable vegetarian substitution.  I definitely would get this sandwich again, but either wrap an outer covering over the box to prevent leaks or offer a separate bag.\\n\\nNice to know a place like this exists in Boston now with a friendly, non-pretentious environment.

The place sounded interesting, so we thought we'd try it out. I must say I left with some mixed feelings. \\n\\nThe Pros: The restaurant itself is very nicely done and is comfortable and inviting while still having an air of class. And overall, the food was good. The griddlecakes and huevos rancheros were quite good, as were the cider donuts we got as an appetizer.\\n\\nThe Mids: The Met Muffin (basically Eggs Benedict but with fried eggs instead of poached) was good, but it had only small splash of hollandaise sauce when it really could have used more. Also, I think the runny yolk of poached eggs would have been a better touch. However the country ham and Comte cheese helped offset these shortcomings.\\n\\nThe Cons: First, the prices. They were a bit on the high side for food that, while good, wasn't extraordinary. The cider donuts for example, while tasty, were $9 for three very small (~2\\") donuts. Second, the service. It went from annoyingly persistent (e.g. Almost obsessive coffee refills. I'd barely get through a 1/4 cup and they're refilling) to nearly absent once the main meals came. Third, the homefries. These were not homefries. They were soft, bordering on squishy, seasoned potatoes. Absolutely no hint of crispiness. They were more concerned with presenting them in a perfectly formed cylinder than preparing them properly. And lastly, the Eggs Benedict. This is my breakfast/brunch place benchmark. Eggs Benedict does not contain spinach. That would be closer to Eggs Florentine (their version has pancetta under the spinach). This came as a surprise to those of our party that ordered Eggs Benedict. Fortunately I caught it on the menu before ordering and went for the Met Muffin instead, which was at least closer to what Eggs Benedict should be. \\n\\nWhile this place is quite nice and some things were quite good, I was left feeling largely disappointed at the end of the meal. All things considered, I'm not likely to return unless it's convenient to do so. I won't go out of my way though.

My husband works nearby and claimed it was better than anything near our home. So, off we went! The place was packed, which I took as a a good sign. The female hostess (tiny brunette) is an amazing hostess and knows how to handle the list and people waiting with grace, aplomb, and a sense of humor. The young gentleman host, while friendly, should observe her and learn from her. After a good 30-40 minute wait, we were seated. I don't recall my server's name but she was a fantastic server. I have zero negative feedback on the service; they were outstanding. The ambiance definitely has more of a high-end feel compared to my local place. We ordered the satay and the seafood cream cheese wontons for appetizers The satay lacked the seasoning that I'm familiar with and in truth, I found it a tad bland. The seafood wontons though...holy moly....they were phenomenal. I ordered the chicken pad Thai as my entree (again, I'm predictable) and extra peanut sauce. It was just 'good', to me. I also feel like $2.99 for an extra side of peanut sauce is a little steep. I don't think I've ever paid more than $1. My husband got a curry and I tasted it. Again, 'good' but not amazing to me. My daughter got a curry with seafood and fish balls (it was pink due to the paste) and she too, found it just okay. This all being said, I would go back and give them another try because there were other menu items that look quite interesting to me.

I told the delivery guy that he could take the plain cheese pizza back, and we would wait for the toppings we'd ordered. He graciously told us to keep the pizza we hadn't ordered and he'd bring us another that was as ordered.\\n\\nA few minutes later, though, the manager or owner (I'm not sure which) called to tell us that their website malfunction was our problem -- that because their website messed up, we would have to deal with their web folks if our order was messed up.\\n\\nI spent a few minutes trying to convince the man that since he set up his website or chose the company that did, flaws in how it reports orders are really not the customer's fault. No dice -- he wanted us to pay for the cheese pizza we did not order and I told the delivery guy he could take back to the restaurant.\\n\\nIt was only when I suggested that he check his records to see how frequently we ordered from them and that this was our first complaint that he agreed to send our pizza with the toppings we ordered -- though he insisted on an extra charge for it. We were hungry, didn't really like the plain pizza, and coughed up the extra money.\\n\\nWe eventually got the pizza we ordered. The pizza was both cold AND burnt -- much worse than what we had come to expect from them.\\n\\nWe will continue to order from Rustica for now, but will ALWAYS order by phone. If the food remains good with reasonable consistency and the management shows respect for us as customers, I'll post another update.\\n\\nHonestly, I was really insulted to have someone arguing with me about what I ordered -- why would I suggest sending back the pizza we didn't order AND offer to pay for the original order no matter how late it was if I was just trying to make trouble for them?\\n\\nIf I'm going to pay $25 or more for a pizza, I expect management to be polite if someone makes an honest mistake, and I hope these folks learn their lesson.

I think the fact that we made a reservation helped - they were prepared for our group. \\n\\nWhat I liked very much was how accommodating the staff was. Most of us hadn't eaten here before and all seemed to want smallish portions of the same thing (the mixed kabob platter). We talked to our server about this and he had the kitchen make a giant platter of mixed kabobs (including the sides) for our table. They made more than enough for our group and seemed willing to make more if we needed. I was expecting all of this to end up costing way more than the listed menu price, but we ended up spending way less! My advice? Discuss your needs with your server because there is a good chance he/she can help you get the exact meal you're after. \\n\\nThe food was quite yummy. Seriously, the lamb (if you like that kind of stuff - I know it's not exactly for everyone) was so freaking tender (yes, I know - the non-lamb eaters are totally grossed out right now.

The side veggies were a bit disappointing as they were just the standard mix of carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. They were fine but about as exciting as what I typically make at home. \\n\\nThe entertainment got a bit annoying. Early into the evening, the staff turned the music way, way up. However loud you're picturing? Turn it up a notch or seven. I couldn't hear the person sitting next to me. Out came a talented young belly dancer. She was lovely as was her dancing.

Maybe I've only ever had fried options so I was ill-prepared. I don't know. What I do know is I would have been better off at Olive Garden. Or the Pizza Hut Express in Target... Seriously.\\n\\nFirst of all, LOL at the sticky tables because according to my experience and prior reviews, these things have been sticky for years. Apparently same with the service: came in, empty lobby, went to bar area where one server said \\"sit anywhere\\", so I chose a 2-Top. Then the hostess came over and said \\"Oh did you just walk in (like I wasn't supposed to). Sorry I was in the bathroom do you want a menu?\\" .... Yes that sounds delightfully appetizing, thanks ....\\n\\nBest part of the experience was Howard, my server. Best manners I've ever encountered from a server or probably otherwise. He was just a nice guy and I always appreciate politeness, so thanks, Howard!\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food was laughable. My $11 salad was smaller than appetizer size. It was a single layer of lettuce on a plate, with cubed chicken (like the kind in a tub at Subway or something!), lackluster ingredients, and zero appeal. I ate it slowly while reading reviews of this place and it was still gone in 5 minutes and I'm still hungry, but refuse to shell out another penny for that quality of food. Blech.\\n\\nSo, I obviously won't be coming back -- completely based on portions and food quality.\\n\\n** Note: after I finished this review, I went to the bathroom, where one server was on her cellphone texting, clearly hiding from her manager.

The giant fish aquarium is cool for the kids - they can watch the fish work their way from one tank to the other. \\n\\nService here has always been friendly and fast, well timed and if I don't have to wait for another round of drinks, all the better.\\n\\nI've never been here for breakfast, but I've only heard great things. The portions for lunch and dinner here are huge, which isn't my biggest selling point, but lots of food means easy sharing. Bonus: They have a kids menu and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food.\\n\\nSports bar = bar food. Wings, fried foods of various types, big sandwiches, pizzas. Their fried pickles are great, as are their waffle fries. They do have a hummus plate, if you're looking to eat...well, if you're at Marshall's you're not likely to be watching your waistline, but there you go.\\n\\nThere are BBQ options on the menu, and those items are done well overall. I'm a fan of smoked wings anywhere.\\n\\nOverall, Marshall's is a proven keeper in our dining rotation."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"I love Twelve Hours!

Second clue: the girl at the counter started cleaning after we ordered...um, you're open til 9, you don't start sweeping and wiping things down at 7, when you have customers who just ordered! \\n\\nWe were starving but the food was utterly disappointing. First off, the pot pies were so tiny it was almost a joke (except at $9.50 a pop this was no laughing matter). They were served in teeny tiny ramekins, the diameter was smaller than your average drink coaster. The filling was fine except it had warm and cool spots. The crust was too sweet for my tastes. My son's BBQ bowl was warmer and a larger portion than the pot pies, but still not a lot of food for the price. The three of us were still hungry so we split a piece of cake for dessert. While we all enjoyed the cake and thought it was very moist (I don't recall the name but it involved pumpkin, carrot, and zucchini), the icing was way too sweet, and even though there were 3 of us, we couldn't eat all of it.

Now lets discuss the fried shrimp first, this can easily be done wrong by many people, its all in the batter and seasoning. They were all on point. The seasoning on the shrimp had a little kick and the batter fell off after the first bite. AMAZING. Now grits are hard to get right, I like mine made with a little milk and cooked just right. And Gladys did it all. The grits had the butter built in and with cheese cover the top. It was a Southern paradise.  To top off the meal I had this amazing thing called SWEET POTATO CHEESECAKE!!!!

We were in the mood for some steak. The prices are right around what one would expect, $30-50 on average. I went with the Surf & Turf. Great bargain for $47. That comes with a first course of a type of salad or lobster bisque. I chose the Caesar which was a nice size and incorporated nice, buttered bread instead of croutons. For the entree I went with an 8oz medium rare filet. It was perfect. Juicy and perfectly cooked. For dessert I had salted caramel cheesecake which was delicious. Much better than the Flourless Chocolate Cake as that was one of the worst desserts I've ever had. Wasn't sweet at all. Rather a bitter, dark chocolate feel. Normally, I never return what I order but our server noticed I only had one bite and asked my thoughts on it. Our service was exceptional. The reason I gave Black Point three stars is for their sides. We decided to try a few of them and were left very disappointed. Their Wild Mushrooms were very ordinary and lacked flavor. Same goes for the Blue Crab & White Cheddar mashed potatoes and gratin. Very bland. Completely lacking in flavor. It seemed like it was microwaved right out of a plastic bag. Two bites and we left it alone. The \\"jumbo\\" sea scallops were tasty, but far from what they were described in size. $10 for two small scallops, you will feel like you made a poor choice. Parking can be a little tricky as you're downtown, so you're better off just paying $6 for valet.

It was a carryout order.  I received an email via Yelp/Chownow from the restaurant telling me that my order would be ready at 3.02 pm.  I drove 30 minutes(14 miles) from my house to get there.  I arrived at the restaurant at 3:15 pm.  I told the waitress I was there to pick up a carryout order.  The waitress didn't go to the kitchen immediately, totally ignored me, and did not tell the kitchen staff that  I was there to pick up the carryout order for 7 minutes.  Several minutes passed by.  At least 3 different people came to tell that my order would be ready in \\"just a minute\\".  Order still not ready.  I then asked another waitress at the bar to check on food, telling her that I had ordered food over an hour ago and it was supposed to be ready at 3:02 pm and it is now 3:40 pm.  Food still not ready.  Apparently, they didn't even bother to start the order until 10 minutes after I arrived at the restaurant.  The waitress rudely told me that it's not her fault, it's the cooks in the kitchen's fault.  I have eaten at this restaurant many many times in the past, but today the service was awful.    I would not recommend ordering food from this restaurant via Yelp or Chownow.  They seem to have a communication problem.  The service was awful but the food was great. There are many great restaurants in Atlanta. Customer service is the variable that determines which of these restaurants is a standout.  The purpose of getting a carryout order is to have the food prepared before the customer arrives so they don't have to wait!!    In this case, to make matters worse, the restaurant sent me an email telling me when the order would be ready, and when I showed up to pick up the order, they had not even started preparing the order.   They did not start the order until after I got there to pick it up.  It is obvious that from a customer service point of view the people working in the restaurant today could not possibly care less about getting your food to you in a timely fashion.  I felt like they just didn't give a damn.  If you want to be ignored and treated like sh*t while waiting a ridiculous amount of time for a carryout order that should have been ready 50 minutes sooner when the restaurant told you it would ready, then this is definitely the place for you.

However, the ones here are store bought with zero taste, rather than locally made. Worse, they are steamed, rather than cooked a bit on the grill (which would give them a little body/rigidity, although I'm NOT referring to a hard shell experience).

Free valet sealed the deal.\\n\\nIt wasn't until we were seated and looked around that we started to get nervous.  We were the youngest people in the joint by about 3 decades, easily.  And I am no spring chicken.  Whatever, maybe the food will make up for it...\\n\\nMeh.  Everything was meh.  The bf had \\"steak bombs\\" which were essentially cheesesteak materials made into spring rolls with spicy dipping sauces.  He really enjoyed it, I thought it was meh.  He then got a huge burger, which he described as \\"okay, but nothing special.\\"\\n\\nI had the night's special, French onion soup.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  There was waaaaayyyyyyyy too much cheese.  I followed that up with an iceberg lettuce bowl salad.  It was an interesting concept: hollowing out a head of lettuce and serving a salad in it.  But, it was mostly meh.  There was just too much pepper, the bleu cheese was unnecessary and gross, and the frizzled onions were a weird addition.  It's not often you find a bad salad, so that's kind of impressive.  All together there was way too much food, which was also annoying since it's not the kind of food you're excited about taking home to eat again.\\n\\nThe service left a lot to be desired.  It vacillated between hovering and aloof.  It took the waiter about 15 minutes to take our order.  After we'd started eating, he attempted, no less than 3 times, to take my plate away while I was still eating--and I mean actively eating.  The second time I had to actually tell him to give it back.  After he took the food away, it took 5 minutes for him to come back and ask if we wanted dessert (which we didn't), another 5 to get the check, and another 10 to get the change.\\n\\nWhen we walked out, we saw that the bar was packed and with young(er) people seemingly having a good time.  I wish the host had given us the memo, given that we were clearly too young for the dining room.\\n\\nThe chances of my coming back are pretty slim.  Unless I need somewhere to take a grandma or a cougar."},{"name":"Is'Original","address":"1671 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Really really good food. The flavors are fantastic. I ordered take out and I highly likely recommend the Penang curry and Shrimp Pad Thai. The only thing that I found to be a minor inconvenience was that the tails were left on the shrimp: not a big deal but it interrupted the flow of eating the food. Overall great taste."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My teenage daughter & I were at Dell Children's for the day. We were starving after a day of appointments & had no clue where to eat. Yelp did not let us down. We found Contigo off the beaten path & loved it. A totally hip & refreshing choice. As we approached, I fell in love with the cactus & outdoor/semi indoor setup. The menu had lots of great choices. My daughter enjoyed her burger & fries and my baked chicken was delicious. A perfect ending to our meal was a shared dessert of bread pudding. We will definitely be back!"},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"8151 SE Lamphier","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"2","text":"We have often stopped by this McDonald's as it is close to other places we frequent and it has always been professional and nice. \\n\\nBut that was through the drive through. Walking in one day before a trip we ate outside. The place is clean and a little cozy. Outside was clean as well. \\n\\nThis is where the service shined. The location means it is very busty but in spite that we got courteous and friendly service. \\n\\nThis appears to be a franchise and not one of the corporate as the d√©cor was different. \\n\\nExpect fast service, you will get it.

Another group came up wanting to drink and he told them they couldn't just have drinks (some liquor license bs). They said fine, we will order an app...heard him mumble something and they left.

Listed on menu as \\"Classic Tuscan pappardelle pasta with slow cooked Vermont raised rabbit\\" Yeah...I REALLY did not need to know that last bit about the rabbit's upbringing either but, boy, was it good! Cooked to perfection! And only $27!!! \\n\\nLessons learned from previous four outings:\\n1. Always reserve a table on the second floor by the window: amazing view of old and new Boston and awe inspiring sunsets during non-winter months! \\n2. Never come during restaurant week since regular prices are not too high (if you skip dessert and drink water) and restaurant week attracts what New Yorkers call \\"the bridge and tunnel crowd\\" loud, vulgar, and worst of all: poorly dressed.\\n\\n\\nOverall: this place deserves 6 stars!"},{"name":"Busters Towing","address":"435 Industrial Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"1.5","text":"Parked car in downtown. Next thing I realized while walking down the street was a Busters towing truck parked a few meters behind. There was this Caucasian man sitting in there and seemed like he was waiting for someone to be towed. My immediate thought was \\"oh that Busters truck must be camping for an unfortunate driver\\". Turned out I was the unfortunate driver.\\n\\nI went back to add in more money into the meter in the middle of my dinner. When I left, my car vanished, and there was an Asian driving the towing truck instead. So apparently the Caucasian driver I saw before was just sitting there until he saw my car violated the temporary restrictions by like 5 minutes. I couldn't really say anything since it was my fault for not properly knowing about the restrictions.\\n\\nI got to the Busters office. As usual, they ask for your license plate and drivers license. What ticked me off this time was the tow truck driver was probably not educated properly and wrote a wrong address. The old guy who was helping me noticed I gave a \\"wrong\\" address where my car was towed and rudely denied me access several times until he realized it was his mistake. He kept on yelling \\"WHO GAVE YOU THE LICENSE PLATE?\\" even though I was clearly the owner of the car. At the end, I got my car back but it was an extremely unpleasant experience.\\n\\nSide note, check your car thoroughly when  you receive it back because Busters is known to damage customers' cars. I had to pay $800 my first time I got towed by them because they ripped the plastic cover behind my front bumper."},{"name":"Spoon Eastside","address":"749 Moreland Ave SE, Ste C-105","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great service, delicious thai and very nice atmosphere.

Catfish taco, good, with a hearty crunch from the corn batter. The BBQ brisket taco was even BETTER, with the perfect jalapeno coleslaw to go with it. The thai chicken taco was also good, because I LOVE peanut sauce. \\n\\nEven more than the tacos, the fries impressed me the most. Their specialty, peach mint JELLY (they don't call it jelly, but that's what I would call it), is soooo good and goes so well with french fries. Also, their truffle mayo is really good. Get a few sauces and alternate between them and it'll keep your meal interesting and fresh with each bite.\\n\\nLastly, the staff (is that the right word?) is really friendly and are devoted to giving you a good experience.\\n\\nTHIS IS MY 100th REVIEW!"},{"name":"Tucci's Southside Subs","address":"801 E William Cannon Dr, Ste 240","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Gotta say the place needs serious cleaning.

For my sides, I had french fries and BBQ beans.  The french fries were cooked to perfection and the beans were tasty.  For a chain restaurant I was really impressed with the food quality.

I'm not the biggest wine connoisseur or anything, but I appreciated the menu and liked how you could order according to how much you wanted per glass.  The space is small but spacious enough, with a very modern Italian feel.\\n\\nWe shared the risotto balls and eggplant parmesan to start.  The risotto balls were pretty decadent-creamy and fried.  Almost like mozerella sticks.  The grilled egplant parmesan was pretty dissapointing.  I love eggplant but the way it was cooked make it so chewy and unpleasant and there was no parmesan, just mozzeralla.\\n\\nThe entrees made up for that, though.  The cocoa tagliatelle was very strong tasting with the combination of mushrooms, orange zest and cacoa but i loved it.  Better as a small portion than a full meal, though.  The faro fusilli really stood out, though.  I had never had fresh whole grain pasta like this, it was cooked perfectly al dente and lightly seasoned with basil in a tomato broth.  I could've had a whole plate of this myself.\\n\\nFor dessert we shared the ThreeRamisu which was a tiramisu, tiramisu ice cream and tiramisu milkshake.  All was good but nothing outstanding.

It was packed with a fried egg, chorizo, lettuce, onions, pickles, and a guacamole chipotle lime sauce.  \\n\\nI consider myself a burger afficiando and this burger blew my mind. The flavors all blended perfectly together which I did not think would happen since their was so much going on. The patty was thick and juicy and of good quality.
