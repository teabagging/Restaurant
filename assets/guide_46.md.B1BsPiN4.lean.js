Although the restaurant was never to capacity the whole time we were there, we were always discouraged to walk in and wait for a table when calling Lenoir and trying to book a table. Parking is definitely an issue here as it is on a busy location on S 1st. Street and the parking is scarce. My husband dropped us off and came back about fifteen minutes later, sweaty and bitter.  Nevertheless, we had some cocktails while we waited for the patrons at our table to leave. Once seated we realized that leisurely dining is not encouraged at Lenior as evidenced by a note at the bottom of the menu that seating was limited and please be courteous to those waiting for a table. Confirmation of this was when our waitress stopped waiting on us after our last course was served.\\n\\n\\nWe had heard great things about Lenoir from several people and were anxious to try their cuisine. The wine and beer menu is small but full of goodies so we have no complaints there. Additionally, everything at this place is modestly priced, a true bonus here in Austin. Lenior has a three course prix-fixed menu for 35.00. There are three options under each heading and you can order however you like in any quantity from the 12 items on the menu. Meaning, you may have three desserts, or three of the exact same entree if you so desire. It's a true mix and match.\\n\\n\\nOnto the food review...\\n\\n\\nAll four of us in the party ordered from the field division to start. Two of us had the braised artichokes and the other two had the chickpea panisse. Both dishes were exceptional. The artichokes were served with homemade grainy mustard, wateroak feta, and a microgreen and grapefruit salad. It was delicious, light and perfectly prepared. The other two had the chickpea panisse, which is like a flan style prepared chickpea dish served with oyster mushrooms, wilted greens, and a perfectly prepared poached egg. This dish was excellent as well. Both dishes were very unique.\\n\\nFor our second course, three of us ordered the kasu-cured fluke. This was the best dish of the night. It was served crudo, which was not listed on the menu; probably a good thing since we might not have ordered it if it was. None of us had eaten raw fluke before, but the way they prepared it was divine. It was atop an avocado butter, and topped with crab, radishes and wonderful vinaigrette. There was something crunchy on the top that suited the dish well. My husband ordered the buttermilk rabbit, and it was a huge disappointment. It was drowned in what tasted like a Thai curry broth gone bad. The rabbit was in no way tender and unappealing to the eye in color. It is not a good sign when the spring vegetables are the highlight of a \\"land\\" dish.\\n\\n\\nFinally, we moved on to course number three. My amiga and I went with the fish curry and it was very good. The tomatoes in the dish were excellent and the peppery finish in the dish heated up our palates quite well. The fish was a little heavy form the frying; perhaps an oven roast or grill would have been better. The type of fish was not revealed to us, but it was a good dish overall. Our husbands had the crispy goat and potato terrine. This dish was a complete failure. The main problem with it that made the dish completely inedible was that it was too salty to eat. One of the recipients of the dish is a huge salt fan, but neither of them was able to eat the dish. We told our server and she happily substituted the dish for the head-on roasted gulf shrimp which was an average dish at best. The shrimps were well prepared and tasty but the grits had an odd shrimp sauce that made it hard to have more than a few bites. The butchered snap peas were sparse, but what was there was very good. After the twice over disappointing third course we opted not to order off the dream section and give our table up before we sat too long.\\n\\n\\nWith the difficulty in parking, the cramped eating space and the roller coaster of success and failures of the dishes, we doubt we will return to Lenoir.

It being my first time there and my girlfriend's third time, I let her pick the places to go. She had been here a few times and loved it every time.  So as I always do with restaurants I checked out the Yelp reviews and was disappointed with the mediocre reviews. However, I trusted my girlfriend and decided to give it a shot. The \\"experience\\" started when walking up the street lined with Irish pubs. I noticed that every single one had a sign for a lobster special for around 10 bucks ( how could you go wrong!). This got my appetite going for some lobster. We arrive and are immediately seated. Being the oldest restaurant in America I expected it to feel older but all i got was the feeling that the whole place was designed to feel old without actually being old. \\n\\nNow we come to the most important part. The food. Before i get started with the food i should mention that a 2 pound lobster cost 50 bucks!!!. The 1.25 pound was a bargain at 30 bucks. Now at this point I think to myself, how could this lobster be so much better that it would be worth triple the price of the other places. Since i decided my wallet couldn't handle the consequences of that decision i went with a $5.95 cup of clam chowder and the $17.50 seafood pie. My girlfriend and I decided to share the fried calamari. The soup did not have enough clams in it to warrant such a high price. the calamari was the greasiest fried calamari I've ever eaten. The seafood pie was a scoop of mashed potatoes over a soupy mixture of tasteless miniscule shrimp and what appeared to be diced oysters. I think at this point i should have saved some money and gone next door for some $10 lobster. \\n\\nOverall impression: a restaurant that may have been better in the past but now is nothing more than a tourist trap with bad overpriced seafood."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Phenomenal food, though a bit pricey. We came here for a lunch of small plates. Most items on the lunch and basic \\"entradas\\" menu can be served in small, medium, or large (similar in portions to tapas restaurants in Spain: small is a taster, medium could be shared among a few people, and large plus a tapa would be a light meal). The small plates are $10 apiece and so can add up quickly, but everything we had ranged from good to spectacular. \\n\\nA few notes on general themes: they provide three salsas: lightly spicy peanut, passionfruit-chile, & spicy roasted chile. Passionfruit normally seems rather like kiwi: potentially tasty, but usually of poor quality, added for a bland sweetness with a hint of \\"exotic.\\" The addition of a modicum of sharp habanero- or similar chile completely changes this effect, ranging from the dipping salsa to the Peruvian cocktail of habanero vodka with passionfruit puree. Anything in chimichurri is also good; too often chimichurri is low-grade olive oil with a smidgeon of seasoning. Andina's version has strong notes of garlic, parsley, and roasted peppers or paprika. \\n\\nThe causa morada was a tasty timbale of mashed purple potatoes and lightly spiced chicken salad. The asparagus in chimichurri were perfectly grilled. Peppers stuffed with quinoa and cheese delighted, as did the daily special of roasted mild Oregon chiles dusted with Parmesan and salt. The trio of potatoes were less exciting than other dishes, but nice enough. \\n\\nSeveral items on the dessert menu featured manjar blanco, which seems to be the Peruvian version of dulce de leche, a caramelized sweetened milk.

Ok   The food was ok... we had a couple plates of cheese fries of different types and a couple of different sausages.   I would say that it was not quite up to the tasty Bestwurst standard... which is 1/2 the price, by the way.\\n\\nThe drinks were pretty good... but again, there is a bit of sticker shock when one looks at the prices.   I think every drink we had was north of 10 bucks.   Most beers were 5.   Its pretty clear they are passing on the cost of the expensive space to the customer.\\n\\nOverall:  I thought the service was great but that couldnt make up for average food and expensive-4-what-you-get prices.

Very few options and nothing seemed fresh. Let's talk about the meat now. For a place that I'm paying $23 bucks for and is pretty much a buffet, I expect to try at least maybe 7 different types of steaks and cuts. I only had four... Four very dry and overcooked pieces of steaks, a bacon wrapped chicken, and a sausage. For being known as a steakhouse I think they would offer something better than a well done sirloin, a dry tri-tip steak, and a tasteless top sirloin. After all that, I was expecting maybe some dessert or at least a coffee, but that was not included in my $23 dollar meal. At the end of it, when we received our bill, you wouldn't believe it but they charged gratuity on a two person party. Who in the right mind charges tip on a two person party. I know how to tip, so you shouldn't assume I don't know how to. Anyways I will not be going back here.

We got a nice mix that Chris devised for us.  He was also helpful by letting my father know that the lobster and bacon mac and cheese was huge, and to order it as a side.\\n\\nWe all had the spinach and arugula salad.

He got the S'more Brownie and that was the bomb.  OMG, so good.  Mom got the Key Lime pie w/Macadamia Nut Crust.

Last night I picked a friend up from the airport and wanted to welcome her back with a nice drink and maybe desert.  She had never been to the Top and we had dinner nearby, so I figured it was a good time to go back.\\n\\nI've been to the Top of the Hub for dinner only a few times - the food was always good, the wine menu solid, service was hit or miss and prices were outrageous, but it was a great spot for a big date.  Shows you how few 'big dates' I've had.  \\n\\nHowever, I used to love coming to the bar/lounge - they'd have great jazz playing in the corner and you could just waltz in, grab a bar stool or chair, and enjoy the view over a martini.  But some things have changed...\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed this time is that they've remodeled since I was last there - they've now moved the bar seats to the other side of the bar, away from the window, thus blocking the bar patron's view with the back of the bar.  Furthermore, the remodel has split the 'bar/lounge' into two separate entities - a bar and a lounge.  You can still walk in a grab a seat at the bar, which is now limited to one of maybe a dozen stools in a cramped hallway.  You now have to wait to be seated in the lounge, which carries a $24 per person minimum.  In fact, it seems like you can't even get a drink and walk into the lounge - the couple next to us at the bar last night tried this and was asked to return to the bar.\\n\\nSo in essence, the Top of the Hub has gotten cheap on us - the view no longer comes with your bar tab, you have to pay extra.\\n\\nFortunately our bar tab was well over the $24 per person minimum, so we moved from the bar to the lounge as soon as a table was available.  So here are my suggestions for your TOTH experience:\\n\\nThis is the definition of the perfect date restaurant.  It's also a great place to bring friends and family from out of town.  I've been here eight years, and I'm still impressed with the view.\\n\\nTry to sit on the east side of the restaurant - downtown Boston, Cambridge and the river is a much more impressive view.\\n\\nSkip dinner - you can get a better meal for less elsewhere in the city, and still come here for drinks & desert.\\n\\nI'm not a big fan of sweet drinks, but everyone I know who is LOVES their martinis.\\n\\nThe best value item on the lounge menu is the cookie plate.

Well, the decor is cool, it's a lot bigger than it looks on the outside.\\n\\nThe best thing they have to offer is their cornbread. Both myself and my buddy were amazed at how moist it was. No butter needed! We even asked for and received a second piece for free! That's great!\\n\\nBut the rest of the meal was just ok. The steamers were nice, the dipping sauce was nice. The lobster was pretty good but the flavor was just alright. I guess I'm too used to Chinese methods of cooking where a lot of sauce is used to flavor the lobster. This was cooked fine, it was done, it was pretty tender but still had good texture. It just didn't taste like..... anything special. I tried it with the dipping sauces, and I guess it was better.... but adding lemon and butter to ANYTHING makes it better. The clam chowder was better than most places, but not worth the effort to come here.\\n\\nWhat really disappointed was the dessert. The Indian Pudding was like mushed carrot cake. Literally. Nothing great, not gonna make me puke. But just sort of not worth the effort of describing it here.\\n\\nThe final cost for the dinner was $50 + tip, which featured clam chowder (+ an extra cup for me), corn bread, a 1-pound lobster, and probably 15 clams, and the Indian Pudding.

There's just so much to try!\\n\\nWhen we arrived for lunch, the restaurant was about half-full, and we were promptly seated in a corner. Since we were up against a wall, the seating was a bit uncomfortable and I asked if we could be moved, which we graciously were. I think I only have one complaint about Andina, and it's that the tables are very close together--I would prefer more spacing and the feeling of a bit more privacy.\\n\\nMy wife and I love small plates, so we knew upon seeing the menu that we wanted to keep our orders to the $10 plates. We asked our server how many would be appropriate for the two of us, and he suggested 3-5. Naturally, we ordered 5!\\n\\nThese were staggered nicely after the delicious bread came out. I honestly think their bread service should get some recognition for being so unique. Each of the 3 salsas it was served with were delicious and so unique. My favorite was the peanut one, with the salsa verde being a close second.\\n\\nAfter this, our first three small plates were brought out. They were the yucca croquettes, quinoa salad and the causa mixta. The croquettes were utterly phenomenal, with the pureed yucca offering a lightness that differed than the traditional potatoes. The cheese in the middle was just enough without being over the top, and each bite of croquette just seemed to melt away in the mouth. The causa was also quite tasty, especially the fried shrimp atop. One minor issue I had with the causa, however, was that I felt the crab on top was too heavy-handed with the mayonnaise. I would've preferred a cleaner flavor. The ceviche-style tuna was perfect. And to cap the first series of dishes, the quinoa was ultra-light and refreshing. The hint of fresh mint was perfect.\\n\\nRound two came out and brought our final two small plates. First up were the seafood wontons. These were actually the biggest surprise in that the stuffing was pure seafood--no kitschy fillers like cream cheese. Just pure seafood--mostly shellfish. I found them to be wonderfully simple and briny, and the tamarind sauce was delicious. To cap everything off we enjoyed a cheese plate. One cheese was clearly your basic manchego, but I could not identify the other two. The middle cheese was incredibly soft--more so even than a brie, and the third was a blue. They were both a perfect cap to the afternoon.\\n\\nNext time I'm visiting Portland, you can be sure I'll be back at Andina.

Simple enough? \\n\\nThe food came and right away, we notice that the Calamari was a bit pale. We took a few bites and realized it tasted as pale as it looked. Pass. Next, we had some Poutine. How do you really mess up a bowl of french fries with gravy and cheese? You just don't. It wasn't fantastic, but it was edible. Finally, the Bacon-wrapped Oysters... words cannot describe. I put my knife through it and green gunk oozed all over the rock-hard toast supporting the Oysters. I don't know why, but I put the half piece in my mouth and ate it. Worst decision of the day. My friend had finished an entire piece before realizing that she shouldn't have. Right away, the toilet called her name. Our plates and forks were also soiled with rotten oyster juice. Wonderful. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we rejected the dish. Our waitress offered a replacement, to which we accepted. We decided to try the only dessert on the menu: Deep Fried Banana Cheesecake.

It was coated in cinnamon sugar, which made it that much more deceiving. I felt cheated. It might as well have been Deep Fried Banana with cinnamon sugar.

The oldest continually operating restaurant in these United States, it should have the most Yelp reviews of any restaurant.  In an effort to be any different than those who have come before, I shall give the viewpoint of a southern tourist.  Looking for someplace interesting to eat in Boston, someone knew of this.  They were able to accomodate our reservation for 14 with a couple days notice.\\n\\nThe food was terrific.  I had the lobster ravioli, a very tasty dish and highly recommended by the house.  Every meal here comes with corn bread, something well appreciated by the southern palate.  I also had the opportunity to try the clam chowder.  I had 4 bowls of it in 4 different places over the trip, so while I certainly would rate it the best I had in Boston, better check with a local for a full report on whether this is actually tops in town.  The rest of my party had assorted other dishes, with reviews ranging from yay to run of the mill.  But my food was all to the positive, although portion sizes were small for the price.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, the price is the only thing keeping this place from a fifth star.  I suppose if I was there with an older crowd, it would have been fine.  As it was, we had students with us on a very small per diem, and this place blew them out of the water.  My meal was in the low to mid $30 region.  For that price, I expect high quality, and I got mid-to-high quality, for which I would expect about 50% more lobster ravioli than I received.  Lots of the seafood is market price, so no one ordered that and I cannot speak for it.  Still, a little extra money to say I ate in a uniquely Boston place was satisfactory.\\n\\nThe service was top notch.  You can eat downstairs at a bar, and there's multiple levels of restaurants as you go up the stairs.  All of the staff we met were friendly, helpful, and efficient.  They definitely tended towards an older waitstaff, which fit with the spirit of the place.  The giftshop had some neat items to commemorate the visit, and the attendant there was more than willing to take pictures of the group.  I'm not saying, I suppose, that it isn't a tourist trap.

However, when her omelette arrived, no spinach. We waited a while for him to come back so we could send it back but he never came back in the room and we were hungry, so she ate it as is. Of course when the bill came, she had been charged extra for the spinach. We advised him the spinach wasn't in the omelette and asked him to remove it from the bill. A few minutes later, he came back with the spinach removed from the bill, but said the chef insisted that the spinach WAS in the omelette and we just didn't see it. Seriously?!

So I went back for round three...  I had previously in the last few months tried to eat the food here and then at Gustav's at the Airport.  They were kind enough to see my poor review here and send me a gift certificate to give it another go.  I will give them major props for that because they are showing that they do care and want to do better.  I wanted to really give them a great review just because of that and I wish I could, I really do.\\n\\nOn Friday night I gave them another go.  The restaurant itself had a long waiting list so we asked to be seated in their bar which was actually pretty slow for a Friday evening which we were not complaining about until the drunk old people decided to move from the bar to seat their asses a foot from our table.  Of course ALL of the other tables throughout the bar were also open but oh no, they apparently wanted to snuggle.\\n\\nI brought my friend J because she has grown up going to this restaurant and is determined that they have good food and that I am truly delusional.  Her saying four different times that such and such is supposed to come with the meal and used to or \\"wow, this is tiny now I guess\\" were basically giving me the impression that they now are nickle and diming people.  Apparently the Swiss fondue used to be given with the meal - which explains why people would eat it.  Seriously, order a container of Morton's salt because all THREE times I have eaten here all I taste is salt and again I say, it is not good fondue.  The bread was the good part.  I did order their crab and roasted red bell pepper fondue which was much better than the Swiss but seems very overpriced at $12.99 for this dinky little pot.  The grilled bread that comes with that is pretty amazing though.  Their salad was meh with excessively watered down Ranch dressing that had absolutely no flavor.  My friend had a cup of their lentl soup which again was tiny now I guess and it was ok - wished I got the taste of soup instead of the flavorless salad.  Apparently they also used to bring you bread and plum jam which they also no longer do.\\n\\nI decided to go with a rib eye steak.  Ok, so our waitress was a doll - but honestly that only goes so far when you have her working three restaurant sections to where I order a drink and she takes 20 minutes to bring it to me.  I know she is doing the best she can and want to give her the benefit of the doubt - a smile goes a long way also and she was really nice.  We got there and honestly I figured with the bar so cleared out we would be smooth sailing for at event we were attending at 8pm.  I mentioned to her to please bring our deserts to go and also bring the check with our meal because we had something we were going to at 8pm and I apologized for making them rush.  Same thing as when we went to a birthday party there - apparently a premade desert takes over a half an hour to put into a box and my favorite part was our main courses took 40 minutes to come out and my steak was COLD...my potatoes were cold...saving grace that I will give them is the potatoes with mushrooms were very good and the steak was grilled to perfection.  I would have preferred eating a warm meal.  And, to complete our experience, the event we attended sold out because we got there late.\\n\\nI did eat my desert later which was their strawberry pizza.  It was shortbread with glazed strawberries and some whipped cream - not bad but seriously I spent another $30 with tip on top of the $25 gift card they sent me for just my meal...

There were some definite good things about this restaurant and some things I wasn't so sure about. \\n\\nThe good things were that the pizza was AWESOME. I am always on the lookout for a great pizza place and this one has made my list! We tried the Perella and it was fantastic. The crust had a nice flavor and was very crunchy (not soggy NY style). The pizza also had awesome ingredients that seemed super fresh - cherry tomatoes, basil, Parmesan, goat cheese. The pizza came out quick and was perfectly charred (just slightly). The staff was very friendly and we didn't have any major problems.  It was very very good and I will defintiely be going back.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant however was not very interesting at all. The space lacked charm, and lacked decorations. The walls were very plain (are they not done decorating?). It seemed very cold and not like somewhere you'd want to hang out and have pizza and a beer. They did have a nice bar area with local beers and wine - that small area of the restaurant was decorated slightly with exposed brick and beer signs, the rest was just plain. Additionally I think that for the somewhat high cost of their food, you shouldn't have to order at the counter and wait for someone to bring out food. I think that this restaurant would benefit from having servers that take your order at your table. \\n\\nWe will definitely be going back again for the pizza.

I'm not a snob I'm actually quite happy going to many of the conveyor belt places, but this restaurant is the worst I have ever been to. \\n\\nThe restaurant could more aptly be named \\"I Love Paper Thin Sushi and Sugary Small Pieces of American Pie\\" but that name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. I went in the early afternoon just after the noon hour crowd.  The sushi offerings were awful. First, it was actually quite difficult to find a decent piece of sushi. There were as many pieces of pie and cheese cake as there were sushi selections. The sushi itself was served in extremely small and thin portions. When small rolls were offered they were filled with, well, filler, and you really needed to look closely to find the paper thin sushi on top. \\n\\nTo me the worst of the experience was the misleading pricing. The restaurant has signs plastered all over the walls advertising \\"Happy Hour Prices.\\" When I went to check out I expected my bill to be $7.50. Instead it was $11.00. When I asked why the cashier told me that to qualify for the happy hour pricing you had to buy a soft drink with your meal to obtain the happy hour pricing. She made no attempt to reduce the price of my meal when I told her how surprised and dismayed I was. \\n\\nThis place seems intended to extra the maximum dollars from your wallet for the minimum amount of actual sushi and service.

What a disappointment.\\n1 - waiting in line and watching the line cooks was fascinating but exhausting. I've done my share of waiting at NYC restaurants, but at least I could say some were worth it. I'm not sure why they feel their seating system works: You have to stand in line to order food and then hope that when you are done ordering, a table will be open for you. My party of 2 was seated at a 4-person table, not ideal for the next party of 2-4. Then, when you're seated and trying to enjoy your food, you got a whole line of people standing next to you and out the door hawking at you to leave sooner. Also, I made the mistake of paying tip when we paid for the food. It was awkward leaving the table after we were done and not leaving anything there. \\n2 - the food was disappointing. My friend ordered the western omelet and I had the french toast with fruit on top. I wished I had taken the slab of butter off of my french toast earlier, but I was too late. By the time I sat down with my food, my french toast had already become soggy with the melted butter...which has drained itself onto the rest of my plate and allowed my fruit to bathe in it (doesn't look very appetizing). After eating one french toast, I just couldn't get myself to finish the rest because of this slick of oil/butter taste that it had left in my mouth - it tasted so bad. I tried to save it with some syrup, but couldn't. I hate wasting food. Fruit assortment is nice though. And by cooking everything on the same grills, I noticed that my friend's omelet had left a similar oil slick aftertaste too. \\n\\nFood was not worth the 45 min wait for.

Getting your cocktail waitress to come over and take your order was like an act of congress, so I literally had to get up out of my seat to go find someone to put in my order.

Finally, the drinks came and they were wrong! I asked for Titos and tonic with a splash of cranberry and two limes.  When the drink finally came back it was not Titos. I had been drinking Titos all night, so at this point I'm pretty familiar with the taste.  Instead of the server taking the drink back to the bar and having them remake it, she comes back with the same drink saying \\"the bartender said it is Titos\\".  What?? Is that really service. Nevertheless, I took the drink, but it just sat on the table. Finally, my hookah arrived and it last all of 10 minutes before needing another coal. That took 30 more minutes.

You know that old saying that you're too cool for school? You're never too cool for this school. McMenamins Kennedy School is some place I want to enroll into and NEVER LEAVE. Why? Cause it's not a school.. It's a land of BEER and old stuff made new!\\n\\nThis place is like nothing you have ever seen before and you will be blown away. In fact, being blown away is an understatement. It's a little bit urban exploration mixed in with top grade alcohol enjoyment, a dash of Alamo draft house and with a table spoon of steam punk. \\n\\nI think that's the best way to describe this wonderland. Driving by this at one time elementary school in this residential area you would have never guessed how awesome it is. \\n\\nYou take an old run down school that would be a prime location for nothing more than urban exploration and what I'm sure would have been drug use by junkies and you turn it into a mecca of good food, good drink, entertainment and nightly fun\\n\\nDriving to it I thought we took a wrong turn as there was no way this would be in the middle of a residential area. Sure enough there was a couple of people in front of the elementary school entrance starting up a fire in the outdoor fire place and drinking a pint.,, in front of an old school! I was in a stage of shock.\\n\\nWalking in you see that the halls of what used to be a school are now hallways to something straight out of the 20's. Entertainment, eating establishments and a few bars. Walking down the halls there was at least three events going on.  A birthday celebration here, a private meeting in that room over there. a theater about to play the latest flicks. \\n\\nDetention is a cigar smoke filled room you can drink brandy, sip whiskey and just let it all hang out. Honor roll room is on the other side of the hall and it has a slightly different theme going  for it. Not so much smoke filled and lacking the bad boy element that detention had but keeping all the amazing look of a small room with a lot of booze. \\n\\nThen you get to the broiler room... Oh man, the broiler room. If you're into steam punk or at least old run down but modern looking decor, this would make you jump with glee. I'm sure if all schools had a broiler room like this, the janitor would be glad to do their job. It's not your typical bar but it's everything that is right in the world. \\n\\nThe Broiler room seems to be the best place to get a pint. Which trying both the Ruby Red and the Hammerhead, I think I liked the Ruby Red more. The logo on the drink itself was also really crafty.\\n\\nThat's not to say that the rest of the place is lacking. Holy hell, the whole place is a feast for the eyes. Walls all over the school are filled with arts and other such nice eye treats from local artist as well as history past. From old class pictures of the old old classes, this is a little bit eerie in how haunting it is, though it's also really amazing that you're getting sloshed in what used to be a school.  \\n\\nAgain, this place is amazing in every possible way. I want to live here. Though I can rent a room. Close enough, I guess. \\n\\nIt's very simple, any old school in the country should follow this model if it were to shut down. Turn it into a hotel/restaurant/multiple bar room establishment. \\n\\nI'm simply amazed that the local community allowed this to happen. If this were to even be thought up or brought up to any community in Los Angeles, there would be so many NIMBY's that it would get shut down before it ever even got into the renovation phase. But the concept is amazing. You take an old school and you inject life to the community bringing in tax dollars and bringing in an amazing theater, restaurant and beer center with a look that is all its own while also maintaining historic grounds.\\n\\nIf you're in Portland, you have to go here every now and then.

It's a perfect food choice when you are running away from the rain and want a warm meal. The portion size is average and so is the price. The ramen quality is below average compared to the many ramen places I have eaten at. Though, the Gyoza's are pretty large in size and are above average in quality. They have probably one of the best Gyoza's I have tried. The restaurant is very clean and the customer service is fantastic. The ambiance is pretty quiet which allows you to have a nice conversation or a lunch/dinner meeting. They help reduce the clutter by providing you an area to stick your backpack, purses, or laptop cases beside you.

I chose to hold the peppers and kept the onions which automatically come with each sandwich. The two uncooked onion pieces were hard and bowed up making the bread fall off the bottom part of the sandwich... I ended up taking those off because it was not grilled and matching the pictures on the menu board. \\n\\nNow to the cheese bites... they tasted good, especially with the sauce but it was almost embarrassing in the way they presented it... a few small pieces on a plate...

This place, hands down, had easily taken place in my top three best Indian food experiences.\\n\\nI'm a huge lamb fan, especially with korma, and I practically inhale naan with my curry. Lamb and naan quality are at the pinnacle of what I look for at an Indian restaurant. Here, their lamb is tender and perfectly cooked. There's always a generous amount of large pieces. The naan is soft and spongy. Nothing is ever too oily or dry or overcooked. Their spiciness levels are followed accurately. Korma is naturally mild, so medium for me ends up perfect. Their prices match their competitors, and their serving size is standard, but the quality of the lamb, spices, naan, and rice is pleasantly refreshing in this seemingly vast wasteland of bad Indian food. The fact that they deliver through uber eats and grubhub is bonus points.\\n\\nMy boyfriend, a pescetarian, agrees with me on every aspect. As huge Indian food lovers, this place had gone above and beyond our expectations.

The matter is compounded by the fact that the seating is more uncomfortable than a slab of concrete - after sitting in this place for slightly more than an hour I felt like I needed the assistance of a chiropractor to evacuate. \\n\\nFood: The menu at Folk Art consists of stylized American breakfast, lunch, and brunch fare. Options include things like waffles, pancakes, omelets, salads, sandwiches, and burgers. During my visit for Sunday brunch, I started with the fried pickles and muffin basket, and ended with a banana nut fosters waffle. Both the fried pickles and muffin basket were nicely prepared, but meagerly portioned for the price - the muffin basket, which consisted of five mini-muffins, was particularly underwhelming. The waffle was flavorful, but again, very small, poorly plated, and not accompanied by anything - even a few slices of fruit would have helped resurrect the sad looking plate that arrived. \\n\\nService: Pleasantly incompetent. Although friendly, our waitress was horrifyingly slow and recurrently absent. The time from order to arrival of our food was nearly 40 minutes and we didn't see the waitress once during that time period. We then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes after our plates were cleared to receive the bill.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior of this place is light years away from what it used to be, which was essentially an empty room. The walls are adorned with various southern country knick-knacks. The restaurant consists of a moderately sized covered patio and a slightly larger dining room - there's also limited counter seating available. During my visit, I sat at one of the high-top tables, which had no padding or back on the seat - had I known that I was going to be sitting there for over an hour, I would have declined the seat when the host originally tried to seat us there. \\n\\nCost: Moderately priced. Breakfast entrees are $7-$12 and lunch entrees are $9-$14. Most entrees do not come with any sides, which can be purchased separately for $1.50-$4.\\n\\nOther: Folk Art is located in the same strip of buildings as Wisteria and Il Localino. Free parking is available in the lot to the left of the buildings or along N. Highland Ave. Breakfast and lunch are served Monday-Friday from 7:30AM-11AM and 11AM-3PM, respectively. Brunch is served Saturday and Sunday, 9AM-2:30PM. No reservations are accepted.

I absolutely loved the caviar dish: the saltiness of the caviar with the smoky spiciness of the horseradish and the softness of the avocado and egg really made this an outstanding dish. The poha crusted redfish was also excellent and cooked perfectly. I liked the Indian influence with the spinach saag and paneer that surprisingly did not overpower the fish. \\n\\nThe green curry fumet I thought was very disappointing. It was almost too salty to even eat. I don't really understand what the chef is going for here. Also - I asked for a recommendation among the \\"Field\\" items and was told to go for the soft egg tamale. This was way too rich (goat cheese and mushroom ragu) and didn't have any interesting flavors. I think tamales should be kept in the realm of authentic South American cuisine.\\n\\nThe price of the food is great for the portions. You can pick any three dishes for $40 and add an additional for $10. You can pick all meats or all fishes; doesn't matter.

My girlfriend is vegan so I called ahead of time to make sure they had items on the menu and they said that they have 3 - 4 items every night. They then took note of the time we were arriving and that one of us was vegan. Small point of annoyance: when we got to the restaurant there was one vegan item on the menu and we had to go out of our way to ask about the others instead.

I called (3 times) earlier that day to change the guest count to 18, but no one answered the phone either time. I then received an email confirmation from the restaurant confirming my reservation that gave me the option to modify the guest count; so I did. 11 of my guests showed up and the MANAGER would not seat them. She made them sit in the lobby until 6:15pm, which was when i arrived (after much stalling trying to avoid the collision of guests and honoree). The remaining guests arrived directly after i did. The Manager and staff were very well informed that this was a surprise party and STILL REFUSED to seat my guests. I even called while i was stalling, around the corner from the restaurant and asked them to PLEASE seat my guests because the honoree was coming. NOPE! So the surprise was essentially ruined. The honoree walked in and saw everyone in the lobby. I'm highly perturbed with the level of customer service, the inexperience of the wait staff and the lack of the shift managers ability to make an executive decision or exception for this situation.

Although Santouka is known for their shio (salt) ramen, I personally prefer the goma-miso (sesame miso) ramen because the flavor is more robust, hearty, and fragrant. They offer ramen combos in small, regular, and large sizes but with the soft-boiled egg and choice of shiyake ikura gohan (grilled salmon flake and salmon roe rice bowl), cha-su gohan (braised pork belly rice bowl), gyoza, or karaage (Japanese fried chicken), I find that the small usually suffices. If you prefer to eat only ramen, then perhaps getting a larger sized bowl would be a better option. Alternatively, I would also recommend the Toroniku ramen, in which the toppings are served separately. The slices of pork cheek are so delicate but rich in flavor; Santouka is not exaggerating when they claim it melts in your mouth.

I would have given this 4 stars, but Blue Canoe messed up our reservation. We booked through Open Table a week before Valentine's, and mentioned that we would like a table by the window on the message. On the day of Valentine's, I had a weird feeling and asked my husband to call them to make sure they got our reservation. When he called, the person on the phone sounded like he didn't know at first and sounded hesitant, then later said yes there is a reservation after we told him we booked on Open Table a while back! Hmmm... \\n\\n1) The Negative: When we arrived to Blue Canoe, the hostess at the front looked at our reservation but did not give us a table by the window, because she said they were all reserved. We told her we wrote it on Open Table, but she said she didn't see the note. So now we learned our lesson, say it on the phone because these guys don't read the messages on Open Table. We even checked our Open Table again after the dinner, and the message was still there, so we know it was sent through. They just don't read.\\n\\n2) The Positive: Anyway, the waitress was excellent, she was very attentive, polite, and checked us on every so often. She didn't overdo it, and she had a soft-spoken voice so I really liked that (I can't stand the loud type of waitresses who boom their voices and scare you in mid-eating). She had a blond ponytail, a very sweet girl.\\n\\n3) Somewhat Positive: We did the Valentine's 2015 set Dinner, it was $59 for 3 course meal including a free tea or coffee, what a deal! Both hubby and I chose the Lobster Bisque for the appetizer. The soup itself was creamy and flavorful but we were a little disappointed to find no meat in the soup. My advice is to put something in, even if it were a lobster chunk, crab chuck, or a prawn, at least put something in the soup. For the entree, my husband had the steak and I had the Seafood Pot pie. Mine was excellent, it was so huge I couldn't even finish it and had half taken out. I don't know what my husband's steak was like but he said it was excellent. For dessert, we both ordered the Lava cake. My husband said it was \\"just ok\\". For me, I was a little disappointed in the Vaentine's dessert choice because the 2 choices of dessert was either Tiramisu (which contains coffee/chocolate) or Lava Cake (chocolate). I am not a fan of chocolate or coffee desserts at all. I should have asked for an optional choice but didn't. Oh well. My advice is next time, offer 1 choice of chocolate, and the other one a non-chocolate for us non-chocolate lovers.\\n\\n4) The Positive: The view was beautiful. Definitely loved the view even though we didn't get the window as we requested. \\n\\n5) The Negative: A couple came in and sat beside us and started arguing. Oh my, that was interesting and unexpected for Valentines! The female began flicking her paper menu angrily and it was annoyingly loud. I looked at her to show her that she was being disruptive. She stopped but started hissing at her boyfriend (or husband). They kept talking in low voices and I heard him say, \\"Just tough it out.\\" Wow, I didn't know eating at a lovely restaurant with a water view would be \\"so tough\\" to them. They kept arguing back and forth, then got up and left. It was 20 minutes of tension since we were beside them and could hear them, we were so relieved when they left. \\n\\n6) Just a note: We were so overdressed for the restaurant. I was in a lace dress with heels and husband was in a suit. Everyone else was in really casual wear (jeans, sneakers types), and a few Valentine couples were dressed up but still in casual wear. So if you decide to do a date or event at this restaurant, dress more casual. The atmosphere is like a pier with cottage accents.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was really great. Not wonderful but still really great. Definitely would come back again, but this time, call on the phone to sit by the window. :)"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to the one in Portland that doesn't have a mile-long line out the door.

Supposedly it was the original raw oyester bar in central Florida.\\nOyesters are by far NOT my thing, I find them repulsive, however fret not! This place DOES serve more then oyesters!\\nIf you ARE into oyesters they look VERY fresh and to prove such they individually shuck them for you right there...running at 7$ a dozen and 18$ for a huge bucket, they look like a great deal.  I know places in NYC where you will pay big $ for a place of 3 or 4 half shell oyesters of much more questionable freshnes...so if u dig raw bar...dont miss out on this gem.\\nFor those of us that dont care for gooky, briney, so-called aphrodesiacs there is also Topneck Clams, Crab, Crab Cakes, Fried Clam Strips, and chicken fingers, flounder as well as chicken nuggets and corndogs for landlovers and kids, altho this isnt really a venue thats designed for children....its very basic minimal local style more like a bar...so not a trendy date spot or a great family spot....but a great spot none the less.\\nThe beer here is a wonderful deal, altho a limited selection.  Mugs of draft and bottles run a mere 3$....and pitchers $7 and change.  Many tourist places here as well as anywhere back home will charge u double that for just a bud.  \\nThe place has multiple lunch basket specials which we intend to go back and try that run about 8$.   An 8$ basket of fried shrimp with a 3$ beer?  Thats a great lunch.  ESPECIALLY for the #1 tourist trap city in the US.  They do takeout....but no takeout for raw oyesters, sorry.\\n\\nThe crowd was lively and the place is a bit loud...but that adds to the appeal!  The service was VERY friendly and attentive and when u get oyesters, you definately get personalized service...and shame on he who doesnt tip your shell shucker...these guys earn their tip!!!\\nWe ordered a half pound of iced steamed shrimp(8$) and a chicken finger basket /w fries(9$).\\nThe shrimp came with a very liberal dashing of Old Bay season (ack!)...but as its peel ur own, its all on the shell not the shrimp....the shrimp were perfectly tender and sooooo fresh and the portion was huge of moderately sized shrimps....a good deal in our view.  The chicken tenders were nice and crispy....but ya cant screw up that dish even if u tried.  lol\\n\\nAll in all WITH beer dinner came to under $20. \\n\\n YES, YOU HEARD ME RIGHT...no need to get ur glasses...... DINNER FOR TWO IN ORLANDO FOR UNDER 20$!  SUCK ONE DISNEY RESTAURANTS AND PLANET HOLLYWOOD!\\nGuys...trust me...it PAYS to NOT be a tourist and explore your surroundings!  \\n\\nWe're DEFINITELY coming back to this joint a few more times b4 we leave orlando for lunch!

We order some baked ricotta, mozzarella, and roasted pears for starters. We got baked ricotta, mozzarella, and white beans. The roasted pears were brought out quickly and the beans were left for us to taste. Not a deal breaker, but annoying. The pizza was fabulous. We ordered one Margherita pizza and one Roasted Squash pizza. I cannot say enough about how perfectly cooked the crust was on these pies...just the right amount of char from the wood burning oven...firm to the bite on the outside and moist and chewy inside. Perfect. The toppings were top notch. I honestly did not expect much from the Roasted Squash pizza. Man, was I wrong...it was a perfect blend of buttery roasted butternut squash with the chicken sausage providing the perfect spark of heat. The best thing on the table? Those freakin Roasted Pears! Roasted pears, red onions, gorgonzola and walnuts...wow. Thanks for giving me something else to obsess about. This was a very good dining experience for our group that could have easily been elevated to a great experience with a little effort from the server. I noticed she turned on the charm and actually smiled...when she delivered the check. This did not go unnoticed by our group.

I did not realize that Jinya was an international chain restaurant at the time of my visit, but thought I would include that tidbit in my review.\\n\\nDecor/Environment: This restaurant is not very big on the inside, but it makes for somewhat of a cozy setting. Everything looked clean and there was a nice touch of Asian decor as well as some greenery (even if it might have been fake). There is outside seating on a patio to the front of the restaurant as you enter, and there are umbrellas at tables to provide some shade on a sunny day.\\n\\nFood: Tried the Jinya Bun, Crispy Chicken, Cha Cha Cha ramen, and the Spicy Chicken Ramen. The Jinya Bun was absolutely delicious and by far the best thing I ate that day. The Crispy Chicken was a bit disappointing...it had a weird texture and outer batter of chicken fried steak, and it was not the crunchy, plump juicy pieces of chicken I was expecting of a usual karaage. The Cha Cha Cha ramen wasn't too bad, but the fish broth was a very pronounced fishy flavor that overpowered the dish so I probably won't get that again. The Spicy Chicken Ramen was good, and considering I don't usually get chicken broth ramen (I'm more of a Tonkatsu kind of gal, but wanted to branch out on this trip), I would actually get this dish again.\\n\\nService: The service was ok, they weren't overly friendly, but they weren't rude. However, the host that day was a young and energetic fellow and he was absolutely pleasant and helpful in explaining the dishes and making recommendations while waiting to be seated.\\n\\nOverall, if I'm ever back out that way, I would certainly give Jinya another shot and make sure I try their Tonkatsu ramen next time :)"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Long line, extremely horribly rude service, the donut wasnt anything special or better than a Super market donut.

Top of the Hub is one of those \\"experience\\" places.  You go here for your anniversary, for your 50th birthday, and when your Nona turns 100.  But that's kind of it.    \\n\\nIt's got a nice view and we got a beautiful table right at the corner of the restaurant, which made for more than a few drunken conversations while we haphazardly tried to figure out where key spots in Boston were (from 52 floors up).  The drinks are so  damn strong.  We got two cocktails to start off the night and felt like we were buzzed (read: hammered) from the start.  Then, out of interest in making our 2nd anniversary extra special, added on the wine pairings, and got progressively, positively loaded.  It made for a good time, and probably kept me from really appreciating how the food was good (but not great), the wine pairings were appropriate (but not terribly on point ... you'd expect the choices to be something you wouldn't just have sitting in your own apartment wine rack), and at 4 stars, the price was expected, but didn't entirely seem right.  \\n\\nSo, the damage was $230 with tip for a three-course meal with wine pairings and  two cocktails.  The consumption: lobster soup, beet salad, lamb shank, sirloin steak, creme brulee, pineapple cobbler.  The lobster soup was amazing, and the salad was really creative with a tonne of mozzarella cheese.  The entrees were a bit crushingly BIG.  My lamb shank made me feel like I was from the Flintstones, but it was good -- just a lot of it.  And the steak probably would have been good if my wife didn't decide \\"well-done\\" and got some cooked rubber concoction.\\n\\nOverall we had fun, got quite pleasantly boozed, and the view was oh-so sexy, but when you pay $230 if you're not jumping to a 5-star right away, you kind of think you should be ...

I had pretty high expectations and boy there's nothing better than a good hot dog.  However, I just felt like they were trying too hard to be \\"cool.\\"  First of all, every dog on the menu is way too complicated.  I had a hard time imagining what some of the meat combos would taste like and once I finally did choose both sausages I tried didn't have much flavor at all.  The buns were far too large and dry - they really took away from what might have made these good.  \\n\\nI split the Notorious P.I.G. and the Texalina with my man.  Who can resist anything with so much pig meat topped with mac and cheese?  It was definitely my favorite of the two but still nothing to write home about.  The Texalina had far too little flavor - the description talks about white cheddar and bbq sauce.  There was a tiny drizzle of sauce on the bottom and maybe a dusting of cheddar on top.  Not at all what I expected.  \\n\\nThe plain waffle fries were pretty good and the boudin fritters were by far the highlight of the meal.  They were perfectly fried - super crispy, spicy...delicious.  \\n\\nDessert was decent but again...I didn't feel like they delivered on their descriptions.  I had the Frankencookie - it came with candied bacon that had been so candied you could no longer tell it was bacon.  Actually...I'm pretty sure they didn't even serve us what the description said.  Everyone at the table tried the ice cream and agreed it was not coffee but just normal Amy's sweet cream and our cookie was completely different than the one our friend had (she just ordered the straight up chocochip/bacon cookie).  I'm pretty sure ours was just chocolate chip.  I mean...come on people!\\n\\nOutside of the food this place was just wonderful.  I loved the ambiance, the decorations, the music.

The gator was in nugget sized pieces and so it was hard not to think of chicken nuggets. But it seemed to have a softer yet a little chewier taste to it. which I enjoyed. The breading just needing more seasoning IMO.\\n\\nI ordered the filet au poivre as my main entree. The filet was perfectly cooked, medium rare. The sauce that was with the french fries was a tad too salty, but overall good. \\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with a Banana's foster creme brulee.

On a different note, Salsa Mora's is not using glorified ingredients such as huitlacoche or braised goat in \\"crazy\\" tacos. Rather, it is sticking to the 2-item breakfast taco in a trailer that would otherwise appear to be another Torchy's or the like.\\n\\nThat being said, I was happy to see mushrooms and avocado on the item list. At $1.50 a pop, these 2-fers were quite the affordable parcels with which to satisfy your quota for the most important meal of the day.\\n\\nMy avocado and blackbean possessed both items being in mashed form--quite the creamy taco. The potato and mushroom offered nicely roasted fungi with a heavy hand of salt--much salt I enjoy in my cultivated fungus. Also, the salt gave a nice touch to the roasted potatoes. Potatoes and mushrooms are two items of produce that I can strongly disfavor, if not well-salted!\\n\\nAndy, this man running this edgy trailer in a lot with a Jamaican trailer and another cranking out pierogis, is awesome.

To be Frank with you, the overall experience came up a bit short.  \\n\\nParking is horrid, you can't just drive up and grab a dog, it's just like parking for bar night - although I know that's not Frank's fault.  I was greeted by two lovely hostesses who offered to seat me in the dining area or bar.  And that's where I made my mistake - - I chose the bar.  \\n\\nAfter sitting down and reviewing the menu for at least 10 minutes, I still wasn't approached for any service.  There were 2 bartenders - skinny bearded guy (SBG) and big bald tattoo dude (BBT), as well as the Cappuccino Guy (CG) right across from me.  It wasn't that busy, yet all three seemed like they were in their own little world.  I had to literally stare down SBG just to get some attention.  Maybe I need to grow breasts....?  \\n\\nI got the Chicago Dog, small Waffle Fry Nachos, and a side of Frank Sauce.  About 6-8 minutes later the kitchen runner (Matt) came out w/ my order - - that was impressive.  He was very friendly, so I asked him for other recommendations, at which he immediately said the \\"County Fair\\" (beef Vienna dog , porked topped with crispy onion rings and spicy horseradish sauce).  He was so emphatic about it that I had to put in the order.  Meanwhile my Chicago Dog was pretty damn good, waffle nacho fries were solid, now if I can only get SBG to fill my water - - which has now been empty for at least 10 minutes.  Sheesh...I ask again, do I need to grow breasts?    \\n\\nHere comes my County Fair - Matt was right, it was damn good, however, I still prefer the Chicago Dog since I'm partial (being from the Midwest).  Meanwhile, SBG then proceeds to walk out of Frank to apparently run an errand (?).  That leaves the cleanup w/ BBT, who starts off not too friendly but eventually warms up.  He gets nicer, but his customer service is inconsistent as I had to ask the CG to give BBT my credit card so I could get rung up - because I was waiting (again) for at least 10 minutes.  Maybe I need to look into this breast thing.  \\n\\nAs I'm waiting, another patron sits down next to me, he's also flat chested, and I watch him go through w/ the same ill-fated-poor-service-routine.  He waits longer than I did in getting served, and becomes noticeably impatient.  I don't know if we just caught these guys on a bad night, but this poor-service thing is starting to become a common theme.  If it wasn't for the tasty Chicago Dog and friendly Matt, I would have settled for 2-stars, not ordered anything else, and left a very unimpressive tip.    \\n\\nThis location should also serve as a \\"lessons learned\\".  From what I can recall, there have been at least 3-4 businesses that have opened and closed in this very spot w/in the past 10 yrs, including Crimson's back in 2003 - which was actually a nice restaurant that couldn't stay afloat.

The lemon chiffon crueler was topped with marshmallows and fluff so though good, I didn't taste any lemon. The blueberry cake was good enough--tied with Dunkin Donuts version.

Granted, since none of us had been before, I called ahead to see if they could accommodate 8 folks and they said if we got there quick they had two tables they could push together for us.  So, being the soberest, I rounded up the group, we paid our prodigious tab at Dive Bar, downed that last drink, and I herded them the block and a half up the street with all the focus of a crew of catnip tweaked kittens.\\n\\nOnce safely (for the rest of the world) off the street, Cherry Street really took care of us.  Finding carafes of water on the table was a blessing.  We needed dilution STAT.  Our sweet babysitter, er, waiter, John,  patiently waited while we finally settled on our drinks and appetizers.  They have a full bar which made our Makers and Knob Creek drinkers happy and they also have a list of cocktails made with Italian liqueurs you'll never be able to pronounce.  I, of course, had the Licentious (rolls right off the tongue...Lie-Sensuous) which tasted like a love chile of Amaretto Sour and Tootsie Pop Drops.  Some of us also split a bottle of wine.  Their wine list is fairly small and limited to Italian wines, all but one white and one red sold only by the bottle.  But bottle prices are very affordable at about $29 each.\\n\\nThe apps were pretty good with the favorite being the meatballs served in a hot crock (Holy Hot Crock o' Balls!).  The risotto balls were kinda bland but the papperdew peppers app added a little spice to the palette.  Their dinner menu is also fairly small which is great for a group of, er, befuddled people.  They have a range of salads, about 10 individual sized pizzas, a few paninis, and a few pasta entrees.  The pizza I ordered with sopressata, mushrooms, fontina and a fried egg on top was delicious!  One pizza is plenty for one person, or perfect for one person to eat most of it and trade a slice for someone else's gnocchi (that gnocchi was fabulous!).  For you aficionados, the crust did have a good char on it which for me is too bitter and covers the flavor of the bread, but it's similar to any wood fired pizza, like Backspace.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is small and very pretty with stone walls and hardwood floors.  Unfortunately it, um, CAN get loud in there.  We were sweetly but firmly reprimanded by a little ole grandma on how loud we were (we're all in our 40's and felt like kids in Sunday School...awesome!).  The head bartender asked \\"hey is she bothering you?\\"  and I think he woulda thrown her out to the curb had we asked (JK) but instead, one of our group sent over complimentary drinks to their table.

Voodoo just happens to be on everyone's lists because of how quirky a lot of the flavors are.

Not exactly what I was expecting with the hollandaise sauce. It sort of sounded like jalapenos were in the sauce, but it was a big grilled jalapeno on top.

So, Curiosity satisfied and I would probably try something else next time.\\n\\nThe wife had Shrimp and Grits that I thought was fantastically shrimpy and spicy in flavor, although I am not a grits lover.

I've had fancy food trailer mac n' cheese before, and this just tasted like mac n' cheese but with salad dressing on it. I asked myself, \\"I paid $5 for this??\\"\\n\\nREDEEMING FACTORS\\n\\nThe owners are super kind-hearted, and one of them did come out later and give me a coupon for a free side because of the mess-up with the tenders.

Kind of backwards, and lazy, if you ask me..."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm semi-conflicted in how to write this review, actually.  This place had a number of pros and cons, some of which I knew going in and some which are more matters of personal preference than issues with the restaurant.  I'll detail my experience and let you judge.\\n\\nFirst, the main reason we booked a reservation here was to have convenient access (after dinner) to watch some of the Atlanta Beltline Lantern Parade.  That part eventually worked out well.  So we reserved a table at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday night.\\n\\nYou access the restaurant from Ralph McGill Blvd. There is a small sign about the restaurant, and you continue to see somewhat vague signs about valet parking as you proceed.  It literally took us 15 minutes (including waiting in the wrong conga-line of cars for some other establishment's valets) and 3 passes by the spot to eventually guess where to enter for valet parking.  In short, if I were to come back to TUL, I would NOT drive (or I'd park elsewhere and walk to it via the Beltline).  That said, when we finally *did* get to the valet station, the guy who picked up our car (Connor) was so polite and helpful that I could almost overlook the rest of the experience.  My impression from observations later was that most of the valets were similarly customer-friendly in spite of the obvious pressures of the job.  I would prefer to self-park whenever possible, but I had to give a lot of credit to the valet staff here. \\n\\nOnce inside, we checked in (barely in time for our reservation) and were told we would get txt-ed when our table was ready (probably a few minutes).  It took about 10+ minutes, but we did get the txt.  The only issue at this point is that there is NO waiting area.  You have to either sit at the bar or find some unoccupied dining space to mill around in.  And short waits here seemed common, so there definitely is a need for some sort of holding area.\\n\\nThe noise level inside it loud.  I knew that going in, but it isn't really something I enjoyed.  Also:  the place is huge inside, so it can hold a LOT of diners.  They do seem to have a small army of servers too.\\n\\nWe got seated and our waiter showed up quickly.  He was quite friendly/professional and guided us through the menu initially.  He explained how the starters/small plates/entrees were laid out, how their graduated wine-pours worked, etc.  He got our drink order and promised some bread.  We never got it initially (I think he asked someone to bring it but it never arrived).  He later offered us 'more bread' (thinking we'd finished the first one?) and the bread was quite good.  We got our drinks and he took our salad order but suggested we wait on the entree until he explained more.  Later, he came back and just took the entree order (?).  It was about 50 minutes after our reservation time when we placed that order.  Normally this might have bothered me, but given that the overall intent was to pace the meal such that we got to see the parade, I didn't mind.  Also, I was debating between a burger and the enchiladas.  The burgers are 'limited availability' and the limit had run out, apparently.\\n\\nWe got our food and it was pretty good.  My wife's steak was prepared well and she also liked the mashed potatoes.  I enjoyed my cheese enchiladas also.  We wrapped up as the parade started to come by.  The total bill (including ~ 2.5 drinks) was just over $100.\\n\\nWe checked out the parade for a while next to the TUL patio.  By around 9:30 p.m. we wanted to head out.  We then got back to the valet station.  It took a few minutes to pass along our ticket to a valet and they didn't offer any guidance on where to wait.  We noticed some people drifting down to be further out near the parking lot (vs. the sort of u-turn portico where you drop-off) so we wandered out there.  We hoped to intercept the valet and skip some time in the line.  We succeeded, and were able to exit the lot.  We then spent about 5 minutes in a traffic back-up getting to North Ave.  It was approaching 10 p.m. when we finally were heading home.\\n\\nI doubt I'll return here, but that is not a reflection on TUL.  It just isn't what I'm personally looking for in terms of dining out.  It did meet my expectations for that particular evening, though."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Not worth the hype.

See review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/anastos-corner-cafe-hull#hrid:JVs3NynsQ2AkTkhI1leQjg. \\n\\nHaving read the Yelp reviews I didn't have the highest expectations for this place, but hoped for the best. It claims to be the oldest restaurant in America and I had planned on getting lobster (how can you mess up lobster right?), so we figured we'd give it a try. Like the other reviewers we found it way overpriced for the quality of food and service. \\n\\nThe restaurant was pretty packed when we were there and they gave us a table on the third floor. This was a bit difficult for our 89 year old grandmother to navigate, but we complied seeing that there were few tables open. The third floor was very hot at least a few degrees hotter than the second and first floors-uncomfortably hot. The tables are all cramped together and the chairs are super uncomfortable even for the folks in our party with tiny tushies.  \\n\\nBy the time our beer got to us from the 2nd floor it was kind of warm, our waitress was obviously overwhelmed having to tend to many tables, and our food was sub-par. Most of the entrees come with one side the best of which is a baked potato still wrapped in tinfoil. My husband wanted to try the \\"best baked beans\\" since we were in Boston. They were OK but not worth the seven bucks they charge for a side of baked beans. I had the lobster and had the worst experience I've ever had with lobster. It was nearly impossible to get out of the shell. We broke two metal claw crackers trying to get the claws open until I finally just gave up. I don't understand if it was the way it was prepared or just really poor quality tools but it was bad.\\n\\nNone of us wanted to stay for dessert.

I definitely plan on coming back, and bringing others with me.\\n\\nThis Friday, after skipping breakfast, having salad for lunch, and working late into the night, I decided to walk from the office to a place where I could enjoy a filling dinner. The first place I went to had an incredibly long wait, and Poor Calvin's was the restaurant with the highest Yelp rating within walking distance.\\n\\nI sat at the bar, and both the hostess and bartender were very friendly. I started with a locally brewed Sweetwater 420 and the lobster mac & cheese appetizer. At first, I didn't want to like the lobster mac because I felt there wasn't enough lobster, but every bite seemed to have a chunk or two of claw meat. On top of that, the blend of cheeses and the sheer volume of the serving made this lobster mac enough to be a standalone meal.\\n\\nFor my entree, I chose the grilled lamb rack, medium rare (of course). Let me just say that this dish had a blend of flavors that would not stop! On the very top of the kale mashed potatoes, there was a cherry tomato stuffed with a blend of feta cheese and... what else, I don't really know. But it bursts in your mouth when you bite it and is so good! The dish is served with a Thai curry sauce that goes well with the lamb and potatoes. It took me about an hour to finish the plate because I wanted to make sure I enjoyed every bite. I even picked up the lamb by the bones to get the last scraps of meat, and was tempted to lick the remaining sauce off the plate!\\n\\nI wasn't particularly in the mood for dessert, but when the bartender described \\"The Suspension Cake,\\" I couldn't resist. The Suspension Cake is a minty cheesecake, suspended between two layers of red velvet cake, all encased in a chocolate fudge shell, and is just as good as the picture in your mind's eye suggests it is.\\n\\nWhat's great about this place is that any portion of my meal - appetizer, entree, or dessert - could have easily been a great experience by itself.

I had a bowl of lobster bisque and a side of Brussel sprouts. Both were extremely tasty. The lobster bisque had a texture more like soup, not thick enough to be called bisque, but deeply flavorful, so no quibble on the texture. The large chunks of lobster were plentiful. The Brussels were very good, too. Two in our party had the wedge salad, both raved about it. It looked amazing.

And they do have good service which is always a plus.\\n\\nThey start you off with some warm, soft bread and olive oil to dip it in. A friend ordered some calamari to start. It's pretty good, but the it's very thick and chewy. It's almost like the texture of eating shrimp rather than traditional calamari. Another friend ordered a portabella caprese starter. This was great and had a strong hint of a vinaigrette, though it doesn't mention that in the description.\\n\\nI was looking forward to ordering the grilled mahi, but they were out of mahi, so I ordered the grilled salmon picata instead. It wasn't really anything special. The salmon was cooked well, but the sauce was a little blah. A friend ordered a pizza that I will rave about. Perfectly soft crust and deliciously cheesy and garlic-y. They also have a coupon on the website for a BOGO pizza if you get a hankering to try it."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Worth the line! Voodoo was a must for our Portland trip! Only had it once before when a friend brought it back and it was fun designs and delicious flavors! So when planning my Portland trip I knew this was a must! We went on a Saturday late afternoon... there is a parking lot across from voodoo that is actually pricey! I would look around a little more and find a cheaper one! However, the one across from voodoo has the \\"keep Portland weird\\" wall mural which is a must take picture with if you are planning doing everything Portland! The line went pretty quick and the crowd was fun. Once we got in it was cash only but they do have an ATM inside of you need to get money. We got 2 dozens... one dozen we specifically picked out which is around $26 and the voodoo special they pick and its around $18. Loved the maple bacon and the maple blunt the best! All their raised donuts were so soft and fresh. Will be back next trip to Portland!"},{"name":"Ask For Luigi","address":"305 Alexander Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"First of all, they don't take reservations. I understand that this is a small place, but it ALWAYS has a wait list for dinner. We were determined to try it, so we put our names down on the two hour waitlist and went over to cuchillo for drinks. We fully waited 2.5 hours (getting the text that our table was ready at 10pm when we had arrived there at 730) and their rules are that you have to come within 15 minutes otherwise they give it away (why not just allow reservations?). Anyways cuchillo was fantastic, they knew why we were there and empathized about the wait. We had some AMAZING drinks and a taco and guac appetizer there which (sorry) were kind of better than the meal at ask for luigi. I will definitely be going back to cuchillo. But back to the review -\\n\\nWe got the text at 10 pm and by that time we were sloshed (after spending 80 bucks at cuchillo). I dont quite feel bad about this because what else were we supposed to do for 2 hours in the downtown eastside? Anyways we got to the restaurant and were seated at a tiny but cozy table. The place feels like it used to be an old diner or deli, converted to a restaurant. I get what they're going for (upscale italian fare in a cozy, homey place that doesnt discriminate) but honestly it doesn't work. It just feels underwhelming. Next up were the severs, who didn't really seem to know a heck of a lot about the menu (lots of 'um' and 'let me check') and were kind of dismissive for such a small place. I also found the food underwhelming- for 30 bucks a plate it had better be good. We had 2 apps, a main each, and a desert. We had the rabbit ciccioli and the meatballs. The rabbit was good but tasted like a tuna spread and not so much like rabbit. The meatballs were very underwhelming. I had high expectations but I felt they were underseasoned. The sauce was simple and nice- delicious. But the meatballs really needed more seasoning. The mains were squid ink corzetti and radiatore. They were tasty, solid dishes, but again- 26 bucks for a meatless pasta in plain tomato sauce? It was simple and elegant, but I felt too pricey for what it was. The squid ink was tasty and I liked it better than my own. It came with quite a few mussels, which were cooked to perfection. Fennel sausage nowhere to be found (?) but still a very good dish. For desert we had the chocolate budino and holy cow it was probably the only thing worth the price. If the wait time wasnt so astronomical I would go back just for the budino. It was AMAZING and the only reason, along with the corzetti, that this restaurant gets my third star.\\n\\nOverall impression? The term 'overrated' comes to mind. I am a HUGE fan of savio volpe, and since ask for luigi is run by one of the partners in savio volpe I was very excited to eat there. At savio we always get the chef's menu and it always comes out to about 75 bucks a person with a few drinks. The menu is delicious, ever changing, innovative, and offers you the perfect amount of food and variety for the price. The severs are always knowledgeable and the atmosphere is amazing. Maybe I put too much of my impression at savio volpe on ask for luigi, but it truly flops in comparison. Will definitely be returning for cuchillo for dinner though."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is an absolute gem.

Good crowd.\\n\\nEach of us got a Chicago dog and a side - he got waffle fries, and me, baked beans.  Chicago dog was perfect - just the right balance between bun and dog, relish, tomato, mustard, pickle, & peppers.  Nice soft squishy yellow bun with poppy seeds (check your teeth in the mirror before going back to work).  Ketchup was right on the table if you needed it.  The baked beans were excellent - sweet with tasty salty bits of bacon - and came in a decent-sized bowl large enough for sharing.  The waffle fries looked pretty basic - I didn't have any but they looked pale - much less crisp & brown than I would have liked. Water/tea came in faux hillbilly-style mason jars, napkins were brown and made of recycled paper (yay).  \\n\\nWas it worth the drive?

(To be said in a spanish accent, of course). I've heard so many people tell me how truly delightful this little Bistro is and I always, always forget to check it out since I have the memory span of a beta fish. Well, last Thursday I got off work at 11am and luckily enough, someone had mentioned it at 10:59:55am, which gave me time to phone my brother and let him know it would be that day's preplanned lunch destination, before my seven seconds were up and my memory lapsed....yet again. We arrived on E. 11th and I was simply stoked when we walked through those doors. Can we say precious? It was elegant, yet....laid back and very inviting. As I looked at the menu I was shocked to see that everything was reasonably priced. Usually, a sensual setting + a sensual dining selection means splitting a dish with your partner while having a garnish and a crouton as an appetizer, but not here. We're experiencing a recession and Blue Dahlia humors that. Bless you, gracious food providers of Austin. I can enjoy an inexpensive meal and still retain a small degree of dignity. Not like the feeling that immediately follows ordering something off of the dollar menu at Wendy's and eating in the parking lot while the food falls out of my gaping mouth due to my incessant sobbing and choking wondering where I went wrong in life. Now, you have a decent selection in the area of salads, sandwiches and \\"specialty\\" items, the latter of which includes platters of meat or cheese. Um, cheese platters? Girl, if only a such a thing could be anatomically comparable to a man. Like, for serious. Naked time. X-rated. Close the curtains. BAM!! However, when it's 106degrees outside, indulging in such a dish wouldn't be the wisest choice bc within moments my mouth would turn into Mt. Vesuvius and that's just nasty. Don't get me wrong though, I will TOTALLY hit it up on cooler day and straight OWN that shit. No doubt. Hell, there's even a happy hour on those platters....w/ vino!! Heaven. So, under the \\"Tartines\\" section I chose the hummus, avocado, sprouts and tomato, while my brother went with the smoked salmon w/ garlic & herb spread. As I sat there feeling fancy and foreign, what I anticipated was not at all what finally arrived. These sandwiches are brought out on stone plates, which are shaped like hexagons, and served in an unusual fashion. They use one large piece of thick, wheat bread, apply the spread, then lay the toppings in a decorative fashion. It's cut up in long, narrow slices, which creates the sensation of finger foods at a fancy picnic...like they have in Europe..... like the movie, Emma, hahaha. I was tickled to the max. Now, being the vocal girl I am, one would expect a scene to be created, potentially resulting in me being escorted out and asked never to return, but I respected my environment, as well as the time of day. It was early lunch in a tiny bistro leaving you within verrrry close proximity of fellow diners, I mean.....we're talkin' a one foot radius here. So, I merely closed my eyes, slightly moaned under my breath and enjoyed the most uniquely divine sandwich I've experience in quite some time. As I excused myself to the bathroom I noticed that they even have a little patio in the back and I'm a HUGE fan of such a thing come nightfall, especially if  X-mas lights are strewn about. That's my favorite. Of course, w/ nightfall comes a frightening level of comfort, and thy true self.....could be revealed, hahaha. Brace yourself, bistro. Mama's comin'.....bust out that vino!!"},{"name":"Inka Chicken","address":"1707 Wells Branch Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Chicken and sides are yummy.\\nit's different than most other chicken places, but didn't give off any huge reason to return."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My only complaint against Home Slice is that they only have two locations and it can take awhile to get seated or service.\\n\\nOther than that, the pizza is the best in Austin, good salads as well to start off with.

You could taste the different cheeses distinctly, the arugula added a little fresh taste, and there was this hint of lemon over everything - and let's not forget the speck - delicious.  This will be my go to pizza when I return.\\n\\nThe only downside to The Backspace is that with only one oven, sometimes it can take awhile to get your pizza.  After our 1st round of pizzas, we ordered some more and it took a good 30-40 minutes because by then the place was packed and there were several orders ahead of us."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The donuts aren't special as far as taste... that's why the 4 stars.

There are mostly big macrobrew beers like Goose Island (AB InBev), Smithwick's/Guinness (Diageo), Batch 19 (Molson Coors), etc. They also usually have one or two Harpoon and Sam Adams offerings as well, but that's pretty much it in terms of unique variety.\\n\\nI've tried some other grub here, which seems pretty hit or miss.

I had the lunch special which was salad and pizza with a drink for $9.  The pizza didn't have cheese on it so I requested cheese on mine.  It was a basic cheese pizza.  To add cheese it was $4 which I thought was a bit ridiculous since they just lightly put cheese on the pizza.  Anyway, Stephen had a calzone which looked delicious and he ate every bite.  It was enough to share but he was being greedy because it was so good.  We finished with the Nutella dessert which was delicious.. Our waitress was nice but could of used a bit more personality.

The first visit was in August or so. My husband and I noticed it in a strip mall and decided to give it a shot for lunch. There's not a lot of Italian places up this way and we really like Italian (and detest Olive Garden), so we were hopeful, but guarded. There was a steady stream of people and it looked okay, so in we went.\\n\\nThe hostess was very nice. The decor in the restaurant is a little hokey. Our server, though, was awful. She was too busy talking to the regulars and chit-chatting that we felt completely ignored, or in her way. The breadsticks we got were limp and overly buttered. My husband got a stromboli, which he said was pretty good and I got Mediterranean pizza that was to DIE for. The crust. OMG. It still wasn't enough though to make up for the lackluster service and bottom of the barrel breadsticks.\\n\\nWe waited but decided to go back, give them another try. Maybe it was an off night, right? This time, we decided to hit them up for dinner and bring the kids (who will go anywhere as long as there is pizza). The kids had pepperoni pizza (shocker) and completely loved it. They raved about it. I had cannoli and the husband had a spicy shrimp dish. The service was absolutely wonderful, the breadsticks were done perfectly, and we all felt very comfortable and happy.\\n\\nWe kind of want to go back there for lunch again, but I'm wondering if this is one of those places where you basically have to be a regular to be noticed at lunch, or if we had some fluke the first time. This place could easily sift into our regular rotation and probably will. Well worth a visit, I don't know how \\"authentic\\" it is as I've never been to Italy, but the food is really good.

It has apparently been taken over by a Muchas Gracias that skimped on extravagant flourishes like a fresh coat of paint.  This was confirmed when I entered the restaurant as they haven't even bothered to replace the trademark Skipper's porthole windows.\\n\\nFor the uninitiated, Muchas Gracias is a chain of restaurants that offers inexpensive Mexican food similiar to what you get in southern California.  I imagine that these restaurants are very popular with the migrant worker crowd. \\n\\nThe best thing that Muchas Gracias offers are their chicken and beef tacos.  After ordering my chicken tacos and horchata, I sat down in their circa 1960 bench tables and admired my run down surroundings.\\n\\nGranted, the tacos, beans and rice were decent and inexpensive at $6.30.

I appreciated the old school diner feel because it really brings you back in time. Unfortunately the food was just really bad and the hip ambiance did not make up for it. \\n\\nThe menu is split up into two sections \\"sassy\\" and \\"classy.\\" I did not even bother considering the \\"sassy\\" dishes because I am a bit of a health nut and those dishes were fried and extremely unhealthy. In Yelp, it is categorized as a \\"seafood restaurant\\" however the menu had limited options for seafood entrees. I look for dishes that are high in protein (particularly seafood) and low in carbs. The only dish I could get was the mussels but they just an appetizer. The Mussels Piccatta is served with lemon vermouth, capers and parsley. The broth was tasty and the capers were a nice complement to the dish. I tried the curried polenta cakes with mushrooms and spinach, which bland and too salty. For my entr√©e, I only had one option to select from since I don't really red meat for health reasons. I selected the gnocchi with bacon, peas, bay scallops, mint, lemon and wine. Sounds absolutely scrumptious, doesn't it? Unfortunately it was far from scrumptious. All I could taste was SALT. There were barely any scallops in the dish. I understand scallops are expensive but it was a total rip off. The bacon was completely white and basically just bacon fat. It was disgusting! The gnocchi was thick and heavy and the sauce was too creamy and salty. \\n\\nOverall, I was sincerely disappointed in the food at Merrill and Co. They have limited healthy options and all of the dishes are VERY SALTY!!! When dishes use copious amounts of salt, it is usually because they are trying to make up for lack of flavor. I had to drink gallons of water to rehydrate my body from this toxic meal. Excess salt is a major pet peeve of mine and because it just makes you feel gross and bloated.

Parking is limited in the actual lot, but there is plenty of it on the neighborhood streets.\\n\\nLike Yeah! Burger or Farm Burger, you order at the front counter.  You can build your own beef, turkey or veggie burger or you can choose from one of their pre-made suggestions. They have plenty of toppings ranging from the normal to the obscure like pimento cheese. You can also pick between a single and double stack.  I opted for the classic Grindhouse style beef burger with lettuce, Grindhouse sauce, grilled onions and cheddar cheese. My friend ordered a custom veggie burger and we split an order of the \\"frings\\". The price point was around $10 for each of us.\\n\\nI knew I was going to like my burger when it came compactly wrapped in parchment paper.  The burger was very tasty.  The bun was soft, the toppings were well balanced and the burger didn't fall apart.  The frings were also really good.  The fries are crinkle fries with spices similar to zaxby's fries.  The rings are thin with well sticking batter.  I was really happy with our food.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at Grindhouse is casual, friendly and trendy.

But I cannot. I really, really cannot. \\n\\nYou should know:\\n- I'm pro-Vegetarian (I'm omni but only because I'm a basically a food addict. I admire people who make sacrifices in their diet either for health or for animal welfare, especially the latter)\\n- I've eaten at *many* all veg restaurants, all over the country\\n- I'm a good home cook, and I cook for a strict, grown adult vegetarian every single day. I know a few things. \\n\\nThe buffalo cauliflower tacos were pretty ok. I won't say \\"good\\", but neither will I say \\"just ok\\". They were close to good, but I think it's just because they're fried and drenched in oil, and you always want a moderate amount of fat in a taco. So they were oily, tangy, spicy.  Kinda good. I don't know that I'd return just for those though, like I do for the buffalo wings at City O City. \\n\\nI ordered the jackfruit enchilada. My husband ordered the spaghetti squash peanut noodles. They were both an utter disgrace to vegetarian cooking. \\n\\nThe enchilada had more 5 times more tortilla than filing (and gross, flour tortillas that were without any flavor and seemed stale), the jackfruit filling was bland and gummy, and the whole thing was topped with just an indescribable mess. There was no distinction of the components: the bland, too sweet, not-\\"deep\\"-enough mole was buried under what I can only call a \\"glop\\" of the \\"salsa\\", which was pretty much canned beans and... (Not sure if fresh, was not clear) pineapple. No lime, no salt, no heat. The verde rice was... not great but it was most of what I ate. The rice, guys! \\n\\nThe peanut noodles were ridiculously horrific. What a gross pile of shit, visually. (Not kidding, it's almost all brown.) I mean, peanut sauce - there are few things in life better than a good peanut sauce, and it was the one potentially interesting thing in that dish.  (\\"You had one job!\\") And it sucked. Unseasoned, bitter, not saucy... not a great choice for spaghetti squash in the first place, IMO. It's great to not use fish sauce but christ, at least add some soy. \\n\\nI'm not convinced that the kitchen has professional experience. \\n\\nService was mostly fine. When we walked in the guy at the bar and the other person walking around seemed confused as to whose job it was to seat us, and eventually, it was the guy behind the bar. He was our server and was actually pretty good.

Overall the atmosphere was much better then the doughnuts."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I am going to say right from the start...the love and obsession with Voodoo Doughnuts is lost on me. And don't get me wrong...I love doughnuts. I've eaten a lot of them over the years, as my waistline will attest. I've also eaten them in multiple states and in multiple countries. But...I am a Portlander...born and raised. Alas I never discovered Voodoo when it was a little, small bakery. I found it after the behemoth it has become today. Maybe, as some have attested, it was a great shop back in the day. I can only judge it by the experience I had now.\\n\\nI come from doughnut loving parents. I, for a time, lived next to a donut shop owned by a little old lady from Guam. It was a little hole in the wall, but her donut bakery made some amazing old school donuts. He would allow me to pop in just after he filled the case and grab a few. Oh those maple bars, old fashioned...the list goes on. Yummy. They were so good they even survived a Krispy Kreme opening literally across the street. \\n\\nOne night my parents and I decided to venture downtown, late, and try Voodoo. The line wasn't too bad...and we ordered up a pink box filled with a dozen of the various kinds they had so we could sample all the creatively topped treats. The first thing that burned in my memory of my first experience there...the staff were less than friendly. Now perhaps this is part of the whole \\"punk\\" vibe the place goes for...but honestly...there is no place for unfriendly or poor customer service E V E R in a public facing business. This attitude extended to even the person's placement of our donuts in the box. Normally one carefully arranged and places the donuts so they don't get mashed or messed up. You'd think this would be even more so important for a place known for his toppings. Well our donuts were basically just tossed in the box....so much so they were a damn mess when we got them home. And no, I was careful with the box...they are donuts, its sacrilege not to be. ;-)\\n\\nOnce home we went into sampling what we got. Now, like most situations, when something is great it can overshadow waiting or poor service or many things. But when you venture through all that and the end result makes you go \\"WTF?\\" It really makes the whole thing sink. First, I have to say...before you go all nuts on your toppings, designs, etc....you have to have a solid foundation...in this case a solid donut. To me Voodoo fails at this necessary principle. The donuts themselves were old and stale. Like we were subjected to day or two old donuts. No amount of toppings were going to change that. Out of 12 offerings I cannot tell you a single one that was memorable. Not 1. And everyone involved in this adventure felt the exact same way. The toppings should be enhancing an already great donut. Yet in this case, it seems it's all novelty and no substance. In some ways it felt like the toppings were masking a lousy donut. \\n\\nFortunately I discovered a true gem of the area long after my unpleasant experience at Voodoo. A true NW hole in the wall donut shop in Vancouver called Donut Nook. The place looks like you have time travelled when you walk in...but it's funky and inviting. The staff warm and friendly. And the donuts? Well that's the best part. While you won't get Captain Crunch mashed on them or one shaped like a penis with cough syrup drenched on top....you will get some fresh...amazingly flavor-filled donuts here. Ones we easily go back to and talk about all the time.\\n\\nSkip the line...there are much better donuts to be had than Voodo"},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Definitely the best Peruvian food in all of Portland.

I would have thought that it was more popular than that. Not like Scarlet & Grey Cafe is the place to be, but a lot of local bands play here and it seems to be popular enough with the student crowd.\\n\\nBut then again maybe not. Scarlet & Grey Cafe charges a cover. At least it does on the nights when there is some live music going on, which I believe is most of the time. I don't really think this place would be worth checking out unless you were here to watch a live band.\\n\\nScarlet & Grey Cafe is right on High St. at the end of Norwich just north of the OSU campus. I used to live on Norwich, so it was an easy half a block walk from my house. I've only been here when I lived in the area and could walk. If you had to park, you might be able to find a spot in front on the street, but you might be better off searching for one on streets like Norwich or Northwood. \\n\\nI'll talk about the last time I was here. Our friends were playing a show, so a bunch of us came to the show. The local bands that play here have to get so many people in the door in order to get paid. The cover is usually only $5, but I think the band can set the price as they see fit. So there were some other people here, but most of the crowd was my friends. It made for a good turn out. I'll pause by mentioning that this is a big hippie hangout. Every time I come here the place fills up with more and more people with dreads and that smell of patchouli as the night goes on. But it's cool, because everyone is friendly and it's usually a really mellow crowd that shows a lot of love to the people on stage, even if they don't know the band.\\n\\nWhile our friends were performing on stage, we enjoyed listening to them while sitting down and relaxing at a table. They do have a few tables and chairs here and there, but the main floor area is cleared off so some people will make that into a dance floor. By the end of the night we were doing a little dancing as well. You would think that with a name like Scarlet and Grey Cafe, this place would be all decked out in OSU stuff, but it's really not. There is some OSU stuff here and there, but it's nothing overwhelming. This place is looking like it's in need of some remodeling. It's not too bad, but it's looking pretty aged. There's an old ugly carpet covering most of the floor and it kinda smells a little funky in here. The bar is towards the back and I remember that the floor over there is tiled. The bar is pretty long and if you go to the one end, there's almost like a little window where you can order your drinks. OK, it's not a window, but it's not as open as the rest of the bar. I've always found it to be really dark in here at night. Not a lot of lighting. I guess they leave that for the stage. The bathrooms aren't too bad, but I found them to be a little questionable. There are two pool tables as well.\\n\\nIt makes for a nice enough hangout, but it's a little expensive for my taste. Since I've only been here for shows at night, I've never been here for happy hour. And the regular drink prices aren't anything to get excited about. In fact, the last time our friends played we all spent so much money on alcohol it was ridiculous. But they do make some good shots here. They were making really big, strong shots for all of us, and I guess that's why it got so expensive. The beers weren't all that cheap though either. We bought a bucket of beers and it was not cheap, but I can't remember how much. I should mention that it was a Friday night, so we weren't expecting great deals.\\n\\nThe service was pretty good and they were really speedy at noticing you and getting your drink. Here's an interesting story about one time I was here to watch my friend's band play. I was up at the little bar window ordering drinks. I had just gotten my drink and turned around and there was this girl standing there. She said, \\"Um, we just wanted to let you know that you can come join us if you want. We'd love to buy you a drink.\\" I looked past her and saw her gesturing to a table with two other girls and one guy. Hmmm.... I told her thank you and that I might, but went to give my boyfriend his drink. We noticed all night that these guys were staring at me weird...turns out they liked me and wanted me to join them for a little private party after the bar. Wow, crazy! I felt bad, but that just wasn't my style. But I guess some crazy things can happen here.\\n\\nThis is a fun place to go to see a live show, especially if you happen to know or know of the band. We always had a great time, but just remember to watch your tab. It can grow exponentially. But it's a fun little joint to sit and listen, or get crazy and dance. There's definitely a vibe of anything goes here. And you don't even have to be a hippie to fit in. I should also tell you that they have a really good beer selection here. I almost forgot about that.

As with all must see and eat icons in cities around the US, over time they grow old good help gets harder to find and the quality of the food and service loses it luster until all that is left is a faint glimpse of what people remember. The clientele that continues to  go there are accustomed to the mediocrity of the food. Places like the Mary Mac Tea Room should be the best of what Atlanta and Southern eats is all about. Instead you are left wondering what it is your missing, what is it people see in this place???\\nYes it was quaint and the eight foot bar made a nice Peach Martine but after that it was all down hill. We ordered the Shrimp and Oyster appetizer which was 9.95. We got charged for a Shrimp Appetizer and an Oyster appetizer 9.95 each ( the ol' bait and switch) and we just kept coasting. My Country Fried Steak was two cold small cutlets smothered and covered in a cold brown gravy.... What happened to White Gravy and I wasn't even asked if I wanted brown or white gravy. I asked for a Loaded Baked Potato with extra butter...I know this because you have to write down what you want to order on a piece of paper like the sushi bar. Which I thought was quaint but now I know why. Well, the baked potato was warm with no butter, no sour cream - only bacon and cheese. Even after I reminded the waitress for some butter- we waited and it never came. My daughter and wife's chicken was Luke warm. \\n\\nThe only hot things we had here was the fried shrimp and oyster that we were over billed for oh and the Mac And Cheese. \\nMy wife had asked for Lemon for her tea and that never showed up either.\\n\\nLastly, the dessert was coming- what is more southern than Peach Cobbler, surely they couldn't screw that up... But yes they did. It wasn't homemade at all- they were canned Peaches. Thankfully, we only ordered one which made it around the table and was hardly touched when it got back to me. It was so sad. I've had better in Golden Corral to be honest.\\n\\nThe only reason I didn't call the manager over is because it was my daughters birthday and I didn't want to cause a scene. It was the worst $106.00 meal I've had in the Forth Ward. Listen to me Expect mediocre and you won't be let down at Mary Mac. Total disappointment for us. As they say in the South - God Bless their little hearts at Mary Mac's.\\n\\nSo here is my recommendation if you think Mary Mac's is good that's fine but do not bring out of state guest here because they will be as confused as I am and won't have the nerve to tell you."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I came here for Valentine's Day with my girlfriend, and wanted to make sure I found a nice spot with a warm atmosphere.

We were unceremoniously ushered to the hostess table where we inquired about our reservation. We happened to be about 10 minutes early, so we were told we would have to wait. So we walked over to the bar, brushing elbows with the fellow patrons and avoiding the seemingly unlimited number of servers as they rushed down the narrow walkways to deliver their trays. It was quite clear that the reputation for Andina was widely known, so in anticipation for the amazing food we were about to enjoy, we decided to overlook the borderline rude reception and wait for our table at the bar, maybe get a nice cocktail to sip on. As we stood by the crowded bar, trying to get the bartender's attention, a server bustled over to us with a slightly annoyed look and asked us to please wait by the door, and that bar service was by reservation only. After about 5 minutes of waiting awkwardly by the entrance, we felt so completely in the way that we decided to just wait outside in the cold. When we went in to be seated, we were told the table was still not ready, but something had opened up in the bar area. So, being famished at this point, we took them up on the offer to have us seated at the bar. \\nWe decided to get in the spirit of things with a round of Peruvian beer to start with, they were both completely forgettable. Our small plates arrived shortly afterwords, PALTA RELLENA DE CANGREJO (avocado stuffed with crab, topped with a poached prawn ) for her, and an order of CONCHAS A LA PARRILLA (grilled diver scallops with a tamari-brown sugar butter sauce and crispy onions) for me. I enjoyed my scallops immensely, very savory. My date, however, found her dish a little heavy handed on the avocado, and not as much crab as she hoped. \\nBefore our entrees arrived, we decided to order a GOLPE DE ESTADO (a 100% cacaolicuado de chocolate (chocolate milkshake) spiked with a pre-Columbian spiced rum (vanilla, smoked peppers and allspice), topped with a tres leches whipped cream ) to share. That was by far the best experience during our meal, as the delicious alcoholic chocolate shake was to die for. \\nOur entrees were served shortly after, AT√öN CON TACU TACU Y AGUAYMANTO (seared yellowfin tuna sprinkled with black pepper and orange zest, served with traditional lima bean tacu tacu, orange wedges, endive spears and salsa criolla, drizzled with a cape gooseberry-aj√≠ amarillo sauce) for the lady, and BISTEC NOVOANDINO (seasoned Cascade Natural filet mignon, grilled to order, topped with a King-oyster mushroom salsa criolla and black beer sauce, accompanied by a traditional humita and a saut√© of fingerling potatoes, fris√©e and achiote oil) for me. \\nThe dishes were delightfully arranged, and if the restaurant lighting wasn't so dim, the display would have been quite Instagram worthy. My filet mignon was delectable, perfectly seasoned, and the creamy oyster-mushroom sauce complimented the dish magnificently. Unfortunately for my date, her dish was quite heavily seasoned and was a tad bit too spicy for her to enjoy, but she had to admit the tuna was seared to perfection, and rivaled some of her own favorite tuna dishes from her home country of Japan. \\nAll in all, we found the vibe to be quite hectic, and conversation was difficult with all the din and a live musical performance, sadly playing on deaf ears as the raucous of the bar area was quite overwhelming. The service was swift, and the orders were executed with complete accuracy, and most of the food was delicious. I'd rate this restaurant experience with a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and I will admit, that .5th of a star is entirely owed to the exquisite GOLPE DE ESTADO."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The manager Leslie saw I was standing next to the bar waiting for a table during ACL week while my two guests had bar chairs.

Turns out, my hunch was pretty dead-on.  Longhorn Steakhouse is, both inside and out, almost identical to TL&C.  If you're not in to lots of faux Texas-y kitch adorning the walls and ceilings, please be aware.\\n \\n(I should also note that this restaurant is not yet officially open. My wife and I were shopping in Sunset Valley and, as odd as it may sound, were approached in the parking lot by the restaurant manager with an invitation to dine there for free that evening.  This was a sort of \\"friends and family event\\" pre-soft opening, so my experience might not equal yours.) \\n\\nOn to the food.  I ordered a ribeye medium well and it was magnificently cooked. Great salt and pepper seasoning with a nice pan sear on both sides.  My wife, on the other hand, ordered a filet and had problems getting her steak cooked properly--even after sending it back to the kitchen.  \\n\\nTwo thoughts about this:  1) If you're dining at a family-friendly steakhouse, there's a very good chance the cooks aren't that experienced and will have difficultly cooking your steak exactly the way it should.  As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. 2) Again, this was a comped meal at a pre-opening event, so that sort of thing has to be taken in to consideration.\\n\\nThe only other small mark on this dining experience was that it took our server multiple attempts to bring a cocktail we ordered to our table shortly after arrival.  Otherwise, he did a fantastic job--very friendly, checked with us often, etc.  \\n\\nOverall, I think we were both quite impressed with the food and service.  Yes, there are some kinks to work out here and there, but that's pretty natural for any new restaurant.  I do think the food is a slight nudge better than TL&C, and the portions (if you can believe it), a bit bigger too.

There are mirrors that line two of the four walls with one solid wall.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately in one of the little booths.  We skipped the \\"special\\" for the evening, which kind of put our waiter off.  Fortunately, he got over it by the time we were done.  We had the Mulligatawny Soup ($2) to start, which is a soup made with orange lentils with tomato, citrus juice and spices.  It was delicious - the soup had been cooked down until the lentils broke down and everything was integrated wonderfully.  It is a very mild soup, but it was very flavorful and I loved the freshness that the citrus delivered.\\n\\nFor dinner, we shared Dharosh Bhaaji ($9), which is okra saut√©ed with tomatoes, onions and spices.  We also shared the Shaag Maang-sho, which is chicken saut√©ed with paalong shaag (chopped spinach), onions, tomatoes, black cumin seeds and other spices.  We had ordered both of the dishes medium spicy, and they were pretty mild.  Fortunately, the okra had a little heat, but the saag was not spicy at all.  Despite that, both dishes were delish.  The saag was some of the best that I have ever had - and this is the dish that I always order.  The white meat chicken in it was a bit dry, but that is typical (which is why I typically order it without the chicken, which just takes up space in the dish).  A large plate of plain rice also came with our food - I skip it.  We also ordered a plain naan - it was pretty doughy (if y'all have Trader Joe's, they have better naan in their freezer section).  It didn't stop me from eating it, but that's because I skip the rice.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend Panahar Bangladeshi to anyone.  Stick to the delicious soup and entrees and skip the filler."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Lured in by the charm of an old converted school, our trip from beginning to end was disappointment after disappointment. \\n\\n1) The wait for a table was quoted at 10-15 minutes.

The locals are more open to conversation, since the wait is about an hour during the morning. Once you (finally) enter the restaurant, you have more than enough time to decide what you'll order; you can also see what others are enjoying to help you figure out whether the French Toast is appetizing enough. I decided on the Banana and Caramel French Toast, which is the BEST French Toast I've ever had; the bananas are freshly sliced, the caramel is sugary enough and really adds flavor to the toast, which is soft. The orange juice is also delicious. What impressed me most was the ability of the employees to fit everyone in the restaurant and make sure everyone has a seat available.

However, there were certain aspects of our night that did not meet my expectations.\\n\\nFor example, despite having a reservation in the dining room with the band, we were seated  in the wrong room after a 15 minute wait. We were accommodated for after asking to be moved. We received appetizers with not plates, until I fetched them myself from the bar.  The b√©arnaise sauce came cold & I had no shell discard plate for my cioppino & our white wine sat on the table for about 30 minutes before it was put in an ice bucket. While I understand how these could be perceived as small things, these are the things I feel really matter in an upscale place. \\n\\nThat said, our waitress Katie, if I remember her name correctly, (she is half Brazilian & half Irish) was great. She apologized & did the best to help with everything going on- I can't compliment her enough.\\n\\nI really hope you can respect me sending this email in lieu of writing a review on yelp, and I hope these things are addressed.

So, be sure to review the menu and ask questions.  I was unable to purchase many of the items due to the cane sugar and yeast (I don't eat these), but I did walk away with a loaf of the C.R.A.W.  Bread.  Just thinking about it as I write this blog makes me want to have a slice!  Though the bread has a hint of brown sugar  (about a tablespoon I was told), it is so little in comparison to the volume that it is almost negligible.\\n\\nThere is no where to sit, it is a pick-up only location.

Our waitress was extremely friendly and the polar opposite of the chilly hostess, but a little less than attentive.  For being popular with tourists, I had figured they would be trying hard to turn tables, but we ended up having a very slow-paced lunch.\\n\\nI found the food to be good.  The scrod (breadcrumb-crusted cod) was perfectly cooked and a decent size.  My other half was a big fan of the cod sandwich.  The $7 clam chowder was insanely delicious but one of the smallest cups I've ever seen.  The complimentary cornbread was served hot and was a lovely complement to the meal.  For dessert, we shared the Indian pudding because it sounded like something we wouldn't find anyplace else, and it was a reasonably tasty gingerbread-soup-sort-of-thing topped with whipped cream.\\n\\nOverall, I think that given the history, old world charm, pretty good food, and reasonably decent prices, the Union Oyster House is worth a visit."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Choose any three items on the menu for $45.

Had lunch here today & was a little mixed in my opinion. The shrimp loaf (po-boy) was tasty. It had 4 or 5 lightly fried, decent-size shrimp on it. However, for the size of the roll, I would have expected a couple more shrimp on there. A lot of the roll just contained lettuce, tomato & sauce. The shoestring fries that came with it were lukewarm at best and a tad overcooked. I ate maybe 4-5 sticks & left the rest of the large mound. I was kinda surprised that the server didn't inquire as to why I left them all on the plate.\\n\\nI also had the she-crab soup. It was okay. Decent flavor, but the sherry was a little overpowering. And if there were any actual pieces of crab in the soup, they were miniscule.  We did try the hushpuppies and they were very tasty. I'd order those again in a heartbeat. They were both savory & sweet due to the powdered sugar served on top.\\n\\nMy coworkers were both very pleased with their entree selections. One had the lobster salad and the other had the blackened fish sandwich with a side of brussels sprouts.\\n\\nOur server was good.

There was some weird chicken in a brownish sauce, I have no idea what it was but I though it was pretty good. The rice wasn't anything special and the beans were good, they had some sausage in them and a nice smokey flavor. \\n\\nMost of the meat was absolutely delicious. It was cooked perfectly for the most part (if you want to eat well done shoe leather don't come here) and they weren't shy about coming over to the table.

For starters, if this is your first time at this colorful establishment the servers give you a taste of all their sides for free. Now that's excellent customer service and a good way to setup the palate. While your inhaling the goodness of Peruvian food the servers explain the menu and its choices. This helps the customer because by the time you finish your sample you want to order everything. Once you show some restraint you realize you came in to eat their wonderful smelling chicken. Open fire rotisserie roasted chicken can only mean one good thing and that's utter heaven with a Latin American twist. So after you wipe the saliva running down your mouth to your chin, you order the size of chicken (1/4, 1/2, or whole). They cut the chicken up for you so it's easier to in-hale without choking and then you can either eat the goodness at the restaurant or take it home. If your eating in  the your in for a treat because they have wonderful Inca decor and the typical standard now a days; 4, 60\\" flat screen boob tubes to help you breath in- between in-hales of yumminess. I think I've given you a little bit if a picture of what to expect when you go to Inka Chicken.

Standing there, it reminded me of a chinese bakery where the fruitcakes just sit in the center of the store between the cashiers and spin in circles. The donuts were doing the exactly same thing, on a platter spinning and spinning. The decor was pink inside that screamed look at me and give yourself a headache. \\n\\nI was really thrown off by the LACK of service here. There were no signs as to what they offered, or what each of the donuts on display was. The girl helping us was in no mood to and we were just trying to find out what's good in the hood. We asked for their \\"famous\\" donut and she suggested the Maple Bacon- and so we did. Not impressed because I don't care for donuts like that, bacon was dried and fried to an ashy crisp, and the donut wasn't even fluffy on the inside. \\n\\nThe hype lacked realness and it's really for the pictures.

I ate my fill, but didn't save the leftovers.\\n\\nVeggies were crisp-tender, good deal. Mushrooms were big and juicy, yum!

Had the restaurant week lunch today, sweet potato soup, salmon with tomatillo and cappuccino mousse with a red Zinfandel.  My friend had the salad and salmon and creme Brule.  The salad was creative, had an appropriate coating of dressing and was fairly large.  My soup was piping hot with a dab of butter on top and large as well.  The chef accommodated my friends shrimp allergy and removed any shrimp crust that would have been on her salmon so she could eat (and not die), which is thoughtful especially on a prix fixe menu.  Top of the Hub cooks an amazing piece of fish, DO order fish regularly.  We went on a cloudy day so there was no real view but the white light of the clouds lights everyone's face with the stark white linen in a refreshing way.  Wine list is ok, but expect to pay at least $10 a glass for anything.  Service is nice and attentive and seems to care if you are happy or not.  Only draw backs are that the correct elevator to get up to the top is a little bit of a maze to get to if you don't know the building or the city.  The bar has totally been done over and now they have a cute \\"lounge\\" area with a separate menu ($24 minimum) that opens around 8pm every night.

This is my story:\\n\\nHad 5:30 dinner reservations on Saturday, March 17th for four. We came into the city around 2pm to have some beers at a few Irish pubs with a couple visiting us from upstate NY. Well that didn't happen once we saw the lines to get into anywhere that served booze were about 50-100 people long. We never stood a chance- St. Patrick's Day on a sunny 60 degree Saturday with the Bruins in town? Forget about it.\\n\\nSomehow managed to grab one seat at the bar at Hillstones, and we camped out there for about 2 hours drinking Sam Adams and munching on french fries. Left to walk around Faneuil Hall area to see the Irish Step Dancing, then decided to try to grab a seat at the Union Oyster House bar for one more drink before dinner. The line to get into their main bar downstairs was wrapped around the building, but since we had reservation, we went in through the main dining room and walked right back into the bar and took a seat. Awesome. Within about 20 minutes they asked us if we wanted to be seated early, so up to the third floor we went.\\n\\nThe place itself is obviously very old, but not in a gross or tacky way. The history of the building and restaurant is printed on their menu, and it's quite interesting. The vibe is warm and cozy, not too cramped. Our server was a charming older lady from South Boston who get props for graciously listening to us bitch about their ridiculous alcohol policies. No doubles, no more than one drink in front of you at a time, no shots (in the dining room at least.)\\n\\nThe food was pretty good but nothing to consider authentic or special. They do start you off with warm hunks of cornbread that were delicious. I ordered the chowder which they proclaim to be famous, but to me was totally generic and served lukewarm. BOO. Between the four of us we split fried calamari (YUM), the broiled seafood platter (not a huge amount of food for a \\"platter\\" and the white fish was a tad overcooked) and native raw oysters on the half shell. Although our server couldn't remember where our oysters came from, they were pretty good. They also weren't fully disconnected from the lower shell. Kinda weird when you're restaurant is called an oyster house. Prices were pretty high, but that's to be expected for a restaurant in this area.\\n\\nAfterwards we went back down to the main bar area for a few more drinks, since we knew there wasn't a chance in hell of  getting into another bar. We were able to grab 2 seats, and stayed there for about 2 more hours. The place was packed to capacity by the time we left, but it was a fun environment nonetheless. The bartenders were really busting ass, and considering the amount of drunk girls waving twenties at them from every direction, they were getting drinks out FAST. Props to them. \\n\\nOk I've gotta share this little story with you. The four of us are down at the main bar having a great time (we are 2 married couples). At one point our friend leaves her husband to find the restrooms. While she's gone, her husband is approached by a pretty young thing who is clearly DTF. My happily married friend is playing it off innocently enough, not leading her on, just finding amusement from the situation in general. The girl takes our her phone to get his # when his wife comes up from behind her and asks \\"I'm sorry am I interrupting something?\\" Of course the poor girl is mortified and immediately turns back to her group of friends behind us. Extremely awkward, right? Well it was even more awkward when 30 minutes later we hear a beer bottle drop and people start cheering and crying, because that girl has just been proposed to by her boyfriend- on St. Patrick's Day, in the middle of a crowded bar, with an emerald engagement ring.

If I order a burrito, I'd like more than just trace elements of meat in my food. I shouldn't have to test my burrito for trace elements of meat because of the lack thereof. If I order EXTRA meat, that doesn't mean out the same disappointing amount into my food as you usually do.

They've got two solid veggie options for my veg-eaters, so we got half mushroom and half margherita. The meat pizza was half armadillo and half ooh la la. My friends loved the Armadillo, so that seemed to be the meat winner. It had sausage, ricotta and jalapenos. Out of the veggies, I would go with the shroom. We all agreed that was the best with the arugula, mushrooms, and goat cheese. WHOOT 1 point for veg! Next time I'm back, I'm getting the mushroom pizza again. THAT good. The menus are all SUPER easy to read, and the staff is so patient and courteous even as we stood there mouths open trying to take in all of the pizza (and other food) options.

I had wandered into the restaurant while taking pictures in the warehouse district. Seeing that me and my girlfriend had cameras, the manager brought us free cortados with beautiful latte art by their talented barista to photograph. During every other visit the manager (and owner?) always stops by the table to make sure we're enjoying our dining experience and is willing to pull up a chair and chat for a few minutes. It seems like his openness has rubbed off on his entire staff. Everyone is always extremely helpful and ready to take the extra step to answer any questions or do anything for the customers. \\n\\nBeyond the friendly staff, the food was also excellent. Their hot dogs and other sausages have always been top-notch, the waffle fries are always served piping-hot, and the beer is, as their website promises, ice-cold.

During this visit, I knew I had to get there for brunch or else I wouldn't have been able to eat here at all! Being from California, I really wanted to experience southern dining and I think Mary Mac helped me experience that. The food was delicious and the restaurant was what I envisioned dining in the south would be like.

You just write down what you want on the ordering sheet so need trying to memorize and rehearse your order (;\\n\\nTo start off, we were given the pot likker (a cup of broth that came from collard greens and other goodness), cornbread with pieces of pig skin or fat, and an assortment of warm rolls, cinnamon bread, and more cornbread! I love me some warm and fluffy bread! As for the entree, I got to try the chicken fried chicken and the chicken pot pie. Each entree comes with two sides so I tried the dumplings, fried green tomatoes, cornbread stuffing, and whipped potatoes. Everything was amazing but my favorite sides were the dumplings and cornbread stuffing with gravy.... yumm! I also ordered dessert (peach cobbler) which was a mistake because I was way too full to enjoy it.

We needed to catch a bus to NYC in 30 minutes, so we quickly ordered a couple bowls of clam chowder and oysters. The clam chowder tasted just like canned Campbell's soup but a little more watery with very few seafood chunks, and the oysters were decent, albeit carelessly cleaned (found sand in a few). The best part of the meal was the huge block (at least 3 inches tall & wide) of delicious cornbread they gave each of us.\\n\\nI personally would not come back, but if you plan to make a trip here, expect to enjoy the history (\\"oldest restaurant in Boston,\\" since 1826) and tourist bits more than the food or service."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went here for my birthday dinner last week and it perfectly satisfied my wish for casual gourmet dining.

Service was a little spotty, but generally available and helpful.  Cocktails were good (I had a strawberry basil punch and the Old Salty Dog), and the wine list was surprisingly accessible.  For apps, we had oysters (yum), the fried crab roll (really tasty), and the \\"angels on horseback\\" (parents loved, but for me, at a seafood place, you can keep the pork belly).  We had four different kinds of fish for entrees - tile fish, skate, grouper, and halibut - and everything was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The pickled ramps with the tile fish and the sauce with the halibut were particularly notable.  We got shoestring fries, gnocchi, and carrots for sides, and they were all very good - the fries come in a HUGE portion, but somehow they disappeared (along with the tasty malt vinegar aioli they came with).  Desserts were a disappointment all around - the only thing keeping The Optimist from a 5-star review.  We tried the chocolate \\"pop tart,\\" the blueberry pie, the grilled pound cake, and the grapefruit tart.  I didn't try the pound cake, but everything else left me cold - they were technically perfect (for example, the crusts/pastries on everything had wonderful texture), and they were presented beautifully, but there wasn't a whole lot of flavor to speak of.  The grapefruit tart, for instance, didn't taste like grapefruit unless you actually landed on a piece of the candied grapefruit garnish.

So i did. My experience was relegated to horrible. \\n\\nThe first thing you notice when walking in is that this place is old and dungy. It doesn't look clean and the lighting is horrible. The customer service there is horrendous. They yelled at our group for standing in front of the door. If they don't want people standing in front of the door of a cramped \\n and overcrowded area they should set up line barriers to prevent this from happening. Yelling at customers doesn't really make the experience enjoyable. \\n\\nWhen we were called up to make our order we were met by a guy that was dressed very funky and was tattooed all over. I mean on his face, arms, and anything that was visible. I honestly was intrigued by all his tattooes. He had these knuckles tattoos with a line in between each knuckle followed by dots between the other knuckles on each finger. I had never seen that before so i asked what it meant. He looked at me and said \\"you don't know!?\\" to which i shook my head to indicate that i did not. He then said very rudely, \\"if you don't know then you will never know!\\" and walked away in disgust. He said it with such anger i was left there staring at the ugly pink walls of the shop in disbelief of what just happened. It was an eerie feeling being there to begin with and now it was a bad experience that kept turning worse. \\n\\nNow, i was hoping the doughnuts would redeem the bad experience. I tried the bacon maple doughnut. The doughnut tasted old and the bacon was dry and lacked flavor. To top it all off it wasn't reasonably priced either. \\n\\nThen what sealed the deal was that our group decided to eat our doughnuts a block away from the shop standing on the sidewalk. While eating them,  there was a man in his late 20s or early 30s standing about 5 feet away from us. We didn't think anything of it. He tried to make small talk with us but we kept to ourselves. A minute later we see him shooting up some heroin right in front of us. This was in the late afternoon and in public. \\n\\nOverall, I would give this entire experience 0 stars if it were possible.

These better be worth it was all I was thinking...\\n\\nWell they are tasty, the flavors are unique, and the vibe is definitely fun inside the store.  The line moved at a reasonable pace and the kids were happy to pick a cotton candy doughnut, a Portland cream, a voodoo doll, The Loop, and a powdered doughnut.  The employees were kind but moved at a brisk pace to keep the line moving.  We took a few minutes to choose and the cashier was very patient with our indecision.  The doughnuts we ordered were fresh and tasty!   I liked the raspberry and chocolate combo in the voodoo doll, the kids loved their flavors, but dad didn't like the Portland cream (my hubby is not a sugar fiend like the rest of us).  All in all, we were happy to experience Voodoo Doughnuts and it was the highlight of our visit to the city of Portland other than OMSI and walking over the Tilikum Bridge.\\n\\nOne caveat is that the main location of Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland is on a rough street with many homeless doing some crazy things just down the block.

In fairness we were handed a $50 gift card when seated (a half hour late at 7:30 I might add) however because I was handed the $50 gift card AFTER we were seated I was unable to use it towards the $35 bar tab we incurred during the half hour we were waiting to be seated. Ok seated... Ordered iceberg wedge and scallops as an appetizer. Wedge was DROWNED in dressing, soggy and to the point of being inedible. Scallops were good, presentation nice but 2 scallops for $12... Seriously?? On to the entrees, she ordered the filet... Excellent. I ordered the 28 day aged rib eye, also excellent cooked perfectly. The sides (creamed spinach & saut√©ed mushrooms) both lukewarm and late arriving (approx 3-5 mins after the entrees were delivered). Service was slow. At one point we had to ask a manager who happened to be standing nearby to refill our water glasses. Each time we ordered drinks we had to wait an inordinate amount of time for them to be delivered. She ordered a mixed drink that was so weak I ordered a shot of liquor straight up which I then proceeded to pour into her drink. I was drinking bottled beer kinda tough to screw that up, except for the server walking over and simply placing the beer bottle on the table with a fresh glass (not pouring it as every other server and bartender had done previously) and then ignoring the empty beer bottle which sat on the table for the duration of the meal. On to dessert. I ordered a coffee and a shot of liqueur, she ordered an expresso martini and we decided to split a creme br√ªl√©e. Coffee arrived promptly. Waited again an inordinate amount of time for the drinks. Finally got them. Her martini was weak and \\"the worst I have ever had\\" after approx 15 mins during which time she finished her martini & I finished my coffee...... Dessert was delivered.

The pizzas run between $9-$15ish and are enough to fill up one person or for two people to split as long as they're ordering other appetizers and dessert.\\n\\nBackspace has a long bar that sits directly in front of the pizza oven so you can watch all the action and a few tables along the street side window, but once it gets discovered, this place is likely to fill up quickly, so get there early.\\n\\nI tried four of the eight pizzas available, and they were all delicious.  My favorite was the fennel sausage with roasted red peppers.  They don't have a \\"build your own option\\" here, but they do have a few interesting toppings including anchovies and farm fresh eggs that you can add to any of their pizzas. \\n\\nThe crust on these pizzas is amazing and unlike any other crust in Austin that I've tried.  It's bubbly and crisp in places with just the right amount of chewiness.\\n\\nThe wine list is filled with Italian wines which start at $7.50 a class or $28 a bottle and head up from there.  \\n\\nEven though I think Parkside has stumbled on something great here, there is still some room for improvement:\\n\\n-  The pizzas were all a little too salty.  I'm not sure where the saltiness was coming from, but since it was consistant across the pizzas, it must have been the sauce or the dough.\\n\\n- On the fennel sausage and pepperoni pizzas, the crust was too thin in the middle to hold the toppings and it dissolved into a bit of nothingness in the very center of the pizza.\\n\\n-  The appetizers were good, but the portions were a bit too small.  For instance, the meatballs app came with three meatballs which makes splitting it difficult so upping this to four would be a good solution.  Also, it would be nice to get bread with the meatballs app for dipping.\\n\\n- Since Backspace is attempting to emulate a true Italian pizza restaurant, it would be nice if they added a cheap house Italian red at about $5 a glass/$20 a bottle.\\n\\nOtherwise, this place is fantastic, and I suggest going now before everyone else figures it out."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of the best fried chicken I've ever had!

Three of us arrived about 1PM on a Sunday so we had a choice between brunch and lunch menu... we chose lunch menu.. \\n We began with Spinach-Artichoke Dip, two of us are crazy in love with S-A dip but this was a bland, disappointing version; too much cream cheese maybe? The grilled pitas that accompanied it were the highlight of the entire meal, no lie.\\nOne of us ordered the Cuban Panini and the other two people chose burgers... The panini was a glorified grilled cheese with boiled ham, unlike other Cubanos we've tried. A big let down. The burgers were adequate, nothing more. They aren't charcoal broiled, so be forewarned, if you prefer your burger charcoal broiled, order something else. They were served on toasted onion rolls, a plus, I suppose.. Also, the service was great; pleasant, efficient, fast.\\nThere seemed to be a steady stream for take out, so Cafe 47 definitely has its fans but not us, I wouldn't go back. it's not terrible but all three of us were disappointed with our meal and that's a rare thing indeed.

Their curries are really quite good considering how they need to be produced in very large batches.

While lines can get annoying when this place is crowded, it does ensure that you generally wind up getting the freshest batches of food possible. The naan is especially good then if you could get your hands on some (Naan almost always disappears as soon as it arrives)\\n\\nIf you are going for All you can eat, it would be wise to go for lunch rather than dinner, as it is cheaper for lunch, and they will provide refreshment such as chai and nectar, whereas they don't for dinner.\\nIf sweet beverages aren't your thing, this place also serves beer at some pretty generous prices (i.e. generous to you- the beer is quite cheap)\\n\\nFor what you're paying for, this place gives you quite a deal.

What a wonderful evening/ dinner. \\n\\nWhen most restaurants  list a surprise on the menu they have the wait staff describe the day's surprise.  Alana's is definitely not most restaurants, and I mean that in a good way.  Our waiter explained that he wouldn't know what the surprise was until he brought it out and that Alana would change it every few orders.  We went back to perusing our menus and contemplating options.\\n\\nWe decided to order drinks and share two appetizers.  A trio of Ohio cheeses was an easy choice, but what to do for our second shared appetizer? We concluded that a vegan surprise appetizer would undoubtedly be something hubby (lactose intolerant but otherwise very tolerant) could share.  A few minutes later our wine and beer arrived followed by a trio of cheeses and .....slivered green beans atop some delicately flavored creamed corn (vegan) and some other yummy things that I don't quite recall.\\n\\nEmboldened by the delightful appetizer surprise I decided on the \\"vegetarian surprise\\" for my entree.  I had been contemplating a salmon dish that our friends did order.  Hubby ordered a lamb chops entree that came with a variety of Mediterranean dips. He reminded our waiter about the no dairy requirement and we happily awaited our meal.\\n\\nA few warnings.  I don't see these as downsides because we knew what we were getting into and were quite happy about it but a first timer might not.  The pace was leisurely; Alana's is not about turning tables over, it's about the food!  The atmosphere is eclectic. One might describe it as part gallery part bohemian apartment.  It was a bit warm; yes they had air conditioning but you did not feel as if you were in a meat locker.\\n\\nOK back to the food!  My \\"surprise\\" was a deliciously creamy zucchini and almond risotto.   It was very rich, and I'll be eating half for lunch today.  Hubby's lamb chops were beautifully presented with a variety of sides.  Usually when restaurants remove an offending dairy item they either fill in with more potatoes or rice.  Not Alana's!  The chef substituted the feta dip with a beautifully roasted vegetable medley.  The salmon dishes looked good too.   \\n\\nBy the time we had finished our entrees we probably should have said \\"enough\\" but we were enjoying the eclectic food (and company) too much to stop! On to desserts.  There were a few desserts that looked interesting, particularly a creme br√ªl√©e but the surprise factor was too much fun.  Two of us ordered the \\"not so austere surprise\\" and one ordered the \\"austere surprise,\\" hubby was too stuffed to order anything more.  Three different desserts arrived!  None looked very austere!  They were:  a chocolate cake with a raspberry sauce and whipped cream, a peanut butter and banana cream pie and a lemonny ice cream atop shaved cantaloupe.  Wow!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Easily the best and most eclectic donuts I've had.

However, the actual sausage I had was pork, bacon, jalapeno, and sage and it was freaking delicious, so I wanted to give them another try based on that alone. \\n\\nLast night's visit redeemed them!  We were seated immediately, even though we had a party of 7.  Our server was fast, friendly, and knew what he was doing.  While the mason jars are really cute they are probably half the size of a regular glass, but that didn't faze our server.  My soda was never empty.  I had a hard time deciding on something from their specials because everything looked so good.  I do feel a little bad getting a dog that's over twice the price of one of their regular dogs, but I think it's an acceptable cost for being able to eat exotic meats.\\n\\nFrank's really shines when it comes to their sausages.

The cooking is supposed to be good, but it cannot be worth the process of it all. My gripes range from the fact that the open kitchen makes the whole tiny place incredibly hot to the fact that the queue snakes back on itself taking over what little open space is available between tables. (This means whether you want to or not, you're standing right at someone else's table while they eat. I don't suppose there is a good table in the whole restaurant because in the winter the tables farthest from the kitchen and queue are in the blast-zone from the opening door.)

I have only had a few doughnuts off their large menu and I have no complaints about any of them so I can only imagine how great the other's are.

Twenty minutes later I got a text message saying our table was ready which was a great surprise. We went back to the restaurant and got promptly seated, but in front of the door. In the summer this would of been fine but since it was about 10 degrees out, the entire right side of the restaurant was wearing their coat while eating because every time someone opened the door a rush of cold air would come in. If they expand they should definitely get rid of the seats in the front because that's not a pleasant way to spend your dinner.\\n\\nThe ramen itself was great. I got the spicy miso ramen (our waiter wisely advised me that it's actually not spicy so if I wanted it to be spicy he could tell the kitchen to make it extra extra spicy which is I did) and my friend got the shoyu ramen which our waiter recommended as his favorite. We got the regular sizes and decided to try the molten egg. I really like that they leave a water bottle on the table for you to fill up your own water.\\nThe food came pretty quickly and it was delicious. The extra extra spicy ended up being the perfect amount of spiciness. The noodle were deliciously chewy and the broth was very fragrant. My only qualm is that they only give you two pieces of pork (mine were very small slices), two mushrooms, and a few toppings. You can pay extra to add more if you want, but I feel for $12 you should get a bit more toppings included. They also forgot our egg but didn't charge us for it so we didn't say anything.

There are seats at both bars but you have to wait for those too - they are not first come, first serve.

We shared the Diavola which had a salame piccante on it for a nice little spice.  I was glad to see that even though the pizza description said San Marzano tomatoes - it was actually sauce and not individual tomato slices. \\n\\nDon't miss: \\nFresh sliced meat plate - prosciutto (which is visible on a slicer when you walk in the door), salami, and mortadella.

Liu in Worthington another shot. I figured, what are the chances that I will have a similar experience? Well... I was mistaken. Let's first focus on the positives: We arrived there earlier in the evening and had found that parking wasn't an issue. In fact, I had ample space to move my large F250 through the parking lot and managed a nice parking spot. However; if it were a busy night, I can foresee myself parking in the grass or something because the parking lot design is still poor. We were immediately seated despite being a little early. Our table was clean and ready for us to begin our dining experience. Here is where the chapters turn. We happen to get the same exact waitress as last time! Still, I thought... what are the chances? She started by taking our drinks, I ordered the Spicy Apple Cider cocktail (very good by the way) and my date ordered a Sprite. During the process of ordering, the waitress interrupted to talk about how much water people were drinking today and began talking negatively about other patrons (about how much water they were drinking). She then left to go grab our drinks. As we waited, we looked around and noticed everyone around us had some delicious looking bread. We both were very hungry, so everything looked appetizing in our eyes. Knowing we were going to order an appetizer, we patiently waited for our waitress. As she returned, she sat our drinks down and began walking away without an acknowledgment. So we caught her before going too far and asked to order the calamari appetizer. About 10 minutes later,she comes back and takes our order. We started to order our food and she quickly stopped us to inform us that they were not offering a \\"couples dinner\\" due to the preparation involved. This was odd as we weren't interested in that, nor did we inquire. I ordered the Risotto and my date ordered the Tilapia with a side of beef tips. As she began to place her order, the waitress abruptly interrupted and told her to wait as she wrote it down. I found this very off putting because it wasn't that we just started ordering, the waitress had her pen and paper in hand. Shortly after our order was placed, the appetizer came out. The calamari had a delicious tempura batter served with a sweet jalapeno sauce. It had an excellent flavor and was an appropriate serving size. After we finished, we looked around  the room again at the delicious bread that others had. still hungry, it looked better and better with each passing moment. During a span of 20-25 minutes, we interacted with our waitress one time. Finally, about 10 minutes before our food came out, she asked us if we would like any bread while we wait. For me, I think this was implied and didn't know why she would ask. It was indeed as delicious as it looked we went  through it too fast (as there were only 4 portions). Our food did arrive fairly timely and it was pretty good. My Risotto was nicely prepared and the scallops were beautifully seared. I wasn't a fan of the raw tomatoes, but each their own. My date enjoyed her Tilapia. It was nicely breaded served with mashed red potatoes and broccoli. She did say that the beef tips were a tad on the bland side, but prepared nicely. \\n\\nOverall, my original review still stands pretty true. Now I will say, if we had different wait staff, our experience could have been better. In fact if I decide to go back and I do get  the same waitress, I will ask to be seated in a different area. The food is pretty good, the ambience was nice but the service kills this location every time."},{"name":"Krua Thai","address":"231 N Main St","city":"Natick","stars":"4.5","text":"We ate here for linner  (4pm) and were very pleasantly surprised by the delicious appetizers Thai ribs and dumplings as well as the entrees red curry chicken and duck choo chee.

Then my son asked him if there was wifi and when there wasn't he offered us his hot spot but we couldn't accept.  Later he came by with an ipad with netflix options for my son but respectfully asked if it was ok. So thoughtful of him!!\\nHe also brought us a bowl of white rice at no extra charge for my son as the food had a little more spice than my son was accustomed.

It seemed as if many other servers had this wonderfully joyful attitude and gratitude to be working there - what a testament to Calvin!\\n\\n2) FOOD - best meal we've had in Atlanta!\\nWe shared the Lobster fried rice and the Prik King Fried Grouper.

It doesn't hurt that the hotel it resides in is gorgeous and has the best lounge on the planet, The Driftwood Room, where you would expect to see Don Draper resting his laurels in one of the very dimly lit booths while sipping a Manhattan.\\n\\nGracie's is charming, handsomely decorated in an old-school classy sort of way (think old Georgian Room at the top of M&F). The waitstaff was extremely attentive and the bartender, Mike, of the Driftwood, was a real treat to chat with while watching him crank out an endless parade of yummy martinis.\\n\\nThe prices of the food were very reasonable and ranged from about $6 up to the $20-30 range. Since the menu consists of small plates (a la carte options), we went with what we believed was a good, overall balance of dishes to try and sample each section on the menu. We started with the bibb lettuce salad, which was beautifully presented by the way. It had a nice crispy piece of bacon atop and great blue cheese dressing without being drowned in it and was really great. We switched gears and went with the pork belly crostini which was so effing amazing, we actuall ordered a second one. \\n\\nFor the main course, we each chose the halibut and smoked salmon respectively and they were both equally wonderful. We split the smaller, daily artichoke risotto, which was a very reasonable portion for $9 and it was the highlight of the dinner. Our stomachs got the better of us and we also split the Gorgonzola Cheesecake which would have been better as a first course or even a dessert. It too was delicious and was a huge portion for the price.\\n\\nOverall, we are incredibly glad we finally made it to Gracie's and wil definitely be back. We will also be frequenting the Driftwood for some of the best cocktails we've ever had - their happy hour runs until 6:30 and while we didn't enjoy any apps there, did note some of them looked quite tasty. With regard to their drinks, ladies will love the Black and Blue made with blackberry puree that I swear tastes like a slice of blackberry pie as well as a drink that tastes exactly like Tiramisu that is not on the drink menu but can be ordered regardless. \\n\\nBon Appetit!"},{"name":"R Rice","address":"6115 Peachtree Dunwoody Rd, Ste 120","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Today a few of us in my office decided to order from R Rice today (takeout).

Enter Two Urban Licks. I love the location, it's more or less right in my new neighborhood and does have nice view of the sunset overlooking the belt line. However, give the high marks on the review I think I may have set my expectations a bit too high. Don't get me wrong, the place is A-OK (hence 3 stars, because that is what it means)... but, I'm not reserving it at the top of my list of where to take out of towners that come to visit me. Heres the skinny:\\n\\nAmbiance is really cool, industrial inside. Super cool, but can be noisy from the high ceilings and concrete floors. I still like the decor and such. The way thy do win is pretty nice also, 2 different glass sizes for their \\"wines\\" on draft plus bottle size options if you like. They also have a wine list if you want regular bottles. Neat concept and different from what I've seen at other places. \\n\\nFood: We ordered the calamari for an appetizer because my step dad loves it and nearly ALWAYS will order it if its on the menu. Needless to say, I've eaten my fair share of it. I like the sauce they put on it. However, the breading was a little too salty for my taste and the calamari was a bit over cooked and rubbery. If/when I come back, I would likely order something else instead.\\n\\nOn a side note, I love that not good for you oily-ish bread they give you. So good with a touch of rosemary. Yum, I could eat 8 pieces of that stuff.\\n\\nStepdad got the bar steak for his entr√©e and had no complaints. The man had the seared tuna salad that is currently on the menu. He enjoyed it and said the portion size was just right, tuna was cooked well. His only complaint was that it was swimming in dressing, he said the dressing was good... but there was a lot of it. (I did not taste their meals so can't comment further).\\n\\nI ordered the Bronzed Scallops. This dish comes with 3 gigantic scallops atop a bed of gouda grits, surrounded by a moat of thick and spicy tomato broth. I did enjoy this dish. The scallops were nicely done and the grits were delicious and creamy. Unlike the calamari, I would probably order this again. I was quite good, if you like scallops give this dish a try. Really nicely done & great balance of flavors.\\n\\nThe only other thing I didn't love is that our waiter, whom was really sweet and attentive, hovered entirely too much. Except when I wanted another glass of wine of course. I'm of the camp I don't like to be rushed enjoying my meal and I don't like my main coming out with the appetizers. We usually order them apart to ensure they don't come together....but, I dislike feeling pressured to order. Especially when it wasn't all that busy the night we were there, so maybe he was bored? Anyhow, he was nice so I don't fault him for it. \\n\\nTo sum things up: \\n\\n- great beltline view\\n- industrial ambiance that can be noisy\\n- skip the calamari\\n- bread & scallops are yum\\n- hovercraft waitstaff - they are nice, but interrupt you a lot"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Crazy donut place, crazy donuts, crazy people.

The guy behind the counter was very accommodating in substituting extra salad for the rice/couscous/fries option. That was a major plus in my book! However, the salad left a lot to the imagination. Shredded romaine lettuce, one grape leaf, some cut up pickles, and a couple of tomatoes didn't really do it for me. I would have loved to have the tomato salad I saw behind the counter, but apparently that wasn't an option. The falafel was cooked fresh and was pretty good as far as Boston falafel goes. Having lived throughout the Middle East and eaten my fare share of falafel, I was suitably satisfied. I was a bit sad that they didn't have any spicy sauce as most places that serve Middle Eastern fair do. The Frank's Red Hot they had available seemed blasphemous.

Once inside the tables we had reserved was not available and we sat wait ing for a table for an hour, what's the point of a reservation if there isn't a table reserved for you! Way overpriced!!

Only 3 other people in the place, 2 of them were these hyper unsupervised brats\\n acting like idiots bouncing all over the empty chairs and tables. Waited over 15 minutes for my sandwich, no fries to be cooked, no drink, just a cold sandwich! I picked out the cleanest dirty table, sat down in one of their hollowed out, rickety, child size aluminum chairs, (they must have got a good deal at the local Dollar Store), put my food down, and the table started to tip over since the legs weren't balanced and there was a hole in the floor as well. I came close to falling over on my face towards the floor. The three oblivious giggling teenage girl servers were too engrossed with their Dumbphones to ask me if I was okay, or even care for that matter. So after finding a spot that wasn't going to send me to the ER, I opened the wrapper to my Junior Beef. Brought it up to my mouth, right away I smelled a foul oder. Took a bite, spit it out. Thought I got a bad piece of meat in it. Took another bite, same thing. Tasted like meat left out in the sun all day, putrid and nasty. I was so livid at this point, I couldn't be bothered asking to see the manager for my money back since there wasn't one there anyways, just young and dumb kids, even the so called \\"cook\\".

I agree the decor is a big improvement from what they had before under the previous owners and the server was very friendly.  \\n\\nOne very nice touch was that instead of lemon or lime in the water, they put a thin slice of cucumber (which looked like lime), and gave a refreshing cooling feel to it.

The lemongrass chicken had a nice crust, and had been well marinated.  But it wasn't anything that different from many of the casual places along Kingsway.  Certainly nothing different enough to justify the price tag compared to those places.  It came with a small green papaya salad, which was refreshing, but again not mind blowing.  The luc lac was disappointingly served just over rice instead of watercress.  I normally like the contrast, but it just wasn't there.  The beef was well marinated, but still had a slightly odd chew to it.  It was also overly sweetened - getting close to those goopy stir frys you find at really nasty Canadian Chinese restaurants that serve lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, etc.  It came with the same small papaya salad.

Whenever I end up coming here, it's usually never my choice. If I could give two and a half stars it would definitely be a lower rating. I think the main attraction for this place is the fact that it's a close, decent Cantonese food place for all the disillusioned, lost souls from Bodton University who are craving Chinese food. First of all, the service is pretty bad. I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants considering my parents work in some and I never found it so hard to wave down the waiters especially when they don't come around to check on you and then when you do they proceed to respond in a snide tone. While I don't think they should fake a more approachable and welcoming tone either, it would be a lot more of an enjoyable experience if they were more attentive and not just being ready to bounce away. Usually if you can speak Cantonese at a Cantonese restaurant, they're a bit more responsive to you but the more recent time I came here it was a mess... I ordered 7 dishes and 2 of them were not what I wanted at all. I order the typical sizzling black peppered veal (spoken in Cantonese) but they gave us one without sauce and the sizzling plate. Granted I didn't actually say the sizzling part because its always usually implied at every other Chinese restaurant I've been to but seriously, who would actually just order the non-saucy one? It's a staple Cantonese dish that shouldn't have come out like this. And this dish particularly stuck out to me because not only was it not something I wanted but the meat was super chewy too and they barely gave you any with the majority of the plate being string beans instead. The other dish that was not clearly communicated was the salt baked chicken. There was definitely salt on it but they seemed to have totally disregarded the baked portion as I'm pretty sure they just gave us steamed chicken. Overall, the dishes for the most part were only okay and they were pretty stingy with the portions too, covering most of the plate with more of the side items than the main item. Not to mention their foods are excessively oily too, like even more so than a lot of other Chinese places. This also be a bit biased of me because as I am writing this, the more and more I recall disliking the experience. I wouldn't necessarily refuse to come to this place because ultimately its a convenient place for Chinese food but it would never be my first choice.

The industrial style decor with the square kitchen highlighting the center of the floor was incredible to look at. We walked past the bar to notice the 3-story keg system that was adjacent to the server station. We were hooked. We were seated up stairs to overlook the whole restaurant. Our server Malik was nothing short of fantastic. We started with the Salmon Chips, which I will say I heard about before showing up and was still hesitant to get them, but malik reassured us it was the \\"right choice\\". And boy was he right! I would order those instantly again. We also ordered the crab cake which was also very mouthwatering! For entrees, I could not gather the strength to NOT order the brisket, as the smell of the smoked deliciousness filled your nose the second you walked in. Again, it was the right choice! And the mexican corn side was perfectly paired with a HUGE slab of brisket! My wife order the scallops. Yet again, another home run. We were so full that the thought of dessert was too much but I did comment to my wife that she could not send a scallop back uneaten! So we forced that down before we called it a dinner. This place is now an instant choice for any special occasion meal/dinner or for a place I want to highlight Atlanta's food scene with visiting family/friends. Thanks for the amazing meal!

I only go to Sonic for drinks and ice cream for the most part. Well my wife and I went here today because she was craving a treat. We pull up and the outside has trash all over the place...which didn't immediately put me off because something could've happened recently and employees might have been too busy to immediately clean the area (I always give benefit of the doubt). But we pull in and I want to try something new and see a \\"chocolate Dr Pepper\\" as a signature drink. I'm thinking, hmm that sounds interesting I'll give it a try. So I push to order and I order my wife a Reeses blast and then I ask for a diet chocolate Dr Pepper. The employee says,\\" chocolate Dr Pepper?!?\\" as if she thinks that what I'm ordering is weird. I tell her, \\"yeah? it's on your list of signature drinks, isn't it?\\" She says, \\"okay\\" in a sarcastic tone. Now when I'm placing this order, I'm thinking that I'm going to get a Dr Pepper with chocolate flavoring added to the drink. So our order comes, and everything looks good according to the receipt and whatnot. We are kind of in a rush to get home, so I drive off and my wife starts enjoying her blast by just drinking up the ice cream part and saving the reeses for last. We are already out of the parking lot and I take a sip of my drink and it just tastes like diet Dr Pepper, hardly any chocolate flavor to it. We get home and my wife finishes the ice cream part of her blast, gets out a spoon to eat the reeses, only to find out that the candy is mostly snickers. There were a little bit of reeses on top and so it looks great, but after all the ice cream was gone she realized it was pretty much all snickers, which gets extremely chewy and hard when cold...not at all what she likes. So the. I get to the bottom of my drink, only to find that the bottom just has a layer chocolate syrup. Not really what I was expecting when ordering, but they could've at least mixed it up or something. Anyways, drinks were poor, location was dirty, and service was not very friendly.

In between an alumni event and a movie, we were looking for a drink and some good food.  K+D was on the way and, lucky for us, there was plenty of room at the bar.  Our bartender/server, Miles, was excellent.  He helped us pick our drinks and our wine, both of which were great.  Then, looking over the menu, we noticed the pressed duck for two.  Miles told us all about the dish and explained that it was one of the stand-out items on the menu.  He was right.  We didn't have to travel to NYC and track down Daniel Boulud.  K+D has a duck press and does it right here in Atlanta.  And let me tell you, it was an outstanding dish.  Now if you aren't into duck and hate fatty foods then it isn't for you.  The pressed duck was intense, but in the best way imagineable.  They serve it two ways.  The first is the breast, skin on, in the pressed duck sauce with all the boney, marrowy, ducky essence and hint of liver for richness.  Duck fat potatoes are nice addition to this plate.  Then the legs are fried and served with kale and some pickled tomatoes for contrast.  Simply put, the meal was outstanding.  And the service was great.  Morever, the setting was both classic and contemporary at the same time.  Not since I ate at the bar at Ssam Bar in NYC have I had such a great experience dining at the bar of a restaurant.  I really recommend that you check out this particular dish at K+D.  I am holding off on five starts until I can try more of the menu.

Turkey burgers here are SICK! so good... seriously... i went a little crazy one time and got pimento cheese AND american cheese and i was in cheesy heaven... everyone i have taken here says this place is awesome... i'm seriously confused yelpers as to how you don't see the same!

He ordered a burger and I ordered the steak tips. The waiter (Matt w) told us the sweet potato fries are big and delicious- my boyfriend upgraded his fries to sweet potato based on Matt's recommendation. When our food arrived, my boyfriend had 4 sweet potato \\"fries\\" that were just raw quartered pieces of whole sweet potato. This being out first time here we were a bit confused. We're from out of town and thought maybe this part of New England had a claim to fame on raw sweet potato hunks? What? So I curiously asked our waiter and he laughed at the mix up and apologized and got us some thick cut sweet potato fries right away. He handled the issue so quickly and with humor which made us feel better about receiving raw potato hunks. Anyhow, the food is a bit above mediocre but their specialty focaccia is ridiculously good.

First of all I'm in the food preparation and service industry so If I come back it won't be for the food.  I arrived there about 4 minutes after they were opened  for lunch and there was a group of 6 already seated giving their drink orders so I saw a menu grabbed it and sat in a booth diagonal from them. Guess what, the staff could clearly see me sitting there for quite a few minutes but I was ok since I was trying to log onto the free Wifi which did not WORK and a computerized voice  announced that fact proudly over the PA system after I had fiddled with it. So, I walked up to the bar with menu in hand. Three staff members were right there by the bar and I must have been invisible because not one of them acknowledged my presence. I spoke up and said, \\"I would like to place on order\\". They looked at me like I was  Martian from Venus. Mind you this place had just opened and they were not busy in the least.

We even had dessert, but i wasnt full, so expect to spend 50+per person to be full.\\n\\nOctopus was the best. I really dislike octopus, but yesterdays octopus was different. The texture is bizarre. Its consistency was of a foie gras, a hard tofu, or a very soft vienna sausage. Octopuses usually is chewy and fishy, but this one takes you to soft mellow heaven of flavors.\\n\\nThe next dish i liked was the beef tarter. I have only tried korean and french beef tarter, and peruvian tarter was a unique and awesome experience. Thanks, andina for giving me such an awesome dish. Loved the unpeeled nut, it was very exotic and crunchy, adding nice texture and flavor to the dish.\\n\\nI loved the scallop with fried onion, although i wish the onion was crispier and i hoped they had put more acid factor in the sauce. It was a bit too oily dish, but i balanced out with very acidic blue marine sashimi dish.\\n\\nOnly complaint about the sashimi was how they had cut the fish in cube. Maybe that is peruvian style, but fish tastes better when it is not cut in cubes. It might be a personal opinion- but japanese ppl wouldnt have cut the fish like how they do for no reasons. Cutting in cube is way easier, so i believe and taste that cube looses the texture and flavor of sashimi.\\n\\nAnd the flan was out of this world.

I made sure to get there early to beat the rush, but I unfortunately got stuck behind the person with a complicated order and with communication issues. I knew this was their opening week and they were trying to work out the kinks, but I didn't find my experience to be anything stellar and worth my money and time to eat there again.\\n\\nLike I said, I got there right when they opened to beat the rush and walked right up to the counter. I'd reviewed the menu online and already knew what I wanted. The man working behind the counter was very friendly and made my pizza the way I specified. However, the lady in front of me had a lot of trouble. She was getting two pizzas, I think for coworkers, and the man behind the counter was not getting it right. The glass counters are really high (for food safety, I get it), and the music was pretty loud too. Both were working against this lady. The manager came up at one point and tried to help mediate the situation. And, as comes with two custom pizzas, the cooking time took awhile. Overall, this quick lunch run ended up taking a lot longer than I planned. And it wasn't just me, everyone was waiting a long time to get their food, as I learned from making small talk with other people awkwardly standing around the soda machine.\\n\\nHowever, on a positive note: I like the fact that they have a screen on the front of the POS that itemizes your order. And, the cashier took the time to read it back to me to confirm I was paying for the right order. After the transaction was complete, he told me my pizza \\"was made with love\\", but I couldn't feel it between his flat tone and unenthusiastic facial expression.\\n\\nOnce I got my pizza (15 minutes later), it was in a huge box. Turns out they ran out of personal pizza boxes and had to give me a large box instead. It would have been okay if I wasn't also trying to carry a drink without a lid. Yup, they were out of lids too. Apparently, they hadn't ordered enough supplies in anticipation of the traffic a free pizza offer would bring in.

I'm not a huge okra fan in general). My friend got the 4-veggie plate ($11.50) in which you get to choose 4 sides as your meal - I could see this being good for vegetarians. She got the dumplings (SO GOOD. We had never tried them before, too), collard greens, fried green tomatoes (maybe my new favorite side!), and the tomato pie, which was some sort of tomatoes/mayo in a pie crust. \\n\\nThe chicken was fantastic and I wish I had my leftovers today to eat (I was leaving Atlanta that day, so I do not, unfortunately), as I was only able to finish about half my plate. I definitely ate all of the sweet potato souffle, though, and we polished off the dumplings and fried green tomatoes too.

I've been curious about this place for quite some time and since I no longer live in Vantucky my trips up there are few and far. I wanted to meet up here with my business partner on another project that I am currently working on for dinner and just a brief update on things to come. We walked in to the restaurant and were seated promptly by a hostess. The atmosphere was very inviting and didn't feel like it was too casual or overtly pretentious. After we were seated we were greeted fairly shortly by our server/ hostess Rhiannon. She took our drink orders and asked us what type of soup we would like. After a short period of time she came back with our drinks and soups and talked to us about how the mongolian grill worked. She sent us on our way and we began our trip down the mongolian trail of buffet goodness. \\n\\nAs I walked down the uncooked food there was quite an array of just everything. The meat alone was plentiful and very fresh and had everything from beef to fresh seafood and even lamb and turkey. There was also a large selection of fresh veggies from your usual cabbage, carrots, and spinach to your little more exotics like baby corn, water chestnuts, and cilantro. Now getting down to the sauces I was very impressed. First off the garlic there was freshly cut and not your jar variety minced garlic although most of the sauces were watered down which is not out of the ordinary there was also a selection of dried spices and herbs which made our meal even more unique. I walk up to the cook and he gladly placed my food onto the grill with care and began his tossing and turning of my creation. After about a few minutes he came back and delivered my cooked meal on a nice plate and my friend and I walked back to our table and began our meal. \\n\\nI was very impressed. It always seems to me that every time I go to a Mongolian place the food always seems to taste the same even if you change the variations a little. On this trip I made a point to keep the sauces the same to see if there would be any difference and I will say it was a huge difference. There was also more hot food along the wall on the south end of the building that consisted of your fried won tons, chicken wings, fried rice and some salad and fruit as well. After our meal was done we were offered peppermint ice cream and that really rounded the meal off fairly well. \\n\\nOverall, this is definitely a must do venue if you enjoy Mongolian style food. Huge difference in taste and the service from this location was definitely 5 stars. Rhiannon made a point to come by our table frequently to see how we were doing and kept our glasses of iced tea full. She was also very courteous and on every request was able to fulfill them promptly. Now you're probably wondering why I didn't give this place 5 stars? Good question my dear. The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars was two things that they could easily change. The baby corn that you get anywhere from asian restaurants in general come in a can. Now my experiences with this is that you need to rinse them in cold water to get the metallic taste from sitting in the can out of them. Apparently someone forgot to do that. The second thing that happen was I noticed the cook was sweating on his forehead profusely while cooking our food.  That just doesn't look very appetizing watching a cook sweat over your food. I made a brief mention to our server and hopefully this will be resolved as well. Don't let that stop you from checking this place out because you will truly miss out on this far east adventure filled with flavors that will entice all your senses. \\n\\nHappy Eating Everyone....\\n\\np.s. Someone made a mention on another review stating a couple  of things. first off someone said that the cook made a point to stare at you to make sure you tipped him. This was not the case with our cook this evening. Secondly, someone else made a mention as well that booths were very cramped. I'm also a size 34-36 and I didn't seem to have a problem. Not gonna lie I'm also a bigger then normal guy and I found myself to be rather comfortable this evening. Don't let a few poor reviews steer you away from here.

The chicken on the spit is huge though, like, I don't know how I would feel about a chicken that big coming at me, but the meat was very flavorful, not dry at all and had a prominent curry like taste which was great when paired with the additional (free) toppings which included: pickles, cucumbers, humus, lettuce, tomato etc. \\nThe pita bread itself was delicious (like most carbs are!!) It was warm, tough on the outside but fluffy on the inside and held up very well even though my pita was overloaded with stuff. \\n\\nIt was a bit messy to eat, but good. The fries were on the smaller portion, but decent as they were hot out of the fryer. \\n\\nThe cashier / manager was very cheerful and pleasant, he even helped me bring everything out to the table since there are no trays and gave us complimentary appetizers (fried chickpea balls) which was also good. \\n\\nAlthough they are good and a nice, different option from other establishments in the area, I just can't summon the foodie enthusiasm of eating chicken pita, maybe I'm just stubborn and set in my ways of having a lamb gyro.

I wished to ask the waitress that due to her error, we would not longer be needing the tataki but just when I stood up to do so, she brought it to us. My party had made up their minds that they were done eating so when I asked her to pack it, she rolled her eyes at me as I handed her the dish, and when it came time to pay, I tipped her as generously as I deemed acceptable. I didn't undertip but I also didn't overtip. When the receipt printed and I asked her for my copy, her body language seemed to communicate her displeasure with me and slammed my copy down with some force. I'm a generally courteous person so I said thank you, but she just walked away with a \\"hmph\\" sound under her breath. \\nNow, that said, I understand that everyone has their off days but since this has happened I haven't been back."},{"name":"Zesto - Atlanta","address":"377 Moreland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I like this place a lot.

Supposedly this is the spot where out of town visitors HAVE to check out before they leave Portland. From what I hear, Voodoo Doughnut is splattered all over the Food Network on various shows. \\n\\nThe line was about a solid 20-25 minute to just get into the store. Keep in mind that there is a line inside the store but isn't long because the store itself is quite small. Does anyone notice the XXX raunchy theatre next door? I was just standing there in line, trying to find some shade when I look up and the sign reads, \\"Hentai\\" on such and such days/times. Funny, I didn't over hear anyone else in line say a thing about this theatre. I even saw some dude come out of there and he had the \\"You didn't see me!\\" look on his face.\\n\\nEventually, we finally got into the place and it's only about 1-2pm now. At this point of time, I tell my friend to get me the maple bacon bar since that's what everyone raves about. I had to rush out to the car because our parking time limit was running out. The parking nazi was walking around and handing out tickets with a smirk. \\"I gotta go check that biznatch! Maple bacon bar please! See you at the car.\\" and so I jam.\\n\\nMy friend comes out with that noticeable pink doughnut box but I noticed her grim face right away. The words I didn't want to hear was spoken, \\"They ran out of the maple bacon bar.\\" WTF??? It's only 2pm and you're out of it already! Granted, it's damn popular but that sucks. I settled with the powdered rasberry filled doughnut that tasted like any other Cambodian doughnut shop in So Cali. She got the c*ck & balls doughnut for her friend which was for her bday. That's always a good laugh (picture to come). Had to be a huge chocolate one too.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm not sure if it was worth the wait. Honestly, I'm like whatevers.

The 5 Elementos ceviches are tart with the fish fresh and textured - laced with just the right amount of cilantro. The pimento piquillo relleno was brilliantly presented and whose appearance was only exceeded by its flavor mix of piquant pepper against bits of salty ham, cheese and quinoa. The Picadillo Acebichado is a unique take on beef tartar that is a wonderful contrast in the same meal to the fish ceviche. This is dining at its finest. Service was fine.

For context, I'm a graduate student and have been to Cherry Street exclusively for lunch between classes, so either at 12pm or 3pm.\\n\\nMy first experience was so-so. I went with a group of friends. We split the seasonal veggies & mozzarella salad, which was delicious. I ordered a pizza for lunch and aside from the burnt crust, it was really tasty. Service was alright.\\n\\nThe next time I went, it was just two people at about 3pm. The service was outstandingly bad. We were on a tight timetable between classes, and the server ignored us for several customers who were sitting at the bar ordering cocktails. We eventually had to walk over to the bar and insist on paying at the register after he told us he'd bring our check. I was incredibly disappointed because of how much I'd enjoyed the food, but I didn't appreciate being ignored in favor of more gregarious customers. The food was excellent, but the service was so terrible I was pretty determined not to go there again.\\n\\nI'm glad I did, though, because my third experience was truly excellent -- I went with a small group. We split the arrabiata and mozzarella appetizer, which is simply OUTSTANDING. One of the best things I've ever tasted. For the main course, a friend and I split the butternut squash gnocchi and we literally spent about twenty minutes going \\"WOW. OMG. WOW\\" after every bite. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, the food is outstanding (if overpriced), but the service needs serious work. I seem to have gotten better service in larger groups, but for a restaurant that must attract a fair amount of twosomes, that is highly problematic! I'll probably go back because it's one of the best of the very few food options near the building where I have classes, but I'd appreciate servers that can accommodate speedy meals and pay more attention to their guests."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been lucky enough now to go here twice, and each time I thoroughly enjoyed myself! This place is absolutely fantastic. My only warning would be that it IS difficult to get into in the sense of the small parking-lot maze that you are required to traverse to actually find the restaurant -- but let's put it this way. Many restaurants survive based on \\"street traffic,\\" or people walking or driving by and stopping in. For Two Urban Licks, that possibility is virtually nonexistent, and yet at busy times it is STILL a hopping joint! That's just how good this place is. \\n\\n -- The service has been truly stellar both times I've gone, though both servers could not have been more different in personality. Absolutely amazing to have such top-notch service. \\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS: \\n -- Sad to say, I cannot eat fish, so I can't try the salmon chips that everyone else raved about. I absolutely LOVED the empanadas, though; they are not to be missed! They were the perfect combination of spicy, tangy, and crisp. I could not believe them. I had them both times I went. \\n\\n -- The brisket! Someone else got this and I was just about ready to steal their plate. It was meltingly good, and even better with the mac and cheese. Something about the combination of the two just made everything more spectacular. \\n\\n -- I can also vouch for the pork shoulder and the bbq chicken. Amazing! \\n\\n -- My table mates got the popcorn sundae and were not really impressed. Apparently it was good, but the only \\"popcorn\\" was 3-4 pieces scattered over the top. On the other hand, the donuts with chocolate sauce were absolutely divine. I saw the cupcakes going by but did not try one, they looked absolutely adorable! Definitely going to have to try some of the other desserts here. \\n\\n -- I have to say, I also loved the drinks here. They were really creative, really fun, and really very good.

I first heard about this place in an article from Eater Boston ranking the top ramen shops in the area. After trying out a few places, I was getting disappointed but kept on trucking trying to find my go-to ramen joint. Does Ganko Ittetsu deliver? Well, you've stumbled across the best review. Read more below.\\n\\nReview #056\\nRestaurant Type: Casual Dining. \\n\\nFood (65%) \\n Taste to price 4/5\\n Quality to price 4/5\\n Portion to price 4/5\\n Average = 4\\n\\nService (20%)  \\n Friendliness 4/5\\n Promptness 4/5\\n Average = 4\\n\\nCleanliness (15%) \\n Bathroom n/a\\n Dining area 4/5\\n Kitchen area 4/5\\n Average = 4\\n\\nOverall Score = [F(.65)]+[S(.20)]+C(.15)]\\n  = [2.6]+[0.8]+[0.6] \\n  = 4\\n\\nThe Pluses...  \\n+ Simple, easy MENU to follow. It's literally a piece of paper printed on both sides. Nothing fancy or gimmicky. Just 6 types of ramen soups, sides, and a beer section. They don't waste time trying to sell anything else, they know exactly what they are. I like it!\\n+ Clean, nice, modern interior and AMBIANCE. \\n+ I only come here for the GANKARA MISO RAMEN. I don't even need to try the other soups. This one is nicely spiced and rich in pork flavor. The egg is perfectly cooked, and the egg noodle texture has the right amount of chew for my liking. \\n+ For a tiny place, they are very efficient with handling the WAIT TIME. You can join the wait list on Yelp, check in, and walk around the area. They'll text you when the table is ready. Fortunately there's lots of window shopping and people watching in the area to kill time. \\n+ The wait team works really well together. Speedy, responsive, and harmonious like synchronized swimmers :)\\n\\nThe Negs...\\n- No major negatives here. If I had to knit pick it would be that the broth can be salty but I found this to be true at 95% of ramen places I've been to. \\n- Parking can be difficult. There's public parking in the back and street parking but these fill out quick especially during weekends.  \\n- This place is small. Anticipate sitting close to strangers and moderate wait times. \\n\\nIn Conclusion...\\nYep, all it took was one visit to Ganko Ittetsu and I was hooked. Ganko Ittetsu Ramen, imo, is one of Boston's best ramen shop. It's no surprise why people keep coming back here including myself. They offer a very solid experience: delicious ramen, ambiance, service, and speediness. They know exactly what they are and they don't try to be anything else. I've been coming here for years so I'd say it's worth a stop. \\n\\n#ChowYouLater\\n\\n**If you enjoyed my review and need help with the Boston area, follow or add me as a friend.

Let's face it, Voodoo Doughnuts would not be what it is if it was placed in any other city.  That being said, I ONLY go to Voodoo if I am with an out of town guest.  \\n\\nWhile I am not a doughnut fan to begin with, Voodoo just doesn't do it for me.  Big props on pushing the envelope with creative and quirky flavor combos (with names to match) - NOTE: bacon on a doughnut should be a standard around the country.  But when it comes overall eating pleasure, I find myself disgusted after my second bite.  Sugary and overly rich, eating these doughnuts for me becomes more of a chore than a choice.  \\n\\nFrom the visitors perspective, I get it.  National media attention, late night hours, outrageous offerings,  one-of-a-kind doughnuts, etc.  However, eating as a tourist is much different from eating in your hometown.  For goodness sake, I am the guy that ate fugu semen while on vacation!  What I mean is that we are all looking for that singular, foreign experience - and Voodoo provides just that.\\n\\nIf Voodoo is your thing, more power to you!

These hardworking guys always seem dedicated to bringing your food fast and hot while willing to get anything additionally you require even if they aren't chirpy like a Linda-Lu waitress with a smile.  Don't confuse this food direct-to-table service with a restaurant, it's counter-order, find a table, wait a few minutes, and delish.  \\n\\nDelish is indeed the word that sums this place up.  Lite flavors, delicate preparation, it's charming breakfast food rather than heaps of overwhelming pancakes and greasy sausages.  Personally, I'd spring the extra dollar or two for the omelet if I was really hungry.  However, the crepes will do more than enough to fill you up.  The availability of sweeter Nutella or desert crepes and breakfast omelet crepes is a nice option.  \\n\\nWhile the interior is small you can either opt to get your food to go or you may have to wait a couple minutes for a table to open up.  Weekend mornings during the school year the place is always full but I've never had any trouble getting a table with a little patience, understanding, and friendliness with your fellow neighbor probably a laid-back college student who won't mind if you borrow an extra chair, a bottle of ketchup, or a packet of jam.

It was beautiful outside.  My girlfriend Kelly and I were walking on Broadway.  I was hungry.  She recommended Pescatore.  In my hungry state, I was open to just about anything and agreed.  However, this dining experience wasn't going to be just \\"any\\" dining experience.  Indeed it was one of the more memorable dining experiences I've had in a long time.  \\n\\nWe walked in the restaurant (the entrance, I may note, is not obvious from the street), and immediately decided to go to the bar.  We love sitting at bars, but this was special.  Cory, the bartender, immediately commented on how we were a \\"groundbreaking\\" couple.  The bar, it turns out is newly installed and they hadn't had many people sit at it for dinner yet.  \\n\\nTaps weren't yet installed, nor was the TV, and the bartenders collaborated when making the cocktails because they hadn't made the ones we ordered before.  This may make it sound lackluster, but actually it added to the charm.  This wasn't a place that didn't care, it was a place that was growing, learning.  You could feel the momentum.  \\n\\nYou don't need a narrative of our dinner, but here's some highlights that make this place shine:\\n\\n* The bartender Cory was very attentive and conversational  He and Rob (the other bartender on duty) both work at Harpoon as well, and just both seemed like great guys.  Cory's shift ended mid-way through our meal, and he was kind enough to come over, shake hands, and excuse himself, as Rob took over for him. \\n\\n* There were black olives served with the olive oil and bread (from Iggy's, amazing).  When Kelly and I finished the olives off quickly, they brought us extra olives.  I love olives (what can I say, I'm half-Italian).  People can impress me with olives, yes it's that simple.  \\n\\n* The food was phenomenal.  I mean, my late Great Nana from Italy would have a run for her money here.  My girlfriend had the soup special - which was seafood in a light tomato broth, which was absolutely amazing.  (This place is called Pescatore for a reason).  I went the land (and admittedly less Italian) route and had the steak tips.  Didn't matter that it wasn't an Italian dish.  They nailed it.  The steak was juicy and exceptionally marinated, cooked just at medium.  The spinach was sauteed to perfection and the mashed potatoes were a lesson in creamy potato excellence.\\n\\n* After finishing our cocktails, we split a glass of a $98 Barolo.  That's right, they were offering a $98 bottle of Barolo wine by the glass (for $16).  Win.    \\n\\n* A server who was eating pizza at the bar offered us a slice from the kitchen (it was getting late and things were winding down).  Their pizza is amazing.  Their pizza is like a little bit of Italy, but in Somerville.  Knowing how good the pizza is will make it hard for me to make a different choice when I  go back.\\n\\nAnd I will go back.  And I'll likely sit at the bar.  The bartenders are great.  The food is fantastic.  And the atmosphere is casual, but nice.  (I was wearing flip-flops though, if it makes anyone questioning dress-code feel better.)  If sitting at bars isn't for you, you should still come; they have a recently expanded dining room -- white tableclothes, and what looks to be a classy experience.  \\n\\nIn short: dinner win.

At least since they were in the old location, when I was just an 80% vegetarian, so at least 10 years.  As a footloose and fancy free early twenty-something, I would go to study on the screened in porch where you could still smoke and drink coffee for hours, maybe play a game of Yahtzee with a friend if we were just killing time and looking for somewhere to be (those were the days!) And then I got a little older and came regularly for Camp Camp open mic nights, one of the few queer things to do in town that was free and always interesting... I cannot express how grateful I am for the spaces in Austin that are not necessarily queer but open their doors for such events, so Bouldin and Leslie always have my heart.\\n\\nAnyway, as a solid vegetarian for the past 8 years, the food is hands down my favorite so far as straight vegetarian restaurants go in town (sorry Mother's and Madras, you are not nearly as consistent, cheap, or friendly). Their tofu scrambler is the best I have ever tasted, and it's my \\"go-to\\" whenever I am traveling and encounter any place that does vegan brunch... Portland, Seattle, all the usual suspects don't even have a clue, it just tastes like salty, wetted cardboard everywhere else. I am a pretty good tofu ninja if I do say so myself, and I have gotten  close, but Bouldin still holds the cigar. I think they put (vegan) crack in it, but I could be wrong. \\n\\nI am a little sad to see the old place go, but the new (ish, how many years has it been now) one is bigger and more New Austin so I can't really fault them for that, our sleepy little college town is a burgeoning metropolis and there's no way we can send California back now.

The po boy was highly recommended by the waitress and didn't disappoint.  The addition of fried pickles was great and there was no skimping on the shrimp.

I made reservations for four far in advance for a Friday night. I arrived 45 minutes before our reservation, so I ordered a drinks for my parents. Since it was a nice evening, I asked if our party could sit outside. 15 minutes after our scheduled reservation, we still were not seated. Since the hostess could not accommodate us outside, I asked if we could sit at a booth with ample seating. She told me booths are reserved for parties of 6-8, and my party consisted of four people. I said well since we've technically been waiting for 1 hour, the least you could do was give us the booth we asked for. We settled for a smaller table. The food was sub par and the drinks left much to be desired. Needless to say, I will not be returning to Two Urban Licks at all. The service, food, and beverages were below margin, at best.

The burger was meh, the Balboa was also meh, the chickpea burger feel apart and had so much junk on it that it wouldn't have made it into my mouth anyway,  thus it was pretty much inedible and the eggplant panini sucked. The bread was charred, the tapende was so overpowering (and I got a nice olive pit in one bite - that shouldn't happen ever) that after a few bits you couldn't taste anything but it. It was greasy on top of its other issues.\\n\\nI think that if I am spending north of $9 on a sandwich or burger, it better be pretty friggin stupendous. I should eat the whole thing.

On our first trip we took the recommendation of the waiters and got the \\"roasted\\" pizza. WOW - this must be what pizza supposed to taste like!  You can tell pizza is their big draw, because there is usually a line (albeit a short line) of people waiting near the bar to pick up their to-go boxes. \\n\\nI think most people who have eaten a lot of pizza realize that less is more. Too many toppings muddle the flavors and create chaos for your taste buds. All elements (crust, sauce, toppings) should work together, but they should also be stars in their own rights. Reale's roasted pizza hits this mark. In fairness, I haven't tried many other types of pizzas there, because my memories of the roasted pizza always consume me (puns intended). \\n\\nThe restaurant is really charming, and the strip mall location helps emphasize the feeling that you've found a diamond in the coal mine. The neighborhood feel is apparent in the way that customers are recognized as regulars, and the owners frequently mingle with the guests. \\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give more stars is that I'm less impressed with the rest of the menu. The pasta dishes I've had were good, but not standouts like the pizza. The antipasto is inelegant in its appearance, but the taste is great!
