Definitely coming here again!"},{"name":"Main Event - Atlanta","address":"3101 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 104","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Last weekend my co-workers and I decided to have our going away party here at Main Event Entertainment, this place is located right down the street from Akers Mill Shopping Center off Cobb Parkway. Above Main Event is the AMC Parkway Pointe 15.\\n\\n[ * Parking * ]\\n\\nParking here is horrible on the weekends, especially because of the movie theatre upstairs. If you come here I would highly suggest parking either in the underground parking lot or parking on the opposite side of Main Event where the Pier 1 Imports is located, there is parking on that side. All of the parking spaces in front of the movies/main event gets full early.\\n\\n[ * Games * ]\\n\\nThis place is HUGE, it looks like it is the size of a Wally World. The environment really reminds me of a Dave & Busters or Jillian's. They have lots of games to play, just look at the pictures to get an idea. \\n\\nAt this location they have arcade, bowling, laser tag, billiards/shuffleboard and gravity ropes, which is basically walking up above near the ceiling on a plank, so it requires excellent balancing skills.\\n\\nThe arcade games are anywhere from $1.00 to $5.00, from observing all of the games here, the average price was about $1.50 to $2.00, so those visiting Main Events, expect to spend some serious money if you plan on spending a few hours here. The laser tag here is a lot of fun, the cost is $8 during peak days/hours and lasts for about 10 minutes.\\n\\n[ * Bar * ]\\n\\nThe bar here is nice, however don't get a margarita here. One of my friends ordered one, so I had to have a sip and it was definitely made with finest call sweet and sour drink mix, or something very similar. That is not how a margarita is made, coming from someone who has literally made at least 50,000 margarita's as a mixologist. Here it is probably created with a 1oz pour of tequila and 6-8oz of sweet and sour mix. Fresh lime juice, simple syrup, grandma???\\n\\n[ * Service * ]\\n\\nThe service here was not as terrible as other reviews have pointed out. However, I will break it down. \\n\\nWhile here I only had a Coke that took literally 30-40 minutes for one refill. Another friend ordered two bud lights from the server and that took 20 minutes. Seriously? Bud lights do not even require a bottle opener, like most domestics, they have easy twist off caps. The bartender only has to hand the server the bottle. As a rule of thumb, if you want to get your drinks fast, ALWAYS get them from the bar.\\n\\nAnother friend ordered a hamburger while another had a chicken sandwich. When they came to the table, the one who ordered the hamburger received the chicken sandwich, with the hamburger side, and the one who ordered the chicken sandwich, received the hamburger with the others side. Not a big deal, but they came about 10 minutes apart, so we requested the manager who came promptly.\\n\\nThe manager, Paul did come out to our table right away and made sure everything was improved. Unlike the other reviews, where people complained about managers, Paul was very professional and did us right. Although other managers who I did see around the establishment, did not appear as friendly. Paul might have been the general manager and he waited until we received everything we ordered.\\n\\nOur server was Tamica and she was friendly, although she did seem a bit overwhelmed. Of course to be quite honest, this place is so packed, it is probably the norm here.\\n\\n[ * Bowling * ]\\n\\nWe really wanted to bowl while here and although we arrived at 8:30pm, they were booked until close, which is at 2am. So if you plan on coming here to bowl on a weekend that is probably not going to happen.\\n\\n[ * Laser Tag * ]\\n\\nAs previous mentioned, Laser tag is $8 and lasts for about 10 minutes. You pay, stay in line and wait till the doors open here and enter the waiting room. During this time, guests watch a brief movie that discusses how to play, this introduction movie is about 5 minutes, and then players enter the combat room where teams (red/blue) hide out or walk around to shoot their opponent. This is definitely a lot fun and a great way to take part in some form of physical activity.\\n\\n[ * Crowd * ]\\n\\nThis place is packed, especially with young kids and teenagers (which explains why they have a few police officers roaming around in the establishment). I cannot believe that some parents actually allow their 6-8 year old children to stay up past 10pm, but they do, even past midnight. The majority of the teenagers start to leave at midnight, so if you plan on playing pool or shuffleboard, you should arrive at midnight as the crowd starts to narrow down.\\n\\n[ * Summary * ]\\n\\nOverall, this is a fun place to hangout, I just wish I could give this place a higher rating, but because we were not able to go bowling, and due to the long wait times for food and drinks, I can only give this an okay rating, being three stars, that is the rational of my rating.\\n\\n[Review #255] (Fourteenth Review of 2015)"},{"name":"Suerte","address":"1800 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We ate at Suerte during a recent trip to Austin.

The last time, though, our restaurant experience was less than stellar.

After taking a scenic tour to our table, it was clearly too small for 5 so we walked all the way around to a far more appropriate table, which, needless to say, we should've been taken to in the first place.\\n\\nNow for the food:  it's really hit or miss here.  While last time I got a decent burger, this time I got an embarrassing steak 'n' cheese sandwich.  As soon as I got it, my first impression was that it wasn't filled nearly as much as I expected.  Worse yet, about half of the filling was peppers/mushrooms/onions, which is an add-on, not a substitution!  I distinctly recall ordering a steak 'n' cheese sandwich with vegetable toppings, NOT a vegetable sandwich with steak toppings!  The sandwich should be about 90% steak/cheese and 10% whatever you want on it, and not 50-50, that's a joke!

But they also have booze, they're open until midnight, and when they finish the patio, it's going to be that much cooler. \\n\\nJust to order something, I got the all-day bacon & egg thing and a vegetarian \\"Nashville Hot Tofu.\\" For a total of $7.85 it wasn't bad at all, if maybe a little short of being really good - if the tofu had been less spicy, it could actually have been more tasty.

And to be honest, this place is absolutely not bad! As a sister restaurant to next door, I thought this place was pretty decent and was unexpected to see how it compared. I do still have to say Shoya does better in the ramen department but this place isn't bad!\\n\\nShoya has a huge menu, everyone knows that if you have been there. The menu here isn't as big. I think it's a little bit more focused, but at the same time I have a suspicion that dishes here are created as a test bed for Shoya. Then again, I could be completely incorrect and that Shoya already has a winning menu that probably won't change and this restaurant is just sort of a test kitchen and gives the chefs a bit more of creative freedom.\\n\\nMy dinner was pretty simple, just ramen. The spicy tonkatsu ramen. The broth was good, it wasn't completely flavorless, but I would have to say it wasn't as strong as Shoya's. However, to get a spot here and be able to sit down immediately was a big draw for us. We did want to try out this place's ramen anyways. The side dishes weren't bad either. We ordered 2 baos, some fried chicken as well for appetizers. I felt that the appetizers were good and the baos were a little bit on the pricey side but overall was pretty tasty.\\n\\nThe service was fine, nothing too crazy there. The place also filled up pretty quickly during the dinner rush. We were the first one of the first ones there and by the time we left I would say half or 3/4 of the tables were filled up. I don't think you need reservations, but just note it does get busy here as well.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this place for ramen, but I would say as a second alternative compared to Shoya.

We shared a few cheese and charcuterie platters which were enjoyable. I had the Linguini di Seppia - lobster with squid ink pasta. It was okay, but I feel like you're paying for the location and atmosphere as the entree felt like something from Olive Garden. The linguini was over cooked and had no texture, and the lobster was really small and overdone/chewy. The flavor of the sauce was nice, but for $52 I expected much better food.

If they question it, tell them it's to verify the positive experiences mentioned so they can give credit where credit is due (since it's easy to falsify this info) and use it for training purposes. *\\n\\n-  Hire another manager/supervisor other than Misty, who answered the phone less than 5 feet from us, saying, \\"Whatever. Fuck!\\" Followed by, \\"Ooooh, I'm gonna be in trouble!\\" after my friend (someone in the service industry) and I were ignored for 5+ minutes upon our entrance to this Shari's while Misty STARED at us and 3 other employees walked past us. No acknowledgement whatsoever. Misty did not greet us, but said, \\"TWO\\" in a rude manner - a rhetorical question, I guess. Then the word \\"DRINKS\\" was delivered in the same tone. When we sat down, our table and booth were covered in sticky residue. Her friend, our server Roxane, did not even give us a minute to peruse the menu. While I enjoy fast service, not only was this TOO fast, but all of her questions/interactions were abrupt, unnatural, and the antithesis of the personality she displayed interacting with Misty. I have been here a number of times and can tell you this might have been the least busy I have seen this location during this time frame. When it's slow, you don't take the opportunity to ignore customers, lower service standards, chat incessantly with co-workers, and not clean up the restaurant.\\n\\nBesides the fact that Misty offered BELOW sub-par service and Roxane was ridiculously rushed and abrupt (for no reason at all), they were having entirely too loud and inappropriate conversations when service should be a priority. By the way, you should know that when I receive abrupt service in a slow restaurant, I add extra \\"UMMM's\\" and take my sweet time asking questions and making decisions.\\n\\nThe table across from us was ignored as well, and Misty yelled across the restaurant, \\"Roxane, you got table 32?! They're READY!\\" And minutes later proceeded to the section behind us and asked Roxane if she wanted to steal Jen's tip and split it. I don't know who Jen is, but that would upset me if I were her and Misty did no work to warrant getting any portion of that money.\\n\\nWe asked to split our bill at the register, telling Misty the exact dollar amount we would both have to pay - $15.86. Without tip, we owed $31.72 total for 2 drinks, 2 orders of potato wedges (4 each) and 2 orders of hot wings (~5 each). If you can't do simple math and it makes you treat people like crap, you need to not be dealing with receipts all day. She completely ignored our request initially, saying she would \\"get it as close as possible.\\" NO - we told you the exact amount. \\n\\nBoth of us normally tip at least 20%, but in this instance I wanted to leave absolutely nothing. Instead, we left a very, very small amount. This tip became an issue when Misty leaned over the glass counter partition to SEE the amount of the tip I was leaving, which was totally unnecessary.\\n\\nWith the number of people needing jobs, I just cannot understand this at all. I cannot. People that have worked at busier, more expensive restaurants are looking for work, and these people could care less. Because of this, and the fact that I was treated like I was nothing, I just cannot spend another dollar here.\\n\\nI usually do not get this detailed and upset, but after trying to submit a survey online and it mysteriously not working, I went back to re-submit and it told me I already submitted one this month and to come back later, without letting me leave contact info.

I remember mustard and relish, there may have been ketchup too. The hot dogs were exactly like I remembered. Juicy, delicious and they have that great snap when you bite in. \\n\\nMy boyfriend fancied a sandwich also and was interested in the ham salad. We were immediately told \\"that's an unusual order... I usually would order my ham salad in a cheese melt. With a mustard spread on the toast.\\" Well, sign me up. At this point I was ready to trust this guy's recommendations. I was just along for the ride. I'm still dreaming about this sandwich like over a week later. Salty, perfectly grilled (not overly greasy) and so so tasty. The mustard spread on the grilled side of the bread was mind-blowing, I think I'll be doing this on my own melts at home in the future. \\n\\nCherry on top is that we enjoyed some nice banter between the grill guy and our server about who held the hot dog eating record (it's 36 in one sitting if I recall correctly).

The concept of the restaurant is to use as much locally-sourced ingredients as possible, and that I very much appreciate. I had the fish of the day, which was Coho Salmon, and it rested on a bed of Corn & Edamame Stew and topped with Cilantro Chutney. The Salmon was cooked perfectly, and the waiter made sure to inform us that they only get their fish from certified sustainable fish farms. He also explained the process of the Edamame Stew and I might just attempt to re-create it at home. I mean, I seriously dislike edamame, and they made me actually love it in that stew!\\n\\nMy dining partner ordered the Bison Burger which came with salsa verde and three-cheese spread, both of which were amazing, and the choices for the side were Roasted Potato Wedges or Pearl Couscous. She had chosen the couscous but they mistakenly made it with the potato wedges instead. So we got to try both side dishes! The Roasted Potato Wedges had Panko sprinkled on them and I love Panko, so I loved this. The couscous was delicious, but I still prefer Moroccan couscous to the Pearl/Israeli couscous.\\n\\nBoth dishes were very cohesive and we were both very, very pleased.\\n\\nIn addition, they serve OBP and 3 beers from Orlando Brewing, for those who like beer to complement their meals.\\n\\nOur server, Noel, was extraordinarily friendly and courteous.

Would we like more bread? Yes....oh, none is baked. We'll get on that, says the server, sorry but it's still so early. What?? It's 12:30 and there are about 6 other people in the restaurant. Anyway we finish eating, never get more bread, pay the tab, and go.\\n\\nThe server seemed a little hesitant and inexperienced. I feel like many of them at this location, at least at lunch, are, and maybe that's why the service seems really spotty and overwhelmed. They're really trying, bless them, but just lack a little finesse. The food itself is pretty good, although often very inconsistent - chicken will be delicious one day, dry the next - pomodoro is heavily spiced with red pepper flakes once, but never again, etc. Also, why are there crayons and white paper on the table? The interior and pricing suggests they are trying for a more \\"upscale\\" chain atmosphere.....I guess one where you can draw pictures while you wait?\\n\\nRomano's downfall - at least this location - is a combination of an identity crisis and inexperienced staff. Our server yesterday said that the menu is being revamped later this month; maybe that will be a good result.

We came here on a Thursday evening for a good friends birthday. Myself and another arrived late to the dinner, but when we had arrived they had mentioned they already ordered drinks but had been waiting about 15 min so far. When the waiter arrived about 10 min after I sat, the rest of us quickly put in our drink and appetizer orders. We got our drinks and were ready to order, our waiter seemed very dazed ! Asked him simple questions about the menu and it was like he was completely out of it and confused. After taking our order, our appetizers finally came out. The stars are honestly because the Choriqueso is BOMB as hell. Would have preferred to eat them with their homemade chips but their homemade flour/corn tortillas were very good. \\n\\nOur service wasn't the greatest from the very start, he was scatter brained. But what really prompt this review is what after when the birthday girl order her second margarita in those pineapple cups. The birthday girl, who had been a waitress while in college, witnessed the waiter dropped the decoration for her drink and then put it BACK IN. Her drink was also also leaking allot and for some odd reason he still thought it'd be okay to give it to her. \\n\\nSo the birthday girl didn't want to say anything, but another person in our group actually manages a restaurant here in Austin and just couldn't let it go. She went in spoke with the manager and he came and spoke to us and apologized and then after Gabriela herself came and asked us how the service was.\\n\\nWhat really resonated and irritated me is that neither the manager or Gabriela offer to comp the birthday girl drink or offer her something for the inconvenience... on her birthday. Like not even a little desert . Just a \\" oh sorry that happened \\" . Just on a customer service standpoint if someone had these issues, i would try my best to regain their trust so you continue to visit us\\n\\nI hate leaving bad reviews, but it's just like ... dang both the manager and owner didn't feel the need to do anything about it"},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Fantastic huge patio.

The restaurant itself is in a shopping plaza with other major brands of chain restaurants, yet APM projected its quality. Open the door and you're transported to Italy. It's a typical Italian pizzeria set up....I forni (ovens), il muro di vino (wine wall) e il piacere di sentire la mia bella lingua (and the bliss of hearing my beautiful language!!!)\\n\\nThe pizzeria is family owned by a mother and son duo from South Italy having moved to the States 7 years ago. La mamma is in charge of the pasta and main courses while the son manages the perfection of the pizza while running front of house. \\n\\nLet's cut to the chase - the pizza is airy, robust, flavorful and crispy in all the right places. The crust presented with a char indicative of high temperature heat stemmed from coal ovens; it was airy, crispy yet doughy and held the toppings. If I had any feedback to give...i would encourage the preparer to \\"consider\\" adding a pinch more salt. The sauce was liscio, full of flavor and evident it was prepared from scratch and simmered over low heat. I did not, however, find the mozzarella spectacular....it was your standard but good nonetheless. I was expecting a \\"wow moment\\" as it's in the name of the restaurant. \\n\\nThe ambiance, service and food are a SOLID 9. If you're in the Orlando/Lake Mary/Altamonte Springs area make it a priority to visit Antica's and if you're 30+ minutes away....well, hop in your car and make the drive. It's well worth it. \\n\\nPS - I was told i gnocchi are the best dish on the menu. I hope you get to experience Antico's and let me know how you liked it when you do!!

After looking at some places on Yelp, we decided on Busy Bee. \\n\\nWe visited on a weekday morning, arriving exactly at 11:05 (five minutes after published opening time). We parked in the side lot, which already had some cars (probably the employees, in retrospect). Their doors were still locked but were quickly opened once we attempted to open them. Not a huge deal for us. \\n\\nThe restaurant is pretty small, with some booths, tables, and a bar. Decor is minimal, but there are lots of autographs and photos of famous people who have visited, like Jay-Z and OutKast. \\n\\nAlthough we were the first in the restaurant, the place quickly filled up within 30 minutes. We got some rolls and cornbread as starters. After perusing the menu, both my friend and I got their famous fried chicken and iced tea. She had potato salad and Mac & cheese as sides, and I got fried okra and yellow rice. They were still prepping some foods when we ordered, so the potato salad and yellow rice came out later than the other food, but it didn't matter to us because we were already enjoying the food that came out! \\n\\nOverall, the food was on the salty side, but that's to be expected with soul and southern food. The fried chicken was super juicy and flavorful. The fried okra was perfectly fried - golden brown and crunchy on the outside but not mushy on the inside. The yellow rice wasn't dry and was the most flavorful I have ever had. My friend said the mac and cheese was one of the best she has ever had, and the potato salad tasted fresh. I don't want to raise readers' expectations to unrealistic levels, but you won't regret visiting Busy Bee's. \\n\\nBy the time we left around 12:15 pm, there were people waiting inside and outside.

Wonderful southern style cooking. We started with warm toasted chiabatta bread with pimento spread. Then I had a nice dinner salad. For the main course, I shared a large yummy chicken fried steak with my husband, along with mashers and gravy. It was so good! My daughter had fried chicken for her main course, that was cooked with tasty spicing. The dessert menu looked fabulous, but we couldn't eat any more.

Fried chicken with sides of cornbread dressing and candied yams. Peach cobbler for dessert. The fried chicken has won awards as it should cause it's very tasty. Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Tastes like it's prepared with care. Sprinkle on some hot sauce and I couldn't put this chicken down. I get full fast so I saved what I didn't finish for later. Yams were sweet but not overbearingly so. The dressing was nice with the cranberry on the side. My meal also came with iced tea. I usually dislike iced tea but I enjoyed theirs. I later saw a worker literally dump a pitcher of sugar in the ice tea machine and that answered my question as to how I liked their iced tea. \\n\\nPeach Cobbler was also a winner.

We put in our orders after sitting for about 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, we finally got our food. It's not anything the servers are doing wrong, I don't think. They were nice and helpful when things were requested. They just seemed way understaffed. If you have open and unclean tables yet there's a long wait out the door, perhaps its time to add another staff member.\\n\\nI ordered the big hit burrito, which includes pork sausage, mushrooms, greens, onions, basil pesto, garlic and some other things. Pros of this was that it was reasonably sized, and everything seemed to be spread out just fine. Downside was that it wasn't spectacular. First couple bites were good, but you get tired of it quick. There was overwhelming amount of extra virgin olive oil. My plate was basically covered in EVOO that dripped out of the burrito onto the plate. \\n\\nOne highlight of the brunch was the jam. I could eat that jam all day!! Regardless, I likely will not be coming back. There are way better brunch places in NE that has just as long or a shorter wait for better food.\\n\\nTIP: if you like hot sauce with your food, they do have more than tabasco sauce that's standard on the table.

Under Chef Bruno's leadership and direction, the current version of this restaurant just might stick around for awhile and become a tradition in the community. \\n\\nThe menu seeks to be adventurous its endeavor to re imagine American Cuisine. Millenia 106 uses some of the best ingredients from nearby farms and purveyors and highlights seasonal dishes with a simple but fun presentation. The bar selections are designed to compliment your meal with freshly crafted cocktails, carefully selected wines, and locally brewed beers.\\n\\nWhether you are taking a business lunch or having dinner with friends, the show kitchen is open and inviting. Chef Bruno made good use of the space and some of the extras from the time the restaurant was a buffet, like turning the buffet itself into a raw bar packed with ice to store up oysters and all kinds of fresh seafood. \\n\\nThere is plenty of seating in the dining room area that has a rustic design theme and laid back vibe throughout. You can also opt to sit at the Chef's Table to sit back and watch as Chef Bruno dazzles your senses with sights, sounds, and smells and enjoy special tastings of new dishes before they hit the menu. There is also a small patio area outside as well.\\n\\nCocktails are just as important as the food at Millenia 106 and the bar area is designed to showcase that. The Old Fashion is made with Old Overholt rye, sugar and angostura. Old Overholt is said to be one of America's oldest continually maintained whiskey's. The 106 Collins is made with Bombay dry gin, lemon, sugar and soda.\\n\\nRaw Oysters were served with a Watermelon Mignotte. These were fresh, \\nsavory and a tad sweet. The Crudo was made  with Scallops, avocado, cilantro, chillies and pickled onions for a light and refreshing appetizer.\\n\\nThis is how you do Charcuterie. Chef Bruno put together an amazing spread of house made pork rinds, chicken liver mousse, pickle du jour, sopressata, speck, ndujia, Point Reyes Bleu cheese, triple cream and toast. It was all superb.\\n\\nPortuguese Surf and Turf consists of a sou vide pork belly, collars, local shrimp, murro potatoes and an IPA broth. This is one of the best pork belly dishes I have have ever had, but the whole plate was exceptional.\\n\\nA whole striped bass was served with guasacaca sauce, murro potatoes fennel, beets and orange slices. The fish was very flaky and packed with flavor. Guasacaca sauce is a Venezuelan guacamole sauce.\\n\\nCobbler with fresh Florida strawberries, blueberries, lemon mascarpone ice cream and a fresh herb crust was the perfect sweet ending for dinner.\\n\\nFrom raw bar offerings, handcrafted pizzas, an elegantly made sandwich, or anything else you can choose at Millenia 106, Chef Bruno is sure to impress. Everything we had was nothing short of phenomenal. The cocktails were paired perfectly and were made with quality. Don't pass up an opportunity to stop by and see for yourself, this place has the potential to be one of Orlando's next great restaurants."},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Since discovering Mattie's in the Spring of 2016, it quickly became my favorite restaurant in Austin.

As we ordered our meal, I told the waiter that I had a tree nut allergy he made note and also said he had eaten every dish multiple times. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli which the description on the menu did not include any tree nut products and the waiter didn't mention anything. After waiting over and hour for food, all of the people at our table were served their entree except for me. The waiter then expressed there was an almond flour in the ravioli and would I like to order something else.  I am now the only person without a meal and now I have to order something else and make everyone else wait. \\n\\nIt took me waving down the waiter to come back and take my second order. He apologized for the inconvenience and offered me a free dessert (didn't matter that I'm also not a dessert person and had zero plan on ordering something else that would extend our stay) After waiting longer for my actual meal and keeping the other people at the table waiting, I received my pasta Bolognese (easiest and quickest thing I figured to order). The table then wanted to order dessert since we'd get a free one. \\n\\nWe order and once we get the bill at the end of the night, dessert has been charged (as well as a full sized portion of pasta someone had ordered instead of the half sized portion that was actually ordered - we didn't catch this the first look at the bill and we had now stayed 3 hours and no one had the stamina to fix yet another mistake). \\n\\nThe waiter took off the charged dessert but this whole experience was unacceptable. The almond flour ingredient in the pasta should 100% be mentioned on the menu, the waiter should've have told me once I ordered that there was a nut included or the chef should've told him so I could have reordered a meal and not let everyone else wait AND our bill should've been correct from the get go. \\n\\nThe real kicker is that my boyfriend was so appalled at the way our party was treated, he sent an email directly to Tuscan Kitchen to describe our experience to make sure they were aware and this wouldn't happen with any other customers.

This is NOT that kind of Mexican place. \\n\\nEverything we ordered was fresh, and unlike any Mexican food we've had. No canned and doctored up salsa; no plates of refried beans and instant rice. No cheese melted over the whole lot. \\n\\nFirst, we had watermelon margaritas, one of the day's specials. OH MOTHER OF GOD, I have lived! We got glasses of heavenly light fresh watermelon juice, lime,and tequila, lined with some sort of gorgeous savory spices plus a tad of sugar.  No syrupy margarita mix here, friends. \\n\\nThen the chips and salsa. Well, it wasn't really salsa. I don't know the proper name, but this dip was complex--maybe there were roasted tomatoes? I'm not really sure, but it was beautiful and I could tell it was home made. The chips were hot, light and crisp, as well. \\n\\nNext, we had a roasted corn appetizer. I don't even like corn! But I can't wait to get back and have more of this deliciousness. Again, savory flavors I've never tasted were mixed perfectly. \\n\\nAnd now the entrees. Conin's fish tacos were top notch: light, fresh, grilled white fish; lettuce; maybe a bit of onion? I'm not sure. On corn tortillas. I asked for no tomatoes, no cheese. I like my tacos that way. Again, there were light yet complex flavors I can't name, maybe spices on the fish? Also on my plate were a side of saut√©ed potatoes, onions and carrots; and pickled vegetables. These were not the average canned pickled veggies we usually get at Mexican joints. These were freshly peeled carrots, green beans, and cauliflower that tasted like Ivan's grandmother just made them. \\n\\nThe hubby had chicken enchiladas verde. Of course, I had to try a bite or two. They were filled with big hunks of roasted chicken--not your average shredded flavorless chicken filling. And not slathered with melted cheddar. He also had the potato-carrot side; and a dome of perfectly herby white rice.\\n\\nAs for service, Ivan the owner was gracious, cheerful and as attentive as we like. He told us that, since everything is fresh, Conin can accommodate people with food allergies, vegetarians, vegans, what-have-you. \\n\\nAs soon as we got home, we invited a friend to go back to Conin with us as soon as possible.

No peking ducks left, but was not a huge deal for us. A huge bonus about this spot is the free parking - just remember to ask the staff for a tag to put on your windshield when you check-in at the front. \\n\\nThis spot is at a prime waterfront location and naturally there is a hefty price tag on the menu. Frankly, I think this is a spot for good atmosphere and service, rather than good food. The staff were attentive as they were very on top of it when it came to table service. The ambience was calm and you could have conversations with your table without feeling like you had to compete with the noise around you, which is definitely not always the case at Chinese restaurants. \\n\\nThis spot serves northern Chinese cuisine, but I think they have taken a more refined twist to it. The dishes are all quite delicate looking, with nice dishware and clean presentation. Honestly, I did not find any of the dishes that particularly memorable. Some of the food was a little bland to my surprise. On the dishes I tried: \\n-bread with a bean paste spread was a complimentary starter, nothing special but definitely a nice touch \\n-green onion and peppercorn chicken was a little too dry\\n-deep fried yellowtail was fried well, could eat the fish whole, down to the head\\n-braised chilli and spring onion black cod in fish broth was quite a let down and not worth the price tag of $78. They were out of black cod, so they substituted with snapper. The fish was debone/sliced thinly and soaked in a clear broth of jalape√±o peppers and spring onion. This felt like more of a soup than actual entree. Flavours were alright, but portion size and substance just was not to par. \\n-pork belly sliders aka rou jia mo was probably my favourite. The meat filling was juicy and flavourful and the pita was crispy and chewy at the same time. Tasted just like the ones I had in Xi'An. The jalape√±o chilli on the side was a nice touch to give the mo some kick \\n-bian bian noodles were quite good, the portion size just a little small. We shared everything between the 4 of us and everyone pretty much only got a single strand of noodle, so I would not recommend this dish to share. \\n-stir fried green beans with eggplant was not a bad dish. I liked the crispy fried eggplant and the northern Chinese flavours were definitely there\\n\\nOverall, the food was not consistent. There were some good parts, but also lots of room for improvement if they want to pride themselves in being an upscale dining experience. With the service and atmosphere setting quite a high bar to start, the food was a bit underwhelming afterwards. Not sure if the peking duck would have changed the experience, so perhaps that might be something to try next time."},{"name":"Frites Fries With Benefits","address":"1011 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I know that this place would not be considered \\"traditional\\" poutine, but I love the variety of poutines that they have.

Simple yet amazing with flavor and texture.  The Imeruli Khachapuri is hard to explain, but it is basically a cheesy pastry of sorts.  Another rich and tasty item.  Unfortunately when we ordered the Lamb Khinkali dumplings, I think they were undercooked which was a disappointment as the flavor of the filling was very tasty, but he dumpling dough was what didn't make it from not being cooked properly.\\n\\nA must is the Borjomi to wash it down with.  It is a quintessential sparkling water from the country of Georgia that has supposed health benefits.  What ever it may be, it went well with the meal.  They also offer flights of the Georgian wines.  I can't say much as I really wasn't a fan of them, but was told by my Russian partner that they are the real deal.

Then we get waited on by the kitchen staff who tells us she is in training. Glad we were such an inconvenience. Make it to the grill. One guy working on the grill while the other guy mingles. No organization. Then they grab random bowls. Watched him skip me who was first out the the group throw number 12 on the grill then walk to the opposite side of the grill and help that lady. So I now have my food at 8:07....please tell me why my tiny bowl took another 15 minutes to cook. No engaging interaction like there used to be. I seriously can't believe how bad the service is here. It's gone downhill since the day they opened and I'm pretty sure this is the worst service I've had. Last birthday celebration we will have here.

Between the three of us, we had a glass of wine, two sangrias, a negroni, and a daily special cocktail which was a boulevardier variation with artichoke liqueur. All the drinks were good. I'd come back for cocktails. Most of the wines were on the pricier side, even with $1 off at happy hour. \\n\\nFor food, we shared the hummus, sliders and salt cod fritters from the happy hour menu. The hummus was great and had nice crunchy chickpeas as garnish, great for sharing as well. The sliders were a little on the spicy side but a nice little meal. The salt cod fritters were super salty. I liked that I could taste the fishiness of the cod, but it had me reaching over and over for water. The bocarones toast also had potential but was similarly too salty (and this is just tasting it without the fish). I think I'd stick mostly to drinks here with the occasional snack of hummus.

For $12 though, it kinda just makes you wish you bought pillsbury pizza dough and some cheese and made it at home for $3 bucks. \\n\\n   The dumplings where gigantic dough sacks, with a small little chunk of ground meat rattling around inside. No real sauce, just the clear meat juice from the chunk inside. No sauce ouside the dumpling either. Just some sprinkle of something to make it look seasoned, but not noticeably adding to the flavor of the dough whatsoever. If the dumpling came with some sort of sauce, either inside or outside, that would be maybe worth $5. Definitely not $8 though, either way.\\n\\n   Oh, well. I wasn't super pissed or anything.

The bartender was awesome and the caramel corn was a nice touch. Drinks are priced on the high side but use quality ingredients. \\n\\nDinner service was excellent. Our server knew the menu backwards and forwards. She was honest about the portion sizes and had some great recommendations based on what everyone asked her. The food was really good in general. The gruyere biscuits were just okay, very little cheese flavor at all. My wife had the steak frites and her steak came out overcooked. It was replaced almost immediately with a properly cooked steak. The truffled frites were so good! I had the pork porterhouse which was cooked nicely and accompanied by a pressed watermelon salad. The salad was complexly flavored and fantastic. We also had the salad with burrata, prosciutto and grilled peaches which was also very good albeit pricey at $15. This leads me to reason for the 4 star review. While the food was great, the price per portion is very high in my opinion. If you want bread you have to buy the biscuits. $16 for four tortellini? Additionally, while it may have just been me, there was an air of pretentiousness in the dining room. Substitutions are \\"respectfully declined\\" as per the menu. I understand that a chef may want you to not mess up his carefully thought out dish but certain ingredients can put a great dish off limits to your customers with food allergies other medical conditions. \\n\\nOverall, I would go back because the food really is good although it won't be often."},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for dessert with my husband. We are a young couple in our twenties. The atmosphere is really creepy. We came in and didn't really know what to do.

Everything is old and dated, reminds me of an old Halloween house. The water glasses are made of the same plastic my kids have at home. Water tasted bad and without any ice. Sugar container had something brown and dried on it (perhaps a brownie?) Our teapot had a huge chip in it (safety issue for kids). The dessert was ok-probably something I could make at home. My husband went upstairs to the bathroom. Apparently there is a fake torso in the restroom that you don't notice until you sit down to do your thing. I chose not to even go to the bathroom.

Boulder has been blessed by incredible chefs and the best back bar in Colorado. Way, way more to come - photos and reviews on the dishes we chose from each stall on both nights - but I was so excited about this place opening I had to grab the first review!!!\\n\\nWith week one in the books, this place is simply fantastic. The space is comfortable with tons of different ways to sit and enjoy - risers with pillows, 4-top tables, long family style tables with living-room armchairs, the bar with either high-backed chairs or flat-topped barstools, and an amazing rooftop that will be available come... summer weather. (Lies! It's available now, go enjoy those oysters before it's cold outside!)\\n\\nThe food stalls are ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. They are each run by a chef striking out on their own, some for the first time. It is humbling to interact with them, to love their food and be appreciated for it, to support their dreams and get to know them. We simply didn't have anything bad to say about any of the food. \\n\\nJacaranda is my absolute favorite - I knew from the first day I saw their advertisement on Instagram that would be the place I spend all my time; there is no way to a southern gal's heart faster than honest, honored ingredients and more than a little African flavor. This food tastes like home never did but should have, and that soulful satiety is hard to form into elegant words. Each bite of each dish is so full of balance, each flavor aspect so well represented, that it's simply a delight to go back for another bite, another dish... get your own, I'm not sharing anymore! It'll just kick up your heels that many of these dishes are vegetarian and gluten free as well. You won't miss meat at all here.\\n   - The Domoda, peanut lamb stew, is soooooo well balanced and tender without falling apart - warming but doesn't burn, plenty filling without feeling stuffed (even after trying *almost* EVERYTHING else). \\n   - Benne Toast is a sweet/savory, soft/crunchy delight with just enough flavor sparking off in different directions to keep you coming back for more zest and zazz bite after bite after WHERE DID IT GO???\\n   - Acara, well, I've simply never had anything like it. Go eat it, you won't be sorry. You're welcome.\\n\\nTierra is the other that keeps blowing my socks off: the carnitas taco was the singular best of 10+ dishes I sampled the first night, and the mushroom chorizo is a delectable kick in the face (it's spicy, y'all). Go eat tacos. \\n\\nNone of this is to say any of the other chefs are less worth their salt, just the sampling I have personally had. I'll be back many days to come and will edit this review accordingly as I wander.\\n\\nWhat I CAN tell you, without a doubt, is that this will become one of the best places in Boulder to marry the chef, the local farmer and the diner. That sounds silly, and sorry, I don't think any of the chefs are single, ladies and gents... but some of the sous chefs might be!"},{"name":"Basa Basa","address":"2333 NE Glisan","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm surprised by all of the hate from the previous reviews.

It's a lot of prep work and then the stink of fried oil haunts you forever!\\n\\nFor $14 I got the 10 wing big box and was actually full. I asked for 1/2 original flavor (sweet Korean ginger flavor -like my nickname) and 1/2 Ono (Thai lime cilantro). Yes, the batter was kind of thick but I liked it and saw it as an opportunity to carry more sauce. The mac salad lacked a certain pop and I've had better elsewhere, but Basa Basa didn't claim to be a Hawaiian restaurant. I'm just grateful that it came as a side!  Lastly, I liked having a mound of rice as a side; it's my preferred carb for balancing strong flavors. In short, come here for a different interpretation of the chicken wing."},{"name":"Kanji Ramen","address":"12636 Research Blvd, Ste C101","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm torn between giving this 3 or 2 stars.

Nothing special. \\nMy boyfriend ordered the Kanji, which came out very quickly - before we finished the gyoza. The soup was warm. Like it was stuck in the microwave for a minute. But the broth tasted ok, and so did the egg. Everything else in the bowl was not. Noodles were undercooked. Meat was dry, almost jerky like. Corn was old mushy. Bok choy was slightly brown. Of course he didn't say anything to me until after we left, because he feels bad for sending back food. I'm thinking, the food isn't normally like this since mine wasn't nearly as bad. \\nMy bowl came out a few minutes after his. I ordered the Tonkotsu The broth tasted pretty standard, so again nothing mind blowing, but not bad either. We both agreed it tasted better than the Kanji. The soup was also warm. I would've liked for it to be hot. Noodles were nice and springy, marinated egg was ok, wood ear mushrooms were good. Not enough meat. The char siu slices were 2 2in slices of fatty pork belly.

But I have eaten at Blue Sage 3 times--twice for lunch and once for dinner, and once at the West Linn location and twice at the newer one in Lake Oswego. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend the Vegetarian Sampler, the Mac & Cheese, and the Chicken Chile Chowder. However, the grilled salmon I had for dinner was almost unbearably salty, and while my dining companion ordered his ahi seared rare, it arrived quite well-done. I would also definitely skip the crab cakes. That said, the good food here is really quite good, and the cornbreads & jalapeno butter are delicious as well. \\n\\nHowever, I absolutely DETEST the service style. It works all right for lunch, particularly if you're a businessperson or someone out running errands who wants food fast, but of a far better quality than one would get at most fast-food or takeout places. Oddly enough, though, the locations they've chosen aren't anywhere near any business areas, and the majority of people I've seen eating there are moms out running errands and elderly people having social lunches, which is also odd considering that they cater to families, but whatever.\\n\\nSo while the service style is all right, albeit a little annoying, at lunch, at dinner most people would rather ponder the menu, relax, converse with their companions, and have their order taken at their leisure. My dining party awkwardly dithered over the menu on the couch at the front of the restaurant for a while before deciding to order a starter and decide on our entrees at the table. Once we had decided, we had to walk back up to the front desk to make our order--incredibly inconvenient. I'm not surprised there were only two other parties in the whole restaurant. \\n\\nI think that if Blue Sage is determined to stick to their bizarre service concept, they should at least restrict it to the breakfast and lunch hours, and allow diners a more leisurely, traditional service at dinner."},{"name":"Sushi Katana","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic food and even better service.

The cold brew was smooth and was perfectly complimented by Patron XO, which tastes more like espresso than tequila. Be forewarned, it is a boozy drink that goes down way too smoothly.\\n\\nOverall the drinks were delicious, the service was wonderful, and the lounge was beautiful.

I was told that it would take twenty minutes to prepare my order. It actually took closer to an hour and a half. I waited while a couple of dine in customers were served and multiple takeout customers came in, placed and received their orders and left. My daughter even took a nap.

I was pleasant the whole time and she thanked me for my patience. The problem arose when I got home and realized that I had not been given the sides that came with the combo or the extras that I ordered, and went immediately back to the restaurant. Upon seeing me, she motioned for me to come to the front. I politely told her what I was missing and her whole demeanor changed at that point. Even though I had spent $30 plus dollars and an hour and a half there, she wasn't willing to give me the the hushpuppies, onion rings, and coleslaw she had left out.

The almonds provided little nuggets of dense crunch. The celery aioli was just the right amount of creamy that never felt overwhelming. The spicy sharp freshness of the celery was a beautiful idea. The fermented Chile rojo was like a beast on a leash. It attacked the forefront every now and then, but minded itself once everything came together. The tostada was a lovely, coarse crunch that made it feel like a crab was shuffling on top of a rock on the beach shore.\\n\\nThe governator taquitos were not fried to a traditional crisp. Rather they were like mini fried tacos. The shrimp almost had a chicken like texture (and even taste with everything). By itself it did taste like a mild shrimp. The cheese was lovely in its stringy, salty gooiness. The tortilla did add some pepper taste, although it wasn't pronounced. The salsa on the side added some acidic zest.\\n\\nThe lamb barbacoa was not really what I expected, but it was still a delight to eat. I love the portion size for this, even if it's a bit pricy. By no means should you think you're getting a family size portion. The amount of meat they serve fits within the confines of a banana leaf. The meat was primarily lean, yet still moist. I would have liked to see more fatty pieces thrown in the mix, but that's my personal preference. The house made tortillas truly elevate this meal from great to amazing. They have the stone ground corn taste I would desire from homemade, yet still have a delicate, consistent texture that holds up. The pickled veggies are a nice touch, but make sure to ration them for every taco. They offer three sauces, with the tarragon salsa being the best flavor. Its definitely a strong flavor, but I think that's why it works. The sesame habanero sounds great on paper, but its too weak to excite the tongue. The spice level is like a watery tabasco. The mint yogurt is kinda in the middle, where its got more flavor than the sesame one, but not enough compared to the tarragon salsa. This one works best for adding moisture and a level of freshness, but that's it. The bacon bean puree is dangerously delicious. I could have eaten a barrel of those beans. Such a rich, meaty, smoky profile that really hits home the use of smoke in this meal. \\n\\nThe blondie was a savory, yet sweet marvel. The squash ice cream definitely had that root vegetable taste, but clean. The corn masa brownie was the true delight of this meal. It was a great mixture of what I would want from a blondie, but still what I would expect from masa. The cajete was not as integrated as I would have wished, but it was present, it created a lovely, complex depth to the very light, sweet profile.\\n\\nI like the vision of this chef. They made it fancy enough to justify the prices and presentation, but left it super casual. Among the fog of tex-mex and breakfast taco, this places shines as a beacon of Latin inspired cuisine.

We finished off with an order of mango sticky rice. \\n\\nThe chicken wings were fried perfectly, just the right amount of crisp and the meat inside was still juicy. It was served with sweet Thai chili sauce which it paired very well with. Hard to mess up basic chicken wings in my opinion. My only complaint is the wings were on the small side. \\n\\nThe spring rolls were your standard spring rolls. They were crispy and the filling was flavorful. Not much more to say. \\n\\nThe pad Thai was okay; decent but definitely not the best I've had. I found it a little sweet and for some reason it was stickier than I'm used to. Not a bad dish though. \\n\\nThe pad see ew was much better. We ordered beef pad see ew and it was definitely loaded with beef. The noodles were cooked well and overall very flavorful. I'd get this over the pad Thai. \\n\\nFried rice was also good and filled with meat and vegetables. The tofu and mixed vegetables were good but I think the tofu was overpowering. I could've done with a little less sauce. \\n\\nThe mango sticky rice was a nice way to top off the meal. Nice and sweet. \\n\\nOverall a solid place for Thai. The service was friendly. The place was clean. Not much more to ask for."},{"name":"Granny's Tacos","address":"1401 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Was looking for a good taco lunch on the East side and came upon Granny's here on Yelp.

For my 8-piece roll I got the tuna and avocado roll and it came with a red sauce drizzled on top, which I could've done without and the roll itself was mediocre - the tuna didn't look or taste fresh and the avocado wasn't much better. I had to load up on the soy sauce to eat it. The sake that we ordered with our meal was forgotten and 3/4 into our meal we reminded the waitress (who was really hard to flag down the entire time we were there) about it.

I know this is unfair comparison but it is the same chain from kyoto.. \\n\\nWe ordered a few items and I thought the tonkotsu soba was my favorite. The portion was smaller but the overall taste was delicious. This was basically a ramen except they used green tea soba. The float and the shaved ice came with soft serve on top. Ask for a mix of the matcha and hojicha for your float! You can try both flavours! The soft serve was very good as it was rich in tea flavour. I found the bottom section (the icy part) just ok and wasn't as rich in taste as I had anticipated. Lastly, we waited quite a long while for their famous souffl√© as it was baked fresh from the oven. It also wasn't what I had expected.

I didn't want to stress myself out by heading back to NW Austin during rush hour, so I decided to eat at Casa, and maybe catch a movie at Alamo.\\n\\nI was really thirsty when I walked into Casa, so I was very grateful to get a huge glass of iced tea.  I received no straw, and the ice kept getting in my way, so that was a problem, but I managed to down all of it.  Ran out of tea just as my first plate of food arrived, but I had no problem getting a much-needed refill.\\n\\nI ordered the Casa G's Numero Uno, which includes a crispy beef taco, two cheese enchiladas, chile con queso in a taco shell, rice and beans (and guacamole salad, which I nixed).  The taco was small, but wonderful.  One of the best tacos I've ever eaten.  Ten times better than a 1am drunken Taco Bell fiesta.  And the chile con queso was surprisingly good.  It wasn't Velveeta-y like I expected it would be, but rather creamy and rich.  I frankly don't know why the enchiladas, rice and beans did not come out with the other items.\\n\\nWhen I got my second plate, I was surprised at how small the enchiladas were.  I almost needed a microscope to see them.  About the sauce... I'm pretty sure I said this in my Chuy's review, but it's worth repeating here:  The sauce tasted like Chef Boyardee and some rancid tomatoes had a love child.  I tried to eat as much as I could, but my gag reflex finally kicked in, and that's when I had to call it quits on the enchiladas.\\n\\nThe rice was decent, but it's pretty hard to screw up rice, don'tcha think?  The refried bean paste, however, tasted like dirt and leaves.  Oh, you've never eaten dirt and leaves?  You didn't get beat up as a kid, did you?  Trust me, you don't want this refried mulch in your mouth.  Also, the bean paste really stuck in my throat.  Half a glass of tea it took to completely swallow one bite of refried yard clippings.\\n\\nThe food wasn't the only thing that got worse over time; service did, too.  I didn't see my waiter at all while I ate, yet I desperately needed a third refill, which I never got.  Took forever to get and pay my check.  I didn't really care since I had all kinds of time to spare, but it was still a bit annoying.\\n\\nOkay, when giving a job performance review, you're supposed to start off with something good, then talk about where the person needs improvement, and then end with something good, right?  Like a compliment sandwich?  Okay, something good... The salsa was sufficiently spicy.  It needs more chunks and taste in it (onions, peppers, etc), but it was spicy.\\n\\nDone."},{"name":"Dots Cafe","address":"2521 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Holy carp.

The gluten free crust needs a lot of work guys.

Velvet Taco is a Dallas-based mini-chain restaurant, serving tacos on house made tortillas, local craft beers, and house made margaritas. Everything we ate tasted so fresh! All of the sodas offered at Velvet Taco are made with pure cane sugar, rather than corn syrup, and two worthy side dishes and a delectable red velvet cake are also served. This is a funky and fast-casual taco joint. They aim to deliver a fresh take on the ubiquitous taco and they nailed it! Think over twenty different tacos, including globe-trotting varieties from shrimp and grits to spicy tikka chicken to Cuban pig. The menu is broken down by the type of protein or filling, and include, chicken, pork, beef, fish, egg, and vegetarian options. Tacos range in price from $3.50 to $6.75 each, and any taco can be modified to suit diners' tastes and dietary preferences, including a choice of corn or flour tortilla, or a lettuce wrap. Fillings are exceptionally flavorful and often spicy, and include crisp tikka chicken, fried paneer, fish n' chips, and grilled flank steak.The servers are more than willing to make recommendations, just ask. They have brunch-influenced tacos like the barbacoa brisket and egg frittata are served all day, along with a rotating taco special each week. Bonus: Vegetarians can dine without compromise. Velvet Taco offers three veggie tacos including hot and crisp tofu, fried paneer, and falafel.\\n\\nThe sides menu is small but mighty from its riff on elotes to fried egg-adorned crispy tots to a red curry coconut queso. Save room for the velvet cake for dessert.

About 5 years ago, I brought my daughter here, but haven't been back until today, when I came to meet with a work colleague. \\n\\nI had just eaten & had a coffee before our meeting, but my colleague ordered a latte (which came served in a huge bowl!). Not long after I joined her, a male employee in a plaid shirt (the owner, I think?) came to our table, and said to me, \\"You can pick up your order at the end of the bar.\\" I told him I hadn't ordered anything, and at that, he started yelling and cursing loudly about how \\"This place isn't a community center!\\", and that people couldn't just come in to sit/talk/use the internet; they needed to buy something. In fact, he was so angry that he was visibly shaking. He went to the back room to repeat his rant, went away for a moment, and then came back and yelled/swore again, including his concluding suggestion, \\"Go spend the rest of the day on Yelp, for all I care.\\" My colleague and I, as well as other patrons, were slackjawed. One table left. To ease her discomfort with the situation, my colleague bought another drink, and we continued our meeting.\\n\\nSo that's what happened. An hour or so after it happened, here are my thoughts:\\n\\n1. To the owner: I understand your business needs. You run a cafe, selling food/drink. To stay in business, to pay for the \\"$15/hour\\" you mentioned that you pay your employees, you need to sell that food/drink. A suggestion: For those of us who are new(er) to your establishment, it would help if you posted your policy clearly *on your door* (e.g., $2/3 minimum order per person required to sit at a table). That way, before we enter your space, we are clearly aware of your policy.\\n\\n2. To the owner: Yelling and swearing does not and will not earn good will or customer loyalty. In fact, it does the opposite. I am a parent to an 11 year old child, and based on the behavior I witnessed/experienced this morning, I will not be bringing her to your cafe again, for fear that she would be exposed to a repeat rant. Further, as a person (beyond being a parent), *I* don't want to be exposed to yelling/swearing. That experience left me feeling shaken, and even a bit threatened.\\n\\n3. As a neighborhood resident, I have always liked the IDEA of Palio: charming neighborhood cafe, smack in the middle of \\"Mayberry\\" Ladds Addition. I envisioned it as a welcoming, friendly place, with a cozy & convivial atmosphere and yummy vittles. I wanted to like it. Sadly, in EXECUTION, Palio fails.\\n\\n4. This morning, before meeting my colleague, I enjoyed a lovely visit at Oui Presse, a nearby coffee shop within walking distance of Palio. There couldn't be a greater contrast between these two businesses. With all the coffee shop/cafe options in Portland, I can definitively say that I will take my future coffee shop/cafe business to places that will treat me and other patrons with kindness, friendliness, and respect. Unfortunately, Palio will not be on my list."},{"name":"Century Bar","address":"930 SE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"BLT with home fries was SUPER TASTY, tots were tots, but that's not a bad thing, and sliders (bbq chicken, buffalo chicken, and beef).

Probably taken out of the freezer...and thawed for a bit too long.  Don't get the stuffed mushrooms.  Think TV dinner style hor' dourves.  \\n\\nOur entrees-\\n\\n1) Scallops with pesto angel hair pasta-  this dish was flavorful, but was a bit too much on the creamy/greasy side- so much so that my wife could not finish it, even though the portions weren't that big to begin with.  \\n\\n2) Linguine with Clams- this dish usually comes with chopped up clams, but since they ran out, they offered to give me clams in the shells with the pasta.  No problem for me.  I'm glad it turned out that way, because 'chopped clams' sounds like it would come from a can... They asked how spicy I wanted the white wine based tomato broth- I said 8/10.  They did a great job with the spiciness (just enough for my head to itch), and the dish tasted great.   \\n\\nFor the price, the entree portions were on the small side, which was a bit disappointing.

I was honestly surprised how nice the texture and flavor was! There was a glaze that combined the sweet and savory together perfectly. On the outside it was seared like a steak so it was delicious. The Spider Roll was very good as well. It had tempura shrimp that gave it a nice crunch and each bite was very flavorful.

There are one or two more gourmet options like Brie with raspberry and ham.  \\n\\nIt's hard to mess up a grilled cheese sandwich, and they  do the basics very well.  I stick to the standard type stuff, maybe adding tomato or bacon.  Every time I've ordered a more indulgent option, like chicken or pork, I find myself wishing I stuck to my tried and true basic version.   Not that there is anything particularly wrong with the more hearty options - but the ingredient quality is very standard fare pub.  For example the chicken seems like frozen Tyson nuggets.  The pulled pork is similar to the large tub of pulled pork you get at Sams club.  These items are certainly edible, as I said, nothing wrong....but so much potential if they were to have less options but of better quality. Less Sysco, more made from scratch would be so much better.  \\n\\nIn addition to a side of fries or salad option, every sandwich comes with a tomato soup dipper.  Again, the soup beckons to a can of Campbell's. But sometimes, a grilled American cheese with a side of Campbell's like soup is just what you want. \\n\\nAnd that's the appeal of this place.  It's a cozy neighborhood spot, within walking distance to homes.  There are a few tables inside and out   It manages to fit the role of neighborhood bar, with beers on tap, a long bar, and TV.

I also found it interesting that they do not offer to sweeten the flavored tea,  but instead if you want sweetened tea,  they give you part flavored tea, part sweet tea.

It was during the week and during lunch. I had high expectations since my co-workers had a lot of good to say about it, and it's a place with a good reputation; in fact, according to Andrew Zimmern, it's one of the few 'redeemable' places in Orlando *sarcasm*. \\n\\nThat all being said, I was under-whelmed. The space is nice inside, with a dark and cozy lodge vibe. The service was solid, but not as attentive and focused as other places such as Hillstone (which is a chain even). But what really struck the wrong chord for me was the food.\\n\\nI ordered the lamb pita on the lunch menu. First, I was expecting a freshly shaved or grilled lamb/beef mix, but instead the lamb was more like a sausage. Not quite what I expected, but interesting nonetheless. The flavor was really good. It did throw me off, since I was expecting more like shawarma/gyro meat style, but for what it was the flavor was delicious. The fried spiced chickpeas added a nice crunch, and the pickled onions were tasty. So, what is my complaint, you might ask. It's this: while the pita itself was nice and warm, the lamb sausage was cold! Maybe it was room temperature, but it certainly wasn't even warm! And so while I definitely enjoyed the flavors, the meal was ruined because of the cold temperature of the meat. It was very strange, especially considering the place wasn't even busy when we were there. My other minor complaint is that the fries are way too thin and they get cold in less than 2 minutes.  \\n\\nTo be fair, I didn't complain about the temperature of the meat to my server, mainly because I was with co-workers and didn't want to delay everyone's schedule. And so I can't speak to how management would have responded if I had complained. But in any case, for the reputation this place has and the price of the food ($17 I believe), I was definitely disappointed. I mean, to put it in perspective, I eat at Swine and Sons all the time, and their food never has this sort of problem! The food quality seems comparable between the two places, and yet Swine and Sons is a smaller operation and much cheaper. I expected more from Ravenous Pig.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the meat was tasty but cold. I didn't complain, so I didn't give management a chance to correct the mistake...but I shouldn't really have to, especially when we were one of like four tables eating there at the time. I'll definitely come back, because the flavors of what I got, and the rest of the menu, were great.

Please fix it!\\n\\nBy way of background, RH is a new, upscale, urban-style food hall. The space is narrow, but tall and deep. A bar sits in the center by the entrance, while four food stalls line either side behind (eight total). Each food stall is owned/run by a trained chef. Each stall has its own little kitchen, and each offers a different type of food, ranging from American to African to Mexican to French to ancient grains to pastries, etc. A very nice concept. And we love the lease payment plan. Instead of each stall having to pay a pre-set lease amount every month, it pays a fixed percentage of its income for each month. This is greatly beneficial to the food stalls, in that they pay less in slow months, and more in better months. And the owners of the hall have a vested interest in each stall doing well. An excellent arrangement, especially for the iffy restaurant industry.\\n\\nSo, we eagerly entered the venue. To set the scene, which is important for what follows, on this Friday night many of the seats were filled, people were eating, but not one customer actually stood at any of the eight counters. We started at the first counter. Picked up the menu, spent time perusing it, spent time looking at food being prepared. To the next counter, same leisurely perusal of the menu and stall. We circled around the hall, visiting all eight places, spending at least several minutes standing at the counter of each, verbally discussing tasty menu options, oohing and aahing a bit over some of the plated food itself, etc. At each place we were the only people standing at the counter. At each place at least one, and often two, three, or four employees were standing there behind the counter doing nothing. And not once, at any of the eight stalls, did a single employee acknowledge our existence. Not one. We visited every stall, and ended up leaving without ordering anything.\\n\\nIt was bizarre to the point of being funny. Customers standing at the counters, saying nice things to each other about the food... yet nothing. The employees completely ignoring the customers, very pointedly. Which was even more inexplicable because the food stalls are small, so these employees were standing about three feet away. None of them had the slightest interest in actually selling food. Which is especially odd given that each stall is surrounded by direct competitors.\\n\\nExamples. At Jacaranda four employees stood in a circle gossiping about another restaurant. At Petite Fleur two women heard us talking about buying a chocolate peanut butter bar, and yet neither said anything. At Folsom Foods several guys saw us pick up the menu, and then they turned away and started talking. But I really shouldn't single these places out, because all eight places offered the same experience. (In case you're wondering, we are nice looking people, who were dressed nicely on a Friday evening. Kinda RH's target customers.)\\n\\nI am going on at length because the complete absence of service in a service industry was beyond inexplicable. At any McDonald's counter, an employee will (almost) invariably say something to the effect of, hello, can I help you? But not at RH. If management doesn't fix this blatant disregard for customers, customers will stop appearing.\\n\\nAnd if I drill down a little further, it wasn't only the lack of service that was bothersome. It was as if any normal, basic human interactive instinct was absent. Dismissive rudeness to the depths of their being. \\n\\nMany other reviewers have talked about how high the prices are for the small portions, especially given the food hall venue, so I won't go into detail about that.\\n\\nFrom what we gather (though weren't able to experience), when ordering, a customer gives a phone number to the stall, and the stall texts the customer when the food is ready. The customer then returns to the counter to pick up the food. So, phone numbers have to be given to however many different stalls a person orders from, with different pickup times for each. Great data mining of phone numbers, without streamlining food delivery. And given that there are several floors of seating, a table of people might have to walk quite a ways, multiple times, to pick up orders. A bit of a clunky process.\\n\\nOverall, RH is a great concept, and one that we would love to support (and tried to do so). We wish it all the very best, and hope that management has a serious talk with its people, and streamlines food delivery."},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Service was slack at best.   Great concept, looked good on menu but took waaaay too long to get a waitress, find out soup of the day and get our food.  Maybe they were short staffed?  I'm always willing to hear the reasons.  The food was 'fair to middling' and I was unimpressed with The Impossible vegan burger.  The onion rings were good but not exceptional.  I ordered red wine and you can't really mess that up but there was definitely an uptick in beverage service so I felt it was more of a bar ready place. It is blatantly an Atlanta uniquely bold gay focused menu and t-shirts and attitude.  Very fun to visit and relax, people watch and enjoy but the imagery doesn't compensate for the lack of good service and yummy food.  I would be willing to try it again since, in all fairness, it was the 4th of July and probably was affected by staff/patronage.

In about 5 minutes, our table was ready. The restaurant was mainly empty, and we were seated on the other side of the hostess station, (separated by a wall) in a half booth, half chairs four top table. We had a nice view of the rest of the restaurant. \\n\\nOur waitress was along shortly, and took our drink orders. I had a very well done cocktail, although I do not see it on their online menu. We also ordered an appetizer of Cheese and Charcuterie Board and while the three cheeses and two cured meats, as well as some raisins still on the vine, and honeycomb. While everything was good, the portions were very meager for over $15. For our entrees, we all ended up ordering the Herb-Salt Seasoned Beef Tenderloin with various changes, (no mushrooms, no sauce, different done-ness requests). For the most part, all of our changes were honored, however, the person who asked for no sauce still received sauce. None of us saw any onions with the mushrooms topping our steaks, as described on the menu. The steaks were good, but not outstanding. We're from Texas, so we weren't expecting stand out steaks. The mashed potatoes, as well as all of the other sides were fantastic, though.\\n\\nOur waitress was mainly fantastic - going the extra mile for those with allergies and bringing gluten free bread - a wonderful treat for those who couldn't have regular rolls. We really loved that. We had no complaints until the very end when she forgot to take our 10% off for our Disney Chase card and was MIA until we waved someone else down to go find her. She did correct the mistake and apologize, but it was a mistake that shouldn't have happened. We spent about $200 on dinner, so that 10% made a pretty decent difference on our check. \\n\\nI feel that Yelp's 3.5 stars is really true for The Wave.

I ordered a bucket of Modelo for $16 (wanted Corona, but they were sold out). Obviously with Modelo, we'd want some limes, so when I went to ask another bartender for some, she kind of had an attitude and when I told her \\"Thank You\\", she didn't say anything. Just sort of slid the limes in a cup and kept moving. At first, I thought they intended for their service to match their decor of the 50's by being racist towards people of color, but turns out, this lady was just sort of rude to everyone to several people in our group regardless of color. This was a turnoff as we were buying several drinks here. \\n\\nThe Bowling: Bowling was typical. The only thing that I didn't like were how badly chipped and beaten the bowling balls were.

I ordered the stuffed quail dish w/ included a chicken sausage stuffing w/ radishes among other things. It was cooked well and had a very pleasing taste. It's clear that thought was put into the combination of ingredients here. My wife enjoyed the Steak & frias plate. The steak was cooked beautifully. The \\"frias\\" on the side appears to be average-joe-hamburger-Shack-fries, but I was assured the were not....I personally didn't not taste any, so I'll have to believe it. We finished off the meal w/ a dessert called Pig Tails....a batch of fried cinnamon & sugar dough knots/sticks w/ a side of chocolate/espresso dipping sauce. The batter was more pleasing and somehow moist and flaky all at once. It was definitely tasty and the dip was the exact right touch to the dessert. The portion sizes were not extravagant, but they were adequate. The menu pricing is a little on the high-side but that was expected for the environment and reputation. I had high expectations for this restaurant and I expected to leave \\"wowed\\"; while the meal might not have met the \\"wow\\" factor, it was still an excellent meal that surpassed many other dining experiences.

It's a smaller place, almost missed it as we drove by. They have a good range of tacos and a few other dishes. Seems like they cook what they do well and really focus in on those options which I like. It was moderately busy while we were there and people kept coming in and out as we sat so they have customers.\\n\\nYou order at the front and then sit down. Kitchen is open and right off to one side so you can peek in and see what's going on, watch them plate everything and bring it over. Staff was friendly. Plenty of parking outside. \\n\\nCan't speak to authenticity or anything, but what we had was good. Beef taco was good, somewhat fast food chain tasting but a little fresher. Shrimp taco had a good portion of shrimp on it, nice flavoring. Carnitas was a little more lightly seasoned than I'm used to but very moist and decent. Carne asada was super cilantro-y and steak heavy so it wasn't my favorite but I know people that love that sort of thing. They have a grilled fish taco that, to me, was the best of all the ones we had. Just packed with flavor in those soft tortilla shells.\\n\\nWe also got the guacamole and the meals came with sides of salsa. The guacamole was good, a little lighter on the seasoning for it but that just keeps it light. The salsa was super runny but had all the flavor it needed to go with their chips. Don't know if they make them in house or not but they were light, crisp, and tasty.\\n\\nWas also in the mood for some horchata randomly and they have it. Very creamy and sweet with a strong bit of cinnamon to go with it. They didn't fill the cup all the way, just about three quarters and had plenty of ice in it which I just sort of chuckled over but left alone. \\n\\nOverall, it was 25 for six tacos, chips and salsa, and the horchata so I guess that's right in the ballpark of good pricing for a meal like this. Not sure if I would make the drive over, but if I'm in the area it would be worth a second visit."},{"name":"Au Comptoir","address":"2278 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Been here for brunch/lunch a couple times.

Unfortunately this came at a time of announcement to the addition of Starbucks locations being adding inside the theme parks and also at Disney Springs (Downtown Disney). This led to some confusion amongst guest, but those willing to grab a coffee in the resorts and some of the hidden jewels inside places like Disney's Animal Kingdom quickly learned that the coffee is good and sought out the specialty tea that seems to be even better. \\nWhen you walk into the nicely designed location at Disney Springs you are quickly greeted with a smile and an instant offering to try a couple of featured tea's.

If you are adventurous there are even some special adult style teas to help get your early drink on if you are so inclined. \\nThe pricing isn't horrible which is a nice surprise for a tourist driven area. \\nThe lack of my fifth star mainly comes from a few small observations relating to the condition of the shop on this last visit.

I'm talking about the Cedar plank cooked \\"Copper River Salmon*\\"  What's so special about it, you ask?  Well let me tell you.\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SArgfN2Q1YGoVG8A16tiRQ?select=mxztn54rT18JOQfsdYqhyQ\\n\\nIt's from Alaska and is only available 3-4 weeks out of the year (mid May to mid June).  It's also $48 a serving, normally priced at $37 for king salmon.  Comes with spring vegetables Orange-Soy Buerre Blanc and Parsley oil.  Our helpful server even gave us information about this popular salmon.  As an employee, they're not allowed to try it because they only have a limited supply of the salmon.  We felt sad for her, but kept eating anyway.\\n\\nFor apps we got the Smokey Portobello Soup with Roasted Shiitakes and Chive Oil, Braised Penn Cove Mussels with Fennel and Grilled Sourdough Toast, and the Crab cake.  They were all great, except the mussels.  For some reason only half of them were open.  \\n\\nYou should order it medium rare, because it taste best that way.  It's so buttery, it melts in your mouth.  I don't think there was any butter in this dish.  It comes out on a cedar plank and is plated at the table, a lovely display.  This is what you come for.  After tasting this piece of salmon, you'll forget everything else you just ate.\\n\\nI made the mistake of ordering the White Truffle gnocchi.  It was a good portioned serving (for me) and the 2nd best gnocchi I've had**.  The texture was there, but where was the white truffle?  I could barely taste it.  I secretly wished I got the salmon that every one else ordered.  For dessert we ordered 2 Valrhona Chocolate Terrines with Amarena Cherries and Salted Hazelnut Brittle.  The chocolate terrine was half good but the layer of dark chocolate was too hard and thick, it didn't melt in your mouth and go down easily.  I mostly ate the hazelnut brittle, which was the best part of dessert.\\n\\nService here is top notch, really helpful and checking that we were satisfied with everything.  The restaurant itself is open with high ceilings & windows and log wood cabin walls.  It didn't feel like a hunting lodge.  \\n\\nI'd definitely come back just for the salmon.  But if I don't make it on time, I'm putting the season on my Calendar.  Copper River Salmon, booked!  I'm going to find it at Whole Foods or Fresh Direct when it's in season.\\n\\n*Clicky on the linky for more info on the salmon.  http://gonw.about.com/od/fooddrink/a/copperriver.htm\\n\\n**The best Gnocci I've had was from Bottega in CA.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/bottega-ristorante-yountville-2#hrid:4_9ksUepM8VWWlPVbZel0w"},{"name":"Karl's Sausage Kitchen & European Market","address":"1 Bourbon St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4.5","text":"The cafe at Karl's is a best kept secret (or at least I hadn't discovered it until my birthday in March - quite a birthday gift!).

Fresh imported sausages, others made in the shop all served up alongside German staples including black forest ham and wiener schnitzel. Try the mouth watering pretzel and the draft beer. While I would not call this a date place (brushed iron seats and a glass display adjacent to the deli), this is definitely a destination restaurant that I can likely see becoming a necessary stop for Euro-foodies in the Boston area.

I pointed out where we were sitting. Ten minutes later, We still didn't have the food, so I went up, and again they were just sitting on the counter.

Only in Atlanta for the night! We arrived about 8pm, Monday June 17, 2019.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately. I was glad. Having been on the road for 12 hours that morning. I was starving.  Waited 20 minutes for a waitress. \\"Nita\\" Had to be new....... She wrote everything down word for word. \\n\\nShe took our drink order. I was told that the cherry limeade had no refills. When the menu clearly states that it does. ( I have a pic to verify) I ended up ordering water. Told my husband that there is no raspberry tea. (It's on menu) But she going to make him a mango tea. (Not on menu). What the wha?  My daughter ordered a sprite. And my mother wanted a hot tea but ended up ordering water with no ice. Took 15 minutes to get drinks......  Nita brought the drinks. She places the \\"cherry limeade\\" in front of me. And told me... .don't worry... I did not charge you for that drink! SMH  My husband got his drink, my daughter got her drink and then she gave my mother a water with ice. When she realized her error she apologized and walked away with the drink. Even after my mother said it was OK, and she could leave the drink.\\n\\nI gave my drink to my daughter, she had wanted a cherry limeade but chose not to order it after Nita was so rude about it. When Nita returned later to take the order she asked me. Why does she have your drink? Was there something wrong with it. I said, No. My daughter wanted it..... so I gave it to her. \\n\\nWe ordered the food. I got the my husband and I got the 2 for 14.99. I ordered ribs with whiskey bbq sauce, and the sirloin medium with the regular sides of mash potatoes and  broccoli.  My husband ordered the shrimp and dragon salmon with rice and fries. My daughter ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries. My mother settled for the dragon salmon meal which came with broccoli on steamed jasmine rice. And a side of onion rings.\\n\\nFood came 45 minutes later. In that time I saw other people leave after waiting for their drink orders that did not come. (The table in front of me left after 20 minutes) I asked Nita about our food at the 20 minute mark and she said she would check on it. She never came back and let us know how much longer. At this point I would have normally left. But since my mother was with us we waited.  Very impatiently..... Nita told us that we would get a 10% discount because of the long wait. \\n\\nNita arrived with my place. She placed it on the table in front of me. My first impression was EWWW. It did not look good. It looked rushed. And dried out.  She proceed to place my husband's food in front of my mother. I let her know that was my husband's plate. She brought my daughter her burger. And that was it........No meal for my mother.  She had to ask my mother what she ordered again. At that time I asked for utensils so that we may eat and  ranch for my daughter's french fries.  10 minutes she comes and tells us that there are no clean utensils and that we can either use plastic once or wait until they clean more. We opted to wait for real utensils.  15 minutes later the utensils came. And my mother's food came 5 minutes after that! SMH My mother's meal was suppose to have broccoli and jasmine rice. Yet it had mash potatoes. So I asked for her jasmine rice and once again for ranch for my daughter. We still have not eaten and the plates have been on our table for 25 minutes. My husband had eaten his french fries but that was it.  Nita said she was going to bring us some chips and salsa. \\n\\nMy ribs were rough and chewy. My steak looked like someone had cut half of it and given it to me like an afterthought. The steak was cooked well done! No red what so ever. The mash potatoes was barely a spoon worth.  She finally arrived with the ranch and refill of drinks for the glasses that had been empty for over 30 minutes. My daughter finally started her meal.  I did not eat anything but a bite of the ribs and the broccoli. The broccoli was delicious.  I asked for 2 small boxes. My daughter took her burger home and my mother her onion rings. Nita brought the chips and salsa.  I ate a couple chips and tried the salsa. \\n\\nNita brought the check. And proceeded to stand there like she was waiting for the money immediately! SMH In my 20+ years of being an adult I have never had a waitress stand in my face and wait for the money when you got the check. Needless to say I checked over the bill. No discount. She did not charge for my drink but the other 2.  We paid the bill. My mother left a $5 tips. I refused to leave anything. I normally tip well over 25%. \\n\\nWe left the restaurant and I had to google fast food so I could get something to eat. I ended up at Wendy's and got a 4 for $4 and a frosty for my husband. When I got to my hotel room I finally was able to feel fed. \\n\\nWe visit the Atlanta area fairly regularly.

It was like kai lan soup, and the sauce was flavourless. I actually ended up adding sauces to the dish at home because I didn't want to waste the food. The kung po chicken dish was filled with cheap filler vegetables and wasn't even a little bit spicy. It was really disappointing all around. Finally, there was a PIECE OF HARD PLASTIC in my food!

I asked if the table was reserved or if we could deal with it should the need arise... it wasn't reserved.

It was a short 10-15 min walk from our Air B&B to Tin Shed--it was less than 40 degrees that morning, so I was really hoping breakfast would be worth it. AND IT WAS. We got there around 9 and there was already a pretty hefty crowd waiting outside. Fortunately, most of these people had adorable dogs and there is coffee you can grab while you wait. The wait was probably 20-30 minutes, but amongst the throng of dogs were an adorable husky and corgi so the time passed quickly. We sat at the bar in order to be seated quicker.\\n\\nLike most Portland establishments, they're super gluten-free friendly here, everything is clearly labeled, and they have gluten free toast and other options. That and they have a ton of boozy coffees. But, having almost been killed by tequila the night prior, we skipped that. The boyfriend got the Good Dog Stack over cheese grits--it had salsa, chipotle aioli, and jalapenos on it so it was pretty much a shoe in. I got the Salm I Am scramble which comes with potato pancakes or cheese grits OR A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH. Of course I got a little of both. It was simply delicious. The grits and potato pancake were just as good as the scramble, which was amazing. The potato pancake was super crispy, because sad, soggy potato pancakes are just unacceptable.

By \\"smelly,\\" by the way, I don't mean gas or skunk or sewage or anything horrible. I just mean fast food. You can sit by the fireplace or at a counter-height table by the window or on the bench with the many outlets and focus your gaze toward the cafe area, but that smell will always be there, reminding you that this room is shared with the home of the five-dollar footlong (and if you're *really* lucky, you won't be able to get the jingle out of your head while you're there).\\n\\nThis setup also makes it one of the most enigmatic coffeehouses I've been to, a characteristic bolstered by its very name. \\"Urban\\" Coffee could only be less urban if there were a cow pasture across the street.\\n\\nSomehow, these quirks are appealing, though. I like the place on the whole, least of all because the wifi is reliable, the staff is pleasant, and the space is very, very quiet. Of all the places I have on my rotation for getting work done at, this is one of the easiest to concentrate at. And it somehow does manage to have atmosphere (even if it's an atmosphere reeking of cold cuts).\\n\\nI do kind of understand why the arrangement. I'm fairly certain I was here ten years ago and don't remember there being a Subway there yet (or I could be totally making that memory up), suggesting that the Subway was franchised in an effort for the coffeehouse to stay afloat. Many coffeehouses serve ready-made sandwiches and other light fixings, so why not cut a few corners by working with a company that already does that? That's my theory, I haven't done research. It would be a small sacrifice, and anyway, if you come for the sandwich and stay for the coffee and tea, you can't possibly be disappointed.\\n\\n[Edited to note: I see that there is a business blurb that says Urban Coffee opened in 2008, so I guess my memory from \\"ten years ago\\" is indeed a fabrication, unless there was something else in the space or nearby. Oh, also, this pic that has been the location's main picture for a while, with the long table in a close-walled room? That must be the meeting room because the cafe area looks nothing like it.]"},{"name":"Hunan Bistro","address":"10700 Anderson Mill Rd, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Worst service ever!

GOODNESS. The eggplant was savory and satisfying, it has a tomato base and very delicious. Our appetizers came with a complimentary esme (turkish vegetable spread) that was fantastic: creamy, a bit of crunch, refreshing, did I say creamy? The lavas was hot and puffed up perfectly. \\n\\nSidenote: The ambience here is great. We enjoyed every minute we were there. Decorations were fun to look at and the service was wonderful.\\n\\nMain dishes: I had the Lamb Sis Kabob and my fiance had the Special Beyti Kabob (also lamb). Y'ALL! The lamb. The. Lamb! I don't know anything about butcher stuff but if lamb had a filet mignon, this was it. The best of the best: savory, soft, tangy, like if you're a carnivore and your mouth had a daydream it would think about this. The rice was the best rice I've ever had in a restaurant, we ordered seconds of just that. \\n\\nDessert: We were so stoked on our whole experience already we splurged and ordered two desserts - baklava and the kunife. The baklava was the perfect amount of sweet, super fresh, and warm. So, so good. I've never had kunife before but I think I'm more of a baklava girl. My fiance loved the kunife and we had to purposely make a point to not finish it all because by now we had three appetizers, a main course, and two desserts.

I'm of Indian heritage. \\n\\nFor those who don't want to read the whole diatribe, know this, the food at Vijs is terrible. Yes terrible. Go somewhere else for Indian food. \\n\\nJust went to Vijs tonight. Visiting from Toronto. If this is the best Indian food Vancouver has to offer, then that's a very sad statement. (But I'm willing to bet there are little cheap hole in the wall places in Surrey that taste way better than this poor attempt at Vijs.)\\n\\nWe were greeted by an unfriendly FBI agent who allowed us to go to the rooftop patio. We arrived at a lovely rooftop patio. Quite nice looking. The servers upstairs were warm and friendly with a nice casual sensibility. \\n\\nWe ordered mango lassi, the mushroom appetizer and the eggplant appetizer. And I had the saag paneer with daal as my main. \\n\\nThe mango lassi tasted like it was made with a chalky yogurt and old tinned mangos. A definite alkaline chalky taste making it an unenjoyable lassi. Hey Vij, try it with fresh mango and a homemade yogurt and a hint of fresh cracked cardamom and a bit of ice. It'll work out better. (Vij touched me on the shoulder while I was eating so I figure I can speak with him directly now.)\\n\\nThe eggplant dish was ok but tasted like something I'd get on the Greek island of Santorini. So if you're looking for Greek flavours you've found it. If you're looking for delicious Indian food, this isn't it. \\n\\nThe mushroom appetizer dish... well let me just say I would be completely shocked if I ran into the kitchen and didn't see piles and piles of empty Campbell mushroom soup tins. It was indistinguishable from Campbell's mushroom soup. If you like Campbell's mushroom soup you will like this dish. If you want something tasty you will not like this dish. I found it inedible. \\n\\nThe saag paneer... Flavourless/bland. Saag paneer is normally a delightful dish. A bright dish. Full of notes of ginger, mustard seed, garlic and fresh rapini or spinach. This had none of that. It tasted bland. Also the half portion for $16 or $18 comes with half a chapati. What do they do with the other half? Throw it away? If you're paying $16 at least you should get the other half of the chapati.\\n\\nThe daal was ok. Not great. Just ok. \\n\\nThe naan was ok. Not great. Just ok. \\n\\nMaybe in the past this place was great. I think Vij you should spend less time greeting people and more time tasting things before they leave your kitchen.  (Vij was sitting at the table behind me eating food for most of the time I was there so maybe without him in the kitchen it all goes to hell, but a high priced restaurant like this should be able to churn out excellent food even if he isn't in the kitchen.) This was honestly the worst Indian meal I've ever had in 47 years. \\n\\nColossally disappointing. And I went in with low expectations to begin with. \\n\\nOn top of all that it was expensive. If you're going to charge a lot of money Vij, at least make it tasty. \\n\\nAvoid.\\n\\n(If you make the mistake of going here, know this, you can salvage the night by going a block down the road to the BierCraft Bistro and get the sticky toffee pudding. That is the best thing about Vijs. There's a good dessert to be had down the road.)\\n\\nUpdate: Vij reaches out to me to \\"discuss\\" my review and winds up insulting me by making reference to my mother and says \\"maybe you're use to your mommy's lassi\\". Judge for yourself if you want to give your money to a guy who insults customers and the customer's mother. Ask if that is the behaviour of a person with class. Perhaps focusing on improving his food would be a better avenue to pursue.\\n\\n\\"I was cooking French food,\\" Mr. Vij says. \\"I never ever [formally] learned to cook Indian food.\\" - https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/careers-leadership/culinary-kingpin-vikram-vij-brings-bollywood-to-restaurant-empire/article22998466/  Perhaps this explains why his Indian food doesn't taste good to me, he seems to say he has never ever [formally] learned to cook Indian food in that Globe and Mail article. Perhaps he should.\\n\\nHis full comment to me by Yelp message regarding the lassi...\\n\\n\\"Mango Lassi all over the world are made with Canned Alphanso Mangos because you cannot get fresh mangos to be sweet and their is Mango hair that comes in your mouth, I would need to have one person, getting paid good wages to make a Lassi as you have described and your lassi would have costed 15 dollars and I do not think, most people would pay that much for a mango lassi, yes, cardomom and rose water was added to it.

My parents are Colombian so I've grown up with the food and flavors all my life and this is by far the closest it gets to a home cooked meal for me. I've been coming here for YEARS and it's consistently delicious. Here's what to expect and my recommendations:\\n\\nLos Guidrys Thoughts and Recommendations:\\n- Come on the weekends if you can! Most Colombians restaurants will have special items on the menu that you can only order on the weekends or Sunday and those are usually the best. The Sancocho de Gallina or de Res are my go-to's if I'm here on a Sunday. My mom loves getting el Mondogo or Ajiaco (We love good hearty soups)\\n- If you're not a soup person like us or just didn't come here on the weekend, you can't go wrong with the Bandeja Paisa. Now, for a first timer this dish can be overwhelming because it comes with so much food! Just be prepared to either be super stuffed or asking for a to-go box. They do have a \\"Mini Bandeja Paisa\\" but there's nothing mini about it. Still a lot of food! I also love getting an Arepa with toppings.  You can't go wrong with an Arepa Mixta where you can choose 3 toppings. I recommend getting the chicken, shredded beef and sausage.\\n- Natural juices! My favorites are the Lulo and the Maracuya and I always get them in water ( milk is the alternative but that's too heavy for me). \\n- The service is great every time! I don't think I've ever had a bad service experience here. Maybe a long wait to get my food on a busy day but that's it.\\n\\nThere's always room for improvement in my opinion but I'm not sure how feasible it actually is 1) Parking can be a struggle. There's a small lot and the spaces are tight. You have to be very careful not to hit another parked car. 2) Dated interior and exterior. After so many years I think it's fair to say La Casona needs a little refresh. A fresh coat of paint, some modern light fixtures, updated TVs, remove the old news stands that just sit in the front... just to name a few things. \\n\\nOverall, this place will forever be one of my favorites. I highly recommend you coming here for lunch or dinner.

It's a mom & pop style spot at the end of a flea market style joint but just follow your nose (lol)! Upon entering, I have always been greeted by a warm hello and a mouth-watering aroma of well blended herbs and spices. It's really quite amazing! The customer service is superb too. I've only interacted with the ladies but they've been very personable; smiling and holding conversation so you don't really feel like a stranger. If you're not sure what to order, small samples are allowed. The portions are very large. I usually have enough for 3 individual meals when I order the large meal. So far, I have tried the jerk chicken, jerk shrimp, jerk pork ribs, jerk oxtail, festival, plantains, cabbage, & rice & beans. Everything is FANTASTIC but my personal favorite is the jerk chicken, jerk shrimp, and cabbage. I am one who finds a favorite and sticks with it forever but I am very confident in their recipes and have ventured out to try other items offered on their menu as well. The jerk shrimp is the spiciest to me; followed by the the chicken, oxtails, & ribs. I have also introduced my co-workers to the spot and they LOVE IT too! So far I have added 4 fans to list. \\n\\nLunch specials are available. I believe drinks all come separate. Food receipts are emailed or texted to you. They accept cash/credit. There is available seating with reggae music playing in the background. Parking is also available for free next to the building and pay on the street. They partner with Grubhub, Uber Eats, & 1 other company if you want delivery.\\n\\nLong story short, you really have to try it for yourself. You can't go wrong with whatever you select because everything is so delicious!"},{"name":"Something Fishy","address":"2107 A E Semoran Blvd","city":"Apopka","stars":"4.5","text":"Went there last Friday...was great!

The 2 pieces of bacon were almost raw and went untouched.  They charged over 13 dollars for this mess but since I never saw my waitress again I could not explain.

Topped with warm maple syrup, vanilla sour cream and preserved pears, they definitely are giving Medina's some competition. \\n\\nI knew that I was truly starting to fall in love with other touches throughout the space.They've really thought things through: tables with hooks in the centre for purses,  bathroom stalls have two hooks with \\"purse\\" and \\"jacket\\" photo frames, our water constantly filled and the billfold was crested with the Corner Suite logo, instead of the standard Visa jackets you see so often. \\n\\nMais attendez il ya plus (means something like \\"but wait, there's more,\\" thanks google translator) Corner Suite has not only raised the bar high for foodies, but behind the bar is a range of spirits set to impress. Steve Da Cruz saw us looking up at the bar and came over to ask if we had any questions about the spirits - another great touch. I can already feel those plump bar stools tempting me back for a caesar (with a bacon wrapped quail's egg). Perhaps I'll sample the cocktail list while testing out their 24/7, kitchen special, which looks like it costs $24 and 7cents."},{"name":"Porcinis Italian Restaurant","address":"68 School St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"I really can't say enough good things about this place.

The hotel is huge and very pretty. My room (a standard with one king sized bed) was spacious and relaxing. The conference accommodations were good but very spread out because it's a big place. I got a manicure at the spa and it was lovely! Even though the place is huge and filled with lots of people, it didn't take long to get in the elevators.\\n\\nMy only issues were small: housekeeping was inconsistent. One day they came to my room at 9 or 10 am. The next day, they still hadn't come by around 5 pm, when I returned to take a break between sessions. Because I only had an hour between the sessions, I had to put the do not disturb sign up and my room didn't get cleaned that day. The next day I requested new sheets and they only replaced the top one (I could tell because a tiny stain was on one of the bottom sheets and it was still there). When I spoke to a staff member at the front desk, she made it seem like it was my fault. \\n\\nAlso, the food for the conference was not great. I normally find something to eat at most places, but there were several meals when I had to go to one of the markets or other restaurants on the property to find something edible. At our banquet, the only thing I ate out of a four course meal was the chicken in the main course.  The set up was confusing too.

According to Groupon, Mr. Carroll's claim that he didn't authorize an extension is bogus, it was in the fine print of his contract. Groupon's rep had never before experienced a merchant refusing to honor a valid groupon under these circumstances.\\n\\nLet me preface this experience by saying that our family doesn't dine out much. 1st reason: it's expensive. 2nd reason: it's stressful dining with two young kids. But about 4 times a year, we try and enjoy letting someone else cook for the night. So tonight we treated ourselves to try out a Medford square landmark, Carroll's. I bought a great groupon and this was our night to enjoy the sights of the holiday season as a family. Everything seemed routine at first, we showed our server our groupon, we ordered, we ate. When it came time to pay, feeling grateful that we could afford this opportunity thanks to groupon, I handed the voucher to restaurant owner, Maury Carroll, who to my surprise, refused to honor the promotional amount. He claimed the promo period had expired. The expiration was clearly visible on the voucher and showed a valid date! Maury explained that groupon had extended the expiration date without his consent and so he was not obligated to honor the promotional value. The place was empty except for maybe 4 tables and this guy Maury is talking to us like we're trying to steal from him. He treated us extremely rudely and when I voiced that he was putting a $25 profit above treating his customers fairly by honoring the agreement he himself had made with groupon, he walked away and his general manager, Ashley asked us to leave. Ashley talked about how the restaurant loses money on groupons...but how is that a customer's problem? We never would have thought that Carroll's would use groupon to lure customers under false pretense, only to demand full price after they finish their meal. I understand that this is an internal matter between the business owner and groupon, but to humiliate and disrespect a paying customer is over the top for a business owner. Adding insult to injury the food was mediocre and overly priced! This place sucks! The only positive was our server, she was nice and I think completely shocked at how her boss came out spewing hostility at the people she was helping.

I had my doubts because on one rainy night I took some of my friends there thinking that the word \\"Tavern\\" meant cheap-with-beer, but unfortunately the place had dark lights and about a thousand yuppies with wine. However, after glimpsing the menu, I decided to give it try when I was less-drowned-rat-and more \\"young professional.\\" \\n\\nLast night, my boyfriend and I gave it a try and I have to say I was extremely impressed. The restaurant is kind of small--oak tables, simple overhead lights that are dimmed considerably around 8pm, a full, interesting wine list, a large beer and spirits collection without being college aged-nor overly polished or pretentious. It is also located directly across the St. Mary's T-stop (Major plus!) and has outside dining (which was always full on summer nights since it opened--though it was very bare last night when I went since it was colder.) Our waiter was calm, somewhat laid back--but not overly laid-back--it was sort of a nice middle between an over-the-top place like Flemmings and a super laid-back restaurant like Sunset-Grille. \\n\\nI remember thinking that this is the sort of place you come to when you're a yuppie who has outgrown the bar/pub crowd but want to enjoy the same joys of that lost time--just dressed up for your age. For example, my boyfriend and I ordered the whipped potatoes (Very, very tasty) and the Sweet Potatoe fries on the side (amazing) and the sweet potato fries come in this little white box and the silverware are wrapped with paper napkins rather than cloth---and I think these light touches really gave me the sort of feel you'd get from a place that wants you to feel more relaxed than you would at say, a nice steakhouse. \\n\\nThe food--well the food was actually extremely good. For starters I ordered Oysters (about $2.25 each). The Oysters were cold, plump, and very fresh---they came with two sauces: a sort of spicy pesto sauce and cocktail sauce. We also tried the crabcakes with avocado which were very good as well. These appetizers came out extremely quickly, too.\\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the sea scallops with asparagus and a horseradish sauce over whipped potatoes. Amazing. The Scallops were huge, fresh, prepared very well-my boyfriend tried the Prime Sirloin--outstanding. The dishes come as a symphony of tastes, not single instruments--and the ingredients couple very well together. I really felt like the single entree was very \\"complete,\\" if that makes sense. \\n\\nI wanted to touch on Erica's comment about no dessert or coffee. I didn't see any coffee on the menu, but on the right hand side of the menu I did see one option for dessert (I didn't try it)--a five layer choclate cake with ice cream. So, perhaps they've changed their tune about dessert. \\n\\nOverall, I had a very nice abeit surprising meal. I went on a Monday so the restaurant wasn't packed like it was when I peeked in on a Friday but for a Monday the restaurant was fairly full but still pretty quiet. \\n\\nI would definately eat here again when I had designs for some fresh surf or turf but didn't want the overly invovled waiters at a nicer, more refined restaurant. This is the sort of place that you can wear nice jeans and nice shirt to, casual but somewhat elegant. You will also end up spending money. I think our check came out to 89 dollars between us.

Signage is spot on. Check-in was smooth. All staff throughout my entire stay were friendly and professional. I was quite impressed with the level of customer service delivered to me in all areas of the hotel.\\n\\nThe room had floor to ceiling windows with terrific views of the surrounding area. The room was quite comfortable with a wet bar, mini refrigerator, quality bedding, huge TV and great lighting. Even when you place your feet on the ground from the bed a night light pops on. Bathroom had ample space for me and provided a TV embedded in the mirror. I loved this, as I could listen to the news in the morning as I dressed. Free wifi in the rooms, although sketchy. \\n\\nThe Regency Club Lounge benefits include daily continental breakfast, light snacks in the afternoon, evening hors d'oeuvres/cocktails and dessert. This was much better than I have experienced in other Concierge Lounge areas.\\n\\nWhat I found to be amazing with a resort of this size is that I was never left waiting for an elevator. It worked super fast. \\n\\nGym and spa quite lovely. Spinning classes offered. \\n\\nLarge nice pool area offering one slide that I saw. Well maintained area.  Coconuts  Poolside Bar and Grill is convenient.\\n\\nLots of other choices for restaurants on-site with a 24 hour dining option and 24 hour room service.

There was supposed to be another adjustment to the bill, which was never made. To top things off I had to say I was waiting on my change only to find out the bill was still incorrect and the bill was $20 higher than it should have been.

I had specifically booked the place hoping to try some of those dishes. We ended up splitting the pub burger and the shrimp and grits dish. I typically am not into grits but I will admit that the unique spin they put on the dish and the great mix of flavors had me enjoying it, although it was a small portion for the price, I realized it was just an appetizer.\\n\\nI split the pub burger with the hubby as well and it came with a huge beer cup of filled with truffled fries. The fries were pretty good and the burger was just Ok for me, nothing special.\\n\\nWe were down to our last funds the days prior to leaving so we unfortunately opted not to get dessert, although I kind of regret it now as it may have swayed my review by a star. The desserts were unique and hand prepared and honestly looked very good. \\n\\nOverall, the service was OK (our waiter wasn't particularly attentive though) and the food was OK, although I was just disappointed that certain items were no longer on the menu. Also, the reason for the 3 stars was I noted in the reservation that we were here to celebrate our anniversary/honeymoon in Florida and nothing was done to acknowledge this. It kind of beats the point of mentioning why you've traveled thousands of miles to dine here. If we're ever in the area again though, I might consider coming back here depending on what the menu for the week is and will most likely try the desserts.

The Carolina pork had a nice tangy-ness to it from marinating in their vinegar-based sauce, but ultimately seemed like leftovers from the weekend that had been reheated, and saturated in liquid smoke. The coleslaw...well, I ate it (I'll eat anything) - but it was basically these tiny dots of macerated cabbage and carrots with a slaw dressing from a gallon jug. The sauces on the table were actually pretty good - and the spicy BBQ sauce helped the experience.

Went to Shari's, on 185th, because it is only a couple of blocks from home & they are open 24/7.  We probably go to this Shari's about 4 times a month bu tnot usually late in the evening.  E got to the store at about 9:30 PM.  No one at the front to greet us, place wasn't really crowded, maybe 1/2 dozen tables occupied.  Were finally greeted, by manager(?).  we told her that we would prefer a table, rather than a booth.  She promptly led us to a booth.  We reminded her about our preference & she said \\"oh, that's right\\".  she seated us, gave us menus & took our drink order.  She came back a short while later to take our order.  I ordered the new chicken with blueberries salad & my wife ordered the chicken & dumplings.  Our server came back a few minutes later & told us that they were out of chicken & dumplings.  My wife then ordered the prime rib dip.  That's when things started, or didn't start, to happen.  After about 20 minutes, or so, I walked up to the front counter, where the manager(?) had just finished about a 10 minute conversation with a diner whi had just paid her bill.  I asked her if there was a problem with our order.  She said \\" There were about 20 people ahead of you... Oh, I see that it's just coming up now\\".  Well now took about another 10 minutes,  Another server brought my wife's order & asked if there was anything else.  I promptly told her that I was waiting for my salad.  She said \\"Oh, okay, I'll go take a look\\".  She promptly brought my salad to the table.  I asked her if I could get some type of bread, like focaccia, or something.  She offered to put an order in for  their flat bread & I said that would be fine.  Well, the bread didn't arrive until I was almost finished with my salad.  from the time that we came in it took over 45 minutes for our food to be delivered.  Do you think that they have there act together??  Probably not.  We will cross them off our list as far as a late night meal goes.  Probably go to Denny's or IHOP.\\n\\nCheck my blog, baronsrestaurants.com for reviews of other restaurants"},{"name":"Pandan Leaf","address":"569 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered food from Pandan Leaf on a very snowy day, and a very nice man delivered my food on time and even with a smile despite having to drive through the snow. \\n\\nThe food itself was still warm and quite tasty. I ordered crispy chicken Pad Thai, Tom Yum noodle soup, and mango sticky rice to split with my boyfriend. All three dishes were yummy in their own right and also not super greasy but not necessarily authentic. The Tom Yum was flavorful and came with fresh, plump shrimp but didn't have a strong herbal flavor. The crispy chicken in my pad Thai was actually delicious, but the noodles themselves could be spicier (I ordered them hot). The mango sticky rice was my favorite of all three - lots of sweet coconut cream soaking the sticky rice and fresh slices of mango that were at just the perfect ripeness. \\n\\nI'll definitely eat here again!

For starters get one, two, or all of these: meatball, lemon garlic shrimp scampi, calimari, salumi formaggi (imported and handmade) meat and cheese board it's the best I've ever had.

Our waiter recommended putting hot sauce on it, and brought some Texas Pete to put on top, and it was definitely worth it. The buckets of beer are a great deal, especially when splitting it between a couple of people.

The broth was nice and enjoyed by picky eaters who cannot eat pho with a \\"funny, off smelling\\" broth) Bun Bo Hue (didn't have the traditional piece of pork blood, but we didn't mind because we usually don't eat it. Instead of a piece of pork hock like some other restaurants, there were lots of thin pieces of pork which were tender and tasty) deep fried wings flavoured with fish sauce and black pepper(very nice when eaten right away) spring rolls(were very tasty and noticed the filling was unique with the addition of Taro) a salad roll (it had a couple of thin slices of pork along with the shrimp) and a dish in which we chose white rice, spring roll, grilled pork and pork patty (this portion was fairly generous and delicious). The restaurant and bathroom was indeed very clean as the decor is newly renovated. It is spacious and patrons do not need to worry their chairs are going to bump into others. The waitresses and staff were very gentle and polite. I really appreciated that the staff greeted us warmly and thanked us as we left.

Their handcrafted cocktails are really good, especially the Green Rock. It's one of their Spring seasonal drinks.

This dish comes with 6 shot glasses with a slice of yellowtail, cilantro, sriracha, radish, balsamic, and honey yuzu. All the ingredients are fresh and perfectly combined. This is probably my favorite item I've tried at this place. Highly recommended!\\nAnother appetizer we tried was the Pan Seared Dumplings. Done really well and had a unique presentation. The dumplings all came grouped together with garnish at the top. \\n\\nROLLS\\nTheir signature sushi rolls are good, big, and packed. Some places will give you just the minimum ingredients and add more rice to it, but not at this place. I was really satisfied with all of the rolls I tried: \\n-- The Chanel Replic which comes with scallop tempura, mango, fresh scallop, tuna, scallions, red tobiko, soy chili sauce, and creamy wasabi. Because of the mango, this roll will be more on the sweeter side. \\n\\n-- Double Decker which comes with shrimp tempura, cream cheese, sushi ebi, crab salad, tempura flakes, kabayaki, and creamy sauce. Definitely lives up to its name. \\n\\n-- Picante which comes with mild spicy yellowtail, cucumber, cilantro, fresh yellowtail, salmon, jalapeno, and yuzu sauce. This is the roll version of the yellowtail jalapeno shots. \\n\\n-- Formosa which comes with flash fried soft shell crab, crab salad, cream cheese, cucumber, avacado, bbq eel, and kabayaki. I think this roll was my favorite simply because I'm a fan of bbq eel. \\n\\n-- Yami Yami is a flash fried roll which comes with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avacado, and cream cheese. Garnished with trio creamy aioli, scallions, and masago at the top. \\n\\nDESSERT\\nFor dessert, we've had The Green Tea Creme Brulee and The Apple Bread Pudding. \\n-- The Green Tea Creme Brulee was really rich. It wasn't too sweet, which I liked, but I just didn't like flavor of this creme brulee as much.

It's a shrimp tempura roll with avocado and cucumber, topped with torched yellowtail and tobiko with spicy mayo all on top of aluminum foil sitting above a nice fire. The nigiri are pretty tiny but the rice is perfect and each nigiri is made the traditional way with a small pat of wasabi between the fish and rice.

Ramen is one of those foods that no one can seem to agree upon. Some people's favorite ramen joints are others' least favorite. I've enjoyed all of the ramen and other dishes I've tried here. I think this place is solid. I dined with friends who ate here when the business first opened and they said the food has improved. If you were turned off or unimpressed with Yebisuya months ago, you should consider revisiting.\\n\\nYebisuya is located at Peachtree Pavilion, a.k.a. the Super H Mart Doraville shopping center, not far from I-85, I-285, Peachtree Boulevard, and Buford Highway. It's next door to Shoya Izayaka, the popular Japanese restaurant that's existed in this shopping center years before the recent influx of new tenants. Yebisuya, Shoya, and Ginya Izakaya (Westside) are all connected, though I'm not sure exactly how. I don't believe all three technically have the same owner.\\n\\nYebisuya is authentic. The restaurant's storefront displays detailed food models, just like restaurants in Japan, so you can see what various dishes look like. The interior is new, clean, and spacious. In terms of the total number of seats, this is probably the biggest ramen restaurant in the Atlanta area currently. It can hold a lot of people, so group dining is not a problem, though bigger groups may have to split up. The space is a mix of modern and traditional. There are high ceilings and an open kitchen where ramen broth is made fresh each day. The dining room is partitioned. There are booths where you have to take your shoes off. There's also a private room. For music, they play current J-pop.\\n\\nThe name \\"Yebisuya Ramen\\" is misleading because this restaurant serves much more than just ramen. Like Shoya and Ginya, Yebisuya has a fairly extensive picture menu with a wide assortment of Japanese cuisine. There are over 20 different kinds of ramen to choose from, priced from $8.95 to $13.95 per bowl. Broth varieties include creamy chicken (paitan), soy, miso, salt, creamy pork (tonkotsu), and vegetarian. Apps include classics like gyoza and takoyaki ($3.95-5.95 each). They offer teishoku (meal sets, $11.95-12.95); fried noodles, rice plates, and bowls ($9.95-14.95); over 20 izakaya-style small plates (dinner only, $3.95-10.95), and desserts ($1.95-3.95) including taiyaki (fish-shaped cake) and mochi ice cream. There are seasonal specials. Currently, a couple examples include fried oysters ($11.95) and steamed bun sandwiches similar to Chinese gua bao ($2.50 each). Yebisuya also now offers poke ($7.50-14.50).\\n\\nHere's a rundown of what I've tried so far:\\n\\nApps and rice:\\n* Gyoza ($5.95) - pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings (6 pieces)\\n* Takoyaki ($5.95) - fried wheat balls with octopus, topped with BBQ sauce, mayo, fish flakes\\n* Chicken karaage ($4.95) - crispy fried chicken marinated with ginger soy sauce\\n* Edamame ($3.95) - boiled soybeans with sea salt\\n* Onigiri ($1.95) - rice ball with pork chashu, pickles\\n\\nRamen:\\n* Chicken paitan ramen ($9.95) - thick noodles, creamy chicken soup, chicken chashu, scallion, menma, spinach, boiled egg\\n* Spicy tan tan ramen ($10.95) - thick noodles, spicy sesame-tonkotsu soup, spicy minced pork, scallion, bok choy, menma, boiled egg\\n* \\"Powerful\\" tonkotsu ramen ($13.95) - thin noodles, pork soup, pork chashu, scallion, garlic chips, bean sprouts, egg, kikurage, fried onion, truffle oil\\n\\nRice add-ons to noodles:\\n* Mentaiko don ($6.95) - spicy fish roe, mayo, nori over rice\\n* Gyu don ($5.50) - beef, onion over rice\\n\\nDessert:\\n* Strawberry mochi ice cream ($3.95)\\n\\nGenerally, the dish presentation and quality of ingredients are good.\\n\\nMy favorite ramen is the \\"powerful\\" tonkotsu ramen. It's absolutely delicious and one of my favorites overall in Atlanta. Note it's an exceptionally large bowl, at least 1.5 times the typical size of ramen with extra meat, egg, and other ingredients. The broth is wonderfully flavorful thanks in part to the truffle oil. The chicken paitan ramen is one of the best chicken ramen I've tried (though I don't order chicken ramen often). Both the broth and noodles are quite good. The paitan broth is creamy, rich, and robust. The thick noodles used in the chicken paitan and spicy tan tan ramen are egg noodles while the thinner noodles used in the tonkotsu ramen are wheat noodles. I prefer the thicker egg noodles. They have outstanding texture with an ideal bite.\\n\\nOrder the add-on rice bowls. They're great. I think the mentaiko don is terrific. Fantastic flavor, temperature, and consistency. Be sure to mix it well. The gyu don is yummy too.\\n\\nAll of the apps are tasty. The gyoza are surprisingly good. I'm a fan of the chicken karaage (boneless) which is a Japanese comfort food to me. It's hard to go wrong with savory pieces of fried chicken.\\n\\nThe mochi ice cream is equivalent to what you can buy at H Mart and Costco. Not bad, but likely not homemade either.\\n\\nService is excellent."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I went to this place because my mom loves Mexican food, and we got the surprise that the food was awesome.

This was the first time in my life that I have not left a tip.\\n\\nMy friend was running late, so I was seated by myself on the patio.  No less than 20 minutes passed before anyone so much as acknowledged me, and I finally had a glass of water on my table at 30+ minutes.  This was not before the server saw me, then said \\"I'll be with you in a sec\\", and tended to the table of 8 that had literally JUST been seated next to me. Despite me sitting there alone for 30 minutes.  Pretty insulting.\\n\\nThings literally went downhill from there, if that's possible.  We didn't get the food that we ordered, and the food that we finally got (when we'd already finished everything else) that our server had forgotten to ring in was a limp, soggy mess.  Our server never bothered coming back to our table for us to be able to tell her, and when she finally came to clear our plates and we told her, she totally brushed us off.  Then we had to wait 30 minutes to even so much as FIND (yes, find, not see, because we had to search her out) our server to get our bill.\\n\\nOh, and I had to get up a total of five times throughout the 3 hours we were there (no, we weren't having a leisurely afternoon - that's literally how long it took) to ask for someone to come to our table, because our server was nowhere to be seen.  \\n\\nLike I said, I put up with a lot and let a lot of things slide, given my history in the restaurant industry, but this girl could not have cared less about doing her job, and not once apologized or even made an excuse for her complete lack of giving a shit, or pretending to.  I didn't go in having high expectations, honestly, but the treatment we received was actually insulting and put a huge damper on an afternoon that I was very much looking forward to with a friend who I rarely get to spend time with.\\n\\nI will most absolutely, 100% NOT be returning.  My expectations in general are really not particularly high, and this was beyond disappointing.  I don't know if the restaurant needs to add some staff, or get rid of the girl who \\"served\\" us (I use that word loosely), but I don't care to come around again to find out."},{"name":"Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant","address":"120-8100 Ackroyd Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"We've been here twice. The first time was great, we ordered shanghai fried noodles, all the varieties of xiao long Bao (shrimp, crab and the pork). The noodles we thought, were the best we've had so far in Vancouver. The xiao long bao's, I wouldn't recommend the shrimp OR crab version. Way too sweet, and not much layers in terms of taste. It's just sweet. The pork is legit though. \\n\\nHowever, my one star review is in regards to the SECOND time we came here. The negative reviews are true, especially towards people that don't look like they're locals OR that the owners/servers know. We're also Asian, but we generally don't speak the language as well with the same accent nor do we dress like we're locally from Richmond-Vancouver. First, it took them forever to seat us and take our order, while I noticed everyone around us who sat after us were greeted with a smile and their orders were quickly taken. That, I can ignore - i figured it's a common thing to happen in Richmond where locals are just treated better because they frequent more often than tourists. When the server finally came to take our order, everything was pretty much rushed and punched in and they didn't acknowledge or even look at us as they took our order.\\n\\n\\nThe food, we ordered the chilled chicken with the mala sauce, that's fine - tasted great. Xiao long Bao, we got the pork and that tasted fine. The shanghai noodles took 20 minutes to come AFTER we finished all of our other dishes, but the main issue were the pea vines/dou mai that we ordered. When I took a bite into it, I realized it tasted earthy. However my partner just continued eating(because we were starving), so I assumed nothing was wrong. Halfway through I really couldn't shake the thought that it was beginning to feel gritty and really earthy so I dug around and realized, THEY DID NOT WASH THE VEGETABLES. There was still grit and sand coating some of the stalks and leaves.    Naturally, I called the servers over (and they were smiling and taking orders from another table nearby), when they turned around they answered with a frown. I specifically tried to speak in their language to tell them it wasn't washed nor was it clean. The first server rudely asked if I wanted to cancel or get a new one, I said to cancel - he huffed, slammed down the menu and walked away. As he did, another server came by with the shanghai noodles (after 20 minutes since we started eating), and I told her the issue again. She looked at the noodles and grumpily said in Cantonese \\"you already ate most of it\\". And walked away.\\n\\n\\nWe did get the vegetable dish refunded, but there was no apology on their part, nor did they provide anything close to customer service on their end. We were treated like we were a burden to their establishment the whole time and this is honestly the first time we've been treated that badly and felt unwelcome at a restaurant (and we've eaten at a lot of asian, hole in the wall places places). If you're asian, but don't speak the language well or don't look the part of a HK- person living in Vancouver - don't expect good service from this place. This could be an assumption on my part, but I can't find another explanation on why we only got frowns and scowls from the moment we sat down, while other tables received smiles and courteous treatment.\\n\\nALSO, WASH YOUR VEGETABLES. Goodness knows how much pesticide or sand we ate last night, but I'm 100% sure the veggies were barely washed before they were cooked."},{"name":"City Barbeque","address":"2511 Blackmon Dr","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Slacking on taste.

The service was very friendly, if a bit slow, but the restaurant was pretty busy. We had salsa and guacamole that were pretty good, no complaints there. My reason for the three stars is the lack of awareness and training on food sensitivities, specifically gluten, and the menu felt misleading. Our waiter was kind enough to check on the tortillas and chips for me, which are NOT gluten free and they don't have anything they can sub - ok, no problem I just won't eat them. I ordered a dish that said it was served in masa cups and I double checked with our waiter that they were corn only, and he said yes. When the dish came and I tried it, the cups were just tortillas disguised so I got a bite of gluten before I realized what was up. As a result I spent the next day sick and didn't get to enjoy my vacation day as much as I could have. I consider it my responsibility to advocate for myself at a restaurant, but I did my due diligence asking about this menu and still got served gluten. For how health conscious Austin is, I just expect restaurants to at least have a clear menu. After all that, our bill was also pretty high for what we got, although the chicken was tasty.

Buffalo!! Buffalo!!! entree which was honestly just okay.  i was intrigued to try the buffalo, but it was a bit dry and i didn't enjoy it.  the sides were just okay too - i would try their salmon next time instead since they seem to be known for their seafood.  \\n\\nwe got lucky and got an amazing server!  she lived in utah in the past so we had plenty to talk about, and she made our dining experience so pleasant.  she checked in on us at the right moments, not too often, but often enough.  she noticed how fast we finished our soup and came back to see if we wanted another one.  our water was constantly replenished and she was just exceptional.  overall a fantastic dinner and this will definitely be on my list of restaurants to go to while at disney."},{"name":"Hyatt Regency Orlando","address":"9801 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Beautiful hotel - gigantic!

My friend and I were visiting and this place was next door to our AirBnB. We came here Saturday, October 20th and had brunch. I had the burger which was alright and my friend had the Harvest Brunch Bowl. Unfortunately, there was a hair in her Harvest Brunch Bowl which we knew wasn't hers as it was maybe 10 inches longer. We decided to brush it off- whatever.\\n\\nThat same day, we last minute decided to go out to eat. We returned for dinner around 8 pm. The whole restaurant seemed in chaos. We should have left. I ordered a white wine, Caesar salad, and their gluten free Alfredo. My wine came out warm and another table behind us experienced the same and complained. I also made a comment to our server who told the manager. He tried to fix it by sticking my glass of wine in a bucket of ice ... didn't think he was serious. He then tried to chill it in their refrigerators .. also didn't work. My pasta came out way after my salad was finished. That also was horrible as majority of the noodles were hard. Still didn't have a cold glass of wine by the end of the meal. \\n\\nNeither experience is on the servers. They tried their best. This is all on management. During the dinner the manager never apologized for the inconvenience, didn't even acknowledge how dissatisfied we were. Everything from the overwhelmed hostess (at 8 pm), to the multiple servers running around receiving complaints, a chaotic looking kitchen, unprepared food and drinks ... it is all on the fault of management. They need to figure it out. I will never encourage someone to waste their time or money at any of their locations.

My friend's fried rice came with a very generous amount of chicken. The serving sizes were quite large and we could have easily split one dish between the two of us.

Maybe wrap in paper skin or serve enclosed basket. Jason manager stopped over and inquired how all was going and discussed the restaurant chain and this new location in St. Cloud.

Then they bring me a baby bowl of linguine. He never even asked us if we wanted coffee, tea, more wine, he did initially before our food was served, but nothing after,  and brought us the check. \\nWe actually told the busboy that we wanted to ORDER DESSERT and see a menu and Marco brought the check instead,  VERY insulting.......\\nLike saying we are done with you.\\nI wanted to leave after I got my meal served, they were like oh well, here is your ziti attitude, deal with it, enjoy.

The chairs with the tables are brightly painted and match the bright walls.\\n\\nI'd rate the food as four stars and the service averages at a three.  Unfortunately, the service is not always consistent, though the servers are always friendly but can sometimes have too many tables at one time.  However, it clearly has not deterred me from dining at the establishment, I'd just suggest coming when you are not in a huge rush.  \\n\\nOn the drinks front, the house margarita works just fine for me.  Generous in size, they are the appropriate mix of tequila and tart lime.  For me it is the drink of choice.  \\n\\nFood wise, I have definitely sampled different entrees and have been pleased with each.  Some highlights for me include the chipotle tacos (made with chicken) and the enchiladas suizas (with your choice of chicken or beef).  As a starter, I tend to order to guacamole which is a great accompaniment to the complimentary chips.  The chips are nice and salty (not overly salty) and also come with a tomato based chunky salsa.  \\n\\nIf you have a hankering for Mexican food, this is a solid choice.

She kept forgetting to bring things and we constantly had to ask more than once. We had long waits for simple things like a water refill and lettuce wraps, we waited about 10 mins just to get a box and even longer for the bill. Our dessert was served cold although we saw the server carrying it around as other tables were being serviced.

Second, the two slices had very little in the way of toppings. The pepperoni had about 5-10 grams of the meat cut up into little pieces. The ham on the Hawaiian was almost conspicuous by its absence.

There was SO much pulled pork, that I ate half of it, and was able to make a full pulled pork sandwich out of it for lunch the next day, so you get your money's worth!  The meat itself is VERY tender, but the flavor on this meat was almost non-existent.  It pretty much demanded some form of bbq sauce, so I did add a bit of it, and it worked for the pulled pork!\\n\\nSides I ordered were their baked beans with brisket chunks.  These were good!  A little on the sweet side, but definitely nice flavor to them.  I also ordered potato salad, and these were devoured.  Nice, tasty potato salad!\\n\\nCustomer service here at City Barbeque is great, and they have no problems giving you a sample of their meats.  I actually made the comment \\"oh this is a REAL sample!\\" because the beef brisket I tried was a very nice slice of it where you get a real sampling.  Nice on that guys!\\n\\nI like City Barbeque.  It's quick, flavorful and the benefit is downloading the app gets you $5 knocked off of your meal.  Hard to beat that!  This is also a chain so if not this location, there are other locations you can hit and enjoy the food, though this new location has a very nice interior for you to dine and enjoy.\\n\\nHope you get to check them out!"},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"12400 State Hwy 71 W, Ste 710","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Tasteless vanilla skinny what is wrong with Starbucks this used to be a favorite coffee  drink  of nine  it tastes terrible dont know of I am brave enough to complain  people here are very nice but cookies is average and taste like it's been refrigerated too long  kinda of stale.

We wanted to try out this new addition to the beltline that we had heard about. \\n\\nLet me preface this review by saying this is only a review of the drinks and the overall experience. We did not have any food this evening because we were just coming for some drinks. Again, this is not a review of the food. Will have another review when that occurs. \\n\\nCold Beer has an elaborate cocktail menu of creative drinks  that changes seasonally. There are two to three drinks on the menu that are fan favorites and stay on the menu always, but a majority of the cocktails change with the season. \\n\\nCold Beer has also put a creative twist on their menu by adding a \\"beer why you wait\\" drink. For a very small fee, you can enjoy a beer in between cocktails. Because their cocktails contain intricate ingredients and take some time to make , the founders saw the patrons were waiting some time in between each cocktail to be made. Thus the \\"drink while you wait\\" beer was made and is a great little customer service idea. \\n\\nI got the winter Pimm's seasonal drink. I love a good Pimm's cup and this was their winter take on this classic. It was a beautifully crafted drink and tasted great. It was filled with cranberries oranges and extra mint. There was a tart taste to this classic rather than the light summer taste but it worked with the Christmas theme. I love the choice and I thought they did a great job. \\n\\nMy friend got a whiskey sour, which tasted great but ended up being very boozy forward. We both got a couple of round before heading out. \\n\\nThis is definitely a must stop on the beltline for a nice cocktail. I'm excited to see how the menu evolves and to try out the food. Another huge draw for Cold Beer is the aesthetics of the restaurant. It is beautiful inside and has a very modern look. It has an upscale feel and looks very clean.

Did not post because I needed to get my photo from phone and then forgot.  Sorry to someone who just went there....I see he has a complaint about the burnt/half stuck dish, too.  \\n--Have wanted to go here for happy hour for years.  Happy hour is a great way to try a restaurant before going for a full dinner.  A friend was to meet me, but did not so I sat at the bar, which I found out that eve is the only area for happy hour.  The bartender, was wonderful, and she made the whole experience great.  I enjoyed the house red wine also.  Ordered the lamb empanadas which were small and tasty.  I preferred it without the dipping sauce so I could taste the lamb.  With my second glass of wine I ordered the paella of the day, which was a pasta based one.  It had some seafood and some tasty noodles, but it was so skimpy.  It came in a small skillet, but so much of it was burned and stuck on the bottom unable to be removed.  Therefore, I got maybe five to six bites of pasta plus some pieces of fish and mussels.  I did not see squid and something else that was to be in the dish.  That is way to ridiculous for the price of $8 and really the lamb dish was overpriced as well.  Nothing wrong with small (tapas, of course) if the price is appropriate and you can eat all the food and not lose a bunch of it.  I may return to try something else, but doubt it.  There are so many places to go to as well as tried and true favorites.  I just read a bunch of reviews from this year that are not too favorable.

Usually I'm alone when this sort of thing happens but one of these groups numbered 7, and we took up the whole weird couch area for close to 15 minutes before deciding to bail. The server walked by a half dozen times and studiously avoided eye contact, so eventually we got the hint.\\n  I don't really care if it was a busy Friday night, around 10pm, you know, their prime operating hours. /s Honestly folks, read the other reviews and tell me this is some strange occurance. The management needs to recognize that something is amiss when large groups, and small groups, and single and doubles simply walk out because of non-existent service. Nobody stopped us, and there were people waiting in the little lobby. \\n  And umm...if you still think it's worth a visit...well:\\nThe neighborhood immediately surrounding this location is an absolute JOY to navigate if you don't mind crawling over tents, broken bottles, piles of stolen bike parts, and the riff-raff. I lived a fews block away for several years, that stretch of12th ave just north of Belmont and Morrison, and the little streets nearby, are teeming with homeless folks and the associated problems they generate. The Plaid Pantry next door attracts all sorts of folks from the nearby industrial warehouse areas, so be alert, especially later at night. Take an uber - if you park your car nearby and leave virtually anything in it there's a good chance you'll need to replace some glass when you get back.\\n  If that wasn't enough, the house itself is just run down looking. It's a mishmash of all sorts of pieces of furniture inside, with the large couch area I've sat at twice presenting some serious questions; what, you wonder, lurks between these cushions? With gum under the table and chairs (seriously) and everyone sitting in a different type of chari around the low coffee table, with people seated at actual tables around the edge of the room, it was just plain weird. Even if we had gotten service I don't know how long we'd have stayed. \\n   The door to the kitchen offered some insight, and the conversation overheard wasn't encouraging. Suffice it to say, there are much better options if you're looking for late-night dessert coffee house style action (Pix or Potted Cow, for instance). They've got this place covered in spades (spades covered in chocolate and infused with a rum liquor, probably).

This new concept was underwhelming.\\n\\nThere's a 4 step process to order: choose your (1) style, (2) base, (3) veggies and (4) meat. Easy enough. I went Japanese style with ramen and added roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts plus tofu for protein. The Japanese sauce was made up of a teriyaki glaze, sesame miso sauce, Japanese pickles, and furikake. Furikake is a Japanese condiment that is generally sprinkled over white rice or Japanese rice balls. I think of it as Japan's salt and pepper, consisting of ingredients such as nori (seaweed), sesame seeds, dried tuna flakes, ground shiso leaf, salmon flakes, powdered soy sauce or miso, and dried egg.\\n\\nI really dig certain cold noodle dishes because the temperature of the noodles actually enhances the taste! In this case, the sauce was overly sweet and the flavors weren't integrated. The roasted veggies shared a plate with the noodles but didn't work together. The room temp ramen paired with room temp everything else --veggies and tofu -- made me long for a saut√© pan and tongs to quickly add heat to the dish and to incorporate all of the ingredients together. My friend's dish was also doused in sriracha which overpowered her dish.

They liked their Khachapuri okay, they said, but were really happy with what they described as the finest collection of Georgian wines in Portland. \\n\\nIlya and Janila asked about our appetizer plate. \\"What these?\\" Ilya enquired about a salty, pickled green vegetable thing. \\"I have no idea.

For anyone who has had the opportunity to travel to and eat in China, this place brings back memories of delicious cooking smells wafting in side alleys in Hong Kong, Beijing or Shanghai.\\n\\nYou can see by the clientele that the cooking must be pretty close to the original version: most patrons speak Mandarin from what I can tell, and if you are the type who will pass on a restaurant because it looks too \\"ethnic\\", you are making a serious mistake.\\n\\nThe hot and sour soup here makes other versions served in Americanized Chinese restaurants taste like the Las Vegas version of The Eiffel Tower: fake and short on flavor.\\n\\nThe mapo tofu is as good as anywhere I have had it. Grandma's pork belly is divine. Hunan beef is a dream of flavor and softness. The home tofu is a delight. The jasmine tea marries with the spicy flavors perfectly.\\n\\nNow for the warning: some of the menu descriptions correspond to unexpected offerings, and yes, you might be taken aback for example by a dish of tender meat slices swimming in a broth that is not really consumable, the whole thing covered by a mountain of sliced red peppers. The flavor feels very authentic and clearly remind many customers of their hometown cooking, so you know you are getting the real deal, but it may come as a bit of a surprise compared to fare that has been dumbed down to appeal to non-Chinese expectations. \\n\\nThe best thing to do is: load the adventuring program, orders several dishes that sound good and go exploring for a change.\\n\\nExcellent place (that has never made me sick btw,) and that has the power make you forget that you are in a little strip mall in central Texas."},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Stumbled across this gem while visiting Portland.

The menu is rather large with both classic pizzas and build your own. With plenty of proteins*cheeses* and toppings to choose from. For those wanting to stay gluten free they offer a GF pizza dough.

So please take this review with the grain of salt that there is a high statistical probability that what I ate as a child was probably not very similar to what you ate.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to Chinese food, that makes me a tough customer, indeed.  I want food that is not only delicious, but that invokes the feelings of family and community that surrounded my consumption of Chinese food as a little girl.\\n\\nSo while I recognize that the fare at Get Sum Dim Sum is objectively pretty decent - i.e., fresh and well-made - it misses the mark for me.  So much of what I find so delightful about the dim sum experience is missing, here - the ability to ogle the food before I decide I must have it in my mouth; the din and bustle of the harried waitpeople pushing the steaming metal carts around the tables; the split-second negotiations that go into deciding as a group which morsels to grab from each cart before the exasperated server moves on; and the - dare I say it? - not too sterile surroundings.  For better or for worse, none of these things exist at GSDS, and for me, it's for worse.\\n\\nAs if that weren't enough, the selection here is limited to items that won't risk offending the average American - no chicken feet, no curried squid, no tripe.  And the dim sum here averages around a dollar a piece, which offends my dim sum pricing sensiibilities.  \\n\\nAll this said, I would be sorry if GSDS were to close.  We DO need more Asian food in Central Austin, and there is surely something to be said for a business model that involves offering fresh dim sum any day of the week, any time of day.  Perhaps it's not what I grew up with, but if the presence of GSDS means that more people are exposed to the delights of dim sum, then so be it.  There's room enough in this city for both the new and the old, and while you may find me lurking in spots that offer more traditional dim sum, I won't begrudge you your newfangled dim sum, either."},{"name":"JP Licks","address":"611 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"What a nice surprise to discover JP Licks!

I recommend it.\\n\\nThe main difference here between Tatsu-ya, in my opinion, is that there isn't a large add-on menu. The only add-on item listed on the menu is a soft boiled egg. I'm sure you can ask for other ingredients to add, considering how friendly the staff is. \\n\\nOverall, I'd come here more often if I lived closer in the area.

This is one of the best desert and coffee places anywhere in the city.\\n\\nMenu has a delectable mix of fresh in-house made pie and cake desert combos, and some good ice cream concoctions as well.  It's a great date spot, and a fun place to take kids and expose them to a little something fun, and a little classical music education as well.  The beautiful grand piano that's a permanent fixture in the main room is a gathering place for kids piano recitals, on-looking parents filled with smiles of love.\\n\\nThere's some serious creative goodness here.  Be prepared for some quirky fun.  At least two of the tables are extra special.  One slowly turns you around, and one goes up and down.  See if you can spot 'em!  Then there's the stairs leading up to the most creatively designed bathroom in Portland.  This you must see for yourself!  It's just special.\\n\\nNegatives?  It can get busy, and a tad loud, so be ready or go early.  Nothing they can do, there's a lot of tables, and when it gets packed it's hard to get around.  Main trouble is that they have their own style of running the place and you might say employees march to the beat of their own drum!  Not that service is bad, but they don't do \\"management\\" here, so it can seem a little off at times if that makes sense.\\n\\nOverall, just a fantastic place and I'm so happy we have it here.

The sauce that comes with this dish is great - it has a tangy vinegar bite and a little bit of heat. Since we sat at the bar, we chatted a bit with the bartender and he told us that this sauce is ONLY paired with the burnt ends, which is kind of a bummer because it was fantastic. We also had the roasted sweet potatoes, and the combo of goat cheese and spicy maple syrup was perfect. The syrup was only slightly spicy, so nothing too overwhelming. Our cocktails were refreshing and not too sweet, and the draft list was solid while not being insanely long.\\n\\nThe bartender did a great job of staying on top of our orders as well as some other patrons seated at the bar. It was pre-dinner, so not too busy yet. I think it's great when an old building can be used for something new, and this old theater provides a great fit for a bar/restaurant. I do think it would be cool if there was more decor or flare inside the dining area of the restaurant, as it looks a little understated.

They made fun of my weight when they saw me finish all my soup! (After an arduous fight getting my soup-base switched out I was gonna finish it to the last drop!). All soup refills were ignored, no extra peanuts came after mutiple requests, ice water had no ice and they remove plates in front of you while you're clearly still working on it! And worse of all, we felt unsatiated even after finishing everything on the table. When the bill came to $80, between me and my friend, we felt scammed...  (All we had was x2 HK spicy soup base, premium beef and lamb, enoki mushrooms, lotus root, and pumpkin.... literally double the price for less than half the amount of food from where I'm from!

She is the proprietor of Finnhenry's in downtown Orlando, which is up the road from Vanbarry's on North Orange Avenue, and also Ollie's Public House in College Park.\\n\\nAll three locations have a public house vibe but Vanbarry's really tries to step away and just be a real down home neighborhood bar. Ollies is great also, but that location is more sports oriented, and Finnhenry's is in the heart of downtown that is known to get a little wild on the weekends, So Vanbarry's is the just right bar in the just right location.\\n\\nThe food served here really covers a multitude of items from classic bar and pub food to a boneless braised short rib bowl. They have peel and eat shrimp, a mac & cheese skillet, nachos, burgers, sandwiches and flatbreads. Most things are pretty traditional, but a few items on the menu are very unique and delicious.\\n\\nThey also have an extensive craft beer selection on tap or out of the bottle, but cocktails and mixed drinks are a specialty here. There is a pretty extensive drink menu placed by the bar and it shouldn't be too hard to find something to fix what ales you. Wine is also available.\\n\\nWhat really makes Vanbarry's such a cool spot is the atmosphere and set up of the restaurant. The have a pretty expansive outside seating area that is mostly covered. The uncovered part has a sandpit with a firepit in the middle and plenty of lounge chairs to sit back and unwind in. \\n\\nInside is surprisingly spacious with table tops, high tops and seating at the bar. Most nights there is live music and the vibe here is as casual and laid back as it gets.\\n\\nThe Spring Fizz cocktail is made with Drumshanbo dry gin, rosemary simple syrup, lemon and prosecco. This is a great sipping drink.\\n\\nOf course, if you just want some Knob Creek with a splash of Ginger Ale, Vanbarry's can make that for you as well.\\n\\nWhen I first heard about Bacon Caramel Fries, I wasn't very sure about this concept. After my first bite, I can say... this changes everything! These are WOW amazingly good.. Salty, Sweet, Savory...what's not to like about French fries topped with caramel sauce & crispy bacon crumbles?\\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese Skillet is simple but delicious and is filled with rich ooey gooey cheese.\\n\\nOur group also really enjoyed the Happy Hippie Flatbread with Sun dried tomatoes, garlic, cucumber, tomato, red onion and mozzarella topped with arugula.\\n\\nThe Thai Chicken Salad was also surprisingly good. It's certainly different from traditional pub fare but, the flavors and textures worked really well. This is made with mixed greens, grilled chicken, noodles, shredded carrots, red peppers, tomatoes and crushed peanuts tossed in a Thai peanut dressing.\\n\\nVanbarry's really has done a great job of becoming a local public house and bar where everyone can relax and unwind. The prices are very affordable here, even for the more high end cocktails. I looked all over the menu, and I did not see one item over $10.00, aside of the fajitas, and those can serve two. \\n\\nCome over to the southside of Orlando sometimes, and you might be surprised at what you find"},{"name":"BD's Mongolian Grill","address":"3977 Worth Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Went to the one in Columbus for my daughters Volleyball team dinner.

We are all college students, so we were excited to find a place that was up late and was fairly cheap. \\n\\nHowever, the place only takes cash so you have to either go to the ATM next door at Plaid Pantry, or scrounge around for the few dollars you have in your purse (we did the latter). The food was delicious, but when it came time to pay, one of my friends found that she forgot her wallet. It was all good, we had enough to cover her, and we were able to find enough money to pay for the whole bill. Although, we did not have enough money left over to provide a tip. We felt bad not tipping, but we literally had NO more cash left so there was nothing we could do. We assumed they would understand since the waitress had been so nice to us before. \\n\\nAs we left, however, we found the waitress waiting for us outside on the porch. She proceeded to ask us if there was something wrong with the service and asked why we didn't tip. We explained to her that we were sorry, we didn't have enough money to do so. She then threatened us, saying that if we don't tip we could never come back to the restaurant. She said \\"Your bill was $37, you can go inside and figure it out\\" and then walked away.\\n\\nI have never had such rude customer service in my life. We were obviously young individuals so she decided to take that for granted and threaten us instead of just biting her lip and being disappointed that we didn't leave a tip. I have worked in customer service before so I know how bad it feels to not be tipped, but it is not acceptable to corner your customers outside of the building and tell them to go back in and tip. \\n\\nI will not be going back here."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"12400 State Hwy 71 W, Ste 710","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Well, this is totally first world problems, but when I order on the app, I have to do it like 15-20 minutes ahead of time, or it will NEVER be ready.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the app is the bomb and the reason I have probably quadrupled my stops at starbys.

I am not bitter or angry. Just want to share my experience. I was pregnant and did not know what I was looking for. I thought that Mini Miracles was suitable. I signed my baby up for infant 1 room and observed for 4 hours during a trial day. I pulled her out of the daycare immediately!\\n\\n\\nHere are the reasons:\\n\\n-Staff kissing babies on face, one had a dried scabbed cold sore on her upper lip. I have a problem with my baby getting herpes. Not ok. \\n\\n-Staff do not always adhere to no shoe policy in infant room. This is a violation. I saw a staff member with shoes on in the infant room! They were covering a break.\\n\\n-Room was very hot, one of the babies had a heat rash. I only know this because staff mentioned it. I was even sweating in there. The staff even said it was hot, had to open the door. \\n\\n-Breastfed bottles not labeled properly. Breastfed bottles should be labeled differently by the daycare to differentiate from formula. Refrigerator dirty.\\n\\n-Blanket in crib with infant (suffocation risk) and infant sleeping in seats on the ground, huge violation!! The infant slept in the seat on the ground and was not moved for 2 hours! Another infant was in the chair as well for an hour. Why do they have cribs? Cribs should be used. Look up policies on mass.gov for group daycares under Department of Early Education & Care (EEC).\\n\\n-Did not see staff washing hands, sink near diaper station broken.\\n\\n-Bottles propped up to feed while infant was in a chair, another EEC violation. \\n\\n\\nAlso after I pulled my baby out of the daycare, I called the director  and left 2 messages, no response. I finally sent an email and received a response from the facility but not her. This is not professional and I did not feel like my complaint was taken seriously. \\n\\n\\nI am sure being a daycare provider is very hard work and you need patience. IHowever, it's the responsibility of the facility to implement the rules and monitor the staff which I do not feel is happening at this place. When you are caring for infants and children, the standards should be higher. \\n\\n\\nWhen I looked into daycares, there were not many reviews which made it difficult. I am writing this review to be of some help to others especially first time mothers. If the issues I mentioned do not bother you, then you can enroll your child here. The cost is middle ground, but definitely not cheap for what you get. I did not feel safe leaving my infant there.\\n\\n I placed her in Bright Horizons which is more expensive but very good!! Staff are great, clean, and professional! They actually do activities with the infants and you get daily emails with pictures. If an infant was sick in the classroom, you get an email ASAP regarding the illness and that the infant was sent home, and toys and rooms extra sanitized. This is important as flu season is among us and infants can die from the flu. They take it very seriously. They take the babies outside for walks when the weather is nice. I like all the bells and whistles! The staff are held accountable and set to a higher standard. Its a great company. \\n\\n\\nI recommend any parent to stay and observe before leaving their child at any daycare. You may think a place looks ok but after spending some time, it may not be what you want. Babies cannot tell you what happened during the day. Also educate yourself on the rules and regulations set by EEC, do not just go by someone's review alone."},{"name":"Medell√≠n Burger","address":"1349 E Altamonte Dr, Ste 1011","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Tradicional Colombian burgers.

Aside from the beautiful floor to ceiling windows the restaurant is visibly worn down.  As we walked to our table at the far end of the restaurant I noticed that every banquette we walked by had terrible stains on the seatbacks. I'm talking about highly visible stains as we were walking by. I doubt they have been cleaned in years. \\n\\nWhen we arrived for brunch I was surprised to see that the restaurant is actually connected to the hotel's rum bar and you can walk through from one space to the other. The transition from 2 completely different restaurant concepts was awkward. \\n\\nOnce we were seated and looked at the menu (which I admit I hadn't checked in advance) I struggled to find any resemblance to a french bistro menu. Corned beef hash at a french restaurant? The most appetizing option looked like the avocado smash, but I couldn't bring myself to pay $23 for avocado toast with smoked salmon. If everything else about the experience felt special I may have gladly paid it. Instead I chose an omelette which was mediocre, and didn't even finish it. The home fries I got on the side were inconsistently sized and a little dried out, some of the pieces were the size of a dime.\\n\\nIn summary, MIEL will be a hard pass for me anytime in future."},{"name":"The Pizza Press","address":"6079 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Celebration","stars":"4.5","text":"So good!

The almond croissant was hard and very difficult from which to bite off pieces.  It didn't taste terrible, but it wasn't the stuff of dreams, either.  Having heard so much about how wonderful this particular pastry is at The Box, I was really surprised at how much I disliked it.  After about three difficult bites, I threw it away.\\n\\nThe toddy wasn't too good, either, but I drank it because I was thirsty and it was hotter than Satan's titty outside.  I had to assume I just ordered the wrong things, and I later discovered how right I was.\\n\\nOnce everyone else got there, we became a very sizable crowd of about twenty Yelpers.  We hoarded all the stools, and laughed and mooned over all the food.  All the other customers who came by looked painfully frightened that they wouldn't get any food because of our omnipresence.  Not an irrational fear, seeing as how The Box did actually run out of certain things because of us.\\n\\nKelly bought us a huuuuge plate of various macarons (thanks, Kelly!), and we devoured it quicker than a jack rabbit on a date.  We were like a swarm of bees attacking a guy with a lawn mower.  The macarons I tried were absolutely delicious, and I had to literally punch myself to keep from grabbing a third one.  \\n\\nAnd then Errol bought a lavender lemonade and shared it with me and others, and that drink was pure heaven.  I came incredibly-edibly close to buying one of my own, but I instead got ice water.  (P.S. You don't have to waste money on bottled water at The Box; they'll give you iced tap water for free.  Take advantage of it.)\\n\\nI really think the only thing The Box could improve upon would be to get some tables.  It was really annoying to have to use the stools as tables, and said stools didn't fit very well on the badly-sized concrete slats.  The legs of the stools kept slipping into the rocks in between the slabs, and drinks were nearly lost.\\n\\nSo I wasn't impressed at first, but then I tried other, better, items.  Next time, I'll try a pain au chocolate.  Really, though, I want some more lavender lemonade.  I also wanna try out the Fredericksburg Peach Soda.  I'll go back next week to get all that stuff, and I'll update after I've lost the 100 pounds I will undoubtedly gain as a result.  \\n\\nI had trouble with the word \\"macaron\\".  I didn't understand why it wasn't *macaroon*.  Thought I might have been calling it the wrong name for years on end, which would've been really embarrassing.  Alas, I just learned that a macaron actually IS a macaroon, just made slightly different.\\n\\nOne last piece of advice:  Don't ever go to The Box on a Friday afternoon if you live in NW Austin.  It took me over a fucking hour to fucking get home because fucking people fucking apparently leave fucking work fucking three hours early on fucking Fridays.  Sorry for all the fucking cursing in the last fucking paragraph.  I fucking felt like it, and it makes me laugh.\\n\\nOne more piece of advice:  Don't curse as much as I do; it's bad form."},{"name":"Main Event - Atlanta","address":"3101 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 104","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I went to Main Event with a bunch of Co Workers.

The tortilla soup was good, with fresh cilantro brightening it up just enough.  I could've done without the cojita cheese inside, though.

Of course!\\nTheir tacos aren't typical in that a fish taco usually has either slaw or typical taco toppings like lettuce, tomato and cheese. There's comes with rice, slaw, black bean salsa and an avacado crema on a flour tortilla, and was sooo good- and filling. I could barely finish 2.\\nWhile I only had to wait about 10 min, the server also brought me out fresh hush puppies apologizing for the wait! And they were good! Not hard ball but light and crisp on the outside like a proper hushpuppy should be!\\n All together, I had a Diet Coke, the two fresh fish  tacos, the free hushpuppies and my bill was $8.50. I don't think I could have made it myself for that cost and I certainly couldn't make it that well!\\n Super stoked I found this spot, now I just need to find more reasons to drive to Apopka!"},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"You must find street parking if you want to come here. \\n\\nThey have plenty of TVs at the bar.

Since this complex is newly built there is plenty of parking option and quiet a few food choices too. Well...coming back to the food experience..overall it wasnt the best I should say. Since I had been wanting a brisket since long, I got it. I had it on the buns and with a side of Mac and Cheese. Its a little sad that the brisket does not come with a side of anything. For me the quantity to the price ratio was not balanced. for $11.5 bucks something I got a tiny looking brisket bun and a side of MC. Glad I wasnt that hungry and I was sufficiently full with that. But if I was my normal then two of those portions would do me good. Judging by it I would say about $20-25 pp sounds about right for a meal here.

On Tuesday July 23 2019 at about 11 am me, my husband, my grandma and my mom came to eat here. We are originally from another city about 4 hours away. Anyways, As soon as we came in the lady didn't greet us so we chose a place to sit and my mom let her know we were going to sit on the booth. So she came and gave us the menus then the chips and dip. She asked us if we wanted anything to drink and we wanted coffee but she didn't have any of the drinks besides water and agua fresca (horchata and jamaica) So we got a horchata and a jamaica. Then when we ordered what we wanted about 30 seconds later my grandma had changed her mind and I went to the waitress to tell her that my grandma changed her mind from the pollo ala plancha to caldo de camarones. So then she said she can't do anything anymore. So I told her again that my grandma didn't want that. So she said she will check with the cook and see if its not too late. So then I waited and when she came back she said that the chicken is already cooking and she can't do anything. So I told her that we don't want that because she changed her mind and it hasn't even been 2 minutes. She yelled and she said she can't do anything because the food is going to go to waste. I told her so we aren't  going to pay for something that she isn't going to eat, it's going to go to waste either way. She said it wasn't her problem. So I got mad and told her that we are not going to pay for that because we are not going to waste our money on something she isn't going to eat when she can easily change it.!!!! not even a minute passed after we ordered and she said she couldn't do anything!

We ordered the queso fundido, which we expected to come with chorizo but that was an additional charge. We also ordered the steak huaracha which was a homemade corn tortilla (delicious) topped with steak (very well flavored and tender) and spinach with goat cheese. This was our favorite pick with a savory and almost sweet mix. We also got an order of guacamole, which was very fresh, however was a whopping $7!! The sopapillas we ordered were what we considered a traditional Mexican bunuelo; it was flat and crispy rather than a soft, doughnut like, pastry. The food, overall, was very good and a nice spin on authentic Mexican, however the prices were a little much. During happy hour a 16 oz house margarita was $4 and a domestic beer was $2 so, not bad. The appetizers were a little pricey, but we would definitely come back for the steak huaracha.

I originally went in for take out breakfast cup, which is grits, sausage, cheese and eggs in a cup for easy handling. It was fulled and cheap for 4.00 and tax.  Not many places can actually cook grits like my mama but they are on point.  I did not have to put any salt, pepper or butter in the food.  The food is made to order so it was hot and fresh.  \\n\\n2nd time I wanted to be sure so we went to dine in on a Saturday around 9ish and quickly realized there was no parking at all.  We had to keep circling because people had made themselves extra parking.lol So finally we get instead and the place is huge and damn near all tables were fill.  We asked that a booth be cleaned and sat down with no problem.  The server was a little young girl but she was polite and attentive but not over bearing.  This time ordered the # 3, which comes with 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, grits or gravy and coffee or tea for less than $6 as cheese is extra.  I again am impressed with the low prices and shocked to learn on Saturday's if you order that meal it comes with a few pancake, which was good. All the food yet again perfect!\\n\\n3rd time I changed up and tried lunch, they still had a decent crowd but nothing compared to Saturday.  I decided on the vegetable plate with turnip greens, squash casserole and sweet potato souffle.  Wow yet again I was shocked the potato did not have the stringy parts, which is always a turn off for me. The greens were seasoned and again I had no need to season anything.  I did sample the banana pudding but I must admit I did not like it at all, sadly I am not really able to explain the taste but not for me.  \\n \\nLast Saturday we went in for breakfast and ordered the #3 no complaints on the food or service, yum cheese in grits and eggs, server was again nice and not intrusive. \\n\\nFinal was last Sunday for pickup lunch ordered 2 meals and I can't remember all but this time they were serving mac and cheese and creamed corn, the creamed corn was actually shoepeg corn so not sure if they had a menu typo or not.  The greens were ok and rest was decent but I think I will be sticking to lunch.  Overall this place is opened for short time but seem to take much pride in their meals so I will definitely be back but it probably be breakfast.  \\n\\nThe only tips I can give is come with much patience for parking as well as food prep.  If you are impatient this is not the place for you. Also not sure what they offer children as I have never seen a kids menu."},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"Good food and service .

Gilbert's Wood Fired Steaks & Seafood Columbus","address":"1 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My first visit to J. Gilbert's was for a going away party for a good friend.  There were 6 of us and we were sat in a semi private side room.  I really liked the feel of the stone room, it was cozy and nice to feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Our server had a great smile and was not only incredibly friendly, but extremely good at being right there with what we needed at any given moment.\\n\\nOur group brought in our own bottles of red wine and choose to pay a corking fee for each.  J. Gilbert's is one of the few Columbus area restaurants that allows you to do that.  Our server took care of allowing our wines to breath prior to pouring, he served the wines, and kept our glasses filled.  It is a great way to enjoy great wines without paying the exorbitant amount that restaurants will up charge for bottles of good wine.\\n\\nEven though J. Gilbert's is known for their steak I ordered their maple plank roasted salmon.  I subbed the yukon mashed potatos for their side of heirloom carrots with honey sriracha butter & crystallized mint.  The salmon came highly recommended by our server.  So my expectations were heightened.  When it arrived at the table the presentation was perfect, it looked delicious.  I took a couple of bites and I was sadden.  The salmon was completely lacking in any real flavor.  I wanted so badly to taste the maple, or really just something.  The two of us that went with the salmon at the table ended up adding salt to our salmon to give it some kind of kick, some sort of flavor.  What I will say is the carrots were phenomenal.  There were only a couple of them, but they were the highlight of my dish.  I truly would have been happier with a full plate of the carrots.  So if you go, order that side.  I will also give credit to the bread that they bring to the table, it is served warm and soft in middle with a harder crust.\\n\\nUltimately, as I said this was my first visit and what is telling is that I don't feel the need go back.  I did not leave craving to have that particular dish of salmon again.  That is why I gave J. Gilbert's 3 stars.  Everything is definitely edible, but for the price you pay, you would expect more, like wanting to return."},{"name":"Suki Hanna","address":"4060 Town Center Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Os assentos da lateral do restaurante(os bancos) sao p√©ssimos, totalmente desconfort√°veis.\\nSou cliente fixa de voc√™s a anos e nao estou feliz que voces retiraram a sobremesa de banana do card√°pio com toda certeza os clientes Brasileiros v√£o sentir falta, inclusive hoje me deparei com a novidade que o casal\\nPrecisa fazer a mesma escolha, o menu ou rod√≠zio, isso nao e certo, eu nao estava afim de comer rod√≠zio e me senti pressionada, estava com meu marido e ele sempre come o rod√≠zio mas eu nao, nao como suficiente para participar de um."},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"i came here close to midnight and i was so thankful it was open!! wasn't too hungry just wanted a snack and one taco really does fill you up. the bacon was caramelized and had a sweet maple flavor to it and the tortilla was interesting but i wasn't a huge fan. it got super soggy really quickly. the chicken and sauce that it was covered with was absolutely delicious though! hope to be back to try a few other things"},{"name":"La Hacienda","address":"900 Monroe Dr NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"On site parking, a gorgeous interior and the friendliest manager make this place a four star experience; regrettably the only weak spot is the food!

My hubby ordered the chicken crawfish gumbo to start the blackened chicken cheddar cheese grit cake and fresh veggies and for dessert the pineapple upside down cake. I ordered the 55 salad filet mignon with baked potato and fresh veggies and cheesecake for dessert. Word from the other half is the gumbo was well seasoned and had nice chunks of chicken and crawfish. My 55 salad was pretty tasty as I enjoyed the dressing immensely that also had baby lettuces tomato red onion bacon bits and blue cheese crumbles. My filet was cooked perfectly and was very good with the sauce that was on it, however my veggies were bland and contained broccoli carrots cauliflower and zucchini. My baked potato was perfectly baked also. My partner said his dish wasn't blackened just seasoned but he enjoyed it along with his cheddar grit cake but he had the same boring veggies that I had.

Hey - you're the rude one for assuming that you could do this! The only acceptable place to bring in outside food is a movie theater and only if it is in a non-crinkly wrapper and stuffed discretely in a pocket and all evidence removed with you. Lastly, another reviewer complained that the wifi was only available for three hours and only for one device. Hmmm. I think you might be better off somewhere else if that is what you want. Maybe your own apartment? \\n\\nSeriously, I've been going here for years and have seen students camp out with their laptops, sipping at one cup of coffee. This is a business and while it might look a little like it, it is not an extension of your living room. Palio is a great place to have a coffee or dessert and have a conversation with friends or read a book. Beautiful setting. All the desserts that I have had here were great. Occasionally, I will bring my laptop but I am always conscious of the time and consider it a favor that they are allowing me to use their electricity and wifi and limit my usage to about an hour.

They offer valet parking for a $5 fee. What if one doesn't have cash? Total inconvenience. I mean you can choose to park at the mall and walk to the restaurant (abt 5-7 minutes) but who wants to do that in 40 degree weather. Exactly. \\n\\nI like the diversity of the servers. But what I didn't like was the service. My friend and I decided to come for brunch since several of my food friends rave about it. We honestly came for the bottomless mimosas which were okay. Flavorless juice and cheap alcohol. My friend told me they were $12 when she went. During our visit, they were $14 so they must've recently raised the price. Our server messed up entirely on my friend's food. There wasn't a regular omelette on the menu so she ordered an egg white omelet and told him to have the chef to prepare the eggs as usual, yolk included. Ya know. Regular. Our server said not a problem. The server brought an egg white omelette. She told him that's not what she ordered and he said there's no substitution and that all ingredients are reserved for each dish. If there weren't any subs, he should've mentioned that. Honestly, he appeared to be kinda out of it. Like he  partied too hard the previous night or was high. So he called a manager over at our request who was so unwelcoming. She mentioned the \\"no substitution policy\\" which by the way isn't notated on the menu and nothing our server said to us but then said she'll see what she could do. They finally brought out the dish she requested but at that point, our dining experience was negatively altered. \\n\\nI'm on a plant based diet so I asked the server if I could order the omelette with no eggs since it already had the veggies I wanted (spinach, avocado, peppers) and he said great. I swear it was the little side of veggies I've seen for $11 and they almost forgot the avocado had not my friend remembered. If it was an issue of them \\"reserving all the ingredients for each meal\\", they could've used my eggs for her omelette. It was a load of bull.  So if I ever come back, it would be for the food.

Not that the invite said there would be, but it's a given and even my friends who throw Oscar parties in their homes rent them. \\nTwo, the \\"photo booth\\" mentioned in the invite was nothing more than the built-in one that only captures your heads, and that you have to pay for. No back drop to pose in front of, which clubs use for promotions. \\nThree, the bar hosted the Blazer game prior, so none of us who came dressed up for the event got to sit in the main area, because the Blazer fans stuck around. That meant that those of us in evening attire had to sit in the over flow area near the bar, and watch on a small screen. Needless to say, we didn't bother to watch the awards show because we couldn't hear it. \\nFour, We ordered drinks and a bottle of champagne and never got the free popcorn or free photos in the photo booth. We also never did see a champagne bar. \\nThat all said, I can see the allure of the stadium seating and rooftop bar.

However, the Shanghai style food is excellent.\\n\\nVisiting Richmond and went there for dinner with local family members. Fortunately, we called ahead made reservation. Otherwise we had to wait for hours before getting a table. There was a huge line   inside the restaurant waiting for table. Obviously it made the space even more crowded than it already was.\\n\\nThe food was extraordinary, which explains why people are willing to spend hours waiting for a seat. The Shanghai style steamed bun is made from fresh meat, nicely flavored and filled with lots of delicious juice. The pan fried bun is another favorite authentic Shanghainese bun. Pan fried and steamed, the bun has a crispy crunchy bottom but soft tender upper skin. It's bigger than the steamed bun, with more fillings, less juice but equally delicious. Personally, I like pan fried bun better because its texture is more subtle and more satisfying.\\n\\nThe braise pork belly is another Shanghainese signature dish, really tender and juicy, with a balanced flavor, a perfect combination of the sweetness from sugar and saltiness from soy sauce. Though there is lots of fat in the pork belly, the taste is not too greasy at all. The dish goes great with rice.\\n\\nThe saut√©ed sliced fish with rice wine sauce got lots of distinctive flavor from the wine, maybe too strong for some people but I found it quite pleasant. The fish is fresh and very tender. Perhaps too tender that it's easily broken under the chopstick if you're not careful. Overall, it's a unique dish.\\n\\nThe red bean paste pancake is another unique but yummy dish. The texture is very delicate with crunchy crispy outer skin and soft moisten inside. The red bean paste's sweetness is a good balance, mild and not overwhelming. It's a good ending for a nice meal. \\n\\nIn summary, it's a nice Shanghai style restaurant providing solid authentic dishes. If you can neglect the waiting line, loud noise and tight space, you will sure enjoy the delicious food."},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Been here hella times and idk WHY i haven't left a review already.

Keep walking, find yourself seat. They have tables, booths, spots at the bar, an outdoor patio and even a worn down couch in the back. Eventually, someone will be over to help you. \\n\\nThis place gets hella busy, especially if you go during the evening on the weekends- which I don't advise unless you just really want THE Jack's experience, complete with long ass wait times and wondering if you will ever actually eat.

They tell you not to leave shit in your car (duh), not to write obscene shit, to tell on your waiter if they're bitchy, to be patient with your food cuz apparently there is only ONE oven! \\n\\nJacks is known around town for their unconventional pizza concoctions. They have slices that include some pretty random shit like mashed potatoes, macaroni, collard greens, and artichokes to name a few. They also have awesome wings. (baked, FYI) i've tried a lot of wings in atlanta and theirs are definitely towards the top of my list. My I've tried almost all the wing flavors, but my favorites are the chipotle and honey bourbon.

First, his food came out and then mine about 4 minutes later (same thing happened when I met my gf for lunch) which I think is awful. Being from a food and beverage background, I understand that maybe you didn't want the food to get cold, but it will stay hotter under the heat lamps than sitting out at the table while waiting on the second entree. Then the egg Benedict came(which was a HUGE treat for me) and the eggs were super overcooked- no runny yellow, more like hard boiled. The Hollandaise sauce had great flavor and it would have been an A+ if the eggs weren't over cooked and the homefries weren't cold (however, they were still yummy cold!) our server was very attentive until we got our food, then she never once came back and asked how it was.

A delicious combo of sprouts, veggies, meat (I chose beef) and of course, a delicious sunny side egg on top. I am a sucker for anything with a cracked egg on top. I'd eat my own boot if there was a cracked egg on top.

Anticipating our needs for more bread and fresh drinks before we ever had to speak. So lively, kind, and really honest about... well, just about anything that you can imagine. But we liked it. \\n\\nSecond stars for the beer bread. The beer bread was so delicious, soft and moist. The butter was just the right amount of sweetness to complement. \\n\\nThird star for the ribs. The ribs alone could get all the stars in my book. Sweet bbq sauce, but not too sweet. Meat so tender it falls off the bone. I rarely have ribs that are cooked that perfectly. Well done, Saltgrass. \\n\\nFourth star for my friend's dish - the New York strip. Again, cooked to perfection. So juicy and seasoned in its own juices. If you're a steak lover, which I'm admittedly not, I recommend that you test this out and make your own evaluation. \\n\\nFifth star for literally everything else.

It only could survive because it had no employees (being a workers' collective, legally they were all owners).

Instead of being genuinely compassionate, the owners of Red and Black Cafe enabled them and ruin the business. The quality of food declined rapidly over the past 2 years, while homeless with mental illness and poor hygiene loitered both inside and outside this business 24/7, stinking up the whole place and shooting up in the restroom (and the owners asked the 911 dispatchers to not send cops when a homeless OD'ed in the restroom one day).

When our starters arrived  we divided up among us and were not impressed. Sadly, the brocolli rabe with a warm custard bechamel sauce was slopped on our plate and looked less than appealing to eat. The brocolli itself was good but the sauce lacked flavor. The ham croquettes tasted like they had been sitting a while and unfortunately soaked up the oil they were in causing them to be chewy.

We made a reservation in December (5 months ago) for a friend's bachelorette party, and our group of about 15 people (most married and in their 30s) arrived for our 8:30 pm dinner reservation. The restaurant was not full, but it took about 40 minutes for our drinks to arrive. About an hour and a half after we'd ordered food, the waitress (who was great) let us know that no food alterations were allowed that night. Only a few people had made alterations because of allergies (e.g. one person asked for corn tortillas instead of flour after the waitress confirmed they had corn tortillas and another asked for a shellfish garnish to simply be left off). Another guest with type 1 diabetes asked the male manager (pictured) what liquors were in their house margarita. He could not have been more rude, condescending, or unhelpful, and mocked the question by saying, \\"it's a margarita, so stuff in a margarita.\\" When she asked what specifically that stuff was, he begrudgingly told her a list that included orange liquor - she told him she couldn't drink that and asked if they could make one without it. He rudely responded by laughing and saying, \\"No. I'll just make you a regular one and you'll enjoy it.\\" She reiterated that she literally could not drink it. He just kept laughing at our group and walking away whenever someone asked questions, and could be spotted throughout the night texting in the kitchen. The food finally came out close to 10:30 pm - TWO HOURS after we'd arrived. Five of our guests ordered shrimp tacos and they were nearly inedible as they were coated in a thick fried crust despite that not being disclosed on the menu online or in the restaurant. At the end of the meal, the manager let us know that part of the issue that night was that the CHEF WAS DRUNK from celebrating Memorial Day, which is the reason for the problem. After the bachelorette spoke with him, he was ultimately apologetic and our meal was discounted, but not without him offering the caveat that he hates apologizing. I can't stress enough how horrifically rude the manager was all night. I know all jobs can be stressful and I used to work in a restaurant, but no one deserves to be mocked, laughed at, and spoken to so rudely or have to publicly qualify a simple question due to a private medical condition.

Price is reasonable, the waiter was kind. Want give a second try!"},{"name":"Noor Mediterranean Grill","address":"136 College Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food. The meat is marinated, tender and super flavorful. I'd recommend the beef. We usually order a beef kebab plate with extra meat and a plate is usually plenty for both my husband and I."},{"name":"Doc Chey's Dragon Bowl","address":"1556 N Decatur Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I have gone to this location twice, and both time gotten extremely sick within minutes of eating.  The first time I thought it was just my weak stomach, but when it happened a second time (with a different meal) I knew it was because of their food.\\nI immediately returned my to-go order and let them know what happened.  There was no option of refund and the simply said 'weird!' and acted as if I was making it up.\\nTheir food is nothing to rave about, regardless of the getting sick part.  I do not recommend this chain at all."},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The employees here are inattentive at the kbbq and most times i have to set up my own grill.

Along with the bananas, they have positive attitudes and smiling faces. Service is always fast and my order comes out right. Will be returning a few more times while in Florida on vacation."},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We absolutely love this place. The service is outstanding, as is the food. You absolutely cannot miss the biscuits. We also love the fried chicken,  and the tamarind cauliflower is spectacular. For brunch, we love the fried chicken eggs benedict and the donuts are also wonderful. All of the cocktails are exceptional, too! I would not consider myself a gin drinker but the Market Punch is excellent! Very well balanced. As an added bonus... the place is absolutely gorgeous!"},{"name":"Casey's Diner","address":"36 South Ave","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"Food is very consistent and clean.

We were lucky enough to also snag a spot on the street right outside and got in line for a table quickly. \\n\\nTheir menu is pretty extensive and slightly overwhelming, but I am at a dumpling house. Gotta order me some XLB. My boyfriend and I shared the XLB, a fried rice, and the fried bean curd. The XLB was very underwhelming as there was minimal soup and the filling was minimal and very rough. The fried rice was a basic Chinese fried rice, not much to rave about. The fried bean curd was probably our winner of the night. It was served piping hot and the fried bean curd was covered in enoki mushrooms and sauce. Yummm, probably could've just had that and a bowl of white rice. \\n\\nDinesty hit the spot with their other dishes, but I wish I loved their dumplings a little more."},{"name":"TSUJIRI Richmond","address":"1535 - 4777 Mcclelland Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"As someone who loves matcha, TSUJIRI serves a delicious and tasty matcha float. Right amount of soft serve and just perfect. I came to tsujiri shortly after having the matcha float from Matcha Maiko (5 mins away). It was so disappointing that I was not satisfied and came to Tsujiri instead. We also tried the green tea opera cake but was not a fan of the Yuzu citrus taste. \\n\\nWill definitely be back here as the matcha float is unparalleled to other matcha\\n\\nAdditional comments: \\n- washrooms were kind of dirty and not maintained as well as it should've been. It was 8:30pm and quite late but I think that would be one area of improvement."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),o(m,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const G=u(R,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-773041c7"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/56.md","filePath":"quotesmag/56.md"}'),L={name:"quotesmag/56.md"},J=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(G)]))}});export{V as __pageData,J as default};
