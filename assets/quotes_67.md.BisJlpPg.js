With that said, my favorite place thus far is Ponko Chicken. \\n\\nPonko Chicken is a Japanese-style chicken restaurant.  You can really feel the Japanese influence by tasting the light breading of the fried chicken tenders.  Some of the sides have a Japanese influence, but they also have the classics like sweet potato fries.  In a way, the fusion reminds me of Heirloom BBQ.  \\n\\nYou can enjoy chicken tenders alone or a part of a rice bowl or salad bowl.  Each chicken tender is legit in size, taste, and crunch; fortunately, they don't skimp out on the quantity either.  If you're trying to eat a little cleaner, you can't go wrong with the grilled chicken because it's really moist with some burnt edges (if you're into that) and it's marinated in a teriyaki-like sauce.  That marinade has flavor for daysss.\\n\\nOverall, 4.5 stars!"},{"name":"Suri's Flavors","address":"732 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Fantastic little gem on Davie with one of the best values for takeaway food in the downtown core.

The last couple of times that I've been to Mikado I've been unhappy with the service. I either have to wait too long for the waitress when I need something or I have to ask multiple times for the same thing. Today there were only 2 tables busy counting mine, I ordered sushi rolls, and I could tell they were ready when I saw them on top of the sushi bar.

It's a neighborhood taquieria that when the sun is up offers a family friendly place to have a cheap Mexican dinner if you are willing to order your food cafeteria style and bus your own space, or a fabulous place to have a pre Blazer game cocktail or 2 before walking down to the Max.  By night, it's a salsa dancing club/above average bar to have a margarita or 3 before walking home.  If you are expecting it to be a waitered, service oriented restaurant it's not.  \\n\\nThe food is good.  It's really hard to screw up Mexican, and it shouldn't be expensive.  Some people complain about the portion size, all I can say is that I'm more about quality than quantity.  If you want a mondo super giant burrito, I know a place in Seattle called Gorditos that will make your pants stretch.  I prefer to not leave a restaurant bloated and wishing I had worn my Rheinlander Pants, nor with a desire to experiment with bulimia.  Maybe I'm weird, but I really doubt it.\\n\\nThe drinks are strong, and have been consistently strong for the past 9 months.  They have a happy hour menu that lasts until 6:30, and then another one for late night folks.  It's all good, no bad as far as I'm concerned at Aztec Willies.  \\n\\nTo sum up,  Aztec Willie's is a tasty, affordable Mexican restaurant in a neighborhood environment not owned by a multinational corporation, but rather by locals.

When he came back I tried to order the chicken quesadillas, which he tells me they don't serve anymore.  So I asked about the tuna (I'm very picky with mayo-y tuna), and the waiter was extremely unhelpful.  So I opted for choice #3, the smoked trout salad, NO onions.\\n\\nAfter I ordered I noticed that there were ants crawling all over the counter!  Since the place was empty, I just sat at another table.  Some other guy (looked like the manager, owner, or host) dropped off my salad.  WITH onions, ugh.  When the waiter saw me piling raw onions on a napkin, he came by and said sorry, that he had forgotten to tell them no onions. \\n\\nThe salad was really good though (despite the fact that I had to pick out 1000 onions), but the lackluster waiter, ants, and having to opt for my 2nd and 3rd choices in drink and food...

What a disappointment.\\n\\n1)  They brought their typical little basket of muffins and biscuit.  The biscuit was way undercooked.\\n\\n2)  They no longer serve the roasted potatoes, they have cold hash-browns instead.  They add some cold chopped tomatoes, green peppers and onions on top, which adds no flavor and makes it even colder.  The roasted potatoes were a much better option.  The hash-browns almost made me return my meal.\\n\\n3) My dish was the Eggs San Francisco.  Again, everything was undercooked, the poached eggs were slimy, the english muffing was not even toasted, and it felt like it had been defrosted.  The spinach, seriously?  Can you at least add some salt?  It was cold, watery, no taste.  The tomato, well, I will not even mention that... I don't know what made my english muffin watery, either the spinach or the whatever tomato.\\n\\nAs far as my friend's, he had the same opinion about the hashbrowns, and his omelette was just blah, accordingly to his description.\\n\\nWe both wondered what happened for the food to come so ordinarily prepared, and tasteless for a place such as Murphy's.  At least, the server was very nice and offered to replace the meal, but I ate it anyways because I was hungry and hate to waste food.

The restaurant itself is beautiful, outdoor seating area looks super fun. Originally seated by the window but had to switch because the AC was just blowing straight on me. Still, decently big tables, comfy seats, all good so far.\\n\\nWe were hungry and got 3 appetizers to start:\\n- Chu-toro crudo: 4 small pieces, pretty expensive. And it just wasn't as fatty or buttery as I was hoping for in a chu-toro, tasted more like reguarl tuna. The big dollop of sauce on top was also disappointingly overpowering, can't taste much of the fish at all.\\n- Grilled octopus: Another measly couple pieces. The veggies were actually quite good but light on flavor. The octopus itself was way too soft and mealy. Part of the reason I love squid and octopus when they're made well is the slightly firm and crunchy texture. If \\"over-tenderized\\" is a thing, this is it\\n- Prosciutto with mozzarella: Best app of the meal. It's hard to go wrong with a plate of thinly sliced prosciutto di parma. The mozzarella tasted closer to burrata and was quite good.\\n\\nPasta entrees:\\n- Spaghetti with crab and uni: Ugh had such high hopes seeing everyone raving about this. Don't get me wrong, the pasta itself is cooked perfectly, no complaints there. But I honestly do not taste the uni at all, and the crab bits were so tiny. The spice was a little too much IMO as well. Not a fan.\\n- Paccheri with lobster: This one was much better, a nice sauce with sun dried tomatoes. Can always use more quantity of lobster, but at least you can see them in here.\\n\\nLast negative thing about our experience here was that the service was incredibly slow. It was not a super busy night, and our meal took close to 3 hrs. We literally waited more than 30min for the crudo (our first appetizer) to show up, and come on, how long does it take to slice some fish? We were so sick of sitting there that we went home and got ice cream from Whole Foods for dessert instead.\\n\\nSo overall, some good dishes but also a lot of misses for me.

The restaurant decor is adorable and cute with the turquoise/teal(?) (who knows, love the blue/green color) walls and various bird adornments everywhere.  We were tempted to try the bone marrow but decided to be less adventurous this night.  I had the cassoulet of duck leg, pork belly, and sausage over white beans.  The sauce was flavorful and light and the juicy meat on the duck leg fell off the bone.  My favorite was the pork belly which practically melted in my mouth.  My hubster enjoyed the poissin au vin, fried leg, and bacon & mushroom pot pie.  The way he was smacking his lips across the table, I would say he enjoyed his fried leg thoroughly.  \\n\\nFor sides, we ordered the goat cheese creamed kale and the macaroni gratin.  The goat cheese creamed kale was amazing!  Creamed kale is one thing, but the goat cheese brought it UP to another level.  It added a delectable tangy tastiness to the greens.  Macaroni gratin was pretty good, but nothing too spectacular.  I love food but we're not highly literate in the gastronomy vocabulary so we asked our server what the macaroni gratin was.  I really appreciated that the server was not pretentious whatsoever and quite frankly answered \\"It's a fancy mac n cheese, to break it down.\\"  Speaking of our server, he was exceptional!  He was highly attentive, re-filled our waters and bread, was knowledgeable about the menu, and gave me a great recommendation on wine choice to pair with my meal.  \\n\\nAt the end of the meal, we shared a coconut cake with passionfruit sorbet.  The passionfruit sorbet was delicious and quite creamy for a sorbet.  We wished we could have eaten it by the bowlfuls.  The coconut cake...meh.

Fun Fact, many celebrities like Mark Walhberg and Justin Timberlake have eaten here! \\n\\nThe Food: Their oysters are a MUST! We ordered the Island Creek, Katama Bay, Mookie Blue, and Kumamoto Oysters. My favorite was the Island Creek ones, but the others were also really good. Who knew that eating oysters could be so fancy? The menu listed salinity, size, and even a special remark about each oyster!  Also, who knew oysters could taste like fruits? The Kumamoto had an interesting Honeydew aftertaste to it. \\n\\nFor Appetizers, we ordered the Well Fleet Clam Chowder and Yellowfin Coyne Crostini (Tuna Tartare). The clam chowder is made fresh to order and is very generous with portions of clam. It was definitely one of the best clam chowders I've ever had! Most restaurants made the mistake of adding to much salt, but the one here is perfect. The Tuna Tartare was also very fresh and came with a piece of bruschetta bread.\\n\\nThe Service: Despite being busy the whole time, I liked that our server stopped by frequently to check on us and answer any questions that we had.

The space is still great: upscale and clean. \\n\\nUpon arriving we were greeted at the front, just past the entrance bar. The hosts/mgmt were very friendly and very informative regarding the menu (don't worry sir, I eat much spicier food than this daily, although I guess I understand the judgement based off my skin complexion and the amount of returned food you must have had due to the spiciness.) Extremely friendly and professional. \\n\\nOur server was very pleasant, although it took a bit longer than desired for some things (drinks, extra utensils.) Restaurant was pretty slow, about 4 or 5 tables at that point. Great server otherwise. \\n\\nFor food we had the Shao Long Bao, Duck Heads, Dan Dan Mein, Mapo Dofu, and the Hong Shao Ro. \\n\\nSoup dumplings were amazing. No need for the soy sauce vinegar they give with it, but it does add another level of flavor if you try it. The broth inside was wonderful and there was plenty of fresh tasting meat as well. Dough was slightly thick but these were pretty much perfect. Absolutely will order again. 5.\\n\\nI'd seen the duck heads on Yelp! and really wanted to try them since...I don't know of anywhere else that had this dish. Flavor wise everything was decent. The brains were clean and creamy and the chili on top added a nice compliment to the marinated duck flavor. Overall, too many bones and difficulty ducking around to get any meat. 3.5. Average for me. I'd  try the crispy duck next time instead.\\n\\nThe Dan Dan Mein was...interesting. as others have noted, this isn't the typical Dan Dan noodles I've had and love so very much. The noodles are soft, ours felt kind of overcooked like typical pad Thai noodles...There was no heat, I'd asked for peppercorn powder if available and some chili oil, but they only had chili oil. (The La Jiao they have is nice and smoky, though not very spicy. Pour it on everything. I'd drink this stuff if it wasn't, well, oil. ) Lots of bell peppers and a good amount of meat, but it didn't save the blandness and consistency of the noodles. 3 for these unfortunately. (Extra unfortunate since these are the main reason I'd come here.)\\n\\nThe Mapo Dofu was a bunch of silken pudding cubes of tofu in this wonderfully aromatic sauce. You could dump this onto anything and you'd finish eating it. I don't often order this dish as I'm super picky with it, but this one was totally worth it. 4.5. \\n\\nBest for last right? Inch thick slabs of meltingly soft pig fat attached to slightly smaller chunks of incredibly tender meat. Braised in some wonderful sauce and light spiced, with fat leeks and bok choy. Holy crap. My lips were so sticky in the most satisfying way that only collagen from perfectly cooked meat can produce. The flavor, texture, and surprisingly large portion made this dish a breakout star. Some people don't like eating fat. I don't understand those people. It's good for you. Come here for this dish. 5.\\n\\nOverall, I'd give this new spot 4.25 stars. It's not worth a trip around the world for, but it's totally worth a trip to another neighborhood. Service is great and food was above good. For the price, you get much more than you pay for."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Arguably, in many people's opinions, Portland's Le Pigeon is one of the finest restaurants around.

The foie gras that they did have was not really foie gras and I was disappointed that they did not have just simple and extremely delicious foie gras.  Why dress up something with sugar and extras when the original is so fantastic.  I liked the charcuterie platter, but it wasn't anything special to me.  I ordered the special for the night with the seared tuna as well as the duck confit.  The aioli sauce was not that great and the manner it was just plopped onto the tuna took away from the presentation.  The duck confit was on a bed of lentils and although it tasted fine I ended the meal wanting more.  Duck confit can me made in so many creative ways and it takes flavor so easily that it left me questioning why everyone thinks so highly of this place.  \\n\\nOverall not a bad spot, but I wouldn't rave about it nor would I go out of my way to eat here.

The interior dining room and bar are much larger than you would expect from the strip mall exterior.  This being our first time here, went with the full rodizio experience (for a bargain $24.99), complete with passadors (and cute ones, too).  The salad/sides bar had a fairly wide variety of things, leafy greens, salad fixings, beans of various types, grilled eggplant and sauteed zucchini, bacon and potato salad, tabbouleh, broccoli drowned in cheese (which was delicious), maduros.  On the whole, sufficient, but not wow.  If you do just the buffet for $16.99, it comes with 4 AUCE meats:  roasted chicken drumstick, pork ribs, sausage, sirloin.  There are 11 table service meats, if you go full on.  The first 4 they bring you, however, are the 4 already available on buffet.  We were asked our preference for meat temperatures and stated medium-rare, but at lunch on a weekday, we did not really expect that anything would be cooked to order for us, that would just not be economical for the restaurant.  Pretty much everything was well-done, except for the top sirloin, which was also one of the best cuts they put forth.  Others on top:  chicken breast wrapped in bacon (surprisingly moist), garlic marinated beef, top sirloin.  If you can save room for it, def go for a slice of grilled pineapple dusted in cinnamon.  You could get plenty full on the cheaper buffet, not sure the upgrade is worth it unless you plan on eating at least a couple pounds of meat."},{"name":"The Ginger Man","address":"148 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great selection of beer - they have tons to offer.

Something happened to this place in just a short month.  Returned with some friends for happy hour and dinner and food was a disaster!

The Ceviche' was bland and had brown avacado.  The soup, cold and blah.  So, another friend ordered a meal and said it was good to very good.  And with that, another friend & I ordered a burger to share, thinking it would be better than happy hour food, WRONG!!!  The burger was ordered medium and it was jet-black on one side, and brown on the other.  Had a taste of charcol, and not pleasant.  And it was also COLD, along with the fries.  \\nFortunately, service was friendly.  With one exception, we did mention the burger was well overcooked and tasted of char and the server said, oh really and walked away.  He was very nice about it, but  there was no offer to re-make the food.  If I had eaten lunch that day, I would have insisted on sending back, but I just wanted to get out of there.

For dinner we tried the hot lobster roll and the bowl of littlenecks in a garlic, white wine sauce.  The lobster roll was as good as everyone said...buttery, warm, melt in your mouth, large pieces of lobster, good fries.  It was gone very fast.  The littlenecks were large and tasty.  Lots of garlic which is always good.  \\n\\nAs others mentioned, service was a bit slow and it was packed...but we weren't in any rush and in fact appreciated taking our time and not feeling like they wanted us out the door for the next couple.

They have a wooden bar, behind which there is a little sandwich assembly line. I saw them bring the warm pita and meat from the back kitchen and then top our pitas right in front of me. The prices were also pretty good. Two gyros and a hummus app came to $22 altogether, a bargain for dinner for two. \\n\\nEverything was still piping hot when we got back to the house, which was a plus. The hummus was okay, although I thought they went a little heavy on the tahini, leaving behind a slight peanut buttery flavor. It came with a generous pile of warm pita for dipping, which was really tasty. \\n\\nThe gyros themselves were not the best I've ever had. That's an understatement.  I'm kind of surprised about the positive reviews, actually. They used an extremely heavy hand on the tzatziki sauce (which is saying something because normally I'd be happy to flat out dip my gyro in the stuff) that kind of overwhelmed everything else, including the bread. I also thought the sauce itself was waaaaayyyy too close to straight mayo to call itself tzatziki with a straight face. Mayo-covered veggies were literally plopping from the sandwich as I ate it.

Rosa had a prefixed menu for NYE and we picked few items from the menu.  I chose three enchiladas and requested veggies instead of chicken, I asked for all the vegetables they had in the kitchen.  The sauces (tomatillo, roasted tomato and another red sauce) for enchiladas were fantastic but the vegetable fillings were a miss.  \\n\\nThe house gaucamole is creative, a server mixes the toppings with the mashed avocado tableside for the presentation.

Basically little Turkish pizzas!  My client makes these with tortillas so it's lighter on the stomach. She serves this with lemon and fresh made yogurt/ tzakziki. I'm lucky if I get to eat these once every 3 months as she usually alternates the food every meeting.\\n\\nWith that said, I was so adamant on finding a place that serves these. I was only able to find 3 places, 2 in burnaby and 1 in Richmond.  Since I work in Richmond,I decided to give Lahmajoun a try, I mean the place is named after my favorite Turkish dish!\\n\\nUpon arrival, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. This place was on river road, located where other local business in an industrial place is. It is a very small place. There is only 3 tables as this is mainly a place to order food for parties. When we entered, a lovely lady came and greeted us and let us know she's there to help. I already knew what I was going to order, beef lahmajoun and pide. My friend originally wanted to order their pork ribs, but that was sold out, so she suggested the pork chops. He didn't end up getting the pork chops as she stated it'll take about 25 minutes. He ended up ordering the jumbo kebab wrap, boy it was jumbo!\\n\\nUnfortunately I didn't end up ordering my beef pide, the lady said it would take 30 minutes. So I just ended up ordering a couple of beef lahmajoun. \\n\\nWhen the food came, I was sooo excited! Everything looked delicious. I wish my lahmajoun was served with yogurt or lemon like my clients, but my friend said this place probably makes authentic food, while my client makes it her way. He was right though, the food is very authentic and delicious! \\n\\nAt the end, the lady asked how our food was and how it was compared to my clients. I said the food was great, but different. The lady told us that their food is Armenian, not Turkish, but have similar foods.\\n\\nOverall this was a pleasant experience. I'm happy that they make their food fresh.

This one fits the bill. It's authentic down to the environment and service style. Cash only, no alcohol (based on my last visit), and mainland style service. The name is deceiving, it's not a noodle house at all; noodles & buns are more of a Northern specialty, so I will only order foods based on the restaurants regional expertise. I believe the story is that they just kept the name of the previous restaurant? Quirky and misleading, yes.\\n\\nFolks who don't know what Hunanese food represents, spicy, numbing, oily, and flavourful. Do some research to understand the cuisine. 'Chinese' food is equivalent to stating 'Canadian' food, you need to look deeper. Hunanese food is the most flavour and spiced packed combo of taste in my opinion. Sichuan is spicy and numb, the numb from the prickly ash berries helps with not feeling the pain of the spice in your mouth, and Hunan is a variation of this, finessed with sour and savoury. Mainland style service is simple, abrupt (some take it personally and call it rude), and I find it quirky and charming in it's own way. If you don't like these two factors, then this might not be your kind of restaurant, so don't diss it if you don't understand it. \\n\\nGreat classic dishes to try here are: Cumin lamb, Chili Chicken (it'll look like it's mostly chilli, and yes, that's how it supposed to be, the # of chillies fried with the chicken is to give flavour to the chicken), Saut√©ed Green Chili Peppers (tiger skin chilli), Sour and Spicy Fish in soup, Country-Style Pork Stirfry and Pan Fried cabbage."},{"name":"Islington Pizza and Sub Shop","address":"315 Washington St","city":"Westwood","stars":"3.5","text":"I had small issue while visiting islington for the first time but was very impressed by the immediate response I received from the owner, Maria.

I can't remember what type of muffins, but I do remember eating two of them quite quickly. The biscuits were flaky and buttery and my mom raved about them ... but I was quite content with my muffins.\\n\\nFor our food, I ordered the Southwest Frittata and my mom had the Eggs T. Murhpy. The frittata was amazing - the eggs were light and fluffy, and it had everything in it that I could have hoped for. I didn't know when I ordered that it came with Chorizo, which was a great surprise! Oddly, my favorite part was the sour cream, it really just brought everything together for me.\\n\\nThe Eggs T. Murphy were also quite good, but not as good as I've had elsewhere. I'll start by saying that the eggs were poached perfectly. However, I didn't think the hollandaise was as flavorful as I've had elsewhere. It was rather thick and seemed to be missing something - my guess is lemon. It came with homemade English muffins, but they were disproportionately large for the dish. Still quite good, but not something I'd order on a return visit.\\n\\nOverall, Murphy's delivers a top-notch brunch experience. Their menu is extensive and we've barely even scratched the surface.

The beer list was nothing to look down at, including some of my favorites from all over Germany.\\n\\nAmbiance at cheese bar is clean, yet warm, and suits a cheese bar concept well.  Not necessarily cheap, but it isn't overpriced for what they serve at all, in fact, really for the quality of the food, I guess you could argue it is cheap...\\n\\nOur only point of disappointment, and I have to be honest, it was pretty disappointing, is that you don't get to choose the cheeses on your cheese tray.  This baffled me.  Even at fine restaurants, there is a cheese cart where you may choose from a group of selections, no such thing here.  You are stuck with their choices, and there is only one choice, not even, say, tray 1 is these cheeses, tray 2 is these other cheese, just 1 option for a cheese tray at a place called cheese bar..... puzzling honestly.  I would return, but I don't see a long term dining favorite here until they open up to the idea of offering some more selections to the customer on the cheese trays, after all, isn't that the best way to have people same your wares and later buy them from your cooler?\\n\\nLong story short, great place, worth a trip back, but please cheese bar, consider granting my wish of broadening the cheese tray selections, it could be so lovely!!!"},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Went there for the first time (and first time in Portland) last weekend. \\n\\nHoly crap that pizza is good.

The broth is clean, but like all other ramen places in this city, it's lacking flavor. Perhaps I should just sprinkle msg on it, and see if that helps. My other issue with the broth is that the napa cabbage they put in just waters it down further. The pork, I'm guessing either shoulder or butt, was actually flavored well superficially, but so so dry, and not in the its absorbed a bunch of flavor into the meat, but in the \\"we didnt cook it slowly\\" way. Service here was good and prompt, but I was also the only person at 12:15PM. I've pretty much given up on ramen in Atlanta.

One would be a large portrait made by Kehinde Wiley, one of my favorite living artists. Another highlight is a Chihuly sculpture in the courtyard.  Art history is not a focus of the CMA, so most of the art is not older than 200 years. This is not a place to see Egyptian or Asian art, which is what most people are used to seeing when they go to art museums. Most of the traveling galleries are less than exciting, and honestly you can walk this whole museum in 30 minutes easily. \\n\\nI highly recommend the museums in Cinci and Detroit. The CMA has been a mess for over 10 years. I really really really hope the expansion helps. \\n\\nGo to this museum on a sunday (it's free), and walk over to the Topiary Park when you are done.

This was not dried out, flavorful, and had veggies. A+, you passed the test, Fiesta Jalisco. \\n    I never got a check so I just went to the cashier stand and waited. And waited. My waiter showed up, mumbled my total and turned the computer screen so I could see it. I paid and he had the gall to wait for a tip! The meek, yellow-bellied confrontation-phobe I am, I handed him back one of my ones n for the first time, he smiled. \\n   So if you want some good Mexican food and don't think you need a server, this is the place!

Wanting to surprise my girlfriend, this was an excellent way to experience a new restaurant and provide a new experience for myself and my girlfriend.  I took all the necessary steps and made a reservation after reading some reviews.\\n\\nScampo has benefit of using technology so I was pleased to I received an online confirmation.  This was later followed up with a call confirming my reservation days before my reservation.  My anticipation was growing.\\n\\nI arrived with my boyfriend.  He is very particular about seating so promptly asked for another table after being guided toward the kitchen door.  Fortunately they were not that busy, and we were accommodated shortly after the host returned to check availability.  \\n\\nAt that point we noticed we didn't have a Restaurant Week menu and asked why after a few curious moments. A wait staff person explained extensively that there had been confusion between the lunch and dinner offering and they were only offering lunch and apologized.  When our waiter returned we explained what the other staff had said and he said he didn't know and was only aware of the lunch offering.  \\n\\nWe felt a bit confused and asked him if it had been an ongoing confusion but he seemed to think we were the confused ones.  Feeling a bit uncomfortable we decided to leave though we checked in with the hostess on the way out.  \\n\\nShe explained that it had been a confusing week because Boston Restaurant Week had put up lunch and dinner on their site and they had been trying to get it down because they were only participating in lunch segment.  \\n\\nLittle effort was made to make us feel welcome and we left feeling frustrated that no one seemed to care as we left; whatever accolades we read about were quickly dissolved.\\n\\nOne would expect a dining establishment of this caliber to make necessary accommodations to ensure excellence in service \\n\\nThere were multiple opportunities to either correct or buffer the ensuing events 1) the reservation reminder is an opportunity to engage the guest and that did not particularly occur; 2a) a correction during that call should have occurred or; 2b) Scampo should have taken responsibility to make a minor accommodation for a comprable meal since they failed to properly document the nature of our dining experience (as a former restaurant owner I am fully aware of the POS systems and their customer profiling capabilities especially at this level); 2c) at a bare minimum Scampo should have honored the intended reservation based on what was published in Restaurant Week in order to mitigate the situation.  \\n\\nBut none of this occurred-- how unfortunate.  In my experience I have seen much lesser of a restaurant send a manager over to address the scenario to ensure continuity in the service standards.  We unfortunately discovered that Scampo lacked this quality standard, and I dare say did not possess it at all.\\n\\nThe two stars reflect that you don't get to that level of the restaurant game without some merit, my experience with my girlfriend was more like a 1 star"},{"name":"Wai Wai Restaurant","address":"26 Oxford St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Sometimes you have to throw caution to the wind and eat a meal that makes you feel like you're going to have a heart attack in the very near future.

I grew up with this place and even though I don't eat there so much now (about once every couple of weeks,) there are times when I crave the chicken leg, roast pork and char siu on top of rice, smothered in ginger and scallion sauce, oozing with sweet soy sauce.

It's fairly close to where I live and offers a great lunch menu. The service is always pleasant with no complaints ever. I dine here so frequently that some of the servers remember my order...\\n\\nThe first thing I would like to point out is how well they execute the bento box. In fact, it's the best bento box I've ever tried, and I've tried places where they specialize in bento boxes! All the items that are included in the bento box are well cooked and seasoned. If you go for lunch, the bento box averages at $9. For $5 you can upgrade it to include fried rice, spring roll, gyoza, and a crunch roll, which I'd recommend. This is still cheaper than the dinner bento box that averages at around $20.  \\n\\nI usually order the sashimi lunch special with a side of sushi rice for a total of $13. The sushi is above average but certainly not the best in Orlando. It is fairly priced and I'm always satisfied with the quality of the fish and sushi rice. They also take pride in their presentation. \\n\\nAll in all this is a great Japanese restaurant in the Hunters Creek area that offers great sushi as well as kitchen items.

The menu is huge with every type of breakfast food being offered so it didn't seem like they had any sort of focus or specialties. I ended up ordering the loaded bowl with a maddie cake on the side. I really appreciate places that offer vegetarian gravy but overall it lacked flavor and the hashbrowns in the bowl were a little mushy and undercooked. It wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't outstanding. However the maddie cake was delicious. The ricotta made the pancake moist and it was delicious topped with the blueberry compote. \\n\\nOverall my friends had a similar experience; the food was okay but certainly not something that deserves a wait.

They are all for sale too. There is a stage like area that's been turned into a kids play area with lots of toys, so it is kid friendly. The menu is mostly breakfast/brunch items and dishes, and the prices are mid range. But the dishes are pretty good portions. I had a ham and cheese scramble and it came with a bunch of hash browns. Very good, in fact I should have saved some for later, but I ate it all--so full. They also have options for veggie people, plus they serve cocktails and beer too.

The gravy must be really expensive to make, 'cause they ration it out like gold...we had the Reggie Deluxe and Biscuits with spreads...$11.50 for about $6 worth of grub in most breakfast-type places in the PDX area.

Well I guess that I was wrong.\\n\\nClery's has a very unique setup, which features 3 \\"rooms\\" of sorts. The first one you'll see upon entering is the bar area. You'll also notice a dining area on the same floor, in a different room. The kicker for this place though is that there's also a basement which is a dance floor. Thing is, the place is packed and there's a line inside the place to get downstairs. We waited for nearly 30 minutes to go to the basement that day which was rather annoying and frankly not all that worth it. The music was hit or miss and the crowds at the bar were ten people deep. After I managed to get my drinks I swore to myself that no matter how thirsty I got, that I'd never wait in line for another round again. Ever. \\n\\nI'm not sure how this place is during the week but I don't know if I'd return again on a weekend and I can definitely state that it's not a place worth waiting in line for as there's many better bars in the area. \\n\\nThe one upside about the place is that if by some miracle you do manage to get a table upstairs, you will get some pretty good table service which will save you a few headaches as the place is big and you guess it... crowded.\\n\\nThe crowd there is mixed by most people seemed to up in their 20s and 30s.

Decent food!\\n\\nMy friend says this place is pretty authentic Mexican food, but in my opinion, it lies somewhere in between Tex-Mex and typical Mexican food. \\n\\nThis place is hidden away in an office park, they have a tiny waiting space as they seem constantly busy. We stopped by after work one Friday, were sat prompty and made our order. The menu is standard Mexican faire, with Chimichangas, Burritos, Tacos, Enchiladas of sorts. They have a little bar that tells you how spicy the food / dish is, which is a little weird to me, as I believe dishes should come in customizable spice like most ethnic places. But at the end of the day, I got the chicken chimichanga and asked for it extra extra spicy, but sadly, it was not really spicy at all. (Even for American-level spiciness, it was very mild.)\\n\\nAnyway, we ordered a couple of Magaritas as well. The magaritas were fantastic! Not sure if it was pre-mix based, if it was, I couldn't tell. It packs a very strong punch and I couldn't have more than one. With a very decent price, this is a great after-work drinking spot.\\n\\nThe food came quickly after the Margs arrived. This place has an interesting bit to their process where they broil the plate and the food at once, before serving, so the plate is pretty hot. The chimichanga I ordered was in a little ball, covered with what I assumed was green chile, with a side of rice and beans covered in cheese. The cheese is a little crunchy due to the broiling prior to serving.\\n\\nI thought it was... decent. The shredded chicken was moist, and the green chile is flavorful, despite it not being spicy whatsoever. The green chile itself was a mild sauce, couldn't quite detect the distinct spiciness or flavor you'd get from green chile and it melded most of the flavors on the plate together. It was a good play on texture but I found the flavor overall slightly one-note. The rice and beans were okay, nothing too special. Overall, a decent chimichanga with a twist. \\n\\nWill definitely be coming back for an after-work meetup, but I'm not sure if I would return solely for the food as I believe there are many more authentic places around. The magaritas were wonderful though!\\n\\nOne last thing that I would be remiss if I didn't add. They do have a 2 hour limit on the tables that's placed to the side of the table. Me and my friend stayed for abit and was asked to leave 2 and a half hours into our meal, which is understandable. Just a quick note for anyone visiting and planning to stay awhile."},{"name":"Chago's Caribbean Cuisine","address":"7301 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Authentic spot that is on fleek.

I ordered the Chicken-Fried Trout\\npickled carrots, dill, radishes, dijon, gribiche* It was good but a little too salty. We were offered desert menus but we were both a bit too full for desert.

Well a lot snobby. Like pretentious in that hipster i'm so much cooler than you sort of way. But some people really go for that so I mean, whatever. What really bothered me is how unaccommodating and inhospitable some of their policies are: A sign at the door read something to the extent of \\"We will not push furniture together for a large group, if you want to eat here you will be seated at seperate, smaller tables. No Exceptions.\\"  And on the menu there was a large note in capital letters that said \\"DON'T CAMP OUT AT YOUR TABLE. PLEASE PAY YOUR CHECK AND LEAVE.\\" Granted, this may seem like a courtesy to the people waiting in line for the tables, but it's just downright rude.

But the art on the walls was fantastic, and the decor and menu design was really really nice.

If you ever want to come try this place, make sure to come 2-3 hours before the actual time you'd like to eat (esp. on the weekends), because that's how long of a wait it will be. If your stomach is on flex time, come on a weekday between lunch and dinner, and the wait will be a lot more manageable - 5-15 mins wait.\\n\\nAlthough there's a long wait, this place is definitely worth it. The lobster roll is amazing - get the hot one and ditch the cold - the hot buttery lobster roll brings out the fresh lobster flavor a lot better than the cold mayo ones (and that's a general rule of thumb with LR at any given place, trust me). $25 for a sandwich might sound a bit steep, but you get a butt load of lobster meat where you don't need to get cracking 3 lobsters to get to it. \\n\\nAside from the lobster rolls, Neptune has a great variety of selection at the raw bar. It's like ordering sushi, they give you a little piece of paper with all kinds of raw goodness on it with descriptions for each of them, and you can order them by however many you want - great way to try different kinds and not have to commit to one option by the half-dozen like most other places are. (C'mon, we are all commitment phobic one way or another, it's difficult to commit to SIX of the same kind of oysters!)\\n\\nThis place is tiny - bar seating on one side, tables on the other side against the wall. But to keep it as an oyster BAR, all of their seating are raised to a counter-top level (even if you're not siting at the bar). I really appreciate when restaurants put little details like that for their identity, so this makes me like this place even more.\\n\\nTo compare with the other oyster bars in town, Union Oyster House is more touristy, for the history, and a bit more run down. Island Creek is more hip and modern, putting raw bar with a contemporary twist, where as Neptune is more of a classy, traditional and sophisticated oyster bar.

Maybe my downfall is that I didn't ask for extra gravy but towards the end, I had to stop eating because it wasn't appealing without the yummy gravy.

So the fried chicken that I've had here was really juicy. There was one visit where it was over-done. But my other visits, the dish was cooked quite well and the chicken was moist, oozing with its juices as it was engorged in the sausage gravy sauce, the melted Tillamook cheese. To top it off nothing says Portland without a piece of BACON and a fried egg! As gluttonous as this sounds, you won't be disappointed with the taste of this sandwich. \\n\\n- PINE STATE FRIED CLUB is a trio of fried grit cakes that come with pieces of fried chicken and spiced honey (hot sauce + honey). One grit has pimiento cheese, another with a fried green tomato, and the third with grilled country ham & cheese. Very southern food-esque and quite decent for a heavy breakfast fare. \\n\\n- THE MONEYBALL is your simple biscuits with gravy and one fried egg. You can make it a double down by having two eggs as well. \\n\\nFYI:\\n- Was featured on Food Network's Diner's Drive-ins and Dive's [3D's] (and probably the only restaurant that I agree with Guy)\\n- Accepts CC (Visa, MC)\\n- Parking on the street or neighborhood streets\\n- Always a line out the door for their food, come early!\\n- This location is about 2-3x bigger than the other SE Belmont location (more seating here)\\n- Bus your own tables\\n- Order food, find a seat, wait for your food to be called\\n- They have $5 HH bites\\n\\nPSB is a one of the staple restaurants in Portland.

My husband and I had our first date here over four years ago, and we went back lastnight to celebrate our two year wedding anniversary. It was one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences we have had, probably because we know how wonderful it used to be. It took our server 6 minutes to greet us and fill water. She didn't even apologize for it taking a long time. While she wasn't rude- she was just completely apathetic the entire time. The appetizer took a while and we had to ask her to bring bread which came after the app. Every other time we have been here they asked us if we wanted bread, so that seemed off. After we ordered our main course, she came back 15 minutes later to tell us they were out of the dish I ordered. She said the kitchen had just told her - which may or may not be true, but really- 15 minutes after we've ordered you find out they're out of it?! I finished my first glass of wine and it took her 5 minutes to come by and ask if I wanted another glass. When we did finally get our food- it was mediocre at best. I ended up with the hanger steak that I could have made better myself in my own kitchen. My husband got the shrimp and the rice was stickier than sushi rice. The manager (I think it was a manager anyway) walked by or table to ask if the food was okay- but she didn't even stop- she literally did a walk by! So we just nodded because we weren't going to tell her no while she was literally walking away and obviously didn't actually care. Our server asked how our dinner was and my husband told her his meal wasn't great and the rice was way too sticky, and she said \\"ya, it can be inconsistent based on who the sous chef is.\\" Really?! An appropriate response would have been: \\"I'm so sorry you didn't enjoy it\\". At this point we were just over it and wanted to get out of there, so we didn't order dessert or coffee. We didn't want to spend any more money in that place. Our bill was about $125 as it was, and it was not even remotely worth the money. We had planned and budgeted to have several drinks and desserts and have a great time out, as our first date there had been, but we were so disappointed we just paid and left. My husband had told them it was our anniversary when he made reservation, and we didn't even get a \\"hey, thanks for coming in tonight, happy anniversary\\" from our server. \\nWe ended up going to The Highlander after we left Murphy's, where we had better service! I honestly wish we had just gone there to begin with.

A little too bland for my taste. The broth was rich. The chicken was equally dry and bland. Not terribly great.\\n\\nAll in all, Chago's definitely does not offer a spectacular dining experience. Nothing that is a need-to order. Give it a shot if you are lookin out for something coastal and unique. Otherwise, no need to dine here."},{"name":"J.

You know what I mean--the memory lurks in the back of your subconcious, lying dormant, until one day it wakes up and turns into a full-on craving?  The Pork Vindalho is one of those dishes for me.  Seriously delicious and definitely crave-worthy: tender, melt-in-your-mouth pork with just enough spicy, smoky heat.  M-m-m-m! \\n\\nAdmittedly, I've only been to Vindalho a handful of times, but when I do go, I always want to order the same thing.  However, my fellow diners seemed pleased with their dishes as well.  The food seems to be more Indian-influenced, so if you are looking for something more straight up and traditional, you might head to Bombay Cricket Club, for example.  But, the food is really good nontheless--I'd say a strong 3.5+ stars for the food, and 4+ for the pork dish that I love.  The wide selection of chutneys is a fun taste adventure as well.  Also, the mulligitawny lentil soup is a wonderful starter.\\n\\nMore pluses:\\nA really nice, classy atmosphere - with high ceilings, big windows, and an artsy and modern ambiance.  It can get loud when crowded, but it's still comfortable.  Sit at the bar if you forgot reservations and the tables are full.  Nice bar menu with beer, wine, and cocktails.

This was fine with us, as we took it as a sign that nothing was sitting around in the back under a heat lamp.

The beef and scallions were also the same -- delicious and authentic. The beef was wonderfully tender, which is also great. The pork meatballs were served in a large bowl of broth.

It came in a sauce of oil, red peppers, ginger and garlic. That sauce was out of this world delicious, spicy and just a little bit sweet. The fish itself was properly cooked and easily flaked apart with our chopsticks. Only a little sadly, the eyes were already removed, so we could not eat them too. \\n\\nIt is worth noting that the atmosphere of the place is rather divey, and there is no table service.

The listener is shares the emotions of Calaf, feels his love for the princess and his hope for success in his tasks and the consummation that will come from it - even if they know nothing of the story behind the work.\\n\\nTo understand my experience of the Italian Kitchen, though, I must ask you to imagine  Turandot performed by Nickelback.

Also, don't be afraid that you'll leave hungry; there's definitely enough pasta to fill you up and sometimes even more so.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed the dish, I admit I haven't been back for another couple years.\\n\\nMy most recent visit, however, was not as positive.  This time I ordered the Patrizi's Red Sauce with their meatball.  Again, this dish was visually stunning, and the meatball was fairly large.  I can already tell I'm going to get super full that night.  However, the sauce just wasn't for me.  Specifically, it was so thick and heavy that after finishing off just half of the dish, my taste buds were done for the night.  I usually tend to avoid marinara sauce and the like due to its heaviness, but this red sauce definitely takes the cake.

Not sure how places manage to fail on fries but they did. How does a busy pub serve cold soggy fries? Yes many other diners had fries. \\nMy friend's fish and chips was not much better. Her fries were also cold and her fish tasted like it was store bought frozen fish. Mushy, grainy and bland. \\n\\nI thought this would be a go to place in the summer but now every time I walk by it'll just remind me of how my lunch date was ruined."},{"name":"Osteria Nino","address":"19 3rd Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"Went with a group of 6 of us on a Friday night.

I'm not sure if it was because it was the first dish and we were so hungry, but it was a great way to kick off the brunch.\\n\\n-Potatoes Bravas: their version of patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) was overall delicious. White creamy slightly spicy sauce on top of large potatoes, but never thought to put egg on top. That yolk drizzle...superb.\\n\\n-Korean Fried Chicken: had to try it, since it was suggested on yelp. To me, a little bit out of place, quite spicy, and was just like bi bim bap, so wasn't a highlight for me.\\n\\n-Pork Schnitzel: Tender cutlets, slightly crunchy cabbage, and distinct havarti cheese made this dish very complex to the taste. Make sure to get a little of everything in one bite\\n\\n-Duck Duck Steak: Another one of the faves, perfectly medium rare (sidenote - I've never been with another group of 4 that all likes their meat cooked the same way, so YES!), it was hard to savor the taste because you just want more.\\n\\nEverything came with an egg on or inside, and we had a great time sharing our tapas with our party of four.

I really wanted to like this place and thought it would be as amazing as everyone else had described it to be, but in the end, I can't think of a meal more anticipated that left me more disappointed.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I recently came here around 5:15 on a Thursday afternoon. Bear in mind that unless you come here between 2 and 4, or after 9, expect a wait. Just an FYI that a wait was expected and I'm not complaining about that, as it wasn't bad at all - they told us 75 minutes and called us back after an hour saying that our table was ready. Despite the place being very busy, the staff who took our name for the wait list, as well the staffer who called us back, were both very friendly.\\n\\nMoving inside, the place is packed and tiny. People also walk in with babies and young children, so it can be challenging to move around, especially when people are trying to carry collapsed stollers through to store back by the kitchen while they eat.\\n\\nOk, so to eat? I had really been anticipating their lobster roll ($27) and ordered that. As for my girlfriend, she had the Flash Seared Nantucket Yellowfin Tuna ($34). I had the lobster roll served Connecticut style, which is just warm, with butter. I looked over the raw bar menu and while it looked tempting, we just stuck with our entrees and water to drink.\\n\\nWhen our food arrived, what others have said about Neptune's Lobster Roll is very true - it is epic! It huge and filled with a lot of lobster. The brioche roll is soft as well and it a nice touch, as compared to a hot dog bun.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends. In terms of taste and flavor, the lobster roll was very disappointing. Both the roll and the lobster were saturated with butter, and I mean really, terribly oversaturated. Perhaps I made a mistake and asked for lobster with my warm butter roll? I've also tasted fresher lobster meat. Not that what they were serving had gone bad, but it really didn't have the taste of the ocean.\\n\\nI also tried some of my girlfriend's tuna and when it comes to flash searing, Neptune's definitely nailed the cooking technique. It was perfectly flash seared. However, in the end, this dish was also disappointing. It may have been perfectly flash seared, but it didn't seem to have any seasoning or flavor to it whatsoever. In the end, just the Lobster Roll and Seared Tuna, with tax and tip, came to $75.\\n\\nI'm sure the raw bar here is top notch. Definitely no complaints about the service. Perhaps that itself will warrant a second visit, or maybe the clam chowder? We shall see.

We had reservations, but they waited for everyone in our group to arrive before seating us. (I tried brunch without reservations once--note: don't do that--and they wouldn't even put us on the list until everyone was there.) The hostesses were friendly, and our waiter was very eager to please...maybe a little bit too eager...and seemed to really pride himself on his extensive knowledge of the wines and menu. (Not necessarily a bad thing, but you know what I mean. He didn't take himself too seriously to joke with us though, so he was good.)\\n\\nThey have a good size wine list, with half-glass, glass and bottle options. They have a few specialty cocktails and beers, but the wine seemed to be the focus. I had a $7 glass that was very good.\\n\\nTo start, I had the Caesar salad--not necessarily a standout, except for the spicy croutons, but still very tasty and a good-size portion. For my entree, I had the Guinness-braised brisket. I loved it! The meat was super tender, and the portion was just right...plenty with a few bites to share. It was served over horseradish mashed potatoes, which were great. (The horseradish taste was strongest in a sauce drizzled over the top, though.) There were also French green beans (nice and bright, still a little crunchy) and some roasted carrots. If anything, I thought the carrots were kind of a throw-away...seemed cooked until tender instead of really roasted.\\n\\nEveryone else enjoyed their food, too, and our waiter was very accommodating with substitutions and made sure everybody got what they wanted.

Another thing, as Errol pointed out--the scenery really picks up after the bars close. All the pretty birds seem to flock here for after-hours pancakes and revelry. Which is OK by me.

Interesting. Couldn't justify spending $12 on it though. \\n\\nOverall I like this place because of the $5 Entree night, but otherwise I probably wouldn't pay full price for anything on the menu.

I was excited after reading the reviews but my experience was no where near the 4 stars + I've seen on yelp.  The attentiveness of their staff and quality of their food left me feeling I had been ripped off.  The guy working the register was nice but kept asking me to repeat my order and at times seemed high.  The guy behind the bar was loud, obnoxious, and desperately seeking the attention of patron.  He seemed to be bragging on the chicken sauce recipe.  Anyway, I would have been fine with the unprofessional environment if the quality of my food had made up for it.  I ordered the $10 chicken tender platter with fries and coleslaw.  The tenders were a disappointment; small and drenched in a weird sauce that was too salty. And, the fries were cold!

I also read that it cost $29.  Not only could I eat the best lobster roll in Boston, but I could also tell people that I spent $29 on a lobster roll.  It's a win-win.  Needless to say, the launch sequence had been activated.\\n\\nI got to Boston with six others in my group.  I might have encouraged them all to hoof it from the harbor to the North End to try this place I had heard about.  When we arrived--surprise!--it would have been impossible to seat all seven of us in such a small place.  I didn't want to give up and leave, but group dynamic being what it is, we set out for another place to eat.  After realizing that all of these North End places are literal holes-in-walls that would not easily fit seven, I made my move.  I informed the group that we'd be best off splitting up and reconvening after we all ate.  Then I high-tailed my Uranus back to Neptune Oyster.  As a single diner I was seated immediately while groups were told that it would be a two hour wait.\\n\\nGenerally I do not care to read people's personal stories on Yelp, I want to know if the food is good or not.  I tell my story this time to impress upon you this fact: the lobster roll is as good as advertised and you should break up your group to get it.  They'll probably forgive you, but you'll definitely love your meal.\\n\\nI chose the hot buttered lobster roll, because hot butter is great and mayo is disgusting.  There was a ton of meat stuffed into the bun, so you're not solely paying for the name on the building, you are getting a substantial sandwich.  The lobster meat was tender and juicy and did I mention slathered in butter.  Butter!  The bun was soft but still held up well to the heavy load it was subjected to.  In a moment of weakness, I asked for salad on the side instead of fries.  I guess I was lobster-drunk.  It was fine, but looking at the other diners in the place I kind of wish I had their fries.  \\n\\nI am cheap.  So cheap.  But I would pay $29 for this meal every day of the week.

The cornmeal consistency cake was topped with trout, creme fraiche, and caviar.  The saltiness of the fish and the sweetness of the johnnycake made for a perfect combination.  I didn't think it could get any better, but the lobster roll was phenomenal.  I was disappointed that I was sharing all this food, because I wanted more - it was so good!

The lady servicing me was less than thrilled to be there. She was blatantly rude when I asked for simple recommendations. I felt I was asking her for her left arm when I ordered half a dozen of her doughnuts. I'm usually very capable of overlooking bad service if the food is good. In this case, it wasn't, so I can't. The doughnuts themselves were about 90% dough. It was like eating a deep fried pound cake with thick sugar on top. I didn't enjoy them at all. An unfortunate disappointment.

I waited in line for close to 15 minutes while the staff worked with zero hustle. Once I got to the front of the line I was greeted by an open mouth yawn from the crew member (without covering her mouth of course). When I ordered a chicken burrito she told me that they were out of chicken. One crewmember who seems semi-competent had the intelligence to tell me that they were not out of chicken but I would have to wait about six minutes for it. Though that is a semi reasonable amount of time to wait the line was so filthy I couldn't get myself to order anything and left.  Worst location ever.  I've had similar experiences here on many occasions.

We went at 12pm on a Sunday; they said it would be an hour and a half and they were absolutely right. But, alas, sometimes you gotta wait. I'm not tripping. Plus, they take your phone number so you can walk around and see the cute buildings. \\n\\nSo when you walk in, you notice the place is hecka small, kinda cramped (some call this cozy, I don't).  My friend and I were seated at a table for four with two people we didn't know, but it wasn't that bad at all. The servers were relatively prompt (not the most attentive, but I've had worse), and brought out the water and my friend's glass of wine pretty quickly. \\n\\nBut what about the food?  So I ordered the clam chowder and lobster roll because apparently that's what all the cool kids do (and quite the commitment at 27 bucks). I thought the clam chowder was super yummy; I'm from LA, and usually NE clam chowder is creamier around my neck of the woods. This one was a bit watery but I figured it must just be authentic, after all I AM in Boston. The flavor was spot on and yum-yum-yummy. \\n\\nNow for the lobster roll. Remember, I don't like lobster. But I ordered it. If you like lobster, you might like it. I did not. It was a bit better with the mayo we requested on the side, but my problem was that the lobster was in super big chunks and really chewy. Like I thought my jaw was gonna cramp from all the chewing. I gave up after about 3 bites, no more lobster for me.  Although, for what it's worth, my friend loves lobster and was underwhelmed. \\n\\nSo, this is a long way of saying I'm happy I went, clam chowder was good, lobster roll was definitely not for me, and if I were to go back (which I wouldn't be opposed to) I'd probably get a fish dish. Give it a try, be prepared for a wait and a pricey menu, and don't order lobster if you don't like lobster."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to Redbones for the first time on Friday evening as part of a group of seven, and had a terrific time!

I live for their pulled pork.  Plus, where else can you get collard greens and succotash (two items that, I swear, if they did not serve anymore my sister would never come to visit me)?  In off-peak hours, I most recently went late on a Sunny Saturday Afternoon, it's great.  Solid service, a great selection of reasonably priced draft beers and, like I mentioned before, the pulled pork.  They must put crack cocaine in that ish because it is deadly in the best way possible.  Additionally, I think they have a good thing going with the Mason Jars of water and non-alcoholic drinks.  It keeps you filled and refreshed for your entire meal rather than having the waiter or waitress come over time and time again to fill your glass up.  When that happens I always partly want to yell, \\"Get off my grill!  I'm trying to EAT,\\"\\n\\nMy Beefs (no pun intended): They are a little stingy on the sauce.

Seriously.  \\n\\nAfter reading several reviews about the slow service, I put off trying this place for a bit because when I am hungry, I am hungry!  But I wanted something new and unique (to me) so we gave it a shot.  Yes, it is relatively small.  Yes, the food did take a bit longer than what I would hope but I knew going into it that this would be the case.  Once I got my food I could see why.  I ordered the original pancake sampler which consisted of 4 of their original pancake dishes.  They were ridiculious.  Red Velvet, apple, Reeces, and Alaskan Banana.  Just writing that makes me feel like I should work off some calories.  A delicious splurge, each one a work of art.  Very rich and could easily be split.  My daughter had the Cinnamon Toast Crunch Waffles.  We were told they were amazing and that was not a stretch.  I would love to say that we will come back for lunch because the lunch menu though small, looked great. But in all honesty, I would not be able to look beyond the breakfast menu.

If it was based on food alone I probably would but because I am so big on service I just can't. \\n\\nLet's start with the positive....GREAT food, very small menu but I don't care because I love the vermicelli bowls so much! You can pretty much choose from a noodle bowl or a a bahn mi sandwich. And you can add summer rolls as well. They offer a lot of meat options including pork, chicken and tofu, of the lemon grass or Chinese bbq variety. I personally suggest Chinese bbq pork or lemon grass tofu! The tofu summer rolls are what keep me coming back. The peanut dipping sauce mixed with the perfect light crunch of the tofu is unbelievably yummy.\\n\\nPricing is awesome, they do accept cash only. But I think they give you a good amount of food for the cost! Hopefully plastic is in their future for convenience sake.\\n\\nOn to atmosphere, it's cute and quaint. Very eclectic array of tables and chairs, all kind of out in the open. Not very intimate by any means, but I love the Thai/Asian feel. It can be dirty and not well kept at times. I feel like there is a ton of room for improvement here. The outside patio alone could be adorable. Just need to put some money into bettering the place.\\n\\nNow on to the service....it could be SO much better. I visit here often and am not impressed by much of the wait staff. They kinda act as though they are doing you a huge favor if you ask for anything extra. Even asking for a spoon or for them to refill the water jug seems like a danting task to these service folk. A smile and a kind attitude never hurt nobody!\\n\\nOverall I really love this place! I hope as time goes on service improves a bit and the yummy food doesn't lose it's touch.

After researching tons of nice restaurants in Atlanta, we decided on Murphy's, because the menu seemed to have something for everyone.  We couldn't have picked a more perfect place!  The hostesses were polite and approachable.  Our reservation was honored with no wait, except for us waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  They were even nice enough to seat us before our entire party was there.  \\n\\nFor small plates, we ordered the cheese plate, mussels, and calamari (one of their specialties).  Everything was simply delectable!  The mussels were cooked perfectly and were juicy and succulent; the cheese was delicious and flavorful (the goat cheese is to die for); and the calamari definitely lived up to its reputation!  One of our friends had never had calamari, and she definitely became a fan of it that night!\\n\\nOur server, Jodi was very knowledgeable about the menu, and had a very energetic, lighthearted, and accommodating personality.  She was able to suggest the perfect wines, based on the taste profiles that we described to her.  I really appreciated her expertise and thorough, accurate descriptions of the menu items.  She made all of our mouths water, by the way she explained the wines and dishes.  So many things on the menu sounded good that, at times, we had a hard time deciding, but Jodi made it really easy for us to choose, with personalized suggestions, based on what we wanted.\\n\\nPer wine, we wanted something bright and flavorful (but not OVERLY sweet) to complement our small plates, and she suggested a bottle of the Kuentz Bas pinot gris.  She was spot-on to a tee!  Everyone loved it, and it went very well with what we ordered.  I would definitely recommend it.  I wanted a glass of something bold and red to go with my entree, so Jodi recommended one of the Argentinean Malbecs.  I'm almost certain that it was the Achaval Ferrer, but I can't be 100% sure.  Whatever it was, it packed just the punch that I was going for.  The South African Shiraz was also very nice.\\n\\nFor the entree, I ordered the Sausage and Spinach Meatloaf.  I know meatloaf may not sound THAT exciting, and I was semi-reluctant about getting it because it seemed kind of boring, but again, Jodi stepped in and described it in a way that made me feel like I needed it in my life!  And I did not regret my decision.  It was a very hearty, homey entree that made me feel warm and fuzzy inside (in the best way possible).  A fulfilling portion of two perfectly-cooked, moist, melt-in-your-mouth slices of meatloaf, stacked atop each other, smothered in zesty marinara sauce; smooth, creamy mashed potatoes, and crisp-but-juicy green beans.  Call me dramatic, but after almost every bite, I just closed my eyes and reveled in the splendor that is this dish.  So, so good.  Heavenly, even!  I tasted some of my friend's trout, and that was also very tasty, and I'm not even a huge fan of fish.  I was really excited to try the truffle mac n' cheese, but surprisingly, it was probably my least favorite thing of the night.  It was just okay... definitely not the party-in-my-mouth that I was expecting.\\n\\nService was prompt, friendly, and 100% on-point.  Everything was appropriately-priced, worth every penny, and actually a great value.  I don't think anyone had any complaints.  At one point, a manager came over to our table to converse and see how our experience was going.  I couldn't quite hear the conversation, as I was at the other end of the table, but she seemed to be very personable and engaging, and our friends were smiling and laughing with her.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, Jodi got a little confused with splitting the tickets.  That is the only issue that we had the entire night.  She explained to us that it was her last night (unfortunately!), so we're just going to blame it on that.  To avoid the issue though, I would simply suggest explaining what you will be paying for, as you order it.  It makes it whole lot easier, once you get to the end and people are trying to take responsibility for what appetizer to take care of, etc.  Besides that everything was 5-STAR all across the board... epic win!!

I'm originally from NY, but went to school in Atlanta, so I always get annoyed when people up north discount Atlanta and all that it has to offer.  I had guests in town during the July 4th weekend who were skeptical as to how great the food was down in the south and I seized this perfect opportunity to prove them wrong.  Needless to say... they were blown away (& I'm not just saying that... my friends left the restaurant saying, \\"that was amazing.  who would have thought.\\" TOLD YOU SO)\\n\\nThe dishes here are light and taste organic.  My friends were surprised that the dishes weren't doused in butter, like they expected it to be (stereotyping is BAD, people!... but if you want classic heavy southern food, go to community q BBQ hehe).  The portion size was just perfect, so we didn't feel disgustingly full after our meal.  I got the saturday dinner special, which was the red wine braised short rib, and it was amazingggggg.  I know the picture I am attaching makes it look burnt, but it wasn't.  My iphone is just not skilled enough to capture how awesome it was.  The other memorable dish was the salmon steak - the rice pilaf under the salmon was the shining star because it was so lemony and light (mmm carbs).  I saw that many people were saying that it was pricey and for Atlanta, maybe so, but compared to the north where everything is ridiculously overpriced, I thought the prices here were spot on and I didn't mind \\"splurging\\".

It's a lot of food and comes in a togo bag by default. And well, what you pay for is what you get. Breaking it down: the naan is chewy with nice char marks that are the hallmark of a good naan. I want to try the garlic one as well, but the regular one is fantastic. As for the curries, I can't name what they are exactly, but they do have two distinct tastes. That being said, it didn't feel that impressive either as the vegetable curry just looked like frozen mixed vegetables mixed into curry sauce and the chicken curry was thin with 2 chunks of chicken but that's it: there's no body or richness to the generic chicken curry and so the flavor profile of both is a bit flat. But for the price, all that food is a college kids dream. The rice pudding at the end of the meal is a great palate cleanser, as the sweetness helps remove the curry overtones from your mouth.\\n\\nThe owner is really nice as he gave us complimentary soda after seeing one of our guys pay for someone else. They also messed up our order, but quickly remedied that situation (instead of 2 orders they only gave us one).

I might have been warier due to its dubious location--there are several strip malls along 185th, which increase in quality and newness as you move northward from Baseline Rd. to Sunset Hwy...Mio Sushi, though, is pretty far south.  \\n\\nAlthough the outside environs are unimpressive, the inside of the restaurant is small and cute--clean and decorated appropriately for a sushi bar.  Two sushi chefs and an assistant were at work behind the counter, with two hostesses holding up the front end.  For lunch on this day, our party of three ordered a bento combination ($6.95), two sushi rolls (the dragon roll and the rainbow roll), and four pieces of nigiri sushi.  \\n\\nThe bento box was not up to expectations: the salmon teriyaki was dry and the sauce was not flavorful enough; the tempura batter was lumpy and not crisp, and the veggie gyoza were mediocre.  The nigiri sushi were adequate, but nothing special.  The sushi rolls (at $7-8 each) were not bad, but quite small.  What we had ordered left us still hungry, so we asked the hostess if the chef would prepare us something else--his recommendation/creation.  Unfortunately--and this definitely warrants loss of one of the stars--this does not seem to be a viable option at Mio Sushi, as the hostess repeatedly referred us to the standard items on the menu, suggesting we get the ordinary sashimi combination.  This kind of negates the whole point of having a sushi bar and a sushi chef, no?  I mean, I get that this is a chain restaurant and not haute sushi, but I don't feel like it should be that difficult for a decent chef to concoct something original (or at least more so than your run-of-the-mill slab of salmon on rice).  \\n\\nHaving had our special order request rebuffed, we resorted to ordering a tobiko mako (okay) and unagi nigiri (had the consistency of mush...there goes another star), and a Dynamite special, which is supposed to consist of baked scallops, octopus and clams, but instead was a soupy disaster containing mostly onions and mushrooms.  The tab came out to $50... for that sort of value, I think I might rather have had some $5 Trader Joe's sushi."},{"name":"Manuel's","address":"310 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Overpriced, food is mediocre.

Boston is known for its High Quality Seafood and these are one those Seafood Restaurants. After walking around the Harvard campus for almost 45 Minutes I took a Cab over to the North End, looking at all the Beautiful Fountains, Patterns and Statues while trying to find this place, I found it on Salem Street. One thing is that you have to be here early cuz 1. its a very popular place and 2. its really small, so I was 3rd in line being behind a couple from San Diego and a group from Austin, Texas.\\n\\nAs soon they opened up we headed on in, it was small there were tables for about 4 or 5 groups and 12 Booster Chairs at the Bar (Which is where I sat). There was also an Oyster Bar by the window where the Waitresses Shuck the Briny Delicacies and there was a Marlin hanging above the Window. My waitress (I believe her name was Aubrey, who had a tattoo of a Seal on her Arm) gave me a menu and I looked it over. While I was deciding what to get I had a tall glass of Harpoon Cider (it was like a Spiked Apple Juice, Crisp, Sweet and Refreshing. Something to enjoy in the Fall). \\n\\nChoosing from so many different Seafood Delectables and choosing from a big Array of Oysters, The dish that I was intending on getting (Dayboat Scallop Crudo) wasn't there so I chose the Octopus Salad: Grilled Octopus (They said it was Pan Roasted but I thought it was grilled) with Roasted Cauliflower, Hazelnut Romesco, Whipped Labne (another way to say Greek Yogurt), Espelette Pepper and topped with some Micro Greens (Octopus was Tender and Crisp, Cauliflower had a Nutty Bite, the Yogurt was both Rich and Sour, the Romesco was Piquant and the Micro Greens gave it some Color).\\n\\nThe one thing that I came here for was the thing that everyone keeps talking about: The Lobster Roll (who doesn't love Juicy and Tender Lobster Meat crammed between a fresh bun). a lot of People and Websites told that this place was to have the Best Lobster Roll in all of Boston. You get your choice of getting it Cold with Mayo or Hot with Butter (I chose Hot with Butter) you also get a big amount of Fresh Cut Fries or a Salad as a Side, I decided to get the Lobster Roll just by itself). When it came out I was in Awww of how much Lobster was in it, it looked as if they used the meat from 3 or 4 Lobsters. I couldn't even start at the Side (to the amount it would've toppled over, every Piece Counts), I had to start at the Top (Rich, Tender covered in a good amount of Butter and I loved the crunch of that Toasty Roll). I think that my Cholesterol level went up by a lot (although I had to overlook one tiny Sliver of Lobster Shell which they said happens once in a while).\\n\\nThat roll was so worth paying $27 for, I enjoyed myself here so much I'm so glad I got here early so I could avoid waiting a long time. I suggest you come down and Dive in and indulge on a Lobster Roll or the Lobster Spaghetti. This sure beats Red Lobster anyday, this place has made me really (Seafood) Differently."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Highly recommended, unbelievable portions, great service, friendly workers, best meal we had in Boston.

Second, it was 95% batter and onions, and 5% seafood. In other words, the \\"seafood\\" pancake was really bland.\\n\\nAnother thing we ordered was the beef soup. The presentation was nice. It had a variety of vegetables, some pieces of meat, and some potato noodles at the bottom. It looked good, but the taste was quite the contrary.\\nThe abundance of vegetables in the soup was all texture and no flavor.\\nThe soup tasted as if the meat wasn't washed thoroughly.\\nThe soup also tasted like it was all salt and nothing else.\\nIn other words, it was pretty bland.\\n\\nHowever, I will say, the service is good.

We asked the server to check the dish for us because we thought it didn't take too much time for the chef to prepare two small plates. But the server replied that our dishes were all set because it's after 7pm and they weren't serving dim sum then (but we ordered before 7pm, so it shouldn't be our problem). We didn't want to order another plate anymore, so we asked the server to give us the check, and cancel the plates that never came.\\n\\nHowever, I checked our bill and saw that two plates were still on the list. I told the server that he didn't cancel what didn't come, and he double charge the radish cake (we only ordered one radish cake instead of two, and not until we pointed out the plate on our table did he believe us). Then we waited another 10 minutes for him to adjust our bill.\\n\\nThen I looked around the restaurant, it was Friday night and the tables were about 80% full, but there were only 3 or 4 servers!

Once we got our schedules together, we made a reservation.\\n\\nMy [now] fiance and I came back on a Saturday night, and we started off with drinks. I had the pomegranate margarita and later, the Mexclarita, which was more fragrant than sweet/sour. Really good, though! He had La Unica, which is more like a traditional margarita, on the rocks. \\n\\nMost importantly, we got the table-side guacamole. I think this is some of the best guac I've ever had! Our server brought out a pepper blend for my fiance to add to his portions (he would have ordered it spicy if I wasn't there), and he loved it! We ate the whole bowl in a matter of minutes, and really had to ration the last parts. The spoon may or may not have been licked...\\n\\nI have to note that by this point, we could already tell we didn't get the true Rosa Mexicano experience on our last visit, like Michael said, and we were definitely getting it this time. Totally different experience in a short amount of time.\\n\\nI got the salmon this time for my entree and it was perfectly cooked, and the flavors were on point. It had some heat from the poblanos, but not too much (I'm a spicy food wimp). I loved the corn and kale that were mixed into it, and it made me feel like it was somewhat healthy without sacrificing flavor.\\n\\nFiance got the tablones (short ribs), and he devoured them. They were super tender and flavorful. We also got a side of brown rice with cilantro in it, and pureed black beans. Everything was well seasoned and was great leftover! They also brought us a side of tortillas to try (best corn tortillas I've ever had), and salsa to make our town tacos. But I ended up eating the tortillas by themselves with a little salsa... Seriously, they are that good!\\n\\nFinally, we had dessert: I got the churros and loved the raspberry guajillo and chocolate dipping sauces; caramel isn't my thing. I wish I had saved those for breakfast because they would have been fantastic with hot coffee! Fiance had the tres leches and he really liked it. It wasn't my favorite, in part because I really don't like milk, but the strawberries and berry-hibiscus glaze were really good!\\n\\nOur server was great, as was the busboy who made our guac and helped refill our drinks several times during the night.

I had to scoot my seat in twice in the few minutes I was there to let people through the main entrance - the proportions of which seemed more fitting for a back exit! Decor doesn't seem to be their thing either. I was surprised by tables and chairs that were more fitting for a diner than a fine seafood restaurant.\\n\\nThen there was the problem of their poor supply of seafood. They were out of lobster meat even though it was only 6:30 on a Saturday evening! Now I don't know about you, but the North End probably receives the greatest bulk of its patronage on a Saturday evening and they're telling me there's no more lobster?! \\n\\nThe hostess was not all that polite either and didn't show up until after we decided to finally seat ourselves after standing, waiting and ultimately feeling ignored by everyone that seemed like they worked there.\\n\\nWhile I'm sure the food has much to offer given the rave reviews, I must play devil's advocate and say that until Neptune gets a better floor plan, learns how to more effectively match their food supply to the demand of North End patrons - the inclusion of cocktails wouldn't hurt either - and give their customer service a major overhaul I will have to rate this as I would any other sub-par restaurant, 2 stars. \\n\\nIf you expect good service, comfortable eating conditions and a fully stocked menu Neptune is not for you."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"131 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Flour Bakery ALWAYS seems crowded - doesn't matter what time it is.

I felt robbed. Some of the dishes were below mall food court quality. And some of the dishes were so small, the photos look like it was taken after we had eaten most of the food and the waiter moved it onto a smaller plate to save space on the table.\\n\\nThe menu mentions 3 lb live lobster. From the texture of the meat and the shrinkage, it was not a live lobster. The lobster was no where near 3 lb and I think some pieces were missing. \\n\\nWe ordered the crispy chicken which was probably a little more then a quarter chicken. I am guessing half a chicken with a lot of the meatier pieces taken away. The dish was not hot and looked a bit air dried.\\n \\nThe spicy salt pork chop. The seasoning was acceptable but the meat quality was very strange. The texture was off. I am sure it was pork but there is something funny about it.\\n\\nThe honey garlic spare ribs. Not much meat and the flavor was average. I would say this dish and the pork chop were at or below mall food court levels.\\n\\nThe fish maw and crab meat soup. I think the crab meat was under witness protection because I couldn't find any. The taste was okay.\\n\\nThe brocolli stir fried squid was okay. A little bland. The brocolli was a little hard but both a preference thing. The squid was tender and not chewy.\\n\\nI ate at this place a couple of years ago and it was okay. Acceptable for the price but this time it was way below. I am surprised it is still in business.

As I drove past The Imperial, I saw a truck parked just outside its front door and a fair amount (10-20) of people gathered next to it. From a distance, this appeared be a food truck ... but one I didn't recognize. (If you regularly see my reviews, you'll notice a theme: I love food trucks.) As I parked in the lot across from The Imperial, I noticed that this was the La Empanada truck I'd heard about earlier in 2011. The truck had its own Kickstarter page (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1338724600/lets-get-la-empanada-truck-on-the-road) and hoped to raise $7,500 in hopes of being able to open to the public within a few months. Unfortunately, I failed to keep track of its progress, so seeing it was a total surprise. I'm glad that I saw it, though, and that I tried some of its food.\\n\\nThe truck works in conjunction with Black Bean Deli (more info: http://honestfare.com/big-announcement/). Since keeping track of this project slipped my mind, I forgot about a lot of the specifics until I ordered my food. Then, it all came back to me. I love Black Bean Deli, so I was sure to enjoy anything and everything that this truck produced. And, of course, that's exactly how it turned out.\\n\\nAs I waited in line, I conversed with some patrons of The Imperial who came outside to get some food. At least a few already had eaten and were in line to get some more food, presumably because it was so good the first time. One guy in line said that he had tried the Buffalo Chicken empanada and that it was very good - he highly recommended it. There was more on the menu (I didn't get a picture of it), but I trusted this stranger's opinion and went with the aforementioned empanada ($3). The menu also had a few dessert/sweet empanadas listed, a few of which I could not at all resist. They were pretty small - maybe 1/2 the size of the \\"regular\\"/dinner empanadas - but that doesn't matter much, since I mostly was here to get some dinner. I tried one of each of two different dessert-like empanadas; one had bananas and Nutella in it, and the other was a PB & J empanada. Each was $1.50. So, for a total of $6, I got my dinner and a few sweet treats. That deal is hard to beat. The woman who took my order and got my food was exceptionally friendly and packed everything neatly for me (I took the food home; I live only a few blocks from The Imperial). I already was very impressed even before I took a single bite.\\n\\nI dug into the food the instant I got home. As that one guy told me, the Buffalo Chicken Empanada was AWESOME. The two smaller dessert-like ones were, as well. The chicken one was hot and fresh and not overwhelmingly spicy. (It also came with a really good blue cheese dressing.) I really enjoyed the dessert empanadas and definitely will be ordering some more of these if/when I see this truck out again, which hopefully will be sooner rather than later.\\n\\nThe best bets for right now, in terms of finding out more about this truck as well as where it'll be and when, may be to check out its main website (http://www.laempanadatruck.com/ - as of right now, it is not fully operational), Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Empanada-Food-Truck/198475063544049?sk=info) and Twitter account (http://twitter.com/#!/laempanadatruck). One \\"tweet\\" on said account mentions that the truck will be outside of Washburn Imports/The Imperial next Sat. night, so check that out if you can. I surely will be there, myself. As more information becomes available, I'll do my best to complete this listing. The FB page mentions that the truck primarily may be based out of Winter Park, so that's where I'm listing it for now. I can't find a phone #, but the URLs I've provided should be more than enough for Yelpers to go on. Track this truck down and enjoy!"},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a guy place.

It was delicious and I was SO jealous my husband ordered this and not me.\\n\\nI ordered the Chicken-Fried Trout, gribiche, fines herbes, radishes, pickled carrots. Hate to say it but NOT good at all. They gave this to me with a bunch of butter lettuce cups and said to put the fish in there. This was not stated on the menu and I did not want to play with my food this evening. The fish was so fried all I could taste was the breadcrumbs and the oil. I do not think this it the correct fish to be preparing as \\"chicken fried\\". Sounded great when I read it, but when it arrived I was super disappointed. They should remove this from the menu immediately. Totally not worth the money.\\n\\nTo end the evening we ordered the cheese plate which had Raw cows milk cheese, raw sheep milk cheese and a blue cheese. There were some toasted covered in sugar hazelnuts on the plate that I wanted to buy in bulk and eat every day. The crackers they served this with reminded me of high end cheeze its (this is not a bad thing at all mind you) and it also came with a rhubarb jam that rocked. \\n\\nEven though not everything was perfect I would still recommend this place for a nice romantic dinner.

Again, the bar was pretty empty when we went in, but got real busy in a hurry, and Becca handled the room with ease.

Similar pizzas from other Needham places are tasty, washed in delicious tomato sauce, and adorned with generous amounts of cheese, onions, mushroom, spinach.

The first time we went to one taco it was great.  After raving about it to our friends, we went back (with our friends) and it was blah at best.

For the entree, I decided on the Sampler, which came with a cup of gumbo, some jambalaya, and a crawfish pie.  The crawfish pie reminded me of a Cajun empanada, and was my least favorite of the 3 items.  It was still tasty, but the other two items had a terrific depth of flavor.

First off we made reservations and when we walked in we were stared at by the workers as if we were aliens. Needless to say we were seated quickly. When we were seated our server was really dry and really didn't inquire at all, this was my first time and I feel like she assumed I had been here a million times. So we checked the menu out and noticed that there selection wasn't very deep at all. So we checked the menu out and picked our meals. My girlfriend chose the rotisserie chicken meal and I ordered a t bone with mac and cheese. About ten later our waitress came back and told my girlfriend that they were out of chicken and left to grab a menu. She brought the menu back and we chose the rattlesnake pasta. About ten minutes later she again returned, this time to tell me that they were out of mac and cheese, which really made want to just leave. Since it was my first time here and I wanted to try it I switched it too a loaded baked potato. After that my girlfriend asked her if they did anything for birthdays and she said no. Which I found alittle strange, because most places do something. We proceeded to eat, the found was cooked perfectly from what I ate, which was some of both meals. If there was anything I would change it would first be the service, then having something like bread or something while customers wait to eat, passionate servers, and please something to make customers feel like there alittle special on the birthdays. Overall food tasted great, service sucked tremendously, and adding something while customers wait to get the meals would be a great addition.

Everything about the meal was perfect, from the moment we arrived and took our seats at the bar to the moment we left. \\n\\nBear in mind that this review comes from the most unlikely of Neptune patrons - a VEGETARIAN. An actual vegetarian that doesn't eat seafood (don't get me started on people who profess to be vegetarians \\"but also eat fish\\"...). I thought I would be at a disadvantage in an oyster oasis like this, but it turns out I was in for the meal of a lifetime under the fine care of owner Jeff, who is a total sweetheart and a hotter version of CSI's Gil Grissom. It's true.\\n\\nWe arrived at around 10pm on a Saturday night and the place was filled with diners. We started off with a few glasses of Albarinho and worked our way down the menu. Jeff, who I didn't even realize was the owner until I overheard someone asking him how long the place had been open, was incredibly humble and charming. I could not believe that the owner of a restaurant like this was behind the bar taking orders and serving us like a regular joe. \\n\\nAfter I told him I was vegetarian he asked me what I liked on the menu and then offered to make me a combo plate of the things I had picked, making a few suggestions along the way. At no point did I feel like I was going to have a meal that was any less awesome because it didn't have seafood in it - I had full trust that the food was going to be amazing and I was completely right.\\n\\nMy plate (bowl, actually) arrived and was heaving with goodness - each item was perched on top of the next in a lovely display of coloured foods. There was the crispy gnocchi, which were boiled and then pan-fried like pierogies to give them a crunchy exterior, the green garlic broth kale with fresh peas, butternut squash puree & braised bok choy, apple slaw and avocado & grapefruit salad. Every last bite was incredibly yummy and unique in flavour and texture. \\n\\nI also loved the decor at Neptune - it was in a really nice part of the city that felt very European and cozy, and dark with soft lighting and a sort of sexy, jazzy feel to it. \\n\\nThis goes down as one of the best vegetarian meals I've ever had at a predominantly meat-centric restaurant!"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My friend and I get out of the airport to our good friend waiting (with a sign) to whisk us away to our first ever dining experience in Portland.

It is a rich, dark, interesting suitor that whispers to you with a deep confidence that entices and thrills. \\n\\nIts historic German Village charm crashes head first into a hip, slightly bourgeois scene making the diner feel cultured, sophisticated, and merrily pretentious (a good thing when you're about to drop $150 on small plates). This combined with an excellent wait staff and a decent selection of beers and wines plays right into the hype. \\n\\nYou have heard the hype, right? Barcelona is sexy. Barcelona is cool. Barcelona is an experience. \\n\\nHowever, that is about where my love affair with this place ended. The appetizer arrived and suddenly Barcelona is beginning to appear frazzled, fumbling with my buttons, and visibly sweating. We ordered 3 meats and cheeses recommended by the staff and an olive plate. The food was quality, this much is true. However, the meats and cheeses we had didn't marry well and the lack of anything complex or challenging on the plate made it seem boring and lazy. The olives were good, but it was seriously just a huge bowl of olives. \\n\\nThen came the entree. Now Barcelona was spitting a little when it talked and mumbling unintelligibly under its breath. Things were coming apart. I ordered the cerdo and my girlfriend ordered the paella barcelona. Everything on the plate made perfect sense, was expertly prepared, and cooked well. However, there were fundamental flaws in both dishes, a theme that we recognized from the appetizer. There was a lack of flavor, balance, and proportion in everything that we'd tried so far. This hinted that perhaps Barcelona isn't quite the suave, sophisticated lover after all. \\n\\nBut what about desert? Surely even Barcelona as bumbling and suspiciously unaware as it appeared to be could get desert right. Wrong. We ordered the tarta de santiago which is a spanish almond cake topped with dulce de leche, whipped mocha ganache, and crushed marcona almonds. How could this go wrong? First, the balance of the flavors was, well completely absent. The chocolate drizzle paired with the mocha ganache completely overpowered all of the competing flavors. Any complexity that might have been present was lost to the sweet chocolaty madness that was this cake. Also, I expected that the cake being topped with dulce de leche would at least be moist. Again, wrong. This cake was dry. A complete miss and unenjoyable. \\n\\nI wanted to like Barcelona, I did.

Since we were halfway through beers elsewhere, they said they would take the party behind us and would seat us when we came in so long as there was room. All this to say - EXCELLENT customer service on an obviously crazy night.\\n\\nWe tried the Cedar Plank Salmon (and other things, but this one took the cake) and agreed it was the best we'd ever had.

I really enjoy Tijuana Flats for what it is - a quick fix for tacos - and finding out that Tibby's and Tijuana are owned by the same people was the little push I needed to finally visit last Monday.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately and the service for the most part was pretty good, aside from the fact that we hadn't visited before and were politely (but still...) pushed to order something quickly. Nothing on the menu sounded that thrilling and perhaps we deliberated a bit too long - I hardly think 10 minutes to get drinks and order is a long time, but whatever - on our three entrees. I was a bit taken back that absolutely nothing except for a half Po-Boy came with a side, so I ended up going with that so I could try a little of everything.\\n\\nThe Eggplant Tchoupitouias my friend ordered was essentially eggplant parmesan, which was disappointing. The creole sauce tasted an awful lot like tomato sauce and the dish was sort of cold. She gave up on it and left about half of it on the plate. \\n\\nThe Seafood Gumbo was cold and not spicy at all. My girlfriend tried loading it up with hot sauce, but there's only so much you can do with a bottle of Crystal. The bowl they served it in was very shallow and she was still starving after finishing it.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, I ordered a Po-Boy - crawfish, specifically. The half sandwich was an adequate amount of food, but the bread tasted old, almost as if it had been baked early that morning or the day before and then left out on the counter all day. It was tough, chewy, and not ideal for a sandwich. Like everything else we ordered, the sandwich was not warm at all, which is alarming because the crawfish were breaded and fried. Who knows how long any of our entrees were sitting around before we got them - thinking back on it, the food did take quite a while to come out.\\n\\nI ordered the Andouille and Cheddar Grits as my side and was quite perplexed by them. If someone had placed the bowl down in front of me and not told me what I was eating, I would never guess that they were cheese grits. The texture reminded me of a fluffy souffle; one without cheese, I might add. It wasn't awful, but they were far from the best cheese grits I've ever tasted. \\n\\nWe decided to skip dessert since we unimpressed with everything we had ordered.\\n\\nAs if all that wasn't enough, I developed horrific stomach cramps and other nasty symptoms shortly after leaving.

Just me and my fiancee, so if your group is bigger you may have trouble.  \\n\\nThe place was poppin'!  Right off the elevator is the bar area which is quite large.

Split an interesting appetizer with my fiancee - the Kung Pau Calamari.  HUGE portion!  We didn't even get close to finishing it off.  The calamari was also not deep fried (just an FYI so you aren't expecting the traditional dish).  Very tasty.  I then switched up my Collins for a glass of red wine and ordered the filet mignon with \\"Rogue River Triple Cr√®me Gorgonzola Sauce.\\"  Unbelievable.  I cannot do this dish justice.  The meat was perfect.  I could cut it with a fork, it was so tender.  The sauce was outstanding.  Completely elevated the whole meal to another level.  It also came with some vegetables and (I think) some sort of potato.  The whole thing was well worth the price!  We finished off the meal by splitting the creme brulee.

Once we finally gave our order, we received our drinks, and then we waited, and waited, and waited. Two waitresses walked by our table 5 times and never asked if we needed anything, nor apologized for the wait, nor offered a thing.

I was so excited to get my breakfast, I was like a kid waiting for the ultimate dessert of my dreams. Except I regretted my order with every bite. Every bite was so thick. I swear I thought I was eating a jar of peanut butter. It tasted so good but my jaw was so tired. The Juggernaut wasn't all that bad. It had a good waffle to chicken to egg ratio and everything tasted freshly made. No complaints there. Oh, we also ordered a side of hash browns, which turned out to be a ball of deep fried hash browns. Good? But really greasy. \\n\\nWe both agreed that we needed to give Superchefs another try.

After we ordered, a Korean woman came in and things started getting better, but I'm not sure who the chef was in the back. \\nWe were extremely surprised at how amazing the food was. We were disappointed that there wasn't a fired grill on the table, but everything that came out was so delicious and authentic. We received about five pan chan (side dishes) that were mostly all kimchi something and we also ordered: vegetable jun, edamame, bulgogi, spicy chicken, kimchi cheegae, and bi bim bop.

Located in Commercial, this place hits you with a mind boggling array of Nepalese food, that keeps you craving for more.\\n\\nWe ordered chili chicken (Chicken fried with onions and peppers), bhutuwa (chicken/ meat marinated and then pan fried), choila (shredded chicken simmered in a very typical nepalese spice mix) and momos (think dumplings :) ) from the starters menu. Each and every dish was tasty in it's own unique way! For example, the chili chicken had really deep seated flavours, where as the choila had subtle but lovely notes of flavours. You would have to try it to know what I mean! The plate of momos came with about 12 servings, and was perfect to be shared between our big group.\\n\\nFrom the mains, we had Khasiko maasu (Piquant goat meat in sauce) and Kukhuraako maasu (boneless chicken curry). If you were from the same part of India I hail from, your instincts would be telling you that Khasiko Maasu would be more enticing that Kukhuraako maasu. And guess what, instincts seldom lie. This place had hands down the best goat meat I have tasted in Vancouver. Every time I think about this place, I am reminded of the aroma of goat meat spread on steaming basmati rice I had here. Life seldom gets any better, trust me.\\n\\nThe interiors were beautiful, and they had pleasant music playing. The girl serving our table was super friendly. They do not have anything on the desert menu, possibly because desserts are not part of a typical Nepalese meal.

The coffee marinated rib-eye with cojita cheese and the chipotle horseradish aioli  was so good. I wish there would have been more (I'll get to that in the bad! ). The outdoor patio looks like a postcard but is anything but appealing in this 100+ weather. They also have happy hour on the weekends which surprised me and meant free chips and salsa, half price apps, and some dollars of various libations. And by the way, this place made one of the best, but probably the best its just that i don't like to give anyone too much credit, Mexican martini I have ever had.  Have one or six if you go in, you won't, or might, regret it. \\n\\nBad: The service was, as others have mentioned, is kinda on the slow side considering how many people seemed to be bustling around and about in the restaurant. And in terms of actual taste, Garrido's failed with their black beans. They put a very noticeable amount of anise in the beans which meant when they picked up our plates there were two piles of black beans with a tiny scoop missing.  Someone needs to revisit  the \\"if it ain't broke don't fix it\\".\\n\\nBadder: I'm never going to be the person with the biggest appetite at the table, but Garrido's is a place where I really have to work to be full since they give SO little for what you pay.

The appetizer menu has some good choices on it but I didn't find the fried okra especially flavorful. For the main course I went with their homemade sausage and brisket. Unfortunately both were a bit dry. In sausage this can be ok, but for brisket it makes the meat tough to handle. The assortment of four different sauces to try with the meat were nice. Their sweet tomato based sauce was pretty good. For side dishes I had cole slaw and macaroni that were both pretty good.

Total, we've tried a few of the apps and entrees and are perhaps in a better position to judge.  It should be noted that our service was gracious and prompt the second time.  Much appreciated!\\n\\nI had the glazed pork....so scrumptious.  It made me wonder not only how they cooked the meat to get it so tender, but where it was from.  I would say that it was fatty, except that that might be taken in a bad way.  It is not meant to be, as the meat was tasty and the fat, I dare say it, even better.  Made me remember fondly previous porks in places were pork is still fatty.  Is it possible to get meat like that in grocery stores?  I need the hook up!! \\n\\nWe also tried the duck confit, which was good, but not as mind blowing as the pork.  The skin wasn't crispy, though maybe it wasn't supposed to be and we were just assuming it would be.\\n\\nI had the celery remoulade for starters and it's just my type of thing, though I probably should have shared it, portion wise.  Crispy julienned carrots and celery root with luscious crab meat chunks in a lovely dressing, that had just the right touch of tang.\\n\\nOn our first visit we tried the happy hour burger, which is unquestionably a great deal.  The meat was so delicious and so flavorful.  In addition, we tried the fois grap app, and I don't feel fit to judge.  Not a fois gras connoisseur, it's probably the second time I had it and I have to admit, it doesn't do it for me.  I can perceive that the texture is creamy, but my palette almost can't discern it's the flavors through the fat. So don't listen to me, try it if that's your thing and don't get disgusted if it's most definitely not!\\n\\nDesserts: worth every calorie."},{"name":"The Sound Table","address":"483 Edgewood Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The Cocktails are Delightful!

It was spicy, and I don't even like spicy food, but I didn't mind. I think I ate red curry tofu. I believe it was the tofu that really set it off. How many ways can you make tofu? A lot, apparently.

We had requested a window seat when we made reservations and were able to get it.. Our table was decorated with tiny hearts and words that said \\"Happy Anniversary\\" along with a card that said \\"thank you for celebrating with us\\" with signatures from a few staff members. It was a nice touch. The view from our table was awesome. We were able to see the river and a bit of Mount Hood. The service was excellent. The dinner was a bit overpriced for the portion given, but was still very good. For dessert, we were able to get a small chocolate cake for free because it was our anniversary and it tasted delicious! The restaurant was quite noisy but since we were here on a Sunday, it was very packed so the noise level was understandable.

This place has me hooked without a doubt. Been coming here 3 years & I continue to come! It's always a treat! I've tried the falafel wrap, falafel & chicken wrap, lamb over rice, chicken over rice, combo over rice, fries, & hummus. && let me be clear they were all DELICIOUS! I especially love the chunks of fresh cucumber & tomato on the wraps. && THE HUMMUS! It's so authentic yet simple! I typically order a container just to take home. The pita bread is always served warmed & it's super yummy. As far as the protein, you won't be disappointed. It all comes hot & well seasoned. They also have the option to call ahead which makes getting in & out during rush hours a piece of cake.\\n\\nThe service is always impeccable! The cashiers & cooks are always friendly & greet you with a smile. Even their cash only 6th street location serves up great service despite all the drunks. && PRAISES UP that they aren't stingy about the sauce or charge extra for it. GOD BLESS YOU HALAL BROS!\\n\\nOverall, the food is amazing & affordable!! Service is consistently great! The portions for the over rice options are huge. You'll definitely have left overs if you're a moderate eater. This place really has a killer thing going for them. Great food & great quality. \\n\\nThe only thing I have bad to say about the place is the PARKING! OMG! It's terrible! There's literally 4 maybe 5 spots, one is over a curb. The place is right off guad so getting in & out is ridiculous on its own. It's hard to park somewhere else & walk without having to pay or run the chance of being booted or towed. If you live on campus or in west campus, it's probably not too much trouble to walk. But for commuters or visitors, good luck!!

I could easily end my review right there. But here are some details: The prices are the same (if not lower) as your typically supermarkets BUT the quality is considerably higher. The selection on everything is spectacular. The deli has exotic meats that you would have a hard time sourcing anywhere. The butcher has the freshest meat you will find outside of your local butcher, except reasonably priced. The cheese department will make your mouth water and the plentiful samples will cure your curiosity. Here is my advice to any shopper; If you desire something just ask. You want a little less cheese then whats in the fridge, just ask. You need ripe avocados so you can make guacamole THAT night just ask. You want some fat trimmed off your steak, just ask. You feel a little lost and cant find your favorite can of vegetables just ask. They will literally stop what they are doing, walk you from one end of the store to the other and locate anything you need. These people are here to serve you and they love doing it. Two small negatives that I will share with you and what reduced my rating from a 5.0 to a 4.8 are the prepared foods cost and the long wait times to check out. The food that is prepared is very good, from sushi to chicken parm to Indian food, you name it and they have it BUT be prepared to spend a little extra for that convenience. And checkout; its not that the lines are long its that there are no \\"baggers\\" so it takes little extra time to get through check out. I usually try to jump in and help but it still takes time. After all is said in done you leave feeling like you got a great value on some good looking produce and some wonderful meats all to remember that your car is parked under a covered structure.

It took about 20 minutes to get to the front of the line, and we were told the wait was about 1.5 hours (classic Portland brunch). But, it turns out, they serve their whole menu at the bar, and it's first come first serve, so we decided to wait for that instead. The waiting area is a standing area that also serves the full menu, so we got some coffee and ordered there before moving over to the bar.

Very tasty cocktail, the burnt orange adds a pleasant aroma with the scotch rinse adding a slight taste of peat to the bourbon. \\n\\nFirst dish was the marrow bones, it was cooked perfectly and spread easily unto toasted baguette slices. However, the orange marmalade was completely unnecessary, it completely overpowers the taste of the marrow.\\n\\nNext up was the escargot, it came with goug√®res *cheese bread balls* and the combination of both was excellent, the garlic sauce adds a nice flavor, as it should. The green salad on top was a bit much, especially with whole pieces of flat leaf parsley mixed in. \\n\\nI decided to try some of the oysters before happy hour ended, they were fresh with a saltwater taste. Oysters were prepped well since I did not have to use a fork and just popped them into my mouth from the shell. \\n\\nUp next was the crab and celery root remoulade with a side of white bean and parslied ham salad. The salad was fresh with the carrots and celery root crispy but it was far too spicy to be able to taste the crab, I was only able to feel the crab in my mouth but otherwise I would not have known there was crab in the dish. Since the dish was so spicy, I could not taste the full flavor of the white bean side dish but the beans were tender and had creamy sauce. \\n\\nI would have given this place 5 stars if it was not for the Cotes de Castillion Bordeaux I ordered.

I like the grilled chicken or the lamb sandwich. The soup is different every day and is a pretty large portion. Or sometimes I get one of the sandwiches in a salad (greens instead of bread). The breakfast egg sandwich is also yummy.\\nAfter trying many pastries here, I have decided that there are things better than the sticky bun, though I do get that from time to time. I love that the Back Bay location never runs out of sticky buns, as was often the case when I frequented the Central Square location. But I will say that the sticky bun is greatly improved when taken home and toasted in an oven. \\nMy favorite dessert item is probably the carrot cake, though I do feel like the size of the slices has gotten smaller over the years. I also really like the hazelnut nisquoise (may have misspelled) cake and the pies. They are around $5 give or take. All their scones are good. The hazelnut cookies are to die for. And everything almond flavored is usually on point. \\nCheck out the takeout dinner special.

Normally we wouldn't have minded the wait but being a birthday celebration we had hired a car for the night so we were on a time crunch or pay the charges for going over. That being said, staff is AMAZING and attentive. We ordered and my entree was not what I ordered. Although it was a communication error on my husbands part, they still apologized to US.

The lobster roll with chips, a pickle, and a drink will run you about $20 after tax and all that good stuff. Not a cheap lunch, but oh so worth it. For around the same price, you can try the trio which is essentially a sampler. Half a shrimp roll, half a crab roll, half a lobster roll. \\n\\nOn this second visit, I went with the trio and a small lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was pretty good and there were some decent chunks of lobster, but it's not something you NEED to get. Of all the rolls, the shrimp one was actually a pleasant surprise (and the least expensive). I'm not really that into shrimp, but it was really fresh and they piled on the shrimp. It was really really good. The crab roll was pretty good, but somewhat forgettable. The lobster roll was as good as ever. \\n\\nEven though it's a regional chain, I have no problem saying that Luke's has the best lobster roll in Boston.

I had a beef chimi and chicken enchilada with black beans and rice.  The beef in the chimi was superbly seasoned, and they also added poblano peppers to add some extra pop.  The chicken enchi was also terrific, and made with creamy authentic queso and cotija cheese.  The only thing I would improve was the black beans, which was served more as a bean soup than a nice thick side of beans how I usually like them, but still tasty.\\nThe service here was extraordinary!  I was served water, chips, and salsa immediately.  I was tended to every couple minutes for more water and salsa for the chips.  The waitress also gave me additional salsas to try and said that she makes them all fresh in-house and has about 7 different salsas.

It came highly recommended and very rarely does that meet my high expectations, but this was an exception.  They do a decent job of capturing the French bistro vibe.  I like the decor and the floors, although the light blue walls are a bit strange.  In Paris, I feel like most bistros use warm colors like a tan or dark red.  But other than that, I thought the ambiance was great.  Our server was Amanda who was not only attentive, but friendly and very knowledgeable on the menu as well as the wine list.  I was very impressed with the wine list as well.  There were a few French types I would have liked to see but they're hard to get their hands on.  I also felt all of the portion sizes were perfect.  If you want a bunch of small plates to share, I would recommend that.\\n\\nWe got the steak tartar.  The knife cuts on the dish were extraordinarily great.  I love that they let the patrons mix themselves.  As opposed to capers, they have a caper jam on the side, which I thought was very creative.  It comes with cubed bread, which is interesting although I ended up tearing it in smaller pieces to make it bite sized.  The bread itself was just okay.  We also tried the pork belly, which was a special that day.  All pork belly is good by definition and this was no exception but there was nothing that blew me away about it.  They have two foie preparations and we decided to get the seared preparation upon Amanda's recommendation and I am very happy we did.  It was exceptional.  The pairing was outstanding with apples and a house made waffle.  My favorite dish was the bone marrow.  I am a purist when it comes to marrow and this is not one where they remove the marrow, mix with stuff, and put it back in the bone.  This is pure marrow awesomeness with an herb salad to cut through the richness.  It's the second best marrow I've ever had and that is saying a lot!

I like going here mostly for the milkshakes, which are some of the best that I have ever had. I especially like their Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Milkshake, peanut butter is my kryptonite, LOL. One of the best things about their shakes is \\"happy hour\\" from 2pm to 4pm every day if I remember correctly. Their shakes are half-off during this time, myself and two other people got some shakes at this location not too long ago and I think I spent $5.50 and my shake had so much Reese's in it that I had to eat the last part of it at home with a spoon:) \\n\\nThe burgers at Steak N Shake are excellent also, in my opinion they are on par with a Wendy's hamburger, which are the two best fast food chains (for burgers) that I have been to. The only thing I don't like about Steak N Shake is their fries; they are very small and \\"stringy\\" although my dislike of their fries won't keep me away from going here. \\n\\nThe customer service at Steak N Shakes has always been very good and the location at Roswell Road is no exception, this company must really emphasize customer service with their employees and I always try to mention it to the manager when I am in there and our server does a good job.

After getting off early at the hospital, and not eating all day, I figure I'm hungry. And I must draw upon my love for Man vs Food ... and I decide. Today is the day to visit Thurman's cafe. (Actually I had this planned a few days in advance).\\n\\nFinding the place downtown wasn't hard at all. Luckily I found parking right in front. It's just before 3 pm ... surely I can get right in right? Of course not! Even then, I had to wait probably 30-40 minutes, and I wasn't in a big group! Wow this must be a popular place. I sit patiently, thinking about the task at hand.\\n\\nI was there for one sole purpose. To defeat the Thurmanator. What is it exactly? Originally developed for hungry bodybuilders after their competition, it's one massive creation. It's two 3/4 lb patties, bacon, three kinds of cheese, another 1/2 lb of ham, turkey and other deli meats, with mushrooms and onions. Sure, it sounds a lot on paper, but wait until it comes out.\\n\\nThe waiter looks at me, goes are you sure? I'm like yeah, that's why I'm here! He shrugs and goes alright. I ask him, what, you don't think I can finish it right? He sizes me up and flatly states \\"you'll have no problem.\\" And he disappears off to place my order.\\n\\nNow while I wait (takes a while to make such a massive creation) I look around. It's quite the nice atmosphere honestly, and it's clear that there are many longterm customers there. The lady behind the bar just about knew everyone there. And the decor was interesting, there were many dollar bills hanging. I really should have asked what that was for.\\n\\nAnyway the meal comes out. Well two meals I'd say, maybe four. I think I calculated it out to be nearly 4,000 calories, if not more. I look at it and figure a plan of attack. Do I try massive bites? Cut it up? I go with the split in half method, and attack the hamburger patty.\\n\\nOh my goodness, that is one good hamburger, so juicy, so perfectly done, nicely seasoned. Honestly if it wasn't for the sheer massiveness, it is one of the best burgers I've had. I fly through half of it easily, taking pictures along the way. The guy next to me chuckles at my photography, pointing out I'm a tourist. I shrug it off and keep digging in, eating fries here and there, and downing the bottomless coke.\\n\\nAttacking the top half of the burger was a bit harder. I had completely forgotten about the 1/2 lb of deli meat piled on top. Now this didn't taste so good ... I've had egg on burger, but ham/turkey I don't think is a good combo. I start slowing down, badly. With a quarter left, I wonder what I've gotten myself into. I sweat not from the heat, but from the effort.\\n\\nAfter 50 minutes, the end is in sight. I have just a few bites remaining. At this point, it all tastes the same, except well, the last bite. That was a bite of ... VICTORY! I finished off my plate, burger and fries in all. After previously tackling the 1 lb BLT at Tony's I-75 and the 40 taco challenge, failing both times, I have success!\\n\\nI've been thurmanized. My life is complete. Well, that day anyway. So do I recommend this place? Yes! Great atmosphere, delicious burgers. And if you want to get a thurmanator, I recommend splitting it with a friend. Or three. Have some fun =)\\n\\nPS. I visited back in Dec 2009 and it was also the day they received word from the Travel Channel that they would be featured in their top 101 places to chowdown in North America, with a poster and everything.

The place was packed and the waitress told us it would be a 45 min wait... Whaaa?? Its not even lunch time.. We weren't even hungry so the wait wasn't a big deal at all. So, I gave her our phone number and we decided to walk around North End. We left and grabbed a Cannoli at Mikes Bakery and only 20min after we placed walked into Neptunes we got the call. Your table is ready! \\n\\nYay, so like I said we weren't THAT hungry so all we ordered was 1 hot lobster sandwich (to split between the three of us) and three Kumomoto Oysters. The Oysters were delicious, nice and creamy w/ a ton of flavor.. Now the Hot Lobster Roll was definitely the best Lobster Roll I've ever had. The bun is soft and butter and the lobster sooo fresh tasting. Even the fries that come w/ the roll are delicious. My sister and cousin who went to another restaurant to try their lobster roll said it didn't even compare. \\n\\nSo my recommendation is to go to Neptunes, get a lobster roll and don't feel bad for paying $25.00 for a sandwich.

I don't understand why people say the burgers here are bad!

I was visiting Boston so I had plenty to keep me occupied while I waited for that highly anticipated phone call telling me my table was ready. Also, the ambiance inside (while VERY cramped) was charming and I was into it.\\n\\nNow for the food... We started with some oysters. This was honestly the highlight (something raw). Loved the variety + detail in describing every oyster and clam to really help you identify what you will like. The rest of the food reviews go downhill from here... \\n\\nNext was the Clam Chowder. Probably the biggest disappointment. This is New England. If you can't manage to make a good cup of chowder, you should not have a 3-hour wait at your restaurant.  The chowder was VERY WATERY and the potatoes were raw. My Boston-bred boyfriend also agreed.\\n\\nWe next split the Scallops entree. The scallops were raw in the center, but besides that, the dish itself was confusing. The flavors and components they put together just do not make any sense together. Very disjointed dish. Not one bite taken felt like a well-balanced bite of food.  I fear that the chefs have not learned the art of balancing the 5 tastes.\\n\\nIt's a shame.

They have a good variety of cheeses and all of the ones we bought were super delicious. Not only do they carry cheeses from all over the world, they also carry great local cheeses as well. All of their cheeses are solid and whoever stocks their inventory knows what they are doing. That being said, their cheeses can get pricey, but you definitely pay for the quality and care that goes into making the final product. Service was okay, the person helping us was nice, but could have engaged with us a bit more than just wrapping cheese for us."},{"name":"Stanford's Clackamas","address":"8416 SE Sunnyside Rd","city":"Clackamas","stars":"3","text":"The food is always good but the service is awful.

I suggest you order your apps and entrees with your drink order (you'll have time to decide!) or you will wait a lot longer.  Sip sparingly - Drinks aren't refilled often if at all.  I actually walked into the bar and asked the bartender for a refill on our waters.   I've been to several Stanfords and this place is not a good representation of the rest.  The hostesses are pleasant and the atmosphere compliments the food - I wish the service did.  Do yourself a favor and drive to Lake O or even the airport!  The Mac and cheese is awesome.

You don't have to yell at a kiddo that way to make a point. And I don't give a rat's ass how frustrated you are, you don't yell at them right in front of a customer.  It's degrading, rude, and flat out unprofessional. Maybe she was having an off day.

The food is great (most importantly), the atmosphere is trendy and fresh, and the service is great. This is another \\"fast casual\\" type restaurant where you order from a few choices of meat (or vegetarian) and then are free to load up with toppings from a multitude of different vegetables, sauces, spices etc. I always get the chicken and cheese. They hand you your wrap (a pita circle with your meat choice and cheese if you like) and you then walk over to the buffet type displays filled with veggies like carrots, spinach, lettuce, banana peppers, cabbage etc. You can also add sauces like ranch, their own Phat chili sauce, a Peruvian spicy mayo, and a buffalo style spicy mayo. They also have most common variety's of hot sauces, olive oils, vinaigrette etc. The coolest part about this is rather than instructing someone from behind the counter what you want on your wrap, you do it all your self. You want a lot of lettuce and just a little peppers, you are in complete control of how much and what goes on your wrap. The food is cooked quickly and is rather inexpensive.

The nice lady on the phone said that was fine, so I headed over from my office a few blocks away. I needed some place with lots of light, good wine and food where I could focus and get a lot of work done. This was a perfect fit. Everyone was great until I encountered my waitress. She not only took over 15 minutes to even greet me, but has proceeded through our interactions with dead eyes, a sense of impatience and a rather shriveled WASPy and markedly unfriendly smile. I've ordered wine, an entree, dessert and tea, and let her know expressly that I will be here for a couple of hours. Once she knew this she made a point of ignoring me. Sadly for her, she is not aware that I am an outrageous tipper at the slightest sign of kindness and humanity from someone working in the service industry, having spent 15 years in it before I got a writing job. Each time she visits my table she's flatline -- keeps looking my outfit up and down, and basically reminds of why I hated high school. This place needs to reconsider what they're willing to pay their service and keep an eye out for hiring sorority girls -- probs not a good move.\\n\\nI am very humble and non-demanding as a customer -- since I worked on the other side of the table for a decade and a half I am wary of becoming just another a-hole someone has to deal with.

Well, do read on.\\n\\nJavier's is the only late night restaurant within walking distance from my house, so greasy Mexican food sounds incredibly appetizing after a long night of debauchery and suckling beer directly from our kegerator. When a group of us somehow manage to stumble the 3 or 4 blocks to the restaurant, we are often welcomed with a very long line. The place gets quite bumpin' around 3-4am and the police end up showing up more often than not. With such a huge following, you'd expect the food to be great.\\n\\nIt really isn't anything special, and is only a slight step above taco bell. The food is flavorless, greasy, and the ingredients are very questionable. The only thing that I've had that is halfway decent is the fish taco, but even that can be too breaded and not fishy enough.\\n\\nThe main reason I knocked this place down so many points was because of the quality of their ingredients. My girlfriend once got food poisoning there, and vowed to never return. Of course, accidents happen and food poisoning can just be a fluke at times but I decided to stop going there after my roommate got food poisoning on a completely separate occasion. How does some place like this even pass a health inspection?\\n\\nAnyways, questionable ingredients + sick girlfriend/roommate + flavorless, greasy food = 2 stars.

But if you're looking for authentic Mexican in Boulder, this isn't the place to get it. The Best of Boulder Mexican? Far from it.\\n\\nFirst indication of a problem. Nothing on the menu sounded appealing to me. I adore Mexican food with a passion, but I couldn't find anything that sounded good. Lots of chimichangas and quesadillas and pick-2 platters. Finally chose the cheese enchiladas because the description said that they were cheese and onion enchiladas.\\n\\nReal cheese enchiladas do indeed have onion in them, so I thought, great, they will make them the correct way. However, no onion. No identifiable onion whatsoever. Onion and cheese are an excellent combination, but despite the description, no cebolla for me :-(\\n\\nSweetie got a chimichanga. Chimichangas are fried burritos. This one wasn't fried. Or, it had been pre-fried long ago, then reheated right before serving, because the outside was very soggy. The meat inside was kind of dry and somewhat tough. Not particularly good.\\n\\nThe beans were very good. Yum. The rice was fine.\\n\\nThe prices seem high for what is actually received. I got two little cheese enchiladas on a huge plate. The rest of plate was covered in thin smears of beans and rice.

Not here... The wine was definitely room temperature, and Pinot Grigio does not taste particularly good when warm. We complained to the waitress and she gave us a frozen bottle cooler, which helped for the 2nd half of the bottle.\\n\\nBoth of us ordered burgers, which was a mistake. Mine was fine, but my friend's was dry. However, that wasn't even the issue.\\n\\nWhen another waitress was putting my plate on the table she knocked over my full glass of wine onto the table. She apologized profusely and ran off to get a towel. After cleaning up the mess, she asked if we need anything else. I had to ask her to replace my glass (shouldn't they offer it? I wasn't the one who knocked it over). She said of course, and I did promptly receive a full glass of (luckily chilled) wine.\\n\\nThen things got bad. We shortly discovered that my friend's iPhone stopped working. Turns out, some of the wine got onto her phone as well and the speaker stopped working. Speaker phone worked, but she couldn't hear anything unless she had the phone on speaker. We told this to our waitress who got the manager. He wanted to take her phone, reset it, and try charging it (because a full battery makes the speaker suddenly work after water damage?). Although this didn't make much sense, she complied. About 10 minutes later, he came back with her still broken phone and told her to come back the next day if it's still not working. \\n\\nNow, we were in hurry at this point. When the waitress brought the (full) bill (with no deductions for them royally screwing up), we asked her to have the manager write a note or something so my friend could prove 24 hours later that it was not her fault and that this happened. She went to the back, didn't take our credit cards with her, came back and told us that the manager's name is Derek and he would be there the next day. My friend asked again (and she was very nice this whole time) for a note or some sort of written documentation. We also had to tell her to take our cards as we were in a rush and she didn't seem to remember that we had the bill on the table. We never did receive the note, and my friend will be back there tonight. Hopefully, there won't be more issues."},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me start off by saying that I have been to Garridos manytimes before and I never had an experience like this one.\\n\\nI walked in with a friend to grab some lunch and as it's almost past 1:00pm the place wasn't that busy.  After we got seated and had the drinks order take care of, I was hoping to get some chips and salsa which did not happen. Again, as this wasn't my first time here, I thought of reminding the server about the same.\\n\\nAfter 10 mins, we had our server stop by for taking the food order. When done with taking down the order, we were asked if we wanted some chips. This is where I was kind of shocked by the difference in the level of service I got from Garridos  compared to my previous experiences. Maybe its the tone in which we were asked this question, we defintely felt out of place.\\n\\nThough I reluctantly said 'Yes', I was thinking to myself why were we the only people who was asked this question? I was never asked this question before during any of my prior visits to Garridos.\\n\\nWe waited patiently giving the benefit of doubt to our helper and 20 mins have past by.

I want a runny egg, not one that's stiff from sitting in a container on the steam table for 20 minutes. Same goes for the fried chicken - it's pre-fried and because of that can loose it's crispiness when covered in gravy. And BTW - if you're just assembling my food to order instead of cooking it to order, do it faster dammit!\\n\\nSeriously, the food is delicious.

Got a call about an hour later and ended up at the bar near the back.\\n\\nOur bartender/waitress Adriana was the best. Asked us what to drink. I had a beer in mind but asked her what she would suggest.

They had both East and West Coast oysters, but we picked all East Coast.\\n\\nNext up was the clam chowder.

I think it not being so thick made it less heavy.\\n\\nFinally, we talk about the main course, the lobster roll. As much as I like mayo, Adriana recommended taking it hot, with melted butter. She hasn't steered me wrong so far, so I went with it. What a sandwich and came with a large serving of fries. By golly, what a game changer. They did not skimp on the lobster. I took a few of pieces off the top and there was plenty left. The bread made the difference as well.

We love coming here because its near by and the sandwiches are really good. (My favorite is the ABLT with fries.) The only thing that knacks on me is that twice now, the hostess has not been to friendly when we asked to not sit under the spotlight, so we chose the half-booth and we waited about 30ish minuets before a nice young man come over and helped us!

We went for brunch and started with a tasty mary and the Kentucky peach. Both were solid drinks. Then we ate the mustard cabbage dish, the radicchio, the polenta and sugo, and the fried chicken, egg and cheddar biscuit. Literally everything was incredible. The radicchio took us by surprise and was even better than we thought it would be. Tends to be a long-ish wait because we tried to come on a couple different days and the service was a touch slow. However, everyone made up for it by being very accommodating and friendly. Definitely cannot take any stars away. We will be coming back next time we are in Portland.

As we were on our way, we had no idea where we were going to eat.  All we knew was that the birthday boy wanted Italian food. About 15 miles out, he announced the place he wanted to eat.  It was NOT Fratelli.  After parking we walked to the location he had pulled from his memory banks and it was  P A C K E D.  So we convinced him to go to another place for some cocktails while we found another close Italian restaurant.  After searching Yelp!  We settled on Fratelli.  \\n\\nUpon arrival the establishment was pretty crowded and we still had 15 minutes until our reservation time.  We opted to sit at the bar and enjoy some vino.  At the moment of our reservation time, we were escorted to our table.  \\n\\nLet me tell you, this place is small and they have a limited staff, but they were very attentive and engaging with us and everyone around us.  \\n\\nOur dining order was taken promptly and we ordered some appetizers to get us going.  The Appetizers arrived within about 5 minutes of placing the order and our meals arrived within minutes of us finishing the appetizers.\\n\\nMy partner had the gnocchi, I opted for the Flat Iron steak, the Birthday boy chose lasagna and his partner went with a salad.  All the meals were cooked perfectly, tasted wonderful and served promptly.  After dinner we ordered three desserts to share between the four of us.  They were out of this world.  After drinks and dessert, the bill came to just over $120 for the two of us.  I would say the price point is about right for the area, but a little higher than it should have been for the portions.\\n\\nAll four of us thought the food was wonderful and the service great.  I make a point NOT to read other reviews before writing my own, and so now that I have written my review, I read some of the recent ones and can only imagine that perhaps there are good nights and bad nights at all places.  We will probably go back again.

We've been here a few times and like the atmosphere.  Big open sports bar with nice outdoor seating.  We had 1 visit that was unfortunate where we ordered wings that came out cold.  They brought us another plate and still not hot.  We weren't happy, but told our waitress not to worry.  She called her manager over since she knew it was an \\"off night\\" and the manager comped our entire check.  This was above and beyond and really made an unfortunate night okay for us.  We will continue to go back given how well they showed genuine concern for their customers.  \\n\\nThis is a typical TGIF type of place.  The portions are not huge.

Our new favorite spot. Plus, their name stamp on the food is the coolest."},{"name":"Mantra Restaurant","address":"52 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"If indecisiveness is your weakness, you may feel slightly inadequate when perusing the menu. Filled with many innovative and enticing options, we become so entangled with choice that we opted for the five course tasting menu paired with picks from Sommelier David Singer (Best Sommelier of Manhattan 2000, formerly of the Federalist, Boston).\\n\\nFrom the onset, the experience was as magnetic as the setting is avant-garde - a $3M transformation of the Old Colony Trust Bank (by Office dA, former Harvard Design School) that includes marble walls, high ceilings with rich moldings, and an opulent hookah den. To tease the palate, a small roasted red pepper and tomato cappuccino arrives, with a small dollop of crme fraiche. Warm rounds of soft naan are also served, complemented by an addictive cashew and cilantro spread. \\n\\nWe start with the Tuna and Salmon Raita, a combination tartare served with sesame lavash. The salmon is lightly marinated in a yogurt and ginger concoction, and served molded over a thinly sliced cucumber. The tuna is a phenomenal mix of flavors - the delicate essence of grapefruit, counterbalanced by the slight sting from flakes of red pepper. We indulge in the tartare with a couple of selections from the martini list - a slightly fizzy Bellinitini (peach nectar, vodka and undercurrents of champagne) and a very fruity Strawberry Shortcake. Brilliant.\\n\\nNext to arrive are the scallops, served over a capsicum coulis and curried lobster, mushroom and endive salad. The subtle curry flavor brings the capsicum to life; the scallop is seared to perfection and captures a delicate essence of the sea. A pinot gris adds a honeysuckle and tangerine undertones. \\n\\nHowever, the show stopper is unquestionably the fois gras, a dish so robust and complex that it could easily stand alone as a main. The multiple layers of taste are extremely versatile: the fois gras, served warm and slightly crisp on the exterior, melts in the mouth; the ravioli bursts with hearty lobster meat, which adds diversity and is further complimented by a touch of rich goat cheese; and the cherry reduction rounds the dish with its tart after-bite. What better to go with this magnificent creation than a 20-year Graham's Tawny Port? This truly approaches culinary perfection.\\n\\nA short interlude of peach sorbet purifies the palate - delicate enough to transition to the fish. The clay-oven roasted Monkfish and the pan-seared Black Bass both outdo themselves. The Monkfish is served on a bed of wilted spinach and capsicum chutney. The Black Bass, trapped, not farm raised, lies amongst a saut'ed artichoke and purple potato mixture. A Hen-of-the-Woods mushroom is an accompanying delicacy, with a frothy pea emulsion to add an intricate, but subtle, dimension to the dish.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, the game selections are of similar high standards. The lamb is cooked just enough to preserve its velvety texture, served alongside fingerling potatoes, wilted spinach, and deep cinnamon-colored au jus. The Venison Tenderloin also offers a wonderful combination of flavors - bitter broccoli rabe offsets the molded aloo jeera (potato and cumin seeds), and all three sit within a racy peppercorn reduction.\\n\\nThe close of the tasting menu continues to exert its incomparability. The warm pumpkin soup and vanilla kulfi dessert, with a thin black and white sesame tuile, is light yet hearty - a perfect autumn finale. The chocolate tasters menu is an indulgent trio of Grand Marnier Chocolate Mousse, thick and rich dark chocolate sorbet, and a very dense chocolate truffle cake, presented in art-deco style with candied oranges and pulled sugar. We indulge in a glass of Veuve Cliquot, and for a few minutes lose all contact with the surrounding world.\\n\\nBut hours have passed and the tables are slowly being rearranged. A strong beat emerges from a newly set DJ area and the mystique of the night takes over where our culinary experience has ended. It has been a flawless evening of cuisine excellence. Mantra is truly unparalleled class and style; a rare find in Boston."},{"name":"C&J Cuisine","address":"183 S Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"2.5","text":"I am a crab rangoon queen!
