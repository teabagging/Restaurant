He told me of many things, but of great interest to me was a place called \\"Mitti gaddhe.\\" His tales were fanciful, extraordinary, and surely had to be false. Yet, curious, I had to see with my own eyes and taste with my own tongue these things he spoke of. As I was leaving he had whispered two cryptic phrases in my ear with a raspy voice and a strange accent:  \\"Khuroos-E-Tursh\\" and \\"Kothmir Samana\\". \\n\\nI went with a companion, a world traveler with experience in such adventures, for who could say what dangers we might face? The structure was of stone on a major thoroughfare in town. Cautious, we ventured inside, the aroma's wafting through the room were delightful. Summoned to a table we perused the script written in a tongue long forgotten. We found the two cryptic phrases and the charming and good humoured manservant clucked in what we assumed was an approving manner.\\n\\nThe dishes were beyond compare!  Chicken in an almond cream sauce, subtle and oh so satisfying. Salmon rubbed with garlic in a korma sauce, splendid. The basmati rice seasoned perfectly, a salad with a light fruit dressing. This kitchen resonated with Nirvana.\\n\\nA lunch worth traveling a continent for. If this is what is served for lunch, I'll have to return to sample the dinner.

A  cafe latte runs about $4, flavored latte $4.50 (hazelnut, vanilla etc..). Pour over's range anywhere $2.50 and up. The beans aren't burnt and the coffee isn't watered down. The atmosphere is perfect for those like me who enjoy a good cup and an assorted array of reading/ writing. \\n\\nI tried the Hazelnut Latte today and am very pleased with the base used which has pieces of hazelnut in it! The milk wasn't hot enough for my taste but take in account I'm looking to over heat in this cold weather landscape especially fresh off a plane from LA.

The restaurant purchases mostly local ingredients, which is great because you know it's fresh. The menu changes daily, so you can try new things every time you go. And the food is amazing.

The food was delicious, we had their house-cured beef with pickled local morels, endive, grapefruit and fennel salad, crispy pork trotters with salsa crudo, gnocchi with morels and rabbit, tagliata di manzo, and a camomile and honey yogurt pannacotta with rhubarb and almond biscotti for dessert. All the dishes were fantastic. The wine was a bit expensive for me to just enjoy a glass (we split the house wine), but otherwise I felt it was completely reasonable in terms of prices for the food we were getting.\\n\\nI especially liked how the two tables we were between also ordered the 7-course meal, but received slightly different things - I liked knowing that the restaurant didn't just have generically plated foods for everyone who ordered the tasting menu option.\\n\\nThis is the perfect place for a nice evening out.

I'm not sure that I would want to drink a sixer of these in one session, but it was certainly a different sort of taste treat!\\n\\nFor food, the menu isn't huge but there are some basic pub-grub options as well as several more gourmet (or possibly experimental?) options.  I ordered the Cubano Sandwich (pork shoulder, hot soppressata, raclette, pickled jalapenos, aioli - $9), and while it certainly wasn't the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had it was satisfying enough.

One of the weird things about Atlanta is that, in addition to all of the soulless corporate chains, you have \\"local\\" businesses that are all just mini-chains. For example, a Farm Burger in Decatur and a Farm Burger in Grant Park. A Kale Me Crazy in Inman Park, a Kale Me Crazy in Decatur, and a Kale Me Crazy in Grant Park. A Grindhouse Killer Burgers in Decatur and a Grindhouse Killer Burgers in Grant Park. \\"Mix'D UP\\" is similar: a location in Grant Park and a location in East Lake. And the weird thing is that these \\"mini-chains\\" all have the same minimalist modern architecture. \\n\\nMy fries were fine, but could have been a bit crispier -- they were kind of a moist lump upon receipt, not as a result of the brown paper bag. I ordered the regular burger, which was also, fine, I guess. I ordered it medium, and it was cooked closer to well-done. It's a large patty, for sure, but wasn't particularly flavorful. There was cheese? American? Cheddar? I'm not sure what it was, actually, because they don't give you a choice. The bun was a bit weird: toasted, but the bottom of the bun was cracker-like, so it crumbled while eating, as if it was either a bit stale or they toasted the wrong side of the bun -- perhaps a combination of both. \\n\\nI guess I might come back here to have some fries and a beer, but I doubt I would seek it out again, especially if looking for a place with a good burger. \\n\\nIt's a pity that inner Atlanta seems to lack real independent businesses, perhaps because of greedy landlords making it hard for them to stay afloat.

Dessert is extra though discounted if you do the buffet. Ultimately we opted to order from the menu for a larger selection. \\n\\nWe tried the pretzel nuggets to start. Think deep fried pretzels. Very tasty though the frying makes them more of a crispy donut texture versus pretzel texture. The waitress asked if we wanted beer cheese with them; we said sure.

Park in the lots out front and to the sides.\\n\\nI surprised myself by discovering I hadn't yet reviewed Desta (Ethiopian for \\"Happiness\\") - I guess I've been eating here so long I just assumed that I had already done so. This is my go-to place for Ethiopian cuisine - something i was really unfamiliar with (I had tasted the famous, spongy injera bread as one of my short-term neighbors growing up was on a team of archeologists in the region, forced out by the civil war - later my neighbor across the street from my previous home was from the State of Eritrea and they delighted us with some home-cooked meals - at that point I was hooked!). Injera is one of those things you either like or you don't - the consistency and strong yeasty smell can be off-putting. Once you have a few bites it's easy to get sold on it though, so don't give up.\\n\\nThe building that houses Desta is a bit quirky with dining on the second floor. There's a bar and a patio that becomes quite full when it's not too hot. This place has limited seating so either come early (on weekend evenings) or visit during off-times. The menu is broken up into Breakfast, Appetizers, Signature Entrees, Kitfo (Ethiopian-styled steak tartar), Fir Fir (soaked injera), Sandwiches, Pasta/Rice, Salads, Vegan, and The Rest. The vegan here is surprisingly good and recommended pretty much by all my vegan friends. This food is very spicy and can be very hot (which I recommend) so they offer Beer, Wine and Spirits (don't trust the servers on the mixed drinks though - be very specific on how you want cocktails that are more than \\"Gin and Tonic\\" to be made and be prepared to wait. On one occasion one of my friends received a margarita made with vodka. I tired the Ethiopian Beer - St George - it's an Amber that goes well with the spicy food.\\n\\nMy favorite items on the menu are the platters - the Vegetarian Platter provides a great amount of variety including shiro (chickpea stew), misir (spicy split red lentil stew), ater (split pea stew), dinech wot (potato stew), gomen (collard greens), tikel gomen (cabbage), salad, azifa, beets and tomato fit fit - you pretty much get to taste it all. My favoirte is the gomen - I love greens. You also get your choice of bread and I recommend you first get an appetizer with injera to make sure you like it and if so, roll with it (you'll understand the pun there when you see it).\\n\\nOn this occasion we started with the Gomen-Siljo Dip - a blended dish of tofu and gomen seasoned with garlic, ginger, hot mustard and olive oil. We got both the pita and the injera - it's a bit like eating a chunky hummus and quite good. I also recommend the Tomato Fit Fit.\\n\\nWe also ordered the Meat Lovers Tibs (cubed meat sauteed in spice blends with onions, tomatos, peppers and spiced olive oil - I ordered this extra spicy and its very similar to a hot curry or vindaloo) - this is a huge platter of meats (you choose 3 different), the bread (injera) and your side. We ordered the gomen and fit fit (thinking that we needed something green to offset all the meat). There's plenty here for 2-3 people. This dish, regardless of the meats you choose, is the proverbial BOMB!\\n\\nOn another occasion I've ordered the  lamb Tib extra spicy (notice the red?) - delicious. and a less saucy version of the chicken. But really, everything here is so good you won't complain.\\n\\nService here is very good - they keep bringing out the pita or injera as you use it up and they're good about keeping your water full, which you'll need - oh and I should mention that the food is designed to be picked up with a piece of bread - you tear off a piece and pinch the food with it, popping it into your mouth. This is interactive food at it's best (and make sure you only eat with your right hand). \\n\\n(also posted to my food blog)"},{"name":"Banya Japanese Restaurant","address":"8166 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Delicious rolls!

After being \\"bombarded\\" by a door dash driver obviously running behind schedule and and other guests trying to sit with their party (we weren't asked to sit down to get out of the aisle or even received a proper greeting for that matter), we were finally seated. After having a seat and ordering some waters, another waitress approached us and asked us to move to a booth because we were seated in a section that was supposed to be saved for a party. The waitress then randomly stated the restaurant would give us free milkshakes. My wife informed her that was not necessary, however she insisted. After packing up the stroller underneath the table, we finally were all seated at the booth. I ordered the shrimp burger with the side ceasers salad and the Kurt Reynolds with Jamison (very strong I might add *smiley face*), while my family ordered their meals, and we ordered fries and onion rings for our appetizers. The shrimp burger was excellent. Seasoned well, fresh toppings, brioche bun was nice and soft, and their cajunaise sauce was fantastic. After being satisfied with our meals, my wife told the waitress that we would take them up on the milkshakes if the offer was still available us. The waitress proceed to ask us what we would have. I ordered the nutella + toasted marshmallow milkshake, which tasted more chocolate than hazelnut, however decent nonetheless. My family also ordered their milkshakes. After being ready to go due to our baby getting fussy, we asked for the check. That's when we saw we were charged for the milkshakes. My family and I being confused for the charge asked our waitress for an explanation. She informed us that the other waitress told her that she only offered one milkshake and not milkshakes for our group. After informing the waitress that we only knew about/ordered the milkshakes because of the other waitress she informed us that she thought she heard milkshakes as well.

I really liked my food that day. It was a doughnut (everything is a doughnut here) with fried chicken, a fried egg, white gravy, cheese, bacon and jalepenos. The gravy was thick and house made with great creamy texture and flavor. The fried chicken was quite tasty and all in all the dish was very nice. In my trips back however I found the entrees have not matched that first experience. My husband and I have tried the doughnut burgers. They are always cremated, very dry and flavorless. The toppings are good enough, fresh vegetables, fried eggs etc. The pimento cheese has a strange, cake-like texture which I wouldn't recommend. We have also had the fried chicken dinner. The mashed potatoes are good and the fried chicken is average. \\nThe problem is everything is just so, so, so greasy and so heavy. I always feel sick after I eat there. I understand that the doughnut is their thing. But there is an overall lack of balance in the food as the doughnut is so heavy itself and then it is topped with such heavy, rich ingredients. \\nNow the desserts are a different story. If you're looking to go for a rich, fatty and delicious dessert theirs are good. I especially like the banana cream dessert that is topped with white icing, banana pudding and crush Nilla Wafers. They also have some good Thursday night drink specials. The atmosphere is fun and there is a nice patio if you like to sit outside. Service has always been good. \\nI am the type of reviewer who takes everything into account but I base my reviews mainly on the food. If you're looking for some seriously heavy hangover food this may be for you. The portions are large and I haven't had anything bad there.

I'm not sure if it's a limited time offer, but extra rice is free so I definitely did not pass up on that. \\n\\nThe food came pretty quickly and it was a lot of food. The teriyaki chicken had a good flavour. The tempura was 2 pieces of prawn and yam, and was a big highlight for me. The prawn was moist and juicy. The tempura batter was quite light. The Minced pork and tofu with spicy sauce reminded me of mapo tofu. It was not very spicy at all, but had a nice kick. This went very well with the rice.

There are two sizes of sandwiches you can get: S-which is not a slider as you're used to, but a small burger about the size of your palm, that is about 1/2 inch thick and loaded with delicious and fresh ingredients.  And a full-sized sandwich, which I did not have, but I imagine it's quite rotund.\\n\\nOn the Tuesday night I came in (about 8), there were a few other customers and a mostly empty bar.  Decent selection of beers (both local micro, and national) and ciders.  They also have cocktails like three types of margaritas.  I had a local IPA and it was good way to start off my dinner.  \\n\\nThey had a special that was not advertised that night, but was told to us by a friend: a chinese pork sando on ciabatta with mixed veg.  So I got that and the marinated chicken slider.  Holy eff!! Both of these were incredible!! You can taste the freshness of the ingredients and the flavors just pop! The sauces compliment the meat perfectly.  I like the pork better than the chicken (with delicious house-made pesto), but both were heavenly.  I've been in Portland for two months and I can say that these are the tastiest things I've had yet!\\n\\nMy friend got three sliders and he agreed that, like me, all were amazing, but that chinese pork was the winner of the night.  We also split an order of pulled pork loaded fries, which I honestly could make a meal of, but there's no way I'm ever not going to order at least one slider. Our sliders and the fries left me and my friend absolutely stuffed.  If the price point worries you, fear not.  The flavor alone is worth every penny and the portion sizes are legit.\\n\\nI just can't wait to go back and try everything else the menu has to offer, starting with the sliders, of course.  Go eat here!"},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The best BBQ in Texas. Hands down.

I've been to some other top joints here in Austin and around the country, but Terry Blacks truly nails the art. Plus, unlike other places you 1) don't have to wait in an ungodly line before the sun comes up and 2) the items rarely run out, and if they do, it'll be late at night\\n\\nThe pork ribs are the star here: fall off the bone with an awesome peppery crust. The brisket was also fantastic, but make sure to stay away from the drier, leaner cuts. Also, it gets pretty rich so you don't need a whole lot. The beef rib is a monster and a rite of passage if you haven't had one before. One can be shared between 2-4 people for sure (and also on the richer side). The sausage was really good, but you can get away with ordering an extra pork rib instead. The smoke and tenderness of everything were on point. While Franklins might do a better brisket, this place is a better option if you want to sample everything (and again, if you don't want to wait)\\n\\nThe sides are pretty good, but not worth filling up on. I'd suggest the bbq beans and slaw. The cornbread is also great. The potato salad is very good but too heavy and takes the focus off the star of the meal (the meat). Similarly, the cobbler is nice but hopefully you order enough meat so you're not still hungry for dessert... \\n\\nTip: Plan to come around 3-4pm and make this your lunch and dinner. Load up accordingly and sample the whole menu with 1-3 other people.\\n\\nTip: when you're done, go around the side and ask for a quick tour of the smoke pit.

I love the retro tiki vibe happening here (obviously since it's right next door to a tiki lounge!) and the area that was sectioned off for us was perfect for our numbers. The service was great - we had about three or four servers taking care of us so it was never slow and tables were cleared quickly. The drinks took a while to arrive, but they were delicious so it was forgiven. \\n\\nI knocked it down a star simply because the food was lacking. We went with a set menu, which was \\"buffet\\" style, but we were only given one shrimp skewer and one chicken skewer. We could serve ourselves as much salad as we wanted (the vegetables, cheese and toppings were pretty extensive). There was also a giant plate of smoked salmon and chilled shrimp, but those disappeared quickly as well. They also had scalloped potatoes and risotto, and all the food was served buffet-style. The entire meal cost $40 (tax and tip made it 50), which I thought was pretty steep for what we got. \\n\\nOther than that, the place itself is nice, and is just like any other nuba with a larger selection of drinks. Perhaps it would be wise to check out on my own to sample some of the regular menu. And then off to the tiki lounge!\\n\\nTransit options include the 20, 16 and 14, and there's a parking lot in the back and street parking around the area."},{"name":"Eddie V's Prime Seafood","address":"9400 B Arboretum Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My parents were visting me from out of state and wanted some really good seafood so we decided to make a reservation on OpenTable  on a Wednesday night at 5pm.  There was lots of traffic coming up from the south so we ended up arriving 15 minutes late. \\n\\nEddie V's shares a parking lot with another restaurant so the parking lot already had a lot of cars. Fortunately it was a large parking lot so I didn't have problems finding parking. There was also valet parking too, but it wasn't my thing. \\n\\nUpon entering a winding hallway I eventually got to the servers stand. After checking in at the desk I was asked to wait until my table was ready. Looking around, it seemed to be happy hour and people were slowly trickling in. People either dressed nicely or were semi casual (polo shirts), so I didn't feel it was too formal of a place. It appeared that everyone here just wore whatever they wore at work since it was a weekday.\\n\\nAfter about 10 minutes or so I was seated. The waiter was dressed in a nice white jacket and tie. He asked if the other people in my party were coming and I told him they were on their way. I ordered my drink. Looking around the venue had some people there, but it wasn't crowded. Soon my parents arrived 5 minutes later just in time when my drink arrived. After 10 minutes, we figured out what we wanted and flagged down the waiter. \\n\\nHere is what I decided to order: a crab cake for my appetizer, a warm goat cheese salad for my 1st course, and a Misoyaki halibut for my main course. I also have to add that my mom had a special diet at the time, and the waiter was happy to accommodate her and make changes to the food. Many restaurants don't like to do this, but I'm glad they did here, which is what I like about this restaurant.\\n\\nThe crab cake tasted good, nothing amazing, but it has good texture and taste. The warm goat cheese salad was amazing, and the cheese blended in with the nuts, tasting warm and savory. I never thought a salad would taste so good, but after trying this salad, I'm a believer now. For the fish, I'm not a fish person, but I since this was a top seafood place I would give it a try. The waiter suggested a steak for me, but I figured I could get steak anywhere. And I wasn't disappointed, as the Misoyaki sauce brought out the taste of the halibut in the Misoyaki in a unique way.\\n\\nUnfortunately I couldn't stay for dessert because I had to leave early. I certainly enjoyed the ambiance and the food here. My parents did too and will definitely come back again when they visit."},{"name":"Suya Joint All African Cuisine","address":"185 Dudley St","city":"Roxbury","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent Naija (Nigeria) authentic cuisine.

I actually enjoyed their moist brisket more, just because you get more for the value because you're not paying for the bone.  Their jalapeno sausage was just OK, their cream corn had a hint of cinnamon? the mac and cheese was delicious! \\n\\nTheir BBQ does not need sauce, but they offer 3 options, original, spicy, and sweet.

I'll definitely say some of the reviews are outdated below. I've only come on weekends and never paid a cover. The crowd reflects the area but there's never been trouble or craziness, and everyone's always been pleasant enough!\\n\\nWe always start off by getting our own drinks, but both times the waitresses are very good at swinging by to make sure you've got what you need - even quarters for the dart machines (if you're playing them). They have fancy digitized dart machines that, if you are not so proficient at the game, may confuse you but are a lot of fun. Especially when you beat your partner TWICE. HA! There's also cheap pool on the opposite side. \\n\\nThe DJ pretty much plays current hits and there's often a few people \\"dancing\\" (allegedly) on the floor.

Seasoning on top was on point and you don't even need to add the barbecue sauce. Brisket was melt in your mouth tender and the Mac and cheese, I learned is a must especially when 4 people in a row order it in front of you. It really is as cheesy as it looks. BBQ sauce was a little runny and maybe a 4 star in that department. Ambiance is casual and relaxed, order and pay for your food then find a table. There was a slice bread area with other add ons you could help yourself to. It was about a 10 minute wait on a Monday lunch, this was a great option since the other popular bbq spots were either too far or closed.

They have a few vegetarian options for bfast tacos, and you can get wheat tortilla too.  The egg and ingredients are rolled up like an omelet and it's placed on an open tortilla, then it's topped with green onions, some cheese, and thin potato crispy strips (yum!).  You only get a wee-bit of salsa, but just ask for extra and they'll gladly oblige.  \\n\\nThese tacos are high quality, one should do you just fine, and the Terra w/ tofu and avocado is probably my favorite.

You can tell that the food is made to order and they certainly let the chicken speak for itself and don't add a bunch of spices to it.\\n\\nYou get the option to choose one of their white or dark meat plate variations but can also select just the individual pieces itself. The fried okra was greatness and the the fries were perfectly salted but the macaroni was the sleeper side of the day. We're not normally one to get dessert after a meal, but we got a slice of their chess pie and it tasted very similar to buttermilk pie. The crust was the best part! It was flaky and  melted in your mouth with every bite!

I usually don't write yelp reviews considering I've been a bartender for 10 years and dont like yelp obviously, but I'm so enraged by what happened last night, i have to. I've been coming to the local for over 10 years. I'm friends with multiple employees there. Last night at close, my boyfriend and a few other friends were sitting on the patio, finished with our drinks since last call had already happened when a server with whom I've never seen until last night came outside and yelled at all of us to get the fuck out. She was so rude i said under my breath, \\"Ok we are just finishing a story then we will go. Us sitting here isn't affecting her as a server being able to close.\\" Her response i guess was to go get the manager. When he came out he said the same thing to me. I started to discuss with him how rude they were being. All they had to do was be nice about it. He cut me off, told me he knew who i was and to get the fuck out. I got up to leave and the server started running her mouth again. I went up to her to apologize if I had upset her withk what i said and she told me to FUCK OFF YOU BITCH. I will never come here again, which is a shame because like i said before, I have friends who work there and have been a customer for over 10 years.

Nothing to rave about, write home about, or tell a friend about.  We came here for dinner and the food was okay but way overpriced for the quantity and quality. Also be warned that you might not want to sit outside. We were seated outside for dinner and there were barely any lights so it was quite dark throughout the entire meal. Also since the outside seating area is quite separated from the inside, our waiter didn't even seem to notice us and we had to flag her down or go inside anytime we wanted anything. Really not an ideal situation for anyone.\\n\\nSpicy Tuna Poke $15.00: This dish was probably my favorite out of them all. I love poke and am excited whenever I see a poke on a menu. The tuna wasn't too spicy, which is why it's only at the first level of spiciness, but flavorful. The poke included diced cucumbers, radishes, and crispy wheat berries. The rice was also super good. Usually restaurants will just use regular rice but they used sushi rice which a happy surprise.\\n\\nTea-Smoked Pork Spare Ribs $14.00: Was not a big fan of these spare ribs. The meat was dry and the flavor was odd. The tea-smoked part seemed like it would be a good idea but in reality, it tasted like a burnt tea coating on top of the spare ribs. I would suggest getting something else than spending $14 on four not so good tasting spare ribs.\\n\\nBraised Pork Belly Buns $9.00: Meh. Not bad but not that great. They were okay but kinda small. In a couple of bites the bun was finished and you're left with an empty feeling. Would also pass on getting these again.\\n\\nIndonesian Fried Rice $17:00: The fried rice was actually okay. It was a bit spicy so if you can't handle the spice, I would be a bit weary of ordering this. However, since the spice is not mixed in, you can always push it to the side and mix the other ingredients together. I love pineapple in fried rice because it gives it a bit of a sweet taste to a usually salty dish. I just wish that there was more fried rice on this place since it is a bit pricey for $17.\\n\\nOverall the meal was okay but seemed too expensive for the quality and quantity that we received. Lots of places are trying to do asian fusion and unfortunately, I do not think Meyer's and Chang was a success for us. Also very disappointed in the service since it seemed like we were being ignored.

The coworker I was with ordered the deviled eggs, and when she handed him the ones right off the cart I about fell out of my seat.

My tenderloin was of the quality that I would expect from maybe, your online frozen delivery to your house type system (I wont name names but you probably get my drift).

I ordered the Lobster Benedict (it's only 2$ more than the regular benedict so why not) and, wow!  the eggs are poached perfectly!  How about that.  But then I must digress because the lobster was overcooked - chewy, and looked like they had gone up the street to the market and just bought junk lump crab meat.

The portion size is also generous, and they're perfectly crispy. Could eat multiple orders of this!\\n-ST. JOHNS: I always love to try vegetarian options but this one is a bust for me. The marinated portabella mushroom is sliced instead of left whole, so it feels more like a salad between bread, especially since all the ingredients were a bit room temperature/cold instead of warm.

I am so glad we did. \\nWhen you first drive up it looks a little sketchy and you almost question if you're at the right place. It's located right next to/attached to a gas station/garage. So it's not the best store front, but don't let that deceive you. Once you walk through the door you begin to realize that the exterior doesn't matter. It's what lies within....just like people. Anyhow, cute set up on the inside, great friendly service and above all, the food is fantastic! I had the chorizo hash which is out of this world tasty. So many different flavors going on. The chorizo is nice and spicy. My husband had the blueberry flapjacks and side of bacon- so good. Flapjacks were loaded with fresh blueberries, bacon is thick cut off a slab. No IHOP crap here. We also tried a couple of mimosas. Hubby had the blood orange- yum. I had the beet mimosa. I know, sounds weird, but if you like beets, which I do, then you will like the mimosa. All the juices are fresh squeezed or cold pressed. At least that's what it tasted like to me. \\nWe went around noon so I'm sure this place gets super busy in the morning, but we were able to get a booth right away. They have happy hour from noon to 3:00pm. You can get the bloody Mary, OJ mimosa and other brunch style drinks with a Phoebe twist at discounted prices. \\nWe will most definitely be coming back next time we are in Austin.

Fresh egg and avocado, crunchy tortilla chips, a onion tomato mixture that tastes homemade, and just the right amount of cheese to tie it together.  \\n\\nThe pastor was good, but not quite what I'm use to. They were cubes of pork rather than grounded. The pineapples were there, but much more in the backdrop than in the forefront. Some pieces of pork were chewy, while others were melt in your mouth.  \\n\\nI don't normally order fish tacos, but I decided to give this a spin. The description I saw on the menu said \\"minimal masterpiece\\". They're not far off. There is a serene harmony with this composition. The tilapia stands firm, yet in contemplation amongst its subtle yet enhancing sides. The creamy avocado gives it depth, the fruit and pick de Gallo gives it a bright freshness, while all blending into the tilapia. Don't e Percy this to be a crazy flavored, fusion fish dish, but rather a reflection on the simplistic majesty of the tilapia.  \\n\\nThe flour tortillas are done right. Firm yet pillow soft. They provide a structure while never burdening the jaw with weight or density. They also take on the oils of the dish quite well.   \\n\\nI walked in expecting the usual, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I generally avoid juices, because of the extra sugar, but healthy combination of juices, and drinking my greens? YES PLEASE !!!\\n\\nIt's a small store front and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  I wasn't going to purchase anything yesterday (Famous last words) when I accompanied my friend, but then we were invited inside to wait for her order (with her pup that I had been watching outside).  I love it when places are pet friendly.  We had to wait for her order because they will prepare specialty juices for you and that takes a little bit of time (maybe 5-10 minutes).  \\n\\nSo before long I was cruising their refrigerator for ready made juices, and was ready (or so I thought) to purchase three.  O-Town Punch (Hibiscus, Pineapple, Orange, Ginger), HIPPS Don't Lie (Beet, Orange, Pineapple), and Forever Young (Kale, Pineapple, Green Apple).  I take my purchases up to the counter and the very friendly cashier asks me if I've ever tried the Hipps Don't Lie (I hadn't) and then explained the flavor combination (it's going to be a bit sweeter --- yup just what I hoped for, since while I avoid juice for sugar I also don't much like the KALE or BEET taste on it's own lol), and did I want to try a sample (WHAT??? Yes please). She also explained the other two juices, and discussed with my friend (who was concerned that the Beet one would taste too \\"earthy\\") the difference between the citrus addition to the Beet vs the regular juice drink.  Who knew juices could be so complicated? \\n\\nAfter I tried my sample I was sure the Beet was in fact what I had hoped for.  Now the juices are not cheap .. I paid just over $29 for my 3 options.  That being said you can taste the quality in the juice, and if it get's me to drink my kale (which I don't actually like) and beets (also not a huge fan), I think that's a major win.  \\n\\nin addition to juice they have a variety of other health raw food options as well as juice cleanses.

I loooove samosas so, needless to say, I polished off these babies in record time.\\n\\nThe Fetira (flat bread and eggs, served with honey) was unfamiliar and familiar at the same time.  The round flatbread was cut into triangles and stuffed with scrambled egg.  It was as if they turned the flakiest part of a croissant into a pancake, sandwiched eggs between two pancakes and sweetly brushed them with honey.\\n\\nMy guy ordered the Scrambled Eggs with Prime Ribeye Steak (with saut√©ed with onions, tomatoes, peppers and Ethiopian butter) and a side of injera.  The dish looked like a southwest scramble without the cubed potatoes and it was tasty too.  It was such a generous serving that he couldn't eat all of it.  \\n\\nThroughout our meal, we had Julie mostly to ourselves since most of the other customers were having their meals outside on the patio.

Unfortunately it did not set the tone for the rest of the meal. I also ordered the Alaskan King Crab Legs and Lobster Mac and Cheese. The lobster Mac was dry and lacked flavor and lobster.

In the time that we were waiting, we observed both servers on their phones behind the counter and in the seating area.\\n\\nThe food seemed well-made (though mine was pretty cold by the time my friend's had arrived), but the service definitely didn't make me eager to return.

It's good, but trust me, it's not worth $15. Wine is overpriced as well. It's common for restaurants like this to make huge profit off on drinks that people order. Unless it's a very special occasion or you're trying to impress some hot date you just met, then sure, go ahead and spend $15 to $500 on alcohol. \\n\\nAppetizer:\\nThe appetizer is pretty pedestrian. It's something you can find at different restaurants. There is this place called Alibaba's in downtown that a lot of people for lunch, and they serve the same dolmades for about 3 dollars, but in this restaurant, it is 11 dollars not including tip and tax. The grilled octopus was interesting because it tasted like they boiled it and then grilled. The octopus did not have the fishy taste or the typical octopus texture. The texture was almost similar to a fish or regular meat. It was not chewy, and the outside texture was still crisp. It was a very interesting experience with the grilled octopus. \\n\\nEntree:\\nLamb Two Ways kept the Greek flavor and style, and it showed off it's quality lamb meat in two different style within a stew. It's a heavier dish, and you can tell it's lamb meat. The mizithra cheese matched well with the trahana, and it had a tomato based feel to the sauce. I couldn't get all the ingredients in the sauce, but just think lamb chowder or stew. The balance of the stew was great. \\n\\nArctic Char on the other hand was very light. The fluffy and airy sherry mushroom broth with garlic confit was good. There is a strong lemon or citrus zest to the fish and the sauce, and so expect a lemony fish dish. The fish was cooked correctly and the the artic char flaked slightly like it was supposed to. It was not overcooked. If I had to pick, I would probably pick this dish over the Lamb Two Ways because it's lighter and has more technique involved in the dish than the lamb dish. \\n\\nThe reason for three stars:\\n1. It's very overpriced here for a food that you can get equivalent or better at other restaurants. \\n2. The types of people that were present at this restaurant are the stereotypical arrogant, obnoxious, and \\"never lifted a finger\\" type of people. \\n3. I found interestingly a lot of older white men with younger (20s) girls on dates, which kinda ruined my experience cause it was just awkward \\n4. It's a restaurant for people who just want to throw money away for no good reason. It has a very pretentious atmosphere. And no, I have been to other Buckhead restaurants, and they do not give this type of vibe.

It was memorable then, and I thought I would replicate my experience today.\\n\\nNot so good today. The soup was spiced out of its own gourd. I'm not saying that it was too hot for my flower-like taste buds, just that the heavy-handed spicing of the soup took away any balance of flavors you would have achieved just from cooking. And my serving of soup seemed to have been sitting around for a bit, imho -- it was heavy on the bottom-feeding ingredients (your peppers chunks and other things that sink) and light on the ingredients that you want to actually feature in a soup.\\n\\nMore than that, though, was a sharp decrease in the service. I remember last time the owner/manager (?) walked through and checked on our satisfaction. When a guest I was with expressed surprise that his soup didn't come with a roll (it didn't), the manager/owner just went and got one for him, no questions asked.\\n\\nToday -- no one checked on me. (Again, could be The Curse of Dining Alone striking again.) In fact, one server brought plates to the table immediately adjacent to me, came back and said, \\"And, more tea for you\\" and left my 90% empty glass of tea sitting in my table looking pathetically empty. Despite my trying to catch a server's eye for several minutes (one was too busy reconciling out his tips from the register), no one came to my assist and I continued to plow my way through the over-priced and over-spiced soup sans beverage.\\n\\nQuite a disappointment. \\n\\nI will tentatively agree with the other reviews that comment on the dinner menu being different than the lunch.

My girlfriend had to go walk over to the kitchen and ask the cook for ketchup because the waiter never came back.\\n\\nWe never had our drinks refilled, and we had to grab salt and pepper shakers, cutlery, and napkins from a nearby table because we didn't have any.

We were sitting in front of what looked like a bachelorette party and they had three and four different guys taking their drink orders the whole time and getting them things. These guys had to walk past our table every time to get to this gaggle of girls. So I thought we could order another beer from them. Can I just say confusing? So, because you order everything up front....if you want another beer, you get another check. I literally paid three different times for things because of their system. It's really confusing and I'm still not sure we did everything right. I saw some employees filling up drink glasses...and then there were other tables where we had to get up to get our own refills. Does anyone know what the system is?? Maybe it would help to have signage if you're not going to explain what's going on...\\n\\nService: Like I said, it was confusing....but when you have so many employees running around, I don't feel like anyone should have to get up to get their own refill or a bottle of ketchup.

To drink, I had a Orange Frostie ($2.25).\\n\\nThe sides were fantastic except for the potato salad that was a little too sour for my taste.  They also had creamed corn, cole slaw and peach cobbler:  5 Stars.  On the other hand, the meat was unworldly.  The brisket was super tender and expertly seasoned.  Additionally, the sausage was moist and had a nice snap to it.  Bludso's in CPT and Smoking Ribs in GG (widely considered two of the best in Southern CA), don't compare to this place in ATX.  The owner's family was one the originals from Lockhart where BBQ is king:  5+++++ Stars.\\n\\nRegarding the ambiance, its cafeteria style w/ picnic tables.  In addition, you can see them carve your meat.  At the end of the line are pickles and as much white bread as you want:  5 Stars.  Likewise, the service is super friendly and helpful.  The staff wants you to move along quickly, as well as wants you to feel at home:  5 Stars.\\n\\nI haven't been to well known Franklin's in DT ATX or Salt Lick in Driftwood yet, but Terry's is excellent as far as I am concerned.  Its far better vs what we have access to in Southern CA."},{"name":"Wilfs Restaurant & Bar","address":"800 NW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Worst service ever\\n\\nWent in last week with my husband and 9 yr old daughter on my birthday for savory bread pudding as I have done for years.  We have pretty high expectations of Wilf's because we have always had great food and service here.   But this time we waited for several minutes and finally a server appeared and asked us snidely and quite rudely \\"Can I help you?\\"  When told that we were hoping to sit and eat food she sighed and led us into the dining area.  We asked if we could sit by the window and we were informed that those tables were saved for dinner patrons (it was 3 pm and there was only one other customer in the whole place).  OK.  We ordered drinks and I also asked for 3 glasses of water which she did not bring.  I asked again for water later and only received one glass.  Although the savory bread pudding was on the menu, it was not available.  My husband's kale salad was totally forgotten.  The worst part was the feeling that we were not welcome there.  Perhaps this rude middle aged brunette who served us thought that a family with a kid is not worth bothering with but I waited tables for years and am a great tipper.  It is too bad because I have always loved Wilf's and now I have a savory bread pudding shaped hole in my heart."},{"name":"USTA National Campus","address":"10000 Usta Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First class facility.

You know what I mean - a menu exploding with options, all plates come served with multiple side dishes, towers of jelly packets line the tables, and chances are you'll be called \\"hon,\\" by your server. The Breakfast Club offers all of these things and then a little more.\\n\\nWe arrived at the Breakfast Club at about 8:30am on a Sunday morning. Even at that early hour, a small line was forming at the door. As there were only two of us, we bypassed the line and found a couple of seats at the counter. This was a great choice, as we were able to watch the operation in action.\\n\\nFor breakfast, I ordered The Janitor, a dish served with two eggs, homefries, toast, and homemade corned beef hash. When I was given the option as to whether I wanted the homemade or canned hash, I actually had to pause because there are few things in this world I love more than hash out of a can. I was very happy with my decision. The corned beef wasn't cubed, but pulled, creating a much heartier texture than the often mushy canned version. The Breakfast Club's version was also considerably less salty than what you buy at the store and was served with a great crust after being left on a flat-top grill for just long enough. My friend also got the hash, but had his in the form of the BF's take on eggs benedict. The only point of criticism I can offer is with regards to the homefries. It was clear to me that they were not made to order, rather they had been sitting at a warming station after being cooked in bulk. I find that the potato loses it's integrity the longer it sits, so that may be something for the diner to consider.\\n\\nThe staff at the Breakfast Club are super friendly and responsive. Being from out of town, our server was patient, yet excited, to share her menu favorites with us.

The meat and the tortilla were inedible. I asked the bartender for the check three times and she looked at me and said okay, then continued to clean the bar as if she didn't hear me at all. She never refilled our drinks or asked if the food was okay. The host was literally the only helpful person. She was multi tasking and saw that we looked upset. She immediately stopped what she was doing, apologized and offered to take the bad food off or have it remade. Then she gave us our checks. The host stepping in is the ONLY reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars. the bartender with the attitude needs to learn some better customer service or do something else.

We would have been fine with just the veggie plate.  \\n\\nOne of my favorite Ethiopian dishes is the red lentils (mesir wat), which was well done here, though a little spicier than I'm used to.  I wasn't a huge fan of the vegan tibs, however.  They didn't really taste like they'd been marinated in anything, and just seemed like Gardein beef with the sauce poured on them.

When we arrived, there seemed to be as many customers as there were staff, so it wasn't busy (only one occupied table that I could see on the first floor). We were told to seat ourselves (which we liked), but then our table went unnoticed for about 10 minutes... No one came to greet us at our table, despite several staff members noticing us and speaking with us when we walked in the fairly empty restaurant. We finally waved down a waitress and ordered.

Another waitress was there in less than 2 minutes, so snaps and kudos for her! We all ordered alcoholic drinks of some kinds, and two of them were margaritas. Except the margs were BLUE?! That was odd, because I've seen one of their margs before... And the blue \\"margaritas\\" weren't very strong... we probably should have said something, but we didn't. \\n\\nThe food is honestly okay - there's nothing wrong and/or bad with what I've eaten here, but service definitely needs work.

The veal schnitzel was great, and though I will always think sauerkraut is disgusting, I enjoyed all of the other sides I picked - potato pancakes and hot kraut und ground pork.

Although, if people want to go and watch the game (pick your sport).. I would definitely suggest this place. As far as a restaurant.. mehhh.. no.

I should have tried the raspberry, but the beer list didn't make it to our table until AFTER we had paid our bill and were about to leave. Meh.. I shouldn't be drinking anyhow.

Secondly, the service here was only mediocre.

The breading on the empanada was thick, but I really liked the coolness of the cilantro-lime mayo with the juicy brisket. \\n\\nThe sweet potato tots were really flavorful, seasoned with some sort of spice mix that had a smoky taste to it. My burger was the biggest disappointment. The chorizo burger, advertised, is supposed to come with hash browns, a fried egg, manchego cheese, and an almond romesco. It sounded like a repurposed breakfast burrito to me... aka FABULOUS. However, what I got was an overpowering sausage patty with a fried egg on top. I don't know if it was execution, or what, but the chorizo was really overpowering for me.  The hashbrowns were kind of hidden and I could barely taste them, the same goes for the almond romesco. Another other issue I had was that this burger was a one-trick pony. There was really only one flavor, the chorizo, and one texture. I really would have liked some crisp lettuce, or tomato to cool down the flavors. The burger became kind of heavy, and I quickly got tired of it.\\n\\nI will have to commend the place on plating though.

Nestled into the quaint German Village area of Columbus, Schmidt's draws you in with friendly decorations, flags, and upbeat German music. \\n\\nWhen you enter, you walk past a display counter filled with home made sausage for sale by the pound, then another display counter filled with mouth watering desserts, and finally past a live traditional German band filling the restaurant with bounce-worthy polka style music.\\n\\nWe chose to get the buffet. We tried-\\n\\nGarlic Knockwurst- Crisp bite and wonderful garlic flavor.\\n\\nBahama Mama Sausage- Caribbean style spices that leave you craving more.\\n\\nMild Bahama Mama Sausage- A milder version of the above- our least favorite as it was the least flavorful.\\n\\nTraditional Brats- a fantastic beer brat flavor- my personal favorite.\\n\\nSausage Stew- A surprising gem of a dish! Large chunks of sausage, macaroni noodles, and mixed into a sweet and spicy, Caribbean style sauce that is bursting with flavor.\\n\\nPork Loin- Good flavor, but a little dry.\\n\\nSmashed Potatoes and White Gravy- Creamy and wonderful, and the gravy goes well with all of the different sausages.\\n\\nGerman Potato Salad- Warm and satisfying with the perfect combination of salty and subtly sweet.\\n\\nSauerkraut- The perfect accompaniment to the sausage.\\n\\nGreen Beans and Spatzels- Tasty, however it would be nice to have the spatzels without the beans, so we could put the gravy right on them.\\n\\nPistachio Pudding- Reminiscent of my grandmothers recipe. Old world, sweet, and addictive. Great way to end a heavy meal. \\n\\nCream Puffs- THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD! I tried the traditional vanilla filled with chocolate syrup on top. My brother tried the peanut butter filling with the chocolate fudge and chopped nuts on top. They are huge, half pound each!

Still, I had been telling everyone about how it was opening in MY neighborhood - the west side was finally moving up in the world!\\n\\nKatie W and I agreed to meet up late on a Saturday afternoon, hoping that the rush would be over, but we should have known that such a trendy place will have a wait for the next year.  We got a good look at the interior while waiting - the white was refreshing, and I was impressed by the framed tv's behind the bar, though I was a little taken aback by some of the details of the mural on the back, particularly the foot, since I don't consider feet particularly appetizing.\\n\\nWe did end up with a nice white leather padded booth after our 30 minute wait.  The hostess explained that the kitchen was running behind so the food would take a while, but that she wanted to seat us rather than making us stand at the front.  Then our waiter, Neil, came up and explained the same thing.  There's such a thing as too much warning.  \\n\\nHe recommended that we start with drinks, and I opted for the Pistachio, since I don't have the biggest sweet tooth.  They came somewhat quickly, and they were still covered with liquid nitrogen on the top.  We stirred and pumped our straws to encourage the sublimation and keep the milkshake from freezing completely.  It looked kind of like the freeze-dried ice cream that they sell at the Space and Rocket Center.  I wish it had tasted something like that... it tasted very strongly of chemicals.  I honestly thought some had gotten on the straw and frozen and cracked it such that it mixed in because it tasted like burnt plastic - like the chips that my brother brought home when he worked at the bathtub factory.  Very disappointed.  Katie's Krispy Kreme shake was much better, though I don't think I could have handled a whole shake worth.  When I informed our server that it tasted chemically, he did not seem to care at all, and pretty much implied that I was the freak for thinking so.\\n\\nWhatever, here come the sides - super speedy!  So much for the slow kitchen!  Those onion rings were good, but could have been great with some salt.  Those fries were crispy, but some salt would have really helped.  The rutabaga sticks had too much breading, and when it fell off, it tasted like they could be really good with some salt.  Sadly the sweet potato tot tasted like grease and left a puddle on my plate.  Even in that case I prefer salted grease.  The saving grace of our \\"side\\" plate: smoky mayo.  I don't even like mayo, but I think this could make everything taste better, or at least make you want salt a little less.\\n\\nOur group split 7 burgers: Southern, Corned Beef, Cod, Turkey, Shrimp PoBoyger, Falafel, and Breakfast.  Good, not great.  My favs were the Shrimp PoBoyger, particularly the fried lemon slice, and the first bite of the Falafel.  The others were just ok.  They all kind of tasted the same (at least the non-fish ones).  The toppings were not noticeable.  I love pimiento cheese, but couldn't even taste it on my Southern.  And I was really looking forward to the maple foam on the breakfast, but all I tasted was the sausage.\\n\\nI think Flip might be really good when all the hype dies down, the wait staff tones down their hair and attitudes, and the wait decreases.  Also, couldn't hurt if the economy picks up and it doesn't seem crazy to spend $30 on lunch.  Until then, I'll stick to making my own burgers, maybe even using some of those ideas for my own.

Initially we were headed towards somewhere else but we ended up at Terry's by sheer last resort. But it was actually pleasantly delightful. It's cafeteria style so you serve yourself all the sides that you want. We went a little crazy with the sides since we were starving. We got a scoops of mac and cheese, potato salad, coleslaw, baked beans, and creamed corn. After you get your sides, you go to the front where you get to choose what meats you want and the exact amount since they weigh it right in front of you.

White bread, pickles and onions are also available for you free of charge. \\n\\nThere were a lot of great things about the bbq at Terry's and there were some misses as well. For the meats, the ribs were by far the best. They were soft, and fall off the bone delicious. A bit fatty but very good. My favorite things to eat at a bbq are brisket and sausages. They were just okay here at Terry's. The brisket here was very dry even when I drowned it in their bbq sauce. I couldn't eat too much of it. I enjoyed their original sausage quite a bit but I did not like their jalapeno cheddar sausage too much. I left pretty much all of it on the plate. The turkey that was given to us for free was actually delicious. I would be very happy to have some of that on Thanksgiving. For the sides, the mac and cheese was delicious. Nothing fancy about it. Just solid stuff. I also thought that the coleslaw was fantastic and the creamed corn while a little sweet was also quite good. The potato salad on the other hand was just okay. It was too salty for me. The same thing with the baked beans. Salty to the point of being inedible.\\n\\nFor the most part, we enjoyed our dinner here.

They use locally-sourced ingredients. They have an acre of land nearby where they grow a lot of their own produce. In 2017, There won Atlanta Magazine's 3rd Annual Best Burger Battle at Lenox Square, determined by popular vote. Craft cocktails are a specialty.\\n\\nThere has a simple space: an L-shaped bar, a few TVs for sports, booths, and versatile tables. Outside, they have a small, dog-friendly, covered patio. The atmosphere is casual and at night, is dimly lit. This place felt like a neighborhood watering hole. They're open late daily and also serve weekend brunch. You can catch live music certain times of the week. I felt comfortable here and enjoyed the ambiance.\\n\\nThe pop-up menu consisted of two drinks and three food items:\\n\\nDrinks\\n* Anh Oi ($10) - Vietnamese margarita using fermented lemons and tequila\\n* Minhzy Julep ($10) - Batavia Arrack (Indonesian rice and sugarcane molasses) with ginger, lemongrass, Thai basil, simple syrup, and club soda\\n\\nFood\\n* Veg Papaya Salad ($9) - mix of papaya, sliced napa cabbage, onion, and sprouts topped with cilantro, crushed peanuts, and vegetarian fish sauce\\n* Thit Kho ($10) - four-hour-plus palm-sugar-simmered pork butt and eggs with fresh garlic, caramelized onions, and rendered fish sauce\\n* Momma's Pho ($12) - 50 pounds of beef marrow bones simmered for more than a day, infused with fire-roasted ginger, sweet onions, and lemongrass; rice noodles, cilantro, and scallions, topped with slices of New York strip\\n\\nThe menu, which I uploaded to this listing, sounded a lot more colorful and funny with Jon's entertaining writing style. There owner Bill and chef Shane were at the event helping Jon both in the kitchen and out on the dining room floor. Jon and Bill came out and served some dishes themselves.\\n\\nI tried everything, but the Anh Oi. The Minhzy Julep could've been better. A couple others independently agreed. The alcohol tasted cheap. It's okay, though, because this was a fundraiser and we were there to support Jon.\\n\\nThe food was a different story. Everything tasted great. All of the dishes were Southern Vietnamese dishes. My favorite dish of the night was actually not the pho, but the rice (Thit Kho). It was really good. The pork had amazing flavor and texture. Savory and rich. I'm pretty sure it was the best Thit Kho I've had anywhere. I was really impressed with it considering Jon isn't a professional chef. The dish could definitely hold its own against any Vietnamese restaurant. The ingredients were fresh and I really liked the addition of the crunchy, raw watercress. Also, not only did the dish taste great, but it looked great too. In general, Jon did a wonderful job with the presentation of all of his dishes.\\n\\nAs for the pho, wow. The best part was the meat. My fiancee commented it was the best meat she's ever had in pho and I agree. The meat was high quality, tender, and served rare (it eventually cooked in the hot soup). The beef was super tender and succulent with little fat and virtually no gristle. The broth was clean, clear, and on the light side. Several folks commented on the lightness of the broth. Like the other dishes, all of the ingredients were fresh. I appreciated the attention to detail including stalks of spring onion in the soup and the side plate of veggies including basil, culantro, green *and* red jalapenos, and lime wedges. Jon personally served the side plates. I could tell he put a lot of thought and effort into the execution of each and every dish, both from a taste perspective and a presentation perspective. My friend Melissa said she hasn't had better pho.\\n\\nThe Veg Papaya Salad was excellent. I couldn't stop eating it. I've eaten a lot of papaya salad, both here and in Southeast Asia, and I was a big fan of this particular version. It tasted light and fresh. Some papaya salads are just drenched in fish sauce and become salty. Not this one. Also, the consistency of the papaya and cabbage was just right (often, some can be too hard). The shrimp chips were a nice addition, providing an appetizing, contrasting texture.\\n\\nOverall, I loved how spicy the dishes could be too if you ate the Thai chili peppers and jalapenos. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.\\n\\nMackenzie B was our server. She was sweet and did a nice job.\\n\\nThank you, Jon, Bill, and Shane."},{"name":"Virgils Gullah Kitchen & Bar","address":"3721 Main St","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Rarely do I find myself in Historic College Park, but that's likely to change thanks to this gem of a location!\\n\\nNestled in a row of restaurants you're not likely to miss this location.

She embarrassed in front of everyone in the restaurant and she wasn't even willing to listen to what we had to say. I have never in my life dealt with just a disrespectful manager who wouldn't take into a consideration what the customer has to say. We even asked the manager to pull the camera out if she thought we were lying and she said she didn't have access to that.

Lots of various types of seating and an open view into the kitchen. \\n\\nWe chose to sit at the bar and the service was stellar. The menu is a fresh spin on TexMex, BBQ with a twist of Portlandia. Since dinners are large and on the pricey side, we opted to share. Started with an absolutely delicious blue cheese salad, definitely enough for two. The salad had strawberries, candied pecans and large chunks of blue cheese in every bite. It was stellar. \\n\\nFor dinner we went with the smoked pork belly which was smoked, had lots of crispy delicious parts and a wonderful flavor. It was served with green leaf lettuce to create wraps adding sweet and pickled papaya and pickles. It was an interesting presentation, but not a dish I was impressed with enough to order again. The corn bread that accompanied the pork belly and was absolutely delicious - buttery with the perfect crisp top and fluffy inside.\\n\\nAfter seeing all the gorgeous pics of the Baked Alaska, I had to give it a try! Rather than ice cream, the inside was a raspberry sorbet. The outside merengue was perfectly baked with the toasted edges one would expect. I loved the merengue, and while I prefer sorbet over ice cream, I didn't care for this combo. Just way to sugary sweet for me. \\n\\nDinners was good.

Quite flavorless and the actual chicken tasted like grilled chicken. Exact same with the tikka masala both flavorless. Now with the garlic naan I could not even taste the garlic and the naan was too doughy to be considered naan. The mango lassi was way to thick and not cold enough. Tasted like a warm thick mango milkshake rather than a cold refreshing desi delicacy. Some positives were the gulab jamin although overpriced they were authentic and tasted like real gulab jamin. Also the environment was very nice. We sat downstairs in a cave like setting it was soothing. Quality desi music playing with nice decorations.

But either way -- disappointing! The place is so small that it takes barely 5 minutes to walk all the way around. The centrepiece Christmas tree is not decorated, period. (Well ok, it has nice lights if you walk inside, but still -- from the outside it just looks like nobody bothered to put any effort). \\n\\nThe hurricane potato was decent, but at a good cost too ($7). Chimney cake was also decent at $7.50, but nothing compared to the one I had in Poland (for about 1/5 the price). Do NOT try the Spanish paella -- it was the worst $14 I've spent on anything by choice -- the sauce looked great in the big pan, but in my plate were literally 2 pieces of chicken and 2 mussels... and the rest was all rice. (And to add ham would have made the thing $20...!). \\n\\nSome of the non-food vendors were interesting (like the \\"all-things-chocolate\\" place), but all of them were uniformly way-overpriced.\\n\\nAnd apart from that, there was nothing else! No performances, no music, no nothing. Admittedly, we came around 1pm on a weekday, so the place probably wasn't fully decked out like it would be at night.

It's been a mainstay on the Buckhead restaurant scene since 2001, but I often overlooked Kyma. Not anymore! \\n\\nAside from the food, one of the things I love about this place is the decor and ambiance. Although it's slightly dated by today's standards, it's designed to be reminiscent of what else, Greece. Crisp white and deep blue hues impart a classy, sexy and tranquil vibe. Be sure to look up as you enter to see the starry ceiling. And you can't miss the focal point of the entryway - a fresh fish display. \\n\\nI prefer the bar dining area over the main dining room - it has more charm. There are a few cute, intimate candlelit tables perfect for two. Larger tables are also available in this area, as well as patio seating. \\n\\nOur Greek server expertly guided us through the menu. We started with the octopus ($12.50), hailed as \\"the reason Atlanta eats octopus.\\" I was reluctant to order this because I remember it being very tough & chewy elsewhere, but with such a lofty claim, I figured I had to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did! The tangy sauce & pickled red onions are what made the difference to me - the flavors popped! It was a little chewy, but octopus doesn't really lend itself to being tenderized. The texture didn't stop us from fighting over the last bite! \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the halibut ($30) with leeks and a mussel garlic emulsion. The dish arrived beautifully presented with two perfectly cooked filets perched atop the leek ragout. The flavor was very mild and fresh. It didn't have much seasoning but I added some lemon juice to jazz it up. I enjoyed it, but I probably would've liked it better without the mussel emulsion. Just a personal preference. \\n\\nMy guest has the sargos (striped sea bream), which came with the whole head & fin still intact. It didn't faze him, but I'm just not a fan of feeling like I'm doing an autopsy on my dinner! And for those who don't like food that stares back, you can order it with the head removed.

I also picked up their cole slaw, mac and cheese, and their beans on the way to their meat station. The sides were super delicious and went well with the meat. Nothing was too heavy which I enjoyed. The cole slaw was SUPER refreshing and was perfect for the meat. The beans were cooked pretty well and had really good flavor. I liked their mac and cheese because it wasn't too heavy and it had a nice texture and tasted really good as well. I thought the brisket was cooked PERFECTLY and had a lot of really good seasoning and smokiness to it, even if I requested a leaner part of the brisket. The link was really good too. It may not look like a lot of food at first, but I was STUFFED with my small portions of meats and sides. \\n\\nAnother cool thing about Terry's was that you can ask the workers to see the area where they make their meats and their smokers.

Feeling homesick, yet hungry, I wanted to see if there was a place that brought the two together; a perfect harmony of verbal abuse and stimulated taste buds. Thats how I found Santarpio's. To my dismay I realized that it shares only the first characteristic. The pizza here is marginally unrewarding. And that is my most conservative description. Yes, in my experience for every additional dollar I spent trying to like it after my first time, I was disappointed twice. I was confused, but willing to come back. If not for the food, then definitely for the nasty ungrateful treatment after I've eaten elsewhere.\\n \\n                  The Pizza - is clearly made for toothless people, and has about a gallon of low quality PASTENE sauce that results in what can be described as a strange gooey cheesy soup on a large, moist piece of flat bread.\\n    \\n                  The BBQ- (Lamb) -Consistently half raw beef charred on the outside to give it the impression of being cooked.

I feel like their snack/dessert/drink menu has a wide range of variety, so each person will be able to get what they want! Also, they have items that typical BBT shops don't usually offer, like caramel pudding and crepes. My favourite thing to get is the 'sweet soups' - you can get them hot or cold. I like mine hot. It comes in a mug with a spoon and you can customize it by adding your favourite items, like bubble tea but much more variety! My favourites to add include taro chunks, tofu pudding, kidney beans, and taro and sweet potato balls - a very Taiwanese dessert! (I actually don't know anywhere else where they serve 'sweet soup' so if you do, please leave me a message!)\\n\\nThe only downside about Leisure Tea is that if you want a full on meal, they don't really have that.

And we ordered filet sliders (2 of them per order.) Of course they were amazing because...well, you know, best steakhouse ever! We also shared a crab cake, which fell apart when pierced with a fork.

Not that I would actually order a side for myself (I find all green vegetables to be less than appealing), but at least I can say that if prepared right, they aren't actually mushy - like canned spinach.

The male got a bourbon flight. I got a mint julep, one friend got the whiskey smash and our pregnant friend got a rhubarb strawberry lemonade. We each sampled the others and agreed we liked them all. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was quiet. Before we left it was packed full of families having dinner. Who knew?? I thought it was just a bar. I was also shocked by the size of the interior. From the outside it looked like most of the building was Casa Del Matador and that SWK was half it's size. Upon walking in, the place is a full sized bar and full sized restaurant. Just goes to show, looks can be very deceiving.\\n\\nLastly, the decor is very southern. I'm really digging the old, rustic wood I've been seeing adhered to walls lately. Back-lighting the bar makes the booze bottles glisten like gold. I'm not sure if panning for gold in the wild west was the look they were going for, but it's what came to mind - and I really liked it! \\n\\nFunny thing, there were so many scrumptious items on the happy hour menu, we forgot to order ribs.

I constantly checked our place in line on the app and an hour later when we were second in line, I got a notification that we had been removed from the list. At this point I was hot literally and figuratively (because the only place to wait is outside) and the hostess told me it was because I didn't check in. I work in the service industry and I'm just not a fan of blaming the guest. Especially when I had actually checked in. She did end up seating us right after that but it put a bad taste in my mouth.

I placed an online order and had a quote of 22 minutes arrived thirty minutes later. I wasn't acknowledged for several minutes then finally a man with glasses came and I could tell he was totally overwhelmed. He asked me for the name of my order and was frantically looking for it, several other people came in at that time and he was asking for their names but he hadn't even found mine yet, he dropped me and started dealing with another woman whose order he couldn't find. Finally he got a receipt for me and I paid and when he gave me the check he couldn't find a pen so again he went into panic mode looking everywhere for a pen only to find a crayon. Then I asked him where my card was and he said he gave it to me I said no it's not in the checkbook and again panic mode lifting everything in sight trying to find my card, finally he found it on the floor. He said the food would be another ten minutes. I came in about ten minutes and now more people were waiting, another man's order was misplaced and he re-rang it into the computer. Another woman's was gone as well. You can tell everyone was so mad and tense. All this time we're standing right by the kitchen I see orders piling up I almost wanted to go grab my own food because I knew it was ready. I couldn't get this guys attention until another ten minutes while he dealt with other guests. Finally he sees me grabs my food from the counter two feet away from me which had been sitting there forever hands it to me and I leave. No thank you. No thanks for your patience. No apologies. I'm not even mad I feel bad how unorganized this place is and I feel sorry for this helpless guy who clearly hasn't been trained and had no clue what he was doing. He was not in uniform so I'm  terrified he may actually have been a manager.

The flavors were balanced nicely, and after having one I was still hyped about the donut but not wanting to eat another one because I was full.\\n\\nThere was a long line out the door and around the front but it moved quickly. A worker brought a donut and water out to the homeless man in the front who was very thankful and appreciative and I respected the individual for doing this.\\n\\nThere wasn't much space to sit and enjoy the donut because the space small and the line took up much of it. the walls were white and the atmosphere very hipster modern. It was clean.\\n\\nI prefer Blue Star over krispy kreme and voodoo. Blue Star is a fancy classy donut place about experimenting with different flavors, whereas voodoo is more of a \\"look what we can put on/in a donut!\\"\\n\\nSo why only 3 stars?

I usually prefer shio to miso but at Ryoma, I think Miso is the clear winner. It was creamy and rich with umami goodness. It was spicy, but not too much. Want more heat? They have a Killer Spicy ramen. But what was really amazing was the chashu. Wow, I have to rate this as the best chashu pork I've had in Portland. Thick tender slices, not overly fatty, and a good roast pork flavor. Delicious. In fact, I couldn't eat all the pork in my ramen, there was so much of it. Noodles were chewy, not mushy, and were on the thick side.\\n\\nPrices are in line with other places. Average $9.50/bowl.

What goes better with a burger than fries and a brew? The shakes are also quite good. I'm not a shaker addict by any means, but I'd suggest the Nutrella & Chocolate Covered Pretzel.\\n\\nBurgers are fully customizable, though they start with some preset options. The entire menu sounded delicious, but I had my eye on the Terlingua, topped with Chile Con Carne, Fritos, Cheddar, and \\"Sassy Sauce\\" (a horseradish-mustard-mayo blend). I did that, plus three extras ($1 each): caramelized onions, avocado, and a fried egg. It was a monstrous, delicious beast of a burger.\\n\\nThe Magic Shroom (Yelp's most popular) was meh. I surprisingly dug the Primetime flavor, even though I don't normally care for brie. A must-get are the chili cheese fries. It's more like fries with queso, and it heavily reminded me of a better tasting Chili's skillet queso.\\n\\nOK, here's where you'll hate me. In spite of all the fantastic tastes, I had to do it. I opened up my burger, and took a bite of meat, and only meat. No delicious sauces, no awesome accoutrements, no swig of beer after. Just meat. It's, well, tasteless and textureless. There's no salty, peppery, secret spicy flavor that explodes in your mouth and lights up your tongue. It's not a skinny patty (Smashburger style), nor is it exceptionally thick (Five Guys style). It's not fully defined ground chuck, nor is it a juicy pink, medium rare drip-worthy. In fact, I'm not sure what it is or how to define it. It's just...the middle of the burger.\\n\\nWhat I can tell you is that I took a bite of the fiance's turkey burger (she got the Primetime, with turkey), and the turkey tasted absolutely delicious. I could eat that sucker salisbury steak-style, sans sauce. The beef? No way.\\n\\nIn my mind, I kept comparing it to Burger Guys in Houston, a similarly constructed outfit that does gourmet burgers with premium meat. It's a huge difference: the Burger Guys meat is absolutely divine.\\n\\nStill, there's just something about the whole Hopdoddy atmosphere that put me in a good mood. Like I said, I dug it. Maybe my next bite of meat will be vastly different."},{"name":"Les Faux Bourgeois","address":"663 E 15th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Props to the location - I was impressed to see how this busy bistro has taken up shack right smack in the middle of Viet town, Fraser & Kingsway.\\n\\nWalked in without a reservation at 9 pm on a Friday night, we got lucky with a no-show and managed to snag a table (I wouldn't recommend this, call for reservations as it was a tight squeeze for a seat)\\n\\nClassic French bistro menu - don't expect any fancy fusion twists here.

When I travel on business I am a big proponent on going local. No chain restaurants, coffee shops, etc., if it can at all be avoided. This is no more true when it comes to beer. Drink local as much as possible. I like small local breweries. I love discovering new flavorful beer that I cannot get at home. I'd much prefer to hang out all night at a small brewery with 5 beers on tap. But I have to tell you that this hotel bar has an excellent beer list. 45 beers on tap! 15+ IPAs! Over half of them are from MA. Not only that but the bartenders are very helpful and really know their stuff. When I told them what kind of beer I liked I immediately had 3 samples in front of me with a verbal description of each. This place also has 20+ TVs plus a big screen.

It was my first time trying Ethiopian cuisine as well as most of my friends'. The menu is simple and very approachable, listing clearly the entree options to choose from, its customizations, and sides. All the Ethiopian words are translated like kitfo and tibs making it super easy to order from here for the first time. On top of that, the staff is helpful and will answer any questions you have.\\n\\nI ordered the beef tibs with chickpeas and the kitfo raw. The beef tibs were delicious, charred to perfection with a nice savory and smokey flavor. The seasoning was really close to what you might find at a Middle Eastern restaurant.\\n\\nThe kitfo was...interesting. I've always seen videos of people trying the raw ground beef dish and I've been dying to try it since. It actually wasn't all that scary. The texture was very similar to beef tartare or raw tuna and only had a subtle beef flavor. The rest of the flavor came from the oil and seasonings mixed in. I really enjoyed it but I can see how other people could be wary. If you like raw fish and rare meat then you would enjoy this dish. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that the food is pricey compared to other Ethiopian restaurants I eat at. If you're eating dishes individually, it's hard to get a lot of variety without spending a lot of money on additional sides and customizations. I feel like this detracts from the experience of Ethiopian food. You really have to order the large veggie and meat spreads to truly taste Ethiopian cuisine.

Unfortunately they don't take any reservations, and your entire group must be present before being seated. Fair enough! \\n\\nThis location on Richards Street is actually their second location, which opened earlier this summer. Their first location closed so that they could grow into this larger, gorgeous space with high ceilings and plenty of natural light coming in from the large, street-facing windows. The dining room is able to accommodate 65 patrons, while the bar can seat 10 and the coffee bar seats 8. The space is buzzing with conversation and the large open-kitchen is bustling with activity. It's such a energizing environment to be in for brunch and the space smells amazing. \\n\\nTo start off my day I had to try the Milk Chocolate Lavender Hot Chocolate ($4). The massive mug of hot chocolate was frothy and felt quite light, with just the right hint of chocolate and lavender. I was a little hesitant when ordering because some hot chocolates (especially made with milk chocolate) can be overly sweet and very rich, but Cafe Medina does this one well. On my return, I'll be trying out the white chocolate pistachio rosewater hot chocolate! \\n\\nAs we all enjoyed our morning punch of caffeine, it was difficult to choose what we wanted to eat. All the items on the menu were enticing, and upon scanning the dining room, all the other patrons' food looked delicious. My friend picked out the Fricassee ($17) which has two fried eggs over braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, applewood smoked cheddar and seasonal greens. Finished off with some matchstick apples and a side of grilled focaccia, the ribs were tender with bold flavour, making this a very hearty brunch dish. \\n\\nMy boyfriend went with the Paella ($14), featuring a fried egg over an orzo based paella with spicy chorizo, seasonal vegetables, Grana Padano, avocado and charred tomato salsa. I really wish pictures could give off smells, because this dish may not look like much, but it smelled amazing. The paella base had a lovely colour and punches of flavour and heat throughout. The creamy avocado added an extra textural element and the broken yolk bound every ingredient in the dish together. \\n\\nI found it difficult to settle on just one dish, but Les Boulettes ($17) eventually won me over. Spicy Moroccan lamb meatballs are cooked in a roasted red pepper and tomato stew with black olives and raita, served with two poached eggs and a side of grilled focaccia. Holy moly flavour explosion. The lamb meatballs were moist and tender, seasoned well and free of any gamey flavour. The herbs (especially coriander) were fragrant and the acidity from the tomatoes packed a great tangy punch. The eggs were poached perfect with soft whites and an bright orange, runny yolk. You bet I took that focaccia and lapped up all the sauce. \\n\\nNo meal is complete without dessert, and brunch is no exception. Cafe Medina is well known for their Liege-style Waffles ($3.15), so we ordered one with a side of their raspberry caramel, and one with a side of white chocolate pistachio rosewater ($1 per topping). The made to order waffles were warm and fluffy, but missing that crunch and caramelization that liege waffles are known to have. I really enjoyed the strong raspberry flavour in the sauce, but found the white chocolate too strong and covering the delicate tones of pistachio and rosewater. \\n\\nAt Cafe Medina you wait to be seated, and the food is definitely worth waiting for. The Mediterranean inspired menu offers tons of choices that are sure to make your mouth water. The space is inviting, the staff are friendly, and I would definitely return again on a future trip.

The cranberry sauce was missing the sweetness; it was too tart for the dish, and the bacon was barely there; I completely forgot it came with bacon. Next I ordered the Jamaican Jerk wings which was a highly disappointing experience. It was an insult to the authentic Jamaican Jerk dishes I have had an to the country and the people. There was no spice to it. It was basically American style teriyaki wings. I had them sent back but somehow I was still charged on my bill for them after expressing a strong dislike for them.

This is definitely my favourite ramen shop in Vancouver (I've tried at least 5 ramen shops while I was here). Their ramen reminds me of the infamous Ichiran Ramen in Japan... even though I've never had Ichiran Ramen but it looks very similar to that... that would be my best description of their ramen \\n\\nService 5/5: the staff is extremely attentive and they would greet me when I walked in and sat down and I was greet when I left the restaurant as well. \\n\\nLine-up: Yes, there is a huge line-up every day at this ramen shop. I've waited 20-40mins on average. I waited for less time when I ate alone because it was easier to accommodate one person seat versus a table for two. \\n\\nLocation: There are two locations. I've only been to this downtown location. It was convenient for me because it's close to the tourist attractions including Canada Place. This location is along Robson Street aka my favourite street in downtown Vancouver because they have so many restaurants. I would walk up and down this street and scout for places to eat.\\n\\nDecor: it looks like a Japanese ramen shop. I love their stools because they double as storage... \\n\\nFood: 5/5 I love their broth. It's very fragrant and you can tell that they make fresh broth. Also they do a good job blanching their pork bones because the broth was very clean and didn't taste gamey. You can customize things such as the firmness of the noodles, amount of hot sauce  because they give you a sheet where you circle your preferences for each item. Also their egg is so soft and runny and it melts in your mouth. I like my noodles extremely firm and I love how they made my noodles extra firm each time \\n\\nPortion: Their portion is really tiny so I would pay for extra noodles. I never feel bloated or 100% full even after adding extra noodles and drinking all the broth. If you eat more than the average person, you might want to get a snack afterwards. \\n\\nRecommend? Yes! Looking back on my visit in Vancouver, this is my favourite ramen shop in Vancouver. I would know because I had ramen 5 days straight when I was in Vancouver and I've visited Ramen Danbo 3 times!!"},{"name":"Gem√ºt Biergarten","address":"734 Oak St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Visited this place for a work happy hour and was impressed.

Once the top of the claypot lid is opened, you're greeted with a sensuous steam of pleasant smells. As you enjoy your dish, dig a little deeper to find caramelized rice that clings to the sides of the claypot not wanting it's deliciousness to be eaten.\\n\\nMy favourite is #1 - Preserved Sausage aka Lap Chong. There's two kinds in the claypot: 1) Preserved Pork: A lighter pink with a more subtle and light taste 2) Preserved Duck: A gamier and richer taste of meat. With these slightly salty and rich meats paired with the delicate chinese choy/veggies and fresh rice - it's a warm mouthful of deliciousness. \\n\\nNote: If you want take-out, put in a deposit (about $2?) and you get to take the claypot home, when you return you can reuse your claypot or give it back to get your deposit back.\\n\\nI don't know about the \\"snacks\\" James has but I do know they make some fabulous claypot rice!"},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Austin gets another source of BBQ short ribs in Black's!

Unfortunately, the flavors just didn't blend well together. \\nMarinated Yellowtail: Lychee, Green apple vinegar, pickled asian pear. The yellowtail had a fishy taste and the lychee didn't really compliment the yellowtail since it's too sweet. I think they were trying make it similar to the yokai berry at Uchi, but failed miserably. \\nNew Zealand king salmon: Passion fruit, south pacific fruit daisy, and crown daisy. The one we had last night had kiwi and kiwi does NOT compliment salmon. \\nSoft shell crab: Kumato, woodear, oyster mushroom, shallot, thai basil. This one was not bad. It had a five spice taste to the soft shell crab which was pretty good. The soft shell crab was perfectly crisp. This was probably the only dish I liked.\\nGalbi Style pork rib: pickled shishito and ribs with a garlic sweet soy glaze. This was WAY too salty. My first impression when I ate this was, WHOA, I need water. We had to scrape off the top seasoning part to make it edible. \\nCrab butter: Kani, Radish sprout, and king crab butter.

It was last minute because we anticipated having dim sum but my friend is a Pescatarian and we didn't know if her options would be super limited. So we opted for Medina Caf√© and walked about half a mile from our hotel just as they were opening on Saturday morning. We missed the first seating by a few tables so we had to wait until people started to leave. We were seated around 10 am. We had plenty of time to peruse the menu at that point. I kind of changed my mind a few times but I decided on ordering a Cappuccino with the Coffee Spike (House infused Pecan Bourbon with Butterscotch liqueur and Cr√®me de Cacao). It was served on the side of my beautiful cappuccino and it was good. She had a latte of some sort but I don't recall what. We happened to be seated during their morning happy hour which runs from 9 - 11 am. Discounts were on cocktails ($8), beer ($5), and mimosas ($6). I do not think the coffee spike qualified. So we ordered a house cocktail (the Sun also Rises) and a Mimosa in addition to our coffees.  \\n\\nWe also ordered a liege waffle ($3.50) each along with the white chocolate pistachio rosewater and milk chocolate lavender toppings ($1 per topping). For whatever reason, the waffles were brought out first with our coffees and other beverages. No matter, we went to town. It was well worth it. Our favorite topping was the white chocolate one hands down. It had almost a condensed milk creaminess to it and the pistachio and rosewater flavors were subtle, not overpowering. For our entrees, we opted for the vegetarian tagine ($18) and the sandwich au porc ($17). The sandwich is a \\"mealshare\\" item which means that a portion of the proceeds goes to charity. My sandwich arrived open faced with a beautiful runny & sunny egg, confit pork belly, heirloom sliced tomatoes, Aleppo honey pickles, organic greens, and grilled focaccia. I asked for the mustard on the side because I'm not usually a fan. The sandwich was delicious. I really enjoyed it being deconstructed so I could eat bits of it with a knife and fork. My friend was equally joyous about her vegetarian tagine. Our meal was lovely and the couple next to us spotted a possible celebrity at the bar. I swear; I've seen more random celebrity sightings in Vancouver in 2 days than in LA within the same time period. Service was great as our water never went empty. The server came to check on us multiple times and it was easy to split our check. In the North, I've noticed that they bring the credit card machines to you and it's easy to see who ate what so they can have you pay and sign at the table. This is partly due to most countries having the Chip & PIN option on their credit cards whereas Americans are still doing Chip & signature. They did rush us a little at the end but that's to be expected when there is a line of people outside waiting for a table. They don't have reservations and the line is first come, first served.

We opted for 9:15pm. \\n\\nUpon arriving, the place was pretty busy with nearly almost table full inside and out. There was a private party going on in the lounge side as well. Luckily we had reservations and our host took us to our seats right away. Since we had already studied the menu, we ordered our entire meal when he asked us for drinks. For apps, we got the Escargot and Ahi Tuna. For entrees, we got the Coq Au Vin and Grouper Grand Marnier and for dessert we got the Cr√®me Brulee and the Honeymoon. \\n\\nThey brought out some fresh bread and butter with our cocktails. My husband got an Old Fashioned and I got a Martini. Both were made fine. A few minutes later they brought out my Escargot and the Ahi Tuna. Though the snails were really small, they tasted pretty good. They were nice and garlicky, buttery with lots of herbs. No complaints on my end. My husband's Tuna was just ok, but it didn't taste or look fresh.\\n\\nThen our entrees came out. The Coq Au Vin was delicious and perfectly cooked with the meat falling off the bone. The size of the entr√©e was large too. The mashed potatoes went well with the wine sauce and the vegetables were average. My husband HATED the grouper. He said it tasted horrible and I had to agree. We have NEVER had to send anything back ever in our lives but this was too unbearable. He apologetically asked for the pork tenderloin instead and our server did not bat an eye or make us feel uncomfortable. He apologized to us and quickly brought out the other dish. The pork was definitely better than the fish but my Coq Au Vin was better than the pork. \\n\\nFinally, we were ready for our desserts. The Honeymoon was delicious - nice and light, sweet and creamy, and just the right portion for me. My husband loves Cr√®me Brulee but this one came out too burnt on the top and the inside was very eggy - not custardy and creamy like it should be. \\n\\nSo while my husband and I dined together, we had two VERY different experiences when it came to our food choices.

I have seen most of the same servers each time I have dined, so I don't think there is a lot of turnaround and they are happy to work at Babette's. This is a wonderful restaurant for special occasions, a business dinner, or a small to large party, but make sure you make a reservation no matter the size of your party.\\n\\nI do try to experience new and/or different dishes, but my favorite small plate remains to be the 1/2 pound of mussels in a strawberry and sorano pepper broth. Make sure to sop up any remaining broth with your baguette. Regarding entrees, I have a special place in my heart for the filet with gorgonzola sauce and horseradish mashed potatoes. This was the first steak dish I had that showed me how delectable medium rare meat could and should taste.\\n\\nI recommend all of the desserts, and I think I can honestly say I have tried them all. When it's in season, try the blueberry tart, or the cherry almond tart. Some desserts, such as the chocolate bread pudding with ice cream, are available year round, thankfully.\\n\\nBabette's is a wonderful, special, but not pretentious restaurant that features French, Italian, and Spanish cuisine. You can make a meal by selecting a few small plates, or the entrees are large enough to satisfy my sometimes insatiable stomach. The prix fixe menu offered on some weeknights is a deal and offers some nice variety. Chef Marla and her staff use local, seasonal ingredients so the menu does change with the seasons.\\n\\nBe sure to check the restaurant's website at least once a month because chef Marla has special dinner themes such as Lobster night, Julia Child night, etc. On these occasions, the regular menu is available as well as specials for only that particular night.\\n\\nBabette's has a full bar and friendly, knowledgeable bartenders. They are happy to have you sit at the bar if you have arrived early for your reservation. This is a modern European restaurant, so while you can't enjoy French champagne by the glass, they do have Italian Proseco. They offer reasonably priced yet somewhat strong cocktails, so you could be fine with just one drink.\\n\\nTips: \\n-Always reserve a table either through opentable or by calling the restaurant. While they will try to accommodate you, this is not a good restaurant at which you just drop by.\\n-Sign up on the mailing list for birthday and/or anniversary specials!\\n-Babette's Cafe has complimentary valet service parking only, so make sure to tip your driver.\\n- During warmer weather, they have ample a/c, so you might want to bring a light jacket or sweater if you're seated near the floor vents.\\n- Don't be embarrassed to make crumbs with the baguette. Your server will use the crumb catcher. You will want to have bread to sop up any scrumptious sauce on your plate.\\n-If something isn't to your liking, politely tell your server. They will try to remedy any issue, and  Chef Marla will check with you if there are any other concerns (if she is available).\\n- They have a lovely deck, but they cannot control traffic noise or bees trying to pollinate their flowers, so keep that in mind when choosing where to sit."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food, friendly and quick service.

Terry Black's caught my attention. Thankfully, since I had a trip planned to visit family in Houston for a wedding, I thought it was the perfect time to drive up to Austin and try this place out.\\n\\nThe experience was quite pleasant, even in the line under the Austin, Texas summer sun. The queue wrangled around from the entrance, to the sidewalk, wrapping around to the side of the restaurant where the cooks are flame-roasting the barbecue. I was observing all the different kinds of Austinites, fake trendy millennials in sunglasses to hard-working locals, while I was waiting in line and also for my friend who was visiting Austin to come here and eat with me. My friend arrived about 20 minutes later and he held my place in line for me to go #1 in the bathroom. I waited a total of about 30 minutes (not a bad wait, all things considering).\\n\\nThe line went through pretty quickly inside as well. It was fun waiting in line, weirdly, and we finally arrived to pick up our sides. I got baked beans and cole slaw, and then 1/2 pound brisket and 1/3 pound cheese sausage. Onions and pickles and bread are free, of course. We got the drinks, and the total came up to for ~$54 . And boy, oh boy, my two slices of juicy and fatty brisket tasted amazing without having to add BBQ sauce. So tender cutting the meat with the knife, and adding BBQ sauce to the brisket actually masked the salty taste and moist texture, so I would definitely 86 the idea of adding BBQ sauce for the experience; same for the sausage. I enjoyed the bits of cheese inside the sausage; and as for the level of moistness, it was aiight.\\n\\nI felt that the atmosphere for the place was quite inviting, quite lively. Employees are very friendly, and we found a place to sit pretty quickly. Since this place was very out of the way (I actually live in California now), parking is limited, and lines are long even after lunchtime at 1:00 PM, I still recommend coming to Terry Black's Barbecue.

We spoke briefly my husband said he spoke with her when he  stopped by and she said it was someone else who no longer works there! We said that was quick! Mimosa was really liking my husband Stenson  hat most of what she complimented about! James who was our waiter we asked him to recommend a good Italian wine so we ordered two bottles which cost us $$$$$90.00! When we got home we looked up the wine and this bottle is only$10.45! Talk about Marking up a cheap bottle of wine!  My husband ordered Chicken Marcelo! When he got it it tasted like mushrooms came from a can at H-E-B and the Chicken was very thin almost like frozen Chicken Patties! For $$27.50 it was horrible! We\\nOrdered Seared Scollops and you get two for $$17.50!! They were salted too much! I am Greek and my father was from Athens Greece! It is really hard to compare or find authentic Italian or Greek food that is as good! I ordered Linguini  and clams with white sauce! The price $$ 24.00! I asked for it not to be spicy  it was and James said it was his fault! They fixed and brought it out! It was ok but honestly I told my husband this is not authentic Italian food and I bet the Chef is not an authentic Italian Chef! When my husband asked if they could make chicken piccata they did not know what is was! Could not make it! We asked James about the chef and I was right! I will not go into detail on Chef! Just that he is not Italian or a Chef from an Italian background or went to school, They salt the food too much! Very overpriced! I can not recommend to anyone on having dinner or desserts Frozen not fresh and it was two small chocolate balls filled with frozen custard at a cost of $$$8.00.\\nThe salad was horrible it sounded delicious! It was so bitter you could not enjoy any flavors! The worst I have ever had! At a cost of $$12.50! This dinner with tax was over $200.00 plus tip!!!

We asked James  to sit down and we spoke to him about this adventure dining at the restaurant!

It's tows the line past a fast food burger into a more fast-casual burger with some even further elevated options. There's almost always a line, and they know that and you should too. They have done a lot to optimize the line experience and make it run as smooth as it can while maintaining high quality standards and prepared to order food. \\n\\nWhen the line gets long enough they'll have a runner with a tablet walking the line giving out table numbers and taking your order ahead of time. This lets the kitchen get started, you feel relaxed with your order in and all the while you're not even to the end of the line yet. When you do get there you just give a table number and pay, super quick.\\n\\nWant a drink while you wait, that can happen too. \\n\\nWhen you do finally sit down they'll bring stuff out as it's ready. That means salads and fries are first. All the burgers will likely time to come out shortly after that. \\n\\nThere are a lot of great options, but for me, I go off with the Ahi Tuna Burger, because where else can you get a sushi grade raw tuna burger seared for happy umami topped with a crispy bed of nori with pickled ginger and a wasabi spread.

The remaining waitress ignores us and the other diners for an excruciatingly long time - every table in the joint is looking around, utterly annoyed. I planned on having a dessert \\"birthday crepe,\\" but by the time waitress #2 decides to stop by (asking if we're ready for the check - no mention of dessert), I'm ready to bail.

We missed it and went a block further before turning back. So if you're not familiar with this place, know that it's next to the L'Hermitage Hotel (another reviewer noted that, but I didn't note that prior to walking here.

If you're looking for traditional diner/breakfast fare, this probably isn't the place to get it. Granted, you can get eggs and toast and bacon a la carte, but it probably won't be the same mountain of food that you get piled on at a diner (not that there's anything wrong with diner fare! I love diners!). But this place is different. Their foods were all fancied up and plated prettily, too. I think everything is organic as well. My husband and I opted to have breakfast/brunch specialty dishes: hubby had the \\"sandwich peameal\\" which had eggs and \\"peameal bacon\\" with tomato jam and other stuff; I had the salmon fume dish which was unlike any smoked salmon/lox dish I have ever had - but it was delicious. Just ... different. They had thicker chunks of smoked salmon in cream cheese on a thin slice of grilled focaccia bread, with other stuff. Really wonderful.

Just do not know that slapping it next to a Cheesecake Factory at an OTP mall is the best move.\\n\\nThe vibrant space is high irony, not unlike the menu. Basically one long extended pun. But at a very luxo level. So long as you are not seated facing the wall, plenty to engage you.\\n\\nThe concept is let's slam pub grub with sushi/asian fusion, see what happens. Mostly fun, but also an incredibly long menu that is not much of a chore for diners in the know, but IS a tax on wait staff who must explain everything in depth to diners NOT in the know, which at a mall, might be quite a few. Case in point was the table next door, who requested a complete refire of their order once it hit the table. Not good. Combine with odd staffing which gave our poor server tables at the far ends of the space AND outside, no wonder it took forever to get waters refilled, entrees after app etc. Management needs to rethink staffing, ASAP.\\n\\nStill that is not a reflection on the fare, which is quite fresh and full of high-quality components, if combined in odd-ball ways. Ironic then (can you even have irony on top of irony?) to find that the Cowfish Crinkle Cut Fried Pickles ($7) were an archetype of the bar staple, with great batter and not too greasy, and cut THICK just like the best of ATL. Aces.\\n\\nFrom there, a divergence on the entrees. The bento boxes are understandably popular as they are explicitly NOT a fusion, but a funky contrast. Burgers, sushi, fries, edamame each walled off, daring you to break thru. The various bentos ($14-18) are essentially the same, just a function of appetite. One or two sliders, more or less sushi. But the universal take was that the burgers outshone the sushi, which seemed a little gooped up and stiff. \\n\\nThe other Cowfish hack -- sammiches with direct fusion grafts -- was reflected in the the Pittsburgoo-shi Sandwich ($18 Seared rare seasoned filet mignon topped with navel pastrami and french fries, melted Provolone and truffle cheeses, red onions, lettuce, creamy Dijon. Served on grilled spring roll wrapper \\"buns\\" filled with kani and sushi rice. Choice of side) which was every bit as complicated as it sounds. Do suggest a slaw or Thai cuke side to even things out a bit with this monster. Unfortunately my prep was no where near rare (which in truth NEVER happens with line cooks) more like medium well. So much for the Pittsburgh. But the quality cut made for a beefy, tender sammich -- along with all the strange flavors. I really liked the mash up, but could easy see it not being a universal vibe. You know, like with a non-destination mall walking crowd.\\n\\nMeanwhile, nice draft menu, not crazy, but good. However, the killer shakes are kinda another bizarre clash -- if I really want a $6.5 shake to top off, am I gonna spend $14 on a burger? Dunno, just seems like one or the other to me, although high-end burger joints keep insisting to the contrary. \\n\\nBottomline, it was a nice, different lunch at $25 per on a weekend, despite the taxed service, but I honestly do not need to go back again.

After we arrived a short line developed but nothing major. I order the chocolate buttermilk donut which was superb. The donut itself was rich but not overwhelmingly so, nice & soft. The glaze was wonderful: think of the whole donut as a fancy upgraded version of the Krispy Kreme chocolate glazed. My brother ordered a classic sugar donut of some sort & my mother ordered a creme br√ªl√©e donut, both of which they enjoyed. \\n\\nMy brother & I ordered a Mexican chocolate donut to share. We ordered it without thinking about how Mexican chocolate is often kind of spiced. I did not like this donut because the spice overwhelms the flavor and doesn't leave a particularly good feeling in the back of your throat.

I don't know if he updated the menu for the price or the portion size since I don't remember how much it was before but it was definitely a smaller portion that were used to.\\n\\nThe steam muscles are always another favorite of ours. Never overcooked and very tasty! The toasted bread that it comes with is just perfect for dipping to the sauce.\\n\\nFor the main courses we've tried many different dishes. Our favorite go to is usually the lobster pasta, the lobster is always very sweet and succulent and they come out showing you the fresh grilled lobster before taking it back to just take the meat out and making your pasta. The portion of pasta maybe a little bit small so I don't think it would satisfy someone with a larger appetite.\\n\\nThe lamb chops here were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. One of the few places that I'll have lamb chops because I know it'll always be cooked right.\\n\\nI've also had the dinner entr√©e prawns and as delicious as they were however for a main entree it only came with 4 shrimp on tomato sauce. I think it needs another component or some starch to make it more of a meal than comparable to an appetizer. \\n\\nFor dessert, on our first visit we ordered three full-size desserts to share. The donuts we ordered a half order but that was our least favorite dessert. It's just fried dough balls soaked in a syrup that made it very sweet and had honey on top as well. Our two favorite desserts here is the baklava and especially the blueberry dessert in Filo dough that's perfectly light and not too sweet of a dessert. \\n\\nOverall this is a place that usually has solid food once you know what to order.

I recognized it when I first moved here and told the server at the Hairy Lobster to please not bring my first drink ten minutes after the accompanying course again. The disdain.  Same things happened here with a large party I brought back after a great initial experience with the pork chop. We were eating light that night and after an initial best pork chop ever experience, I wanted to try more items, so I brought the entourage.  With appetites sufficiently up for the task I ordered a few of their signature beef bone, the chicken, some pork belly and several other dishes.  Lets start with the beef.(see photo)  As a Texas boy, I do love the concept, tortillas, a big hunk of meat and some tasty fat to make the wine sing. What we received was some admittedly good meat with a 3-1 fat ratio, on the fat side.  For $59, one would hope for a decent amount of beef, after all, this is a sharing kind of place.  Nope, we all got a few bites and then  tossed the fat pieces around. Brought it up to the server who just smiled, presumably she has heard that before.  $29 maybe I wouldn't feel so violated but $59. Tasty wouldn't have done this.  Now the chicken. Looked amazing but set it in front of the teens and they are fighting to get a bite. Having owned a few fine dining restaurants, I've dealt with the uneducated consumer complaining about the pinkness of a smoked or rotisserie item, explained the cooking process to them and after urging them to dig in, have found that them content. Again, I brought it up to the survey who flatly responded, \\"Its been smoked for 24 hours.\\"  Smoke up my orifices blown, but not in sufficient quantity to not make it such a fight to eat, I responded and we went on with our large family meal.  Now I am getting the stares from my damn full grown foodie snob kids who are giving me the look that says, \\"dad you said this was an amazing place\\" and I am regretting educating them on what a well prepared meal taste like.  I review further down suggests going to the bbq pit a whole foods and the truth of the matter is, for a $59 fat bone and a chicken that will fight back with you when you try to eat it, $39 maybe?

It's located in German Village and even just the outside of the building is gorgeous. It is an older building, but you really get to appreciate the craftsmanship. Right now there are Christmas lights around the building and it looks extra cute :)\\n\\nYou walk in and see a display case of their sausages and desserts. Can I just eat the dessert first? Their desserts which are things like German Chocolate Cake, JUMBO cream puffs, and pies, are seriously huge. Definitely come hungry.\\n\\nWe were seated at a two person booth right away. The drink menus are at the tables already and we were handed the food menus. I kid you not everything on the menu sounds delicious. The waitress took our drink orders - Oktoberfest beer and a merlot sangria. We ended up getting a sausage platter sampler to try all 4 of their sausages. We got our drink orders within 5 minutes of ordering - YAY! The Oktoberfest was a lighter beer than expected and I was personally not a big fan of the Sangria. I do not think the flavors put in there mixed well together. There was also a lot of vanilla flavor, which I am guessing is maybe from the merlot? It was off putting so I unfortunately did not drink much of the sangria. \\n\\nOur food came out pretty quick . You get about 1/4 of each sausage on a bed of sauerkraut. It also comes with applesauce, German potato salad, and a bun. It was kind of cool how they ordered the sausages from mildest to the most flavor (unless it was unintentional). I loooooved the brat, but overall all of the sausages had different flavors. One was smokey, one was spicy, and one had similar tastes to a (fancier) hot dog. The potato salad? I could eat a gallon of it. The chunky apple sauce? I could eat a gallon of that too. It had so much natural apple flavors with the hints of cinnamon on top. I also appreciated the toasted bun.  \\n\\nWe then got a jumbo cream puff and a german chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The jumbo cream puff is the size of my head. I actually appreciate that it wasn't too sweet. The shell was very chewy and I am not sure if that is how cream puffs are supposed to be?! I do not eat many cream puffs. The german chocolate cake was delicious and when you mix it with the ice cream you get a taste of heaven! I do wish the cake part was not refrigerated because it takes away some of the moisture.

It's where you find lawyers dressed in robes quickly grabbing a drink and croissant between cases, yoga moms with their big baby strollers, and ladies who lunch.  \\n\\nIt is a bit like a French bistro with it's cute little patio outfront with it's overhang offering some shade from the bright sun.  The inside is all shades of the chocolates... molten brown warm hues are everywhere and then dashed with a bit of golden gleam.  Seating inside is limited. Though it is half the space indoors, there are only maybe 8 small tiny tables inside.  \\n\\nThe offering here on a weekday is not much but they do have a full espresso bar with many packaged sweets.  The actual patisserie place had only 4 items with 2 larger cakes and then they had some vienoisserie in another case.  I would have liked to try some of the pastries but for an early morning walk, I was feeling more of their famed mocha and I've heard of their croissants being quite good.\\n\\nMocha - I love when a chocolatier using their own chocolate to blend in the espresso and milk to make this.  Soma and Soul chocolate are a few small bean to bar chocolatiers in Toronto that do this wonderfully.  I was hoping the same and ... it just missed the mark. The chocolate is a nice tempered bitterness but there was too much milk and water.  Not enough coffee or chocolate to make this more than a watery diluted drink.  A shadow of what it could be. 3.5/5\\n\\nCappuccino - Same results as the mocha but except it has less flavour because of no chocolate.  It's watery and lacking coffee notes of any kind.  I understand this is a pastry focused spot but cappuccino and a slice of cake is a perfect afternoon snack? 3/5\\n\\nAlmond croissant - This fared better than the drinks.  Good clear delicate layers sit on top of each other and filled with a generous smear of marizipan and dusting of almonds.  The croissant itself is buttery but not light... it's baked up perhaps to the point where the delicate buttery layers becomes hardened crust instead of emphereal buttery whispers. 3.5/5\\n\\nI think there are a lot of great potential flavours and the cakes do have a wonderful charm to them but for the drinks and croissant, it just didn't live up to the reviews previously done."},{"name":"Champions","address":"110 Huntington Avenue","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Great place to watch the game.  13 large screen TVs plus one giant one made up of 6x6 32\\" TVs so 196\\" of game.

BBQ & Smoked Meats is not Fried Chicken.  The only good thing The Coop has is their ox tail. Everything else is pretty horrible- I've been here twice & both times the food (other than ox tail which btw runs out fairly quickly) was bad. How can a fried chicken place named \\"The Coop\\" be so bad? \\n\\nWhat's Wrong? \\n1. The disinterested teenage workers. Look, I get it. It's a cafeteria food job. But when you snark at collard greens or slap grits on a plate like a leaky bowel movement with about as much gusto as the cafeteria lunch lady - perhaps you should find a new job. You should probably not have side comments on how bad the food is. You should also not say, \\"Don't bother reading the menu board, all we have left is what you see\\" in a monotone voice. Also, don't snicker at the baby carrots when it's the only thing you have. \\n\\n2. Your chicken is mediocre. If you have the balls to call your resturant \\"The Coop\\" make the chicken so good that my mouth waters just thinking about it. Someone mentions 4Rivers, I'm insta-happy. I want that feeling with The Coop. That way I can justify the price. Don't make subpar expensive chicken. Why would I even go here when Publix or even WinnDixie (ouch) makes it better? \\n\\n3. Shabby chic decor that is clearly store bought.  Some of your tables are beautiful.  Then I notice that all the sets of chairs were evenly divided with each table. Look. I'm a firm believer that if you're going for the distressed shabby chic look - do it with gusto. Don't half a** it by making the tables unique then buying sets of chairs, then evenly dividing the chairs so it's faux distressed. Go all the way. \\n\\n4. What happenned to the 4Rivers sauces at the table? Now there's 4Rivers branded ketchup. \\n\\n5. Your sides are flavorless. The steamed brocolli had the consistency of a damp soggy tampon.

Well, we watched one of your employees dump all the used ice from the trough into the storm drain. All of it. So awesome being green, Coop!

To me waiting 45 minutes for great food is well worth it and I felt sure that they were making a mistake.

The wrap was fantastic! It has a light, delicate flavor with just the right amount of spice.\\n\\nFor my entr√©e I decided on the Goden Tibs. As I placed my order, our waitress commented that I had ordered \\"the best\\". While I might not agree with her on giving the dish the title of \\"best\\", I will say that it was darn good.

No worry! Made-to-order tacos came out FAST and our guests were especially happy that they could take a number and continue to enjoy the reception without having to stand and wait for their food.\\n\\nOur order consisted of 2-3 tacos per person + chips & salsa for 150 people. We were allowed to select 4 tacos options, so we chose steak, migas, fish and veggie which would allow all of our guests an option. Chips and salsa were set out on tables so guests could appetize during the reception.\\n\\nFood trucks can be a bit loud and we had them park pretty close to the action, so the Veracruz ladies rented a quiet generator for us at no extra charge. It was perfect. They showed up on time, worked quickly, and the tacos were just as good as when you order them any other day. There was no reduction in quality as compared to their normal services.\\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, our guests were not hungry or disappointed. Our local guests were happy to eat tacos they know and love, and our out-of-towners got a true Austin culinary experience. No one complained that we \\"only\\" had tacos and chips + salsa - they left with full and happy tummies.\\n\\nI'll also note that our dessert service was Bananarchy. No cake at this wedding.

It's chic, clean, and cozy and therefore, would make a really wonderful date restaurant. \\n\\nI split the Foccacia pizza (Ricotta, mozzarella, feta, sun dried tomato, artichoke hearts, pesto) and it was delicious. I also had a bite of the Margherita pizza (Mozzarella, fresh basil, marinara) which was very average and just all right. Similarly, the Penne Al Pollo and Fideos Con Tomate were just all right. Had I ordered the all right dishes for myself, I would have walked out disappointed. \\n\\nHowever. \\n\\nTheir tiramisu is absolutely, drop-dead, 100% exquisite. It is light and fluffy and sweet (but not overly so) and creamy and just... perfect. It's perfect. My sisters were both given some as a birthday on-the-house treat, and though they generally are not Tiramisu lovers as I am, happened to love it and said that they would come back for the dessert. \\n\\nI'm going to snag myself an unsuspecting boy, convince him to bring me to this place (\\"What?

The mac n cheese was delicious and it's making my mouth water just remembering this lunch. The coleslaw had mixed reviews in our group and all of our were surprised with the broccoli in it. The beans were amazing and I would get more next time. We loved the cornbread muffin. No one in our group liked the peach cobbler, it was just ok. I loved the sausage, it was bursting with good spices and flavor. The beef brisket was tender and delicious, but some in our group didn't love it (they are crazy!). The pork ribs were pretty good, but my least favorite of the meats.\\n\\nThe food was worth the wait!

I'm a big fan of tapas, especially when they're authentic. We gathered up our friends, made a reservation for last Friday night (someone posted that they don't take reservations on Friday or Saturday nights, but they do for parties or 4 or more). We ordered red and white sangria while we waited for the rest of our party of 9 to arrive - both good but the red was better than white. Once everyone arrived, we decided that we were all willing to try anything, and would take our waiter's recommendations. Best. Decision. Ever. We first received a few types of potato salad, octopus and pepper salad and roasted peppers - all on the house. Our meal was off to an excellent start. We then ordered more red sangria and our next round of tapas - Spanish ham, Spanish omelet, manchego and chorizo, manchego and olives, 4 types of croquettes and 3 types of empanadas. All delicious. Next came patatas bravas (spicy but amazing), oxtail (on special; best I've ever had), spicy garlic scallops, garlic shrimp, and of course, more sangria. We decided to be adventurous and tried the quail legs (pretty good) and rabbit in almond sauce (sauce was fantastic - everyone who tried the rabbit liked it) along with some kind of chicken dish, little sausage links and beef tenderloin with blue cheese, and sure, we'll have one more pitcher of sangria. Our meal ended with the most delicious dessert - white chocolate bread pudding (crowd fave, still dreaming about it), pumpkin cheesecake (on special) and chocolate cake. I wish I could remember our waiter's name; all of his suggestions were spot on. The chef came to greet us, and the owner followed us out at the end to make sure we enjoyed our meal & I gave him a hug (my friends were jealous). This was the best tapas experience ever and we're already planning our next trip back."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is the place recommended by several locals if you want a good donut in Portland!

I had a small pile of leftover napkins plates stacked on my table and a table-cleaner kid walked by and asked if I'd like him to take it away. Although nothing truly extraordinary, these little bits of courtesy and dedication seem to be generally lacking from the younger generation of workers.

My party of 4 rolled in at 530 on a Friday, just in time for happy hour.  Originally, we were told we'd have to wait but a blue haired superhero swooped us up and took us to the end of the bar.  It's a small place, with outside seating too - so I can see it would get super packed with a long wait.  I hate waiting.\\n\\nWe perused the menu and had a few delicious cocktails while waiting.  We ordered 5 appetizers and watched the magic going on in the open kitchen.  Fantastic solution for a small space!  I counted at least 3 grills but some walls I could not see behind, with masters at each station.  We requested the snapper ceviche, smoked lamb shoulder, grilled potatoes, shitake pasta and pork belly pate.  \\n\\nOur waters were refilled plentifully as we ran though that, impatiently awaiting the first course.  The snapper ceviche showed up first and though I loved the sauce, I did not care for the fish.  I have to be in the mood for raw and tonight was not the night.  After we tucked that dish away, our empty dish was taken away and replaced with the shitake pasta.  Dear god, the sauce underneath that was so delicious. \\n\\nNext up, came the pork belly.  Now, it was visually unappealing just a shredded mess of meat held together with what looked like mayo.  It came with toast points, sweet & sour mustard, raw onion & arugula.  I felt like it was supposed to be a deconstructed sandwich so I took a toast point, slathered it with mustard, piled high with meat and topped with onion & a piece of arugula.  Both my friend and I demolished that plate, while our two other party people pretended they didn't care for it.  Point is, don't be turned off by something you normally don't like, just try it.\\n\\nThe grilled purple potatoes came out mixed lovingly with chunks of crab meat and in a light, parmesan sauce?  Whatever it was, it turned out to be one of our favorite dishes!  The final dish was the lamb shoulder... perfectly done, medium rare little cubes of innocent lamb.  By this time, I was in a food coma so I may not get all of the ingredients but did determine it was my favorite dish.

I've only ever been during breakfast hours, so my comments revolve around the drinks and breakfast foods.  The lunch menu looks really interesting, hopefully some day I can make it over to the joint for an afternoon bite.\\n\\nWhen you enter, there is a large blackboard stretching up to the ceiling with the list of food and drink items offered.  I've sampled a few of the breakfast sandwiches, though I prefer the Groggy Goat.  There's something about eggs and goat cheese that I can't resist.  Add some sundried tomatoes and now you're cooking with Crisco!!!!  The sandwich then has a ton of spinach stuffed inside before getting warmed up under a panini press.  The end result is a very satisfying and savory sandwich.  Throw in an iced coffee (warm weather days of course) and I am happy.  I like the coffee as it is not super bitter (never got into that).  \\n\\nThere are about 6 or so small tables so that if you want to eat there you can.  They also have free wi-fi and they sell newspapers as well.  The establishment is comfortable without all the fluff that some other cafes can have.  It is a quick jump from the Broadway T stop, and there are a few street parking spots with 2 hour parking during the week, if you are able to snag one."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yes, the burger is good, but is it worth the wait?  Nah.\\n\\nIf you're cruising by Hopdoddy and there's no line outside, it might be worth stopping in.  As it was, I've had far superior burgers.\\n\\nAfter waiting on the sidewalk for a while, we were let in to see the line extended significantly beyond that point.  There was just one cashier who seemed utterly disinterested in chatting me up.  A sign on the register said tips could be used for things like, \\"Bringing Jon Snow back.\\"  I mentioned to him that the tips must have worked since Snow was resurrected on the previous night's episode of \\"Game of Thrones.\\"  He just kinda smirked at me, making me regret tipping him at all.\\n\\nOnce you've paid, you get a number and sit at your table and wait.  The fries came out to us first.  I really liked them, especially with that killer queso.\\n\\nFor my burger, I went with the Llano Poblano (Angus Beef, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Tilamook Pepper Jack, Seared Poblanos, Chipotle Mayo, Red Leaf Lettuce, White Onion, Beefsteak Tomato.)  It was a pretty good burger, but the bun ultimately fell apart under so much grease and way too much mayo.  I hate that.

The first person who came over put down napkins, which I assume is their signal to one another that a table is being helped, as when I made eye contact a few times they looked at the napkins and kept walking.\\n\\n5 more minutes pass before a new server comes over to apologize for the wait and say it's because it's a shift change. If that was the case, they need a better system. We order two beers, two waters, onion rings and two sandwiches. A standard amount of time goes by and the onion rings come out but what happened to our beers? At this point I'm staring at our server again who comes back with our water and says' that there is a problem at the bar but our beers are coming. We saw other people getting beer (both at the bar and at their tables), so what was the problem? Did she forget to put them in? If she did, say it, everyone makes mistakes.\\n\\nWe got our beers when we were half way done with the onion rings. The onion rings needed salt, but the sauce was good. \\n\\nThe Nebo (my sandwich) was HUGE and good but there was too much bread. My friend said the same about his Rialto.

The beef on the other hand, needed a bit of improvement. Even though the meat was lean and flavourful, it was rather tough. I would have preferred it to be softer.\\n\\nI was rather disappointed with the beef wraps. At $8, I expected these to be better than they were. The beef wraps at Joy's Taiwanese Kitchen taste astronomically better and are equivalent in size for half the price.\\n\\nI don't know what brand of Hoisin sauce they used, but the sauce tasted artificial and way too sweet! They also used too much cucumber, so much that I could barely taste the beef. It was evident that they used the cucumber as a filler as the beef slices were too thinly sliced.\\n\\nPresentation wise, the wraps looked as if they had been thrown together and were rather carelessly made.\\n\\nThe taiwanese chicken nuggets were quite good! Granted, they weren't as good as the ones at Pearl Castle, but definitely satisfied my Taiwanese chicken nugget craving!\\n\\nThe exterior was nicely battered and fried, and was seasoned with pepper.

After nearly four years & forty visits, my attention still flits at ninety miles an hour from the food to the plates to the staff to the kitchen and to everyone sitting and surrounding us. It's almost like a surreal moment from Caddyshack - \\"Errol, be the Barley.\\"\\n\\nTwo things different about this particular evening: First, I didn't take any pics - yeah, the menu was all new to me, but they'd still look like the six hundred other photos already posted here. And second, when Chef Charles - the young Asian guy with glasses - asked what I thought about tonight's food, I almost said \\"I was more fascinated with the all-vegetarian plates I watched you make for me the last time I was here.\\" But I'm learning there are times when I should simply STFU, so my response was, \\"Tonight was great.\\" Because it was.\\n\\nI guess I could sidebar with some appropriate Yelp gravitas: Barley is closed Sunday, but have reopened for Monday dinner service. You could show up without a reso, but that's silly - try calling after 3pm and work something out. If you're a couple, trust me and ask to sit at the counter. You're going to drop a $100 a person here for the prix fixe food menu, tax & tip. If you're into beer or wine, splurge and let them do the pairings. They'll also ask if you have any food allergies beforehand. And if you really want to, you can see what'll be on the menu at their website. I think it's more fun to be surprised.\\n\\nAnd what also surprises me is when someone says a restaurant is so good they'd eat there every day. I'm inclined to believe that would get boring pretty fast. Barley Swine is still my favorite restaurant in Austin, because it's a perfect long distance relationship to me - we both look forward to seeing each other after a little time has passed.

I was wrong - my mom and I ordered the pad Thai and the seafood curry with coconut rice. Unlike most other Thai places that use ketchup for the tang of pad Thai, Maenam uses the real OG tamarind to flavour their noodles. Raw bean sprouts that get \\"cooked\\" after you mix the noodle dish up, lime, chilli pepper and ground nuts. And most important of all it had the smokiness of a hot wok that added an indescribable aroma. The coconut rice was fragrant, and was prefect accompaniment to the seafood curry.

I have been to many locations in several different states & this was by far the worst. First of all the place was freezing even though they claimed the A/C wasn't on (but you could hear it coming on & off). Our server Leslie was super sweet but that's where her service ends. What she had in being friendly and sweet was lost by her lack of service and being attentive. I could understand if the place was busy but there was only 7 other tables in the place so busy wasn't an issue. On to the food - we started off with a Caesar salad and Tomato Basil soup (which were endless with our entree's). The salad was over dressed and the dressing was not right. The soup was served cold. We managed to get through the first serving and thankfully we were NEVER offered a second because we would've declined. I ordered Pasta Milano which was served a bit hotter than the soup but still on the cold side. It did have good flavor but it was hard to get through the bowl since it was so cold. We also ordered a margherita pizza which was disgusting. It came with raw dough and sent back just to be returned again with raw dough. A gentlemen who I assume was the manager was very nice & apologized, offered to replace it and suggested trying a flatbread. It again came out extremely undercooked. After this third attempt at trying a simple pizza - we were done. The staff apologized again for the mistakes but that didn't help since my spouse left hungry after not being able to eat. Again, I could excuse these mistakes if the place was busy but with as slow as they were - every order should have been flawless. In my opinion they don't seem to care since it's a tourist destination and they will get business regardless but I'm hoping this review makes people think twice about eating here"},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We love terry blacks!!!

Upon first sip of the marg, I must admit it was a bit tangier than expected. This isn't a bad thing. In fact, I'm glad it wasn't super sweet like many margaritas tend to be. I'll also say, however, that it wasn't amazing, especially for $9.75. Overall, I'd say I wasn't blown away by the marg, though I also wasn't disappointed. The proportion of tequila to lime to sugar was also satisfactory, and I could also tell that it was freshly squeezed.\\n\\nI ended up ordering a spicy chorizo taco out of temptation (pictured below) and it was, unfortunately, sub par. The tortilla was great. It had the fresh corn taste I would expect from any good taco place. The meat, however, mostly tasted like salty tofu. That may not be the best analogy, but the most prominent flavor of the taco was table salt.

Smaller sides such as bread, BBQ sauce, pickles, onions, and pickled carrots are all self serving at the end of the line, and proportions are paid out by the pound. Luckily, my party came in between lunch and dinner hours at around ~4 pm, in which it was surprisingly not packed and everything on the menu was still in stock.\\n\\nMy party of 4 people decided to try a bit of everything: the sausage, pork ribs, chopped beef, and the Texas staple of brisket. Along with a couple of slices of bread, pickles, green beans, and creamed corn on the side. Given that one of my friends that was currently having his first Texas BBQ experience loved the food, there's no greater indicator than that to show how delicious the grub was. My only complaint would probably be the fact that their 'Ghost Pepper BBQ Sauce' didn't actually have any ghost peppers in it, and as such it wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be.\\n\\nAlthough the pricing does not deem to be the most fitting for the 'weekly regular' status for one with a university student budget, I would most definitely come back on the special occasion.

What I didn't finish I took it to go they gave me a to go box but had no bags available. Which did make it hard to walk back to the airport because I had my carry on and a teddy bear with me. I ate a couple more slices of the pizza on the plane. Happy to report pizza still really good when cold hahaha and my Icelandic Family ate the rest and they loved it as well. Overall my experience at Santarpio's was everything and more what you can expect from a restaurant. However if your looking for a quick meal for one probably wouldn't recommend it as your first option but if you don't mind having leftovers this pizza is definitely worth it!

I'd say it's decent. Definitely not the best fried chicken. It was crispy. There were areas where it was just batter and no chicken. It reminded me of home cooking which I guess is what this place is about; Mom and Pop kinda vibe. The waffles were good. They are liege waffles with some foam butter. Delish. \\n\\nSad to say though, with all these new brunch places popping up in Vancouver, this one didn't quite make it. Taste is average, presentation is as well.

It doesn't get much more Greek than that. Well....maybe they could add some chokes. :)  I was curious why there was no sauce. Usually even on a savory there is some kind of aioli, remoulade or something. It also had a hard cook on it where as I'm accustomed to a softer shell that I just cut up. I deconstructed it and noticed it was quite large and had many folds in it when my lightbulb finally went off. At the same time the kind young man who was doing double duty as cashier and server noticed the look on my face, came over and said \\"it's a sandwich\\"! Yasss!! I had just gotten it.

The customization part comes when you pick the type of noodle (thin or thick), broth consistency, noodle consistency, and other options. Full menu available on their site.\\n\\nMy usual is Shio at any given ramen restaurant, but I actually quite prefer the Classic/signature broth here! It's slightly creamy and more flavourful than their Shio. The spicy sauce goes better with the Classic/signature broth, too. Not so well with the Shio, in my opinion. I also like the classic thin noodles better than the thick ones. The classic thin noodles sounds like they're especially thin but it's more like the usual ramen noodle thickness, maybe just slightly thinner. It's nice when cooked Firm. I like the broth Strong. I didn't find Strong to be especially overpowering so I would hesitate to go below Strong. Although, I'm unsure what they actually mean by Light, Standard and Strong broth. I found that the Standard for everything else works out great!\\n\\nThe Chashu (meat) is nice but quite thinly sliced. The Chashu-men options give you 6 slices, versus the 2 slices you get with the regular option. No egg or other trimmings, unfortunately.

In mine, I'll find round trip tickets to LA for $250 three hours after I book them for $400. I'll lose my cell phone in a bar, buy a new one, and have the old one returned a day later. In the case of Phara's, I found the single best first date place in Austin. This, of course, occurred shortly after I entered a committed relationship where I don't anticipate ever having another first date. FML\\n\\nPhara's is a very deceptive little restaurant. It's across the street from a heavy metal pizza place and a sex toy store. It looks tiny when you enter it but it has a HUGE patio an private room. \\n\\nGeneral impressions - First date restaurants say a lot about you. If it is off the beaten path and unique it shows that you are smarter than the last guy she went out with. If it is a unique cuisine it shows that you are more cultured. If it is dark and romantic it shows that you are ...um.... dark and romantic. Point is, for a first date it doesn't hurt to appear romantic, cultured and smart. If you are all of those things and you do NOT bring up an Ex or say something about \\"looking everywhere for the right girl because you are tired of banging random bar sluts every weekend\\" you might actually get to third base. Whatever. Point is, inside or on the patio Phara's has a great ambiance and general vibe. \\n\\nFood/Drinks - IMPORTANT - Phara's is BYOB so make sure that you bring whatever it is that you plan on drinking. NOW: they DO charge a $3 per person corking fee but if you think about it, a bottle of wine that sells in a store for $18 will usually cost $40 in a restaurant so you are getting out pretty cheap... especially if you are going to go through multiple bottles and in reality, a restaurant DOES need to turn a profit so I won't complain about an extra $3 a person. \\nFood - We ordered the Mezza sampler and it was incredible. The hummus was fresh, the tzatziki was great, everything was wonderful. For my entree I ordered the Beef Tenderloin La Zeez which was absolutely incredible. It is prepared in a habanero garlic sauce which is spicy and delicious and can be tempered with the tzatiki sauce if you are a little girly man. \\n\\nService - Our waiter, Orion (I think that's right), was perfect. He suggested menu items but wasn't upselling us. He let us know about everything Phara's had to offer but we never felt like it was a sales pitch and he split the entree of my girlfriend and her friend into two portions on two plates. He also let us know about upcoming events at Phara's and other amenities it had to offer. He also said that we could camp at our table as long as we wanted after we finished eating despite the fact that the restaurant wouldn't get any extra revenue from our BYOB wine. My service at Phara's was probably the best I'd had in at least a year. \\n\\nOverall - I loved Phara's and will probably go back at least once a month. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was perfect and festive and the service was impeccable. I would happily recommend it to anyone."},{"name":"Negril Jamaican Restaurant","address":"6301 Silver Star Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is good but the customer service is horrible.

I was so looking forward trying the \\"Magical Dining\\" menu. What a disappointment. It didn't represent the quality of the food I was used to get in this restaurant. I went with my family. My husband and I ordered from the Magical Dining menu, and for my kid, she ordered from the regular menu - my favorite dish Duck Breast.  For first course, we had Cesar salad, green salad and the french onion soup. They were just ok. For main entry, all the dished ordered look exactly the same, except the menu item came with mashed potatoes.  The protein (fish -think was grouper, salmon and duck) were all completely covered with this yucky sauce. You could barely see it. I kept telling my husband, these sauces look exactly the same and to me, they tasted exactly the same like some sort of sweet and sour sauce. The yellow rice that came with it, was just throw on the table with some mystery cabbage and about 5 tiny greens beans that were completely overcook. My salmon was extremely overcooked, dry, and burned - not poached as it said and very hard. So the bad cooking process was camouflage - of course - by the sauce.  When I saw the dished after waiting a considerably amount of time, I really wanted to walk out but we were starving. After finishing the meals,  I asked the server to bring the menu back as I wanted to compare the name of the sauces used especially in the duck. Again, as I said, I had this dish before and that was not the sauce used neither the protein was swimming in sauce (so un French). The waiters (yes, 3 of them) were scrambling and trying to tell me that is the sauce they always used. Excuse me, but not really. They could not even explained what was in the sauce.  \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake and the creme brulee.  The chocolate cake was a super thinly slice piece of normal cake that tasted like supermarket bought (my apologies to the supermarkets) and super dry. I am going to assume they precut these pieces and let it sit until they were ordered.  The creme brulee is supposed to be cold under the sugary melted crust. It was warm and eggy taste.\\n\\nI will recommend the Executive Chef, if you want to be part of the magical dining, remember, people come to taste your menu. A good impression will bring customers back. I ended up paying over $150 and considered one of the worst meals this year.  The best I have of this experience was their take on the Moscow Mule drink. ;)\\n\\nThe staff was friendly, but that doesn't make a patron a repeated customer.

He ordered the bartlett pear, and it was good. Sweet but not too sweet. I ordered the spiked mango tea. BIG MISTAKE. It was supposed to be sweet tea with a mango liquor and one other ingredient that I can't remember off the top of my head. It was the single worst cocktail I've ever tasted in my life... and I've ordered $3 well drinks at college bars. It tasted like rubbing alcohol with a syrupy mango mixer on top.

Ironically, given it wasn't made in real time, it didn't come out until well after my food had been served. When I got it, it was literally ice. Like imagine sucking up frost bite. It was so bad I had to say something to the bartender who then told me the whole batch was just as icy so he brought me out a turtle flavor and that was better but really nothing special and very small for the $5 cost. Honestly I just feel like if you're going to charge that for a small shake it better be made fresh. \\n\\nThe burger and onion rings were good. Not the best I've ever had and charged for separately which drives the cost up. Anyways $27 later I had a bad shake and okay burger with onion rings."},{"name":"Sea Level Oyster Bar","address":"94 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"First visit there, was not impressed with the food.

If not, you may find it mildly fun, or at least you'll like the Gl√ºhwein. It's not much for kids, though.\\n\\nFirst of all, you have to pay to get in to something that is nothing but vendors -- you have to pay to get in to spend money. You get nothing of value for your admission fee, not even a carousel ride. This is not the case in Germany, and somehow the German markets cover their costs off vendor fees.\\n\\nSecond, the vendors are mostly new age Vancouver artisans, and you'd do better at the Farmers' Market for that (bonus: no admission fee!). There's one vendor selling German wooden ornaments and pyramids, one selling tradItional stars, and then a big K√§the Wohlfahrt shop in the back (they're the overpriced one, and definitely check where that K√§the Wohlfahrt ornament was made before you spend too much...probably was not made in Germany). Otherwise, think soap and jewelry and alpaca knits and Guatemalan sweaters.\\n\\nThe food's not anything to write home about. Freybe brats ($8) are okay, probably your best bet. $20 for a schnitzel, $18 for a \\"schnitzel wrap\\" (whatever that is). $12 for a small cardboard dish (think hot dog box) of Sp√§tzle -- not even as much as comes included with your $12 Schnitzel at a restaurant in Germany (Schnitzel isn't really street food).\\n\\nFor kids, there's a mini carousel and a small igloo where you can learn penguin facts. My kid, who knows the German markets, expected more and was bored. If you have a kid, Aurora Winter Fest or Van Dusen Festival of Lights would be a better bet.\\n\\nThat said, if you want to spend $35 on a nice day to stand outside and look at the mountains while drinking Gl√ºhwein and eating Hax'n, there are definitely worse ways to spend your money."},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We just waited 1.5 hours only to have our table given away by the hostess to another party she called after us because she forgot where she asked us to stand.

My last visit was quite disappointing service-wise, our server Kylene just kind of forgot about us. We had to ask for bread where it is usually brought to the table without asking, our drinks took forever, and it took her a while to take our order. She said she had a big table that kept her busy. Really?? What kind of an excuse is this? If you are in the weeds, don't take an additional table. Why would I care about her other tables. If I go out, I expect excellent service no matter what.\\n\\nThat said, the food here is good, if a bit too heavy on the oil. But that's Greek, I get it.\\nThey have two different food menus, one for the dining room, one for the bar. I'd recommend asking for both as there is a difference in price but not the size (which is strange). The waitress first said that the bar menu offers smaller portions but then when our items were brought to the table, she said the portions are actually the same.\\n\\nHere are some of the menu items I've tried here through my visits. \\n\\nApps: \\n- \\"Kyma's Been off the Menu for Years, Non-Stop-Ordered\\" Baby Back Pork Ribs - excellent. Fall-off-the bone tender deliciousness;\\n- Truffled Veal Sweetbread Nuggets \\"Professionally Cooked the Way They Should Be\\" - these were a-ok, we ordered sauce on the side and with quinoa salad (the salad was too citrus-y for my taste);\\n- Calamari pasta - this dish had a strange consistency and texture, not my favorite;\\n- Braised lamb cheeks - good but not as tender as ribs and quite fatty;\\n- grilled octopus - some of the best in Atlanta.\\n\\nDishes:\\n- Giant prawns  - perfectly cooked and very juicy;\\n- Lamb 3 ways - I expected it to be more tender and juicy.\\n\\nThey have a very well stocked bar and a small patio although the outside tables are tiny if you plan on eating al fresco.\\n\\nOverall: if you like greek food, you will like this place."},{"name":"New Hing's Restaurant & Lounge","address":"527 Main St","city":"Oregon City","stars":"3.5","text":"I have a thing for soup.

The entire cocktails list is on special during HH for $8. \\nThe Tia Grima was our favourite because of it spicy notes (habanero) and balance of sweet and bitter (pineapple and Amaro). \\nThe Virginia Vargas was a bit too sweet for us, tastes like fruit punch.\\nThe Teresa Izquierdo tastes, as my hubs called it, the \\"Caesar's of Peru\\", a bit salty, and savoury due to the jalapeno infused Pisco, ginger syrup, and orange peel bitters. Our second favourite.\\nThe Claudia Llosa tastes like a milky sweet tea with its Yerba Mate Pisco and egg whites.

First spot we visit upon arrival. There was a long line outside the door and the place look huge. The line moved fairly quick, thank goodness because it was sizzling hot outside. Theres a window outside where you can knock and order a cold beer while waiting (cc only). Theirs lots of table inside and outside seatings. First, you order your sides and drinks. Second, you order the meat and pay. It's an assembly line. After you paid, find an open table and chow. Theres also a self serve condiments section, utensils and Togo boxes. Food is a bit pricey. Now, let's get to the best part (the food). We got 1 lb of brisket, 1/4 lb of sausage (jalapeno), 1.5 lbs beef ribs, cream corn, red rice, beans and beer of course. We chatted a little with the guy and he gave us some extra sausage and pork rib to try. Oh em gee, brisket was so flavorful with perfect amount of fat and meat. Meat melts in your mouth. I was excited to try the beef rib because I'm such a carnivore. I was dissatisfied with the beef rib because I find it toooo salty, meat falls off the bone with perfect smoked ring around it but it was over seasoned. I was amazed and loved the sample pork rib, it was the best of them all-perfection!!!!"},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This was my first time having Ethiopian food and it was delicious.

The young host put our name in, and said it should be around a 40-50 minute wait. We were totally fine with that, so she put our name on the waitlist and we left. This is the reason why I gave this establishment only 2 stars. We decided to walk around & came back towards the 45-50 minute mark, and was told it was going to be around another 10 minute wait. That was fine because we've seen many other restaurants busy, and had long waits as well. Upon going in around 10-15 minutes later another hostess said it would be at least another 20-25 minute wait. The thing that aggravated us the most is why are you telling people a less wait time if it's going to be close to an hour & 1/2 wait. In this case we could have seen if there were a shorter wait somewhere else since the area is packed with restaurants. This point we were so hungry we waited the extra time. Shoved into a corner, the restaurant does have a nice display of seeing the chefs cook. However they need sound panels in the restaurant because you can't hear the person talking to you from across the table. It sounds like a rowdy bar inside, meanwhile it's supposed to be a fine dining restaurant. The best touch was all the fruit flies stuck to the mirror and flying around in front of our faces. I get it, it's a food establishment and the doors are open but their is fly bait you can spray near the floor that attracts them. The food was amazing, I got to give them 5 stars for that.

The parking lot situation is hellish. It's a war zone. The line almost always has 9 or more people in front of you and moves slowly. Lately they are always very backed up.

The spiced pumpkin filling was creamy.  The apple and raisin compote was nice; it was not sweet with just a little spice.  Surprisingly, the tart shell was half an inch thick.  It was not a 'sweet dough' as it was described.  It was actually bitter because it was browned.\\n\\nThey used some syrup to stick the Pumpkin Tart onto the cardboard underneath to prevent it from moving.  But they did not do that for the Pistachio Opera Cake.  Also, they did not tape the bottom of the paper cup of Savarin onto the box and therefore it moved inside the box and ruined other cake slices.\\n\\nIt was odd that the server only wore a glove in one hand but he used both hands to touch everything (e.g. the box, the paper, the tape, the pen).

Crepe are made efficiently and quickly so don't let the line deter you.\\n\\nMy friend and I both got the Wobbles ($8) which is a crepe filled with chicken, turkey, your choice of cheese, mushrooms, onions, spinach, tomatoes and a cajun remoulade sauce. The turkey was chopped up bits and the chicken was seasoned and cubed. There was a lot of protein in this crepe, so much that it was falling apart as I ate it. I was a little hesitant that the Cajun remoulade would be too spicy (I don't do spicy) and when the employee told me it was a 3 out of 10 on spicy scale I opted to have it on the side. It turned out that it wasn't too spicy at all- I'd go ahead and have it in the crepe next time. \\n\\nWe also ordered a Gilberto ($7) to share. I paid for it with my savory crepe but the employees made it fresh for us when we'd taken our last bites of our Wobbles. This sweet crepe is filled with strawberries, bananas, nutella, whipped cream and chocolate syrup. I've had a version of this crepe in several places and you simply can't go wrong. It was ready just in time for dessert and presented prettily. Half was the perfect amount as they are quite substantial. I found myself wishing they made the s'more crepe- maybe its a seasonal item. They serve local craft beer and mimosas too which would be fun to have with a breakfast crepe. Crepevine offers a quick, healthier alternative to the other fast food restaurants near Altamonte Mall and is definitely worth a stop."},{"name":"Les Faux Bourgeois","address":"663 E 15th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Celebrating Valentine's Day a month late, my bf surprised me by taking me to Les Faux (although I had a hunch!) He even rented a car so we could come (awwww). It was 7:30 and we got a parking spot right outside the front door, walked in to a small group waiting and was lucky to have had reservations from two weeks ago.\\n\\nWe were seated at a two-seater in the middle of the restaurant and I admired the wooden decor and light fixtures that looked like upside down water jugs. I was immediately impressed as I had no idea that this place would be this pretty.\\n\\nOur server had a strong french accent but was friendly and patient. I asked him to suggest a wine with my meal and although he wasn't sure what to offer me, he came back with a very traditional tasting Cab White. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, Bf and I decided to share the onion tart, which came with a side tomato salad. The tart was shaped like a waffle, perfect for sharing. The pastry was flaky and buttery and the shredded onion was delicate and delightful in addition to the lardons and cheese that made a perfect combination. I was super impressed and couldn't wait for my main to come.\\n\\nFirst thing I thought of when ordering my main was the (of course) 101's Best Eats.. - the STEAK FRITES! but rarely do I eat steak.. but then I really wanted to try it because it was on the list... but I didn't want the list to steer me away from something I really wanted to try. I scanned the menu several times.. and to my own surprise - I did end up wanting to get the steak frites over anything else.... yes I got it medium well and I am sure half of you are thinking that I am crazy. My intuition was that chefs always cook it one level rarer anyway.\\n\\nI didn't realize that the hanger steak was going to be sliced, but I'm glad they did... BUT.. the edges of the steak was a little tough I must admit, although the inner slices were savoury and juicy. The dim lighting in the restaurant can be a great advantage to a restaurant because although it can set a romantic atmosphere, it also prevents you from seeing exactly how your food was cooked. The fries were hot and crispy, with potato in the middle. The garlic butter was indeed garlicky, I couldn't get enough. The sauce was nice, although I wish there was more (I'm just being greedy). For a meal like this less than $20, I think it's a steal.\\n\\nBf got the tenderloin which was mouthwatering and melted in your mouth. It was absolutely wonderful. The mashed potato was more like a potato stack, like pasta piled in a lasagna but it was creamy and hearty. It was also recommended by the waiter and I can see why.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got a lemon tart, and a pear tarte tartin (special). The lemon tart was super sweet, and although done right, it's not my preference. The biscuit was too dense for me but bf enjoyed it more than my TT which I loved because it reminded me of my fav - apple pie. The peach slices were large and the glaze was heavenly, along with the oh-so buttery crust.\\n\\nOur service was overall attentive, although closer to the end, he had disappeared for an extended period of time. However, he did take the time to cheque on us during each course. I definitely want to come back to see what other delicacies will end up in my tummy :)"},{"name":"Ron's Restaurant","address":"8869 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I have to admit that I love the vibe here.  I enjoy old diners, especially for breakfast.  I don't have high expectations for gourmet cuisine in these places, but I do expect food to be homemade.  Here, it seems a bit hit and miss.\\n\\nI had the chicken-fried steak with country gravy, hash browns and two eggs; biscuit instead of toast.  I could be wrong, but I'm fairly sure that the steak came pre-breaded out of a package.  Hashbrowns must be pre-shredded from a package, and could have used more time on the flat top.  The biscuit had an odd texture, and I'm guessing they are made with a mix of some sort.  My sunnyside-up eggs were just that, but better kitchen technique would have cooked the whites instead of leaving them gelatinous.  The shocker was the country gravy, usually a disaster at most places, but here, even though it's probably out of a can/jar, it was really tasty.  Go figure!\\n\\nThe good gravy, and attentive service are saving this review from being two stars.

My only gripe is that they don't serve macaroni side salad with their plate lunches (a pretty typical side to local hawaiian dishes) but instead give you a muai slaw claiming it's a healthier alternative. IT WAS PRETTY GOOD considering I don't like eating cole slaw very much. \\n\\nThey seem pretty popular, I went on a Tuesday, and they were out of fish from the weekend crowd. Given the fact you get almost nothing, and guaranteed crappy food at Texas State University's fabulous on campus  dining choices, save your $8 and come and get a meal from here.

We both signed and agreed to the terms of the contract. The day prior to the event, I called the restaurant to meet with him. Someone answered and told me to call later as it was not a good time. I drove by as I was nervous since the next afternoon was the event. They were having an electric issue and were trying to fix it. He finally accepted to speak to me and told me he was not sure the event would be able to go on, but he was going to call me as soon as the inspector gave him an update. When was I going to be told that if I didn't drive by? Midnight, and no call back. He calls two hours the before the actual event and says everything is fine. \\n\\nIt was not. He failed to mention the back room was not being set up, and we did not have the private event as promised as other people were dining with us in the same room that were not part of the party. The staff did not place enough tables and chairs despite having a headcount. We asked for small discount due to all the inconveniences and stress less than 24 hrs before the event without direct communication, and instead he up charged us. \\n\\nI understand that a business is a business, but when one party (the business) does not fulfill their contract it is their responsibility to accommodate the customer.

I went for the first time on a Thursday night around 6:30pm. There wasn't much of a line, but that may be because there was a forecast of snow for that night (Texans have no clue how to handle snow--yay for class being canceled the next day!). \\n\\nAs soon as you walk in, someone gives you a table number. Then, you go all the way to the back of the restaurant to order food. The menu is short and sweet. There are about 10 burgers to choose from, some sides, and then drinks on the back. \\n\\nI had the Shrooms Burger: mushrooms, goat cheese, and pesto, and my cousin had the burger on special--the Diablo Burger: habanero peppers and chipotle mayo. We split our burgers so I got to taste both. We also got an order of the chili cheese fries. I love mushrooms and pesto, so I was very happy with my Shrooms Burger. I was also pleasanty surprised that the Diablo Burger was actually pretty spicy (I was expecting \\"spicy\\" to really equal mild). The Diablo Burger is amazing if you can handle the heat. I was doing fine until my last bite when I got a huge chunk of habanero peppers. BURN! I then proceeded to shame my Asian heritage and was forced to ask for a glass of milk. The employee I asked was very friendly and got me a glass of soothing goodness, free of charge. The chili cheese fries were tasty. I like that the chili cheese comes on the side for dipping. So whether you like to dip, drizzle, or monsoon your cheese on, everyone leaves happy. The fries were a little salty, but that's forgivable. Oh and if you're a root beer fan, this is the place for you. They have Maine Root Root Beer at the fountain station, so you can fill up to your heart's content. I'm also a fan of the home-made sauces: chipotle ketchup and horseradish mustard. \\n\\nI will definitely be making a trip back to try some of the other burgers, and maybe to grab a beer.

Theirs is on tap. This paired with their overpriced, middle of the road food makes for a spot that couldn't be less authentic"},{"name":"Gurkha Himalayan Kitchen","address":"1141 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"TLDR: unauthentic, and the cooks do not have even a basic understanding of Indian spices and flavours. However, it is relatively healthy and if you can get past the mediocre taste a tolerably filling meal.\\n\\nOnto the review:\\n\\nAs I am Indian, while I adore many cuisines and many flavours, the one thing I cannot live without is a proper full course dinner. An Indian dinner is incomplete without dal, salad, rice, a main and at least one other side + chutney/pickles. \\n\\nNow generally we do manage this sort of a dinner 2-3 times a week (not an easy feat I tell you, when you're in your mid twenties living in Canada). Sometimes, however, we just cannot pull it off and not only that but the thought of substituting such a dinner with a small one-course relatively less healthy meal (even if it is equally delicious) is absolutely soul crushing. \\n\\nWe have frequently had this sort of a dilemma. In such desperate cases we have absolutely no choice but to eat at a restaurant offering such a meal. The closest and only one in my vicinity is Gurkha Himalayan Cuisine. \\n\\nOn the menu it is called Nepali Bhojan with a vegetarian and a non vegetarian option. I always choose the vegetarian and my bf gets the non vegetarian. They both come with dal, roti, basmati white rice, salad, raita and kheer. The vegetarian thali (plate) comes with a mustard greens 'shaak' (a vegetable main), and another shaak made with beans. The non vegetarian comes with sherpa chicken and gorkhali khasi. I will not review everything individually including our appetisers - Tenzing Momos (Nepali chicken dumplings)\\n\\nTenzing Momos: 3/5 it's hard to screw up momos but these were certainly mediocre in comparison to what I've had near Nepal. Compared to what I've had in Vancouver, however, they hold up but are still on the lower spectrum. I'd rank them third best out of the only four restaurants that serve Momos in Vancouver and the restaurant at number four is absolutely awful. The second best is only at second because it's chutneys are better. The Momos themselves were equally mediocre. \\n\\nDal: 3/5 very difficult to screw up dal but it goes down to the cooks having no concept of Indian spices or flavours. It wasn't done well but it wasn't done terribly either, at least, there were no nasty clashing flavours like I've sadly experienced in other Indian restaurants in BC. \\n\\nRoti: 4.5/5 I like roti and it was done right, nothing spectacular, it's not meant to be spectacular but it's meant to be a pleasant accompaniment. They achieved this. It's cut into a weird triangular shape which forces me to eat it in a wrong, awkward way but I won't argue.\\n\\nRaita: 4/5 It's raita. If anyone screws this up I'll give up on life. Actually, I change my mind - I've definitely experienced some unbelievably horrid Indian food in this part of the world and I won't risk betting on it. \\n\\nKheer: 1/5 Absolutely disgusting. Tastes like whipped cream and water. I don't understand it. It has a 1 because it's got the right colour to resemble kheer. Good job! \\n\\n[Now one piece of advice: ALWAYS order mild spice at this place!\\n\\nMy bf asked to have it at the regular level of spice as they would normally cook it (basically a polite way of saying stop white washing the food for me) however, we were told there is no regular and we have to choose. We chose medium and hot. BIG mistake. Regardless of whether you like spicy, can handle spicy, or whatever it is. Do NOT ask for medium or hot. Unless you like the taste of burning, dry, nasty powdery red chilli powder in your mouth as you eat. \\n\\nOnce you order mild (as I did the last time I was there) the food is tolerable. Mild is how it's made. Medium and hot just means they dump in chilli powder just before they serve it. I'm cringing as I type. ]\\n\\nThe following ratings are for the mains cooked with mild level spice. \\n\\nMustard greens shaak: 4/5 Not bad. Healthy and tastes pretty good. Without the chilli powder I quite like it. I don't like the potatoes that come with it but that's not the cooks fault. Toddler-me has hated potatoes in shaak and I just can't grow out of that dislike. \\n\\nBeans shaak: 4/5 I liked this too. I believe this had bamboo shoots inside which is quite foreign to me but it's very harmonious since Nepali cuisine has a strong Chinese influence. This dish is bland in comparison to what it should be. But in comparison to what there is in Canada it holds up. \\n\\nI won't review the Sherpa Chicken and Gorkhali khasi. I've never had either, they're foreign words and foreign names and foreign flavours. I assume they're Nepali traditional dishes. The flavours are not 100% correct is all I can tell, but they are apparently bearable as my bf likes them."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"4608 West Gate Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Food here is amazing!

We were greeted by the owner and he very warmly answered many of our questions and made us feel very comfortable as if we were eating dinner at a friend's home! He offered us to taste one of his favorite wines, and we ended up buying the entire bottle to enjoy with dinner. I was very pleased to find out they give complimentary naan panir sabzi! At some Persian restaurants, you have to order it as an appetizer. And the naan... oh that naan was so unique and delicious-- I can't compare it to any other roti, naan, lavash, or flatbread I have ever had in my life. We started our meal by ordering the Tahdig and Kashk o bademjan. I could not say it was too much different than what I have had at other restaurants, but none the less it was still very delicious! I ordered the Chicken Barg, and it was cooked to perfection! Every bite was so tender. My boyfriend ordered the Lamb Shank and it was so good. Usually I find that lamb has an overwhelming flavor profile and the stews may be too fatty, but Persepolis made me fall in love with their lamb. The stew that the shank sat in was so delicate and full of flavor! My father ordered the kubideh kebab, and wow... their kubideh was the best I have had in my life. It was SO SOFT AND SUCCULENT. I usually have had kubideh that is dry and too pungent of a beef flavor which left me feeling like I have a brick in my stomach, but just like the Lamb Shank, the kubideh was delicate in flavor and texture which I loved. For dessert we ordered faloodah which was not what we were expecting it to be like (we were imagining an Indian style faloodah), but it was still very good for what it was! We also ordered baklava which I do have to say was ordinary, but I really loved the cherry sauce they put on the bottom which added a nice flavor. \\n\\nI have no complaints. Food was amazing.

We've passed by on our other trips but never had a reservation before. This was our first time dining here and it wasn't the best run restaurant.

There were plenty of tables empty in the restaurant, but people were being told that there would be at least an hour wait, and people who were checking in for their reservations were still waiting at the front as well. It took a bit for the servers/hosts to come collect us and seat us, and after I was seated, I noticed that a lot of the staff was just standing around and talking to one another (which is my guess of why the service is slow/varied). Our server was great, and friendly, but I can't say the same about the other staff I observed.

It is a must try if you're a cucumber lover like me. \\n\\nThe Nasi Goreng was our least favorite dish. There was nothing wrong with it, it had very full flavor and the shrimp was cooked well.

I kid you not I wanted to take a vat of them home with me. We only got them to round out our choices and get some veggies in...a last minute add on but we're so glad we did. \\n\\nWe also loved the spring rolls, dumplings, and bao buns.

Its been there a long time, its consistently ranked as Boston's best pizza and the food looks old-school.\\nIs this good pizza? Maybe for Boston? But like they say even bad pizza is still good pizza. I wanted to like this more than I did. It's good for what it is but compared to NYC, this place doesn't come close. The crust is chewy and at least in the two times we tried pies, the crust was cooked to the point of 'char'. They seem to think the black burnt edges of the crust adds to the flavor. I would prefer a little less of that. The crust itself is dense and I think it needs to be to handle the amount of cheese and toppings they load on. They are not shy about adding the cheese. The toppings all seem fresh and good quality. The sauce is your typical pizza sauce. As others pointed out the sauce and toppings are so loaded on the crust ends up falling apart into sogginess. It all comes together for a heavy gut busting slice and you probably won't be able to get more than two or three pieces down.\\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone to try once. But there are too many great modern pizza places in Boston's North End to go back again.\\nThey are also known for their side dishes of lamb, steak tips or sausage. We weren't impressed and I wouldn't bother ordering unless you have a craving you just have to feed. The steak tips were grilled nicely but the meat was tough and seemed like a bad value for the price. Even worse was the sausage link which was a single link. They claim they make their own sausage but I didn't find anything to brag about there. It's just a regular old Italian sausage. We passed on the lamb.\\nThis place is located in a neighborhood near Logan airport that is a pain in the ass to get to but once you are there you wonder how cool it would be to live there.

I visited this restaurant last night with my wife and daughter.  Upon entering I placed my name on the waiting list. I felt confident we'd be seated shortly considering there no other parties ahead of us; we were top of the list.  Then for next 45 minutes we watched 26 people be seated, including people that came in after us and put their name on the list. I assume some had reservations but clearly some did not.  This is a small place so that was about half of the capacity.  It was obvious they were seating larger parties ahead of us (pushing two 4-tops together).  When I mentioned to a few of the staff (no one was managing the list) that they were seating people ahead of us, rather than apologize they argued with me and said those groups were waiting outside and got there ahead of us.  That was non-sense because when we got there no one was waiting outside or inside.  And again, we were at the top of the list.  So I can't comment on the food but the service/hospitality was horrible.  I travel extensively in both N. America and Europe and this was the worst service I have experienced.
