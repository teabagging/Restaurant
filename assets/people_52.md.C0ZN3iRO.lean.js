The waitress went on a lengthy explanation of how the cups are scratched from being stacked and did not change the cups. I can understand that she wants to defend her restaurants image by explaining the cup was not dirty, but quite frankly if a customer is uncomfortable and requests for a new cup, it is really not that big of a deal to get us a new one.

One is to go the \\"grease laden absorb this belly full of booze\\" route. This usually involves burritos, grilled cheese, crab rangoons, and/or street meat. Delicious going down, regrettable the next morning, this route usually works better when you've REALLY had too much to drink. The other path is the \\"I'm buzzed and hungry but not yet drunk enough to think that a sausage cart is an appropriate place to purchase a meal\\" route. And at the end of this path is Ginza. Raw fish may not serve as a very good alcohol absorber, but it sure does taste delicious going down, without the regrettable next morning. Honestly, walks of shame are bad enough as it is, do you really need to add a stomachache to the equation? \\n\\nThe Ginza experience starts as soon as you walk in. Clean and attractive, the space definitely makes you feel comfortable with consuming large amounts of uncooked food. Their sushi is generous, big hunks of tender unagi, hamachi, and ebi laid across perfectly sticky rice. While makis aren't typically my jam, the ones here are an exception, loaded with fish and not just the avocado/spicy sauce/cucumber filler that is so often the maki downfall. I even like their spider maki, which is typically an overpriced, under crabbed disaster in my book. Here large hunks of soft shell crab spill out of each roll, ensuring that you will look like a pig trying to cram it all in. For appetizers (ok, ok, so I do need a LITTLE bit of absorbing) the tofu in fish broth is fantastic, crispy on the outside, soft and silky on the inside, in a wonderfully mild clear fish soup, it's a perfect belly warmer, especially when paired with a cold Asahi. The gyoza is passable, which just leaves more room for the fish. Bonus. \\n\\nStaff is courteous and polite, if not overly friendly. I'm not sure how overly friendly I'd be with a roomful of drunken patrons either.

Although a decent size, the lobster meat was absolutely disgusting. So tough and rubbery and totally void of any lobster flavor. You could tell this was low quality scraps when you look into the bin holding the lobster and crab legs. The lobster had pieces of claws and legs randomly drifting about and much of the shells were black! The crab legs were not much better. I would say 80% of the crab legs in the bin were the small tiny ones no one wants. I've been to a lot of buffets in my time but I can't remember the last time I left one hungry.

He has been telling everyone about it and giving it to friends for gifts for awhile now. As a fan my husband, father and I headed out to this new location on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  We arrived around 2:45pm and bought tickets for the 3pm tour.  With the purchase of the tour you get two drink tickets or trade one drink ticket in for a tasting all for $20.  Most people get a drink before the tour and carry them with the tour.  We didn't have time so went straight to the area the tour was to begin.  The tours are purchased in the gift shop area. We had Rob (guy that has been friend with owner for 20 years) as our tour guide.  It is hard for me to review the tour because he kept getting interrupted by this young man. Come to find out the young man is actually doing marketing for another distillery in the area.  As such, I think Rob was off his game, losing his place in his standard tour.  It was a tad hard to follow.  If you have never done a distillery tour I could see you being really confused post this tour.  We have done them all over the country so we got the concept.  My only complaint to Rob was how it was ended.  It appears he was going to help a different guy on the tour, this one is opening a distillery in Tulsa.  Basically, he walked off with that guy to his truck to give him his contact information.  We were standing there guessing it was over?  Tour lasted about 35 minutes.  I was also surprised they let dogs in the distillery. \\n\\nPost the tour we headed to the Rick House to get our drinks.  A large menu of options.  No one was in line and it was easy to purchase.  Rick House is large and has a few tables and couches.  There are many games in there as well.  We went and sat out by the fire pit tables.  They were setting up music next to the gift shop.  After our first drinks we decided we need to eat.  This part needs to be improved.  By 4:15pm they were out of a few things.  I get it.  However, maybe a sign that says this and that are sold out?  So as we are standing in line we can make other choices.  We had to order for my dad as we didn't want to go out and ask him.  We had to make a quick decision at the front of the line.  It does appear someone went to the store and got more stuff as the afternoon went on we saw people with the sold out items.  Also by 4pm the Rick House needs more than four people working in it.  The lines were really long and barely moving.  Nice touch to have the pagers so people do not have to wait by the counter. \\n\\nBy 5pm someone came and put more wood in the fire pit.  It started right up.  The grounds are dog friendly.  The buildings are open building with barn doors and the dogs are allowed in them as well.  Plenty of space for kids to run around and plenty of things for them to play with.  Probably the most kid friendly distillery I have been to.  Gift shop has many things to purchase.  Cute shirts and unique syrups. Shirts sizes were limited.  Appeared they have been popular.  Overall a nice vibe they have going on.  I hate to tell people about it because like most things in Austin it will be packed.  Glad we got to experience it.  Happy to see a family have success.  It was nice seeing the owners cute girls run around, his parents beaming with pride and his wife on the property.  His mom's cooking is famous in some parts of Texas.  Happy to support and it doesn't hurt that the product is a quality product.  As a family we enjoy the entire line.

The place is cute inside and I love the fact that it's local and has a farm feel.  Anyway, I ordered the cheddar bacon burger and was slightly above average.  The bun and bacon were good but the burger was below average mainly because it was fatty and sub-par quality meat.  I buy organic beef hamburger at Costco and my burgers have a better flavor and less grease.  At first I thought it was the bacon and cheese that was so greasy but I ate the meat separately and it was indeed the patty that was dripping with grease.  With good beef, this burger could be as good as Mighty Fine but right now, theirs is a 4 1/2 and this one is more like a 3 1/2.  Another thing that I didn't like is the odd little licorice tasting (fennel?) seeds sprinkled on the burger.

The place was packed to the brim at 1130am on a Friday and there were only two people attending to a crowd of over fifty people.\\n\\nNo one acknowledged our presense and we had to stand and wait to be seat for about fifteen minutes.  While standing there I could see that there was only one table open, but it had not been cleared of dishes from the prior guests (it actually never got cleared for the whole hour and a half that we were there and when we left it still was dirty).  We finally got a table because the couple sitting at the table bused their own table before they left.\\n\\nAfter sitting at our table for a few minutes, someone finally came and grabed the prior guest's credit card slip but did not bring us menus until a few more minutes tick on.  Once we go our menus and were ready to order, we had to flag someone down and have them take our order.  It was at this point that things got better for the Crawfish Shack and Oyster Bar.  \\n\\nWe got our food in a timely manner and it was tasty.  We ordered a large bowl of gumbo, crawfish ettouffee, butterfly shrimp, two dozen oysters and four pounds of crawfish.  I was all fresh and delicious!  The oysters were fresh and they really provide you with a LARGE bowl of gumbo and ettoufee!  We ordered our crawfish spicy and they were hot and good, but not as spicy as I would have liked.  The crawfish boil may not be typical because it had a few mushrooms, onions, and some ears of corn (you get one small ear of corn per two pounds of crawfish).\\n\\nOn a side note, after eating all of that great food I went to the bathroom to wash up and got to observe the restroom and it was not too pretty.  I was small and cramp and kind of dingy, enough said.\\n\\nAll in all this place has good cajun food, but it lacks quality services when they seem to be busy.  It really seemed as if the waitstaff was truly overwhelmed with the number of guests and they definitely need a busboy to clear off the tables so they can seat more guests.  Because they were so crowded, their service really suffered and I observed many potential guest walk out because they got tired of waiting and some of the people who were seated had to have their food boxed up because they ran out of time to eat and get back to work.\\n\\nGood food, but avoid eating here during rush hour periods."},{"name":"Buckeye Pho","address":"761 Bethel Rd, Ste E195","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is a really nice shop!

They start at 9 plus toppings and specialty start between 13-15 for that 9 inch.  The pizzas were inconsistently topped between the tree we ordered with sauces and cheese.  The ovens were clearly off in terms of temperate because half were burnt and the other have was perfectly cooked.  I was honestly surprise they would have served them with the level of burnt they came to the table looking.  The drought was wonderful.  Perfectly thick ratio to having a crisp bottom and still chewy crust.  My thought is keep the menu price the same and increase your 9 to a 12 inch and people will feel a better value.

Basil was thin.  \\n\\nMy husband got the ranch with hot chicken and a few other in the speciality menu and he was done with his pizza before I finished my third small piece.

Old school with a slightly modern twist. Same went for the drink menu...old standbys, new concoctions and everything served in a variety of funked out glasses. I had the Corpse Reviver #2 (gin, cointreau, lillet, lemon absinthe) and it is probably the first time in ages i really nurtured a drink. Yes, i'm a bit of a lush.

The rice took forever to come, it was actually the last thing the waiter came to get.\\n\\nBut before I even talked about food, I've already touched upon that, the waiter took forever to take our orders. He began to take 2 people's orders at my table of friends and then proceeded to say, WAIT. And  then walked away to take orders from another table! After we had already been waiting for I would say more than 15-20 minutes.\\n\\nWhen we finally ate, got ALL our orders (they took forever to come), and we handed him money for a check, he proceeded to say: Tip is 15%. And held his hand out. Excuse me? Every restaurant I have went to I have paid tip AFTER I have received the receipt for the bill. Absurd for a waiter to be asking that after we had just handed him the money. He did not smile at all, except when we handed him the money, and frowned when asking for tip. \\n\\nHe handed us take out boxes when we wanted to put our leftovers in them, but they are supposed to take the dishes and put the leftovers in for us.

My friends and I have been going here for years since we started exploring Boston as a college town. One weekend, we stumbled upon this place because we heard someone say \\"Dim Sum, over here\\" and our stomachs led us right to the source. As we climbed the stairs covered on both sides by funky mirrors, we could smell the food just wafting down onto the street. We got up there, and it was pure chaos - GOOD chaos though. The carts were being pushed around, bouncing from table to table, and I don't think we could see a face that was disappointed at all. We were totally sold.\\n\\nTo actually review the place, I'd say that the atmosphere is perfect for Dim Sum. It's not the quiet sit down restaurant that you might want for a date. It's the kind of noisy restaurant that you would want to go to with your friends if ya'll just wanted to stuff your faces.\\n\\nThe food is just amazing. From the Char Siu Bao (Pork Buns) to the shrimp dumplings, including those long shrimp noodles that I'm ADDICTED TO, you won't be disappointed when a cart comes around. There's always something different.\\n\\nThe only downside (for some people) that I could see is that little to none of the staff really speaks a whole lot of English, but in my opinion, that just adds to the ambiance and experience. To just point at an item that looks good and go with it is just what you have to do with Dim Sum, and the China Pearl delivers on that front.\\n\\nIn the end, they add up all of the stamps that you have accumulated, and more times than not, it comes out to be really cheap. I've gone there with three people, and the bill has been around $8-$10 each. (Unless I'm having one of my days where I just eat about $30 by myself.)\\n\\nAll in all, I'd say go there.

Because it's nearby, because it sources locally and responsibly, and because of the stellar average star rating, I was hoping for something special from S&B, and got a decidedly mixed bag instead.\\n\\nWent as a party of three on a Saturday afternoon. S&B has a nice patio out front, but it was a little chilly, so we opted for inside. Waitress was nice and accommodating to my friend's newborn, we had a very nice rotating tap suggested to us (we went for it: a silky bourbon-barrel porter) and were left with the breakfast and lunch menus. I understand that there are soups and daily specials, but we never heard about them, so...\\n\\nMe mixed it up a bit, going for two of the Sala (pulled chicken sandwich in a cilantro mint yogurt), some eggs benedict, and a breakfast taco. The sandwiches were top-notch, the eggs benedict both so-so and a bit cold (probably sitting for a bit while the rest of the order came together), and the breakfast taco okay, but certainly nothing to recommend in a town with 5,000 excellent breakfast taco options--I mean, tortillas from a bag in Texas? Really? S&B makes a point of locally sourcing meat and produce, but if that's the case, why would you serve deep-fried cubed potatoes instead of some actual hashed browns with the breakfast dishes? And is the dreadful Tabasco really the best hot sauce you can stock in Austin? (I did manage to get a side of sriracha on request.) \\n\\nDespite a slow day with the place a quarter full, food also took 20-25 minutes. We weren't in a hurry, but for a fairly straightforward lunch order, that's kinda remiss. \\n\\nThere are some nice touches here: the beer and wine choices are good and reasonably priced, they play killer music (Velvet Underground, Elliot Smith), and the setup is nice and attractive. But none of that matters if the food and service isn't up to par, and I feel like that's the most accurate description that I could give. They sell  cooked meats by the pound--and that was probably the best feature of the meal--to go with sides, and I'd consider grabbing that for carryout in the future.

There were plenty of nice apple chunks in there, but other than that, this was just okay, especially for the price. Apple fritters are everywhere in New England in the fall, and this was far from what I've come to expect. The store itself is cute and trendy with its beautiful donuts on display like jewelry pieces.

It was okay --  it had a uniform texture, was cooked evenly, and had the one-dimensional flavor one expects in meatloaf.  The problem was the flavor itself, which was slightly bitter.  I probably should have expected gourmet meatloaf at a place calling itself a \\"bistro,\\" and maybe that's what people want.  I would have preferred a meatloaf made with ground beef stretched to its limit with old bread and flavored with catsup.  Any bitterness should come from scorching.  The potatoes that came with it were good, but the zucchini was an odd choice because it, too, is bitter.  My friend had the mac and cheese, which he insisted was good, but he didn't finish it, which is unusual for him.  I think he's just being positive because, overall, the experience at Mother's was nice.\\n\\nI found the portioning interesting:  the entrees were modest (as I prefer) but the desserts generous to the point of being almost ridiculous, which is the reverse of what I usually find.  I wonder if this is a Portland thing.\\n\\nHere's why I like the place and would go back.  We got there kind of late and were the last ones in the dining room.  The servers were very kind, however, and went out of their way not to make us feel rushed.  They also put care into their recommendations for beer and dessert.

It is seriously pure joy to eat.\\n\\nFruit Tarts - As good as the best fruit tart I have had in my life.  Awesome sugar crust, amazing custard filling which was creamy as can be and fresh, ripe fruit on top covered in a yummy glaze.  I wish I had one in front of me right now.\\n\\nButter cookies - Come in a variety of colors and are melt in your mouth - not too sweet, not too rich, so it's super easy to eat them to your heart's content!\\n\\nA few things to note:\\n- Although not listed on the signs in the store, they have mini cannolis in the back which are perfect to buy for a group!\\n- I can't comment on this in experience since I've never done it, but apparently you can order a package to be delivered to your home to make your own Mike's Pastry Cannolis at your own house.  They come with the filling, cannoli shells and toppings already made for you to just assemble and eat.

Low and behold I arrive on a Tuesday night, \\"Doctor Who\\" night and I say Doctor Who? I had no idea Who is and so when I walk into a full room of \\"Who\\" people I have no clue to WHO or what I am supposed to do, sit or order so I head to the bathroom to recoup. On leaving the bathroom a waiter spots a confused me and suggests that I go around the people back to the empty bar area. I order one piece of cod and a vodka tonic. Well... my bill? A surprising $11.91!!  My fish was no longer or larger than my middle finger. I was shocked at the price for such little amount. The tarter sauce was good even though I prefer it to be made with more dill. The coating on the small piece of fish was light but the bottom was greasy. The fish itself was very flaky and some what bland. The problem is for the price and portion I can't and won't go back. Sorry, still on the hunt for the best fish and chips with a great tarter sauce in the entire Northwest.

Every item was marked up between $1 or $2 from what you see on the menu. I asked and I was told \\"the menu needs to be updated.\\" How is that my issue? \\nc) you pay extra for teriyaki sauce. Why!? \\nd) the location: to get back on 2 east you have to go all the way to the rotary and go all the way around. I understand that that's not a big deal but between 4 pm and 7 pm, getting from the restaurant to the rotary can take upwards of 20 mins.

I will say this, i went to universal once a week. And when it was being constructed i was beyond excited for it to open. once that day came, and I was right there and ready to go. The theme of this resaurant is Steam Punk. if you dont know what that is, steam punk is a genre of science fiction that has a historical setting and typically features steam-powered machinery rather than advanced technology. very victorian and industrial. i can say that at first i was not expecting this theme, but it is very fictional/fantasy like, and is so different from modern today, Its very hard not to feel interested, excited, and curious;\\nBUT, its hard to look past the crowd. Seeing how it is city walk, i understood the reason for the large numbers. But, can i say that the food is worth the wait???? no. If i could compare the food to anything, i would say it is just like any other universal/city walk restaurants. All of the food was somewhat bland and lacked flavor. Was it absolutly horrible food? no. Was it worth the wait and money? no. would i return? just for the desserts. now the desserts are a differnet story. the beautifully crafted milkshakes they offer are not only aestheticly pleasing, but they taste as good as they look. my personal favorite was a chocolate shake topped with a moise warm brownie and a red and white striped straw. I have to say, it was a good lookin shake. The cons of the milkshakes; The price is too high, took a very long time to make it, and finally, you think that you will be receiving this milkshake in a collectable cup, But you end up with a plastic cup with a cheap almost translucent sticker placed on the side. and for the price of the shakes, i would think universal could give back to their customers somehow. ending this review with this, if your wanting something different, dont mind high prices, and dont mind waiting, i would say this is your place. if not, I'll say this, you wont be missing out on that much."},{"name":"Parma Trattoria & Mozzarella Bar","address":"1132 W Dillon Rd","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"One of our favorite stops in Louisville Colorado near Boulder.

I read up on Yelp to try to get an idea of what the seating would be like (not wanting to stand all night). What I didn't see from previous reviews is how exactly the outdoor seating and music shows were. First, there are two stages. When you first walk up the outdoor area, directly behind the hostess stand, there is a small stage for smaller but equally entertaining acts like The Eggmen.There is a smallish cement area directly in front of that for dancing. This area backs up against a large outdoor dining patio. Off to the right of the smaller stage and a farther back away from the dining area is a second, much larger stage with a much larger cement area in front for standing/dancing to accommodate bigger acts. \\n\\nIf you want to sit at one of those outdoor tables, you have to order food, and the reviews here on Yelp for the food are not so hot. But fear not, Yelpers who do not want to order food! YOU CAN TAKE LAWN CHAIRS. Oh yes, you can!!! We arrived only about 15 minutes before The Eggmen were set to begin, and were given an hour wait for a table (which seemed unlikely as most everyone was there to see the band). I heard the hostess mention to another wait-lister that you had to order food to get a table, and we'd already eaten and only wanted a couple of beers. So I asked her if we could bring in our lawn chairs, and she said sure! We were able to set up our chairs at the edge of the small cement dance floor and had a great view and easy access to the dancing. And there was lots of dancing! We were also very close to the walk-up bar. \\n\\nWhether or not you want to sit at the outdoor dining patio, or just see the band, you had to pay a $5 cover. But The Eggmen were totally worth it. \\n\\nIf you haven't already seen The Eggmen, I highly recommend catching them at Nutty Brown, as I understand they play there regularly. It's a great band for all ages, and there's lots of room for kids to get up and dance, or to run and play over in the empty area in front of the larger stage."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Made the mistake once of getting a chocolate peanut butter brownie (SO rich)... but seriously what was I thinking?\\n\\nThis place is ALL ABOUT THE CANNOLIS!

When I first stepped in, it was way too dark. Just a thought for mornings, they should consider opening the windows and brightening up the room to give a more welcoming ambience for regular coffee-shop-goers. Anyways, they have a latte machine which I was really excited about! When I asked if she can make a tea latte with vanilla syrup, she tilt her head a little. Their was definitely a language barrier but we managed to get through it! She made me a surprisingly good tea latte! I decided to get a pastry while I was there but there were no pastry signs. I asked but due to the language barrier it didn't really help so I randomly picked one. It looked like an almond eclair so why not! It was pretty decent.

I had steak which ended up being something that had been in the freezer for 6 months, and freezer burned. My wife had a chicken special which ended up being nothing more than a frozen chicken patty with a little sauce on it.

However, the Imperial Amber was just too sweet for our liking. \\n\\nFood:\\nButler Steak & Frites - Bourbon onions, blue cheese fries, red wine redux [$19] \\n\\nWe first asked if the blue cheese fries could be substituted or made without the blue cheese since my bf did not like blue cheese. Our waitress's response seemed to imply that the chef was a bit particular about the way the dishes are made in general and so, could not honor our request, but we put in the order anyways since I could just eat all the fries. Anyway, the dish came without blue cheese and a huge surprising relief to the bf. I probably would have loved the fries either way. We weren't asked for our preferred doneness of the steak (and we forgot to mention it too), which came out to be about just medium (no sign of any pink). Normally we would find this done-ness to be a little overdone, but the tenderness and combination with the caramelized onions made this delightful the way it was.\\n\\nAncho Shrimp Burger - Cilantro corn mayo, red cabbage, pickled veggies $10 \\n\\nWe chose Curried Cauliflower Florets as the side to go with this dish. This is my first time having a shrimp burger and I was wondering why I haven't seen this in more menus b/c this was so good if you love shrimp.

When we first walked in and were asked to wait near the hostess stand until our table was ready, I noticed some stray bits of paper that a child must have left on the floor. Sadly, not a single staff member bothered to pick it up. They were busy chatting. I actually picked it up because I couldn't stand the sight of it anymore, and asked the staff to throw it away. That wasn't the best first impression, but let's move on.\\n\\nThe dining room is very small and cozy, with dim lighting and a very cavernous feel to it. Apparently, the room is divided into the different provinces of Canada. We were seated in New Brunswick. Our waiter reminded us VERY MUCH of Jonah Hill, who apparently is not Canadian (I just Googled it). This must have been his Canadian doppelganger. In case you were wondering.\\n\\nThe menu at Le Cellier has changed earlier this year to account for a single all-day menu instead of separate lunch and dinner ones. This led to a lot of criticism from fans because not only did this mean some of their favorite dishes were no longer on the menu, but also that dinnertime prices would be the norm throughout the day. We were frustrated when this change took place, but decided to suck it up because we had a reservation, had never tried Le Cellier, and it was on our list. The prices WERE pretty obnoxious for lunch, but we made a sacrifice this one time.\\n\\nThe bread selection at Le Cellier is great. My absolute favorite is the pretzel bread. I couldn't stop eating it, especially slathered with some of the maple sugar-topped butter. Wow. We shared an appetizer of Sunkist Heirloom Tomatoes with Housemade Mozzarella. It was really nice and refreshing, exactly what we needed on a hot Orlando day.\\n\\nWe both opted for steaks for our mains. My sister went with the NY Strip, which we thoroughly enjoyed. I had to get their famous Mushroom Filet. It was cooked perfectly and served with a delicious mushroom risotto and a luscious white truffle cream sauce. I ate every last bite, with no regrets of price or calories.\\n\\nFor what it's worth, I think Le Cellier is a great steakhouse. I can't see myself enjoying lunch here in the future considering the price hike, but I wouldn't be opposed to a special occasion dinner here in that price range in the future. The food was definitely good enough for a return visit when I'm craving cow."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Yummy.

Nothing to write home about, I didn't finish it and I probably wouldn't order it again. As for my parents, they both got the Reuben sandwich which was fairly large, and they both described it as \\"fairly tasty but very greasy\\". Not the best way to start a day in Disney.

The hash was made up of smoked salmon, potatoes and leeks. It was an incredibly flavorful dish. The scrambled eggs were also a really good consistency in that they weren't too runny and not completely firm. The biscuits were a really wonderful texture. They were light, fluffy and so savory. \\n\\nMy friend ordered a chai latte and did a half/half order of migas and biscuits which he also very much enjoyed. Another surprise for us was that the entire cost of our meal was $30 before tip!

He is a transplant from the San Francisco and Los Angeles food scenes.  Since childhood he has been a big fan of pollo ala brasa.  In adulthood he widened his palate to include all Peruvian food. My wife and I look for new places to eat and determine which ones are keepers. We invited our son to join us lunch at Lima Criolla .I have travelled extensively in Latin  America.  I became rabidly fond of Peruvian cuisine.  My love for Limeno food rubbed of on my wife.  We impressed by the clean functional decor of the place.  Next our waitress was very friendly and helpful without any unnecessary gushing you find so often in Austin.  I started with a maracuya pisco sour.  It was  just so excellent tasty and refreshing.  I also had a chicha morada with my meal it was quite tasty and not sugary sweet. My wife ordered  Frijol con Seco.  The beef was tender and tasted piquant and hearty.  The Canary beans were cooked to perfection and contained diced sausage.The rice was tasty and perfectly cooked.   My son had Arroz con Pollo  the chicken was moist, tender, and perfectly spiced.  The rice was almost a paella it contained so many flavoring ingredients.  I had Jalea which was a fried seafood dish with three dipping sauces.  The sauces were flavorful and carried just the right amount of heat.  The seafood was fried to perfection and did not have overpowering breading.  It was served with and escabeche containing cancha.  It was close to the best I have had.  Without a doubt we will return until we have had everything on the menu.  I encourage anyone to come here you will not be disappointed.  Peruvian food is the original fusion cuisine."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Let me preface this by saying I might be a bit biased towards Mikes.

We did not know it opens at 11am, so we were quite glad that we were the 2nd group to be let in.  We were sat down on a table next to the door when the entire restaurant was emptied.  It was poor service that we were not allowed to move to another table for the reason, \\"it is reserved.\\"  Dumbest thing I have ever heard when a restaurant is empty.  I understand if it was completely full and is busy to be sat down to the first available table, but not in that kind of scenario.  During this visit, they also messed up my friend's order.\\n\\nCattle Cafe is a great place to go for lunch. I enjoy their noodle combos since you get to choose the soup base, noodles, and toppings.

It took this woman (Subway employee) 25 minutes to make them as there was a STRONG language barrier. She had no idea what he was saying...at all. She put the wrong stuff on the wrong sandwich, but his frustration was boiling at this point so he took them anyway. He said a \\"tiny\\" bit of mayo and mustard and she poured it on thick, then asking if he wanted oil, even though she put that on first. Literally went around in circles for every simple ingredient, asking if he wanted stuff already on the sandwich.\\n\\nAnyway, to my order...a simple 6 inch oven roasted chicken took 20 minutes as this lady didn't know what I was saying. I can deal with language barriers, but how can someone be employed (I assume own in her case) by a franchise and not have a clue what pickles, onions, and cheese are? Even pointing was getting her very confused. It was bad, she needs to know the basics to serve the public.\\n\\nOverall, that was my first and probably last visit. 40 minutes to get a sub when there is no line is unacceptable and this woman (name tag was smeared off, could only see if ended with \\"...ousef\\" needs English classes, or at least learn words needed to do her job.\\n\\nHorrific experience."},{"name":"Se√±or Frog's","address":"8747 International Drive #103","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"We got free drink coupons so we decided to go in.

You had to order \\"family style\\" sides if you wanted something other than meat.  I was really intrigued by the selection of sides, and almost said \\"forget the meat, let's get one of each of the sides!\\" But my husband wouldn't hear of it.\\n\\nThe braised collard greens with smoked bacon were excellent. We finished all of them without a problem. I put a little of the mustard sauce provided on them and it made it even more delicious.\\n\\nThe waffle fries were tasty, fresh and crispy. They weren't worth $6 for a side of them, as they tasted like any other waffle fry you can get, but were still very good.\\n\\nI really wanted to like the okra with the remoulade sauce, but the way they prepared them made them a less than desirable experience. first of all, the remoulade sauce was just mayo and hot sauce. They cut the okra in half lengthwise and coated them in cornmeal and fried them. Unfortunately, this method preserved the slimy-ness of the okra, and it made them difficult to get down. Sad! \\n\\nOverall, the food was good and the portions were good. The atmosphere was decent, the waitstaff was relatively attentive, but the prices were outrageous. Almost $100 for two people to have BBQ! And I use the term \\"BBQ\\" loosely, as it was more of a steakhouse. We decided that next time we want lots of sides at a BBQ joint, we'd stick with Hoover's. \\n\\nIf you like the ambiance of the 2nd-street district and don't mind paying too much for your food, hey, go for it."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Worst experience ever.

I'm not a coleslaw girl but my husband likes it so thumbs up on that as well.  Wash it all down with perfectly brewed iced or sweet tea and you've had yourself a pretty great comfort food meal without having to travel to the South. \\n\\nAll the while you sit at shared tables so it really feels like a community dining experience.

It was a good way to chill with some friends after a wild Saturday night out. Besides pizza with a little hair of the dog always makes a great breakfast. \\n\\nI decided to check in here and see if they still had their super yummy thin crust pizza on special this weekend, and luck for me - they did! The BF and I split the four cheese and the spinach and apple pizzas, along with some deep fried pickles to start. We probably didn't need that much food, but I was craving the deep fried pickles (unfortunatley I thought the ones at Yagger's were better - mostly due to the dipping sauce) but nobody cold hold a candle to the pizzas at the Yaletown Brew Pub. The crust and dough they use for their pizzas tastes so fresh, like they just finished making it for you. It comes out of the oven all soft and chewy and has that floury-feel to the bottom of it. I think they should have dipping sauces for the crust though, cuz I love dipping sauces for my crust, but it is still good on its own.\\n\\nI also had a cesar, which was good, and the BF had a beer, they have one on special for $4.50 on Sundays, so I think that was the one he got. My only gripe about the place was that we sat on the bar side and the lighing was so dark that I could barely read the menu. I felt like a bit of an old lady turning the light app on on my iphone just so I could read the damn thing. I'm all for dark and mysterious as I'm sure you all know, but it has to be functional too!

And if you are lucky like I was, you'll get to talk shop with the owner while you wait. He was just hanging out talking with all of us about his favorite places to eat and the history behind HCT. It was on his recommendation that I order my chicken Hot. There are 4 choices, Cold, Warm, Hot and Holy. I'll try the Holy next time but as a fan of all things spicy I can tell you that the Hot is right there in the sweet spot of being spicy yet not making everything else you eat tasteless. This is very important. So I ordered the 5 Wing Meal which came with 5 Whole Wings, Ma's Mac, Ma's Slaw, Bread and Pickles. All of this for $10.50 but there is more...the Sweet Tea is complimentary!  That is a lot of value if you ask me!  The Wings were so good I could eat nothing but them for weeks. Perfectly crispy and that flavor from the Hot just sticks to your ribs. So incredibly good!  The spices get all over your hands and the bread is perfect for soaking it all up. The Mac is gooey and delicious. Then there is the Slaw which does it's job of cooling you down. Top it all off with a few Dill Pickle slices and that Sweet Tea and you have a real winning combo!  You order at the counter and give them your name then a few minutes later your order will be brought out from the kitchen and they will call your name. I was there at a peak time and it still only took about 5 minutes to have the food in my hands. You can eat there or go out to the corridor if you like or obviously take it home.

We were all so excited to go as we've lived in Atlanta for over 35 years and had always thought it looked like a lovely place to dine!  What a horrible expensive experience! First off, we were told (not escorted) around the side of the building past the service doors to a large tent. We entered the tent right beside the band combo which was playing (awkward) no one met us or told us where to sit or what to do. We proceeded to wander until we felt ok with some seating. The tables were narrow banquet tables with unironed table cloths. They had mason jars with water and a few inexpensive flowers for a centerpiece. As soon as we were all seated the band quit and packed up & left. No one came to our table to welcome us or tell us where to go or what to do or take our drink orders!  We decided to attend the buffet line. There was a wide variety of offerings but very unmanaged. Many of the trays were on there last leg and it was obvious that it had been there awhile.  When we returned to our table a waiter offered to take our drink order. When he returned with the drinks I asked where the bread was located. With a puzzled look on his face he said there was no bread on this buffet but I could get up and go inside and get some bread in there!!! Then one of the hostesses came over to us and asked us if there was an envelope on the table. There had been and my husband opened it and it was a note telling us we had to be done and \\"vacate\\" the table by 7pm or be charged! Then the piped music started playing Christmas music!!! THEN THEY CHARGED US A 21% GRATUITY!!! We were done! In an attempt to salvage this EXPENSIVE AND OVER CHARGED MEAL we walked down to enjoy the river. We never plan to return to Rays's and it was a horrible Easter meal for us. 5 people X $ 42.

Taking two things that people love, chai tea and doughnuts, and presenting them in a fun, unique way.  Making the doughnuts fun-sized offers us to try a bunch of flavors without feeling [as] guilty and getting too full!  The doughnuts were soft on the inside and had a very slight crispness on the outside.  And offering a flight of different types of in-house brewred chai teas to accompany those donuts was another great move.  The only thing I would say is that the chai teas were a little lacking in flavor for me, personally.  They each had distinctive flavors, but most of them could've used a little more sugar or sweetening.  Presentation was on point though, and they also have other options like matcha lattes, etc.  \\n\\nThere's plenty of parking around the neighborhood streets and there's usually a line that goes out the door, but I would say that the line goes pretty fast.

Looking at the reviews, there was a pit in my stomach because people were describing a rude employee working here which is why I wanted to write the review. I looked at my order history in the app and, sure enough, I ordered from here on 2/26. I hate to pile this on their employee but I'm going to speak my piece anyway. I don't even know if it's necessarily topical or appropriate at this point for me to leave this review but it still makes me mad to think about whenever I pass by this restaurant. I also hate to sound like an asshole Yelp reviewer so I apologize but the way the employee treated me was enough lessen my mood for the rest of the night because it was so odd and unjustifiable.\\n\\nLet me start with the good: \\nThe pizza was delicious. We got the Lamb Sausage Pizza and to those reading, I'd 100% recommend it if you're into lamb. The cookies we got were not my personal favorite but they were totally fine. I think on the food front, this place is pretty dang good!\\n\\nThat's about where my experience of this place stops being good though...\\n\\nSo my boyfriend and I were hungry after seeing a movie and we decided pizza sounded good. The movie was over around ~9:40, we order the food shortly thereafter for pick up at 10:15 and are on our way to pick it up. I was driving, I didn't notice my phone had rang and Blackbird left a voicemail saying the pizza would be ready a few minutes later. Cool! No problem on my end! And one more time, just for emphasis: it was totally fine (I even thought it was nice they called me to let me know). \\n\\nWe got there, parked, and seeing as the pizza was ready, my boyfriend and I both went inside to pick it up. We walk up to the front counter and tell the woman working there that we ordered a pizza for pickup. She uses this opportunity to snark-ily me that I could have called to order instead. I said something along the lines of \\"oh, okay\\" because I was a bit taken aback at how she said it. This was an easier method for me but I had no way of knowing they preferred a phone call (side note: why does this restaurant offer this service if it's such an inconvenience for customers to use it?). She brings the pizza up to the counter and again says I should have just called in a voice that made me wonder if I had slighted her somehow. I had already paid (and tipped 20% on the app--was that what was so irritating?). \\n\\nAnyway I would've just said thanks and left then, but my boyfriend gone to briefly use the bathroom so I was waiting for him at the front of the restaurant. She took the opportunity to repeat YET AGAIN that I should have just called just as rudely as the first two times. Did she think I didn't hear her? Had I genuinely pissed her off? Who knows because at this point, I just left to wait for my boyfriend in the car because she was making me upset--I hadn't even said enough to her to be able to annoy her from my perspective! I understand having a hard night and I truly am sympathetic to that but berating customers for the method they choose to order is really a bizarre thing to do. I don't know what her circumstances were and whether she was stressed about something else but I shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable while picking up a dang pizza and I did nothing wrong.\\n\\nBasically, at least one employee here hates when customers order through the Eat24 app for no discernible reason so beware of that before you decide to do so. I probably won't again."},{"name":"Peppercorns Family Restaurant","address":"279 Boston Rd","city":"North Billerica","stars":"2","text":"First time here and we weren't sure of the name as the building and signage read Peppercorns but our credit card receipt had G'seppe's on it. \\n\\nThe place was empty except for 3 other tables when we arrived at 7p for dinner.

First of all, we had to wait over a half hour past our reservation time. That is unacceptable right off the bat. I could see five minutes. But 30? Why bother to make a reservation? \\nIt only got more disappointing from that point. We were given bread, one basket for a table of 7 people. The pretzel bread was yummy, but no better than what I get at the supermarket. All sides were a la cart, and with steaks being $50+, we couldn't really bear to add much on. \\nWe thought at that price point, we would be getting steakhouse quality like we were used to in NY. Not even close. \\nOur rib eyes were wet and sloppy, with some sort of butter melted all over it. While the temperature inside was correct, the texture was all wrong. A dry aged steak like that should come out popping and sizzling, beautiful crusted on the outside while soft and juicy on the inside. The butter should come as a pat on top that slowly melts with the steak as you eat it. The steak was swimming in the already melted butter, making it more like a sloppy sauce. My husband was so turned off by it, that he started to feel queasy and had to leave. We spent the entire dinner with the waitress coming to our table, one of us obviously missing, and an entire untouched $54 steak sitting there. \\nAT NO POINT did she asked what happened or why he didn't eat his steak. Again, at that price point, someone should be repeatedly checking in to make sure we are happy with every aspect of the meal. Instead, upon handing us the bill, she merely asked if we wanted the uneaten steak wrapped up. How could a waitress see an entirely uneaten meal and an absent member of the party and never ask if  everything was ok?!!! That is insane to me. And when I then volunteered the information that we didn't wanted it wrapped bc it made him feel queasy, she simply blamed it on the hot day outside. Really??? Just horrific. \\nEven the kids' meals were lacking. My daughter asked for the kids' salmon cooked rare, and it was hard and dry. Not to mention our WAY overpriced bottle of wine, which we had to guzzle upon seeing the $500+ bill. There were 7 of us, so if we had an amazing meal, then fine.

Rockmill Tavern took over what once was World of Beer in the Brewery District. You'd think that since I had my 21st birthday celebrations at that same World of Beer location, I'd be slightly sad and overly nostalgic that Rockmill took over. However, that would be wrong. Good riddance. Rockmill Tavern is far more worthy of the space and earnestly the world is a better place because of it.\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\nIn transparency, I heard several good things about this place from friends before giving it a try and in result leveled my expectations to be slightly disappointed. However, it totally delivered (x2) and I learned that I still need to work on some of my trust issues.\\n- I've been for both Brunch & Dinner. In my experience, most restaurants have more flavorful appetizers than actual main dishes. That's not the case here, everything is great (including the desserts)\\n- Typically this is the point where I state what I've had and what I would suggest to eat. However, I'll stick to my guns that there simply isn't a bad choice. If I must, go with the Chicken Sandwich since it simply can't be matched in Columbus\\n\\nATMOSPHERE/SERVICE\\n- The servers are all knowledgeable about their product, and you can tell that they are given the opportunity to taste everything on the menu. I've asked each time I've went for the servers suggestion and it has yet to fail me\\n- Rockmill is slightly dark/intimate but in a weird hybrid of industrial/barn sort of way. Don't get me wrong, I love everything about it. The music is a little louder than at other restaurants, but I personally enjoy that.\\n\\nPARTING WORDS\\nEven if you've only read 1/3 of this novella, I hope my sentiment was clear. Treat yourself to a Saison, and make sure to go to Rockmill Tavern at least once. You deserve it."},{"name":"3 Country Bistro","address":"379 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"I always go here if I want some good sushi.\\nThe place is a bit small, but it has a cozy feeling to it.\\nThe sushi is wonderful here and is very well presented.

I don't like kale THAT much.  The meat in potstickers was stringy, although tasty. Dipping sauce would have made it better.  The pork ribs were quite flavorful, but cut just small enough that - since I cannot manage chopsticks I was required to pick up the tiny morsels in my fingers because it was impossible to use a fork and knife on them. No extra napkins, only the one on my lap.  Hands-down the best item was the french fries: crispy, salty and a strong potato chip like flavor. My husband also thought the fish was decent.

The store itself is bigger, with more people helping serve the incredible amount of customers that come through their doors every day. The cannoli itself is bigger, but about a dollar more expensive than Modern's; however, I feel that this is a good trade off. One cannoli is the perfect size for me to share with a friend.

That may sound like a lofty statement, but hear me out first.\\n\\nIt's a small, mom & pop type establishment.  The entire staff, from chef to cashier, greet you when you enter and say goodbye when you leave.  You can often see one of their staff (even the chef) handing out flyers and drumming up business on the streets of downtown.  They're trying to bring their unique flavor into an otherwise bland part of Atlanta.  Immigrant business owners with a ridiculous work ethic... I can't think of anything more American than that.\\n\\nIt also helps that their food is top notch.  The wraps have continuously blow me away with the savory bulgogi beef sporting a touch of Japanese by mixing in delicious slices of ginger.  You also get miso soup, ginger salad and a couple of california rolls in this combo.  A ton of damn good food for a reasonable price.\\n\\nThe place is small, but every time I go back they've tried something else to make it more comfortable even replacing the tables for a better seating arrangement.  Whenever I've bumped into any of the staff on the street they say hello and ask how I'm doing .  When I go into their restaurant they know what I usually order.  They don't want to be a food factory turning out cheap fare, they want to be the local place where you're a regular and love coming back.\\n\\nFor as long as I'm in Atlanta I'll be coming back to this restaurant and supporting them.

I think my biggest disappointment were their soup dumplings - its usually a staple for me, but I found it to be mostly dry and bland and a little too gingery.\\n\\nIn terms of the VALUE, however, it is hands down 5 stars. Each small dish is around $4, medium dish $5, and large dish around $6. I came here with three others (the four of us), and we ate to our fill for only $40, including tip. That is truly an amazing value.\\n\\nAs service goes, its a little harder if you don't know a ton of Chinese, but everyone was generally friendly and willing to listen through my broken Mandarin. I definitely ordered a couple of things incorrectly (what can you do!) but I overall enjoyed my experience at Ming's and will definitely come here again. \\n\\nOne thing I will say - parking is a HUGE pain.

We opted to get it all in one big pan with the Louisiana sauce (mild).  The food looked and smelled amazing.  The Louisiana sauce was pretty spicy even for it being mild but it was bomb. The king crab was definitely my fave part.

Maya is definitely set up for success, with a menu that appeals to all tastes. \\n\\nThe space has been renovated beautifully, with warm, inviting decor. We tried a couple of Maya's specialty cocktails - the kachumber cooler, refreshing with cucumber and bits of green chili; and the Bengal Tiger, bright and flavorful with ginger and pineapple. \\n\\nFor food, we started with the Gobi Manchurian app. It arrived as requested, drier style, and packed a ton of flavor and some nice heat. Indo-Chinese dishes generally start at quite-hot and go up to nuclear-hot - this was at the milder end of that range. \\n\\nFor entrees, we had vegetable biryani and a Rajasthan-style curry with paneer. The biryani was gloriously fragrant and flavorful. The paneer was excellent, soft and tasty. There were just a couple of small issues: Our spice-level requests got mixed up - my biryani was quite hot, while my companion's curry was very mild. We're both fine with spicy though, so we simply shared and I added extra raita to my biryani. The other small issue was that the raita was tasty but very thin - I would prefer it thicker. Again, a small issue.\\n\\nService was superb! Prompt, friendly, and welcoming. The manager came to greet us and when he found out we're big Indian food fans, we had a nice conversation and he made us each a complimentary off-menu Jal Jeera margarita! (WOW. Americans, you have got to get into jal jeera so that they add this drink to the menu. Black salt can be a little difficult for some people at first - the smell is a bit like sulfur, but the tangy flavor is unbeatable. I could drink a lot of these.) Even nicer, we were given a complimentary dessert of pista kulfi to end the meal. We left super full, with enough leftovers for lunch. \\n\\nOverall, the impression we got is one of a thoughtful restaurant, with staff and management who put time and care into presentation and customer service. We'll certainly be back!"},{"name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"1489 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"These are the best subs!  The philly is my favorite.

Normally at restaurants big groups are put into corners, but nope, not this one. we were put in the middle of the restaurant, with the table extending horizontally across the restaurant, pretty much blocking off the passage way for other customers go to the washroom and servers to serve food.\\n\\nBecause we were so closely situated near the other side of the wall, and with customers squeezing by, one of those foldable fence/boards (that were folded up, and just resting against the wall) fell against my back. The board was 6 ft or something and made out of at least 3 wooden panels - it was really heavy and painful. I understand that accidents happen, but their reaction to this was such horrible service. The manager came by, picked up the board, and asked if I was ok. I told him no, I'm not, I'm actually in a lot of pain - and he 'sympathizes' (pretty much by telling me, wow that sucks that you're in pain, but it's not my fault), and it was left unaddressed for all of dinner. The board was actually placed back into the same place against the wall again. What the heck?\\n\\nI was left feeling pissed and sore throughout dinner. And during this time the server and multiple bussers that came by gave us the wrong food, too many orders of one food. This would be great if they didn't charge us for making too many orders of one food, when we hadn't ordered it. I wouldn't have paid for it, but my friend picked up the remaining tab. They also would not remember who had what - which was problematic when there were so many side dishes that came along, that some people didn't get their side dishes. \\n\\nSo at the end of dinner, still sore, I speak to the manager. What I said was that falling boards in a restaurant hitting customers is highly unexpected and unprofessional, and that I felt that I deserved some sort of an apology - aka a discount on my meal. \\n\\nThe manager was so rude. He asked me repeatedly \\"Are you hurt? Are you hurt?\\" but in a condescending way. After I implied I wanted a discount on my meal - he actually said \\"If you are injured, you can go to a DOCTOR, or a PHYSIOTHERAPIST. If there are bills for your recovery, then we can talk.\\" \\n\\nI was pissed. After articulating exactly what I want rather than implying (that I want a discount on my meal) and why I should be compensated (because I am still in pain from a falling board because of their irresponsibility - I'll recover, but is that anyway to be treated in a restaurant?), I get a measly 15% discount on my meal, because he told me, that's the max that he can give me as a manager.\\n\\nOkay well, I understand, most places have stuff like that, a discount cap. I used to have that too, working in a restaurant. \\n\\nLater, I find out he is the owner of the restaurant, not the manager.\\n\\nWooooooooooooooooow. \\n\\nWill never ever come back, and hope nobody else comes here too."},{"name":"Blue Dragon","address":"324 A St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Generally, Blue Dragon doesn't take reservations.  However, I wish I knew that Blue Dragon does take reservations for Restaurant Week (or, officially Dine Out Boston), as that would have saved us from standing around waiting for a table.\\n\\nMy Blue Dragon experience summarized in two short words: noisy, salty.\\n\\nThe space was an open bar scene with tables set along the outer wall, with nothing to muffle the chatter.  Even so, I spied two tables with toddlers and babies and one middle table with an elementary school aged kid.  The kids were fine.  Even when the baby cried, he didn't make much of a noise in contrast to the rest of the room.\\n\\nAs we were here for Restaurant Week, we were presented with a menu listing a selection of their normal offerings, and for $38 apiece, we were each able to select 1 Snack, 3 Tapas, and enjoy a Cookie Dessert.  We ordered everything to share, so the dishes came as they were prepared.\\n\\n. Japanese Sweet Potato Chips with Charred Scallion and Meat Jus Dip $5 (Snack)\\nNicely crisp with evident sweet potato flavor, tasty sauce\\n. Soy Pickled Deviled Egg with Taro Nest $3 (Snack)\\nThe deviled egg yolk was way too salty\\n\\n. Sake Cured Foie Gras Torchon, Cold Somen Noodles with Verrill Farms Veggies and white peaches $13 (Special's Board)\\nThe Foie Gras itself was sadly too salty; we informed the server of this so that he could at least let the kitchen know so that the dish could hopefully be improved upon for the next party to order it\\n. Carolina BBQ Potstickers $10 (Tapas)\\nStuffed full of meat, sauces served on the side as requested, didn't taste particularly good\\n. Beer-Battered Fish Tacos $13 (Tapas)\\nBurnt grill marks were unappetizing to the eyes first, the nose second, and to the tongue third.  QC should have taken greater care.  The fish itself was fine.\\n. Garlic-Chile Braised Octopus $13 (Tapas)\\nBest part were the terrific crisp little balls of... potato?  Octopus and veggies were fine as well.\\n. Garlic-Sake Clams with Udon Noodles $14 (Tapas)\\nOnly 3 clam shells were perched on top.  The noodles weren't exactly udon, nor were they al dente.  But they were rather oily as a whole.\\n. 3 Piece Buttermilk Tempura Chicken with Sweet Chili Sauce and \\"Slawce\\"  (Tapas) ($29 for a whole chicken)\\nCrisp coating on the skin protecting moist flesh.  This was good.\\n\\n. The Cookie (Dessert)\\nDeep Dish Chocolate Chip Cookie Served Warm and Topped with Ice Cream and Soy Caramel Sauce\\nOn their regular menu, this is $14, so my guess is that's for the larger cookie, not the personal sized ones we opted for - they tend to offer parties of 2 or more ordering RW to have the larger cookie instead, which I'm now sure would have been more cookie.  But still the warm soft cookie with melting ice cream was quite good and filling, so leave room for it!\\n\\nService was a bit mixed.  One fella took our order, but generally our plates were brought out nilly willy by other staffers, who might move over a dish on the table to make room for the new addition, but made no effort at clearing any of the now emptied ones.  And their tables for two aren't all that large, so it got a bit awkward placing everything.\\n\\nFor weeknights, they validate for those parking at the nearby Necco Garage Street Garage as long as you park after 5pm and pick up a validation coupon at the Blue Dragon host stand.  So it's $5 vs the $10 Sleepover Rate, or their hourly rate which starts at $7 for 0 min to 1/2 hour.

Although I truly miss the pork gyoza, i'm willing to jump onboard with the new mexican cuisine and our food was fresh, fast and tasty.

KEEP it that way! The LAST thing I want to know while i'm settling a $80+ bill is that i'm about to get hit with an annoying $2.50 service charge so the restaurant can make some extra coin. Awkward times.\\n\\nThe second time around, I went knowingly with cash in hand and after finishing our drinks and a fine round of appies, asked for our bill. We were in no rush but the place wasn't busy so after 15 minutes of waiting, we raised our eyebrows a little; at 25 minutes it became a little comical; at 30 minutes, we received our bill (hurrah!) only to wait another 15 for change.

She kept my drinks refilled, maintained a good demeanor and we had a lovely chat with her afterwards that kinda made me adore her.

The mushroom pizza though good...tasted nothing like a mushroom pizza. It had goat cheese, balsamic glaze, and caramelized onions on it which though good, completely overpowered the mushrooms so we tasted everything BUT the mushrooms on the pizza...which is a bummer considering you know...it was a mushroom pizza.\\n\\nThe carbonara pasta was pretty good though I found the portion to be on the small side.

Mind you this order was to be split up between two people, so if you go make sure to order a large Mac N' Cheese (I got a small, and I didn't share), I think the Banana Pudding was a good enough size after the sandwich to be split by two. These sandwiches are quite large in my opinion, I saved half for dinner (that was a tough decision).\\n\\nDriving back to the office, I couldn't help but dip in to just a slice of the brisket, it had a maple brown sugar coating that was to die for, and it didn't even need any sauce. When I was able to sit down, I actually dug in to the Banana Pudding first, and it was awesome! It has some good flavor, real bananas, a little crust, and whip cream swirl through out. Yum. Then the Mac N' Cheese, it's the REAL stuff, ooey gooey, thick macaroni noodles, some bread crumbs, I saved half for dinner, but it beats my moms stuff any day of the week.\\n\\nNow then, the Beef Brisket Sandwich needs it's own transitional phrase and paragraph. It's on sesame seed hoagie sandwich bread, slightly toasted. The brisket itself is cooked to perfection, it didn't fall apart, it wasn't too burnt, it wasn't dry, and it had a good flavor to it. Honestly, I started to just take the slices of brisket off the bread and dip it in the sauce. Their sauce is good, the house sweet sauce is comparable to a lot of other places honestly, but where they really hit a homerun is on the Habanero Hot BBQ Sauce.

These are vastly better than the old ones, probably competitive with Vera's (as much as most Vancouverites would loath to admit).  The wings end up nothing to write home about, but adequate; worth it on Wednesdays.\\n\\nThe thing that really earned them a full extra star was the recent introduction of a few microbrews.

I see some of the reviews complaining about the price but I thought the price was average 12-15 for a drink and no more than 15 for a 8 piece roll of sushi....very normal to me, esp for dining in buckhead. I made reservations and still had to wait a hour which i think defeats the purpose if im waiting with everyone else . tables were empty but no bust boy to take care of the table the hostess was NEVER at her post( probably because she was taking orders and bringing in plates) she popped in about every 20 min to tell people how long the wait would be...but never took and names and did not keep up with who was nxt to be seated me and my husband eventually seated ourselves at a dirty table and asked one of the employees to clean it after we sat there for a while. The bar is made of ice but...its not a focal point which i think it should be b/c....duhh the name!  its covered by plates and menus and place settings so you cant even see it, another thing is its a very small place so while your waiting to be seated youre just in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by eating people in a cramped space standing awkardly in the middle with nothing to do or look at..but the ceiling which it pretty neat. someone can just walk in and steal a seat at the bar, order for them and all their friends while youve been waiting an hour ( happened to us) apparenly the bar area, which is really the best seat in the house is \\"open\\" and if a seat becomes available its just open to anyone who walks in it which is stupid considering how small the place is and every seat is valuable esp such nice seating as the bar. once we were seated we got our food and drinks quickly and our server was nice but wouldnt bring me water when i asked 3 times??? the place is nice really cool but understaffed they need help with organization and seating id go again but not for the night scence. unless i hear they get their ish together in those ares"},{"name":"The Diamond","address":"6 Powell Street, 2nd Floor","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Given our limited time in Vancouver, I wanted to make the most of it by visiting a fantastic craft cocktail bar pre-dinner: The Diamond seemed like the ticket.\\n\\nAlthough worried it would be too packed around 7 on a Friday night, we ascended the creaky staircase from the nondescript entry on Powell and were seated right away by a window with the view of the old street lamp on the corner below.

Plump, in a savory broth, they disappeared quickly!

Have not yet been for an actual dinner so can't speak on that.\\n\\nUpon arriving during happy hour, both hostesses seemed to be quite unorganized and a bit flustered, first telling us they had a table for us, then telling us it was reserved for someone else, and then finally asking us if we wanted to sit at the outside bar stools (which logically should have been immediately offered as an option when we said we were there solely for happy hour / drinks.) \\n\\nThe happy hour itself had pretty decent options and prices. Everything was flavorful and great for sharing if you order a few of the plates. Margaritas were pretty good too, balanced in flavor. My only \\"meh\\" feeling about happy hour was that there wasn't enough fresh / veggie options, and it was mostly heavy, carb-filled stuff. \\n\\nThe brunch seemed to still be in \\"test mode,\\" but my friend and myself both REALLY enjoyed what we ordered. I had the pi√±on pancakes and she had the ceviche tostada, I believe. The tostada was OUTSTANDING! My pancakes were good but I think I've had better in New Mexico.\\n\\nThe breakfast burritos have been my least favorite of everything. I usually order the vegetarian and it has consistently been so spicy that my lips will be on fire for at least 10 minutes AFTER I finished the burrito. Really wish they would take it down a notch with the spice, it's a bit unnecessary and the last thing I want to start my day is heartburn. It was also messy as hell and NOT appropriate as a grab-and-go meal.

A perfect place to listen to some music, grab a drink or two and enjoy a slice of your favorite pizza.\\n\\nEverything is farm to table- which I love! There is something about knowing where your ingredients are coming from that make it just all that much better when digging into your fav pizza. I went with a group of friends and we each ordered our own. The waitress advised us this would be a lot of pizza but actually it worked out quite nice. The pizzas are not that big, I would say they are a bit larger than CPK pizzas and if you have a few extra slices to take home, all the better. Leftover pizza is the best! \\n\\nI had the gluten free fig, prosciutto and arugula and my boyfriend had the gluten free pepperoni. This is by far one of the best gluten free crusts I have ever had. Often time gluten free crust can be mealy or fall apart as soon as you touch it, but this crust is crispy and delicious! I actually preferred it to the normal crust. The combination of goat cheese, fig and prosciutto was amazing. I added some crushed red peppers to give it the kick it needed. The pepperoni was so flavorful. You could really taste the difference between this pepperoni and pepperoni from Pizza Hut or Dominos. \\n\\nThe waitress we had was amazing.

While the shrimp and the tomato/polenta was really tasty, the sauce was really flavorless.  We then got the special pasta which was a fettuccini with peas and proscuitto.  Ths pasta was thick and perfectly al dente, the peas were slightly undercooked which made them crunchy (which I didn't mind but my husband thought they needed a little more cook time) and the proscuitto was cut into long strips which made it hard to eat.  Proscuitto is a bit salty so eating a long string of it was a bit much.  For our entree, we got the sea scallops which came over a bed of couscous and some julienned squash and zucchini.  Again, the seafood was wonderful but the sauce was flavorless!  We figured out that there was no garlic in these dishes at all!  We wondered if the restaurant had forgotten to buy garlic that day!\\n\\nDessert was a disappointment.  My husband ordered the special blueberry pie which he said needed more sugar, to balance the tart.  And my chocolate gelato first came as soup, it was all melted and they expected me to eat that?  When they brought out another batch, I took one bite and stopped eating it.  That was NOT gelato!  Gelato is rich and thick and creamy deliciousness and this was icy and not creamy at all!

I don't know why I consistently do this to myself, because it seems that no one outside of the state of Texas can properly smoke beef brisket, but still, I seek out even subpar brisket. I saw the brisket mentioned in a lot of Yelp reviews & thought I should try it.  This brisket was \\"ok.\\"  It still retained quite a bit of juice (although I think they *might* be soaking it in the back, pre-sliced, instead of sliced when ordered...). I think this would have been a \\"good'ish\\" brisket, if it had some bark on it.  Where is the bark? My sandwich had one little tiny sliver on it...highly disappointing (& goes to support my soaking theory).  The bun was a seeded hoagie roll, and I wish it had been something a bit more elevated than that...it should have been toasted on the inside at least.  I got the sweet BBQ sauce on the side, and I liked that even their sweet sauce has some heat to it.  The cheesy potatoes are more of an au gratin style, instead of hashbrown style, in case anyone was curious.  I'm not normally a huge cheesy potato fan, but I liked these a lot.  It tasted like they maybe mixed some dry rub seasoning into the potatoes?  Whatever it was, I liked it.  \\n\\nOverall, this might be good for Columbus Ohio BBQ, but I was a bit disappointed for the BBQ quality in general.

How is the super crunchee not be crunchy  therefore I complained about it and got another roll of sushi but still was not good. The men's restroom was also disgusting.

The service is really good, the restaurant interior is beautiful, yet classic. It's clean, comfy, and unexpectedly well designed for a BBQ spot. The bartender is a man among men, with a beard of a champion and super skilled cocktail-making expertise. Definitely had a man crush on the bartender... he was freakin' awesome.\\n\\nNow, the food isn't bad either! We tried the brisket and pork ribs for meat, with mac 'n' cheese, collared greens, jicama slaw, and baked beans for sides. Everything was amazingly delicious! The brisket was as good as any brisket that I've tried in Austin, absolutely melting in your mouth. It had a hint of coffee and was perfectly seasoned and smoked to taste. The pork ribs were pretty good--kind of unimpressive in terms of portion and meat content though. Next time I'd pass on the pork ribs. All four of the sides we got were amazing, with highlights on the mac 'n' cheese.

It had 4 beautiful buffets loaded with a bounty of hot tasty seafood and the Desert bar to die for. High class. This new location THE HIJACKED FRANCHISE I brought my family to on Sunday? I was appalled. The tables were sticky floor was a mess first indication to run. It had a single buffet everything was from frozen baggies it had rectangle fish sticks? Com Mon man!  And triangle so called crab cakes? Everything was over cooked some items cold. Things you find at a Duffs, The oysters were nasty. The waiter was kind enough to bring us some lobster bisque from the kitchen had a strange orange look pretty bad we thought we were eating baby's back end not sure. Crab legs were pieces soggy typical buffet style but not very good. The Lobster was abundant little soggy not bad, not worth it. The only Scallops on the bar was next to the Crab, they were in a thick pasty white sauce not yet identified cooked to high heaven. The desert bar had 5 pre made items like small 1 inch square Items like Walmart pecan pie, Brownie and Marshmallow rice crispy? Co Mon man after $50 bucks for one dinner?????? I spent $140 bucks for 3 we complained to a manager he knocked one price off so I ended up paying in a not so happy way $95 bucks plus tip. My tip? don't go back. The special order French fries were even cold. Service slow. Save your money and go to golden corral or a Chinese buffet for $12 bucks the food will be better trust me.

I started with an appetizer of curry puffs - 3 half moon deep fried bites of chicken, potato, onion and curry.  There was some wonderful flavoring in these.  Lightly sweet and a perfect balance of crispy dough outside and soft but not mushy filling inside.

Read a bunch of reviews before going but most of them were for dim sum. Lot's of Chinese restaurant have a different chef for the dim sum, so it is not an accurate representation of the food. Also there wasn't a crazy line up so I didn't experience some of the un-pleasantries written about in other reviews.\\n\\nActually I was dreading a little bit of the poor service, but I was totally surprised. We got seated right away. Everyone was very polite. No attitude. No snobbiness and very responsive. The food came very quickly. The waiters came by to pick up the dirty dishes efficiently but unobtrusively. In some restaurants, the waiters pretend to not see you so they don't have to work. But here, a quick glance was all I need for my water to be  refilled and for the cashier to bring over the credit card machine. Very good service.\\n\\nNow for the food. There were only two of us, and ordering 3 dishes was plenty.\\n\\n The shredded tender beef with assorted spicy peppers. $19.80. The beef came in more like chunks and the peppers were not spicy, but it was very tasty. Most of the beef were very tender except for a few chewy pieces, but it tasted so good, I am willing to let that slide.\\n\\n Fried Scallops with truffle sauce and mushrooms. $26.80. $26 bucks for a scallop dish is not cheap, but the scallops were humungous. And once again it tasted quite good.\\n\\n\\n Braised sea cucumber with seafood. $36.80. Again very tasty. The sea cucumber, shrimp and scallops were first class. I feel there could have been a little more sea cucumber, but they were probably the best tasting sea cucumber I have had in Vancouver. Hui Fu House has a mix seafood hot pot which is a couple of bucks more which is very similar but you get abalone as well; however, I would say the one at Peninsula tasted a little better.\\n\\nOverall Peninsula's food is top notch, but so is the price. But I feel it is worth it. The ingredients are of higher quality and very well prepared. The service was top notch as well.

First off, I am obsessed with the layout and decor of the place--the whole restaurant was clean and well-appointed, and the old-time western movie being projected onto a side wall was a nice touch. \\n\\nThe staff, from the hostess, to the guy who brought our waters, to our waitress, Evie (sp?) was incredible. Everyone was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. I even observed servers at other tables interacting with children and greeting them by name. Evie was the best--she mixed the perfect amount of small talk with a thorough knowledge of the menu, and she really tried to tailor the experience to us. \\n\\nMy roommate and I wound up eating in courses. After digging in to the complimentary chips and house-made salsas, we shared an order of guacamole with these awesome fried tortillas. At the same time, we also split one hot cake as an appetizer (one guy said they were the best pancakes in town...it did not beat out Home Grown's pancake in my opinion, but it was still very good, and served with this great buttermilk syrup). For the next course, my roommate got tortilla soup and I got pozole (which was chock full of pork, hominy, and chunks of avocado). Finally, I got the barbacoa tacos (which come 3 to a plate). Everything was fresh, and the portions were very generous. The beans that came to the table family style were hearty, flavorful, and covered with a layer of cheese that was melted over them before arriving at the table. After my tacos arrived, I realized I had forgotten to ask for them on the house made flour tortillas (at the recommendation of our server), and Evie was kind enough to bring 3 hot and fresh ones out for me to dip into the salsa--I would come here just for those tortillas!\\n\\nOnce we split the check, the totals came to just under $30 each--definitely not something I would do everyday, but also not as expensive as I expected.

It really was! It was perfection. Although in Nashville the HC finishing glaze is hot chicken oil, chili pepper and brown sugar--which is out of control good-- HCT's chicken is just as good without anything. It doesn't need it. The chicken breast I had was crispy, juicy, and had the perfect amount of heat. I like a bit of sweet to go with the salt, so I got the waffles and warm syrup to go with it. The waffle was good, but not great. The husband got the mac & cheese and the slaw--which WAS great. I keep sneaking bites. Also, HCT offers a delicious ranch dressing and free sweet tea that could easily be addictive- and i'm in no way a sweet tea lover. It was just so good. Maybe i was just in love with the chicken so much that everything seemed better? Anyway...we'll be back. Sooner rather than later, I hope!

They should try to wipe the menu down before they hand it to their customers.  \\n\\nNow, i'm not sure if i'm being too hard on them, but the first thing we ordered was soda and apparently they had none because their machine broke down.  I would think they could have ran around the corner to QFC and bought a few cases of soda to compensate for this, but they did not.  \\n\\nOur server when she was around was fairly nice.  We ordered the hummus and it came out, but we sat there for about 10 minutes before we waved our server down that we would like some bread to go with our hummus.

The freekah was overly seasoned with cinnamon and the portion to rice vs. chicken was very lacking.  The Chicken Meshwi was overly spiced and the sauce on the side (cremed garlic and lemon) was not needed due to the overkill of the seasoning.  \\n\\nNow, I have several friends that are Lebanese and based on what i've eaten at their homes I do not think it is truely as authentic as it could be, even though the sign outside reads \\"authentic lebanese cuisine.\\"   I did like their hummus and their bread was pretty good, due to it being extremely fresh.  \\n\\nIn my opinion, i rather go to Ya Hala, where the food taste more authentic even though the wait could be long.

But I've found after margarita or two while enjoying the view, I can get over the mediocre food.\\n\\nTip: skip the valet and park it yourself in the new covered garage; it's just a short walk on over to the Oasis."},{"name":"Croissant Gourmet","address":"120 E Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Stopped by here today for a sweet pick-me-up, and I was not disappointed! As stated in my previous review, my husband LOVES the chocolate croissants, but I have yet to find my go-to dessert here. Today we selected the croissant with almond cream and chocolate chips--which my husband found ever better than the chocolate croissant. Since there were no macaroons, I tried the mini strawberry tart based on a recommendation from my friend. It was difficult to eat (with the strawberries whole and pointed upwards, they are not really bite sized), but a very refreshing bite.

The sandwiches were bland and needed salt and pepper. I think a French cafe would pride itself on its eggs, but I was wrong. In addition, the french bread tasted like it was from Publix. \\nWe also ordered a napoleon and an apple strudel. They were not very fresh and were very extremely cold.

I find a 3:1 mascarpone/ricotta blend makes for a far superior cannoli filling, especially if you want to sprinkle it with pistachios or have a great compliment to a superb, bitter dark chocolate on the tips.\\n\\nThe shell was crunchy and thick, and had a good taste, but didn't seem as fresh as all that; I wonder if they start prepping too far in advance now to accommodate the business that rolls in, especially on the weekends, which is when we went. The thickness did mean the cannoli fared well on the trip home without getting mushy, but for me, the shell is just a delivery mechanism for the filling and should not take center stage."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Not sure what the fuss is all about.

I am sure that they would have accommodated my request to lower down the temp, but I didn't asked as I was busy eating delicious food. Btw, order Kingfisher beer. It is a must and you will add it to your list of foreign beers, like red stripe and others. \\n\\nI will be going there in couple of days.

I had the brisket and the mac & cheese. The brisket was as good as I've had anywhere, so no problem there. The mac & cheese, which I ordered on the strength of the yelp reviews, had a distinctly ... Velveeta character. Maybe that's what folks around here dig on, but for a spot like this I was expecting something a bit lower on the chemical additive index. The draft beer selection was okay, but they were out of a number of their local brews and those that remained were fairly similar. To be fair, the other stuff on the menu looked pretty good. Folks around me got the quail and the ribs; those looked tasty.

The service here is terrible, and I'm not quite sure if it's the server or the restaurant to blame. They had about 5 servers staffed for well over 50 people. However, the menu advertises a choice between pasta salad or kettle chips, my waiter just brought kettle chips without asking, and they were unusually hard, even for kettle chips. The food came out quickly, but everything else took forever. I ended up getting my own condiments because the service was incredibly slow. By the time he brought out my refill, I was ready for the check. It took another 10 mins to process the check. \\n\\nThe cherry on top was when my wife was eating and discovered that a cockroach had crawled up on the table and was joining us for dinner. \\n\\nFood isn't bad though, just everything with it.

Places near Woburn seemed to be lower quality, with equal or greater prices to those I was used to paying.  Enter 3 Country Bistro, a place my friend and I accidentally discovered while returning from a ski trip that left us exhausted and starving.  We crawled in from the cold and had a really pleasant surprise when we discovered this somewhat hidden gem.\\n\\nSince the first time, I have had consistently good experiences here with both eat in and take out meals.  The staff is generally friendly and professional (especially the sushi chef, who makes little shapes---like birds and even a lobster---out of radishes and serves them with items like white melon as a complimentary dessert).  The atmosphere is better than a hole in the wall sushi place, but still very low key, which they make up for with their imaginative dishes.  Parking is available in a big lot behind the strip (just don't park in the spots reserved for the bowlers trying to go to the bowling alley out back, they look like a tough crowd).\\n\\nAs to the most important part: their korean food is good by reputation, and the bi bim bab, which my dad enjoyed the last time I went there, tasted authentic and provided enough food for an adequate dinner.  Their thai food is also consistently good.  I am a fan of the pad thai, particularly the spicy one.  I will say that if you cannot handle some heat, it would be best to order the regular pad thai, as this place generally does not wuss out on the spice scale.\\n\\nThe sushi is consistently fresh.  I almost always order the same three things: the spicy scallop roll, the spicy tuna, and the asharhi cucumber roll (which is on the appetizer list).  The first two are solid choices for their freshness and spiciness, but the asharhi cucumber roll is the real find.  It nearly melts in your mouth, with fresh pieces of fish and a light ponzu sauce, which almost tastes sesame flavored.  I've tried other rolls as well, and I can say that while these three have been my favorite, I was never disappointed after branching out.\\n\\nIn general, I don't think you can beat the place when comparing it to other asian restaurants in the area, and I think it would be a strong competitor for many of the best places in the Cambridge area and Boston.  Definitely worth a shot!"},{"name":"The Rolling Rooster","address":"13717 Mopac Service Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So my friend took us here when we visited her in Austin.

Checked online to make sure it was open - both yelp and their own website say opens at 11am Saturdays.  Drove 30 minutes to eat here, and the door sign says opens at 12pm. Surely the website is more up to date than the door right, since the website takes all of 3 seconds to update?  We tried the door and stood there a few seconds, and an employee came out and snapped \\"we open at noon!\\".  Ok lady, sorry to bother you.  \\n\\nI can understand if yelp had it wrong but I confirmed on their own website that it was open at 11.  Unacceptable, putting the value of their own time ahead of their customers..  We went to nearby Del Dios instead, which was excellent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUpdate, Second Attempt:  \\n\\nWent back to Bruno's for dinner a month after the first attempt.  The pizza is good.  Not great, not the best I've ever had or the best I've had in the area, there are a handful of places I can think of that are as good or better (Prato, Wine Barn, Del Dios, Boardwalk, Antonella's, Rome's Flavours) but it was solidly good.  The service sucked.  The server was incompetent and extremely slow - garlic knots ordered as soon as we sat down came out after the pizza, service was slow throughout and the place was not crowded (maybe half full).  Interesting note, employees park in front, like right in the prime spots in front of the door where most properly managed restaurants would not allow employees to park,  We were told this is because their cars were getting broken into in back which is not surprising to me given the location.  The restaurant isn't terribly clean, I guess that makes sense as they are trying very hard to convey an \\"Indie\\" vibe and apparently are unaware that can be accomplished without sacrificing cleanliness or service, although making the customers park in back and risk theft as a result gets them some serious cred here.\\n\\nI did notice that after several months of having the incorrect hours posted on the website, they did finally correct this including an Instagram post with the correct hours and the caption \\"JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR\\" in all caps, I guess implying customers should have already known that cause hey who uses websites for information these days.  So Bruno's mgmt, if you are reading this, THANK YOU SO MUCH for going above and beyond by putting the correct hours of operation on your website.\\n\\nIn summary:  Good pizza but certainly not better than can be had elsewhere in Orlando; terrible location; slow, incompetent, and condescending customer service; not very clean.  I am upgrading my review from 1-star to 2 after actually eating here, and consider that generous."},{"name":"Thai Curry","address":"4259 SE 182nd Ave","city":"Gresham","stars":"3.5","text":"Worst salad rolls ever.

Food is still mediocre at best, service is fine and the view is still good... but not good enough to make up for constantly swatting at yourself, hoping to get those blood-sucking gnats you can't see. \\n\\n\\nI've come to The Oasis restaurant about 4 times now and the story is almost always the same - come for the view but deal with the mediocre food. We had fajitas this time and they were a little tough and wanting of a little more seasoning. The chips and salsa were good. Someone got a fried shrimp app that was very tasty, actually. The view of Lake Travis is phenomenal right now with all the rains filling up the lake (imagine seeing ugly dirt islands in the middle of the lake when the water level is low). \\n\\nBut what people really need to know is that our meal out on the balcony felt horrible today. There was a constant barrage of \\"No-see-ums\\" (aka biting midges, sandfly/sandfleas) hitting everybody at our table and all nearby tables. We could see everybody scratching and swatting at themselves. The word \\"swarm\\" would not be an understatement with how it felt to be outside today. You can't see them on you, but we managed to see some that got stuck on the white cups (see pic). The staff informed us of what they were and insisted there was nothing they could do for us other than to keep the fans on. Their gift shop offers homeopathic style (herb oils, non-DEET) insect repellant, but it did not work for us. I had a 15% DEET spray but even that didn't completely fix the nuisance. I don't know what the answer is, but they need to find a better way to combat the infestation before leaving customers outside to be bitten by bugs that are blood-sucking, and can often harbor numerous disease-causing viruses/microbes (much like mosquitoes). The staff insisted they can't spray for these because of their proximity to the lake. I'm skeptical but I'll take their word for it until I hear otherwise. More info for the curious - \\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratopogonidae\\n\\nI hate mosquitoes. These Noseeums are worse than mosquitoes, more aggressive and incessant.

I have worked in the service industry for years and I am going out to dinner for the experience. Lets just say that for a restaurant of this caliber I was very disappointed.  My fiancee ordered the chopped salad. She asked for no bell peppers on her salad. The first time it came out with bell peppers. She asked for the salad to be remade. The remade salad came out with bell peppers again. This time she let the manager know she did not want the salad at this point because the rest of us in the party had finished our appetizers.  Then, one of the employees brought the same salad out again with bell peppers. It was as if they wanted her to eat the salad no matter what she said. \\nI had the broiled seafood platter which had shrimp, salmon, scallops, lobster tail and vegetables.  Two of the three shrimps had the vein still in the shrimp, even though they had been butterflied.  I would hope that they cooks would have de-veined the shrimp but that was not the case. I ended up getting food poisoning and did not get much sleep.  When we called and spoke to a manager the following morning, her response was \\"I am sorry that happened, Thank you for letting us know, have a great day, by\\"   Because your kitchen did not handle the seafood correctly, one of your customers had food poisoning, and your management really did not seam to care.  We are not looking to have a bill adjustment, but a little more caring would go a long way.  As a result we will never dine at Rays on the River and tell everyone we know not to dine there."},{"name":"China Pearl Restaurant","address":"9 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I decided to come to this place again.

My boyfriend and I decided to go here for brunch today, and the problems started right when we walked through the door.\\n\\nThe place was nearly empty - maybe about 4 or 5 couch/coffee table areas filled - and there was no one waiting to be seated, and no hostess at the front desk.  So we waited...and waited...and waited some more.  Finally after about 5 or 6 minutes, we decided to look for their phone number, which we found on a box of matches they have at the front.  My boyfriend called them and the phone rang...and rang...and rang some more.  FINALLY someone picked up from a phone in the back, and my boyfriend ever so nonchalantly explained that there are two customers waiting at the front who would like to be seated.  She came out and was all like \\"Sorry!  I was in the back restocking.\\"  That's all well and good, but helloooo, the crap to stock will always be there.  Customers won't be.  Then the hostess tells us we can sit where we want.  So we just spent about 10 minutes at the front desk for nothing?!\\n\\nMost of the decent-looking couch/coffee table areas were taken, and it didn't look like they were seating people at the dining tables.  Right, because who doesn't want to try to eat pancakes and eggs hunched over a low table?  So we sat on two easy chairs in the corner, each with its own cheap wooden end table/crate-looking surface.  The hostess then brought us some menus and water and apologized again.  Uh huh.  So while waiting for the waiter to come over, my boyfriend and I tried to shake off the sour taste the place was already having.  Yeah, that didn't really work.  I noticed that the arms of our chairs had disgusting black STAINS all over them!  Then the waiter came over.  He was very pleasant, but at that point almost nothing could save our experience.  We asked for a couple more minutes to decide what we wanted, and continued to \\"look at the menu,\\" aka discuss whether or not we wanted to leave.  We ultimately decided that we couldn't be happy eating hunched over in stain-chairs.  Ironically, when we got up to leave, we had to dodge FOUR workers at the front - the bartender, our waiter (who was now being taught how to pour drinks by the bartender, even though he didn't look like he had his bartender's license), a waitress, and the hostess.  We walked by, probably as nonchalantly as my boyfriend was when he called them, and I oh-so-casually mentioned that we had to go.  The hostess, defeated, told us to have a nice day.  Then my boyfriend and I went up the street to Il Panino Express in the North End, and spent our money on something worthwhile.\\n\\nNow, perhaps that was just the brunch experience, but food or drinks, brunch, dinner or late night, those stains will always be on the chairs.\\n\\nCase in point, it's a good concept for a restaurant, but if it's gonna work, get some stain-resistant couches/chairs, and actually do your job when you're at work.\\n\\nThe one star goes to the fishies in the fish tank they had in the couch/coffee table/bar/hunch-to-eat-your-brunch room."},{"name":"Pappas Catering - Austin","address":"6513 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"We just had Pappas Catering at our wedding and were blown away.\\n\\nJuliet and her team did a fantastic job setting up, cooking, serving, bartending, bussing, and tearing down.

Among them was Zaftigs-praised greatly for their food and located conveniently right in Brookline!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I pinned Saturday down to be the day we stop by. Parking wasn't as difficult as I expected it to be and the wait was not too long either. After about fifteen minutes we were seated snugly next to another table. Maybe I'm a sucker for the simple things but I was elated when our server brought us toasted sesame bagel chips and creamed cheese! It didn't take long for me to decide what to order as I had already read that the Banana Stuffed French Toast was a MUST..and it certainly delivered. Upon arrival I thought the plate was wimpy looking. The plate can be described as two blocks of bread with date butter melted in the center with a hearty topping of strawberries and blueberries..but it was SO much more than that. Perhaps it's because I don't have any other french toast experience to compare this to but the loaves of bread that were served were velvet soft and fluffy and STUFFED with fragrant banana  served with sweet sweet syrup in a cute little spout and powdered sugar. I couldn't even finish half of it and pride myself in being able to scarf down ungodly amounts of food. \\n\\nThe boyfriend ordered the Empire Eggs which were two poached eggs on top of a slice of smoked salmon over potato pancakes topped with a Hollandaise sauce. I don't think he enjoyed it too much but I think the potato pancakes were stellar! They were full tasting and the eggs were perfectly poached as the yolks flooded the lunch plate. Although I did enjoy my sampling of the Empire Eggs, I don't believe them to be anything spectacular.\\n\\nNearing the end of our visit I snagged a glance at what some other patrons had ordered and i will definitely be coming back to give them a go. I saw what I thought was a reuben(?) to be STACKED a whopping 4-5 inches between toasted bread. I also think the matzo ball soup is something worth trying as well. We ordered the smoked salmon quesadilla as our appetizer. I know, it's weird sounding but it was good. however, it's something I definitely can cook up at home.\\n\\nI give my experience at Zaftigs 3 stars because our server that day seemed to be very unattentive and uninterested in my enthusiasm over my first time being at the restaurant.

AND that they closed at mid-night. It was not around 12:10. Maybe they should've considered cutting the list. No longer taking names and accommodating guest at a later date to make up for it. Um, Ok? We explained that we would rather sit comfortably - and eat than be squished at the table with a sleeping child on my lap (making it hard to eat). Finally, a manger stepped in - he was kind. Screaming on his mic from the second floor by us to have a booth on the 1st floor cleaned on the fly so that we can sit. We were finally escorted to our table, and were told to grab our drinks. Sat at our new table. The new server took 7 minutes to greet us. He took our order - top off our water - and came back with food about 20 minutes later.  My niece had the Tattchos - They were COLD the cheese was hard and cold as well. I ordered the Quiche (broccoli and cheese) - it was cold and hard. I couldn't even finish it. The salad was dry -- even tho I ordered it with dressing. My nephews french toast was cold and clearly thrown together. My son, who asked from a cup of cookies & cream ice cream had fallen asleep.

We were told these were JUST for display and assured not served! lol While we watched the pastry team taking gram crackers from the flies - and cupcakes from that \\"display\\" placed on milkshakes.

Pickles and onions. Ever since I've been eating BBQ it's always come with a side of dill pickle slices and white or yellow onions, to cut the grease and give it a little tang, and I would have loved those on my sandwich or on the side to eat with my fingers. \\n\\nThey also didn't have sausage anywhere on the menu.

Seriously though, I have visited this place many times over the years, when it was called Downtown Disney. I remember when the massive Virgin records mega-store came and went. Of course, this place has always been a little crowded, a little over-priced, and a whole lot of long walking. It seems like,with the new renovations, their goal was to take each of those negative aspects and multiply it. They've added poorly laid out parking garages which make getting in and out a huge, stressful chore. (I do give them credit for keeping the parking free though) Somehow, despite adding more stores, parking, and restaurants, it's become even more crowded. We couldn't find a spare corner, nook, or cranny to escape the on sought of ill-mannered tourists. The prices seem higher than ever before, and the whole place has a very generic feel to it.  I would recommend anyone (tourist or local), who is thinking about visiting here, rethink that idea and visit the Florida Mall, the outlet Malls, just about anywhere else instead.
