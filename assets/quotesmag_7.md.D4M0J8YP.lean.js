We were given a card with the oyster offerings for the day describing the flavours and origin- helpful for those who are not well versed with oysters. While waiting, the oysters were shucked in front of us. Next, was the Clam Chowder. I am surprised more people haven't reviewed it/order it. Creamy and velvety with generous chunks of clams. Last but not least, a Lobster Roll had to be ordered. Buttery goodness dripping out of a sweet soft bun served warm with a side of fries. The fries were good but nothing to rave about. \\n\\nAll in all our table agreed that the oysters and clam chowder were the meal highlights.\\n\\nService was great. Seated at the bar, the owner was serving us for the night. Friendly, he explained the process of catching the seafood for the day and recommended some amazing local beers to try.

The Kobe beef meatballs lived up to my expectations, and possibly surpassed it.  The beef flavor was so bold that it held up to the spiciness of the tomato garlic confit sauce.

The bartender let us try the Dim Summore (an Asian twist on the Mary), and it was so unexpectedly good! We ended up with the Dockside though because it came with a shrimp garnish. The drink wasn't as good, but for someone who doesn't like Bloody Mary's at all, this wasn't bad.\\n\\nFood: We shared the Tasty Steak & Cheddar Eggs. Omg this was another perfect start to our morning. We didn't want to overeat, and the portion was more than enough for the both of us. I was actually borderline stuffed. The steak was tender and cooked medium rare. Scrambled eggs with cheese melted in were fluffy and delightful. The real star was the cornbread pancake underneath it all. The skillet it came in created delicious crispy crusts on all the edges.

The interior is really cool.  I love all the wood, definitely makes you feel like you're in a barrel (which I assume is what they were going for).  I feel the bar seems like more of an EAV or L5P establishment.  It just had a more emo/grunge/hipster feel to it than I get from Midtown, in general. \\n\\nThe beer list is pretty extensive, but they have very little on tap.  Of the things they did have on tap, PBR was one of them...so definitely not an unusual or unique draft selection.  \\n\\nThe food is good.  I tried a series of small plates.  Specifically, the manchengo cheese was quite delicious, but I thought the cheese could have been a bit warmer.  The onion rings are tempura battered and very good, but a little too salty.  The heirloom tomato salad was my favorite dish.  The tomatoes were very hearty and the presentation was great.  My partner tried the mu shu duck and he really liked it as well.  Overall, I think the food will be great as soon as they work out a few kinks.  Prices are a little high...most mains are $13-$17, but not unreasonable for Midtown.\\n\\nThe service was attentive and prompt.  If anything, I'd say our waitress was a little too attentive...but I'd rather have too much attention than too little.\\n\\nI think I'll give this place a few months to work out the kinks and give it another try...it may be a 4 or 5 star place in the works."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was awesome!

This doesn't come close to any other shrimp and grits that I have made or have had down south.  Big disappointment.\\n\\nI ordered the beef rib $20 that was describe to come with a marshmallow stuffed purple sweet potato.  So I was a bit surprised to have \\"stripes/slices- about 3\\" of sweet potato that was rolled and stuffed with marshmallows.   OK, I thought that was a different way of serving and kinda of unique.

My wife and I couldn't enjoy polite conversation because it was too quiet and everyone would hear us- all 2 of the other customers.

About a week ago I went there twice and the gravy was rather greasy. I ordered a Chatfield to go - I was so excited! When I got home and opened it up, the gravy was extremely greasy.

The service each time has been really good, but the flavors are just slightly off. I ordered the shrimp and andouille cheddar grits, and while the grits were okay, the shrimp was awful. Chewy, flavorless/unseasoned, and from what I could tell, on the brink of going bad as it did leave behind a fishy aftertaste. I also didn't realize that the sausage would be in small diced chunks.

So I called for a reservation just to make sure that we would have a table ready for us. We got there at 9:30pm and found parking easy in their own parking garage. We then made our way up the elevator to the 30th floor where the restaurant is located(already beyond happy for choosing this place) we where seated and the waiter came right away and was friendly and very greeting. When we ordered we started with an asian fusion calamari, It was and is the best calamari I have ever had, I had trouble not making it my entre, then  I went for the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and an Alaskan king crab leg... I got my filet medium-well and it was cooked perfectly, my girlfriend ordered sea scallops on top of risotto. Everything was absolutely amazing the food was to the date the best I have ever had and the view was beyond perfect.

Chewy and really salty broth! Go with the mussels if you want to start with cooked bivalves, or just have fresh oysters. The oysters on piggyback is also nothing special. I felt like the entire dish was just a little soggy, with not enough aioli. When we brought this to the attention of the staff, she told us that the aioli was indeed there under the crostini...which we didn't really believe. However, we decided to let it slide. Tuesday's special was an uni pasta, but they ran out of that, so we just had raw uni by itself. He loved it. \\nHits and misses with our starters...and we go to our shared entree, the char. It was actually delicious, and it was both of our first introductions to farro (which we found that we loved). The fish was slightly less cooked than we would have liked, as it was completely raw in the center. That was forgivable as we did receive a large piece of fish, and everything on the plate was so flavorful. \\n\\nThen came the gross: THE HAIR. \\nI honestly could not eat any more after that, and when we mentioned this to one of the servers, she just said \\"Oh sorry, I'll let the kitchen know\\" and nothing else was done about that. After that, she just handed us our bill. \\nI expected more from an establishment like Neptune Oyster. We did not receive apologies from the chef, or any comps on our bill, no nothing. Am I a spoiled diner for expecting any of those things? \\n\\nI was really tempted to give this place 1 star from the most recent meal I had, but ultimately decided on 2 because I so love the oysters here, and because my guy loves this place.

It's right off the orange line and a short walk from Copley station (green line). The place itself is nice and pretty unassuming. It's a great place to head to after work with some co-workers to have a drink. Service is pretty good and the staff is generally friendly. The beer and drink selection is great and the food is also pretty good as well They have a good number of TVs, so if you want to watch a game this is a solid place to go. Prices are pretty good and portions follow suit. So if you are looking for a place to have something to eat that's not too far out of the way (should you be the in the area) then Clery's is a good choice.\\n\\nClery's as a place to go on a weekend night is another story. They are one of many bars in the Boston area that have fake lines. In other words, there will be plenty of space inside, but they maintain a line to make it appear as a happening place. Annoying but sometimes you have to just deal with it. My suggestion is to bring a flask. Once you do finally get in, there will be a line to get downstairs where there is a DJ playing music and you can dance. This line is an actual line as downstairs gets packed on the weekends. Oh and it's hot down there. So if you plan on coming here in the winter time, don't wear a sweater or anything heavy in addition to your jacket. As I said it gets cramped down here and it's a typical club/dance scene. The occasional sketchy guy lurking around groups of girls hoping to pick off the castoff of the group. On more than one occasion, the credit card machine was not working which was highly annoying. That pretty much killed the night and we had to move on to another bar. The one thing I will say is that there isn't a cover which is nice. \\n\\nI am giving this place 4 stars because as I said, if it's not a Friday or Saturday night, this place is great and me and my friends always come in here.

But figuring that traffic that a ways during the evening commute would be rather tough, we opted to go this a ways instead for an early weekday dinner.\\n\\nTurns out, we were wrong.  Unexpected traffic turned up between us and the restaurant and so we got there later than expected.  But street parking was shortly found, and we were immediately seated at one of their long booths along the right side of the restaurant.\\n\\nTheir bread was, as par for the course, served with the plate of Parmesan cheese sprinkled with red pepper flakes with a fresh pour of olive oil.  The cheesey oil as tempting as always, but the onions on our bread unappetizingly and completely blackened.\\n\\nService was fine, but the food was rather skimpy for your average Not Your Average Joe's.  Leftovers were always to be had during my visits to the Watertown location.  Here, my dad's haddock (herb-crusted haddock - pan seared and served with garlic mashed potatoes and herb roasted carrots 17.99) was miniscule beside the decent sized portions of terrific mashed and tasty carrots.  (Days later, he reiterated out of the blue that his piece of fish was so thin and small.)\\n\\nWhen the cutely presented twin towers of meatloaf (anything but average meatloaf, fresh mozzarella stuffed meatloaf, with saut√©ed veggies and mashed potatoes with barbeque gravy 15.50) arrived, it seemed rather puny in contrast to past experience.  Memory proved correct when I checked out my photo from our March visit to Watertown to see the thicker portions of meat.  Mom said the veggies were good though.\\n\\nThe burger eater at the table said the fries were crisp when they arrived.  By the end of the meal they were wimpy things though, even the thin little pieces which at times might be the only ones that have any crispness to them.\\n\\nAs for me, my carolina pecan chicken - chicken breasts crusted with pecans, pan seared and brushed with carolina mustard, served with chipotle sweet potato mash and garlicky saut√©ed spinach 15.50 - looked burnt due to their rather dark complexion,  but interestingly enough did not taste so.  The chicken were a bit on the dry side, however, my sides were both delicious.\\n\\nBased on this visit alone, I could not recommend visiting NYAJ's."},{"name":"Osteria Nino","address":"19 3rd Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"So mediocre...service was slow...we were long done with our drinks before we were asked if we were having another.

I had to wait a while (almost 8 minutes?) for them to refill the buffet table with food when the table was empty. \\n\\nThe place has a good amount of leather sofas, so it's a great place to chill out, though it might not be a great place to chill out if it gets really crowded. \\n\\n$10 for a Canadian Whiskey and Coke. That's a really steep price for a single glass. I would definitely not come back to get the mixed drinks, unless I have a really significant reason to buy one, but possibly for the beer, if the prices are not too steep. \\n\\nOverall I had a good time at this place, mainly because I met some really cool people to chat and hang out with, and I would not mind coming back again for the complimentary food. If it was not for meeting the really cool people, the comfortable environment, and the food, I may have given this place 2 stars out of 5. The drinks are probably among the most expensive I have seen in Boston, even though I have not been to many bars in the area.

Vegetarians also have their choice among the sides of hush puppies, corn fritters, beans, cornbread etc. Great atmosphere that is boisterous and bustling. Prepare for a wait during busy hours. \\n\\nMeat- favorite is absolutely the ribs, they are succulent and do not rely on the sauces to make them stellar, they already are tender and great. I think the true test of a good bbq place is when you can eat the meat without the sauce. I also love the catfish fritters or catfish in general fried to golden deliciousness without being too oily. The pulled pork and chicken are generously flavored. \\n\\nDrinks- if you a beer person then Red Bone will make you smile or incredibly confused since they have so many different varieties. Never fear because the Wheel of Beer is here! just give it a spin and you are a happy person with your pint. The rickeys are also good and have a hint of alcohol. \\n\\nDecoration- I just love that the decorators took the idea of bone and ran with it. The walls and ceiling are covered with colorful characters made out of bones or from a weird sci-fi movie. You can spend so much time just looking at the wall and think that the artists must have had some chemical help to come up with these inspirations."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Found this place on Yelp - just as good as everyone says.

But I really don't go around saying it in public much because I might look like a bem bomhead. I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it.\\n\\nI've had the chance to get Bem Bom several times now at various events. The quality of food they put out is up at the top of food trucks in the area, which is no small feat. There is a lot of competition. The Portuguese flavors are unique, and they use a lot of quality ingredients. Their lamb burger is exceptional - perhaps even divine. The Piri Piri had great flavors, but the chicken itself was so-so (kind of dry). The Chourico taco is fantastic with its fresh and tasty avocado!\\n\\nA few small complaints: \\n1) Service time tends to be slower. Twice now I have waited over 20 minutes for my food, which is high for a truck. It had me questioning whether or not they forgot my order a couple times, but no. For some reason it was just taking that long to make my taco while other orders were being taken and completed. All I ask is a heads up that it will take a little longer than normal and I'm cool. Don't leave me there to question my sanity and all of time & space. This has been during their more busy Tasty Tuesday events. Your mileage may vary.\\n\\n2) Price versus portion/quality doesn't match the competition. A few other trucks have this problem as well. Something like $10+ for a burger with no sides? It's a tough sell. The only way I'd order their $5 fries is if I had someone to split them with. I'm all for smaller portion sizes, but only if the cost comes reduced as well. The food is good, but it's not like miles ahead of other trucks. That's just my two cents.\\n\\n3) They haven't updated their menu in what seems like forever. If you're going to the truck for the first, this is a non-issue. But if you've gone several times, you find it more difficult to pull out your wallet. To get a decent sized meal you end up spending like $15 per person. I'd be willing to pay that for new adventurous meals that I haven't had before, but not for the same old. They need to mix things up -- have some Specials, have some combo deals with different sides.

I literally biked past this restaurant every day for half a year without ever noticing it, so I'm very glad to have been introduced to it.  The flavor combinations are unusual but work surprisingly well;  Bondir is certainly the most creative restaurant I've been to in this area.\\n\\nThe housemade breads we had were a 9 grain bread, a nori bread, and a cranberry walnut bread.  I enjoyed the flavor of all three, but I found the bread itself to be a bit tough.  We took the server's advice and ordered three course tasting portions with the following dishes:\\n\\nRed broiler chicken consomme with duck foie gras, goose foot spinach, and turnip green raviolini - Delicious broth, nice foie and raviolini, surprisingly light.\\n\\nSpiced-poached Forono beet with white nectarines, mutton prosciutto, Teff polenta, and yogurt vinaigrette - The nectarines were the star of the plate (and one of the highlights of the entire meal); they were some of the sweetest nectarines I've ever tasted.  I enjoyed the beets and prosciutto, which counteracted the sweetness of the nectarines well.  The yogurt vinaigrette was tasty as well.\\n\\nRed wheat cavatelli with chanterelle, Mousseron mushrooms in a pickled pig foot truffle vinaigrette, snow peas, garlic scapes, nasturtium, smoked scamorza - The pasta was perfectly cooked, but while I liked the vegetables, I found them to be surprisingly oily.  \\n\\nScituate scallops with guinea hog prosciutto, fresh onion, broccoli, Yukina savoy, olive oil toasted bread crumbs - The scallops were nicely cooked, but again, the vegetables were sitting in a small pool of oil.  The toasted bread crumbs added a nice texture to the plate.  \\n\\nRouen duck breast with Rhode Island white flint cornmeal cake, fava leaves, Marfax beans, and collard greens - The duck breast was perfectly cooked and was absolutely delicious.  I had never had Marfax beans and found them to be one of the best discoveries of the night; they added a needed sweetness to the plate and had a very special flavor.  The cornmeal cake was pretty good.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the rhubarb crostata and a sampling of their ice creams and sorbets.  The rhubarb crostata was delicious; the pastry was perfectly warm and flaky, and the rhubarb had a very nice flavor without being too sweet.  The crostata was accompanied by a malted vanilla gelato, which had great flavor but was a bit too icy in texture.  I sampled the juniper sorbet, toasted almond milk gelato, and strawberry cabernet ice cream.  The juniper sorbet was very refreshing, the strawberry ice cream was nice, and I enjoyed the toasted almond milk gelato, although I thought the flavor was the most subtle of the three.  I felt that the texture of the almond milk gelato was also a bit icy for ice cream.  \\n\\nThe homemade sodas are exceptionally good and surprisingly inexpensive at $3 a glass.  I tried the lemon lime soda and spiced ginger soda; the lemon lime soda was good, but the spiced ginger soda was on another level.  It was a mix of ginger, cardamon, and all spice.  Each sip was different, complex, and delicious.\\n\\nOverall, an excellent meal with interesting and unusual flavor combinations.  The meal was nicely paced, and service was helpful and knowledgeable."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place used to be good but it's going downhill quickly.

The Hash was absolutely delicious - the perfect combination of chorizo, banana peppers, hashbrowns....and some other components I cant remember. Also, the chai pancake was really yummy and creative.

There are however other tables with relatively good views. I came here to see fireworks with my friend. We were pleased with out \\"second row\\" table. The ambiance is nice, but my only grip was the food... which is kinda important.\\n\\nMy take on the food:\\n\\nCocktails: Ordered two Old Fashions to find water down, poorly made drinks. My friend and I have never returned any cocktails, but it was painful to drink. We decided to buy a bottle of wine instead, which led to two. \\n\\nRibeye: I was told by the server that this was the best ribeye in Portland. I found a good, not great cut of ribeye cooked medium (I asked for medium rare). Not only was it poorly seasoned, poorly cooked, It was served on top of mashed potatoes that I swear was 50% butter. \\n\\nScallops: The scallops were definitely fresh, and cooked properly. The tender, white (not translucent) meat of the scallop was absolutely amazing. All four scallops were cooked perfectly. Seasoning, however; that was the mood killer. I have to say that this was too much on the salty side for me. It was served on top of risotto which was at best, mediocre. \\n\\nDesert: GET THE SNICKERDOODLES!!! Amazing fresh baked deserts served a la mode. That was a surprising treat. Sweet, but not too sweet. \\n\\nSo in short, come here to pick off their reserve wine list and have desert after eating elsewhere. You'll be happier this way.

Think Dinosaur BBQ and Daisy May.  Redbones comes nowhere near this category.  The portions were big but the food was bland.  Smaller portions with taste would be better.

I've been 3 times since it's opened and I'll say up front, if you're looking for a traditional Chinese-American takeout place pushing Sesame Chicken and Lo Mein skip this joint. That said:\\n\\nThe good: the food. The Hunan dishes, especially. There are a lot of Sichuan dishes, too, but those are a bit more uneven (especially if you're pretty familiar with that cuisine) - although, they are passable and mostly delicious. Beef 'hot pot', cold chicken with Sichuan soy pepper paste, Hunan spicy fish (my favorite dish here so far), and many others really taste like authentic Chinese food (at least to this white guy who has had quite a bit of it). Prices are fair, too!\\n\\nThe average: the service is just average. Some English-language concerns but I can say most food items in busted-ass Mandarin so I can get by. Friendly, though. Cocktails are just okay. Wine list is small and centered on 'name' wineries but it fairly priced. \\n\\nThe bad: My Mandarin stinks, at best, and the menus are largely in Mandarin with really poor English translations. I can order food in Mandarin but without the GF translating characters I don't understand (with translations that are fairly hilarious and dead wrong), I'd be pretty lost. This might not be an issue to fluent Mandarin speakers but for about 98% of the Brookline population it poses a business issue for Xiang Yu. \\n\\nIf you want some of the most authentic Chinese food in greater Boston, try Xiang Yu. I continue to return and will do so when we don't feel like firing up the wok at home or traveling into Watertown for Home Taste (a superior option, in my opinion!)."},{"name":"Garbo's Lobster Truck","address":"12709 N.

Cuatro and I had a long talk about it (like I said, he really is listening and working on stuff) and it sounds like they don't have room (the kitchen is small) to have a smoker.  So the pork is oven-cooked.  But he's kicking around other options.\\n\\nI ran into Jens while I was there... and from what I can tell, when you hit Cuatros, it's pretty likely that you too will have the opportunity to meet and hang with Jens.  Take it... he's SUPER cool.  But yeah, my experience was (and Jens saw and commented) that the service still needs work.  But in my book service is broken down into two categories... are they cool, and are they responsive.  My server (same one I had last time) was very very cool and sweet.  I liked her a lot.  But she took a while to get things to me and I had to ask a couple of times.

They also make the best and most authentic Irish Breakfast i've had in the Boston area. The staff comes off as surely some times but they're responsive to a little wise assery so it evens out. Kid friendly too, which can be good or bad depending on if you either have kids or don't hate them. And the orange juice came in a 12oz cup, not one of those rinky dink little cups like most diners."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The reviews are right on.

My husband and I have eaten here a few times and we like it.

Saturday nights get busy, understand... however, my second issue was the food itself. I got home and began eating ( didn't even plate it, straight out of the container) and I took a bite and started coughing. I coughed up what looked like paper.

I normally don't even bother going out on Valentine's due to the \\"amateur night\\" BS, but I was jonesing for a margarita and I've enjoyed this place before.\\n\\nOkay, for those of you who think you know the best Mexican in the ATL, you are wrong.  You don't  need to go to a hole in the wall, to get the best. I know you may think you are being \\"authentic\\" by going to an off the beaten path type of place, but tonight solidified my feelings about Rosa's - Valentine's Day or any other day, this place IS the best kept secret in Atlanta.  Where shall I begin?   Perhaps the beautiful solo romantic guitar player they brought in for the special Valentine's night.  What a great touch - not too light, not to heavy, just right, and did I say romantic??  The service was fantastic, as always.  The tableside guac cannot be beat.  Homemade CORN tortillas, not the crap flour you get in most other places, and yes, the tortillas are fresh.  Even though we didn't order off the special Valentine's menu, the entrees' were excellent. Their sauces are high quality and well thought out.  The mole' my husband had was the best mole' I've ever had in my life - all the subtle flavors were present.  After dinner, even though we didn't order dessert, they brought out chocolate as a treat.  As if that wasn't enough, they even gave us a gift bag as we were leaving.  I later looked inside and in it was a nice sized bottle of dessert salsa, the kind you can pour on ice cream, which I shall do tomorrow night. How different and unexpected; who does this??  What a nice/generous touch!  Not to mention, the ingredients in this salsa are so unique - nuts, raspberries, chocolate chips and peppers!  I cannot wait to try it.\\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the signature margaritas - pomegranate.  This place started the pomegranate craze and they do it the best, hands down.

From the formal servers in suits, to the red quilted fabric on the ceiling to the Buckhead-over-60 crowd, there's little that's modern about it. I almost expected to see Frank Sinatra walk in the door. So dress up, and plan on spending a evening partying like your grandparents did. \\n\\nThis was our second visit in 3 weeks and both experiences were flawless. Expect to drop some serious cash though. You could easily spend over $100/per person. \\n\\nif you're up for that, don't miss the venison. if you're a vegetarian, you may be limited to the pasta dishes, but they won't disappoint. Portions are very generous. Study up on your italian wines, otherwise you'll be lost. The desserts are painful they're so yummy. \\n\\nI dream about the cold veal loin appetizer. \\n\\nNow, it would be a shame to miss this experience because you can't spend the cash. Here's a couple tips to  take a more frugal approach:\\n\\nGo when you can order the $23.95 \\"stimulus menu\\". If that's not possoible:\\nOrder wine from the specials list and you'll have a couple of choices under $40/bottle.\\nOrder apps for your main. There are SO many good choices. You won't go hungry, especially with all the bread they bring you. \\nSkip the heavenly desserts; (sorry) they're pretty pricey. \\nSplit a salad-- they're fairly huge. \\n\\nMake reservations-- and don't wait til the day before or you might miss out.

The staff was extremely friendly and worked hard and very efficiently and was able to serve our whole group really quickly!  And, I honestly was expecting the pizza to be not-very-good, kinda cardboard-y or almost like a frozen pizza, but it was NOT!  We ordered the Margherita pizza, and the toppings were really well balanced, and I think they even threw on some oregano on there for some really good flavor.  Overall, out of the group of 50+  hungry, adults, we were all satisfied, and there was not a crumb left behind!  And, we had the blazer game on the tv, and the Blazers won \\"For us\\" so that was really exciting as well!

You're a perfect candidate to go eat at Moe's.\\n\\nMoe's is basically like Chipotle, if Chipotle had a free salsa bar, lower-quality ingredients, and free, average-quality chips.\\n\\nThis particular Moe's location is no exception. It has plenty of parking, although like many other restaurants in the area its lot is divided between 2 locations. Fortunately, the street running through the lots is mostly unused and the area isn't creepy or anything, so it isn't a big deal. For around $7 you can get a decent burrito, and it comes with free chips. The salsa bar is always welcome, and there are a pretty decent number of salsa types on offer.\\n\\nMoe's offers more optional ingredients than Chipotle, but all the ingredients taste less fresh and savory than the big C's. Again, it's quantity over quality by a decent margin here. The service is fine and the interior is clean, but this Moe's shares a street with not only a very close-by Chipotle, but also a slightly less closer-by Willy's burrito joint, and also an El Azteca.

Get ready to spend $70 for a dinner for two, since only water is included in the buffet price (soda and tea are $1 extra per person). But, you know what? You come to a buffet for the challenge of it all: eat what you paid for. And, at Maki Maki, you can do just that.\\n\\nUnlike other sushi buffets I've been to, I'm fairly confident that the fish they use did not just come out of a deep-freezer that it was put in weeks ago. The quality was definitely there and I enjoyed it all: the sashimi, the maki rolls, the creative stuff (a wide variety of fish-based and fish-free salads, soups, hot dishes, cold dishes, and so much more).\\n\\nThe desserts were very nice, too, except for the mocha mousse... which was just wrong in so many ways. They went a little \\"Country Buffet\\" style by having a chocolate fountain as part of their desserts, but it's yummy and you know you will go for it. Just get ready to stand in line behind a family of 5 while each child demands, \\"DADDY, I WANT TO DO IT MYSELF!!!\\"\\n\\nThe only negatives aside from the steep price are:\\n\\n+ The overly-attentive staff. If you've ever been to Japan, you know that the waitresses in restaurants over there are very loud, very in your face, and very attentive; however, when they do this in the English language, it is a little much. Our waitress went as far as to come over and ask me questions about what I was texting! I took a photo of my food to send to my parents, and she comes over, puts her hand on my shoulder, and starts berating me with questions about my family! She never let an empty plate sit at the table for more than 30 seconds, which was nice, but she came to our table every 5 minutes or so saying, \\"You can eat more! Go eat more at the buffet! You are not done, are you?\\" etc.\\n\\n+ Flies. Not only did I enjoy the food, but the flies that were flying around the salads looked like they were enjoying it, too.\\n\\nOverall, this place is as my review is rated: A-OK.

I found Luke's on Yelp many many weeks before the trip and was thrilled it was so close to the hotel.  I was so excited to try it but then a little put off when I realized it was a chain and even has locations in DC.  So really I could theoretically have it any time.  I figured I would wait and see where the days took us and decide on lobster rolls accordingly as the mood set in.\\n\\nMy teenage son was my traveling companion as I made him go on a college visit during the trip.  He has developed quiet a refined taste in food but is too lazy to read up on reviews despite being glued to an electronic device at all times.  So I took it upon myself to insist on lobster rolls our second night in town when it turned out to be cool and drizzly out.  Not a night for venturing far.  In fact we had it all planned out how we would make the food run and then come back to the hotel to watch a movie in the room.\\n\\nIt was quieter than I expected but that meant very little wait.  I was intrigued to watch the person make our rolls.  I didn't quite observe when the rolls were toasted but I knew that they would be.  I did see the lobster meat being pulled out of little plastic bags.  I don't know if this was because it was preportioned or what.  Then out came the little baster tool with the butter being squeezed over the roll.  OMG couldn't wait to try it.\\n\\nYes it is small and yes sometimes size matters but I imagine it would be way more expensive if the size were what most people think they should get.  So no, it is not a foot long.  It is probably more of a 4 inch roll to be realistic but as other reviewers have pointed out, it is packed with a punch and it was yummy delicious.  No regrets!  We each had a roll and I had the lobster bisque and my son had the clam chowder which he let me taste.  Both were great but we were each glad with our own picks.  They ran out of the claws which would have been a nice add on but it was fine.  We had other snacks to supplement our meal with and in the end, it was just right.\\n\\nMaybe it is a good thing there are locations in DC so I don't have to wait so long before having another!"},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"What a fun place to go for dinner!

Our reservations were at 5:30, but because they gave us time between courses to sit and relax, we didn't finish until around 8:00.  During those two and a half hours, the place steadily filled up with hordes of nicely dressed yuppies chattering away in the restaurant's warm lighting.\\n\\nThe food itself was delicious - modern Italian with a twist.  As soon as we sat down, they dumped bunches of bread sticks on the table (in a stylish way, of course), accompanied by a creamy light green pesto dip.  For an appetizer, the bf and I split a mozzarella plate with thin slices of persimmon and proscuitto.  I then had the beet ravioli in tangerine oil for my entree, which was one of the more unusual pasta dishes I've ever had.  The tangerine oil and beet filling were sweet, but it was balanced out with some kind of cream that came in a dollop on each ravioli.  All in all, a terrific dish (and I loved the bright red color of the ravioli filling).  Finally, for dessert I tried the chocolate cake with white coffee ice cream.  It was good, but the chocolate got to be way too rich after a while, so my friend polished the rest off for me.

I would most likely give it 4.5 stars if I could. As a note, I reserve five stars for places where I am seriously impressed or surprised by the food, service, or ambience.\\n\\nI first expected the restaurant to be organized more like other fast casual restaurants like Chipotle or Shake Shack, where you order at the counter and then pick up food yourself. But it is a sit down restaurant with a small bar; you can also order take out. People ordering take out did not seem to have anywhere to stand, and I can see it being chaotic if the place gets busy. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. \\n\\nService was friendly, attentive, and extremely fast - I was pretty impressed how quickly I received my burger. Definitely at fast food speeds in a nice sit down environment. \\n\\nFood wise, I love waffle fries in general. Just for that, this place has a slight edge over other burger spots. Their waffle fries are piping hot and crispy - fresher than Chickfila's sometimes limp waffle fries. The burgers here are 'simple diner style' rather than zany combinations like Boston burger company(?) There are a lot of topping options, but I stuck with a simple combination. The burger was flavorful, moist, and not overly greasy with a good 'crust'. I still find shake shack's burger to have that best slightly crunchy exterior that I love in a burger. Potato bun was soft and excellent too; the burger did not fall apart at the slightest. These burgers come with two patties, which is odd, but really quite good and very filling. Out of curiosity, I looked at their other location's menu and it was structured slightly differently, where you can customize the number of patties. Value wise, it seems pricey at 11$ for a double cheeseburger, but given the burger is quite big and comes with fries, I think it's a good price. \\n\\nI highly suggest checking the place out if you live nearby and have a burger craving. And if you do not want a thick pub style burger from the Druid. Wu burger is also worth eating in, since the atmosphere is pretty nice and the service is friendly/fast.

The inside isn't overly impressive as well.  It's hand painted and has a cool vibe, but you can tell that both the paint job and the furniture is a little dated.  I do like that they have some of the most popular menu items painted in big bold letters on wooden signs on the back wall over by the kitchen.  The atmosphere is alright.  Usually nice and relaxed, very informal, but I don't know that you come to redbones for the crowd or the decor anyways.  You come for the food.  Now I haven't tried everything but from what I have tried: Their pulled pork sandwich, grilled salmon, brisket, mac and cheese, dirty rice, black bean pudding, caramel custard, all were very good.  The mac and cheese was especially delicious.  So when it looks worn and aged on the outside you know they're doing something right on the inside: they've been there for a while because they sure know how to cook.  And they also have some really good beers on tap too!  I also like that the non-alcoholic drinks come in Mason jars.  It's a nice touch to give it a good homely feel.  \\n\\nAnother nice touch is that every meal comes with cornbread for the table.  The food is very moderately priced too considering how big the portions are.  I do agree with one of the other reviewers who said that they skimp on the sauce a bit...  The grilled salmon didn't come with anything on it so it was kind of dry... there was lemon on the side but considering the name of the restaurant is \\"Redbones bbq\\" I was hoping they would have some really good home-made sauces.  So when I came back the next time and ordered the brisket I made sure to ask for some sauce on it.  I got a mild bbq sauce on it which was tasty but not overly memorable.  Next time I'll have to try something a little more spicy.  \\n\\nIn short Redbones is a cool place to come and eat some solid food and kick back a few good beers with some friends on a Sunday or lazy weeknight.  There is a bar upstairs that is sort of attached to the dining room but there are only a couple seats that can see the t.v.'s in the dining room.  My roomate and I managed to sit there and watch some of the sox playoff games while we ate so that was kind of cool but if it was crowded I doubt we could have snagged those seats.  \\n\\nThe bar upstairs seemed kind of small but there is also a set of stairs leading to the basement immediately to the left when you walk in that leads downstairs to a bigger open bar/dance type area which you wouldn't notice unless someone told you or you were looking for it.  I need to go back some time and check that out.  Seemed kinda cool.

I have been there several times and am always happy with the food and the experience. You will definitely wait if you go on a weekend for brunch, but the wait is definitely worth it all the way. \\n\\nI was at Murphy's recently for brunch with two girlfriends. We waited a bit for a table, but were coming in later in the brunch rush (around 1:30pm) so the wait wasn't really too bad. Once we were seated, our server was immediately there ready to help with whatever drinks or foods we were ready to order. On a side note, I think the staff at Murphy's is really great, they're always attentive and pleasant to their customers even when they are extremely busy. \\n\\nFor breakfast each of us got a different dish. I had the Eggs Sante Fe. This dish is my favorite and I usually order it whenever I go. It consists of scrambled eggs, cheese and peppers wrapped in a flour tortialla with salsa and sour cream on top. I got it with the hash browns (without cheese - although I've heard with cheese is good too). The meal was absolutely great and was the perfect start to my Saturday morning. My friends got the pancakes and grits, and the eggs Virginia Highland (a take on eggs benedict) both of which they loved as well. \\n\\nI have also been to Murphy's for dessert. They have a really great selection of sweets and their dessert trio is the perfect way to experience many of them. It comes with bonzo cake  (a fudgy brownie cheesecake), vanilla bean panna cotta, and tollhouse pie (a mix of cookies and ice cream). They were all absolutely fabulous (I am a bit of a sucker for baked goods and ice cream though). Pair the trio with a glass of wine or one of their many coffee drinks and you have the PERFECT after dinner treat. I got an Irish coffee and it was the perfect match!\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place for brunch, wine, or dessert.

The place is empty (for a bit), quiet(er), and you get the right amount of attention from the great staff there. Needless to say, it's harder (not impossible) to flag someone down during one of their regular dinner services.\\n\\nIf you decide to take on dinner be warned - you will be surrounded by a lot of hungry, cranky tourists. They will go on and on about how hungry they are and how they've been waiting forever (even if they showed up after you did) and complain to the extremely professional staff about how they're ready to leave if they're not seated soon. Yappy, miserable tourists will ruin your appetite.\\n\\nDo one of two things.

They make guacamole table-side and it comes with chips and these cute mini tortillas.  I had the Mexican version of the Cuban sandwich and it was huge! It came with sweet potato fries, which were quite possibly the best I have had. Everything about the sandwich was great, and I was able to take home half of it for another meal. Rice and this weird, black bean puree were included for everyone at the table. They also apparently have an ice cream festival (selection of a few different ice creams) but I was too full to try that. Our service was also superb for such a large group. One of my coworkers hates cheese, and of course, everything he ordered came covered in it.

There are no low tables, no tables at all in fact which feels more authentic but is less practical near the Atlanta perimeter. I generally would choose a high table but the counter only option would have been less comfortable with a group of 3-4 people. The business sense behind no tables encourages take out which reduces cleaning costs (a la \\"The founder\\") and the location on that side of the street is more representative of people having just exited the freeway and heading home.

One of the ways do that is by trying out all types of Asian noodle soups. I looked at some (non-Yelp) reviews of ramen shops in downtown Portland and nothing really stood out. I read reviews of Stretch the Noodle and decided to check it out. This is the real deal. I went at 4:30 pm and there was one lady ahead of me getting a takeout order. Then it was my turn. I asked for the La Mian. The lady taking the order (who is also the chef and I mean that rather than cook) said \\"The number one?\\"  I said yes. \\n\\nThere's a reason why it's the number one. Maybe it's the most ordered item. I don't know. But it's one of the best bowls of noodle soup that I have ever had. So \\"number one\\" is a good way to describe this. The chef started by reaching into a tub of dough and used a dough scraper to cut off a portion. Then she rolled it out lengthwise and began the pulling/stretching process. Eventually there was a fair amount of medium to thick noodles that were quickly boiled. The noodles went into a bowl followed by a rich broth packed with flavor. Some quickly blanched greens and cubes of tender, tasty beef and various spices (you get to specify the amount of heat). \\n\\nThere's a small area on the side with a counter and some stools if you choose to eat there as I did. Again one of the best bowls of Asian noodle soup I have been fortunate enough to eat. All of this for a price of $8.00. Eight dollars!  I tipped $2 even before the bowl was ready because it's hard nowadays to find good ramen in the US for $10.  This place should be packed. Go and spend the best $10 you have spent in a very long time.

As with majority of people, the warm lobster roll had been my favorite dish only because it is not easy to find warm lobster rolls. All other dishes there have been good with the exception of the Clam Chowder which is lackluster. \\n\\nEven with the popularity of the place, I still enjoyed the lobster roll until yesterday. A little background: last week I was in CT and ended up at a restaurant that yes, had warm lobster rolls. I really enjoyed it but wished they used the same bread as Neptune Oyster. Since I had that in mind, I decided to stop by Neptune yesterday around lunch and shockingly, was able to be seated almost immediately (since I was solo, I guess). \\n\\nOf course, I got the lobster roll and was rather surprised to see that there had been some changes since my last visit there mid-August. The meal portion was considerably smaller, even the fries. I did not complain though since the prior portions were considerably large and this one was somewhat manageable but, it is about perception. The bread not as sweet as it used to be, there was barely any butter on mine, and the lobster was overcooked. Now, if that was my first time there I probably would have raved about the lobster roll but sadly, for me it demonstrated a negative turn and all I can think of is that other warm lobster roll in CT.  \\n\\nAs I looked around, it was easier to count the people that did NOT have the lobster roll which I think explains the significant drop in standards. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I do not know when and if I will be back but if I do return I certainly will not be getting the famous lobster roll."},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Had to try this place after going to Sublime donuts earlier this week to do a quick comparison.

Tried the orange pistachio since that sounded like an interesting combo, and then took a toasted almond one, but was tempted to try coconut. Next time. The orange pistachio topping was very good- a fresh orange juice taste that I liked, but for a yeast donut, it was too heavy and kind of chewy- not what I expected.

Big mistake. She ordered a number 11 which purported to come with multiple pieces of chicken nuggets, 3 dipping sauces, Texas toast, tater tots and onion rings. I ordered their new chicken sandwich that came with pickles and an order of tater tots. They gave me the wrong sandwich but at least it was almost right. My mother's order consisted of a pile of tater tots, 1 piece of chicken and what looked like wheat bread heated in a microwave. No onion rings. No dipping sauces. We called the waitress back to see what happened and she informed us that they were out of onion rings and dipping sauces. Um, okay? One might think you'd tell the customer that when they ordered the meal and not hoped they didn't notice? So, my mother then asked to exchange her untouched meal for another one. The waitress had to ask her manager. Her manager said no. My mother said she was dissatisfied and wanted her money back. The waitress returned and said no again and that the manager said to email corporate. Nice. \\nOther issues with this lovely meal included no silverware (and my mother ordered an Oreo shake that you clearly needed a spoon for), no napkins and as I mentioned, the wrong item in mine. \\nI emailed corporate and all I received was a template email that they would look into it.

It may have had the best clam chowder I have ever eaten. The chowder had the perfect balance of not too watery but not too thick either. Of course, the clams were fresh. Another differentiator was that it was seasoned and garnished extremely well. While the raw bar was not the best I ever had (I was blown away by Blue Water Cafe in Vancouver recently in May), it was excellent. I ordered the oysters and clams. They were very fresh and I could pleasantly taste the ocean still in them. The cocktail sauce was very hot. I preferred the one that tasted more like soy sauce. The Acadian Redfish & Chips were also great. The fish was incredible: very fresh and smooth. On the other hand, it could have been breaded a little more. The fried breading seemed too thin. The couple next to us ordered the swordfish and it looked immaculate. Not surprisingly, Neptune is also known for its lobster rolls.\\n\\nThe wait time for Neptune on the weekend is epic. It is a small restaurant so it fills up fast. Guests line up 30-40 minutes before it opens so they can grab a seat. We showed up 15 minutes after it opened on a Sunday. At first, we thought we got lucky because it did not seem that long. However, we eventually realized that the line was just to put our names on the list. We were given an estimate of 2  1/2 hours for 5 people. We waited for 2 hours. By the time we were seated, we overheard the host estimate a 4 hour wait for a party. Is it worth the wait? It depends. They call you when your table is ready so you can walk around Faneuil Hall, the rest of North End, or the Waterfront while you wait. If you plan on being in the area anyway, then the wait is worth it. I would never stand in line in front of a restaurant for two hours.\\n\\nIf you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

I never even got to go inside since my friend got us a table outside.  She ordered for us the Organic Mixed Green Salad, with mango, candied cashews and a curry leaf dressing.  It was okay, not too exciting.  Also got the Moan Style Mussels, steamed in coconut curry with fresh chiles.  They were pretty mild, not fishy.  Also got an order of the Dal Fritters, which the waitress assured me was gluten-free.  They were pretty awesome!  The fritters are coated with crushed up lentils to give it that crunch factor, then it was served up with two chutneys.  We got the rhubarb chutney and fresh coriander chutney.  I liked the rhubarb one the best, it's got some spice to it!  To drink I got their tamarind margarita, not bad at all.  I would agree with prior reviews that this is not the place to go if you're looking for regular Indian food.

We made a reservation on www.opentable.com, at 4:30 for 6:00pm.

But the sangria was very tasty and easy to drink.  The brought it out with some double old fashion glasses, which made it seem like it took us forever to drink it all...so next time (wait...does that mean I'll be going back?)....I'll ask for a high-ball, just to get it over with....and not have to constantly be re-filling such a small glass.\\n\\nI'll go again, because I had a good time, and the staff was on point, checked back on us enuff not to be intrusive, and still made sure we had whatever we needed.  Even posed for pictures (yes, Im corny that way), and my son, who was only drinking water, even commented on how often the glasses were kept full.  Funny how a little thing like keeping the water glass full, makes you think, wow....great service.\\n\\nFYI, the patio fills up fast, there are only two tables in the patio area that will seat 3-4 people.  There is also a \\"lounge\\" area on the patio where you can only order drinks and appitizers.....so....I think the lounge/bar area will be my next choices, as I dont have to spend $15 on these particluar chicken tacos ever again.\\n\\nPricey, but the service and sangria...made it ole so worth it."},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Only went here because it happened to be the one restaurant nearby that had power during a power outage. ***Important to note because it has bearing on the rating.\\n\\nThe wait to be seated was not bad at all, and is pretty standard for a lunch wait.

First time - to see what the hype is about and second - to fulfill a wings & oyster craving. Needless to say, the craving was not fulfilled.\\n\\nMy friends and I went to Hooters on a Monday night. I repeat, MONDAY night. Service shouldn't be too bad right? Sox were playing, but obviously nobody goes to Hooters to pay attention to a baseball game. We were promptly seated by who I'm assuming to be the manager. He was friendly and welcoming and quite frankly the only positive part of it all. Unfortunately, we just so happened to get the worst waitress out of the entire restaurant. She takes bad service to another level where I didn't even know it could go. Asian restaurants couldn't be this bad even if they tried.\\n\\nNot only did it take her 45 minutes to bring out our drinks (a beer, a margarita, and a water - WATER), but she also managed to mess up our order of 30 wings and a dozen oysters. She offered my friends another round of drinks on the house to make up for the wait, but they never got them. After waiting about 30-45 minutes, we finally got the oysters and then about another 30 minutes later, we got the wings - someone else's wings. After a minute of confusion on our part, she realized her mistake and whisked the wings away to give to the right table - never once asked us if we touched them or ate one. Good thing for her though that the table who ordered those wings didn't notice her mistake. She finally comes out a few minutes later with the right wings that we ordered but we were still missing 10 wings. 10 wings that apparently she never wrote down, even though she repeated our order after we said it. She informed us that the kitchen messed up our order of wings and that's why it took so long. However, being that we ordered the wings naked, 20 wings really shouldn't have taken an hour long. As for their wings, there really is nothing special about them. 911 is at best mild, not hot. For a place known for their wings (among other things) they're a big disappointment.\\n\\nSo to round out this mess of a night, the waitress even got our bill wrong. The oysters were missing and in its place instead was the order of wings that we never got. We told the waitress about this mistake, but in order to avoid even more confusion, she just left it and told us to pay for what was there since the wings were cheaper than the oysters anyways. There's a lot of potential for Hooters to be great, but unfortunately the Saugus one falls short on all levels."},{"name":"Demo's","address":"146 Lexington St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"I've been going here with my boyfriend non stop since I discovered it.

We arrived a bit early for our reservation, but were glad to see we could be seated almost right away. After being seated, the waiter attended to us within reasonable time. However, when we asked him for wine recommendations, specifically for wine that may go well with that was offered on the Magical Dining menu, he directed us to the wine menu and told us any of the first four would be good. I was hoping for a little more direction. \\nFor the appetizer, I had the clam chowder and my boyfriend had the fried tomatoes. My chowder tasted okay, but the fried tomatoes had a better presentation and looked more appealing. \\nMy main course consisted of the Catch of the Day, which was rainbow trout, and I opted for Beurre Blanc. As you might expect by the title of the dish, the plate was white -- white fish, white sauce, white mashed potatoes. The flavor was bland and after a couple bites, i had a mess of white on my plate. There were no garnishments or anything to liven up the plate, which I would have expected due to the quality and presentation of the restaurant. \\nFinally, for dessert, I had the strawberry shortcake. I will admit I do not have much of a sweet tooth but once again I was slightly disappointed. The cake portion tasted like the average cake from Publix, which is okay, but since I'm not paying Publix prices, I was not impressed. \\nOverall, I give this restaurant three stars because it was an average experience but the restaurant was clean and presentable. The waiter only checked on our table 2x during our whole time at the restaurant, and based on my experience, I think our $200 bill (4 dinners + wine bottle) seemed overrated.

Their chicken tikki masala is solid, and I just learned they do lamb tikki masala as well so will def by trying that next. The \\"combo\\" meals they have are good, a vegetable curry, basmati rice, then a meat curry of your choice alongside a naan and a rice pudding dessert. Great variety and a solid dish, I prefer the lamb over goat and chicken. Two things I'd note as detractors: the portions are a bit lacking in meat, usually around only six or eight small cubes of chicken in a $9 chicken tikki masala, so have a half-scoop of that 0carb Isopure protein on the side and you're rounded out, and there is a solid amount of grease atop many of the dishes, a spoon and a napkin can handle it right quick although still more than I'm down with. Nothing that won't stop me from coming back given the convenience, quality, and management is also cool. Stevi (sp?) is very cordial, and once insisted I take a free lamb combo as he'd given me chicken instead of lamb the last time by accident, I was about a dollar off given that I overpaid a dollar the last time, but he wouldn't have it and passed it on gratis.

Alligator & shrimp \\"cheesecake\\", onion rings, fried pickle slices, French bread, shrimp in a hearty sauce. All these were quite good, I personally liked the huge onion rings with the Remoulade sauce. Many others raved about the cheesecake which despite it's name is not a dessert at all but more like a loaf or casserole. Only bad thing was the cheesecake was kinda hard to slice up and split with people, I personally thought it was good but not great, though most everyone else loved it.\\n\\nOur server wisely kept the drinks flowing, they had a wide variety of cocktails: Hurricanes, Sazerac, Mint Juleps, and beers served in large heavy chilled thick glass goblets.

I love grits but most places don't know how to make them. Tibbys sure does! This dish was spectacular, tons of rich flavor, it had a dark broth pooled around the edges which had a great rich flavor. The Andouille were finely diced and the onions were cooked until soft and glistening but not darkened. Onions which are typically the strongest flavor of a dish were a nice mild light bite which complemented the other bold flavors if the sauce, grits and sausage. The grits were thick and well flavored with cheese. I was very impressed with this dish.\\n\\nSaut√©ed shrimp, andouille sausage & sweet onions over cheese grits & finished\\nwith a red wine gravy.\\n\\nWe finished off with Beignets, piled with powdered sugar they were large and pretty good, I had to specifically ask for chicory coffee, which our server should have suggested, but it was the middle of the day so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.

Make sure you don't laugh or breath too heavy while eating your Beignets or you may end up looking like Tony Montana with white powder all over your face.\\n\\nI can't wait to return to Tibby's and try the gumbo, po boys, crawfish pie and everything.\\n\\nhttp://www.tibbysneworleanskitchen.com/"},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Really great!

The first time we went to Cork and Fork, we fell in love with the place. The concept wasn't brand new, lots of farm to table places have cropped up in recent years, but the food was superb. The Bistro Steak Sandwich was outrageous, and my fiancee loved her Drunken Scallops.\\n\\nWe went back the next day for dinner, and two days later for brunch. Sure it's overkill, but the food was superb. We probably went 2 or 3 more times over the next few weeks. The food was fresh, the service was great, and everything was awesome.\\n\\nOf course, over all that time, we noticed no one was really eating there. We had hoped business would pick up because the food was excellent. \\n\\nMy fiancee went in a couple of weeks ago with her family and said that things had changed. The make up of the plates was completely different. I had previously ordered the Fried Dough at brunch, and it came full of tender steak and delicious goat cheese. The dough was baked perfectly and it was a huge portion. Her cousin ordered it on my suggestion, and she said it wasn't anything like I described. Still wasn't bad, but what I ordered was great, and when she ordered the same thing, she got an average entree.\\n\\nWe went back once more the following week and I couldn't believe how things changed. My fiancee ordered that same Fried Dough, and it looked like someone cut 3 English muffins in half, crumpled it up, and put dog food on it. No goat cheese, barely any arugula... just  flavorless bits of meat strewn about. I ordered the Breakfast Burger and I was absolutely appalled. One of the best parts of Cork and Fork was their french fries: natural cut, golden brown, absolutely perfect. The fries I received that day were packaged, frozen french fries. The burger I was served was a 100% pre-made, frozen patty. I had barbecued the week prior and cut corners and ordered pre-packaged, frozen Walmart burgers, and Walmart knocked it out of the park compared to what I got that day. \\n\\nI totally understand why the food declined so quickly: if your profits aren't going up, your food costs must go down. It's a shame though, because Cork and Fork was an incredible restaurant, and had it been able to brand and market a little bit better, it would have been an absolute home run. It could still happen, but the food I ate wasn't fresh, wasn't farm to table, and wasn't as advertised. We woofed our food down just by virtue of being in a rush to get to a movie, paid the bill, and sadly vowed not to go back.

Expect a tiny restaurant, expect  a crowd, expect a wait, and expect EXCELLENT seafood! The wait can be one to two hours long depending what time you get here. Come here by 5pm if you want to eat within a reasonable time; it's busy here every night! hint hint, this restaurant doesn't take reservation. \\n\\nHere's my take on my order:\\n\\nTriton Plateau ($58) : This is one of their seafood platter (Neptune Plateau is double the amount) that offers you a tasting of their best offers. 6 raw oysters, 3 raw clams, 3 raw little neck clams, 8 cooked and chilled mussels, 3 gigantic shrimp cocktail, a bowl of crab mix, and a bowl of lobster mix. This was the BOMB! The portion is enough for two people if you decide to share an entree later on, but if you want to order this as a taster, it's enough for a party of 4. Everything on the platter was so fresh, it literally feels like the shells were just opened in the ocean....drool! It's an absolute steal because the portion was go generous. If you're visiting and want a seafood experience, get the platter and you won't regret it! \\n\\nLobster Roll ($25): Their most popular dish and I can understand why! The lobster is fresh and chunky and the meat is generously piled on top of the buttered bread, Oh My! The Lobster Roll also generously comes with another pile of fries (Belgium?). I would recommend sharing the Lobster roll if you want to try other stuff on the menu. In general, there's plenty of reviews on here and they are right, GET THE LOBSTER ROLL! \\n\\nMenu link: http://www.neptuneoyster.com/menu.html\\n\\nOverall, I hated the wait, but luckily the food made up for it. The staff was also terrific even in this busy, chaotic restaurant. The only downfall here is their noise level, don't expect a quiet restaurant. I almost felt like I had to yell sometimes to be heard, so come here and enjoy some fresh seafood and expect some loud conversation.

It's like you're in Portland, but you're not. The restaurant, yup - there are no windows, is a time capsule kind-of-place that feels more like a midwestern supper club than a Portland steakhouse. Add to the surreal mix - the lounge becomes a disco dancehall later in the evenings, complete with live music.\\n\\nWe went as a group celebrating the upcoming birth of a friends baby. It was meant to be a \\"man shower\\" so we went all-in and decided to eat at an old-timey steakhouse. It was a good move. From the moment we walked in, there was a kind of excitement for the place. It is different. And, as one of our table mates pointed out \\"Clyde's is not a Portland hipster restaurant by any stretch of the imagination . . . and that's a really good thing.\\"\\n\\nWith all of that said, Clyde's is struggling in some areas. As for the food - it was good. The salads were fresh and the steaks well-prepared and well grilled. It's good meat - but not great. \\n\\nThe wine list is not what you'd expect at a steakhouse and owes its selections more to a lower end pricing range. The bar offers a full range of cocktails, but as we experienced - does not always prepare the drinks you order. In fact, at the end of the evening a few of the guys at our table ordered \\"after dinner drinks\\" - to which the server commented that \\"they [Clyde's] don't have any after dinner drinks\\" per-se, but can make any number of cocktails. The guys all ordered Old Fashions - only to be told that the bartender didn't make Old Fashions and instead made Manhattans. The best part of the whole thing - the server didn't even blink. She merely put the drinks down on the table, explained the mix-up, and walked away. Nice! Oh, and by the way - we paid for the mix-up drinks.\\n\\nThe takeaway - Clyde's is a fun place to go if someone else is inviting you. It's unique and offers a dining experience you won't reproduce at too many places in the metro-area of Portland. It is not, however, a high-end steakhouse; and, if that is what you are looking for in your dining experience - there are far nicer (and better) places to select from in Portland."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Vermicelli bun with grilled shrimp (eat with the shell on for a crunch!) or fried tofu, or pho in general is pretty delcious.

I have been here quite a few times. Generally the food is very good, on the odd occasion when it is very busy the quality lacks. I wish they would take the time they needed to ensure the food is up to standard. I'd rather wait longer and have a better meal, than have the quality suffer. I took half a star off for this.\\n\\nThe Thai Iced tea they do is good but incredibly inconsistent, I find that most of the time it is far too sweet, but on the odd occasion they do get it right. I took half a star off for this - I am a big fan of Thai Iced tea, but theirs is often too sweet (I don't remember having it sweeter elsewhere, and I've had it a lot of other places - as well as make my own)\\n\\nThey leave the back door and serving window open most of the time, but they don't always keep a screen over them. Given the amount of flies in the spot where they are, this surprises me. I have seen flies enter their truck. I took a star off for this. T-loc's in Burnet keep their serving window screened off when they don't need it open - they even take orders with it closed, and only open it for when they need to take payment, or serve something. All food trucks should do this!\\n\\nThe last time I went I got the Pad Ka Pow and there was a hair in it. Short and black. I took a half star off for this.\\n\\nOverall, I give it 2.5 stars. Better attention to detail with the screens, taking their time when its busy, and toning down the sugar level on their tea (which, like I said, they do manage to do occasionally) I'd say this place is a solid 4.5-5 star food truck.

I haven't noticed the rude, arrogant hipster behavior from the counter staff that other reviewers have mentioned. However, it's kind of hard to get someone to take your order. If you stand at the little sign that says 'Order Sandwiches Here', no one will see you, and you have to wave at someone who's working in the kitchen area or the register or something, and they have to flag down whichever of their co-workers is supposed to be doing sandwiches.

We had read the yelp reviews, and decided that even though it was probably touristy, we'd give it a try because the food reviews were pretty great, and we were tourists. \\n\\nWe were immediately turned off when we walked in to the restaurant. We felt like we were a part of an assembly line, being pushed from one station to the next to check in with the hostess. We had 8:00 reservations, and he had requested a window seat. In order to get a window seat, they told us we had to wait for an hour. This was fine because we weren't in a hurry, but an hour? Even with reservations? So we went to the super crowded bar, and luckily found 2 random seats at the corner. We sat for about 10 minutes before I finally stood up to get the bartenders attention. He apologized, not sure why it took me standing up for him to come over to us, but either way we ordered some martinis which were made very well. While we were drinking them, we were seriously considering going somewhere else for dinner, but we decided to stick it out - my fiance had seen a man at the bar cutting his steak in a way that made him think it was extremely tough and not a good cut of meat. We got seated at a great table with a nice view of the city. Our waiter was nice. We ordered an inexpensive bottle of wine which wasn't very good - should have just splurged. We started with the calamari. We had read that we had to try it and it sounded great. When it came out, it was very doughy and not crispy at all. When the title has the word \\"crispy\\" in it, you expect it to be crispy. We sent it back and got a new one minutes later, that wasn't much different than the first. The sauce is delicious, but it was hard to overlook the soft bready calamari. We were pretty bummed at this point because we figured our dinner wouldn't be much better - which it wasn't. We split the iceburg wedge salad, which was extremely over dressed and the salad didn't look very fresh. My fiance had the 20 oz NY which was cooked well, but wasn't very exciting for $50. I had a special, which was the crab stuffed halibut. This was good - I was happy with it, but it wasn't amazing. Our server brought out a complimentary dessert since it was my birthday, which was very nice of him. \\n\\nI'm not sure why they get such good reviews on yelp - the view was great, but it was just that.

Pine State is so quintessentially Portland that nobody should visit without stopping by. It is also so quintessentially greasy that making it part of your routine puts you on the express train to an extra 50 lbs.\\n\\nThe how to guide:\\n-If you come here and you don't order something with biscuits, you're stupid. Biscuits is what they do. \\n-So the question is whether you want a biscuit sandwich or just biscuits with stuff on them. Both are perfectly valid choices, but expect greater quantity with a sandwich. If you're not that hungry, I'd recommend just doing biscuits and gravy (maybe with an egg on top). That way you get the two things that PSB is best at without all the extra stuff.\\n-If you're going with biscuits and gravy, you have to decide if you want sausage or mushroom gravy. If you're vegetarian, congratulations: the decision is made for you. But if you're not, this is a tough choice that I grapple with every time because they are honestly both great.\\n-If you decide on a sandwich, your decision isn't as difficult. Vegetarians should get the Regina, and omnivores should get the Reggie. Deluxe if you want an egg. Dump some hot sauce on top if that's your jam.\\n-Get some coffee and drink it.\\n\\nRelatively recently, they changed the procedure for getting your food, which seems to have smoothed over the whole operation. You now get a number when you order at the counter and food is brought to you (as opposed to before when they shouted your name from the kitchen and you went to the counter to pick it up).\\n\\nAnd if going to a restaurant isn't your jam (which, for the record, would be odd), they have a cart at the PSU Saturday Market on the South Park Blocks. \\n\\nThe moral of the story is: come here.

It was fairly crowded for a Saturday at 7:30 p.m. but the bartender was very attentive. Started off with their version of a margarita called Marguerite. It went down fast because it was damn good. That lemon salted syrup really made this cocktail outrageously good. Tried two each of the oysters, both delicious. The freshly grated horseradish was an excellent accent, just the right amount of light but dangerous heat. Everything was going swimmingly up to this point. Then a waitress asked if I would mind moving down to accommodate a party of three. Not a problem but instead of moving me to the center of the bar -- which would have been considerate since I was alone -- she moved me to the end of the bar, staring straight into a plant and the kitchen. She sensed my disappointment and tried to make small talk with me about the book I was reading. Turns out she's never read this author. So it was literally \\"small talk\\" about nothing. Weird. A mixed greens salad came next and for a mixed greens salad, it was pretty darn delicious. Just the right amount of dressing and a sprinkling of cheese. So far, so good. Then my entree came out. The bartender talked up the fish special: red snapper with fresh vegetables and a beurre blanc. This was a big disappointment. It just tasted all over the place and not distinctive at all. There was some sort of popcorn shrimp garnish -- totally strange. And the fish seemed overcooked. A meal that started off on such high really fell flat. Maybe just an off night in the kitchen.

The onion rings were tender yet crispy served with a perfectly zippy remoulade sauce. The Blue Max punch , a luscious libation of pineapple juice,  vodka, champagne,  ginger ale and Blue Curacao packs quite the punch. One is sufficient for a New Orleans party mood. For dinner we split Walter's Po'boy sandwich.  \\"Sandwich\\" does not do this creation justice; more like a meal for two or more instead of \\"sandwich\\". The lightly fried chicken breast was tossed in Louisiana Gold hot sauce, topped with crispy peppered bacon and pepper jack cheese served on warm crispy French bread with all the accoutrements befitting such a magnificent creation. Dessert was definitely not a necessity, except that beignets are an absolute must when partaking of New Orleans cuisine.

However, the guy in front of me ordered pork steak and the server pulled the pork steak from below the one that didn't look good. So, you guessed it, I ordered the pork steak and the server picked the one on top with the extra fatty/gristle. I immediately asked, \\"may I have a different steak please\\"?

Actually, Sakana Ya (now closed) used to have great ramen as well and this reminds me of the ramen I used to have there a bit.  \\n\\nOn the other hand I wasn't so impressed with the yakitori offerings.  It was nicely cooked and fresh and tasted fine.  My qualm was about the selections and price.  Selections are limited, though I understand that they are concerned about business.  If they were to offer all the exciting yakitori options like chicken skin, butt, entrails of all varieties (I particularly favor intestines, but heart/liver/gizzard all fine), and the rooster's crown among other things (see the Osaka episode on No Reservation for reference), then I would be very happy, but probably they would lose money.  Let's not even get into what pork yakitoris options are possible...a yakitori stand in Japan can easily offer a dozen things not found here!  Price was also (not THAT surprisingly) rather steep for what it is.  Bottom line is, good quality, but hard to fall in love with.  I'll stick with the noodles.  \\n\\nThere's other dishes and sushi is also available although not the focus.  This is in a strange location and now I don't live in Vinings anymore it's hard to make the trip just to come here (I would be distracted by the proximity of Tasty China to this place and go there instead).

After we waited for 30 minutes drinking bloody marys and mimosas me and my wife and our friends sat down and ordered. The waiter told us fabulous tales about how the Real Housewives of Atlanta actually ate and staged a fight at Murphy's, and how Usher came by one time and carefully arranged all his jewelry on the table in front of him before putting it back on. This seemed to annoy the waiter telling the story, but he should've totally bowed down and worshiped that dude on the spot. Usher is too good for that place and if they'd messed up his eggs like they messed up mine he would've told all of his cool friends and nobody cool would ever go to Murphy's again.

Last time was truly the last straw.  My husband and I were seated and ignored for 10 minutes.  Finally my husband tried to catch the eye of the waitress with a little waive.  She stuck her index finger up (more \\"talk to the hand\\" than \\"just a second\\"), but finally, a few minutes later a different waitress finally arrived.  The food arrived strangely out of sequence and with no explanation, and the service was just so lacking we left vowing that we will never visit that location again.  Having worked in the restaurant industry, I'm usually pretty forgiving (I get it; they're really busy today.  Maybe they're down a server, maybe they got an unexpected rush) but this happens every time we go to the Mio in the round.\\n\\nThe 185th location is the exact opposite.

On one side are people who actually enjoy real, authentic sushi. On the other side are people who might not even enjoy fish at all, but want to be able to say they love sushi. They'll order something which is filled with cream cheese, tempura bits, maybe some shredded carrot, and no fish whatsoever, then deep fried and called a \\"Dragon Sunshine Crunch Roll.\\" Or something. Whatever food comes between sake bombers, to these folks, is \\"sushi.\\"\\n\\nWhich is fine.  But the problem comes when a restaurant caters solely to one or the other, and it's not obvious which until you sit down and look at a menu. Someone who wants an exciting \\"fusion\\" sushi roll will be bored at a traditional sushi place, and someone who wants actual sushi (as I was last night) will be disappointed with Alpha.\\n\\nI debated my rating, since the seaweed salad, edamame, wild salmon and toro rolls and sashimi we got were actually very good, and the service was decent. But I thought I was going to a sushi place, and that wasn't the case.  Just ordering was an exercise in frustration. The menu was mostly \\"fusion\\" dishes, many of which had as much to do with sushi as a plate of spaghetti. We had to actually draw a picture of a maki roll, and ask if they could make one out of wild salmon. It wasn't on the menu; no maki rolls were. \\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of trying to order it became obvious that they had only a few types of fish on hand. No yellowtail, no eel, no roe of any kind, and certainly nothing unusual like sea urchin. They had very inventive fusion-esque combinations of things (Italian Spring Roll? Is SUSHI??), to appeal to the latter group of people, but nothing for the former group except one admittedly excellent sashimi offering.\\n\\nSo, if you're looking for a sake bomber or cocktail and some tasty sushi-related dishes, Alpha is a good choice.

My partner and I arrived with an out-of-town friend and were greeted by a mostly full room of patrons but, no staff.  A minute later, a server acknowledged us by yelling that he'd make a clean table for us.  Before that could happen, a group of 6 diners offered a portion of their unused table closer to the center of the space; we obliged. \\n\\nThe place was relatively small and clean with newly painted walls and some local-themed decor which added a nice touch.

Twelve minutes in and still, no water, no utensils, and no acknowledgment.  Another couple wandered in and were seated, their drink orders taken.

What a disappointment.\\n\\nI understand that good, if not great food, often requires patience.

The chips appear to be made in house, and are thicker than the standard fragile food service chips.  The salsa was of the cooked variety and served warm.  Both were great.  The guacamole was fresh, but lacked seasoning or other additions-- it was just some mashed up avocado which we ended up saving to add to the taquitos, since it was so bland on its own.   The caesar de arbol salad was excellent, as the arbol chiles gave the dressing a spicy zing.  The cold carrot soup was unremarkable and served far too cold.\\n\\nOur main course consisted of a sampling of numerous tacos, and they ranged from solid to great.  They are all served on fresh-made corn tortillas, and each comes with its own unique toppings.  The carnitas and ribeye tacos were stellar, and the oyster taco was also good.  Our least favorite was the mahi mahi, but it was still pretty good.  The tacos are a bit on the small size (I would want 3-4 as a full meal), but they are reasonably priced and can all be ordered a la carte, which is nice so you can try a variety of things.\\n\\nThe service was indifferent, but I expect that will change with time.   All in all, we had a very good first visit and are looking forward to going back, probably for a happy hour on the deck."},{"name":"Barkers Red Hots","address":"3000 Windy Hill Rd, Ste 128","city":"Marietta","stars":"4","text":"Not nearly as good as Big City Deli in Kennesaw! This place is actually quite pricey for what you get. The all beef hot dog is good, if you just want a classic dog. Nothing special, the hot sauce is pretty good that they put on the dog, its more of a hot relish than a sauce though. The owner and his wife are not very friendly or service oriented. They like to deal with one customer at a time and cook one hot dog at time. Even though I ordered a steamed dog thats already cooked, I had to wait 10 minutes for the guy who ordered 3 dogs food to get cooked. Speed of service is huge during the lunch hour.

Being 35 minutes early to meet friends, I put my name in to get a table; when one came up barely 15 minutes later, the host was more than happy to go ahead and seat me early so I could wait for my party.  (And sample a delicious warm coffee drink.)  Lots of places would have skipped over me and said \\"We can't seat you until your whole party's here,\\" so their graciousness was much appreciated. The chocolate doughnut was even better this time, though the cofee cake was just solid.  The baked apple with cheese and lardons was a little hard to navigate (it worked better once everything was cut up and reassmbled bite-by-bite), but yummy if a little oily.  However, with the main courses, we were in the stratosphere.  I ordered the \\"toad\\" breakfast, expecting a basic variation on English \\"Toad in the Hole\\"; I received a mini skillet loaded with baked eggs, cheese, and crispy, buttery bread that was beyond heavenly.  My friends ordered an omelet and Duck Duck Steak; both were immensely pleased.  (Special note for the PERFECTLY cooked, succulent duck.)  Their daughter enjoyed the bambino plate, which was plentiful for a little girl (scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuit). Best of all, the incredibly gracious and attentive server listened to every question the table had about ingredients and special dietary needs, and could not have been more accomodating or friendly.  (She had reddish hair and a nose ring; if you get her, you're in terrific hands.)  We even snagged a window seat this time!  Only minor caveat: the music (mostly 60' soul for the first hour) contributed to the noise level, which was pretty deafening; maybe some chipper cocktail jazz or 40's-50's style traditional pop might lower the din a tad.

This one however stands out from the rest in its strange elongated shape, which, while good for queuing, gives it a strange sort of feel, like a stretched and squished version of the standard. Nonetheless, and while this may seem surprising, the burritos (or burrito bowl, if you are into that sort of thing) ACTUALLY taste better than opposing places. Maybe the crew is especially hard working, maybe the elongated shape is more congenial to the burrito's essence - it is hard to say, but as it stands, this one is highly recommended."},{"name":"Tsuki Sushi Bar","address":"509 Abbott Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Today I stopped in for a bento box on a lunch break.

I make them myself, but I'm too lazy to do so. The  place  is clean, the staffs are all smiling and friendly, busy but remained  nice. \\nAbout the food...we had the BBQ chicken, and it tastes tender, juicy and well seasoned. Yummy. My daughter's usual order in any Viet restaurants is the Pork BBQ plate:  pork, 2 eggs, pickled veggies, tomatoes and cucumbers..Here they served  only 1 egg, but it's ok, because the food is good. I love their BBQs..well seasoned and less food color!  We  also got the Pho...We ordered the largest, but its not too large, as what were used to getting in comparison to Pho24 or PhoBac. Well, honestly, both Pho places  beat them on the soup. Its a little salty for me too, and there's not much in the soup, not even the veggies. If you want an extra broth (which is free from other places, like Pho24, if you ordered entrees) it's $1. here for about 2-3 oz, the size of their dipping bowls, smaller than rice bowls! Or you can order a large one the size of our soup meal order, for $3. We had to get the bigger one because the other was too small. Unless you ask for the condiments, and know what you want, there's none on the table. They have cloth napkins with utensils , no paper napkins. One more thing, the 2 rice dishes we ordered came in when were about to get done with  soup, and as I was eating the last bite of my papaya salad. \\"Sorry, the kitchen made them to go, I don't know why, so we're cooking you another one\\" per our server,  when I followed up on our order 10-15 minutes prior to the serving of these BBQ plates. We  have a toddler with us, so it's not easy to entertain her for almost an hour of waiting... Lucky me, I know our baby well that she rarely cries whenever, or wherever...we got her used to going out I guess, thankfully \\n Finally, the papaya salad. The reason why we went here in the first place...I was dissappointed. its sweet, no spice at all, and It didn't taste close to the Vietnamese papaya salad I know.  It tastes good, for a salad, but its far from an authentic one that I was craving for. There's very minimal, thin shreds of papaya, more of the apple slices, peanuts and cucumbers. I can't taste the lime if there's any, no chili,  or garlic. Viet papaya salads are supposed to be sweet, sour and a little spicy. \\nIn the end, they gave us a free dessert which made my older daughter smile, and my family surely ate it well: mocca coffee ice cream with 3 squares of the mocca cakes, and its really delicious. I think because of the food delay.. I ate here before but i didnt get a free dessert. Thanks to them anyways. And the staffs were apologetic , which, was really just fine with us since our little one's not crying anyways. \\nOverall, I'm not hating this place, nor their food. The place is clean but I hope they'll avoid spraying the tables with cleaners next time when people are eating because it went through my nose when they did it to the table beside us, just behind my toddler. And I hope they will not forget orders, just in case, specially if there are small children or else, it'll really gonna end up as super fast to-go!\\nThe food is well prepared, the tables are nice and the staffs are hard workers and friendly. It's just that, the papaya salad was not mostly papaya, rice is too broken, the cleaning spray and the delayed food were the bumps. And if it just soup your after, the Pho places nearby are better and cheaper.

In the end they did remove it from the bill without me asking \\"because you weren't happy\\", which was a mildly backhanded way to go about it.

Came here for the opening time on Sunday 6/8/14. The rumors are true (thank god I'm an avid Yelp! reader and took the advice of others!) if you do not want a wait you MUST get here before it opens and wait for the first seating or else your wait will be 2+ hours. (They do not take reservations.) On Sunday it opens at 11:30 and we were in line around 11:15 and had about 10-12 people ahead of us. Luckily we made it in the first wave of seating as this place is small. They have about 5 -7 (not sure) tables that seat 6 each and you may sit with others at your table as they try to fill it as much as possible due to the wait. They also have about 10-12 bar seats also. I was sitting right by the door and before our appetizers even came out people kept coming in trying to get a seat and were being told that at this time the wait was around 2 hours and 45 minutes at this point and if they wanted to wait they would call them when their table was ready. Now, is all this worth it? YES. YES. YES. They give you a menu you check off of what oysters they have available and you choose which ones and how many you'd like. They're about $3-$5 a piece with some of the raw bar being $20 a PIECE. Best oysters I've ever had. So fresh. Then I ordered the infamous hot lobster roll. SO good. I saw a few people order the cold but from what I've heard hot is the only way to go. HUGE chunks of lobster and dripping in butter in the best way possible. Well worth the $27. It comes with fries on the side,  they were good but I was so full I barely ate them. Service was very good too. If you're a seafood lover please try this place and get here early!

It took a half hour just to get our check despite our best efforts (from a random bus boy no less, not even our waitress), making us late for our concert and generally unhappy (we didn't miss the headliner thank goodness, but if we did there would have been hell to pay!). The waitress wouldn't even look at us while we walked out. Cool.\\n\\nAnd the kicker: they added 18% gratuity to the check total (we were planning on tipping only 8-10%ish). Obviously they didn't have to pay attention to us after dropping off the food because of that. WTF? Also, I'm pretty sure once they knew we had a 'coupon' they decided not to continue with the high level of service we had upon arrival (I think there's a Groupon for Mantra out now? But hello, a gift cert is NOT a coupon, nor should any kind of coupon or discount allow for poor service anyways!)\\n\\nSide note: the food was generally pretty good, I had a shrimp biryani ($20) that was very flavorful and my dining companion had the veggie kofta balls ($15) which were saucy and delicious and came with a side of rice. Each of us got just the right amount to fill us up (not really enough for any leftovers), but I don't think I would have been as happy were I to be paying full price... $20 for one serving of rice, albeit tasty rice, isn't really my style, especially when I've had just as good elsewhere for cheaper.\\n\\nSo in sum: food decent but overpriced, service either awesome or awful (we got most of the awful).

The fries I got were definitely not truffle fries (and even as regular fries, they weren't particularly great). The sandwich was alright, but not worth the $16 price tag in my opinion. It was a bit too salty for my taste and I ended up taking off most of the meat. Past items I've ordered here have ranged from \\"mildly disappointing\\" to \\"kinda good.\\"\\n\\nThere were a number of issues with the service as well - the waitress we had was honestly pretty grouchy. One person in our party was brought the wrong drink order, and she seemed annoyed that he actually wanted to be brought the drink he ordered. She also disappeared about halfway through the night, leading to us having to flag down another waitress after about 30 minutes to go find her and bring us our check. \\n\\nAtmosphere in here is your typical Boston bar. Overall, Clerys is an option if you want someplace casual near Back Bay with a basic pub food menu and decent drink selection, but don't expect to be blown away (and cross your fingers that you have better luck with the service than what we had... which was pretty darn awful)."},{"name":"Monica's Mercato","address":"130 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped here after a long, hot, humid day on The Freedom Trail.

I really wanted to like this place as it's conveniently located close to home, but Yakitori Jinbei left a lot to be desired. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. The broth was good enough, but really got me is how little was included with the ramen - just broth, noodles, cabbage (why cabbage?), and 2 pieces of pork - all for the low price of $13. Adding an egg was $2 extra and it was hard boiled, not soft boiled. There's usually a lot more included with a basic Tonkotsu ramen dish that adds complexity to the dish. Egg is usually included in the price. Also, while the pork was decent tasting, it wasn't the amazing melt-in-your-mouth pork that I associate with good ramen. \\n\\nI did try a few pieces of the yakitori.

I've gotten take-out from them several times and it was a good experience each time. The store has two small tables and counter space for customers, with an open kitchen and a small sushi bar. The people who work there are friendly - so naturally, the service is very good. So with all that out of way, I'll rant about the food, haha.\\n\\nTo break it down, their American Chinese is definitely above average. You can definitely tell by their fried rice, which is much better than I've had at other places. It's lighter, softer, and made with a good balance of vegetables. The appetizers they offer are good, but it might be towards a matter of taste. For example, the crab rangoons are just barely overpowered by minced green onion in the filling. But compared to how some places might add sugar, I'm perfectly happy with this flourish of sorts.\\n\\nNow, with their Japanese fare - Well,  my feelings are mixed. I have yet to try most of the appetizers or the entrees from the kitchen, I do go for a bit of their sushi, While the miso soup and some of the rolls weren't very good, I really -really- enjoyed their version of a chirashi-don, which is typically an assortment of raw fish on a bed of sushi rice.\\n\\nI've had chirashi all over town because you just can't go wrong with it. And while Kanji King House's isn't the biggest or most filling, it's arguably the best for a place in Quincy. To start off, it's definitely at the lowest price you can find it - just beating out the B-cafe in North Quincy by some change. It's just barely filling though, but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for it in quality AND presentation.\\n\\nTheir chirashi is set up for bento-style takeout, which is unique for the restaurants in the area. The centerpiece a small bed of sushi rice with a little nori and sesame topping and a sweet shrimp prepared two ways. The body is raw sashimi, and the head, legs, and tamale are lightly battered and crisply fried. No other place does this for chirashi - so it's both unusual but very tasty, haha. And then for the sides, miso soup, greens, and raw fish are prepared by the chef. The greens can be salad or edamame, and the fish is usually carefully dressed and presented with shredded carrot, radish, pickled daikon, green onion, and different types of delicate pepper paste. The assortment of fish may change on the day you order it, but I think the variety's a nice touch. \\n\\nSo as you can see, I'm a big fan of that ONE dish, haha.  I'll have to try their nigiri sushi though, as well as some of their specialty rolls. And if I'm up to it, maybe something along the lines of their Japanese style fried pork cutlets or pan tossed noodles. But for the time being, Kanji King House is definitely worth checking out if you're feeling some American Chinese, or if you're just a wee bit adventurous, their take on Japanese."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I actually tried this at the farmers market.

Disappointingly average.  The mussels were a little chewy, and the flavor was average at best.  The broth was light, which was refreshing, but this was not a favorite.  Some of the mussels were not cleaned properly.  =(\\n\\nLobster Spring Roll - Spicy Mayonnaise and Soy-Orange Dipping Sauce $16.  Not recommended.  The lobster roll portion was small-ish for the price and although the flavors were good, there are better apps to be ordered...such as:\\n\\nJumbo Lump Crab Cake - Grilled Zellwood Corn Relish and Ancho Chili Sauce $15.  Pretty tasty . The lump crab portion was generous and the breading on the crab cake was perfect.  The relish and sauce was delicious and did not mask the flavor of the crab.\\n\\nRhode Island Calamari - pepperoncini relish, tomato coulis, and extra virgin olive oil $13.  Average at best.  We had better, like at Cat Cora's Kouzzina.  Skip, if you are looking for something special.\\n\\nEntrees\\nSurf and Turf - twin medallions of filet mignon, lobster tail, potato gratin, broccolini, and shallot-red wine butter $59.  \\n\\nThe lobster tail was unexpectedly delicious.  5 stars.  It didn't look that great b/c when it came it was slightly pale and looked kinda overcooked.  But 3 out of 4 of us ordered this, and all of us agreed that it was better than before and cooked perfectly.  The meat was tender rather than chewy.  The flavor was mildly sweet.  With butter and a tiny splash of lemon, it was heaven.  Ahhhh.  I could have one right now =)\\n\\nThe filet used to come in medallions.  Recently, I've noticed that they will give you an actual piece of the filet.  We ordered all of our filet medium rare and they came medium to medium rare.  The quality of the filet was above average but not excellent.  The steaks were on average, 3.5.  We've had better steak (on Disney property & elsewhere), but whose to argue with surf and turf?  4.5 stars overall for this dish.\\n\\nSteamed Whole Maine Lobster - Drawn Butter, Potato Gratin, and Asparagus $58.\\n\\nDisney claims that the whole lobster is flown in fresh.  I believe it.  YUM.  Even better than the last time I ordered it.  (knuckles were chewy the last time I ordered it.)  My dad ordered this, and I had many bites =)  The flavor was fresh and sweeter than the lobster tail on the surf and turf.  Just really great lobster, with drawn butter.  It comes with potatoes--but who cares?!  Just eat the big ole' whole lobster.  YUM.  Cooked perfectly.   Yum.  5 stars.\\n\\nDesserts\\n\\nAlmond crusted cheesecake.  I've heard raves and raves about this but honestly, I hated it.  The cheesecake itself was great, but almond crusting itself was sugared/candied and overly sweetened.  So, like every dessert at Disney, the entire thing just ended up being overly sweet.\\n\\nDrinks\\nWe ordered strawberry & mango \\"smoothies.\\" Be warned, these are not fruit blended type of smoothies.  More like fruit flavoring with milk.  So my strawberry smoothie was more like thickened strawberry milk.  Not bad, but not what I was expecting.\\n\\nOverall---Narccoossee's and the Grand Floridian is an awesome experience, especially if you time it to come here during the fireworks (which you can see from your table, music piped in).  It is a great dining experience.  \\n\\nHowever, beware the amount of tip you'll have to dole out after you order everything you are entitled to on the dining plan.  We had a bit of sticker shock when we realized how much tip you add on top of a $400 bill.

I say \\"Mexican\\" in quotes because besides the tortilla chips and salsa, everything else on the menu is unMexican.  They have tacos, but it's a Cheeseburger taco or a Chicken Philly, etc.  It's a fun menu and very good. One of our vendors told us about the chips and how addictive they are... and it's true, they put some kind of seasoning (she said Crack) but it's something that is amazing.... so make sure you get the chips salsa/guac combo.  Just disappointing they don't offer complimentary chips and sauce.  I got the Korean BBQ pork taco... and it's good, so make sure you don't pass that up.  Fiesta chicken taco was ok. Spicy tilapia taco a \\"must\\" along with the Korean pork.  We also got some of the margaritas, but honestly those are big rip off since they pack the glass with ice and if you tell them less ice they just put more juice because \\"it's state law for an exact pour\\" c'mon man... hook a brotha up.

Music blasting and just a lively vibe that extended out onto the street and this was on a Sunday. That took me off guard and I was instantly intrigued. So I turned off the highway a little too abruptly for my liking and pulled into The Park on South Lamar. The place has a decently sized indoor and outdoor area. I realized a World Cup game was on so I sat at the bar and checked out the beer menu. I wanted something that was local and similar to a blue moon. The bartender (Shout out to Misty!) recommended the Circle Blur. After having a taste I was satisfied. Misty was awesome she bought me my first round. I also got a taste of some hot pink colored drink - not sure what it was but it was tasty...and hot pink! I sat back relaxed and watched the soccer game. The crowd is friendly I chit chatted with a few people around me. \\n\\nOf course, at this point my phone is about to die. Being from out of state I needed my phone to tell me how to get back to my hotel. No one at the inside bar had a charger so it was suggested to me that I ask the outside bar. Sarina was so so so helpful in helping me find an iPhone 4 charger. Thank you!! As I sat outside I decided that I would order some food as it was getting close to dinner time.  I ordered Mahi Mahi Tacos with that I was able to pick two sides so I picked seasoned veggies and garlic fries. The seasoned veggies, in my opinion could have been more \\"seasoned.\\" The tacos were good... nothing spectacular though. I would have given The Park on South Lamar three stars, but because the customer service was excellent I shall give them another star.

We put our names on the list at around 12:30ish, and were seated a little after 1:30pm.  \\nWe ordered the Cast Iron Frittata, the fried egg & cheddar biscuit with fried chicken, the bim bop bacon & eggs, and the whole toad.\\nThe Fried Egg & Cheddar Biscuit with fried chicken was the first dish to arrive.  For any non-cheese eaters like myself, this dish can easily be made without cheese, since they just put a slice of cheddar on the biscuit.  Unfortunately, I didn't  realize this at the time (the name of the dish is kind of misleading), so I didn't eat any of the dish.  My friends seems to enjoy it though.  The egg had a nice runny yolk and the biscuit and chicken came out steaming hot.\\nNext, came the cast iron frittata.  This had nettles. roasted asparagus. caramelized onion, and salsa verde.  We requested the cheese on the side (I believe it's supposed to be fontina).  It was totally delicious and very satisfying.  Great texture and the various veggies really added to the dish.  This was my favorite dish of the meal.\\nThen we had the Bim Bop Bacon & Eggs.  This come out in a hot stone bowl (like the korean dish bibimbap).  Everything is stirred up, so you get soft bacon, runny eggs, and crispy rice all mixed up.  So tasty.  Also very filling.  It's bigger than it looks!\\nFinally, the Whole Toad.  This is a baked egg bread pudding, which comes with even more bread.  Carbs on carbs.  No problemo.  Except... is there cheese in this bread pudding?  I don't know, but I wasn't particularly fond of this dish.  \\nAs a drink, I ordered \\"The Driver's Seat\\" which is a non-alcoholic drink with earl grey syrup, mint, and lime juice.  Sadly I didn't get any hints of earl grey, as the lime was very overpowering.  But the drink was refreshing and did go well with brunch.  My friends both ordered orange juice, which is freshly squeezed, but comes in a tiny glass (maybe 6oz?), so it's a little overpriced.\\nWe considered ordering a sweet dish, but after these four plates came out, we were so stuffed, we called it quits.

I decided to meet my friend here for dinner, and arrived a little early, maybe 7:20pm on a Tuesday night. I was going to walk inside and wait for her, then stopped abruptly.\\n\\nCompletely empty.\\n\\nI checked to see if they were open. Definitely open. I made awkward eye contact with a sole worker inside several times while I waited outside. I heard him clapping and wiping the glass on the door with Windex. Anything to keep him from the monotony of the lack of customers...\\n\\nFinally, my friend and her husband arrived ten minutes later and we still decided to give Seven Hens a chance. Yup, still empty. Walking inside, the sole worker greeted us. He was a little abrasive, borderline rude, but was nice enough to suggest the most popular signature schnitzel options, as none of us had been there before. We each ordered his top three suggestions in the three different schnitzel styles:\\n\\nCajun BBQ (American) schnitzel salad\\nChipotle Cilantro (Mexican) schnitzel platter, and \\nGinger Teriyaki (Chinese) schnitzel wrap with sweet potato fries\\n\\nThere were seasoning salt shakers to use on your schnitzel in all the different flavors. I thought it was kind of pointless... Since aren't you already using the same sauce on your schnitzel? Why would you mix any of the flavors together? So we accepted the challenge of mixing flavors, which was pretty interesting.\\n\\nThe schnitzel was mighty tasty! Reminded me of Asian fried tonkatsu. My salad was literally just the chopped schnitzel atop greens. The Cajun BBQ dipping sauce came on the side.\\n\\nMaking it a meal (sweet potato fries and a drink) by adding $2.50 isn't the BEST deal, as you only get a handful of fries, but the fries are hot and crispy with some light seasoning. The Cole slaw was a little, which was a little off putting, but overall the flavors were pretty good, if you just ignore the sourness...\\n\\nAfter we ordered and started eating, another family came in to eat, and a couple people ordered to go.

I was simply amazed at how much better the food tasted.  I had a spicy chicken, and was thrilled to see that they cook everything fresh to order.  Halfway back I stop at another and get the same thing.  Again perfectly delicious.  I get to Portland and I decide to go again to the Wendy's in Clackamas.  What a disaster that was.  To start, there was some young girl that looked like she was in high school and she could care less about having to be there working.  She sighed when I walked up to the counter and in a completely obvious tone - the kind that tells you that your bothering them to have to take your order - she takes my order.  I saw the new baked sweet potato and thought I would order one with my spicy chicken.  The chicken again was perfect but when I opened the lid to the potato and thought it had to be a joke.  For a split second I thought I was on one of those hidden camera shows.  I never take or send food back because I just don't want to bother with it.  If somethings wrong then I will just go order another one or I'll just go somewhere else.  However, I just could not get over how this thing looked.  I don't even know how to describe it.  I wish I had had my phone with me to take a picture so I could post it and send it to the corporate offices.  I decided I would take it up to the counter and ask if this is how they were suppose to look.  It looked like someone had grabbed it with both hands and pinched their fingers together to make this smashed sweet potato that was completely dried out except for about two spoonfuls right in the middle of the potato.  The entire edge of the opening had a black burnt ring al the way around it and the bottom was burnt too.  Seriously, it looked hideous. The manager came over and her first response was that they didn't have anymore for one hour, then she looked at it and said she was sorry.  I said I didn't want anything other than to know if this is what they were suppose to look like.  She said yes.  I asked, even with the burnt ring around the potato?  Both the manager and the girl cashier said yes, that is what they look like.  I took my potato and didn't even bother to taste it. I ended up going up there and ordering a single after I ate the spicy chicken.  They didn't even bother to offer me a discount for the bad potato (I wouldn't have accepted anything from them but it would have been nice to have them at least ask).  The single was delicious too.  After I was done and leaving not one single person said good bye or how was your meal.  The irritating part was that I could hear them laughing and having fun in the back of the kitchen.  I normally never write reviews but I thought I better take the time to do this one.  Oh, and by the way.  On monday (this happened on Sunday night 5/20/12) I went to a different Wendy's and just ordered the sweet baked potato,  WOW, it looked just the picture advertisement and it was delicious.  The cinnamon butter takes a little getting use to, I would recommend getting the regular butter.

But if those two were in the ring together for fight night, I have a feeling that Magnolia Caf√© would win, but it would go to 10 rounds.  Having said that, the reason I do prefer Magnolia is that their food selections are a bit more spicy and varied.  Their Migas have an incredible hangover relieving additive that always brings me back to life after a long evening of indulgence.  I just recently noticed that they make the Migas with \\"Love Butter,\\" that's a mix of butter, garlic and serranos!  Now that's creativity you won't find at Kerby.

When the manager came out and offered to remove the sandwich from the bill, we insisted that it wasn't necessary- we just felt that they might appreciate feedback from their customers.  The manager's demeanor became contentious with a defensive comment about how the moth was not entirely their fault and offering to take my coffee off of the bill, too.

We arrived at 5:15 and walked in to find out they open at 5:30. Embarrassed by our awkward earliness as no one else was there save a few contractors, designers and other industrious types, we found ourselves... warmly greeted... invited in as if by friends, as if a gorilla had taken a stray kitten into it's loving arms. \\n\\n  Although the place was empty, they were not ready to seat us yet, so we patiently waited. During the wait we were brought some bread, a kind of Pon De Queso, and it came with a dipping sauce like butter but tastier, we were hungry, it was addictive and it was a struggle to quit but we had to save room for the meats to come. Time passed, and so did 5:30 but the Chima team was still not ready to seat. We took into account the infantile stage of the place and maintained our patience, we WANTED to give Chima a real chance, we were ready to find something new and wonderful. \\n\\n  The decor of the place was extravagant, the bar elegant, the waitstaff was lookin sharp and ready. So finally... at almost six o'clock, we were being seated... and it was a joyous affair as we breezed by the immense salad bar, my curiosity was  immediately aroused, I had to go back for a closer inspection. The moment the hostess showed us our table I put my coat down and made a U-Turn for the salad bar.\\n\\n  The Chima salad bar, wow. Grandiose and truly a spectacle on it's own, if I ever were to pay $25 for an all you can eat salad bar I believe this would be the one. Delicious cheeses, breads, pastas, amazing soups, and so much more. A delicious spectacle indeed. \\n\\n  After a full on expedition at the salad bar, we returned to our seats, where I noticed, there is a window into the kitchen where the meats are being prepared.... I liked that, thought it was a nice little touch. I will say that I had many servings of salad and the Alcatra (top sirloin) I will refrain from reviewing the rest of the meats.  Gas grilling is not the way nature intended, it's not the way meats were being cooked when we first learned to control fire. Gas can not produce the taste our ancestries have recognized throughout the millenia.\\n\\n  You could tell that the meats were very high quality, I clearly taste that they are as good as they can be without that classic element stolen from the Gods.\\n \\n  The service was over the top but still relaxed, friendly and very attentive, the way it's supposed to be.\\n\\nOver all, I would go back for the salad bar but I urge Chima, who is trying to compete with giants, to bring real fire to the meats. It will make all the difference in the world.\\n\\nBon Apptit fellow diners."},{"name":"Wild Wood Bakehouse","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Really enjoy coming here.

Flour lived up to the hype. Myself and a friend went around 9:40 on Sunday morning. It was not as crowded as I expected, but there were still about a dozen people in line and all the tables were full. However, Flour is incredibly efficient in handling of the line. We ordered, paid, and received our food in about 15 minutes. Staff was very upbeat and friendly. Amazingly, we were able to find two seats.\\n\\nFor a drink, I ordered a soy milk Spiced Chai Latte. It was the perfect temperature and not too sweet, so it was a great compliment to the pastries. To start, I had the breakfast egg sandwich with bacon. It has an egg souffl√©, bacon, roasted tomatoes, arugula, and dijonaise served on a focaccia roll. It was absolutely outstanding. No one piece of the filling overpowered any of the others and they all meshed brilliantly. The roll also held up surprisingly well to the filling.\\n\\nI also had a bite of the Boston Creme Pie. With a hint of coffee, Flour adds a unique twist to this classic. The layers were very light and the amount of chocolate flavor was perfect to accentuate the other components. It was excellent and on par with the original served at the Omni Parker House.\\n\\nAnd, finally, of course, I had the famed Sticky Bun. It actually exceeded my expectations. Some sticky buns are so sweet that all you can taste is sugar. Flour's has a perfect combination of the three major flavors in their sticky bun: the dough, the \\"goo\\", and the pecan. The dough is almost like a brioche, with lots of butter and an elastic texture. This would delicious by itself and is a perfect medium for the rest of the bun. The bun was covered in a generous amount of what Joanne Chang calls the \\"goo\\", rich caramel-like sauce that really puts the \\"sticky\\" in sticky bun. Finally, the bun is infused with chopped pecans to give it a nice nutty flavor to offset all of the sugary goodness. This is a truly fantastic pastry.\\n\\nTo be honest, I would try every single item on Flour's menu. I plan to make this place a regular destination of mine.

What we ordered was fair, but in truth I've had better and expected any chef pretentious enough to stop making a dish just celebrated as one of the best things our little city has to offer would have to be spectacular.  Instead they failed to take off the strawberries at my friend's request from his order due to a food allergy.  We would have said something, but they had already comped the meals due to various complaints of two other tables that had been eating when we got there and we felt bad for them.  Overall it seemed as though they had good intentions, but had no idea how a restaurant should be run.\\n\\nI hope they make it because everyone who took care of us seemed really nice, and I hope part of their success would include capitalizing on any other publicity they get should there ever come a chance like that again.

Even my Indian friends love this place - one of them came here 10 times in the first 2 weeks Teji's on Guadalupe just opened.\\n\\nEvery time I leave Teji's, I notice my mood lifts exponentially and that almost everything in the world seems right. My tummy is warm and joyfully filled. What's the aftertaste? Complete satisfaction, an eagerness to return, and great memories of times spent with friends over delicious food. I think all restaurants should leave their customers feeling that way - don't you think so too? \\n\\nToday, I want to talk about other reviewers, how Teji's can benefit you, and my favorite things to order at Teji's.\\n\\nSome of the reviews talk about the Round Rock location. I think it's great the reviewers are trying to anchor in past experiences with the same restaurant with this Guadalupe Teji's, but please keep in mind that this Austin location is located near the UT Austin campus. I don' think it's a fair comparison. I mean realistically - how many reviewers, at least the ones living near Guadalupe, are willing to drive to another city to get dinner every week? Instead, Teji's on Guadalupe should be compared to restaurants within a 10-15 minute driving distance.\\n\\nTeji's feels like home away from home. For a reasonably priced $8-14, you can order a delicious combo that includes everything from naan, a side of Indian vegetable curry, your choice of meat (or vegetarian) curry, and a side of Indian dessert. Their portions of biryani (a rice-based dish) are enough to feed two people. Also, the customer service is something good enough to tell stories about.\\n\\nWhenever I'm here, I feel like I'm being treated like royalty. Compared to a eating on campus or at other local restaurants, they give you silverware. This means a sturdy plate, heavy knives and forks, and a large sized napkin. If you come here during the summer, there's less customers so it's easier to talk to the waiters and managers. If you come during the school year, you'll notice there's sometimes even a short wait at lunch or dinner times.\\n\\nBut the wait at Teji's is always worth it. Some of the best things in life require patience and this happens to be one of them. Every time I come here, my food is steaming hot and fresh. My tongue waters when I imagine their chicken tikka masala or lamb curry combo.\\n\\nBack to the benefits. You'll be extremely full, or two-meals worth of fullness (if you're female) and just right (if you're male) for ordering one of their fairly priced combos or biryani dishes. Their iced water is delicious and fresh, so if you're thirsty, they generously offer you their resources. The menu is super easy to order from. The chairs and atmosphere is warm, graceful, and relaxing. I've never ever been hurried out the door. I've taken different friends here on more than five separate occasions and each time not only do they love the food too, but I'm reminded at what a great place Teji's is for having deep conversations or catching up.\\n\\nI love talking with the people who work here. Elizabeth, the manager, is always extremely nice and welcoming to everyone she meets. For example, she's always there for me when I need surprise recommendations (such as the chicken 65 or chocolate lassi). She's extremely hard working and sometimes puts in even 80 hours a week (enough to make certain investment bankers proud)! Elizabeth is also very personable and charismatic. She knows how to make customers laugh, open their true personalities, and honestly does her best to get feedback from customers on how to improve.\\n\\nJust the other night, on July 4th, I overheard a few conversations Elizabeth had with her colleagues and also customers. To her colleagues, she made them free chocolate lassi's as a way to thank them for their hard work. She knows every employee by name and does her best to direct them - such as instructing them on how to treat customers. To the customers, she got them seated right away even though not all of their friends had showed up. Not only did she shake hands with them, ask them for feedback, but she also thanked them for giving her and Teji's an opportunity to serve great food and service.\\n\\nAside from really great customer service, Elizabeth has some really cool tattoos - reminding you that this is the beautiful Austin and there's no other place like it. \\n\\nAt Teji's, I've tried the lamb combo (a go to on any day), the chicken tikka masala (great for first time Indian food testers), chicken 65 (better than any fast food chicken),  mango lassi (slightly sweet, but still good) , lamb biryani, and wrap.\\n\\nThis is my go to place around UT Austin.\\n\\nP.S.

Lately I've come to find this is the case at other Chipotle locations.  With the economy in the can I see a lot of restaurants cutting back on their portions.  I really do love the carnitas burrito but don't expect to get carnitas in every bite.  The pre-portioned bag of chips is a bit skimpy as well.  Though there were plenty to go with my guacamole.

My husband and I took the day off and headed to CMA. We've lived in Columbus for 8.5 years, and this was only our 2nd trip to the museum. On our drive, I could not remember why we hadn't been back in nearly 8 years. Even though I don't plan to wait another 8 to return, I do remember now why we didn't rush our 2nd visit. CMA is so tiny!  Having lived in Cleveland from 1996 through 2005 and having been lucky enough to visit art museums in New York, Austin, and San Francisco, I may be spoiled, but I expect more from a city the size of Columbus. I am one of those people that read everything, and I still got through all of the galleries in 60 minutes. My husband, a non museum reader, was through in 20. Don't get me wrong!  The art is great with many well known artists. I just left wanting more. \\n\\nThere is plenty of seating in the galleries that can be utilized for sitting and soaking it all in and even a few hands on opportunities. We did not explore the activities on the first floor so I can't evaluate those. Maybe next time. \\n\\nWe paid $24.00 for two of us. I don't mind the cost. I think of it as a donation. I can, however, see how cost could be a deterrent for a large family. Parking, on the other hand, is free!\\n\\nWould I recommend CMA to a friend?  It depends.

Seems like the cook changed recently - quality of some dishes went downhill in the past few weeks.\\n\\nPros: Been there a couple of times and the servers are always very attentive, even if you sit on the patio. Prices are not outrageous for the area and the type of restaurant it is. Not many alternatives left in the area. Quite a few draft beer selections, and a lot of creative martinis and highballs that the bar makes fairly quickly. Bathrooms are always clean, love their soap scent there. Manager is very friendly, always comes by each table to ask how the food has been, always sharply dressed.\\n\\nCons: Menu always changes every 6 months or so, usually the good stuff goes for some reason. Food quality degraded a bit recently. Gets a little loud inside, and the patio is not the most private and cozy, due to the area it is in - heavy vehicle traffic and some shady characters always wandering by."},{"name":"Cafe Mineiro","address":"8204 Crystal Clear Ln, Ste 1700","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Did the all you can eat \\"rodizio style\\" for $24.95- very nice! I have been to Texas de Brazil and for less than half the price of that, you really can't complain.

Very accommodating servers- I like my meats medium well and my family medium, and they brought both to the table.  However, the salad bar is not as good as the one in Texas de Brazil (but keep in mind the price difference) contained some mayonnaise based salads, basic vegetables, and a couple deli meats/ cheeses. Then again, you don't come to this place for the salad you come for the meat! The buffet bar was nice- rice and beans, ox tail, fried yuca, really good fried bananas, some fried shrimp, etc.  MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT: hidden charge! The popsicles are $4-4.50 each.

If you've ever heard of sweetbreads, you would know that it is literally the most misleading food name ever, as sweetbreads are actually the thymus glands and pancreas of calf or lamb.

This is much more inline with reality. \\n\\nThe food was mostly well prepared and of decent quantity. The fish was fresh, although overdone. The steak was quite underdone, coming out practically Blue when ordered medium-rare (priced at $39 for the small filet). Speaking of the beef, my children chose the beef skewers off of the children's menu, only to be told that they were all out. To be clear, they weren't out of beef as we were able to order them the fillet off the adult menu as a substitute (although was not offered any discount - I didn't really expect an insane discount, but there had be some middle ground between a children's steak skewers meal and a $39 fillet). \\n\\nService was slow and forgetful.

But, due to a totally rude and incompetent waiter, I have to give a 1. BEWARE OF KELVYN!\\n\\nI arrived at Redbones around 6ish on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday sporting a group of 7. We had an approximate 20-30 minute wait (NBD), and were then seated with a seemingly normal waiter named Kelvyn. Everything was TOTALLY fine until the bill came...\\n\\nThe bill came out to $136, not including gratuity. My friends and I happen to be decent tippers, so planned on giving a tip of $27, for a total of $163. We also didn't want the birthday boy to pay, so here is the breakdown of the money that was thrown on the table:\\n\\nFriend 1: $20 \\nFriend 2: $20\\nFriend 3: $16 \\nFriend 4: $43 \\nMyself and my boyfriend: $55 \\n\\nThis total came to $154 - $9 short of where we needed to be. Friend 4 offered to take their money back and put the rest on their card. I counted out the $43 and gave it back to them, changing the cash total to $111. The total that should therefore have been put on his card was $25, but instead, when the waiter came back, my friend was charged $45. \\n\\nI had everyone at the table double check their wallets to see how much they put down, and I had friend 4 check to see that I correctly gave them $43 and not $63 back. All checked out. We then called Kelvyn over to the table to notify him that he seemed to be short $20. Instead of offering an apology, or even going back to check, he IMMEDIATELY responded with the following:\\n\\nKelvyn: No, there was $91. I counted it twice, and I had another waitress confirm, so it seems that the math is right. So what's the problem (snarkily), you trying to figure out the tip? \\n\\nI tried to politely respond that I too had counted the money several times and, being a former bank teller, I knew for a fact that there was $111 in the bill. Kelvyn did not seem to care, and again did not offer to check and walked away. The fact that he came right out of the gate saying that there was $91 in the bill, and he had another person confirm (why?) seemed incredibly suspicious to me. I think he pocketed that $20. \\n\\nMEANWHILE, I have neglected to mention that although we had a table of 7, we received 6 plates, 6 sets of silverware, and 6 pieces of cornbread. So, as it would appear, Kelvyn couldn't count correctly from the start. \\n\\nI'd also like to note that we still tipped Kelvyn 15%, because although we were bamboozled, we aren't jerks.\\n\\nAlso, on the way out, we notified the host that we were shorted this money and he too seemed not to care, and offered no apology or assistance. \\n\\nWhile the food is undeniably good at Redbones, our terrible experience with Kelvyn convinced us that we will not be going back.

OK - so we came at 8:30.  One person in our party had car trouble and hadn't arrived.   We were able to get cocktails but when we told them we were ready to order and were not going to wait for the late person they told us that they won't put our orders in until the other person arrives!  We had way too much time of nothing but our cocktails and bread.\\n     Finally, an hour or more after we are seated, our food comes out - but no pacing.  My two appetizers are plopped in front of me at the same time.  My cocktail (the Van Cleef very yummy but powerful) had long ago been finished.  I was ready for a nice glass of wine to compliment my now cooling appetizers.   The waitress did suggest and let me sample two nice red wines - I picked one and thought, OK now the great meal will finally get off the ground.\\n     Fighting waves of hunger (it was probably 10 pm by then) and trying to nibble the appetizers, I waited for the wine, and waited, and waited, and then it finally materialized - I was almost finished with my appetizers and I had only slowly picked at them! The wine, Crozes Hermitage, Esquisse, was divine, but not having it to enjoy with my appetizers just ruined the whole experience for me.\\n     The lamb belly appetizer was truly an amazing contrast of strong flavors and textures.  My other appetizer, the foie gras torchon, might have been wonderful if served on its own with time to savor  its delicate flavor and with the aforementioned wine to slowly sip between bites.  But thrown at me with the other robust flavored appetizer with no wine to nurture my palate converted it to a bland heap of something soft to spread on toast - neither memorable nor intriguing. \\n     Before I finished my two appetizers, my entree, the  duck confit,  showed up.  So now I have three plates in front of me. The duck confit - yes there was a crunchy skin and moist meat - but my serving also had pockets of salt, and more salt, and more salt.   It was like licking pure salt at times.   My dinner companions did not report the extreme saltiness that my plate had.  So  maybe someone just over salted mine.   I reported it to the manager and all that yielded was the comment \\"yes our version of duck confit is salty and some people complain but that is how we do it.\\"   I was flabbergasted. There was no effort to correct an obviously poorly prepared dish.\\n(Two people in our group had the gnocchi and neither liked it).\\n     Treat this place like a bar with food.   Stop in with maybe one friend and have a drink (the cocktails are really good) and maybe try one or two dishes, avoiding the ones that are poorly reviewed,  but a special dinner - forget it! (FYI tried burger on prior visit - good, very moist and cooked to order, definitely a gourmet version of a burger, but not worth a special trip just to try it.  It is still just a burger.)\\n     I am giving this place only one star because like I said in the beginning - a memorable dinner has to be well paced so that you actually enjoy the separate dishes and beverages in a well orchestrated progression like the separate movements of a concerto.  I can overlook one bad dish or some spotty service - but I can't excuse the combination of bad pacing,  some bad dishes, and a bad attitude towards the customers.

Basically, she did what Yelp exists to do: inform other would-be customers of customer experience, communicate those experiences to businesses so that they can be informed of customer input, make changes if they wish, ignore them if they want. Everyone is supposed to win. Yay, Internet! Informed consumer/conscious  business person relations are the best!\\n\\nThen came the response. Instead of the usual \\"thanks for your time in writing your thoughts, hope we can do better next time, here's a coupon for one lavender flower\\" or, I don't know, just ignoring it entirely, what happened was the most inappropriate response from a business owner I have ever had the sincere displeasure of reading, including everything from sarcastically insulting the wife's Yelp elite status to pretentiously listing satisfied customers in \\"California and Nee York\\" as a reason for not giving a sh** that you can't afford our furniture. Factual statements about an actual customer experience from a real life customer got a response from the owner which I can only describe as reminiscent of comment trolls on the Internet. It was a reaction both excessive and kinda crazy, which offended me far more than my own 3ish star experience of actually going to their store. (If there were categories, I'd give 5 stars to individual barista, 3 to the coffee, one to the 35-odd minutes of time I had to wait before I could leave, -20 for owner-customer service relations). \\n\\nAnyway, the owners' consistent, extremely aggressive, prickly, and mean-spirited tirades written in response to any criticism are so outlandish and inappropriate to the point of suggesting comedy, leaving me feeling like I'm at the receiving end of some sort of meta-comedy project, sort of like that time Joaquin Phoenix faked being crazy for a year or so just to make a movie with Casey Afleck. \\n\\nSadly, I think this is really who they are and what they are about. And either way it's customer-as-victim. At the end of the day, with Propagation, You either are with them fully, or you're an *expletive* who must be dealt with harshly, quickly, and publicly. There is no middle of the road, and apparently no room for an honest review without bitter, failed New Yorker writer level angst being directed your way. It's a zero-sum game. \\n\\nLook, I respect a business owner for trying to create something new in a sea of strip malls and hollowed out suburban shopping malls. Orlando could do with many (many many) more independent coffee roasters and shops, amongst other businesses. I've lived in cites half this size with three times the coffee options. My life gets better every time a new business that isn't Starbucks or Dunkin doughnuts opens up and sells black coffee I can actually drink without having to dose it with sugar or cream to make it palatable. Propagation is attempting to create a space for a product  (maybe products) they clearly believe in and with an aesthetic of which I believe they should be proud. Would that they could just focus on doing that instead of sarcastically lashing out at customers who have the temerity to weigh in with their experience honestly. \\n\\nReally, this place should be renamed \\"Polarization.\\" You're with them or against them. Cause with them, there is no middle ground. For me, after reading the most insulting and hateful response to a mild and genuine review, admittedly by someone I'm rather fond of, I've determined to be against them. \\n\\nDon't worry, as they'll happily point out, they're clearly satisfying customers in \\"California and New York\\" with their very expensive resale furniture business. So the 4$ cup of coffee I rate at 3 stars? They could care less. They don't need my business. And they're happy to say so."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The best thing to eat in Portland!

I've described this North Campus institution to friends as \\"Applebee's for hipsters\\", and after treating them to an ice cold PBR tallboy and one of their overstuffed breakfast burritos, they quickly joined me as being pro-Dube.\\n\\nI will concede that some of the items on the menu are pure, unadulterated crap. The club sandwich is bland and mushy, the scrambled eggs are soggy and rank smelling, and the cheeseburger has enough grease to keep the engine of a Mack truck lubricated for years. Ordering food here is a process of trial and error, and fortunately here I've done it enough times that you won't have to. The reuben dog, for example, is a rather curious item that turned out to be surprisingly delicious. I like hot dogs (and unless you're a bloody communist, you probably like them to); I also like reubens. The combination made no sense whatsoever, but it's proven to be my go-to meal whenever I find myself at the Dube in a drunken stupor. I also recommend the breakfast burrito- it's chocked full of flavor and is the size a new-born baby. Make you sure you get extra enchilada sauce to cover it in, though, as it can be a little bit dry at times.\\n\\nIf you're not in the mood for a cheap, gut-busting meal, the Blue Danube is also a more than decent place to meet friends for a drink or two.

Getting waited on when you're just in the mood for a few beers is a nice perk as well, regardless of the servers' frequently sassy attitudes. Like I said, people come to the Dube for it's offbeat charm.

Really, just try it. You won't be let down.\\n\\nAnyway, on to the biscuits and gravy - I prefer the mushroom gravy, now that I have tried it. REALLY FKN GOOD. The biscuits are decent but I think its the gravy that makes this place amazing. \\n\\nThe sad truth is, i've tried a lot here. The Reggie is always a hit, The Moneyball is good too, if you want the biscuits and gravy with a little extra somethin, somethin.  I have had The Club, not the biggest fan of that one but I love me some fried green tomaters. \\n\\nThe Stumptown coffee is delish, as usual. And it is \\"self service\\", not really an issue here, unless you're super lazy.
