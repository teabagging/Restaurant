Sadly, this place cannot come close to even the mid range restaurants in Peru like Panchita, Saqra etc.  For the price I paid here I would have rather dined in restaurants like Astrid, Maido etc in Peru or even Tanta in Chicago or Coya in Dubai.   With this price point and hype, I was really expecting to get the same gastronomy experience as those restaurants but sadly did not.   We ordered 3 small plates for starters and 2 main dishes.  All 3 small plates were mediocre at best.  The Ceviche that everyone is raving about is GOOD but not Amazing.  I have tried Ceviche in different parts of the world and this one does not rank up there plus I find it expensive for what you get.  The avocado with crab was a let down, it was subtle but the flavors were not complementing at all.  I love subtle dishes but it only works when you taste the flavors in layers and even if they come in subtle hints, they harmonize very well.  This did not do any of that.  I tasted the avocado and I really had to dig deep in my taste buds to find the crab and whatever flavors were supposed to be there.  I thought it was going to be a major waste of my time until they served the Paella.  I have to say that it is one of the best Paellas ive ever tried in North America.  Im a Paella lover and I really fell in love with Andina's version.  This is a good dish which is worth the price point.  I would go back here, order this dish and call it a night next time.  \\n\\nDont get me wrong this place is not bad in fact im giving it 3 stars but I find it overpriced, over-hyped and just not at par with celebrated Peruvian restaurants that I truly enjoyed.  Taste is subjective, if you have been to Peru and been to the restaurants there and paid half the price for more delicious meals, you might be disappointed with this place.  However, if you just want to try something different and value is not a big deal for you then this is not a bad choice.   It doesn't help that this place is way too loud that you have to scream at each other to have a conversation.  Our space is a bit cramped and the service was OK.  Will I be back?  Are you paying?  If you are then sure otherwise, ill have to look somewhere else.  I have no problems paying big bucks for a meal but they have to be worth my hard earned money."},{"name":"Mecatos Bakery & Cafe","address":"857 Woodbury Rd, Unit 105","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This hidden little place is great!

And by \\"interesting\\", I'm not talking in a positive way.\\n\\nWe ate at Not Your Average Joe's in late June, 2018.  We walked in about 9:30pm and were seated immediately, the restaurant was not very busy by that time.\\n\\nWe got seated and our waitress Claudine brought us both a glass of water (we weren't sure what we wanted to drink yet) and a basket of bread with seasoned oil to dip it in, which was absolutely delicious.  So far so good.  Once we were ready to order drinks and an appetizer, Claudine came over and took those orders.  The drinks arrived very timely, though somehow, perhaps by witchcraft or something, my raspberry lemonade, despite being full of ice, was lukewarm.  I don't know how they did this, but that temperature sensation made it much less enjoyable to drink after a very hot day.  Worse still is that once I was finished with both the lemonade and the water given previously, Claudine didn't offer to refill either one for the rest of the night.\\n\\nAfter we finished eating the bread and oil that was provided, our meals, a burger and a wedge salad with steak, came and both of those were absolutely astounding, both cooked exactly the way we asked for and flavorful.  But we never, ever received the appetizer we ordered!  Claudine asked when we were about mid-meal if we ever received the appetizer, and we said \\"no, we didn't\\" and she explained that somehow someone forgot to bring it out of the kitchen.  I've worked in the restaurant business, how exactly does a plate sit there in the warming area unclaimed for, what, about 20 minutes?  As a chef, if something's sitting there longer than about 5 minutes, I start asking questions.  That seems very odd to me.  Anyway, luckily we didn't get charged for the appetizer and Claudine did ask if we wanted to take it home anyway for our trouble, but since we were staying at a nearby hotel, we really didn't have the ability to take it with us.\\n\\nI'm hoping this was just a sub-par night, perhaps it was a long, hot, busy shift and the crew was tired.

He had never been in a skyscraper before, and was so excited he didn't even want to see the view on the website because he wanted to be surprised. He had a burger, I had a turkey sandwich.  We ordered the cookie plate which I remember from years ago as being delicious. It took 25 minutes for the cookie plate to arrive after we were done eating, despite having ordered it at the beginning of the meal because it said \\"allow 10-15 minutes\\" for it.  The cookies were totally overcooked, nearly burned.  Total for 2 sandwiches, water and burned cookies: $70.  But this was nothing compared to what happened after the meal.  We politely asked to see the view from the other side because my son wanted to see our town or anything at all that he recognized as this was his first time in any tall building.  They said no.  I explained, he is (a polite, well-mannered) 10 years old, just a quick look, first time up to see the Boston skyline but no, they refused us completely, saying we might \\"disturb\\" the other diners.  They advised us to go to the observatory downstairs, for an additional $38, after already spending $70 on lunch.  So my kid left his birthday lunch in tears, turned away, as 3 nasty people at the hostess desk told him he couldn't go a few feet past the bar to look out the window. I was dumbfounded.

There weren't that many veggies either (a stray pea here, some carrots there).  It also tasted a bit bland or not that flavorful?  Maybe it needed more soy sauce or salt & pepper.\\n\\nGeneral Tso Chicken, which everyone expects to be a thinly breaded chicken deep fried with yummy spicy/sweet sauce came out more like sweet and sour chicken (i.e. lightly colored batter that is voluminous surrounding chicken).  The sauce also seemed a bit off... maybe the got the order mixed up?

She said they had had some sort of system issue the evening I had dined there and were not able to capture my credit card number. (Keep in mind the only way they were able to even contact me was because of my OpenTable reservation.) My husband checked his statement, and indeed did not have a charge from Lenoir. I called back to get more information, and the manager stated that while they took full responsibility for the system issue, they needed me to pay the balance. \\n\\nWanting to do the right thing, I offered to go in yesterday to the restaurant to pay.

I understand Lenoir's mistake of double-charging a card and realizing that mistake, but don't lie to me about it, blaming a system issue.

I'd been up to the skywalk observatory last month, so I was super excited to spend a few hours over dinner enjoying the nighttime scene.  Despite the fact that it'd been dreary all day, the view was amazing! It was fun looking out over Boston, trying to pick out landmarks in the dark. And the service was just lovely.  I've been to Gordon Ramsay at the London, and ToTH blew Ramsay's restaurant out of water as far as service goes despite the fact that food quality is comparable.  Actually, on second thought, ToTH is more generous with portion sizes.  Winning!\\n\\nSo on to the actual dining experience.  We made the reservation via Open Table and requested a window seat, and I was super psyched that they were able to honor our request. Our server was super nice and the epitome of attentiveness.  Our water glasses were never past half full (or empty depending on your perspective), and another server would occasionally walk by with yummy bread.  Rosemary focaccia was the bomb.  We each opted for the 3-course dinners. \\n \\nAppetizer: spicy lobster soup and braised short ribs.  Mmm... every bit of each of these was delicious.  I'm a huge fan of coconut milk-based soups, and there were biggish chunks of succulent lobster to boot! And to top it all off, the bowl of soup was quite large. I was semi-filled on just appetizers and bread.  This also happened to be the first time I've ever had gnocchi.  Not much flavor to them, is there?  The short ribs, however, were packed full of flavor.  \\n\\nMain: Braised lamb shank and veal (with bone!) sirloin.  When the lamb came, I was astounded by how big it was. I've had lamb at nice restaurants before...but they usually leave me wanting more.  At ToTH, this was not the case.  It was both delicious AND huge.  It may sound gross, but the little strips of fat on the lamb were the most heavenly things I've ever tasted. Drool. We asked for the veal to be medium-rare, but it came out more medium-well.  Normally, I'd send it back, but it still tasted so good, I didn't feel like I'd been cheated.  In retrospect, I think I should have sent it back. You never know. Maybe instead of being merely delicious, it could have been mind-blowingly orgasmic. \\n\\nDessert: Maple cr√®me brulee and apple cobbler. You can't go wrong with either normally, and this is especially true at ToTH.  We almost couldn't finish the cr√®me brulee... there was just so much food provided during this meal.  My only complaint about the apple cobbler was that it had raisins, but I'm sure many more people actually enjoy raisins...\\n\\nIn the end, we left super happy and content.

I read a magazine that rated this the number one up and coming restaurant in the city and was surprised we were able to get a reservation so easily.  \\n\\nThe staff was very friendly.  This is a foodie place.  We had yet to have a quintessential Atlanta or Southern food experience and hoped this place would provide it.  So we stuck to items on the menu that we thought would be most representative.\\n\\nWe started with a \\"shared\\" dish -- smoke box cornbread with country ham, bacon and jalapeno butter.  Awesome.  The corncake was moist and flavourful.  There was a paper thin slice of ham over the top of the cake and a dollop of jalapeno butter that melted into the dish.  Decadent.  More than ample for two.  We struggled to get through just half of it.\\n\\nWe moved on to the North Georgia brook trout.  It was delicious -- the meat was tender, moist, flaky and the skin crispy.  Just a tad greasy, like they used too much fat to achieve the crispness.  We split that as well.  It came unceremoniously hacked in half -- not a very pretty presentation.  \\n\\nThen we had the roast pork which had a promising description but was such a disappointment.  Dry and tough.  Even the cube of pork belly was not tender.  Normally you can cut pork belly with a fork or spoon.  We sawed away at it and chased it around the plate.  But the charred leaves of kale were a revelation.  A wonderful accompaniment.  There was a sprinkling of scuppernongs which really made the dish feel authentic.  Fruit is often paired with pork and this was a nice balance.\\n\\nWe finished up with an ambitious dessert of pumpkin spice cake, a maple like ganache (at least I think it was maple) with beads of white chocolate and ribbons of caramel.  It was a great combination.\\n\\nAll the dishes we were served were large portions.  We were amply satisfied with sharing.\\n\\nThe drinks list was extensive.  The wait staff was polite and attentive, although this is a casual place and the demeanour was ambient.\\n\\nValet parking is nice. Noise level is energetic.

I loved the feel of the place! Gold gilding everywhere, high ceilings, crescent booths, marble, glass; very 1950s Hollywood chic. We made a reservation a week prior and were told that there was only ONE 9pm reservation left for Valentine's Day. \\n\\nThe service was only alright for such atmosphere. The surroundings felt palacial but the service felt not like 50s glamour...more like 50s diner-ish.\\n\\nWhen it came to dinner, one of our Duck Two Ways was WAY overcooked and we sent it back. Our server comped our wine to make up for it, which was nice, but then the dessert came out (Red Velvet Valentine and Triple Chocolate Something) and was almost frozen solid. We asked for the manager. She came over and I explained to her that one of our entrees was subpar and the dessert was frozen. She argued a bit about the dessert until I told her she was welcome to give mine a squeeze to see if it budged (still frozen). She comped our whole meal and gave us a credit to come in for breakfast...nice of her, I suppose, but it kinda felt like she was getting us out of her hair. We still tipped our server (Kai) 20% on the total of what the meal would have been...not his fault the food was off.\\n\\nMuch more than debating the quality of the food with the manager and getting our meal comped, I would have loved to have a fabulous dinner experience.  We got dressed up to the nines for the occasion and were both dissapointed by the food and service at Gracie's. On top of this, we were informed that our reservation was the ONLY one open, at 9pm, for the whole place. When we arrived in the dining room, a good 75% of the tables were neatly set...but empty. We were excited at the prospect of a Valentine's Day dinner in a bustling, happening restaurant; instead we got service that ill-matched the atmosphere of the restaurant, food that a chef shouldn't let out of the kitchen, the place being closed up around us, and a credit to try it all again the next day. \\n\\nAll in all: Our hotel stay was SUPERB....our Gracie's experience....not so much."},{"name":"XLB","address":"4090 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay place,  but didn't make the greatest first impression.

Hmm, ok, well that was kind of abrupt. Then she returns with our check. We didn't ask for it. My friend was still on her first taco and had over half her beer left. The waitress then turns to the other table by us and offers dessert. We weren't offered dessert, or asked if we needed or wanted anything else. And the restuarant wasn't even busy.

Portion size, I would say is average.  We also shared a spring roll, which tasted nice and crispy, but was overly oily.  They were maybe in a rush and didn't let the oil drain enough after deep frying. \\n\\nThe ambiance was nice, although there were two big parties with a few noisy kids.. But that's not the restaurant's fault. \\n\\nUnfortunately, here are the bad parts.. \\n\\nAlthough they had 4 wait staff on duty in a smaller size restaurant, the service was very slow.  I was ignored 3 times as I was trying to flag the waiters down.  Our food took a long time to come out.  The teapot was tiny (just enough for three cups) which added to the frustration of getting someone to refill it all the time.  We were seated at a 4 person table, then asked to move to a 2 person table, which was only separated from the table next to us by literally only 4 inches. \\n\\nThe food was too pricy.  Although the food did taste good, it wasn't anything special that deserved to be twice the price of a regular Vietnamese restaurant.  My Beef Stew was just plated nicer than usual, but otherwise was the same Beef Stew I could get from a \\"lower end\\" Viet restaurant for almost half the price. \\n\\nThe stone pot was good too, but it wasn't cooked in the stone pot, so paying so much extra for this rice dish wasn't worth it. \\n\\nMy final opinion..  If they want to differentiate themselves from a run-of-the-mill Viet restaurant, then their service needs to be better than run-of-the-mill.

The only reason I gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because of the steak quality for the price. It is a bit pricey but I still think it's worth it. The buffet had all the classic Brazilian foods and salad: rice and beans, farofa, veggies, fish, and etc. The rotation of meats also gave a lot of variety and were cooked to different stages meaning you could have anything from well done to medium rare. The rotation also happened very quickly so our plates were never without some kind of meat. There is also a great dessert menu that offers a few authentic options.

I kept it a little known secret (when I still had FB, I removed my birthday date and I demanded my family not wish me a happy birthday to start a chain reaction of a depressing reminder that I am creeping up in age).  My birthday was on a Saturday, and I spent that particular weekend in Atlanta, to catch up with some dear friends.\\n\\nDaniel B, Vyvy T, Annie C, and Carlos H had reservations that night to go to Poor Calvin's  They were kind enough to let me tag along.  Again though, the burning question, where in the hell is this place?\\n\\nWhen my brain finally put 2 and 2 together, I realized it was the old Irish Bar!  I was amazed, because I kept thinking to myself how a dive bar could have turned into one of the most popular restaurants in the city.  Aside from the small parking lot, when I entered, I immediately understood why.\\n\\nLike Jang C said in his review, this place will surprise you for its size.  There are a bunch of rooms, lots of bar seating, and the enclosed patio on the back side, each room seemed to have been themed just a little differently.  We had a table on the patio.  It was nice, as it wasn't overly crowded- a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nIt was definitely intimate- a great place for a date.  I came in a little late (had to find the place!)- but only by a few minutes.  I was seated, and immediately was looking at the drink menu.  I remember getting a drink with bourbon in it (I know Vyvy had one- she had recommended it- good call!)- it had a single ice cube, and was presented in an angled glass.  It was tasty!  I know I definitely had more than one drink.\\n\\nThe menu was vast as well, with a ton of options.  I remember we got something different so we could share and taste a variety. I do know we did get 2 orders of that special mac n cheese (correct me if I am wrong, but I think there was lobster in it!)\\n\\nThe food came out fairly quickly, and I remember everything tasting wonderful.  With the present company included, it only made it better.  I was thoroughly impressed with the place.  The chef came by the table and we expressed his gratitude for us visiting.\\n\\nI did have to go to the restroom, and for a place that used to be a house, I wasn't that surprised that they had 2 single restrooms.  Thankfully, I was finally able to go (I almost thought about taking the damn hinges off the door to see if someone fell asleep in there!).  Bathroom was interesting as well!\\n\\nIt was a special night, with special people, getting to enjoying some unique and tasty food.  Of course that would be a recipe for a 5 star review!  I would love to go back and try some more items- definitely worth it!  I also like the fact that since it is fusion and if one is not fully cultured in certain Asian cuisine, this place could definitely help bridge that gap."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Totally love this place.

We also dislike driving (enough of that to work) so we picked this place close the to the PGE Max Station just walk down the street. \\n\\nAt first I was little nervious if the customers would be rowdy and noise of sports TV would overwhelm us as some review has complained, but when we visited around 6pm on Wednesday evening it was relatively laid back and the girl who greeted us was very friendly and helpful, so she eased my fears. We already make sure to eat and drink water before we consume any alcoholic beaverage, so I ordered steak (killer deal for $11) and he ordered a 1/3 pound burger. Food arrived in no time, and we were so full I was not sure we could even drink afterward! I even called my friend over and he had no trouble finding the place, and my BF even met his co-worker, who states he is a regular. We played pool and enjoyed the ambient music without having to raise our voices to speak. \\n\\nThis was also my first time using the coupon from restaurant.com, and I was afraid of being discriminated (even with automated 18% gratuity fee and $35 min. purchase). But the server just smiled and said it was her first time processing the coupon, and she did just fine! We gave her extra tip and left very happy.

The creme brulee hadn't had enough time to set, so it was more like a custard than creamy and thick. The chef also put too much sugar on top, so instead of a light crunch, it was thick and burnt, getting stuck in your teeth. The ginger cheesecake was thick and gritty, not creamy. It crumbled when you put your fork through it, and the \\"ginger\\" part of it was barely noticeable.\\n\\nGood chef.

I arrived there around 8:45 p.m. (I felt kind of bad because they were closing in about 30 mins), sat down and took a menu off of the front desk. It's definitely more of a classy cafe style joint. There were candles on the tables, napkins wrapped around silverware.. you get the jest. \\n\\nOrdered: Greek Salad, Veggie grape leaves platter (Comes with grape leaves, hummus + pita bread (although the description labeled it as Lenabloush bread..?) All of the dinner platters come with a choice of soup of house salad. \\n\\nGreek Salad: Crispy and sweet romaine lettuce (YAY!), feta cheese, black olives, tomatoes with a balsamic vinaigrette it seems. It was light and refreshing, the feta cheese complimented the dressing nicely. My only compliant would be the black olives, the salad was loaded with so many! It's a nice addition to the salad, but it can get pretty salty if you eat it continuously.. The dressing was tangy and refreshing. You should ask for the dressing on the side, as the olives add a salty note already. \\n\\nGrape Leaves platter: I LOVE grape leaves. I must admit, I was first introduced to them by my local Winne Dixie, but gradually discovered the wonderful entertainment these leaves have to offer from trying them out from various places. Hummus is another love of my own. The portions of grape leaves they give you is very generous. Many other places serve about 5 small (2 inches)grape leaves for 4.99, but here, they give you about 10 (4.5 inches) grape leaves with about 1/4 cup of Hummus for 11.99. The rice inside the leaves weren't soft, but more on the ''well cooked'' side. The flavor had a somewhat acidity aftertaste on the leaves. It was rolled neatly, but the flavor wasn't my cup of tea. It was very mono-toned and lacked a little something something. The hummus was the same, it was too nutty in my opinion, and the texture was that of yogurt. Very liquidity and I didn't see much traditional seasonings dolloped on top..it has parsley on top I believe.  The bread came out warmed, but got hard and cold in about 2 minutes.. I've had this experience at home if I microwaved the pita bread, however warming it through my a pan/oven and wrapping it with a towel always solved this problem. The platter was served with three pickled beets which weren't very pickled.  \\n\\nPerhaps I'm being a little too critical, I mean, I'm nowhere near the field of being a well-informed advocate of this type of cuisine... This might be a good place for lunch or dinner for some, but I will always stick with my favorite joint. The service was AWESOME, but the food was kind of lacking an authentic touch to it.

We tried the Omnivore and the Cadillac and we were blown away by the intense flavors that hit our palate.  The Cadillac is a unique mix of gorgonzola, fig preserves, prosciutto, and balsamic drizzled on top.  It is not the toppings you expect but you will want more than one piece after your first!  The Omnivore was more traditional but with the best pepperoni I have ever tasted and a hefty serving of marinara on top to add a fresh taste of tomato.  I will be back to this place every time I go to Austin.  I recommend looking at their hours because they are only open during the evening when East 6th lights up! Also, we were fortunate enough to speak with one of the owners and he was very helpful in our selection.

They sell by the glass, or in different caraf sizes or by the bottle. I tried two different reds in the $12/glass price range and was happily pleased with each one. The waitress was very helpful in choosing both and I had absolutely no complaints with either. \\n\\nFor an appetizer we had the calamari with a wasabi cream sauce. WOW! Let me say this is the BEST calamari I have ever eaten in my entire life. It was perfectly cooked (not chewy at all) and paired with the wasabi cream, it was absolutely amazing. I could have eaten a whole other order of it by myself it was so tasty and delicious. \\n\\nFor dinner I got the lamb. The meat itself was very tender, practically falling off the bone. It was served with white beans and winter vegetables in a apple gravy of sorts. While the meat was excellently cooked, it definitely lacked some salt. We joked that if we were on Top Chef Tom Coliccho would have sent it back because of the lack of salt.  Jeremy tried the mahi mahi - it was very very good. I wished that I had gotten it for my meal after I tried it. It was served with a spicy/cajun style rice in a lobster broth.

It was hot and paired with the cold ice cream it was rich and delicious. I don't even like Nutella that much, but I loved this bread pudding.   \\n\\nOverall it was a great time. It always is when we go. Two has a great atmosphere (did I mention that they also have live music on the weekends), it is decorated very cooly, and the food is really great.

There are a good amount of toppings, the right amount of sauce (which tends to teeter on the too saucy side in most places but not here) with a slight sweetness and the cheese is proportionate to each slice.

(white pie with spinach) lastly, amp up the garlic in those garlic knots! \\nMy husband got the sausage, ricotta, and red pepper (Tried and True) of which I had 1 bite, sausage was not for me. \\nThese pizzas are huge FYI, 16\\" for a medium and 18\\" for a large. You cannot down this thing alone.. and if you can, you're a boss! As per the usual of pizzas, they are pretty hardy and will leave you feeling full but not quite like the greasy heaviness of dominos/pizza hut/papa johns. This is a more natural full since the ingredients are more fresh. If you get there early enough you can enjoy a slice. I should have opted for that since i was early enough to.. oops!\\n\\nWait to be seated joint, with waiters, also outside/patio seating available in the back of house! If you don't want to dine in, stop by \\"More\\" right next door and take it to go!

My wife and I are vegetarian and vegan, so when I heard that this placed catered to vegan and non-vegans alike, I decided I had to go.  \\n\\nFor me, I was completely blown away by the lady behind the counter.   I assume she's the owner.  She was extraordinarily nice and really interacted with us.  Most restaurant employees I run into are usually kind of in robot-mode and go about doing their job with little interest and with even less personality.  The lady had plenty of suggestions for us, was extremely articulate, and had just a wonderful demeanor.  Personally, I've never run into an owner who had such a wonderful personality.  \\n\\nAnyways, you're probably thinking, \\"That's great and all, but what about the food?\\"  The food was excellent!  Upon ordering, the owner said that all of their sauces are prepared vegan-style, that way, anything on the menu can be adapted to be vegan.  I never really thought about it, but she said that  many restaurants may have sauces that have been prepared with certain meat juices and then sold as vegan...because there is no meat, per-se, in the dish.  \\n\\nI also liked how we had the choice of steamed or fried tofu.  \\n\\nSo while I can't comment about the meats served with the dishes, I can say that the two dishes that we tried - General Tso's Tofu and Mapo Tofu - were excellent.  The General Tso's was sweet and spicy without being too spicy or sweet; it was just right.  The Mapo tofu was a steamed tofu (so it should be a bit healthier) and the sauce was mild and tasty.  We also ordered some extra veggies to go along with the dish.  \\n\\nI'm used to going to restaurants and having an extremely limited selection of foods to choose from.  It's very refreshing to know that Sun Tong Luck can prepare dozens of dishes without meat!  \\n\\nDownsides: parking is kind of weird in this strip mall.  I had to park quite a distance to get to the restaurant, but as I was leaving, I believe that there is customer-only parking that I overlooked.

I don't eat meat and like my food less firey, but I do enjoy a peppery bite and some real flavor, so I opted for medium. (I also enjoy a glass of wine, but that's not an option here is you don't BYOB.) Unfortunately, all three of us found the food extremely bland. Nothing was inedible, and we realized talking it over later that we were all pretending to enjoy our experience for the sake of the others, but our waitress acted bored and we almost felt intrusive having interrupted her peaceful evening."},{"name":"Red Pagoda","address":"1408 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"this is the best food on the drive! delicious peanut satay soup, fabulous green papaya salad, yummy cold rolls, and coconut slushy drinks to die for! the staff is always friendly, they are happy to accommodate vegetarians (which is so hard to find at most vietnamese places), it is a nice atmosphere, clean and relaxed. i can't say enough good things, my partner and i go almost every week, so now we get a treat for being regular customers! and the prices are ridiclous, we leave stuffed to the brim for cheap. if you haven't tried it yet, do so. it will become a favorite, i guarantee!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great food in a great, historic location.\\nI've been hearing about this place a lot lately and, being just down the street for me, I finally decided to give it a try. Good choice! First of all, they don't seat you until the whole party is present, which I think is a good idea. Then you get assigned to your table (every room has its own name and history, the Atlanta room being the older/original one) and you can start ordering. The fun of it is that you get your own menu and order slip to fill up, and the waitress just comes around to pick them up once everybody's done.\\nThe food itself is \\"southern style\\" as opposed to \\"soul food\\" (the waitress gave us a little education about the difference - \\"soul\\" food being generally spicier and more seasoned), portions are generous (VERY generous) and the whole experience is just a lot of fun. The place it's huge, way bigger than you'd think from the outside, so there's no need for booking - they only take reservations for parties of 8 or more - even on a Friday night. On top of that, as a further convenience, there is a large and complimentary parking lot right in the back of the building."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Didn't get to explore inside cuz we were actually on our way to Mother's Bistro & Bar (a wonderful place btw), so our group split up and I was part of the group that left to wait at Mother's.

Simple, but I digged it. We got a wiiide variety of donuts... here's what sticks out in my memory:\\n- main Voodoo donut (jelly-filled-- my fav actually)\\n- Blueberry (hybrid of a bagel and donut)\\n- Cotton candy (awesome but too sweet. shrug, what did i expect)\\n- Oreo (self explanatory)\\n- and finally, Bacon-topped donuts.\\n\\nThe bacon-topped donuts remind me of a personal favorite of mine. Has anyone tried the Krispy Kreme donut sandwich w/fried chicken in between, typically sold at local county fairs?? Anyways, i LOVE those, and these bacon topped donuts remind me of them. It leaves this sweet and salty mixture of goodness to your tastebuds, while of course clogging your arteries.\\n\\nAfter Mother's Bistro & Bar and exploring some more, we went back to the hotel and gorged on our Voodoo donuts.

Our waiter (Lucas) was in a hurry the entire evening. There was very little introduction, simply rushing to our drink and food orders. My beer took about 15 minutes to arrive after I had ordered it, Lucas had not come back once in that time period. Both our appetizer and main course were delivered to the wrong table when they came out. It was obvious that the outdoor seating area was being mismanaged as many tables were receiving wrong orders. Following our meal we were handed the bill by Lucas. As he seemed he was in a rush I figured I would not look at the bill before giving him my card, I would simply verify it was the correct amount once I was ready to sign. I've never had an issue with this method before, I tend to trust in people until they prove otherwise (especially at a reputable establishment). As I was about to sign I noticed that he added 20% gratuity to the total amount purposely and swiped the card for that amount. He circled the 20% gratuity amount he added and drew an arrow to the new total that he swiped. I understand when the party is six or more that an 18% gratuity is typically added. However we were a party of two and 20% was added. I then noticed on the merchant copy that he added an additional $1.50 on top of the incorrect amount. Yes, the merchant copy was different than the customer take-home copy. As I was reviewing he clearly noticed from inside that I was investigating the error, when all of a sudden he decided to come out to our table and explain...which is interesting since that was probably the 4th time total he had seen us all night. The entire night he had not bothered to ask us how we were or how the food was. He went back in and corrected the total and attempted to sound sincere when apologizing.\\n\\nTypically I would be sympathetic and take it as a common/accidental mistake. However, this was not accidental. He clearly knew what he was doing when he swiped our amount, hand wrote and circled the amount he wanted to add (thinking he was making it \\"easy\\" for us), and acting as if he was in a big hurry so that we would not notice this mistake. Clearly this was not a mistake with how smooth and nonchalant his apology was...almost as if this were not a big deal and was very routine. There was no genuine tone or body language shown towards his apology at all.\\n\\nThis is simply asinine, pathetic and shameful. As a local here in Orlando knowing that this is a tourist location where many domestic and international travelers visit it's saddening to know that this waiter is attempting to steal money in a very deceiving fashion. I'm positive there are many visitors that simply sign away assuming the amount is what it is and not thinking anything of it. I was just lucky enough to catch it before signing. \\n\\nUnfortunately the response by the manager to our phone call the day after was no better...ignoring the fact that something very wrong occurred, not even taking the time to consider it. Once again, I live here in Orlando and I fully support our strong tourism and the businesses that service it. I'm not a believer in negativity towards a business unless it's absolutely deserved. However, this is undoubtedly deserved. I strongly caution you about going to this TGIF as there are unethical practices occurring.

Our party of 8 dined as a result of having our first   RSVP rescheduled, which is fine. We were seated at a table style to fit 6 ( two tables pushed together). Our plates didn't fit on the table; we had to dump our sides in our plates and give the server back the bowls to make room. Our food was very tasty but was cold. We waited over an hour for our food to arrive after we ordered.  We received half of our sides about 40 minutes after our food arrived so we didn't get to enjoy the full experience of having all meal items at the same time.We asked for the manager and the wait staff was confused on who that was initially. We were given free desert but nothing off our tab for the food that was not eaten/enjoyable due to being cold; the female who stated that she was the general manager told us that she had to \\"run a business and that she can't do that while giving discounts.\\" They then gave us out ticket with 8 people on one ticket and told us to sort it out because over a party of 6 they don't give separate tickets( would have been nice to know beforehand). I told the waitress to keep the Change from my bill and she said \\"oh you don't want it back?\\" When I replied no she shook her head with an attitude and put it in her pocket...no thank you or anything. One of my guest gave her exact change and she told my guest, \\"you can just keep your change.\\" At this point they just wanted us gone. I explained that we are 8 females that represent a group of about 400 ladies in the area that want to support and would really like if they could just do something to make this experience better... No chance. So here it goes. My party members are professional bloggers and very influential people of this city and their voices are being heard in regards to our experience.

I ordered a mushroom cheeseburger (it has a special name I just forgot it) and my husband had a calzone.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious!  My burger also came with fresh cut fries and that was delicious as well.  The burger not only had Oregon's famous Tillamook cheese and mushrooms, but it also had onions and green bell peppers.  It was a very hearty burger!  The calzone was just as delicious too.  It was crunch on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  I literally wolfed down my burger and fries and I wasn't even hungry when we got there!

Seriously, this tiny little restaurant in Brookline Village is off the charts amazing! \\n\\nWe went here for a rehearsal dinner for my best friend's wedding. His wife's family is Russian and they chose this place for our party. The group of about 18 of us had no idea what we were in for. I'm talking extra belt notch good food. \\n\\nA few quick notes about the place itself. We occupied more than half of the restaurant. There were two waitstaff serving our party. The flat screen TV is hung over the bar and does not have cable (we asked to watch the sox game). It looks like the bar is well stocked for such a small place. The rest room is a single serve and is past the bar on the way into the kitchen. There is a semi-circle padded booth at the head of the table, which our bride and groom occupied and seemed to be very comfortable.  \\n\\nNow to the food. They started us off with cranberry vodka, served in those old glass milk bottles. This was not your typical flavored vodka. It was just as potent as any straight up vodka, with just enough fruitiness to differentiate taking this shot from pregaming your freshman year in college. \\n\\nThen came the appetizers. I'm sure I will forget some, and don't know any of the names, but it really doesn't matter: everything was awesome. I will mark each dish with 1-3 \\"+\\" signs to rate their fantasticness.\\n\\nThere was a crepe with prosciutto served with caviar(++), pork slices with a great horseradish sauce (+++), some mushroom julienne thing topped with cheese that everyone else said was (+++) but I'm not huge on mushrooms so I gave it (+), seasoned potatoes with onions and mushrooms (++), a dumpling filled with meat (+),  beet soup which my friend hogged so I didn't get to try it. He said he doesn't eat beets but (obviously) loved it, so I'm going to go with (+++), salad - nothing extraordinary (+). \\n\\nAt this point, we were all already in love with this place. They just kept the plates coming for groups of 4 to share and pass. The food came before we even finished the last plate, so we had to pile it all on to make room on the table. Didn't bother me none.\\nThen came the main dishes. We didn't realize there was more, everyone was stuffed from the apps... but dear lord, it was glorious. So. Much. Meat. \\n\\nLamb shanks on the bone, so juicy and tender it felt wrong using a fork and knife (+++), Chicken legs which were absolutely my favorite - seasoned so perfectly and slow cooked so it was nice and juicy (+++), a duck dish with mashed potatoes which compared to the others wasn't as good, but still (+++) and sole - by far the ugly duckling of the main courses. I actually didn't eat any, so I won't rate it. \\nBy the time we polished off the last of the main dishes, we were all pleasantly drunk and jolly as we said \\"screw loosening the belt, it's staying unbuckled.\\" \\n\\n...And then came dessert. There's nothing like a perfect dessert to cap off a wonderful meal. The dessert menu consisted of ice cream, cake and blintzes, which are crepe-like and filled with either chocolate or fruit and served with ice cream. I was told it was awesome by those who ordered it. But I had my eye on the chocolate cake with ice cream. It was mousse cake, not Betty Crocker style. Served with just a drizzle of fruit syrup. Un-freaking-believable. I inhaled it. I was literally scraping my plate with my fork, trying to scoop the last bits of cake and ice cream into my mouth. I honestly didn't want to stop eating and I think I could have willed myself to keep going.

So we just hung out at the outside bar for a while. \\n\\nThe environment was nice, younger hip Atlantians, though we were in Buckhead so that's pretty common. Decor and setting was nice, although somehow me and my colleagues were seated right under an air vent and it was pretty cold. \\n\\nSo we order apps, and it comes right out with drinks in about 10min.

It tasted extremely bland, it was just about 6oz or so of a round slice of swordfish with some sauce on top of it, and some type of vegetables (cooked) on the side. All in all pretty disappointed. Also ordered a side of potato fingers which also had pretty much no flavor and were dry.\\n\\nAfter eating, one of my colleagues and I were still pretty hungry, so we ordered the \\"apple\\" cobbler with vanilla bean ice cream. How can you screw up a classic? Well, by making it some kind of pastry with 2 thin slices of apple on top, and the rest pretty thick bread with powdered sugar and cinnamon all over it. Oh, and the half-scoop of ice cream.

And once I got inside and tasted the food I saw why the wait was long, but for once well deserved.  I have traveled to Sweden and Denmark so I have a soft spot for all things Scandinavian.  That is not however a requirement for loving this restaurant.  The decor, the excellent service, & the amazing & thoughtful menu speak for themselves.  As does the food.  I had the apple fritters (after grappling with the decision to get the club sandwich) which came with eggs, creme fresh, syrup and a herb pork sausage.  I also got a baked grapefruit.  I normally hate grapefruit but I was intrigued and decided to trust the waiter.  It was divine - the cinammon, cardommon, sugar and other awesome things on top (nuts?) melded and \\"killed\\" whatever flavor I normally disliked in grapefruit.  The textures and the juice with the spices were unique & tasty.  The rest of my breakfast was also excellent.  Perfect really.  Both of my companions liked their breakfasts just as much too.

What's not to like? especially at a place like Franks. I tried the chili cheese dog on my inaugural visit. So choice. \\n\\nI also sampled a small order of their chili cheese waffle fries. Chili overload---and I'm not sorry. The fries held up rather well to the chili and retained a little crunch. Crucial for those chili fry officianados out there. The chili wasn't spicy at all, and had some sweetness. mmmmm.\\n\\nMy friend tried the jackalope with I'm told is a sweet and savory version of a haute dog. After tasting the dog, my pal thought it had 'a lot going on' and he ended up picking off the sweet relish, and remarked that he didn't like sweet relish so much. To each his own. However overall, the jackalope was a hit. The prices aren't too bad either, around 4-6$ for most of the items on the menu...\\n\\nI love the location and the design of the restaurant itself. The water glasses are mason jars which takes me back to childhood. There's an arcade for the kiddos and a stage for music, etc. The space is open, with high ceilings a smart and simple design throughout. It doesn't seem cheap or cluttered. Look at the ceiling fan too, I want one in my house. Rotating tiny fans on a larger ceiling fan....It was nice and cool on a hot day, despite the fact I was on chili overload. I felt comfortable enough to linger after I'd devoured my meal.\\n\\nThe service was great! The server was friendly, and really on top of his game. The friend I was with can be pretty difficult to wait on. But the server patiently listened to his list of extra items which was 5-6 items long and brought them out promptly.

However, I've ordered spicy tonokotsu in the past at other places and it is much richer and you can really taste the pork that has been cooking for hrs. I added the soft boiled egg which was waaaaay over priced (cold, slightly over cooked, and not even marinated in miso or soy, which most other ramen places I've had were AND the egg was included in the price.) I also added the corn and butter. However, what knocked 2 stars off were the Noodles! YUCK. They were like the 50 cent kind in the grocery store! Not chewy, definitely not homemade. They were super thin-which is fine with me-but so blah (hard and never softened to chewy) and unenjoyable. It's a RAMEN place, the noodles should be delectable...I left half of mine in the bowl and just enjoyed the broth and meat/veggies.

But be forewarned of the line. The Paramount works on a decades old system of lining up for your food, watching it being made in front of you, grabbing said food on tray, paying for food, and THEN sitting down to eat. Once you get through that process, though, there is always a magical table open and waiting. In the winter months this can be tedious, and any time of year standing around the grill area can get a bit toasty for anyone's own good, so be prepared! This is not the place for the elderly or the claustrophobic. \\n\\nI've only ever eaten here for breakfast/brunch/lunch, but they serve dinner as well. Breakfast can't be beat- if you like hearty, not too greasy, omelets, turkey sausage, whole grain french toast, hash browns, delicious bowls of fruit, and pancakes with strawberries, this is your place. The price points are pretty fair considering the Beacon Hill area and they accept credit cards. The real insider's tip? Avoid the line, look up their menu online, call in takeout, and rush in and pick up your delicious food to the envy of all those in line and enjoy it along the Charles or on the Common which are both just steps away! Breakfast shouldn't be hard to mess up, but somehow similar establishments nearby manage to do it at a much higher expense.\\n\\nI've recently tried the turkey burger and the black bean burger- amazeballs.

First off, the small is a fairly big portion! It's comparable to most other Taiwanese noodle places that serve one size (which is normally big to my standards).\\n\\nThe only difference is taste. The broth actually has taste here - many places seem to be so bland that it's easy to neglect the soup - which is not the point of having a bowl of soup!! Although I'm praising the fact that the broth here is heavier and beefier tasting, I have a gripe. I ordered the spicy (as opposed to mild/regular) and it was nowhere near spicy at all. In fact, maybe she gave me a mild - who knows, but it definitely isn't spicy. Jen was saying that with the old chef, a spicy bowl was really spicy. Weird.\\n\\nThe pickled radish on top complimented the otherwise mediocre taste of the beef flank. I do have to say that this was the meatiest and interesting beef soup I've ever tried - with barely any fat and the meat being more dense than soft. I think because it was more dense, it didn't pick up any of the flavour from the soup or marination.\\n\\nThe noodles were perfect, no complaints there.

The bar area is pretty large, with a long horseshoe shaped bar that accommodates about 20, along with a lot of table seating, and more bar type seating along the west wall. The place is an old converted industrial/warehouse type building about as close to the river as you can get on the east side. Located conveniently across from a bridge off-ramp, it has the advantage of no tall buildings across the street to block the view of the downtown skyline, which is a big plus; especially at night when you can see all the lights. While the bar is nicely done, and leaving a converted industrial place pretty intact often tends to work for some restaurants and bars, the rest of the interior seems a little unfinished. I hope that they'll spend a little time and money down the road to polish it up a bit. Still, it's a very comfortable place to hang out, and you're drinking HotD beers... what more do you need?\\n\\nThe quality is about as good as it gets. When you're in a bar where Adam and Fred on tap sound a little boring because of the other offerings, you know you're in a top notch place. The special stuff on tap I've tried since they've opened includes cherry adam, a few vintages of fred from the wood and doggie claws, 2009 jim, and little dog. Wow! The draft beers are definitely where the deals are. Even the best and rarest stuff is only $6.50 for a 12 ounce pour - about half the cost of buying it fresh in the bottle at a dock sale after waiting in line since 5 am... On top of the draft selection though, is the AMAZING collection of vintage bottles to try. 5 year verticals of doggie claws? Matt? 2005 rose cassis? michael? etc... yep!\\n\\nThen there's the service. As far as I can tell, there only two employees working at Hair of the Dog besides Alan, and they're great. Wendy in particular is super friendly and helpful, and goes out of her way to make sure you're enjoying your visit. I'd give the place a 5+ on service if I was just rating their individual performance, but the truth is, when the place is full, two just isn't enough. I have to dock a point for not having enough staff for busy times. Even so, I've never really had terrible wait times or anything, it's just nice getting a little more attentiveness, which is especially lacking sometimes if there wasn't room for you at the bar.\\n\\nThe selection is great. Like I mentioned when I was talking about quality, there is a wide range of beers (and vintages of those beers) to try that just aren't available anywhere else.\\n\\nThe menu is always changing, but I'm liking the direction that it's been moving since its debut. I've only ever tried the adam braised smoked brisket, and I thought it was a great snack to pair with the bold hair of the dog beers, and a good value too at $6. When they first began serving food, a lot of the menu items were priced a bit higher than I would have liked for the venue (although they may have still been a great value for what you got), and I'm glad to see most everything now priced at under $10; with a good variety to boot. Besides, it leaves more drinking money, and that's the point, isn't it?\\n\\nValue here is subjective. On tap, I feel like everything is a great deal, ESPECIALLY the rarer stuff. Like I said, I've waited in line for 5 hours to buy 12 oz bottles of some of this stuff at TWICE the price they're offering it on tap, and I guess that's the way it should be. The availability of some of the stuff they have only in bottles is fantastic, but here's where the value starts to seem questionable. On the same day, they let you choose between 12 ounces of cherry adam on tap for $6.50, or 12 ounces of the same vintage in a bottle for $12. Or how about $6.50 for 2007 doggie claws on tap, but $15 for a bottle? Then there's Matt, a FANTASTIC beer no doubt, but $25 for 12 ounces? There's how much you need to sell a beer for to make all the time and effort to make it worth while, and then there's how much you think you might be able to get someone to pay once in a while. I think a fair price is somewhere between the two, and some of these seem to be priced closer to the latter.\\n\\nAtmosphere and some of the bottle prices aside; this is a great place, and it would certainly be in my top 5 recommendations for anyone coming to Portland for beer. Visitors from other big cities might even find the prices really appealing. I've lived and traveled all over and know what things cost other places, and HotD isn't out of line when you take that into account. It's just a little high for Portland. Still, these aren't just any beers, this isn't some big corporation, and you don't get to really experience this kind of pride, hands-on attitude, and impeccable quality just anywhere, and that's worth a lot."},{"name":"The Federal","address":"204 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Ehh.... not the best I've ever had.

Boy, were were ever disappointed!  The house salad was inedible--had to send it back. It was soggy and wilted with rotten pieces of lettuce throughout. YUCK!  The free pot likker was okay, but, come on people, it's just hot water from cooking greens! The yeast rolls were good--soft and warm. Hubby's liver and onion entree with saut√©ed cabbage was okay but very skimpy portions. My Arnold Palmer drink tasted like sugar water--not much tea flavor and not much lemonade flavor either. My pork roast entree was terrible.  The sliced pork was lean and dry. The gravy was like wallpaper paste and tasteless. The cornbread dressing was tasteless mush. YUCK!.  The sweet potato souffl√© was way too sweet, with way too much nutmeg, and covered with sticky sweet marshmallow creme. Again, YUCK!  Hubby had to send back his dessert of bread pudding with WINE sauce--all you could taste or smell was WINE--I could have flambeed it---YUCK!  My strawberry shortcake had few strawberries and hard stale shortcake that could have been used as a hockey PUCK---YUCK!!  I felt so cheated.

The place didn't look like an Irish pub then, it was more like a gin mill for working-class locals. (It may not have even been called the Blackthorn in those days. If I noticed the name, I've since forgotten it.) The Boston guidebooks I'd read stated that some Southie bars weren't too welcoming to outsiders, so I stopped just inside the door, to suss out the vibe. Near the entrance was a cluster of what I took to be locals. They made a rather sullen tableau-------each one sat slumped on a bar stool, silent, staring down at his drink or straight ahead. I took them for disgruntled types who'd never managed to make it out of the neighborhood. (Which might account for why they were in a bar at 11:30 AM.) Probably exactly the sort of clientele the guidebook writers had in mind when they wrote their warnings. At the opposite end of the bar, however, was a totally different group of topers. These guys were better dressed, they were all standing and they actually seemed to be enjoying themselves. Between the two cliques was a long empty stretch of bar. Spiritually I probably belonged with the mopes, however, the person tending the bar was down by the good-time group, so I eased my way down to that end. I couldn't quite bring myself to actually join them, however, so I took a seat in the no-man's land in between. When I first entered I thought the person behind the bar was a twelve year-old boy. When I sat down, however, I realized it was a young woman. She was short, flat-chested, dressed like a guy and had very short hair, parted on the side. She also spoke with a brogue. As did all of the guys down at this end. Usually, I'm mainly interested in a bar's decor. This place had no decor, yet I found it fascinating, because of the schizophrenic division in the clientele. Stand or sit at the back of the bar and it was as if you were in a public house in good old Eire. Move a few feet and the ambience transmogrified into American bus station. A truly unique barroom experience for me. (But then, come to think of it, Boston provided several interesting travel experiences that I've never had anywhere else.)"},{"name":"Tatsu Japanese Bistro","address":"1441 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Best sushi on the Drive, hands down.

Wu Er's menu was everything I could dream of with its assortment of tapas, skewers, traditional entrees, and tremendous platters. The negative reviews about service though got me worried so I made a reservation for Friday night through OpenTable to avoid any possible waits and braced myself for the worst.\\n\\nI was trepidatious at first because when we walked in no one was manning the front counter. My friend impatient (& starving - we looked forward to this all day) walked straight to the back to a group of servers asking to be seated and mentioning our reservation and we were seated right. Besides this initial hiccup, everything else about the night was great.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 skewers of pork belly and lamb. They were heavy on seasoning - just the way I like it - and moist. The only other skewer experience I've had in Boston was at Mala and their skewers were comparatively super dry. The lamb actually reminded me of the skewers apps they serve at Penang - so a little more Malaysian style.\\n\\nWe got the Lobster Platter in the Ginger & Garlic Cream Sauce. This was amazing and as true to all the pictures you see on Yelp. Huge portion of udon in delicious cream sauce topped with lobsters, mussels, clams and shrimp. The flame on the bottom keeps the platter warm throughout the meal as you eat but also goes out at the right time so everything doesn't get overcooked.\\n\\nWu Er gladly accepted my friend's coupon and split the check for us. Definitely a bang for your buck as we even still had leftovers to take home. My friend has 2 more coupons from her office so we definitely want to go back and try a 'tapas' style meal (I seriously need dat Liang Pi doe) and test some of the entrees (Looking at you Beef Noodle Soup).

Was there last night with a party of four service was slow, ambience dark and uninviting for conversation, and the overall attitude of the management was take it or leave it when concerns were raised.  I know they have tried to increased business over the past year with Groupon specials but that does not work in building regular customers if the management has an attitude. That's why it continues to repost on Groupon because it can't keep a regular clientele base especially because of the competition in the area that offers a much better atmosphere and works hard at customer service.

I've heard so much about about the bacon infused bloody mary that I couldn't resist. We went on in and it was packed. Luckily though, a table at the bar opened up as soon as we got there, so I can't complain. We settled onto our high table and chairs and immediately ordered 2 bloody marys. What could be better than a bloody mary with bacon? Well, a bloody mary without bacon is better than a bloody mary with bacon. \\n\\nThe bloody mary mix is infused with bacon, the vodka is infused with bacon, and a thick slice of bacon is delivered inside your bloody mary. I understand it's a matter of preference, but the bacon flavor is just a bit too strong. Maybe if they ease up on the bacon infusing I'll like it, but I don't really think so. That's a lot of bacon flavoring. I am also not keen on paying $8.00 for a bloody mary. Some might not mind. Once was enough for me.\\n\\nAs far as food, I just don't get it. I tried some hawaiin hot dog and it was okay. Nothing I'll order again. I tried a regular hot dog. It was also okay, but again, nothing I'll really want again. I tried the hummus. It's better than the hot dogs IMHO. Not a fan of the pita bread either. I tried the corn. It's mediocre at best.

A good selection for slices. I skipped the spinach and ordered the others.\\n\\nAll were tasty, with my favorite being the margherita. The sausage was little round sausage slices, like pepperoni, not crumbled sausage chunks like I was expecting. The crusts were the best part - light, slightly crispy.\\n\\nBoth the plain and sausage looked like mall pizza slices though, the kind that had been left out too long under a heat lamp. And the cheese was wrong - this was most noticeable on the plain. NY style pizza (according to me at least, a NYer in my childhood) should have stringy cheese, so when you take a bite you have to munch down really hard so that the cheese connection between your bite and the rest of the slice gets broken, otherwise you get cheese and tomato bridges between your mouth and the remaining slice. The cheese on these slices was lacking that quality.\\n\\nOn the bright side, it was a cute neighborhoody kind of place, with babies, students, typical Austin customers. Their tables were properly equipped with grated cheese, oregano, and red peppers. And the service was good, it's always nice to be served by a cute perky server who's also competent.\\n\\nAll in all, good, but in my opinion doesn't live up to its current 4+ star rating (for the slices at least, fresh whole pies may be much better)."},{"name":"Juliano's Pizzeria","address":"15606 SE Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I had to think long and hard to give this pizzeria 1 star.  First,  a little bit about my background.  I have been making pizza for 40 years, which I learn from my dad, and passed to my kids.   \\n\\nThe goal every \\"pizza man\\"  has is to bake the best pizza in the world, or at least to be know for having the best crust, the best sauce or the best combination of toppings.  NONE of these elements were present in Juliano's.\\n\\nFirst about the pie itself:  You cannot equate the amount of toppings they put on their pie with quality.  True, they \\"pile it high.\\"  Unfortunately, if you put too much toppings the crust or the toppings cook well.  You end up with overcooked toppings on top and raw toppings on the bottom.  This was the case in Juliano's.  \\n\\nIn addition, the vegetables used in the pie had NO flavor.  The sausage was overcooked, was extremely spice, yet had no flavor.  The only toping I could actually taste in the pizza was the Salami.\\n\\nBecause there was so much piled on top you could not taste the sauce, and you had to make a conscious effort to find the cheese.  \\n\\nNow lets talk about the service.  The waitresses are very friendly and courteous.  However, bring a good book because the service is slow and they tend to disappear on  you.\\n\\nOverall, if you equate quality to quantity of toppings and you don't care about taste (maybe you are too drunk to taste anything) then Juliano's is your place.  If you care about the quality of the product, then avoid Juliano's like the plague."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ive come to 2UL so many times and they never disappoint!!

Naturally, paying the UOH was high on my \\"to-do\\" list given its historical significance and being touted as the \\"oldest restaurant in America\\". I sat in front of the raw bar with the fishy, oystery smells wafting into my nostrils from time to time. I can't say I enjoyed this and I must admit that the ambiance upstairs in terms of lighting and privacy were much better. I had the Seafood Newburg since its description sounded incredible, however, to be honest I was seriously underwhelmed. The thick glue of a sauce in which the scallops and prawns were drenched in was bland, appallingly orangey in colour, and tasted heavily of thick cream and only thick cream with no other discernable seasoning detected. The puff pastry was chewy, not fluffy and I had quite a struggle with my fork to tear it apart. The rice pilaf, being the standard side item was disappointing with the grains of rice heavily bloated and much too soft to the bite.

Upon this most recent visit, I find myself somewhat perplexed as to how to rate this brisket.  The flavor has definitely been improved, as there is a very tasty and pepper-y (my favorite) bark on the outside of the brisket.  After eating my first slice of (moist) brisket, I was ready to declare this as the 2nd best brisket in Austin, even coming close to Franklin's.  It had everything that I want out of a piece of BBQ brisket: perfect, charred crust full of pepper, really nice smoke ring and flavor, and the right amount of fat.\\n\\nHowever, the second slice (in my photos, this piece is in the front) contained absolutely too much fat.  Yes, I asked for the fatty cut of brisket, but this was out of hand and certainly the fattiest piece of brisket that I have ever had.  While I almost always opt for the moist brisket whenever I eat BBQ, I found myself not enjoying a piece as fatty as this one was.  I was tearing apart the brisket slice, so as to do my own fat trimming.  The flavor of the meat was still pretty fantastic, but I could not believe the difference between my first and second slices of meat.  I may need to try a lean cut next time for comparison's sake.  I think consistency in their meat (and fat trimming, pre-smoking) could really take JMueller BBQ up to the next level.

There are two oyster bars in the restaurant.  They are both long bars made of painted concrete slabs with peeled off paint, so it looks pretty worn down.  When eating at the bar, oysters are shucked in front of you and just put on the bar (Yes, no plates or tray or ice -  just the oysters on its shell) right in front of you.\\n\\nFor wine, they only sell them by the glass (and the glass is like a small plastic cup), but the price is quite cheap.\\n\\nOther items they serve are steamed crabs, steamed and fried clams, and crab cakes.\\n\\nAll in all, this will be an o.k. to somewhat good place to eat at if you don't care too much about the eating environment or atmosphere."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I moved to a new office located within five minutes of Home Slice.

First off, my feeling is that the dog had been made much earlier in the night -- possible sitting around already cooked and then they just reheated it after I ordered it.  Then, they put on a couple of tablespoons of chili and sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top of that.  The dog was completely dried out on the inside and had no moistness to it at all.  The ends of he hot dog had a dried-out/brownish tint.  The bun was crunchy from being over cooked/heated, so that when you bit into it, it actually started to fall apart.

Lenoir ended up being a phenomenal choice.  This adorable restaurant highlights French cuisine with influences from around the world including SE Asia in the Crawfish Curry, India in the Rabbit Terrine and the Southwest in the Pork, for example.  A very reasonably priced chefs menu for the technique and complexity the chef is creating here.  Drop this restaurant in any other city and it would easily be twice as expensive.  \\n\\nWe requested to try most the menu a plate at a time, which I recognize meant they wouldn't be able to turn the table.

I did not find anything on the menu remotely disappointing rather wondering how the next course could top what I had just eaten.  I confidently would order anything off the menu.  My favorites though:\\n\\nThe Texan bean salad with romanesco was my favorite of the salads.  An elegant dish that started the meal off well with a little spice that wakes your culinary senses while not blowing your palate out of the gate.\\n\\nThe Crawfish Curry was my favorite of the seafoods.  A well designed course with potatoes that were expertly prepared complimenting the texture of the Crawfish and curry sauce,  which has hints of SE Asian flavors.  This dish ate beautifully.\\n\\nThe Antelope Heart was my favorite of the land courses.  The charred sunflower was viscerally satisfying contrasted to the roasted parsnips, which were like candy, and highlighted by the seared heart.  \\n\\nLastly, the wine pairings.  I appreciate good wine pairings that elevate each course.  The Somm at Lenoir accomplished just that.  My favorite pairing was with the antelope heart.  A Pinot Gris that was crisp, refreshing and a great counterbalance to the char of the dish.

I tried to be open to the place itself; pulling in to the lot, I felt like we'd arrived at Disneyland. They've really gone all-out to give this place all the trappings of Ye Olde German Manor. And I appreciate some kitsch, so that worked for me. \\nI tried to be receptive to the menu; I was excited about the chicken-potato pie I ordered, and Mr. T ordered a sampler plate that promised a taste of Gustav's finest. My entr√©e, when it came, was...disappointing. It should have been called Potato-potato-pie...with chicken. There was mashed potato on the top that had been piped in patterns, like icing. That weirded me out. The chicken stuff underneath was pretty good, but there wasn't a lot of it. Mr. T's sampler plate was decent. He let me try his sausage--I figured that if there's anything to eat at a German restaurant it's a sausage, but it wasn't nearly so nice as a well-spiced Italian sausage. There was some chicken on his plate also and it was fine, had some nice gravy. Generally I think I will stick with cuisine that has less cheese and more spice."},{"name":"Stoli Bar & Restaurant","address":"213 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here for dinner the other night and sadly left a little bit disappointed.  Having Russian relatives means I grew up eating traditional, homemade Russian dishes regularly, so I guess my dissatisfaction is to be expected.  But I was still hoping!\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small and cozy, and the live accordion music and decor definitely gives the place a genuine Russian feel.  My friend and I were offered a choice between sitting at a small table by the window right next to the accordion player, or one that was a little further in.  Good thing we chose the latter, because I don't think I would have been able to hear myself talk if we sat right next to the music. \\n\\nThe waitress brought out bread as we were seated, but it was literally just a loaf of rye from the grocery store.  I only nibbled on one piece - better to save the stomach space for the real food!  For an appetizer, I ordered the Taste of Russia sampler, which consisted of three small bowls of food.  One was of some sort of cabbage salad that was literally nothing more than coleslaw.  The second was a shredded carrot salad - the dressing was very good.  The beet salad was the best part of the entire appetizer though, despite the fact that it was different from anything I've had before.  I'm used to the beets being in larger pieces, and this salad had them entirely diced up.  My friend got the mushroom soup, which was just alright.\\n\\nFor my entree, I had the manti, which are dumplings with lamb.  They were good, especially since I could drown them in sour cream (which, in my opinion, makes almost anything taste better), but I didn't particularly like the spice they put on them.  My friend got the beef stroganoff, and while he did let me try some, it clearly did not leave an impression on me because I don't remember it well enough to comment on it.\\n\\nI wanted to make one more mention of the music before I move on to dessert.  The accordion music was nice, I suppose, but it was a little loud.  And about halfway through the meal, it stopped completely, only to be replaced by dead silence.  I have never realized it before, probably because it has never happened before, but silence in a restaurant is just plain awkward!  Shortly thereafter, music by Sting filled the gap, which was just random.\\n\\nOn to dessert then.  If you're in a chocolate mood, definitely get the blintzes with warm chocolate mousse. I say that not just because they're delicious, but also they're swimming in a pool of chocolate syrup.  My friend got the apple strudel, which I thought was going to be the better dessert of the two, but I think my blintzes take the cake.\\n\\nSo overall, my experience at Stoli was a solid 3 stars.  I don't really have anything to complain about per se (except for maybe the fact that our waitress continuously kept asking if I was finished with my plate when I definitely was not), but there wasn't anything to write home about either."},{"name":"The Story of Texas Cafe","address":"1800 N Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Considering this cafe is part of the museum the food quality was actually decent.

I was expecting a table with a view or a separate booth. We were given a cramped little table in a shared space where the couple next to us was less than a foot away! That threw us off a little. I was expecting for them to make an effort to celebrate/acknowledge a birthday.

Line was to the door, but only took about 10 minutes to get through. Ordered the ODB, the Portland Creme and a couple others. I have to say: based on this experience, I would never go back. The donuts were very big, dry and tasteless... except for the frosting/toppings. They were cloyingly sweet, unsubtle, and probably more suited to the tastebuds of a 3-year-old than an adult. Imagine just pouring sugar on top of a donut and topping it with some sugary breakfast cereal... that's about the taste we got from most of these. \\n\\nThe Portland Creme was undercooked toward the center. I could literally taste raw dough. The other donuts were as noted... and the frosting was dry and crackly, as well. Just... unsatisfying. \\n\\nNow I would go back one more time. I generally don't write off places forever unless it's a service-based issue. So I may try again here. \\n\\nHowever, I made a special run out to Pip's Donuts, and discovered the single best donut (and chai) experience of my life.

Oh, it doesn't matter, does it? You will anyway. They are pretty delicious--make sure you ask for enough cheese because sometimes they skimp on it and only cover the tops of the fries. They're served with sour cream (the BEST idea ever) and are a must-get. \\n\\nDogs that I like include the Jackalope, the classic chili-cheese, the Currywurst, and the Lila Dog (their most recent promotional dog, which is like a chili-cheese but a tiny bit more fancy). They've also got a whole slew of beers, depending on how artsy you are or how much you want to impress people you're with. I'd recommend getting a dog with a good blast of flavor because some dogs with plainer or less ingredients can end up tasting quite bland or not worth your money. \\n\\nOne more thing: GET THE CORN CUP!!

We figured we'd be well enough South of the main festivities but we were very much mistaken. It was like someone lifted a very hip rock and Bohemian roaches scattered everywhere (but at an ironically casual pace, don't you know). So we couldn't be sat for the better part of an hour. Then, later, it rained. And we were there to visit family. Bottom line is, the conditions weren't ideal but I've tried to not let them affect my judgment.\\n\\nOnce we got seated, service was quick and almost comically friendly. It's like the server was on happy-acid.

They were terrific -- not over dressed (unlike so many of the folks roaming the streets outside).\\n\\nWe also ordered two pizzas -- their margharita which was only so-so and their sausage/ricotta/and red pepper. The latter selection was the clear table favorite, but I think that was only in contrast to the blah margharita. It was good, even somewhat healthy-tasting, but that's not really what I was looking for. I wanted a grimy, oil-laden, real New York style pizza -- one that I could waddle away from, pleased but ashamed. So on that front, I was less than completely pleased.\\n\\nStill, the service was quick and effective and the place was saturated with the sort of cool one comes to Austin and Congress Avenue for.

We ordered Chicken Poori as an appetizer, which is like a Bangladeshi burrito and delish. For our mains we split a Chicken Tee-ka Moshol-la and Lamb Shaag Paneer Maang-sho.  Both were awesome - the latter being a creamy spinach dish that we'd never had before.  We also had the mixed naan, which is naan stuffed with cheese, onions and garlic.  We ate every bite of the food and loved it.\\n\\nDespite some reviews complaining about service, our service was excellent. Keep in mind that the restaurant was packed with people and several large parties so I was prepared for the worst.  However, they kept our water glasses full, our food came out pretty quickly.  The only thing we had to wait for at all was our check - but even that wasn't very long.\\n\\nThe owner Mirza can either make you love the place or rub you the wrong way.  He definitely has his opinions about what you should order, especially if you're new - but he also gives the place personality, has great recommendations, and is very friendly.  He was very helpful in helping us order what we want, but also push us to try some things we might not have otherwise.\\n\\nThis is definitely one of our favorite Indian/Bangladeshi places in Atlanta and we'll be back soon!"},{"name":"Bambudda","address":"99 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"TL;DR\\nGood drinks, decent food, but expensive for the portions -- the Yelp $$ should be $$$ at least. \\n\\nWe came here over the weekend to get a quick snack and drink while waiting for our dinner reservation. Their Dine Out 2016 is currently going on, but we were told that we could order any of the items off that menu al-la-carte if we wanted. So we tried the pork dumplings (with spiced sesame black vinegar) and the lobster and shrimp dumplings (with chipotle mango mayo and cilantro pesto). Both were really good but I leaned more towards the pork dumplings since they were juicier on the inside and came with more liquidy sauce (I'm a saucy kind of gal.) \\n\\nThe drink I had (can't remember the name), was also delicious! It came with a bubbles on top, with a smoky aroma and quite stiff - just the way I like it. \\n\\nThis was the second time I've been to Bambudda. The first time was last year during their Game of Thrones themed drink night. Both times, we've only had drinks and small plates so I can only speak for those.

I've only been twice in the 13 years I've resided in ATL. My most recent visit was no different than the first. The food is nothing  special at all. The service is really slow and the parking is pretty bad as they only have one small lot behind the restaurant. It is very large on the inside so it's a great place if you have a big group to accommodate. It's also an ATL staple so I see why people like trying it but it's nothing great about it.

Sadly they do not live up to the standard set by the Cambridge location.  I went over during the holiday season so there was a huge wait, not unexpected.

First seat they gave us was a random lone booth right by the kitchen doors, even though there were empty tables in the main part of the restaurant. We asked and they moved us, great.  Next up was ordering. I ordered a gluten free pancake which I have had several times at the Cambridge location. Guys, it came out RAW in the center.  The waitress was very polite and went back to the kitchen with it. She came back and informed me the chef said because it was gluten free he could only make it undercooked or burnt. ?!?!  \\n\\nThe only reason I give this place 3 stars is because the waitress was really nice, offered to have it remade, manager came over, etc but I was pretty much done once they told me the chef didn't know how to cook a gluten free pancake.

Oh, Relax--It's not what you think.  Get your mind out of the gutter!\\n\\nWe met up with some friends at Andina for dinner.  Best get reservations--we'd made the mistake of not having any and that's a no-no for a Saturday night here.  After an hour's wait on standby (again, our fault) we were seated at a cozy table down on the basement level (Andina has three floors).  \\n\\nWe started with the Sacsayhuaman (pronounced \\"sexy woman\\", optionally with a suggestive tone), one of Andina's signature cocktails, a delightfully tart passion-fruit drink with habanero pepper-infused vodka, a sugared rim and a small cilantro leaf floating on top.  It wasn't what I'd call \\"spicy\\" but it had just a little warm kick on the finish, and a delightful nip of cilantro accompanied that last sip. Excellent!\\n\\nAfter downing that sexy drink, Wife N moved on to the Ron-yki-on, a grapefruit-lime cocktail with a ginger kick.   Or is it ginger with a grapefruit-lime twist? Either way, this was another excellent drink.  I had the Pisco Sour which had very unique and complementary flavors and lovely egg-white foam on top with a few dashes of Angostura Bitters.\\n\\nWe had several of the tapas plates, starting with the \\"5 Elementos Cebiche\\", raw fish cubes in a citrusy broth they call \\"Leche de tigre\\" accompanied by a small amount of corn and thinly sliced onions.  Very tasty dish that would be particularly ideal for sashimi lovers.\\n\\nOther tapas we tried included the Sopa del dia (soup of the day), a butternut squash with mushrooms and other delightful flavors.  Honestly the best butternut squash soup I've ever tasted.  \\n\\nWe also tried the Conchas a la Parilla, a large (roughly size 6) Diver Scallop with a tamari-butter sauce and shredded crispy onions as a garnish.  The sear on the scallop was absolutely perfect and it was cooked evenly and flawlessly the whole way though. An inch thick, this was one of the best tasting scallops I've ever eaten.  A \\"small\\" gets you a single scallop--so best get a medium (2) or a large (4) if a table of four are partaking.  $10 per scallop seems a tad pricey, but you get what you pay for.\\n\\nWe shared a Quinoa plate with cheese and mushrooms.  I'm not a big fan of quinoa but this was a decent dish--we all agreed this selection would be great for quinoa lovers, but not your \\"average\\" eater.\\n\\nWife, who is a bit pickier and had only a few nibbles of the tapas plates, decided to just order herself a full dinner platter of the Arroz con Pato.  This is the Peruvian version of \\"duck two ways\\"--a perfectly crispy but juicy confit of duck (leg and thigh together) along with a grilled duck breast cooked a perfect medium (to order). It came with a side of cilantro-lime rice and a passionfruit sauce which was heavenly.\\n\\nWe ordered the creme brulee for dessert.  Their creme brulee's come in three different small ramekins on one plate.  Tonight's flavors were vanilla, blackberry, and sweet red pepper.  The Vanilla is exactly what you'd expect for a creme brulee, though we thought it could have been slightly firmer--the taste was spot on.  I've never had flavored creme brulees but the blackberry was good.  Oddly enough, I liked the Red Pepper brulee the best--weird I know, but it really was quite lovely.\\n\\nAs with most tapas restaurants, it's loud.

The guy loves his job and it showed in his service.\\n\\nI've now been out to a number of different tapas restaurants, and I can honestly say that while the competition is stiff, Andina is the best of the bunch.  The food here has the best flavor combinations---well-thought-out spices, heat, and subtleties that left my mouth watering for more, even if my tummy said \\"Umm....you've already eaten too much...\\"  Tapas is not generally cheap food, and Andina is right up there in price.

They all look delicious with their red/black caramelized skins speckled with herbs and spices but so often they fail to deliver on taste.  Even the mass produced HEB rotisserie chickens look appealing.  The only thing more misleading than rotisserie chicken is roasted turkey legs.  I am pleased to share that Inka Chicken delivers on looks AND TASTE as well.  It's not the best rotisserie chicken I have eaten but it may be one of the best I have had in Austin.\\n\\nToday was our first visit and the young man working the counter made a point of preparing a sampling of side items including white rice, Yucca fries, and soft ripe fried plantains for us to try before ordering.  All three were delicious.  I especially liked the Yucca fries.  I like that Inka Chicken offers some exotic side items like the Yucca fries and fried plantains as it is an escape from standard fast food side item offerings.  The chicken is basted in herbs and spices and the skin has a strong chili powder and sage flavoring.  The meat is moist and tender as it should be with a good smokey flavor.  In fact, that smokey aroma permeates through the dining room when you enter Inka Chicken.  They offer two sauces for dipping the chicken both appear to be garlic based but one has more kick as it has jalapeno peppers as a key ingredient.  Both sauces were flavorful and actually tasted better blended together as one of the restaurant staff recommended to us.  I found the sauce was great compliment to the Yucca fries as well. \\n\\nThe cost was very reasonable $6-$7 for quarter chicken plate with a single side or two sides.  Additional menu options allow for family sized meals, tortillas, steak cut fries, mixed vegetables, mac and cheese, and tres leches cake.  I'll try the tortillas and tres leches on my next visit.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff were very cordial and attentive.  Inka Chicken is a fantastic fast food alternative in my opinion.

Upon reviewing the bill we noticed that the restaurant had already charged us an 18% gratuity (which is usually charged to a party of 4 or more but there was just the 2 of us) versus giving us the option to pay what we wanted to pay (which is always at LEAST 20% or MORE). \\nWe came to the conclusion that we were being profiled because we are Black Americans and the restaurant probably assumed that since we are Black Americans that we were either going to under tip or that we were NOT going  to tip at all which was untrue. They assumed that since this is the restaurants busiest night of the week that they would seat us in the bar area which is usually empty and reserve the dining room for the \\"tippers\\". \\nAs we looked around we noticed that everybody else in that particular part of the restaurant was also Black Americans who had probably also unknowingly experienced the same thing. \\nOn top of that, the damned food made me as sick af when I got home.

On the one hand, we could all imagine the pork, game hen, and lamb were from stock raised not far from where we sat enjoying our meal. We could chomp on the tasty bistro fries (served with both a rich truffle-infused aioli and an average not-so-spicy ketchup) and make jokes that the vegetable oil used to cook them was off fueling a tractor somewhere in Canal Winchester. But we also had to sigh with relief that the roasted beet and apple salad actually contained beets (which it hadn't earlier in the week), and sat wondering whether the advertised pistachios in said salad were replaced with toasted pine nuts or diminutive pumpkin seeds. \\n\\nThose concerns aside, our table was served a series of well prepared dishes, portioned to deliver the right amount of food for the Dine Originals format. The bistro frog legs were the lowlight of my meal. Advertised as \\"pan seared to perfection\\", they tasted closer to baked and lacked much defined flavor on their own. The tomato concasse was bright and fresh, adding the right amount of acid to coax the legs into becoming a more complete bite. The cream of duck soup was richly flavored but lacked any actual pieces of duck, besides perhaps the few microscopic scraps that settled at the bottom of the cup. Its robust flavor still managed to get me excited for what was yet to come.\\n\\nKnocking me back and making me want to return most was the shepherd's pie, its coarse mirepoix perfectly accentuating the savory lamb, parsnip puree and shredded potato base. A late audible landed the peanut butter & jelly bread pudding in front of me rather than the chocolate mousse cake. Presented with crumbled peanuts and a ring of jelly-like sauce (hell, it could have just been jelly), it playfully and accurately represented a moist, decadent version of the sandwich itself.\\n\\nBlack Creek Bistro is full of good ideas, good food, and good people.

I love Indian food, so if anything I was set up to like this truck because I enjoy the flavor palette, but I was disappointed. We shared the lamb in a wrap, paneer in a boat, and tater tot chaat.  Overall, the food lacked spice and depth of flavor and the technical execution was inconsistent. The chaat was a cool concept and I love traditional chaat, but the tater tots were soft and the chutneys were bland. Chaat really needs the zing of a good cilantro chutney. I was disappointed because I wanted to like this dish. A friend also got it and his tots were fresher and more crunchy on the outside, so maybe I was just unlucky in that regard. The lamb was ok, but nothing special. There was also very little lamb in my wrap and so the ratio of naan to meat was too doughy. The naan also wasn't very fresh. The paneer was ok, but not memorable. I wanted to like this truck, I liked the menu and the truck itself looked cool, but the food was just kind of dull.

Three meats, spatzle, sauerkraut, and cabbage. We subbed green beans for the cabbage (for most people eating cabbage, sauerkraut and drinking beer will give you ass gas from hell).\\n\\nMy favorite meat is the Sauerbraten. It is a cut of beef that is brined for a week or so in a vinegar based brine then cook slow so the meat is for tender to say the least. It melts in your mouth.\\n\\nI like everything i have had here with a few dishes being exceptional. The on thing i didn't like was their happy hour burger, smiting was on it that made it taste overwhelmingly bitter.\\n\\nAs far as price i think it is very fair. For the feast it is $15.5 or $17.25 per person. The last time i was at Olive garden we spent that much easy and the food is nowhere near as good. Sandwiches are around $10 and i order fondue with bread and order sausage separately so it comes to about $15 bucks but is an appetizer for 4.\\n\\nThe beer menu is one of favorite things here.

After combing fellow Yelper reviews for the most raved about dishes, I let everyone at the table know that they needed to trust me as I ordered several small plates. They were ALL amazing, and while my main dish was also really good I think next time I'll stick with the small plates and drinks and leave it at that. \\n\\nStarters:\\nPimiento Piquillo Relleno- 1/per person is ideal, you don't want to share these delicious peppers stuffed with quinoa, cheese, and jamon serrano. Delicious.\\nMixta Nikkei Causa- served cold, so don't get caught off-guard. Beautifully presented and very flavorful. I really dug this dish but it was the least favorite at the table.\\nTuna Nikkei Cebiche- WINNER! We were fighting for the last bite of this deliciously marinated, somewhat spicy mix of tuna and refreshing veggies\\nBread- Comes with your meal, and while the bread wasn't that special the 3 sauces that accompany said bread are amazing\\n\\nAs far as the mains go, I wasn't unimpressed I just wished I would have ordered more of the starters instead. I ordered the Lomo Saltado, and while it was really good it was essentially a beef stir-fry. A really good beef stir-fry though. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a flavorful meat dish. The drinks were enjoyed by all, order anything off their classic or new inventions and you'll be pleased (I can personally vouch for the Caipirinha and Pisco Sour).\\n\\nThe service was spot-on and professional, and we were sat promptly upon arrival. Be sure to make reservations, this place is always busy. The only two things I would warn picky diners about are the noise level (a quiet dining experience this is not) which I actually enjoy, and the outdated bathrooms (they aren't awful, they just don't mesh with the finer dining experience on the other side of the door)."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I definitely enjoy the pizza here, it is closest thing I can get to a slice from NYC. I came here after a recommendation and wasnt disappointed. I come here often and the consistentcy is pretty good at times not enough salt or sauce on a plain cheese, but it was never major to make me not try again. The pizza is expensive for Austin...even for NYC @ $3 for a regular slice. I do like the atmosphere, the spot is always crowded and they have NYC icons in the paintings on the background like Run DMC. However for being a NY thueme pizza restaurant it definitely has a strong Austin vibe. In NY when you want a cheese slice you would say \\"lemme get a slice\\" it iris me when every time I order like that they say \\"what toppings do you want?\\" I've learned to conform and just say a cheese slice. I highly recommend this place. It would be mice if they had Zeppelis and garlic knots. Those are staples in pizza joints in NYC.

They have a nice back patio where you can wait and order apps until your table comes.

My wife and I love Lee and Rick's however after today I may have to reconsider.  We went their with our two sons, their first time, and took a table so as to not hog 4 places at the bar being that they were not having oysters.  We were greeted promptly and our drink orders were taken and delivered.  Our waiter Jeremy then came over to take our food order.  My wife ordered one dozen oysters and I ordered two dozen.  Our sons ordered the mussel basket and the crab cakes.  Their food came out very quickly.  The mussel basket was served with some that were not opened.  Knowing that you don't eat shellfish that do not open, we put those aside.  Clue number one things were going down hill.  The crab cakes were just a bit more flavorful than a hockey puck.  Really nothing but frozen, flash fried nasty mush.  Our oysters came out a while after.  My wife got her dozen but I only received one dozen.  Jeremy was gone like the wind as soon as he dropped off the oysters so I never was able to ask about my second dozen.  The oysters were as good as always of course.  Some on the small side but I am ok with that as long as they are tasty.  We finished eating and the wait began.  Five, ten, fifteen minutes later I finally had to go and ask about getting our bill.  No one ever came back to check on us or offer us refills on drinks.  The cashier called for our waiter and I waited at the register five more minutes for him to show up and give us our bill.  We wanted to order three more dozen but I sure was not going to dedicate my life to waiting on him to assist us.  I paid and tipped accordingly.  The cashier was semi-apologetic but did not really seem to care.  So, I would suggest that unless you only want oysters and are going to sit at the bar forget about Lee and Rick's.

Unfortunately it doesn't check all the boxes for me, but it's good by New England standards.\\n\\nOne of the first things that put me off was the complexity of the menu. There is so much going on here, it will make your head spin. There's like five different funky bread choices, and every menu item has some quirky twist or ingredient to it. I just want an omelette that isn't $14 with some sourdough toast. I ended up getting the monster breakfast, which is two pieces of French toast, eggs, a meat (bacon, of course), and home fries. You get to choose from the funky bread list for the French toast, so I went with the cayenne cheddar, against the waitress' recommendation. Man am I glad I didn't listen to her, the French toast was AMAZING. The rest of the plate was just alright. The eggs were undercooked and barely had any cheese that I asked for. Bacon was bacon, and the home fries were good.\\n\\nService was fine both times, nothing bad to say. The decor of the place may give you nausea, it looks like a clown's bedroom. There is crap everywhere - on the walls, on top of the booths, on the tables, in display cases, on the floor, on the ceiling, behind the bar, on the windows, it's too much. I get they're going for that classic diner vibe, but it doesn't work for me. Menu pricing is a bit absurd for a diner and the food they're serving. My monster breakfast came out to $16.

This one is for the latter reason.  I gave it two stars because the bartender was friendly, and our waitress was really sweet, albeit unhelpful.  The rooftop really is beautiful if you can ever get up there (it has been closed or reserved for a private party when I went.  I have only been up there under the prior ownership).  I wish I could have tasted the food -- twice I have gone and left before even placing an order. \\n\\nI met a group of ladies to have food and drinks on the rooftop cabana (on a Monday night).  One of the ladies called ahead to reserve.  We arrived at said time and were told rooftop wouldn't open for another hour.  We were good sports about it and waited at the bar for about an hour and a half.  After hour and a half at the bar, we asked about the cabana and was told it would be another hour.  We were given several different reasons, including that not enough people showed up for work (not exactly something you tell the customers) and the owner was out of town and didn't want to open the rooftop (does the owner not leave anyone in charge when he leaves?).  Each staff member we asked about it blamed its not opening on another staff member.  \\n\\nWhile waiting at the bar we were told there is no cocktail menu, and I personally found the food item combinations to be kind of odd (no points deducted for that though).  The rooftop finally opened, but we were told we couldn't have food there -- only hookah.  And then we were told something about them having to carry the liquor from the downstairs bar upstairs to the rooftop bar.  I though it was just another excuse, until I saw an employee carrying buckets of ice from downstairs bar to upstairs.  We were losing patience, but still trying to be good sports!\\n\\nWe finally asked for seating in the main dining room (about 60% empty), and a waitress told us she was not allowed to give out tables.  Member of our group walked over to the hostess and asked for table for a party of 7.  We were squeezed into a booth.  We clearly did not all fit comfortably, so we asked about one of the other several empty, larger tables.  We were told it was a \\"different section.\\"  What that meant, I have no idea.  We were seated and received no menus.  (We had turned in the ones we had at the bar).  Before we got menus we were told about their no check-splitting policy.  I asked the waitress to speak to a manager about that since they only allowed use of three methods of payment per one check, and we were not interested in using the ATM and paying surcharge to get cash to pay.  In the meantime, we asked for menus and ice water.  A different (also friendly) waitress came back with three (3) menus that she \\"was able to find,\\" for our party of 7.  Remember, the restaurant was more than half empty.  Our waitress came back with more menus, and once again asked us if we wanted drinks.  We reminded her about the waters. \\n\\nI ended up dealing with a very disinterested, unprofessional \\"manager\\" when I asked if we could split the party into two checks, since only 2 of the seven of us had cash and everyone else had credit cards, exceeding their three methods of payment per check policy. Granted, a policy is a policy, no matter how arbitrary.  But the manager's attitude was inappropriate, and customer service was not her forte.  I told her I wouldn't order anything if she couldn't allow the second check, and clearly she could not have cared less about me and my gripes with paying $5.00 surcharge to get cash from ATM.  If the place was swamped, I would not have bothered, but it was not busy.  In fact several servers were sitting around chatting with one another.  I kept my word and left as soon as our waitress had finished taking the other ladies' orders.\\n\\nI've dined at restaurants all over Atlanta, Miami, and DC.

Our red-haird, total townie bartender greeted us with the THICKEST of Bahston brogues (How ah yah?

The oysters in my roll were plump and juicy, the coleslaw creamy and unhealthy, and the beers...well, beery. Mike kept up an easy patter with us and our adjoining bar-mates, and M. and I reminisced about the good old days while some sports event or other played on the old TV above the bar.   Bartender Mike was friendly and competent, which is more than I can say for most of the restaurant folk in Miami; he was a font of lore about the politician regulars from nearby City Hall and regaled us with tales of his no-good fellow waiters.\\n\\nWe turned down an offer for Boston Cream Pie (Mike, to his credit, was not surprised) and left, a bit lodgy from all the grease but happy to have spent some time in that venerable Boston institution.

He said it's a great place to grab a burrito, a beer and watch the game. I had previously sampled his wife's delicious cooking, so I knew he had something good & authentic to compare it to. I wasn't sure what game he was referring to at the time, but I later found out he meant soccer, specifically Chivas. All this favorable talk gave Boulevard Tacos credibility in my book, but I was never particularly motivated to go there because of it's proximity to my go-to Mexican joint, Javier's.\\n\\nFinally, I went on Sunday morning for hungover breakfast and now I feel pretty dumb for not going sooner. I would never get the tacos at Javier's because I believe $2 is pricey for a classic taco, but at Blvd., they are reasonably priced at around $1.50. They aren't exactly traditional tacos, but they aren't too off the beaten path either. The Azteca taco is $1.50 and comes with pico de gallo, cheese and guacamole.  They have a fancier taco called a fajitas taco which comes with  grilled veggies, cheese and guacamole for $1.75. Their meat selection is pretty basic too, no brain or cheek, but there is tongue.\\n\\nI ordered 2 Azteca tacos, asada and carnitas. 1 fajitas taco, pollo, and 1 pastor taco. The Azteca tacos did not come with cheese although it's stated on menu and the guacamole is more of an avocado sauce you'll find in the salsa bar of a lot of taquerias. The pico de gallo was a nice touch, but I'd rather just have it in the salsa bar so I can adjust the amount myself. Nitpicking aside, both meats were very good and the tacos were fully loaded.  \\n\\nThe pastor taco was the most traditional of the tacos, 2 tortillas, meat, cilantro and onion. Unfortunately it was also a little disappointing- the pastor lacked in flavor and was missing the gallo and guac sauce.\\n\\nThe stand out was definitely the fajita taco. Although more expensive, it was loaded with cheese and veggies that were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Also the chicken was very juicy and flavorful which is a rarity. I almost never get pollo tacos as usually they're dry or rubbery. Of all the meats I had, this was my favorite. \\n\\nThey have an extensive vegetarian menu as well. My veg room mate says their veggie burrito has too much lettuce so he opted for the veggie nachos which were loaded high and only $5\\n\\nThe salsa bar could use a definite beefing up though. The verde sauce is more spicy than flavorful and they need some pickled onions and carrots. However, the cilantro and onions were fresh and bountiful. \\n\\nBeing open late with reasonably priced tacos and having a late night happy hour is going to make Boulevard Tacos a new addition to my repertoire. I can't wait to grab some tacos, a beer, and watch the game in their spartan bar!"},{"name":"Ask For Luigi","address":"305 Alexander Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Amazing experience ..

I've eaten here a few times, but not recently. After going here a few times, I decided it wasn't that great for the price you pay...

It's June and pretty hot outside and I was dressed in office attire so I wanted to sit indoors. Only two tables were available and both sat up to 4 people. The man behind the counter asked if I would mind sitting outside because they wanted to reserve the 4-person tables for \\"larger parties.\\" I thought to myself \\"you know, I don't HAVE to eat here\\" but I was waiting for my fiance so I stayed. The server said he knew it was stupid but said the owner would \\"get mad\\" at him. Sounds like an abusive, stingy boss to me... \\n\\nMy fiance printed out a couple coupons for a gyro with fries and drink for $5.00 each. We may not have even used them, but the owner saw them on the table and said he would not accept those coupons unless they came from the newspaper at UCF. Okaayyy...these were coupons available online, designed to be printed out, and nowhere did it say they would not be honored...no asterisk or anything. Just an expiration date of 6-28-10.\\n\\nWe decided to leave and go to a place across the street (Pom Pom's teahouse and sandwicheria) where they have a clue how to treat customers.

And yes, his awesomeness does relate to this review (although I would say it even if it didn't apply).\\n\\nLast night was the 11 month anniversary of our first date (roll your eyes all you want, you're just jealous), and we'd been talking about trying The Optimist sometime soon, so this seemed like a perfect opportunity.  Except we had no reservation.\\n\\nThis is where he becomes my knight in shining armor: he called the restaurant after they reopened for dinner after 5 PM, after ascertaining there were no reservations available at 7:30, launched into a story about how \\"it was our anniversary\\" (the actual number was unimportant), we both wanted to try it so much, could they possibly squeeze us in?  And lo and behold a reservation at 7:30 PM for that very evening materialized!  How great is he?  Super great!!\\n\\nSo this was going to be a 5 star meal no matter what just because of him.  We arrived right on time and as promised, the table was ready.  The restaurant is very cool - the main dining room is one large, airy room with an upscale 'warehouse feel' due to the exposed industrial ceiling (it's trendy and the kind of thing you'd expect in the Fourth Ward or West Midtown, for sure).  A giant bar occupies one end of the room, and the semi-open kitchen takes up the other end with tables, booths and banquettes scattered throughout the middle.  As soon as you enter (next to the putting green outside - where I've heard putters are available by request), there is another bar near the hostess stand for people waiting for a table, or those who are looking for a quick drink or appetizer.   \\n\\nWe were seated and quickly our waitress came over to wish us a happy anniversary, and give us a little history about The Optimist.  The deal is that all the fish is fresh daily, wild caught and what happens to be in season, consequently, the menu changes on an almost daily basis.  Good deal.  \\n\\nService was excellent all night, from the moment we sat down until we got back into the car handed over by the valet.  Everyone was friendly, warm and attentive.\\n\\nAfter we'd had a chance to look at the menu, I had a Sparkly Motion cocktail (a mix of Cava, pomegranate grenadine and pomegranate seeds - bubbly and yum!), and my boyfriend had the Winter on Cape Cod (vodka, cranberry juice, cranberries and spices - also yum!).  \\n\\nThen, we got down to business: I knew we had to order the shrimp a la plancha with sopping toast (even though it was messy, so many reviews said to get it), and for main dishes: the duck fat poached swordfish and glazed short rib (we shared these two), with a side of bok choy.  \\n\\nBefore the shrimp arrived, we also were treated to some of the best yeast rolls I've had in recent memory - I don't know what kind of crack cocaine was in these, but boy, were they good!  \\n\\nAnd the shrimp were indeed messy, spicy and absolutely worth it.  The 'sopping' toast was covered in all of the sauce and spices the shrimp were sauteed in and it was delicious too.  Apparently, everyone gets equally messy attempting to eat this because our waitress brought around a plate of hot towels with lemon for us to wipe our hands off with afterwards (I, naturally, nearly gave my fingers third degree burns trying to unfurl the steaming hot towel too soon, but it worked very well once it had cooled to a handle-able temperature).\\n\\nOur entrees were equally fantastic - the swordfish (which is a very firm fish) was artfully presented on a bed of celery root puree and a garlic chili relish - it was great.  The chili sauce was a perfect touch of spice to the mildness of the fish and celery root.  And the glazed short rib was tender, juicy and rich with perfectly roasted pearl onions accenting it.  Even the bok choy, which both of us are a fan of already, was uniquely prepared.  Only tiny baby bok choy were employed and prepared in such a way that they were flavored with chilis and ginger.  So tasty.\\n\\nWe were both quite full by the time we were done but then the dessert menu was revealed.  Damn.  You only have an 11 month anniversary once, right?  The apple buckle won out, and when it was presented to us it came complete with a candle.  So sweet!\\n\\nAnd the dessert was top of the line: a little dish of apples, cinammon and cake was layered and covered with a streusel crust that included a hint of sharp cheddar cheese (great combination of sweet and tart) and baked until piping hot, then a scoop of sweet cream ice cream was added to finish it off.  Fan-freaking-tastic!!\\n\\nEverything last night could not have been better.  It really was perfect.

Outdoor area is very nice.   I will add a disclaimer - the \\"buzz\\" about King & Duke has been centered on a happy hour, weekend outdoor drinking scene and I have been there three times with friends solely for that.   I would give it four stars for being a nice outdoor area, but only three stars for having a much smaller area than its predecessor, Nava.   I think King and Duke should have maximized the outdoor area and created small broken up zones for socializing, much like the interior of Fado - which took a large space, but turned it into a number of discrete intimate small spaces.   As for the food, I went through the menu, and I wasn't bowled over by the offerings.   I asked two people sitting next to me at the bar how they  enjoyed the hanger steak (she said not very much) and the other woman had the lamb and said it was \\"all right\\".   Neither was a ringing endorsement.  Both looked like they would not order those two dishes again.   I will go back for a full on dinner and re-assess my rating.   As a place to go, it is nice because it is within a 100 yards of UMI and the St. Regis, so it has some appeal if you want limited crowd hopping.

Mac n cheese was blah, there are other places that have far better mac (Jim N Nicks and Who's Got Soul immediately come to mind) hell MY Mac n cheese is better. Corn muffins, blah. Sweet bread blah. Starter salad...bwahahaha! All can be made from a quick trip to Publix. We had a sweet potato souffl√© that was pretty good but again, it was comparable to what Publix sells in their bakery during the holidays. For dessert we had peach cobbler that was just ok. The pros about this place are the customer service and the sweet tea. Awesome sweet tea! And I was fortunate enough to park in the back rather than on the street. All in all I really don't see what the hype is?? The food was as basic as it comes. I'm just glad I didn't pay my own money to dine here."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped in for breakfast after seeing the reviews and really liked the vibe, definitely a Austin original.

The lower level was already nearly full and we we were seated upstairs in the mezzanine second bar area. The interior is very bar louie esque but slightly smaller. Top 40 music blaring which didn't bother me but I know some will be annoyed. Their menu is pretty impressive - light years better than bar Louie and if this is the direction of chain restaurants, I'm down. We took forever to order but went with the duck wings, build your own burger, a salad and side of maple bacon Mac and cheese and fried green beans. The ducks wings were awesome. Tons of meat with no funky sketchy or chewy bites. Even the skin was deliciously crisp and edible. The bf didn't think they were hot but I found the spice level to be just perfect for me. Enough duck that by itself it'd be plenty for one person as a meal. For our meal I just went with their house salad and side of maple bacon Mac. The Mac is pretty heavy and filling and a good side portion for the price. Loved the slight maple flavor. I like how all their sides are $2-$3 and honestly you could build yourself a meal out of sides here as they all sound appealing. I tried the bf's burger and it was well a burger. He said it was an 89 out of 100 and he'd come back for another. The fried green beans were super yummy. Not overly fried and beans were still crisp and fresh with a nice sweet and spicy Asian sauce drizzled on top. I'm eyeing the lobster and asparagus Mac and cheese or the fried chicken and waffles for our next visit. Bf enjoyed 2 beers forget the kind for $6 a pop (menu only lists prices for wine which is verrrry annoying). My house merlot was 6.5.

Slices of cooked squid in a mixture of lime juice, tomato, onion, spices, and fresh mint leaves. This was the first time I have had this, and my only regret was not daring to try it sooner. What an original taste. Not something you could eat everyday or finish a large portion of in one seating, but still worth trying multiple times. Not only did it look amazing with its colours and perfectly sliced up squid, but it was not like anything I have ever tried. It was as refreshing as it was hard to describe. \\nWonderfully fresh, the vinaigrette tasted just like apple, which accentuated the mint leaves perfectly. I concluded this was in part due to the the stringy crunchy bits, of what I assume was apple flesh shredded into a string like consistency. The squid absorbed all this great flavour and added a great chew with its rubbery texture. The owner mentioned throwing in extra tomatoes, which was great as I passed on the hard cabbage leaves. \\n\\n\\"Pad Thai\\". Pan fried Thai rice noodles in a tamarind sauce with prawns, egg, tofu, bean sprouts, green onion, and topped with peanuts. The most well known dish in Thai cuisine, and the best measuring stick to judge the quality of a Thai restaurant; as everyone on them serves this classic. I cannot describe it better than to say that this was honestly the best pad Thai I have had. It was light in flavour and light in texture. A meal you would eat and not feel full or guilty as it sat in your stomach. The freshness of the ingredients was apparent. Juicy well seasoned prawns that never once overwhelmed the noodles. Bean sprouts that snapped with crispiness as you bit into them. Delicious. \\n\\n\\nWould I come back? - Yes. \\nWould I recommend it? - Yes. \\nAt an convenient to get to location with enough surrounding parking, it is at a good location. And seeing as it is still new and doesn't attract too much attention on the block, chances are you don't need a reservation or to wait for a table. The prices aren't cheap, but they definitely justify the taste of the food. Delicious seasonings, fresh ingredients, this was high end Thai.

Some guy that worked there came up to the table (I'm not sure if he was a busboy, worked in the kitchen or what) and told us that we needed to leave so he could clear the tables and that they were closed at 9:30 so we had to get out or go to the bar.  Whoa....what? It was 10:15. We hadn't been camped out for hours at the table, an hour and 15 minutes seems to be a perfectly reasonable amount of time to eat your dinner, at least that's what I would think. There were also two other tables in the dining room that were still eating so we weren't the last ones there or anything. When we had ordered, our waitress had told us that the kitchen closed at 9:30 so to go ahead and put in an order for anything we would want at that time. She also assured us that there was no rush and that we could take our time. So I'm totally confused by this guy that tried to rush us out. I've never been treated so rudely in a restaurant ever before. Management: do not take 9pm reservations if you are trying to close at 9:30. An hour and a half is a pretty standard amount of time for a table to take so that puts you at 10:30 and if your staff is so anxious to get the hell out of there at 9:30 that's not going to work. \\nFYI The guy who was so rude to us was bald with lots of tattoos and was working in one of the upstairs dining rooms.

Some people might say there's too much rice vs. non-rice on the plate, but a way to get around that is to get something with sauce (instead of being just fried) so all the rice is tasty.

What the actual hell? I was so thrown off by this response that the words that came out of my mouth were \\"but if I can't eat the food, the presentation won't matter...\\" She proceeded to tell me she'd just do \\"no cheese\\" instead of having it on the side like I asked (my boyfriend eats dairy and would have liked the goat cheese). \\n\\nThe next thing I ordered was the coconut shrimp and a side of the green salad. She said the green salad had a parmesan vinaigrette and made no attempt to accommodate my needs by offering another dressing instead (usually restaurants have olive oil or apple cider vinegar).

I've never had the redback, so I can't say if it's supposed to be a fishier tasting fish, but it was fishy.  The shrimp was in an \\"xo sauce\\" that tasted more cajun than Chinese.

I LOVE The Optimist and was excited to try his restaurant.  I think this was a case of the place being overhyped in advance of my visit.  First off, can we all agree that a semi-rude hostess is annoying beyond belief?   I don't get why restaurants put up with and/or promote the first experience with your establishment is to be greeted by someone who acts annoyed at having to greet you and take you to your table.  But on to the food - bread service was fab.  Popovers were excellent.  The appetizer of bacon and the peach marmalade was delicious.  Was a little disappointed in the server- again to compare to The Optimist, the service is always amazing - our server for our party of four was less than attentive and seemed to lose interest in us once we said we were not big on the rabbit recommendation.  I did the steak and fries.  Steak arrived lukewarm & a bit on the chewy side, fries were hot and very tasty.  Scallops were reported to be delicious.  Fish special of bass was good, but felt the portion was a bit on the tiny side for the $29 price tag.  Desserts were outstanding.    We decided if we went back, we would do appetizer, salad and some of the great looking sides and dessert.  Entrees just didn't have enough oomph to them to want to try again.

You can choose to eat by the plate or challenge yourself and get your moneys worth with the all you can eat option. I tend to eat by the plate and try to eat less then the all you can eat place...I don't like the feeling of being ridiculously full so having a price cap helps portion control. This place is great for kids because they have a series of rolls that are only 1.50/plate and have four pieces on them. My favorite roll is a crunch California roll which is a California roll that has been tempura battered and fried. My only recommendation is if you're planning on getting something that is supposed to be eaten hot or warm to order it yourself cause you will be most likely disappointed when you pull it off the belt and its cold and soggy. Also the chocolate cake is not as dry as it looks. All in all its a halfway decent eatery that is ideal for lunch breaks from work since you can eat right away and dip out to do other things on your break ;)"},{"name":"D'Amelio‚Äôs Restaurant","address":"306 Revere St","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"Just recently tried this place and am so glad Revere got a nice restaurant!  The food was pretty much as good as it gets.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a huge Italian food connoisseur, and there's definitely a large selection of good Italian restaurants in the Boston area.  But I was really impressed and this could become a local fav for me since I will be moving to Revere next month.  I thought the sauce was spot-on.  I would have been happy just dipping bread in it.  The homemade pasta was delicious and perfectly cooked.  The portions were huge.  The seafood dish my boyfriend ordered had a nice big lobster tail on top (which you don't see too often).  In fact, they have a really large selection of seafood dishes which is perfect for the Revere Beach area.\\n\\nThey also wouldn't stop giving us bread!  I don't know if they had just cooked too much and it was going to go bad or something.  But they kept bringing more bread and offering to bring more bread.  Then when I took my food to-go, they added more bread to my doggy bad!  The bread was pretty standard Italian-style bread (not like my go-to fav, Bertucci's bread, which must have coke in it because it's so addicting), but still pretty good.  They brought over olive oil in a cute little dispenser for dipping.  (Also, let's be honest, you don't want the bread to be too good because you want to enjoy your meal and everyone's watching their carbs these days.)\\n\\nThe service was perfect.  The waiter was super friendly and attentive.  And there seemed to be an army of people to bring water, bread, and food as needed.  Everyone also greeted us as we entered and said goodbye when we left.\\n\\nThe interior decor was really nice.  It reminded me of an old-school, high-end steak house like Abe & Louie's but with a modern touch.\\n\\nThe one thing I wasn't super fond of was the valet parking.  It is free but you obviously should tip the parker.  It's also strange because the parking lot is not that big so I feel like I could have easily parked myself?  You also still need to cross the street to go to the restaurant.  In general, I choose to self-park even when the valet parking is free because it just makes me more comfortable.

Once inside you have a little bit of time to see the doughnuts before you are actually at the counter. The doughnuts themselves are so outlandish in toppings and flavors. I did appreciate that they also offered regular flavors and styles along with the crazy ones. I think overall in doughnut quality these are pretty good. The prices were pretty reasonable too.

I gave it the two-try-test- of course the first time it blows your socks off could be a fluke- but this second round was just as mouth-wateringly delicious as the first.  Here's the thing, as a pizza aficionado and one who has difficulty making it one week without pie, I have my own system for judging the merit of a certain pizza establishment.  There are three categories: delivery (domino's, pizza hut, and other such crap), regional (New York style like Home Slice, Chicago style, Detroit style, etc), and gourmet (Backspace and Dough in SA).  Via 313 obviously falls into the regional category, and I must say that I think it's every bit as good as Home Slice.  Granted, it's different styles, but every bit as amazing in its own right.  Enough so that it kicks Home Slice right off its little high horse.  The dough is tender, the cheese is gooey, the ladled sauce on top is perfectly fresh and savory, the shake of oregano is aromatic and complimentary, and the best part- the cheesy, crispy edges.  No crust!  I mean, who needs crust?  It's just bread.  Via 313's cheese goes all the way to the edges, and gets all baked and crunchy, adding depth of flavor to the pizza.  Heaven, sheer heaven.  Since the first time I had it, I thought about it whenever pizza was mentioned, and I'm happy, more than happy, thrilled to share my experience with fellow yelpers.  This pizza is some of the best in Austin, hands down.  Plus, Brandon, one of the owners, was super nice and genuinely thankful that we loved his pizza.

ANYWAY...I got the eggs benedict with the pulled pork and jalapeno hollandaise (on the side) and it was tasty. Sadly I thought the pork lacked a little flavor, but enjoyed the dish overall and appreciated that I wasn't complete uncomfortably full like I can be at a lot of places in town (though that can be attributed to my lack of self discipline for not stopping when I am full and enjoying food too much vs portion size).\\nThere was also a DJ while we had brunch, which I found kind of cool, he got a little louder toward noon as the restaurant filled and the wait list began.\\nI would definitely go back to try some of the other items I have heard too!"},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"On my first morning in Boston, I woke up early (8a), braved the unexpectedly savage wind (guess who didn't pack a jacket), and embarked on the 30-minute walk through blossom-filled gardens to The Paramount.  \\n\\nWhen I got there, the tables were already full of perky families and the line stretched to the door.  This afforded me sufficient time to obsessively search through Yelp reviews to decide on what to order.  I settled on the following:\\n\\n1. Texas Style French Toast ($6) with Fruit on Top (+$4) and Real Maple Syrup (+$2) - The fruit was plentiful and very artfully arranged on three thick slices of vanilla rich, buttery french toast.  I enjoyed the upgraded syrup, but I'm not sure I could discern a large margin of difference vs. standard syrup\\n\\n2. Turkey Sausage ($4) - I thought I'd be able to get by with just the French Toast, but my food lust was instantly inflamed by the sight of the chefs using ice cream scoops to drop fresh turkey sausage onto the griddle.

I decided to return before our visit to Chihuly nights at the botanical gardens. We got there and decided to sit at the counter, opposed to ordering in line. After our initial visit, seeing the spot on Atlanta eats I thought why not. The bartender arrived after a few minutes and we were ready to go. We ordered everything at once to make it easy, my girlfriend ordered the veggie burger, a few toppings, a Coke and decided to start with the fried pickles (which are awesome). Me being a rookie, went downtown the menu and ordered a build your own burger. Beef, double party, lettuce, raw onion, bacon and pickle, seems simple enough. Toward the game end of the order the bartender states, ok, you want the grindhouse burger. Assuming he knew better than me and has been clearly doing this for a while I agreed and ordered my Coke. The drinks came, mine was half full, after 2 sips it was gone. Waited a few minutes for his return, he didn't so I decided to refill from the self service station. Pickles came out and we're as I remembered from the last visit. 5 stars. This is where it goes sideways, when the burger comes out it is dripping with cheese, I stated I didn't order cheese, he replied oh I'm sorry I thought you ordered the grindhouse burger. No sir, I told you what I wanted and you said grindhouse burger. So after them returning it due to it having cheese I waited as my girlfriend began to eat. 2nd try, the burger comes back out, no cheese but grilled onion, not raw, and sauce all over the burger. Not sure where the disconnect was. After calling him back over and reviewing what I had ordered the attitude went into full gear. I politely asked to start over and once again ordered a build your own burger. After the huffs and puffs he reordered my burger. After mentioning keeping the fries thinking it would be a quick fix, my girlfriend was then finished as I sat and waited. Not to be checked on, apologized to for the confusion, instead the next interaction I apologized for the confusion. Really ? As my fries and the 2nd attempted burger sat in front of me the 3rd burger came out. As I ate the burger I was never checked on until completion, the fries were cold from sitting, and my girlfriend and I might as well have went alone, as we ate alone. When finished he quickly came over asked anything else and handed me a bill for 23.71. Really ? After your repeated failures to get it right. Not being cheap, not wanting to complain I paid the bill and tipped 6.39 on that tab. There are so many options in Atlanta.

I had not been to the Candler Park location in years because it opens late (9am).  Here are my impressions:\\n\\nDecor-  Nicely done, but the floor needs to be re-treated.  It is heavily waxed and slick.  Be careful when you go there so that you don't slip and fall.  This is a liability issue management should fix immediately.\\n\\nMenu- Limited, but with some unique options.  I would like to see an expansion of the menu with maybe some skillet dishes and more pancake choices.  Buckwheat is not for me, buttermilk is boring and gluten-free is a fad.  How about apple-cinnamon, lemon, ginger or pineapple for pancake flavors?  Also,egg dishes should come with potatoes, fruit, grits or some other side.  I had to order potatoes al a carte with my scramble.\\n\\nFlavors-  Excellent.  This is Radial's strength.  I has the Gouda Scramble (with bacon) while the wife had French Toast.  The coffee was competent.  The scramble was fresh and the bacon flavor came out with each bite.  Caramelized onions in the scramble made it memorable.  It was one of the best scrambles I have eaten.  The wife reports that the French toast was tasty.    \\n\\nThe potatoes need work.  Radial serves deep fried potato bits (think Shoney's square potatoes, except the Radial potato bits are half that size).  The potatoes are not seasoned very well.  I has to salt and pepper them a couple of times.  Two tips-  don't deep fry the potatoes and season them (ie rosemary, onions, or green onions, etc.).  Red skin potato chunks work best.  You can even buy them in the frozen aisle at Kroger.  They beat most restaurant potatoes.        \\n\\nPortion size-  This is where Radial loses 2 stars.  A \\"full\\" order of French Toast is two tiny slivers of challah bread.  The pieces were about 6 inches long, 2 inches wide and about 1&1/2 inches thick.  At $8.29, each silver of French Toast costs $4.15.  This was by far the worst value for our money of any item I ordered at any breakfast restaurant in the Atlanta area.  A full order should be 6 of these pieces.  My wife was still hungry when we left.  My scramble was rather small for a three-egger.  I suspect they used medium eggs.  That the scramble only came with bread made it less of a value.  It was not as bad of a value as the French toast, but it needs improvement.  Try adding a side to the scramble and using large eggs.  \\n\\nService-  Fairly good and prompt.  No problems waiting for menus, drinks or food.  Good on coffee refills.  \\n\\nOutlook- I would like to add Radial to my weekend rotation of breakfast joints,  However, they have to address the portion size issue.  I am not looking for a mess of flavorless glob, just a little more value for my dollar.  As we left at 9:30 on a Sunday morning, I noticed the lack of a breakfast rush.  I am afraid that Radial will close its doors on the southside like so many other restaurants.  It has the potential to be a good one.  However, the Thumbs Up in nearby East Point will eat its lunch as long as Radial's portion sizes remain Lilliputian."},{"name":"The Steakburger","address":"7120 NE Hwy 99","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"W side of NE Hwy. 99 S of NE 78th St.\\n\\nI don't know what it is exactly... perhaps it is the whole package(experience) that makes me such a fan of this place.\\n\\nThe food will not blow you away by any stretch of the imagination and neither will their fairly limited menu.

The inside tables are made up of booths.\\n\\nThey feature Pepsi Products and the Fountain Machine is located by the napkins and condiments.\\n\\nNot really much in the decor department. They really should work on that.... perhaps something like a 50s Diner. There are lots of news clippings of their success stories through the years. Normally I don't really care about decor, but I think a central theme in this place would certainly  make things a bit more lively so to speak.... you know give it some character!\\n\\nOn my most recent visit I started off with some of their warm and fluffy Onion Rings: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakburger-vancouver?select=m3cAci6QVM4izCBci7uQkA#WG8PE8j4-wyV7Po4Qr92cg These are the kind I like. Probably not homemade, but that's ok because I still enjoyed them thoroughly. The batter wasn't greasy, the crust was warm and crunchy, and the onions inside were hot and tender making for a most delicious side (at $3.50 they better be though!)\\n\\nFor my burger I went with their Jumbo Steakburger: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakburger-vancouver?select=m3cAci6QVM4izCBci7uQkA#hOH_rbXCLEZ9ZTjTKcNwIg to which as you can see I added ham for a $1 more (I think ham on their burger used to be their thing, but I'm gathering that perhaps the added saltiness might have been somewhat of a deterrent.) It looks pretty much like your standard burger and it pretty much is. It had a thin patty that was a little bit larger than usual, but didn't have any discernible seasoning about it. I'd say it was probably cooked about medium-well which is a little more than I prefer, but oh well... the burger still proved fairly juicy and fairly flavorful. It wasn't a bad burger it just wasn't an awesome burger. I wish they used a better quality ham because the piece that I had was way too salty it almost overpowered as opposed to complementing the other ingredients of the burg!\\n\\nThey have a ton of different flavors of shakes (that could be made thicker or into malts for an additional charge) and I'd certainly like to see what those are about.\\n\\nI ended up spending almost $13 bucks on 3 items which seems kind of high to me.

Blech: paneer was like rubber, pakoras and naan were precooked and hard, the yellow saffron rice dessert seemed really hard and greasy.  Overall, the dishes didn't seem freshly cooked.  Salad section looked pretty sad.  Also, don't be fooled by the steam.  The steam is from hot water from the steam table, and not necessarily the food!  \\n\\nValue 2/5: With dinner buffet at $16, it's hardly worth it.  Only reason I came was because I had a 2 for 1 Entertainment coupon.  With taxes and tip, it was $10, which is acceptable.  But really, for $10, I still have a few other good options in the city.\\n\\nService 3/5: Prompt and friendly.  Would be helpful if they had small bowls for dessert and sauces.\\n\\nAmbiance 3/5: Clean.  Interior could use some updating.  There's a patio and a stellar view of downtown.  Come for a beer on the patio on a sunny day.  Just don't expect much from the food!\\n\\nOverall 2/5.  I knew what I was getting into, but still, it's disappointing when food is lousy."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great food!

I went to this location one afternoon. It wasn't too busy, but it wasn't empty either. The waitress was nice, but as the night progressed, I couldn't help but get the feeling that we were being a little neglected. After the order, it was a while until we saw her again. I ordered the pulled pork plate with the mac and cheese and the collard greens. My brother ordered the rib plate with the coleslaw and the corn. Lets start with my order. The pulled pork was good, but a bit dry. Not much of an issue, but worth mentioning. Out of all the sauces, I would definitely say the Carolina (mustard base) sauce was the best. The collard greens were delicious, but I found a bone the size of my finger in there that was from a larger bone, but it was broken to that size. The mac and cheese wasn't anything to rant and rave about however. It was OK. In fact, it was barely warm when I received it. The ribs....These ribs were NOT on my top list of ribs. My brother can usually eat a full rack of ribs. He ordered half a rack and he didn't want to finish them. They had a good bit of fat under the bark. The flavor was not disgusting or anything, but far from my favorite ribs. \\n\\nBoth of the plates come with toast and one little cup of BBQ sauce that you choose from a selection of 4. Carolina, an original vinegar base, sweet \\"Georgia\\" style (ketchup base), and a mayo based white sauce. I liked the Carolina best. I tried all four. The vinegar original and the Georgia ketchup base both tasted very similar to us.\\n\\nWe also ordered some smoked wings. We got ten and halved them. I will rate these average on my list of smoked wings. I have definitely had better, but also have had worse. The sauce, HOT, was spot on. Not too hot to where you cannot enjoy the wings, but hot enough to know it was there. I might stop in here again for a lunch sandwich, but probably not for supper. I will give it some time, and revisit for the supper/dinner time to see if it might have been a fluke night and they were still adjusting to being open.

Always a good choice.  Um, where was I? \\n\\nOh yeah.  I ordered the Vegetarian Pytt I Panna, which was a hash containing potatoes, a variety of veggies, and baked eggs on top.  The baked eggs were totally the best part, and any bite containing egg, potatoes, and pickled beets was a winner.  The dish was warm and comforting, but a little light on flavor.  I wanted to douse that mofo in a lake of ketchup, but I refrained for the sake of authenticity.  I feel like the mushrooms could have been left out, as the consistency was chewier than the rest of the dish and the Pytt I Panna could have benefited from more salt and less mushroom-ness (uhh, worst word choice ever).  Nonetheless, the dish was still savory, creative, and a perfect accompaniment to those ball-shaped Danish pancakes.\\n\\nMy companion had the apple fritter thing topped with baked eggs, it looked amazing! I'm pretty sure he totally loved it, but I was kind of busy creating perfect bites of egg and pickled beet to try it myself.  \\n\\nTo drink, we both ordered jasmine lavender tea, which came in a really awesome diffuser and tasted, seriously, soooooo good.

She finally brought some over and asked us if we would like drinks. We, of course got 2 margaritas being a Mexican restaurant. To start  we ordered guacamole, tostadas and soft tacos for the main. The girl brought a bowl of chips and some salsas. The chips were stale and looked like they were from a bag. They were not even warm. The salsas were ok. but just liquid not chunky at all. We were served our Margaritas and they were disgusting among the worst I have had. I had a few sips and made my hubby drink it because I could not. He drank it but agreed it was bad.  We had about 4 chips left in the bowl and a woman who brought the guacamole says \\"oh I see you already have chips if I knew I would not have brought these\\" but leaves them instead. Thank god because we were not going to eat the guacamole with our fingers.The guacamole was good but the portion was very small. Next were the Tostadas which were very good. and a good value, the best of the evening by a mile. They were fresh tasting and delicious. The soft tacos were just ok. The chicken was very dry and the shrimp were very scarce. The price is right but I would rather have decent portions at a higher price. The horrible Margaritas though were $9.00 each. More than our entrees. Had I known that I would have passed on those. I thought it was a good choice being a Mexican restaurant but I was wrong. I know of other restaurants that have way better Mexican food at just as reasonable prices. The service was very slow and it took 10 minutes to get a water after asking 2 people.

The hot dog was excellent, and i was impressed how they got a little cheese in and wrapped it up tight with the bacon, which was cooked perfectly. I wasn't totally sure how I felt about slaw on a dog but it was perfect! Large strips of cabbage with not too much mayo provided just enough crunch.

Unfortunately, while this was was one juicy, thick, and tasty Mary, it was just too hot for me. Holy horseradish Batman!! I'd been drinking margs all evening so maybe that was it...but I couldn't handle it. Props to the waitress for giving me something else instead - I had the Plantation (Hendrick's Gin, fresh basil, fresh-squeezed lime, grapefruit juice) which I really enjoyed. \\n\\nI topped off my meal with a chocolate chip bacon cookie - at $1.00 for two squares, I couldn't resist. It was good, but a little dry (I like my cookies moist and chewy). \\n\\nSo Frank is definitely unique. If you like dogs and you like bacon, its heaven. It's a fun atmosphere, and service was great. The only reason I'm reserving a star is because it's kinda expensive. (ok, the cookie aside) We had a $20 Groupon, but still dropped a ten spot.

We ordered a salad (house I believe?) some garlic rolls, and two large pizzas: one pepperoni and one margarita. \\n\\nThe garlic rolls were warm and had enough garlic flavor so it wasn't overpowering. I don't normally eat salads, but I was so hungry and this salad was so fresh and tasteful, I had to dig in. I'm glad it wasn't a huge portion of rolls or salad because that meant there was still space in my stomach for the pizza. \\n\\nI'm a pepperoni lover, so having my first bite of the pizza was literally an out of body experience. Not greasy, not too much of any condiment -- basically, it was perfected. Because I love pepperoni so much, I had obviously never tried anything like the margarita pizza. The pizza sits well on your stomach, it's not heavy and what I like most about the margarita is that you can see AND taste the freshness of the condiments. Though I love pepperoni, the margarita's bits of tomatoes took my heart away. \\n\\nI have only been here once, but SoCo, Austin, and Homeslice have a special place in my heart."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Out of this world!!

But upon arriving, realized that although its spring on the calender, the weather hasn't gotten the memo yet.  So I asked to be sat inside.  Maybe the hostess didn't  realize that we were wanted to participate in the patio party,  but she never mentioned to be by being sat in the dining room I would not be able to order from special pricing menu that was being offered for those that were attending the patio event.\\n\\nI asked Kia, our server for a Pimm Cup, which was being promoted on the restaurant Facebook page as one of the drinks for the patio party and she had no idea what I was talking about.  She did explain that the dining room area was not a part of the patio event, and I would not be able to get the crawfish or pimm cup if I choose to continue sitting in the dining room.  I inquired what other foods were available and she showed up with a menu for the patio party.  After viewing it we, decided to stay in the dining room, but I did request something from the party menu called Hunch Punch, she came back about 3 minutes later with 2 Pimm Cups and stated they were out of the Hunch Punch, and that she would only be able to give me the two Pimm Cups because those drinks were not being offered in the dining room, but since I had asked three times for that drink in particular, she wanted me to have them. \\n\\nWe began ordering from the menu, that I was told is changed daily, we started out with a dozen oysters *very small but the mignonette was great , 2 orders of the eat and peel shrimp and an order of fried oysters with a type of beef confit.    I could have eaten these three things and been a happy girl, but since this was our first time here, we ordered entrees also.  My mother, went with the pork chops, these were tender, but didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  Who knows, maybe I'm just use to deep fried  or grilled pork chops, but the wood hearth roasted pork chops were not infused with flavor, but my mother enjoyed them and if you've read my previous posts, you know she can be hard to please and swear that everything taste too salty.   She also got a side order of beets.  Which I have never like, but these beets.  I would eat them. Something about the pistachos gave it a better flavor than when I've tried them in the past. \\n\\nMy daughter went with the Vermillion Snapper.  Kia, made sure to tell her that it was only the fish and she didn't want us to be surprised when she came back with the plate and it was only the fish, so she ordered the fingerling potatoes.  Personally for $25, I thought it would have been an entire fish, but it was a 6oz filet.  She ate every bit of it. \\n\\n I order the fish and chips, which came with crispy potatoes and an aioli. The piece of cod was tasty and three times the size of my daughters fish and $4 cheaper.  The potatoes were average at best.  I also order some hushpuppies and were shock when they arrived with powdered sugar on top. I didn't  pay attention on the menu that the were offered \\"beignet style\\".   It didn't help them taste any better, but gave them a sweet taste, which didn't interact very well with the  malt vinegar I had poured over my fish. \\n\\nOverall, the environment is friendly and service is laid back and friendly.

We came in for the lunch buffet both times and I was absolutely floored by the quality and freshness of everything on display. It is normally against my policy to not review a place until i've been there at least 4-5 times, but since this place was out of town (and i've thought about it a few times since coming home) i thought i might as well get this out of me before i start waking up in the middle of the night screaming for more masala and vindaloo...\\n\\nAs i said, we were here for the buffet, and though the selection isn't terribly large, there is something to satisfy vegetarian and carnivore appetites alike. The lentil soup is perfectly spiced, great for dipping the very fresh tasting pitas conveniently cut into wedges. The rice made a great bed for any of the other well-spiced cuisines which change at the buffet (or, well they had changed in the space of a week between the first and second visit here). Highlights were an unexpected beef stew with curry and cilantro, a chickpea salad with several cooling aspects and several warming aspects, and the iced tea, which is brewed with cardamom, cloves, cinnamon bark, bay leaves, and fresh ginger.

The high ratings and glowing reviews deceived me into thinking I was going to get a hearty home cooked comforting Southern meal. What I received was much less than satisfactory. So let me start by saying that I had no problems with the 30-45 min wait on a Sunday afternoon. I figured it would be packed after all the good people left church so I expected at least an hour wait. I walked over to the vintage store next door and by the time I returned from buying a couple of things it was time to be seated. Once seated, it was about 20 mins before our server finally came over and when he did he spoke quickly and barely took the time to listen to our questions or requests. He was not very friendly, it seemed like he was trying to get us in and out as quickly as possible. Of course I understand that it's a busy place but geez I don't want to feel rushed when eating Sunday dinner. Now about the food....I enjoyed the fact that there was a bread basket to hold you over before you meal and I will admit that I ate almost the whole thing minutes after it was left on the table. The cinnamon rolls were delicious but they could have used some icing in my humble opinion. I also tried the pot likker which was a bit strange and not something I had ever had or even heard about before, I have to say it wasn't for me. On to the entrees...I ordered the shrimp and grits which were meh. The shrimp were scantily seasoned and the cheese grits were thick and dry. I had the greens w/cornbread and the sweet souffl√© as my sides. The greens were lackluster and made me sad because they are one of my favorite soul food sides (especially when paired with cornbread) and he souffl√© was decent. My boyfriend, a chicken connoisseur, ordered the fried chicken and reported that it was a no go. Overall I would not return or recommend this restaurant.

There are rarely 4-5 people in a space that once didn't have the seating for all the patrons waiting for their meals. Worst of all, the quality has decreased drastically. Food prep seems careless employees replace ingredients when they're missing something without informing you, changing the flavor or consistency of the item. In smoothie bowls, I've begun to notice they use non house made granola as a filler by pouring a heaping handful on top and skimping on other toppings.\\nIt's always a bummer when profit becomes more important than the product.

I went to the restaurant around 9:30pm. They do have a valet in the parking garage to the immediate left of the restaurant. Valet was extremely slow when I went and the line got long quickly. It was $20, which is high because most restaurants usually have much lower valet fees, even in that area, so maybe they have a different deal with that parking garage or company. \\n\\nThe restaurant was really packed so you know its the newest spot. It was gorgeous inside and has a nice feel but it was quite loud. Everyone looked pretty nice so they were what I call casual cute attire all the way to dressy attire. I recommend making reservations at least a day in advance. I made mine the day of, so my reservation was not until 11pm. The hostesses were nice and checked people in quickly and she directed me to the two bars. One on the main level and another on the rooftop. I opted for the rooftop. \\n\\nNote: There was a live drummer and saxophonist. The DJ was already spinning and they actually play with the DJ. Nice touch! A++\\n\\nRooftop is spacious (furniture is a little unnatractive. Those lime green cushions just didn't go with the beauty of the rest of the place.) I ordered a Texas Margarita with Patron and it was well made. No fresh ingredients but still it was good. The price was $12.96. I hung out up there for a while and met great people. The rooftop has heated lamps. I noticed hookah was available. \\n\\nAround 11 we went to claim our table. Important Notes: the drummer and saxophonist were still playing with the DJ and sounded great. The DJ switched out about this time as well because now the restaurant switches from restaurant to a condensed menu. They also start charging at this time because its def more of a lounge feel. Also not sure if there was a designated dance floor but people were dancing at their tables and having a great time. \\n\\nI ordered wings and Mac & Cheese. My friends got sliders and fries. The wings were cooked well but overall the food was just okay. Mac and Cheese had that fake cheese flavor. It was all priced high and I'm sure they have a high overhead at this location so that's cool. Plus the ambience. It's a great spot. My thing is this...don't sell Dugan's food and over charge for it. Sell amazing food and charge amazing food prices. I just don't like conflicting restaurants. They need to step up the menu so the place isn't a dive bar pretending to be a nice restaurant/ lounge. \\n\\nAlso, the server kept messing everyone's orders up. Our table and other tables. From my experience in that industry they need to be writing orders down by table number and table seat. Yea it was loud but write it down..repeat the order back to confirm. Boom! Done! Also, there seemed to be only one register for them to place orders at...they are in need of another. Our server was very nice and level headed so that made it all easier to deal with. \\n\\nAll in all...its a nice place. Great for ladies night, dinner parties, celebrations, good music, good vibes. Okay date spot but not for a first date! So I would have given this place 3 stars because the valet issues, food, and drinks could be made with more quality but I'm giving 4 because the staff was nice and the vibes were awesome!

If you order a meal and there is a problem expect to wait up to 1/2 an hour while the comedy of errors plays out with the staff as they have no training for dealing with anything out of the ordinary.\\n\\nMy wife and I went there for the first time on a Saturday morning, the cafe was not busy.  I ordered the oatmeal and my wife the Bica Breakfast.\\n\\nWe waited for about 10 minutes as people came and went and placed orders.  As it turns out, I was facing the barrista and noticed that 2 french press coffees went out;  so we went and asked for our french press since we were still waiting on breakfast.  Mistake 1, turns out they had given out all their french presses, so they offered to make us a latte.\\n\\n5 minutes later we still did not have our food and at least 4 other orders had gone out.  Finally they brought out my wife's Bica breakfast but did not have my oatmeal.  When the server started to leave, I pointed this out that there was an oatmeal on the order -- he looked surprised, mistake 2.\\n\\nWhen my wife opened her egg it was hard boiled, mistake 3.  I took this back to the register and pointed out that the egg was supposed to be soft boiled, he took the egg back and I returned to the table.\\n\\nAt this point my wife had still not received her latte, which was in response to them not allocating a french press to her when we made our order.  The response of the barrista was that it was coming up, mistake 4.  At this point, I realized that they had absolutely no processes in place to handle orders that had mistakes or got misplaced.\\n\\nWe finally got the latte.  It was now about 25 minutes and we were waiting for the egg.  Then I see 2 orders of eggs heading out the door, and realize that we should have gotten one of those eggs.  I headed to the register and saw that 2 more orders were getting prepared to head out to other people.  Somehow our egg order had gotten lost or pushed to the back of the queue, mistake 5.\\n\\nI won't bore you with the rest of this sordid story -- I eventually got my money back, but it is clear that each of the staff members at this place know their job but there is no one trained or able to help you when they make a mistake."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great fun Portland hot spot.

My girlfriend took me here for my birthday as she knows how much I love pizza.  And after all the great reviews we figured why now, and they look to have a great wine selection too.  We got there and wow thankfully we had reservations as the place was packed.  \\nWe got seated and our server immediately came over to offer us water, this was a good start to things.  After that he became very slow and un-attentive.  He took our order for a couple of glasses of wine, and our appetizers (We decided on the Stagionale, Frutti di Mare and Arancino).  The appetizers came very promptly and while enjoying them he came back to take our order for the main course, we thought this was great... until the pizzas came about 5 minutes later and we had to move around all the plates on the table to accommodate the pizzas that came much to quickly.\\nWe wanted to order some more wine for the main course, and we were looking at bottles.  When the waiter came over he almost had an attitude of why would we of all people be looking at bottles of wine and should just stick to glasses as we prob cant afford them even... On a side note we are pretty well traveled, and have been to Napa so we know a thing or two about wine.\\nAfter the waiter finally took our order for the wine we had the pizza.  We got a Margherita and a Maiale pizza, they honestly were pretty mediocre.  While they tasted pretty fresh it was just nothing to rave about and the crust was a bit soggy, should have been cooked just a bit longer.  When we were finished we had to flag down the waiter as he seemed to have forgotten about us as we sat there empty glassed and clearly waiting for out check.\\n\\nTL;DR - Overall the service was poor, and the pizzas were not as good as everyone makes them out to be.  Honestly reheating the left over pizza in our oven the next day on a pizza stone made them 10x better than they were fresh."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Visited awhile back with my friend.

In other words, no carbs from foods such as pasta or bread.  At the very least, this is next to impossible to avoid in an Italian restaurant.  Nevertheless, after being invited to participate in a new dating premise presented to me in the most unlikely of scenarios, I quickly agreed to partake in the event.  Especially, since it would provide me with an excuse and opportunity to check out Prickly Pear's sister restaurant.  \\n\\nLacking cash upon arrival to pay for the Valet service out front, I had to instead park at the Lofts garage a couple of blocks down in Thornton Park and shiver my way (it was cold) to the restaurant on Eola.  \\n\\nThe ambiance is definitely not what one would expect from an Italian restaurant.  No loud colors, no stereotypical Italian (or insert your favorite 'rat pack' member here) music blaring on speakers strategically positioned to drown out the sound of your body getting fatter.  Instead, you get a toned down, trendy and modern look that is dimly lit and romantic.  It definitely sets the tone for a relaxing dinner.  The tables are arranged at a good distance from each other, preventing the restaurant from becoming too crowded and too loud.  The space is wisely used.\\n\\nSince this was an 'event', the courses were predetermined.  I started off with a delicious breaded goat cheese appetizer that was accompanied by a small salad with diced fruits on top and some nicely set up bread in the middle.  I skipped the bread due to my diet and instead focused on the fruity salad (no pun intended) along with eating only half of the goat cheese.  Now you may say 'Only half of such a deliciously breaded cheese David?', yes I know, it's sacrilege, but when trying to avoid a flatulence filled evening one must be fairly strategic in their food consumption early on.  I'm always thinking ahead, lest my judgment become clouded.  See what I did there?\\n\\nI picked the Chicken Marsala with mushrooms and potatoes as the main dish (see my photo).  The chicken was good, nothing very special to it.  Something that was quickly pointed out to me and subsequently noticed by my palate as well was the higher than usual saltiness.  The salt content overshadowed the rest of the flavors in the entree leaving something to be desired.\\n\\nBeing a true health nut and wanting to make sure I did not need to move my belt back one notch for the rest of the night, I skipped dessert.  It looked really good, but I did not try any of it.  However, based on looks alone I would recommend their cheesecake.  If only my eyes could taste...\\n\\nOverall, this is a decent place.  I will have to return at some not too distant future for further evaluation.  In the meantime, I recommend it for those wanting to do something different at a nice area in Downtown Orlando.\\n\\nCiao!"},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I loved my breakfast (French toast with bananas and carmel) at the Paramount. \\n\\nThe place is small and the lines can be long, but it is well worth the wait."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Called to find out more about the function room.

It is really nothing too special, it seems with the menu it is a smaller version of Gator's Dockside. There is no real special focus on the menu, but there is seemingly a wide variety(from roasted blue cheese jalape√±os to gyros to jumbo). I understand that this is a relatively new restaurant and items will be thrown out and replaced but they are missing out on that signature item(s) that people want to go to a certain restaurant for. One neat concept that they had, which I think was a head in the right direction, was a grilled watermelon salad, a unique item that I kinda want to try. \\n\\nTheir slogan is \\"where FRESH meets FUNKY\\" which does describe the atmosphere at all. The only thing funky as previously stated is their awkward selection of food and possibly the thought behind it might be \\"that if America is a melting pot of culture, maybe we should have that reflect in our menu and have a smorgasbord of items on there.\\" If that is true then they hit the nail on the head. The variety however might be a good thing that has that item for all the members of your friends/family.\\n\\nOverall I would probably want to go back in a couple of months during football season to give it a second chance.

Tucked away in the eclectic Coolidge Corner arcade, I was impressed by the friendly and attentive staff, limited (but good enough) beer selection, and finally, the ramen itself. Flavorful, generous in size, and fresh- I guess that's all I went in hoping for. Delicious as it was, I opted for no egg, and received a tasty but small, portion of pork so $14 seemed steep for what it was. I read about their ingredients and method of cooking on their website and appreciate the style, and perhaps that's a normal price point for ramen. I am far from an expert. Will I come often? No. But would I recommend this place to a ramen-lover? Sure. It was a pleasant experience and feels like a place that cares about the craft as well as the final product.

Home Slice is authentic, yet original. They are cool, but inclusive. They are fun, but serious about what they do. The staff is cohesive, yet all have their own distinct character.\\n\\nAnd the pizza? The pizza is so far superior to any other pizza in Austin, TX that it's almost embarrassing. I can't figure out why, but it still falls just short of getting pizza in New York. Is it the water? I dunno. So close, and still so darn good. The salads kick ass. House wines? Kick ass. Service? Kicks ass. \\n\\nI am in awe of the simple wisdom Alexandra L. has shared in her review. Every time I go to H'slice, I over eat and over spend. The idea of just getting a slice and sharing HALF of a salad is revolutionary. It's now possible to enjoy the taste and ambiance without getting too fat or too broke. \\n\\nJenni and I always get a Large pie with Kalamata olives (we take a few slices home for later! Home slices, if you will.). We'll start with a Pear Gorgonzola salad, and I substitute spinach for the greens. It's a little heartier and healthier, too. \\n\\nI grew up 45 minutes North of New York City. A Pizza Hut tried to open in our little town, and couldn't survive. The town is largely Italian-American, and had no need or interest for chain pizza. There is a small, privately owned pizzeria every  mile. The worst of any of these places is, quite frankly, better than anything I've had anywhere else. I had a margherita pizza in Naples, Italy that was great, but that's a different thing altogether.\\n\\nI stand in awe of the BBQ and Mex here in town, but I've had some serious NY pizza in my day.

About 10 of us went on Saturday about the time they opened.  It was only the second day the Biergarten was open so it was new for all of us.  The seating area is large communal picnic tables which were great since we all got to sit together, and then as some of us left earlier than others, we had new people join us which made for an entertaining and friendly day of beer, bratwurst, and meeting new people.  The Biergarten has horseshoes, corn hole boards, and some dart boards.  Everything is paid for with $5 tokens you purchase when you walk in or as needed so there is never a wait for a waiter/waitress.  Just use your tokens at the food truck or the bar.  At first things seemed pretty expensive until you really think about the fact that the price you pay with the tokens includes both tip and tax.  Once factoring in built in tax and tip in the price, it really isn't much more expensive than other German places in the city.  Maybe a little bit, but not much.  I hope people think about that when they look at the price of beers and food.  The food was excellent.  Among our group, we probably got pretty much one of everything on the menu, and everyone commented on how great it was.  I personally had the curry wurst which was delicious.  I can't comment on the beer selection since apparently Friday night, opening night, they were cleaned out of most of their beers and had to scramble Saturday morning for more.  I ended up drinking several litres of non-German beer, but it was a great micro-brew not water like Bud/Miller.  I was told they would have more German beers on draft again quickly.

My first experience here was actually quite pleasant. I was here for an anniversary dinner, was seated right next to the window, and had a very friendly waiter. The ambience is romantic, and the view is beautiful. \\n\\nBut my second experience here practically killed any positive feelings I have about this place. I came here with a large group of friends from school around 3pm. We were planning on getting drinks and desserts / appetizers as a small pre-dinner treat. The hostess absolutely REFUSED to seat us in the main dining area although there were plenty of empty seats (it was 3pm for gods sake) because those seats were already \\"reserved for dinner\\" (which wasn't going to happen for another 2-3 hours). She told us to go order and sit at the bar. Fine. But the problem? There weren't enough open seats at the bar to accommodate all of us, so a couple of us ordered and sat on the couches in the lounge area. Right then, a waitress came over and told us that food and drinks are not allowed in the lounge, which was exclusively a waiting area. So we got kicked out with drinks and food in our hands. No one bothered to tell us where to go or even offered to hold our drinks and food for us as we awkwardly maneuvered around the restaurants with full hands. Frustrated, we decided to go to a standing area between the bar and main dining area to quickly finish our drinks and food, then pay and go. We placed our food down on a ledge and was starting to let our frustration sink when another waitress came over and told us that we can't stand there because it's a fire hazard. EXCUSE ME, but if we can't sit down in the dining area, can't eat in the waiting area, or can't stand in the middle of the restaurant, where exactly are we supposed to go?! The bathroom? Probably not, because there's probably another rule against that too.

When we first walked in, I was a bit concerned that this would be yet another restaurant to put aesthetics so high above acoustics on their priority list that diners can't hear the people at their own tables. It's in a huge warehouse with loading bay doors. The ceiling is very high. There's metal everywhere. And yet, when I sat down across the table from J, I didn't have to shout to be heard. The decor is great--the red fabric lamps reflect the red flower portraiture on the walls, and it's all a nice soft contrast from the industrial metal of the room. The kitchen is open, but they took it to the next level by making the walls a see-through Plexiglas, so you can see everything they're doing in there, and even where they store the pans. \\n\\nOur server was friendly, snarky, upbeat and helpful, making great suggestions and never letting us go drinkless. It's how all the hipster restaurants should do it, if you ask me. Why be rude when you can be a smart-ass in a nice way?

I remarked when I first read the menu that the place was like a weird Southern-Asian fusion restaurant, and what the hell was that all about, and we smirked, and then we took our first bite of that friggin' slaw. The cole slaw that tops the fried green tomatoes (which were plump and moist and great) is half-Southern traditional, half-crispy Asian noodle, and it is amazing. Then, for dinner, I ordered the brisket, which is marinated in brown sugar for 12 hours and then cooked to perfection. It flaked apart with my fork, and it was wonderful. The mac and cheese that went with it was too creamy, almost a soup, and this was the one downside to the whole experience. I love mac and cheese, and that was just kind of gross.

They offered to make her an oat and veggie risotto which was really good, like a savory oatmeal. The servers were very accommodating to my 3 year old nephew, who really enjoyed his grilled fish and cucumbers, but especially loved the candy cap ice cream which (shockingly, to me anyway) is made out of candy cap mushrooms. My brother-in-law and I shared a peach cobbler with crackly bacon and caramel, and while it was interesting, it wasn't my favorite bacon-based dessert I'd ever had.

The Paramount, after having been very highly praised and recommended by some trustworthy readers and contributors to the blog, was a let-down, but more than that, really left us wanting more. I'm not discounting people's opinions, I swear I get no joy or pleasure out of disliking a burger (although it's sometimes easier to write with a slightly negative vibe than not) but this one was never in the cards for me. It wasn't all mediocre, the bun was nice and fresh, a good fit for the massive burger on the plate. But bigger does not always equal better, as the grilled burger had very little flavor and came out on the medium-well end of the burger spectrum. I was never asked how I wanted my burger cooked, not a big issue if it's flavorful and juicy, but this was not juicy and was minimal on the flavor. Un-melted cheese, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions and house-made pickles all topped the patty, all with mixed results. I don't need to divulge any further on the topic of un-melted cheese, so I wont bore you with another rant on that topic. The mushrooms and onions were fine, not exactly an unusual topping, but at least something extra was attempted for what is usually a very basic and boring house burger around these city parts. Fries are best when they are simply prepared and executed to salty, golden perfection. The fries at Paramount are simple, yes, but are not so golden and are not so salty. Not a complete failure, but nothing noteworthy either.\\n\\nFor $11 I can't complain about the price, especially for the size, which as mentioned is quite massive. On a different day, maybe I find The Paramount to be charming and intimate, and if you're a regular, I bet that's exactly how you feel nine times out of ten. But for me, on my one and probably only visit, I found it to be unwelcoming, unsatisfying, and an overall disappointment."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It met my expectations.

The wait was completely bearable, but the people shoving past you to get to the blocked bathrooms, or the workers with dirty dishes trying to get to the blocked kitchen, was honestly pretty hectic and annoying.\\n\\nI definitely am giving this place the stars it is getting because I admire the kitchen team so much. They were constantly taking orders and making the food quickly, right in front of you. They were extremely friendly and helpful.

We immediately received our food, and were seated by a hostess. If you are worried about being seated after you order, don't be.

There was definitely nothing wrong with the food, and it tasted good, but honestly it wasn't anything at all special. My friend and I got breakfast sandwiches on bagels, and split an order of the Boston cream pancakes. Again, all food was fine, it just felt like I could've gotten it anywhere else, or even made it myself. This wouldn't have bothered me if I hadn't had to wait in the massive chaotic line for over 20 minutes!\\n\\nOverall, the food was good enough and the service was great, but I wouldn't bother waiting in line thinking you're going to have some crazy good food that makes the wait worth it.

The food variety is decent and they have daily specials. The menu is just too generic and not particularly Texan in any way like you might expect from a restaurant located inside a Texas history museum, so maybe that's why I wasn't too enthused.

Now it's a Purveyor of Artisan Sausage. Insert your own wiener joke here. They also have a really extensive, creative drink menu. Now, back in the day, I dated a salesperson who sold things that people who worked in discos really wanted, so I had never bought a drink in this building before. I had a Junipero and Tonic, which our waitress said was the ultimate gin and tonic. It was very tasty and I almost wished for a hot, summer Texas day to enjoy it. I love it! Sweetie liked his Dark and Stormy, too.Then on to the hot dogs. Unfortunately, they were out of the weekly vegetarian sausage, which was some kind of Mexican thing wrapped in a tortilla, so the waitress said to try the Sonoran Dog with a vegan hot dog. The Sonoran Dog is a 100% Vienna Beef, stuffed with cheese, wrapped in bacon and deep fried, dressed with caramelized onions, diced onions, diced tomato, pinto beans, jalapeno sauce, mayonaise, mustard, so I asked her if she was going to stuff the vegan dog with cheese, wrap it in bacon, and deep fry it? She assured me it she would keep it vegan. It was great! A little messy, but they have forks. Just the right spiciness and the vegan dog was pretty good. Sweetie enjoyed his Duck a l'orange Dog as well. The real winner for the night was my corn cup.

I no longer see Ramen as just salt and noodles, but as something much heartier, which is great to warm you up, especially on a cold day. Decided to go here on a whim, and a very strange only half-present craving for ramen.\\n\\nThe decor here is interesting... It is a modern space, and is very brightly lit, but some aspects of the aesthetic experience don't seem like they fit together. \\n\\nDo be advised there is a possibility that you may be sitting at a communal table.¬† This becomes especially likely if you come by yourself.¬†\\n\\nI decided to order:\\n\\n- Aji Tama (marinated soft-boiled egg)\\n- Toroniku Pao Zi (think Bao/pork bun)\\n- Tonkotsu Shio Ramen\\n\\nThe marinated soft-boiled egg was a very interesting experience. I never even knew you could marinate an egg! I did like how it was cooked, with the egg white being ever so delicately soft while retaining its firmness. The yolk meanwhile was warm and delightfully gooey. As for the marinade: while I did notice I hint of it, I would have liked it to be a little more pronounced.\\n\\nThe pork bun was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. The pork was very soft and tender, some of the tenderest pork I've ever had. Although the flavor is quite mild, it's very flavorful nonetheless.¬† the sauce they use is awesome! It's a great blend of tiny and sweet. I do have to critiques in regards to this though: first, I would have liked just a tiny bit more veggies. Second, the bun itself was a little dense for my taste, but not too much more than I had in other places.\\n\\nAnd then there's the ramen...\\n\\nWhen they say this is Silky Smooth, they are not exaggerating.¬† I¬† was also pleasantly surprised that the level of oil and salt was on point. It contains the same wonderfully tender pork the pork buns did (at least I think so).¬†this consistency carried over to the veggies and noodles in the ramen. Everything when together really nicely in both intensity of flavor and consistency.\\n\\nWhat I found really amazing is that I actually like the touch of the scallions. Scallions are on my list of least favorite foods, but this made me look at them a different way.¬†\\n\\nProportion-wise: While the proportion of noodles to broth was great, I would have liked a little bit more veggies, and two-and-a-half little bits more meat.¬†¬†\\n\\nAlso, what's up with that red thing that looks like a cherry or a tomato or what have you? I bit into it and was immediately met with something hard, astringent, and bitter, something which is only half edible. Yikes!¬† I think this may be only decorative, just like that pink swirly radish, only the radish is perfectly edible.\\n\\nA few other notes I have:\\n\\nWhile the price for what I got was very fair and a great value, I have the following gripe:¬† you can get a smaller portion of ramen for $1 less, or a larger portion for $1 more. Based on what I've seen and heard a dollar seems to offset the balance of value. You can allegedly get a much bigger bowl or a much smaller bowl. This gets weird when you consider that the difference in price between a small bowl and a quite large bowl is two bucks.\\n\\nAlso, they have these little baskets for putting your purse or backpack into and keeping them off the ground. This is certainly a nice touch for those who don't want to put these sometimes very nice items on the ground.¬†\\n\\nThe service was quick!\\n\\nI look forward to returning any trying some of their bolder options!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm extremely compelled to write a review about Voodoo Doughnuts because of the huge rave surrounding this place.

Seriously. This place is amazing. \\n\\nWe were able to get a 10pm dinner reservation. 10pm. We were tired. We weren't even really that hungry because ever since we got into Portland we have been constantly stuffing our face with delicious food. We were resting all nice and warm at the hotel when my husband said \\"It's 9:30, we should get going to dinner.\\" We walked there in the cold, and it was kind of sprinkling outside. You could tell we were tired, not even that hungry, for a late dinner. Not excited that much, not expecting anything to blow our minds. \\n\\n\\"Where is this place?\\" As we walked around a warehouse looking area. Once we arrived to Adina, wow, did our moods change a bit.\\n\\nWe were right on time, and they quickly got a booth ready for us, in the corner of the restaurant. It was such a nice booth. The ambiance was really warm and inviting. \\n\\nThey have so many options on their menu, but we quickly decided to do a tapas style dinner so we can try and share more food. Also, a random note, I was surprised at the number of dishes that had quinoa. I've never been to a restaurant that served quinoa, especially in the way they cook it up. The tapas come in 3 sizes: Small $10, Medium $19, and Large $36. So I'll be letting you know what size we got to give you an idea of how much you get for that size. Also, don't be afraid to ask your waiter to help you with this, you don't want to order too little or too much of something, especially when you want to try a lot of things.\\n\\nWhat we got:\\n\\nComplimentary bread with 3 types of dipping sauce: Sauces were hot (chili verde) , med (passionfruit) , mild (some kind of peanut sauce). My favorite was the chili verde and passion fruit. That chili verde would taste amazing on a burrito for sure. Definitely interesting choices for bread dip.\\n\\nChicaronnes de Langostinos (small): Came with 6 shrimps and a kind of tamarind dipping sauce. Clever way of using quinoa in the batter. Nice and crispy, and the sauce was also very good.\\n\\nConchas a la Parilla (med): came with 2 separate scallops in their own mini dishes. These scallops were cooked very well. The crispy onions on top were a nice touch to give it a contrasting texture, and the sauce that came with the scallops really let the natural scallop flavor shine.\\n\\nPalta Rellena de Cangrejo (med): came with 2 half avocados filled with crab meat and shrimp on top. This was really refreshing. It very generous with the half of an avocado and the shrimp and crab salad paired well with it. There was also a little bit of spicy sauce on the plate which added a nice kick.\\n\\nAnticucho de pulpo (med): came with 2 skewers of grilled octopus tentacles. These were cooked nicely. The tentacles must have been massaged or something because they were not chewy and had a nice bite to it. \\n\\nCeviche - De Pescado \\"5 Elementos\\", Mango Verde Y Langostinos, and Mixto Chorrillano: According to my husband, the ceviche monster, everything was very fresh and delicious. His favorite out of the three, though, had to be the Mango Verde Y Langostinos. His least favorite was the Mixto Chorrillano, which he said was still good, but not as special as the others. That one tasted like regular ceviche to him.\\n\\nOysters: There were a couple different types, and because I couldn't have any raw stuff since I was preggers at the time, my husband told me the smallest of the oysters were his favorite. And the 3 toppings for the oysters were good too. Very unique toppings from what I could remember.\\n\\nPlato de Crema Quemada: 3 different times of Creme Brulee based on peruvian flavors. These were a little thicker than the creme brulee I'm used to, but still was good. But might order something else next time. I think it didn't have that WOW factor like a lot of other dishes I had throughout the night.\\n\\nHelado de Lucuma con Higos: It was like this big scoop of ice cream coated with crunchy nuts or something. It was also good, but again, was missing the Wow factor for me.\\n\\nAcaipirihana: Our friend said he would have liked to have tasted more Acai in this drink, my husband loved it because he loves sour stuff. \\n\\nService was attentive, but never annoying. Our food came out surprisingly quickly and everything was delicious. Any server that came to our table were knowledgeable about the food they served, and had humble demeanor. In the end, the bill wasn't bad for 3 people for the amount of food we had, might be a tad on the more expensive side, but everything was on point, and you gotta stop and have a nice dinner once in a while. YOLO.\\n\\nDefinitely would hit this spot again if I were ever to come back to Portland.\\n\\nMind, blown."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is pretty cool, but it's basically like visiting the Space Needle (except you get a yummy doughnut from it). When you go (we both know you will), be prepared to stand in a pretty long line. For this reason, I'd recommend visiting in the Summer when it's warmer. As you wait in line, you can peruse the menu on Yelp. You'll want to do this, as you otherwise won't know the difference between a Miami Vice Berry and a Grape Ape. I also wish that everyone else would Yelp the menu, because it sure would help it move quicker! You also want to make sure that you have cash; it's all that they take. No worries if you don't have any, since they have an ATM in the store. Just good to know so that you can go get cash while someone holds your place in line. Don't be that guy and wait until it's time to pay. Keep it moving folks.\\n\\nBack to the original statement, though, this is pretty much just a touristy thing to do. I can't imagine going on a regular basis. The line is way too long, and the doughnuts aren't \\"to die for\\" or anything. They're definitely cute, inventive, and taste good; price is pretty cheap as well. It's just not worth standing in line forever for. But if you're only in Portland once every six months, or if you have a Voodoo virgin in tow, then definitely go! The worst that can happen is you walk away with a maple bar with a strip of bacon on top. And that's not bad at all."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious apps - the main entrees are nothing special but still very well done.

The restaurant decor is lacking, but to me that just means no-frills, authentic food to me. To rate a pho restaurant, you have to get the pho. The service was speedy, and the pho was delicous. I ordered the large and couldn't finish. They give you so much noodles and a LOT of beef. It was so savory. Even though I just moved here, I've been to pho 99 at least once or twice a week (and this is after I told myself I'm cutting down on eating out) and it's good every time. I don't know what they put in their soup (I'm betting lots of MSG) but it is sooo good. The only small complaint I had was the noodles were just slightly overcooked- not as chewy as I like them to be. The prices are the same as all the other pho restaurants (7 something for a large pho). Other people are complaining about it being expensive, which I don't see. They do offer an XL bowl for 8. Usually I just get the biggest size, so I ordered the XL the first time- WAY too much, I think I got through half of it. So order the large and the prices will be more than reasonable. There are a lot of pho restaurants in the vicinity, and pho 99 is by far the best."},{"name":"Ask For Luigi","address":"305 Alexander Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Worth the wait!

Brisket was above average for sure, but I ate some without sauce and my first thought was, this needs some sauce.  Just didn't have a lot of flavor.  Pork Tenderloin was a bit on the chewy side and not that flavorful.  Honestly pork tenderloin (and pulled pork) are really easy to smoke and hard to mess up, so I got take off a point there.  I would go with 4 stars maybe, but in addition to running out of meats on the day I went they were out of pickles.  The meat I can understand but pickles come on.

Of course after we come back inside to get a rain check, a new cashier was there and laughed when we told him the situation and said, no we can't do that. So, yep.
