You can easily fill yourself up with just the bread but do what you can to resist.  Tonight I started with the antipasti which came with an assortment of meats, olives and mozzarella cheese.  Simple yet just the perfect thing to waken your taste buds.  It's not filling at all and the meats were really flavorful.  The assortment of olives was also lovely and a great accompaniment to the meats.  For my entr√©e, I ordered the rigatoni bolognese.  This was a very simple dish topped with slow cook meat sauce with Parmesan sprinkled over the top.  I love their sauce, it's really what makes this dish.  Everything is made with organic ingredients and you can tell, they put effort in making their sauces.  The folks that run this place are native Italians and after eating my meal here, it reminded me of my recent trip to Rome.  The flavor and care they put into their pasta was just like how I remembered my dinner next to the Pantheon.  If you're looking for a place that dishes authentic Italian dishes, Piazza Italia is the closest I can find to the quality of meats, cheeses, sauces and pasta that I had in Italy.  If you've never been here, I highly recommend coming.  You are seriously missing out if you don't. I highly recommend making reservations, especially if your party is 4 or greater.  The restaurant is small, and this place is popular so if you don't have reservations the wait can be close to an hour during peak hours. Okay enough reading.

That being said, I don't know how I've bypassed this temple of glorious gluttony multiple times without ever noticing it.\\n\\nFood: Nook offers typical pub fare, the vast of majority of which has made a pass through the kitchen's deep frier prior to embarking on the journey to your table. However, their claim to fame are the \\"Totchos\\", which are essentially a nacho platter with tater tots instead of nachos. In fact, their \\"Totchos\\" are apparently so famous that they have gone so far as to trademark the term.  During my first visit, we opted for the \\"Redneck Totchos\\" which were laced with cheese and barbeque pork - the dish was fairly solid, but it I was disappointed with the limited quantity of cheese and meat. For entrees, we order the \\"Peachtree\\" (chicken sandwich) and the \\"Shrimp and Grits Burger\\", the latter of which was labeled as \\"award winning\\" on the menu. I'm not necessarily sure who the judge was, but I don't really care because both entrees were excellent.\\n\\nService: Friendly, but inconsistent. Nook is one of those places where  different waiters will take your order, bring out the food, and remove your dishes, so it can be difficult to flag the appropriate person down if you're in need of assistance. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The Nook is your typical neighborhood tavern. It's located directly across the street from Piedmont Park, so the clientele is fairly eclectic and the place is typically packed. The also have a really nice patio that looks out onto the park entrance.\\n\\nPrice: Moderately pricey for pub fare, but I wouldn't expect anything different in that location. An order of \\"Totchos\\" will run you nearly $7, but most other sandwiches, salads, and burgers are in the $10 to $12 range. They do have a handful of larger entrees as well that cost around $20.\\n\\nOther: The indoor booths are more uncomfortable to sit in than a church pew. They also have angled mirrors along the wall over the booths, which just seemed odd - I'm not really a fan of being reminded of my unrelenting gluttony when I'm about to pound an order of \\"Totchos\\"."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"YESSSSSSSSS!!!!

Everyone was also super friendly so no complaints in that department.\\n\\nFood: the foooooooooooooood. I mean, come onnnnnn. It was TOO good. The island creek oysters - ohhh the oysters! By far, the best I have ever had. Delicious, big, perfectly shucked, and served with an assortment of sauces. Something for everyone. I ordered the salmon and the bf had the bouillabaisse... both were REALLY good. I particularly loved mine (although it wasn't the prettiest dish in the world) because it was healthy (I think) and fantastic. They cook the salmon fairly rare, which I decided I prefer.

Another call from the restaurant reconfirming again - plus another call from the driver.  An evening that ended up being more hectic and distracting than we had planned.  When the driver delivered the fsecond round, he told us that the item we ordered online was not available on the menu anymore, and that the guy who took our order was \\"new\\" and should not have taken it.

I've already recommended it to my friends and can't wait until they start office delivery to North Austin.  \\n\\nI have a few minor recommendations/ issues: the dressing comes inside of the mason jar in a 2oz container.  This takes up room in the mason jar that could be used for greens.  I always feel like I get to the end of the salad and don't have enough greens left.  And, it would be great if we could give a :30min increment for latest delivery time (for example, I leave for work at 8:40a but have to select 8a as my latest delivery time, which is right when I am in the shower).

It's a fun, trendy, but fairly casual atmosphere with a lot of groups, couples, and families. We sat outside which was bright, clean, and service was great. We ordered the heirloom tomato salad with almond ricotta (refreshing, tasty, vegan starter). Next were the edamame dumplings (soft, delicious, ravioli with a edamame pur√©e in a delicious sauce) Definitely start with these if you do a starter! We split the ancient grains bowl (hubby got chicken and I had it regular) and we loved it. The pumpkin pesto makes everything come together and the veggies were grilled/charred to perfection. Filling and good portion. We split the quinoa inside out burger too. Very light, bright Greek flavors, comes with a kale side and sweet potato hash. We cut it up like a salad since it's a bit delicate to eat like an actual burger. The kale and hash were good, nothing special in terms of flavor. If you're looking for a healthy dinner spot with lots of different choices, you'll love Truefood. We are excited to try more items each time we come.

There was a nice big sign explaining that the lunch special was teriyaki chicken and gyoza, which sounded good. I literally only waited two or three minutes before my food was ready.

She was incredibly sweet. On the flipside, there was one hostess who I won't mention by name here, but was incredibly rude to both mine and Neal's wife. \\n\\nHonestly, with a 2 1/2 hour wait, I remain stunned that someone would be so rude to anyone in our party. Like Neal, I am giving Moonshine 2 stars instead of 1 star because the food is excellent, some of the best in Austin. The decor and ambiance as well at Moonshine is also excellent. But being forced to wait 2 1/2 hours and not figuring out a way to accomodate us sooner, along with the rude hostess, and the fact that while sitting there waiting, no one offered to bring us a round of drinks and an appetizer was pretty appalling. \\n\\nI also second Neal regarding the party of 30. It goes back again to what he said about Moonshine needing to take reservations on a Saturday night. How can you justify having 1 person show up in a party of 30 an hour and a half ahead of time and then that group is sat right away, but punished 6 people who all came at the same time and did not pull anything?

If I broke my jaw and it was wired shut, I'd take those fish wings in suppository form. This review is not about the food. \\n\\nYou know how sometimes there's a restaurant right across the street from your favorite place, and you never go there because your favorite place completely overshadows it? And once in a while, you find your favorite place closed - maybe there was a flood - and you walk into the ugly stepsister restaurant, only to discover that it's been a beautiful swan hot stepsister all along, and now you have a new favorite? Well, this isn't about that, either. \\nI called Pok Pok last night to make sure they're open on Mondays, because I reallllly wanted some wings and some crab fried rice. The comely female voice on the answering machine confirmed my hopes, and off I went, teenager in tow, pretty much across town, practically choking on saliva, for some tasty Thai and a nice bourbon. \\nPok Pok was closed. A sign on a chain said (I paraphrase) \\"Closed from Jan 1 - Jan 18\\". What??? What about the machine? Is it so hard to change an outgoing message? Did somebody famous create the message? Is the machine broken?\\nI called again, and this time, followed the voicemail prompt that said (paraphrasing again) \\"if you want to make a reservation for a party of six or more, or you want to know other stuff, press '3'\\", and after ringing through to another answering machine, a man's voice said (paraphrasing, now with liberties) \\"oh, by the way, we're closed until January 18, but that really pedestrian Thai place across the street is open today and dying to poach your business\\", and hence my daughter and I walked across the street, asked if their food wasn't just delicious and every bit as satisfying as Pok Pok's (they had the good sense not to lie. Actually, they were appropriately apologetic that we even ended up there, and for that reason I won't make a joke about their name which, like \\"The Healthy Forest Initiative\\", means pretty much the opposite of what it is. Well, OK, I made the joke, so I won't say their name), and because they couldn't convince us that their food was desirable in any way, we bailed and headed for the familiarity of La Buca. \\n\\nBottom line, Pok Pok, luring me across town with the promise (saying you're open on your voice mail is a form of promise) of something you then deny me - that's bad juju. So, I still desire you and won't put a pox on you this time, but you have to change your outgoing message and never make that Customer Service gaffe again.

The restaurant was still lively when we arrived, but not packed, which was nice. We took far too long checking out the wine menu-it was good with a decent amount of variety but not amazing. We chose an unidentified bottle from Mendoza (so it was probably a Malbec relative) and it was pretty good. The bread basket they start with was delicious, one of the options was garlic-y and delicious. Hoping to make it to dessert, my fiance and I decided to forgo an appetizer. For our steaks, he got the ribeye and I got the filet mignon, both ordered medium rare. We had been talking about cooking styles with the server and mine was supposed to be more on the medium side of medium rare and my fiances was supposed to be more on the rare end. It looked like they were flipped, as mine appeared way more rare. It wasn't a huge deal (we're not that picky) it was just something I noticed. We decided to split the jalepeno creamed corn (amazing amazing amazing) and the starch special of the day, the loaded baked potato. While I could have taken 3 more servings of the corn I barely touched the potato, I didn't think it was very good at all. We got the chocolate caramel cake which was okay but the real star was the caramel sea salt ice cream on top. The service was amazing throughout the meal and the ambiance was top notch as well. While the meal was good, it wasn't great. If I am going to drop 200 on a meal (hey, we're not rich) I would hope it would give more of the wow factor. Will I ever be back?

It's definitely a popular place, with the brunch seatings still packing the interior (and outdoor seating areas) at nearly 2 PM. Although we had to wait a little bit, the host was very apologetic and chatted us up while we waited for a spot to get cleared. When it did, we got seated quickly, with our orders taken quickly, and honey biscuits served on the house - a very kind gesture, given there were 6 of us.\\n\\nAs for the food - the biscuits is probably the best place to start, and they are phenomenally good. They're not quite as fluffy as your average Southern biscuit would be, but the honey gives it that tinge of sweetness that works really well with the buttery taste of the biscuit. Combine it with additional honey butter you can spread on, and you have a decadent (if maybe not the healthiest) treat to start off brunch just right. For my main course, I went big and tried the cinnamon French toast out, which came with a heaping dosage of melted Belgian chocolate. It's so good, but it's almost too decadent from a sweetness perspective to be considered a true brunch dish. It's also huge - so plan on sharing the French toast if you order it. Because the bread and chocolate is still warm, every bite is just a chewy hunk of sweet deliciousness. There are plenty of other variations of French toast served here, and I have to think it's hard to go wrong with any of them. The side of corned beef hash that we ordered for the table was also very well-done; the beef was shredded and stringy, a good way of serving it when cooked together with lightly (s)mashed potatoes.\\n\\nI sampled pretty much everyone else's dish as well, and everything else I had a bite of was really good as well. Just on what I had alone, I'd say this is a top-notch brunch spot. Add on top the very personable waiters, the host who comped us the biscuits, and a very casual, laid-back atmosphere that doesn't reek of pretension despite how good the food is, and you have a brunch spot that would've made me gone broke from excessive visitation if I was a college student in this area back in the day.

After a particularly awful flying experience earlier in the day, we were luckily saved by Island Creek Oyster Bar for a fantastic dinner. We didn't have reservations but lucked out scoring two seats at the bar around 9pm. \\n\\nFirst thing's first - drinks! They have a wide variety of carefully curated beer, wine, cocktails, and spirits. I ordered the Stone Road ($12), a roasted corn tequila cocktail with lemon and blueberry. It was a fantastic, well-balanced cocktail. Perfect for the summer. Their cocktail program is very creative.\\n\\nWe ordered half a dozen Island Creek oysters ($2.75/each). These oysters are from Duxbury Farm in Maine, and they are really good! Not a lot of brine and well-balanced, very fresh. I ordered the lobster roe noodles ($36), and my BF ordered the roasted Maine chicken ($28). The lobster roe noodles have braised shortribs, grilled lobster, oyster mushrooms, and pecorino, while the roasted Maine chicken has roasted fingerling potatoes and green beans. I LOVED the lobster roe noodles. A bit pricey, but it's filling, decadent, and oh so tasty. It's got the best of both land and sea. Best lobster noodle dish I've ever had. The roasted chicken also had great flavor. \\n\\nService was on point too. Ambiance was just right. I love the decor of the restaurant too; it's very modern and chic.

The crepe dough had a perfect texture and consistency while the filling was heated to perfection.  The savory flavor of the melted cheese, ham, and potatoes is something dreams are made of.  Truly.  I really liked that seasoned potato wedges were added to the crepe.  It gave a twist to a classic combination and gave the crepe a hardy feel.  For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Mousse crepe which was also simply sublime.  The filling was very rich and the whipped cream topping was beyond decadent.  While the food was the main highlight of the restaurant, I have no complaints about the service.  It was quick and friendly, but not overly warm and hospitable.  Another note of caution: while the price of one crepe is reasonable, realize that you probably won't have the self control to stop at one.  This makes the bill more expensive, but in my opinion, worth it."},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I wish there was more than five stars.

By this I mean that only Indian restaurants in Chicago will bring you sizzling Tandoori chicken to your table. I've never seen that in Ohio, and I've lived here my whole life. \\n\\nWhat an excellent Indo restaurant in these parts WILL give you is an experience you haven't had before in its buffet, a tip of its hat to authenticity, and ask you to be brave and adventurous. That's when you will realize what I mean.\\n\\nI give Amul India a 5 star rating because of its decision to have Goat curry in its weekend buffet. If you don't know, goat curry is a delicacy in many parts of India, but not the parts that get represented in America. Usually, those parts are vegetarian, and even non-vegetarian Indian restaurants err on the side of chicken or lamb. Having been raised on Ma's excellent goat curry, I was very pleased with their choice, and can affirm the quality of the goat curry. \\n\\nI will also give Amul India a 5 because the choice of goat is not only authentic, but its vast array of desserts and appetizers, not limited to the irritatingly common gulab jamun and pakora, encourages one to find more about Indian cuisine to savor.\\n\\nFinally, I give Amul India a 5 because it does all of the above while providing the staples of the normal buffet: palak paneer, chicken makhani, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, and the usual veggie dishes. In doing so, it demands that you transcend the normal, bland Indian food experience promoted by the Taj Mahal-type restaurants that has Columbus locals raving about an Indian food an Indian from India would hardly recognize."},{"name":"Taco Time","address":"701 West Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"In a rush on my lunch break while craving something with a kick I decided to stop in at Taco Time.

A recent article about the proposed facelift to the southwest corner justified the over-the-top design by noting that every time they remodel, sales go up. \\n\\nYeah well ... every time they remodel, the prices on the books go up.  \\n\\nPeople who love books and are visiting Portland still should absolutely make a stop -- Oregonians who are used to used bookstores, and people who have internet access, can do well to patronize other independent bookstores.  It is also Portland's best bet for book browsing (not knowing what you want to read next), given the extremely well organized and massive, massive, massive quantity. \\n\\nI still buy at Powell's if I need the book that day, but it's not what it used to be:  Once, the great thing about Powell's was that you could find new and used copies of most titles, sitting beside each other, with an array of prices on the used (according to condition).  There were also just a few copies of each title, encouraging a wide selection on each subject. \\n\\nNow, fewer titles have used copies on the shelves, there seem to be more copies of fewer titles, all of the used books have comparatively high prices, and too many titles are only available new.  Worst of all is that so many used copies have remainder marks (the black permanent marker on the bottom edge) -- the very same used books Powell's refuses to buy, the ones you can find on Abebooks.com for a buck apiece, the ones that are basically castoffs from overprints.  In other words, the used stock has a high percentage of books nobody wanted to buy .  Clearance books, not used books.  Continuing to label these books as \\"used\\", and sell them while refusing to buy them, is kinda a sneaky way to keep marketing the brand as one that participates in \\"recycling\\" books directly with consumers.  \\n\\nOne could argue the higher price has to do with better technology -- it is delightful to have so many kiosks in the store where you can look up your book and get a very precise location -- but the \\"technology\\" sucks.  I searched for several titles online, found that several copies were in stock, came to the store, and then could not find the location.  In fact, their computer said they were out.  I asked for help from a staff person, who admitted the Powell's website is more reliable than the in-store software (but no, they won't put the Powell's website on those in-store computers instead of the software that doesn't work). \\n\\nNice that even though the parking garage was bought by Smart Park, Powell's patrons can get free parking.  A little -- just an hour, and the spaces in the garage have decreased by half, but I can't deny the disappearance of the old Powell's Parking experience is a good thing (if you don't remember, look at the posts and where the lines used to be and you'll understand -- that space was never meant for parking).  \\n\\nIt does beat Eugene's Smith Family in that Smith Family has no data about what books they have in stock, and where to find them, but the classic Oregon used book treasure-hunting experience is definitely now in Eugene with Smith Family, not in Portland's Powell's."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Honestly I was going to give it a 3-3.5.

As many reviewers have said, they've eaten this place breakfast lunch and dinner, and I wish I had a 4th meal on it too! The cafeteria style is kind of cool, you get to see them chop up your dinner and put it on the scale, it's best if you share and the sauce is aplenty!\\n\\nWhile you wait in line, there are rows and buckets of cold chilled beers and other beverages you can take apart in and just pay up at the counter. They have this awesome hand washing system too which sprays water on your hand while it turns which completely cleans off the delicious BBQ sauce.\\n\\nHIGHLY recommend the EXTRA MOIST brisket! You will not regret this (although your cholesterol might ...) but it's soooo worth it. Also the mac and cheese, very rich ... but brisket is the only way to go. I'm speechless and craving Rudy's right now!"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Slow bar service, like really really slow.

I think they were of the same ethnicity with the cashier (a shady looking guy, who in itself made me lose my appetite) because they were blabbing to each other in the same language like they had all the time in the world. It took what could have taken about 5 minutes for me to order, take about 15-20. This inconsiderate act resulted in my inevitable tardiness to class. \\n\\nThe chicken schawarma that I didn't order was the worst of its kind that I've ever tasted.

At 6:30, the hostess told me the wait would be 1hr 15 minutes. It was every bit of that and MORE. With 3 hungry children. The free seasoned popcorn was so yummy, we didn't mind the first hour. But at the 1.5 hour mark no one wanted popcorn anymore. It. was. worth. the. wait. The shrimp corn dogs are a clever, fun way to do shrimp. My picky 6 yr old really enjoyed them. The hatch Chile macaroni as cheese was SUPERB! with chunks of chicken and corn, it is truly a meal all by itself. I had it and so did my daughter. The macaroni has the perfect amount of heat - enough that you need to sip water in between bites, but not so spicy that you can't appreciate the flavor. If if get too spicy, the cornbread bites that our waiter brought to the table were the perfect  size to take off some of the edge. The other son ordered chicken and waffles. The waffle was perfectly sweet without syrup, but not too sweet to make you cringe. He gobbled up the chicken so quickly, and never offered to share!  The hubs got the catfish dish, and he enjoyed that too. I was so full and satisfied with the macaroni I didn't even take my usual bites of his food. dessert was the chocolate brownie which actually wasn't great, but we had enjoyed the entrees so much we really  didn't mind. The brownie was crumbly, not the chewy, cake like texture I prefer. But it was warm and topped with yummy chocolate ice cream, so we demolished it. Our server was super nice and very attentive without being a stalker. Awesome customer service from the front door to the table! We will go back when we are in austin. just maybe not at 6:30 on a weekday.

If not for this place, I wouldn't have discovered yummy Thai food and awesome chicken wings here. If you're strapped for time, and in need to eat something spicy and crispy, I highly recommend getting some wings here. Infused with various spices and fish sauce, the wings are pretty tasty and unique. Crispy without being too dry or oily, the wings do serve as a great appetizer or even a meal if you get a side of some delicious coconut rice to go with it. \\n\\nIf you have more time to try out some of the other food, I recommend spending some time and reviewing the menu. A lot of the dishes may not seem too familiar so reading the descriptions were pretty helpful. Other than the wings I tried, also had the opportunity to eat: Hoi Thawt (it's like fried dough with a ton of seafood inside), Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\" (spin off of a famous Vietnamese catfish dish), Kaeng Hang Leh (pork belly), and a side of coconut rice. All of these were equally delicious and super flavorful in its own way. \\n\\nThe Hoi Thawt was full of yummy seafood that tasted fresh and the dough used was similar to how Vietnamese crepes are made. For the Cha Ca \\"La Vong,\\" the catfish itself was very tasty....once you find it in the sea of vegetables. Personally, I would have liked more catfish than veggies (given the price) but it was an interesting dish to eat. As for the pork belly, this was sooooo good when you pair it with some coconut rice. The pork belly was very soft and juicy and the sauce used for it for a little sweet and salty. Add in the rice, and it's one solid meal. \\n\\nPortion wise, I shared these dishes with a friend and surprisingly, the portions weren't as big as I thought. For a Thai restaurant, this place was a bit more upscale (prices are a bit higher than your average Thai restaurant) and it's nice how big the place was. Service was a bit slow when things got busy but overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. If I get the chance, I would definitely stop by here again to try out the other foreign sounding dishes and get more of that coconut rice + chicken wings. =]"},{"name":"Chung Ki Wa","address":"27 Riverside Ave","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"I was a huge fan of Chung Ki Wa's lunch menu.

First bite into the pizza and it was disappointment all over again. Only this time it wasn't a lopsidedly cooked pizza, it was just plain under cooked!! So, Olympia Pizza I give you the lowest rating I can for something that is so easy to get right. Your staff on the phone are great, your delivery drivers are great. Your chef/cook/kitchen person who sticks things in warm ovens but has no clue what they are doing, is doing it all wrong.\\n \\nI may try ordering again someday to cautiously test the waters (and your kitchen staff) but don't expect me to order anything from your restaurant in house or for delivery for quite some time.

I could not find it anywhere on the walls in the entry way, so I went over to the bar area and looked on the walls there.  On the wall were many different papers but I didn't see the health department report.  Then, I saw a yellow piece of paper that was covered by a white piece of paper.  Not wanting to walk up and move papers behind the bar, I asked a restaurant worker if she could show me their health department report.  She said that she couldn't find it, so I suggested that she move the paper that appeared to be in front of the yellow paper.  She did so, and the yellow paper was indeed the health report.  The good news is the restaurant got an 86, which is not the worst score I've ever seen. The bad news is that it was out of compliance for insects, bugs and rodents.  Had I been there with just my husband or one other friend, I would have left at that point.  However, I was with a big group.  I shared this with them.  They are all far less germophobic than I am, and they agreed we would stay at the restaurant.\\n\\nThen, they took us back to our table.  After we settled in, I told our waiter that I had a Groupon for $50 off the bill (I'd paid $25).  He said that was fine and that I just needed to show it to him when he brought the bill.  \\n\\nWe ordered and received appetizers (samosas and naan), which both tasted fine.\\n\\nThen, one of our friends received his meal.  Yep, you read that right, just one of us.  Of course, we told him to go ahead and eat so that his food wouldn't get cold - thinking that ours would be coming right behind his.  It was at least another 30-40 minutes before any other food came.  Our friend who received his food had eaten all of his food and put his plate aside well before anyone else received any food.  Another restaurant employee came out to apologize, saying they were slammed.  We saw maybe 10 groups in the entire restaurant.\\n\\nAfter the food came, another friend mentioned that not one table had been bussed since we'd arrived.  I began looking around and saw that almost every table was littered with debris from other diners.  It also appeared that this wasn't an issue for the restaurant staff, since no one was coming around to clean any of it up.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the food tasted good.  We had Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Biryani, something that looked like an Indian version of a fajita with lamb, shrimp, and green (!), red and regular colored chicken, a couple of vegetarian dishes and I think one or two other dishes closer to the other end of the table.  Everyone liked their food.\\n\\nThen, the time came for us to pay our bill.  A different individual who we had not dealt with before came out to bring us our bill.  When I told him we had a Groupon, he told me that I couldn't use it, because the Groupon was only for tables of two or four.  To be fair, when I went back to the Groupon site after returning home, it did say that it was $50 off for four people.  My assumption, however, was that they meant at least four people.  It would seem to me that bringing a group of 10 people to a restaurant would meet the acceptable limit for a four person Groupon.  I am, though, willing to accept that I should have done a better job of understanding what I was buying.  \\n\\nAs we were on our way out, we walked through a restaurant absolutely full of dirty, debris-covered tables and did not see anyone in the restaurant doing any cleaning.  It made sense that they have a bug / rodent problem if dirty dishes are left out for extended periods of time.\\n\\nAt the door, the gentleman who told me that I couldn't use the Groupon said that I would have to use my Groupon \\"the next time\\" I come to the restaurant.  Regardless of whether they should have honored the Groupon or not, given all the other issues with the restaurant, it's safe to say there will not be a next time."},{"name":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews","address":"250 Granite St, Unit 1094E","city":"Braintree","stars":"2.5","text":"Worse experience ever went to have dinner and ordered a lemonade when it arrived to table found a long hair inside of the cup.

We went heavy on the savory side of the make your own pancakes, double bacon, sausage, mushrooms, all the cheese varieties, et al. For dishes we settled on huevos rancheros and biscuits and gravy. The table first opened up with bloody mary's and a mimosa, both impeccable. When the food came...none of us were ready. We ate - we fought the mounds of food like kings of lore and in the end the table sat empty. But not without a price.....a dark cloud of laziness and naps came upon us. \\n\\nGod...I want biscuits and gravy after just typing out that shitty story.

Jeez, leave room for a little mystery next time!). \\n\\nMy debacles with Asian food have been well chronicled, and occasionally used as visual aids for those learning what not to do in Asian restaurants. But I was sick of being the object of ridicule and waiters' scathing looks, so I gladly accepted the dinner lesson invitation from two acclaimed masters. Another good friend and foodie joined us much to our delight (it was Kimberly K Alright? Geeze, do you open your presents on Christmas Eve too?)\\n\\nIt was apparent we were in the company of pros as soon as the waiter appeared. The menu was waved off and our hosts rattled off a list of food with the no nonsense air of people who know what they want. I was in awe.  Not wanting to disrupt the flow of information, I waited until I'd politely downed almost all of my ice cold Tsing Tao before asking what we were going to eat. 'They're out of ------ (something I can't pronounce) which is a shame, because it's great here'. I was so thrilled by the inference that I'd know great Chinese food from bad Chinese food I didn't bother to learn more.  I just basked in my newfound coat of expertise. \\n\\nBut the coat fell apart as soon as the food arrived. First a large Soupcon of Hot & Sour soup that I found delicious. Then plates piled high with BBQ pork, some kind of tasty beef, some sort of spicy noodle, some kind of chicken, and a fried seafood, possibly squid. It may have been eel but I don't think so. I hate eels and revel in anything that kills them, and the more painful the better as far as I'm concerned.  But if it were eel  I'm sure I'd have a more visceral joy at eating them, so I'm going to say it was squid. It was delicious though. \\n\\nIn fact everything was.  Abundant flavor, no cloying sauces, perfectly steamed sticky rice, a really nice and spicy pepper & oil condiment that I want to go back for, and huge portions. I ate with a confidence I'd never known in an Asian restaurant, Secure in the knowledge that my food Spirit Guides had my back. \\n\\nLooking around as I jammed food into my mouth with childish glee, I noticed the place was full. It seemed like the Sunday Dinner place to go for a significant number of Middle Austiners.  This made me oddly happy. Like I'd finally been let in on the secret. \\n\\nAlmost as cool as the food was the price. Dinner for 5 with wine and beer and tip was under $100. Sweet Mother of General Tso Chicken that's a deal!\\n\\nAt the end of the dinner our sage friends suggested going next door for smoothies and bubble tea. With the knowing look of the insider I nodded and we rose and departed my new favorite restaurant.  I knew I'd be back. In my mind's eye I saw myself, filled with newfound knowledge waving away the menu and instead confidently locking eyes with the waiter as I ordered \\"That chicken thing, and the BBQ Pork, and that beef thing too. Oh, and some of that fried stuff, and those spicy noodle things too please, and soup!\\" \\n\\nYes.

It comes with shrimp, chicken, mushroom, tomato, with udon. I had to request to change it to rice vermicelli instead of udon because I don't think that it will go well with that type of noodle. I think it is really weird that it comes with udon in the first place.\\n\\nI was really disappointed about my Tom Yum soup because it tasted more like tomato soup and it lacked the Thai spices and flavors that I was looking for. I wished I had ordered something else because I had some of my friends food and they were fantastic! One of them ordered the Pad Kra Pow and another ordered Lemon Duck.

When we got there at about 730 there were perhaps a dozen people inside. Maybe that was the first bad sign...\\nThe place has great decor, it's a nice little spot, but it was so dark at our table we had to use the lights on our phones to read the menu. \\nWe ordered the \\"nachos\\" which were waffle fries with pulled pork, pico de gallo and sour cream on top and they were pretty good. The pork had a nice smokiness. It was a winner. Things went down hill from there...\\nAfter being told they were out of the Brussels sprouts, I ended up ordering the two-meat plate with brisket, spare ribs baked beans and macaroni and cheese. The waitress was new and she couldn't tell me if I could choose between the point or the flat of the brisket, which was unfortunate. What came out looked like a bit of a mess. I ended up getting about three \\"slices\\" of brisket which looked like they were all taken off the point and two spare ribs (they were full spare ribs, not St. Louis cut) and the sides were in individual cups. The brisket was not what I'm used to seeing. There were a couple think slices and then one long chunk that looked like it had been pulled off the top with the grain of the meat. Over all the brisket tasted pretty good. Nice bark, good smoke, juicy and tender. Probably the highlight of the meal, but the piece that was pulled instead of sliced had big long stands of meat that made it difficult to eat. You just don't serve it like that.\\nThe ribs were unremarkable. Decent flavor, a little tough and overdone. \\nThe beans were ok. Spicier than I'm used to, but not bad. The Mac and cheese was actually farfalle and cheese....and it was terrible. No salt. I took one bite and pushed it aside. \\nNow for the sauce. There are three kinds on the table. A Kansas City style sauce, a vinegar sauce and white NC style sauce. The KC style sauce you expect to be fairly good and standard but, holy cumin batman! It was super overpowered by cumin which rendered it completely incompatible with the meat. The other two sauces were decent but nothing special. \\nWe were so disappointed by the end of the meal that we skipped the promising looking cast iron cobblers and the mud pie and just decided to settle the bill.

The taste, texture, everything is just perfection. \\n\\nIt's served with thick toast and home fries. Which brings me to another reason I love Early Harvest - they are super cool about substitutions. I'm not a fan of home fries (as a rule, but even here they're good) and it's a peeve of mine that most restaurants fill half your plate with them and typically refuse to substitute.

I was invited to an outing at this location and was happy to accept. The aroma of the smoked meats hits you as you walk through the door. The buck pretty much stops there. Out of the seven guests at my table, nobody was thrilled with their food. I'm actually quite disappointed that I have to type a review like this. I'll start with the sauce. There are 3 bottles at each table ranging from tomato based, vinegar based, and mayo based. NONE of them are/were good. The food could have had more flavor. I ordered the pulled sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese. I had no idea cold slaw came on top of the sandwich. I hate cold slaw. The sandwich did not have much flavor and I bit into hunks of fat twice. My mac and cheese was \\"ok\\". My words are minimal compared to what I had to endure hearing as others complained the entire time we were there. Some of our party ordered cocktails and only 2 people were pleased with their beverage. Overall, I've had way better BBQ from Sonny's of all places.

Some highlights: Oyster sliders (may cause a temporary disconnect from reality), crunchy breaded oyster, some kind of creamy chipotle aioli and brioche? HEAVEN!  Asian inspired fluke crudo...super tasty and a little spicy!  Salmon tartar with the diced red onion and (I think) cuke, tasted fresh and was uber satisfying!  By the way, get a shrimp cocktail: U-12 Shrimps are meaty and worth it!\\n\\nOnto service...First off, there was a 45 min wait for a walk in on a Tuesday.  No big deal (it's worth the wait).  We left our phone number with the hostess and walked down the street to get a cocktail at ES (the Island Creek Bar was also packed).  We're half way down the block when the hostess comes running up to us- the computer glitched and she lost half our number.  She chased us down for it!  It was awesome!  We had one drink and were promptly called back for our table.  \\n\\nI am pretty sure that ISOB uses duel service...my first time there it was a little strange because the restaurant was empty so it seemed weird having two servers- especially because their personalities were so different, so my friend and I ended up clicking more with 1 server than the other. But last night, when they were swamped, the duel service really worked to their advantage.  When the initial server that greeted us was too busy, the other server really stepped in and made sure that we had everything we needed.  The only minor flub was that we had to wait 10 minutes for my friend's vodka tonic, but the rest of the service was so good and friendly, and the food was so good, that we soon forgot all about it!\\n\\nAlso, I'm not sure if this is standard practice or not, but both times that I have gone, we have gotten complimentary digestifs at the end of the meal.  Both times that this happened, the drinks were very different, but seemed tailor made for me and my friend.  The first time, the shot was fruity and bright pink (to match my bff's hair, as the server pointed out)- perfect for a girls night out!  The second time was their yummy house made Irish cream, which went great with our coffees and made my Irish-American date's evening!  Little things like that make you totally feel VIP!\\n\\nYay, ISOB!

Columbus, OH was lunch and I'm so glad that I found this place on Yelp.\\n\\nMy requirements were pretty simple:\\n- food doesn't suck\\n- stop doesn't take too long\\n- not a national fast food chain\\n- something for both PITA (about meals) teenager daughters who can never agree on a meal\\n\\nThis place met each of those requirements.\\n\\nKid 1 went with a chicken basil pasta.  I snagged a bite and it was really good.  Very big on the basil taste and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  I also liked that they used olive oil instead of butter.  She didn't want the garlic bread thing that came with her meal so I inherited that bit of yumminess even though it didn't pair well with my lobster bisque.\\n\\nKid 2 had something called a steak piada.  It was a similar to a quesadilla but different enough that the comparison ends with thin, griddled and filled.  I managed a bite and it was quite flavorful.  Good steak flavor, fresh vegetables and a little spice from the sauce.  All I managed was a single bite - she snarfed up the rest of it.\\n\\nWe split an order of calamari also.  Instead of rings, they cut the squid into strips and hand-breaded it before frying.  Not sure that I have ever had fresh calamari in a place that resembled a Chipotle but it was damn good.\\n\\nI also ordered a parmesean piada as a side because I didn't think the soup would be enough for me.  That sucker was delicious!  Think about how much you enjoy those crispy pieces of melted and browned parmesean cheese that result from accidentally (or deliberately in our house) putting a little too much paresean on something before baking or broiling.  Now take that rare bite and turn it into a side dish.  Soooooo good!  Didn't really pair well with the lobster bisque but oh well - both were delicious in their own rights and the kids ate most of my soup anyway.\\n\\nHey there Piada people - if you read this review please add St. Louis to your list of coming locations!"},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The service was lousy and spoiled the evening.

It was tacky wait staff behavior and still wasn't the right food.  The much-vaunted jalapeno creamed corn uses frozen corn by the way ~ really?  Can't they afford to serve fresh ingredients?   This is one of the most expensive steak houses in Atlanta with the worst service staff of any of them.

I'm a Thai curry fanatic, and can attest that both the red and green curries (with which I had chicken) were marvellous. The chef is straight from Thailand, and it shows - the curries tasted just like the ones I had in some of the great little holes-in-the-wall I stumbled across in central and southern Thailand. As a spice fiend, I asked for the curries \\"Thai spicy and then some\\", and while they still could have been hotter, they were far closer to the level of spice I wanted than I had expected they would be.The stir-fries my dining partner ordered - the Pad Prig Khing and the Pad Kratiem Prig Thai, both with chicken - were also excellent, as was the remarkable jasmine rice we ordered on the side. The only slight blip was the Tom Yum Gai, which was a little too sweet for my tastes.

Even my 18 year old they wanted me to sign a waiver for... Very strange! 2- Every time you walk around the corner after getting out of the elevator they attack you with vacation club sales pitch. I just wanted to chill there, I was spending enough money. The last thing I wanted was to be sold more Marriott goods. 3- No plungers in the rooms and the toilets flush very weakly.

The waitress suggested I try the smoked wings which she raved about, and then remembered they were out of wings. So we placed our orders, which both included brisket. We also ordered the nachos which was the best thing we ate. The only highlight of the meal. After about 20 minutes after ordering our waitress informed us that they were also out of brisket and we would have to order something else. My husband went with the duck burger with pork belly *can't remember the name of it) and I ordered the ribs with bleu cheese potato salad and bacon and corn on the cobb with cotija. The potato was really underseasoned and I didn't see or taste bacon or bleu cheese. I did taste the very sharp mustard they use, which overpowered any other flavor. The ribs were mediocre, not seasoned very well, and the corn seemed like it had been boiled and topped with cotija cheese. Nothing like the elote or mexican street corn the waitress described. The final failure of the evening was my husbands burger. The chef apparently left off the vegetables that were supposed to go on the burger, and put the duck, pork belly and queso only. The bread was soggy and mushy when it arrived (probably because of all the queso) and it was really underwhelming. After discussing this with the waitress she mentioned the chef was new and that she had to remind him to put the queso. \\nIt was a real disappointment for my husbands birthday.

So good we started dipping bread in the saut√©.\\n\\nFor primi, Tammy had Fettucine ai Frutti di Mare - fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, tomato, garlic, and parsley. The broth was just so good. The fettucine was more like a spaghtti - and fresh made pasta. My dish was similar, Pappardelle Mare e Monti. Same ingredients except the thick pappardelle noodles, and most succulent porcini mushrooms and a splash of Cognac. Salad was insalata con arance, orange slices, over baby arugula, and shaved fennel, with o-juice and oil. \\n\\nFor dolci, Tartufo, a chocolate gelato with Zabaglione cream center, covered in carmelized hazelnuts. And a cappuccino, of course.\\n\\nOur wine selection was a really bold, cheery Caparzo 2010 Sangiovese Toscana (Tuscany) with a dark cherry tone and hints of spice.

For my entree I split the ancient grains bowl with my mom as well as the margherita pizza. Both were excellent. The ancient grains bowl had a lot of diverse flavors in it and it was interesting to experiment with what vegetables I liked paired together. True food kitchen is appealing to the health-conscious eater which means the portion sizes are on the smaller size.

I had heard so much about it over the years and, loving books as much as I do, I knew I would have to check it out one day. To say that I enjoyed my time at Powell's Books is an understatement. Powell's Books is huge and simply amazing, with multiple levels of book sections and a wide variety of categories for browsing and selection. Even better, suitable space is devoted to each section, allowing for each section to have a more fully developed selection. Where else can you go to see a Nature section divided into extensive subsections of Mountaineering and Nautical Studies. (Yes, I know, it is the Pacific Northwest, but still...!) Powell's Books does a great job of featuring books of local interest. Looking for gifts for my friends' children, I found some excellent children's picture books that used the natural environment of the Pacific Northwest as their theme. One note of caution: I think it is easy to feel overwhelmed by the size and selection of Powell's Books on a first visit, so you might just want to pace yourself and ease yourself into your browsing, but you will be happy that you made it here and will look forward to your next visit.

These jalapenos were fresh too, when I took each bite I could see a vibrant and beautifully cut piece of jalapeno every other bite. The onions, I wouldn't say were \\"fried\\" but roasted. I particularly love onions, so I thought they were a great touch. The pico de gallo was fresh and again, light but flavorful. Finally, the cheese was perfect in it's quantity.

You can taste the freshness in everything they offer in their menu. This place is worth a visit. Let me not forget to mention their margaritas are off the chain good. My favorite being the spicy mango margarita made with tequila infused everyday at the restaurants with different types of peppers. Best Mexican restaurant in Orlando.

With a 7:30 reservation, we were able to beat the crowd and get optimal seating near the band. From start to finish everything about this place was good: I had the shrimp medley and it was awesome. The fried cheesecake dessert was grand as well. After dining we danced the rest of the evening to the sounds of the live jazz band who played everything from Anita Baker to Phil Collins to Marvin Gaye. They even did a tribute to Michael Jackson. The only drawback to this place is that they aren't good about reservation times. They are trying to push you out of there as soon as you're done eating. They should honor 2 hr windows or something to better serve their patrons. The interior decor is beautiful and intimate but this isn't the place for a private date. The seating is so close together that there's no privacy. Even still, the pros outweigh the cons and I look forward to many more evenings at SAMBUCA :-)"},{"name":"Pon Thai Bistro","address":"213 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Pon Thai Bistro in Brookline Village with great service but very average food.

We are incredibly disappointed and I am planning on calling the manager later to ask what happened--perhaps they were short staffed, but I didn't understand why me and my family were treated so disrespectfully, even though we were paying customers.

But I was taken on a date here by a huge steak eater, so I thought why not.  The ambience here was wonderful with just enough lighting and the place was totally packed on a Monday night at 8, which should say something.  My date and I ordered the filet mignon medium well (I got the 6 oz. and he got the 12 oz.), which by the way, the 6 oz. was the perfect portion.  Normally I'm a well done girl, but the dark lighting helped me deal with meat that was probably pinker than I would prefer.  I got it with the black truffle butter, which was like heaven in my mouth.  If you're not a steak person, definitely get the filet with this butter, and you will become a steak person.  I ordered the mac and cheese and my side and my date ordered the mashed potatoes.  The potatoes seemed pretty average, but the mac and cheese was delicious!! It wasn't your typical mac and cheese and had a sort of sweet taste to it.  For dessert, we ordered the apple pie-like dessert, which was also good, but not as good as I would have expected.

If you are a moderate eater, you will never get your money's worth.\\n\\nI find it odd that only in Japanese sushi houses do they charge for soda water from the dispenser. When i asked the server about it, she agreed not to charge us, but said it is their customary practice to do so.\\n\\nFor sushi lovers, there is a lot of variety. Very very nice. But the rolls are tiny - not at all like the big rolls you get from sitting at a sushi bar where the chef makes them in front of you.  Having said that, the sushi chef was able/willing to make my daughter the type of rolls she wanted so she did not have to use the dirty tongs to pick up the tiny sticky roll pieces pre-cut on the buffet line. \\n\\nThere was a decent selection of salads. There are dumplings of 2 sorts, and many deep fried, sweet sauced meats, and other unknown creations.  There was also a dessert line that had 3 types of flavorless cookies, 2 types of soft serve ice cream, jello chunks, small tiramisu cups, pudding cups and fresh fruit.\\n\\nI do not eat flour or sugar, so my choices were quite limited. There was barely any pure protein that didn't come smothered in some sugary sauce.

Or at least that's how the crust is. Reminds me an awful lot of the pizza I was exposed to growing up in St. Louis. Only at Rubino's, they use slices of cheese. I think it's provolone.

They looked fantastic!! Ok ok.. so you're wondering why I rated this place three stars? I'll tell you why.\\n\\nThe sashimi tasted ok and then that was when I tasted the yellowfin tuna.. the texture  was slimy and it had a bad odor. The white fish sashimi (sorry I forgot the specific name of it) tasted awful!! Luckily, my siblings hadn't noticed anything wrong with the fish. My dad and I noticed the UN-freshness of the raw fish. I only had one and that was it for me. The first fresh oyster I ate was ok, then the second and third oyster was awful! Oysters are not suppose to smell or taste like fish!\\n\\nSorry, Nori Nori but I tasted better sashimi elsewhere!\\n\\nThere were too many waiters and waitresses at this restaurant. They kept staring at me eating my meal. It was quite annoying! But I guess they wanted to be efficient as to moving my unwanted plates.\\n\\nThe food that I did enjoy most was the ikura sushi (salmon roe), but they add a lot of ikura in the sushi!! ARGH! That made me quite sad.. oh well. I also like this sashimi with grape seed oil and some kind of seed sprinkled on top of it (forgot the name of it). It tasted good! The crab legs were good but they weren't served hot! I like my crab legs to be hot!! But it was still tasty with the melted butter that they served in the small plastic containers. Crab lovers will enjoy this place!\\n\\nThe dessert.. heh. For the first time ever, I haven't touched any of the dessert trays lined up EXCEPT the crepe. I had the crepe with raspberries, strawberries and chocolate with whipped cream on top, then I added a swirl of green tea ice cream! Surprisingly, the green tea ice cream was soft serve BUT it was \\"da bomb\\"!! It tasted better than the vanilla ice cream! Oh my gosh!! \\n\\nOh and also my brother got his birthday cake, at first it looked delicious! We (my family) took a bite of it and it was hard.. not hard as a rock.. but pretty hard for a cake.

Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the pho.  Despite the name, Pho Basil is not a Vietnamese restaurant.  The signs?  They serve Thai red tea.  Chopsticks aren't available by default.  You have to ask for them and even then, they're the Thai design disposables.  The menu is at least two-thirds Thai.  It's really a Thai restaurant trying to capitalize on a recent Asian food trend.  That's not a problem, if they're at least good at what they're trying to capitalize on.  It's too bad they missed the mark here.\\n\\nI was only interested in trying one thing, the Pho Xe Lua with meatballs.  Before the pho arrived, a plate of pho accompaniments (to call it garnish would trivialize its importance to properly enjoy pho) was dropped off at the table  The plate consisted of bean sprouts, basil and one wedge of lime.  The only problem was that this plate was meant for one, even though my dining companion also ordered pho.  Any self respecting pho restaurant would know that these accompaniments are almost as important as the pho itself.\\n\\nThe pho arrived as ordered.  However, the broth was way too sweet.  It also had a strong taste of a sweet root vegetable.  The broth wasn't very beefy.  It was just another MSG-laden broth.  I generously offered the one wedge of lime that was on the plate to my companion while I waited for more lime.  By the time the lime arrived, the eye round was well-done and tough.  The tendons were overcooked to the point where it was just jelly.  The meatballs were a bit mealy though they did at least contain bits of tendon.\\n\\nI am a pho-holic and as far as pho goes, I really wouldn't recommend this place unless you're desperately craving it and are in the area.  I may come back, but I wouldn't order the pho or anything else Vietnamese.  I'd probably try the Thai items instead.  From what I could see, those looked pretty good.\\n\\nHere's an idea, Pho Basil.  Change your name to Pho Thai.  Get it?  It's a play on Pho Tai, the classic version of pho and your obvious Thai roots.  You can thank me later.  Oh, and please learn to serve pho properly.  Because, honestly, the pho was about an average 3 stars with potential for more.

Anyway--it was slightly frustrating. The wine is expensive for what you get-- like $10-15 a glass and is not good (we had a cab and malbec). I can get an awesome $10 glass of wine from other places because the wine buyer for the restaurant knows how to buy great wine. I also had a Sangria (since it was considered a cocktail for our coupon) and it was just so-so. Wouldn't order it again. For food we had cheeseburger sliders. The bread was dry and the burger was nothing special but the fries were good (reason for 2 stars). Next we ordered the vegetable gnocchi. I like gnocchi. I realizes Zed's isn't Italian but I thought I'd try. The menu said it had Vermouth cream sauce.

I ended up going with the Pho Sate, a spicy version of pho. It wasn't too spicy, but added a great unique tomato/chili dimension to the pho. Also enjoyed the watercress that they put in, and the beansprouts/lime/basil still work perfectly with the spicy broth.

Our waitress, who was super sweet and polite, started off by telling us they were missing about 20% of their menu (including the gravy and biscuits), even though they were only halfway through their day. She then didn't come back to take our order until around 15 minutes later. After that, we waited for around 25-30 minutes for our food, which I think were pretty basic diner menu items -- french toast, an omelet, and a montecristo french toast sandwich. We came into the diner STARVING and were almost completely brain dead by the time our food arrived.\\n\\nThat long of a wait at a 'diner' was unacceptable, but I can tell they put a lot of love into their food. My omelet, the '10 Dighton', had avocado, spicy black beans, cheddar, bell peppers, and sausage (I added sausage for a small price, the normal Dighton is vegetarian). The avocados were a-plenty, and the omelet was perfectly cooked, delicious, and moist. The omelet came with excellent toast (really, I don't know how they made the toast so well), and potato slices that were meant to be chips but ended up turning into a soggy mess. I do appreciate the effort for the chips though -- I can tell they made it themselves.\\n\\nThe french toast was, again, made with a lot of love and served with powdered sugar and warm syrup.

I live in So OR, and made the four hour trek up-state to visit 3 prospective schools. So this is a recommendation for both the school itself and the restuarant.\\n Oregon Culinary Institute was my first appointment. I was 10-15 minutes late, because I arrived an hour early and walked down to 23rd street for some leisurely window shopping. Although that was the case the Admissions officer, Kevin Richards was fantsastic!  Friendly, informative, straight-forward and answered all of my questions before I had a chance to ask them! \\n  Within 10 minutes of my arriving I met the the Executive Chef and Director of Education, Brian Wilke. Who was so lovely, charismatic, and amiable he made me feel right at home! He told me that he and his partner began this culinary school to give students a affordable way to acheive their dreams. Then Kevin lead us(\\"us\\" being my mother and I) to the first kitchen, which I could smell before I saw it! Although small, it was smoothly run. I think a smaller kitchen would be better. In the real world I won't be working in a kitchen that's bigger than my apartment(like Western Culinary). \\n     I got to see classes in action. The chef who was teaching took a break and talked with us! \\"This isn't Hell's Kitchen, an effective kitchen doesn't run that way! hahaha!\\" He is from Nepal! Which is exciting because I get to see true international cooking straight from the source!\\n   We continued moving through the other 2 kitchens who were at different stages of learning. All the while Kevin was speaking to us frankly, and explaining the going-ons. Which I LOVED! I feel well-informed i deciding on this school. But what really won me over was the FREE lunch! \\n   It has a prix fixe menu. Which changes every few weeks. The bread and desserts were prepared by their baking and Pastry students, and the restuarant is run by the late-stage students. The resturant's atmosphere is actually better than I expected. Its small, but modern, clean, and full of dark luxe wood. \\nOur server was very courteous, prompt, and attentive. \\nThe menu had two choices for the starter, salad, and dessert and three choices for the entree.\\nWhen we were ready to order our order was taken by the executive chef, Brian Wilke. We wanted to try as much as possible. So we ordered 1 of each course. And when Wilke caught wind of what we were doing he gave us the 3rd entree too! Which is so great! We got to try everything on the menu, and it was beyond amazing! \\n\\n SMOKED TOMATO BACON BISQUE-Creme Fraiche \\nCORN AND OKRA FRITTERS with Spicy Aioli. The Bisque was very nice. It was rich, hearty, and the flavor was more complex than I expected. The Fritters were a little salty on their own, but when combined with the aioli they were perfect. \\nFIG AND PROSCUITTO SALAD- Arugula, Radicchio, Gorgonzola, and wlanuts with a fig vinaigerette. It was good. A more traditional typical salad for \\"normal\\" people. The helping of proscuitto was very generous, and the sweet and salty combo was very nice.\\nGRILLED WATERMELON SALAD-Pickled melon rind, roasted onion, feta, mint, with watermelon vinaigrette. THIS WAS F-ING AMAZING!!! I may not have ordered this if I wasn't determined to try everything. I am so glad I did. This is one of the most unique delectable things I have ever tasted! EVER! Wilke explained to us that they try new things, and try not to waste anything, hence the pickled watermelon rind. The taste is comparable to pickled ginger-sort of. The combination of all these tastes and textures was so fresh and innovative! \\nENTREE:\\nMARINATED CHICKEN SANDWICH-Romaine, tapenade dressing, and gruyere cheese with grilled corn salad. The chicken sandwich was moist, and the dressing was abfab! The best chicken sandwich ever, basically. But the corn salad was surprising good! It had some halved cherry tomatoes mixed in, and I can't quite identify what the flavor was! It kills me! It was SOOO GOOD and I have no idea why or what's in it!\\nPAN SEARED SALMON-Celery root puree, and green apple ragout with shaved radish salad. The salmon was PERFECTLY cooked. Not to dry or flaky. Moist, but not buttery or oily. Just perfect. The side on this good, not as good as the rest. \\nSMOKED BBQ PORK RIBS-Potato salad with buttermilk cilantro dressing. MMMM!!!! YUMM!!! The ribs were dry-rubbed. So there was no stickiness, no sweet BBQ sauce! Just smoky deep complex flavors on big meaty perfectly cooked ribs. Now I DON'T like potato salad.

Long story short, this request wasn't fulfilled at first but they did change our seats in the end.\\n\\nFood - there was a film of grease in my glass of coke, I asked for a new glass.  We waited for about 20 minutes then the food was brought to the table.  I ordered pepper pork rice and my wife ordered extra pepper beef rice.  Food was okay, not amazing IMO.  My wife thought it was quite greasy.  \\n\\nFinal thoughts: food was okay doesn't really blow you away.  I would probably give it a 2-3 stars for FOOD ALONE.  0 for service considering it was more like a cafeteria style of serving plus they didn't address my request for switching my table initially.

We got here around 8:45 PM and was told that the wait was going to be two hours. Two hours! I've never had to wait that long for food, but since I was in Oregon and this place is highly reviewed, I decided to suck it up and wait. The nice thing was that they have a sister lounge across the street that you can hang out at while you wait. After much discussion about what we wanted to do for two hours, we ended up at Whiskey Soda Lounge. \\n\\nAt WSL you can actually order some of the menu items from pok pok. We got some drinks and ordered their famous fish sauce wings. When the wings came out, I couldn't help but dig in. They are like heaven on a bone. It was so nice that WSL serves this dish because it was a nice thing to enjoy before you get to eat at Pok pok. The wings were in this amazing sauce that is sweet and spicy. There is this crunch bits in the sauce that give the wings a nice crunch. These wings are like everyone says, purely AMAZING! \\n\\nSo after we devoured our wings, and emptied our drinks, waited for a another hour, the waitress at WSL told us that they were ready for us at pok pok. We were finally seated at pok pok at 10:30 PM. This has been the longest I've ever waited for food, but It was very much worth it. Once we were seated my boyfriend and I, noobs to Portland and pok pok, didn't know what to order, also, the menu is a bit overwhelming because the dishes are in thai and you have to read the descriptions of the food to know what you are ordering. My friend who lives in OR ordered what he knew was good. If you have a friend in OR, then have them help you because it can get overwhelming. The wings were very filling and BIG, so we only ordered two dishes and a side of sticky rice. We got the Neua Naam Tok and Muu Paa Kham Waan. The Neua Naam Tok was this flank steak salad that was amazing. It was in seasonings with fish sauce. The meat was perfectly seasoned and super tender and juicy. The Muu Paa kham Waa was very good. I don't like spicy food, and this dish is very spicy, but I enjoyed it tremendously. The flavors complement very well!\\n\\nTwo hours of wait time is totally worth the amazingness that is pok pok!

The last thing I recall was the papaya salad, which we tried with the marinated(fermented?) crab.

The first time, we ate there and the second time (with the pictures), we brought it home. Both times, the chicken was crispy but not especially moist like great fried cicken. I liked that the coating wasn't greasy. Places like KFC use a ton of MSG, a flavor enhancer that also makes food taste saltier. I suspect Lucy's doesn't use MSG because my fianc√© gets sick when he eats MSG and doesn't get sick when he eats Lucy's chicken. That may be why some are saying Lucy's chicken tastes bland or needs salt. It is good but not great chicken. The mashed potatoes include the skins and were a little gluey instead of creamy. The pearl gravy was extremely watery, and I could really taste the beer. My fianc√© really likes it, but I didn't. The smoked potato salad was desperately crying out for an acid, like vinegar or mustard. I could taste the smoke but not much else. I also wasn't impressed with the moon pie (the big brown circle on my plate). The other time I went there, we tried the macaroni and cheese, which was ok. I really liked the corn on the cob.  The restaurant needs better signage. It is easy to miss when coming down South Lamar. Inside, it is very clean and has a relaxed vibe. The biggest complaint I have is the price. It is $24 for 12 pieces of dark meat chicken, with no sides. That is way more expensive than other fried chicken places, and it isn't superior enough food to justify the much higher price."},{"name":"Falafel House","address":"7316 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love love love this place!

Last Wednesday I had a dreadful experience and was set to review (based on that experience) but decided to give it one more shot - which is rare for me.  It's hard for me to get past crappy service.  So here's yer 2 fer 1 review special based on my experiences last week.\\n\\nI had an appt. right around the corner from Com and had time to spare so I decided to have lunch here.  As I walk in, I notice two other women waiting for a host/hostess and a very full restaurant.  There was space at the bar though (with dirty dishes) so I waited to see if I could grab a spot.  The two ladies confirmed they were waiting for someone.\\n\\nFor about 7-8 minutes, we waited.  8 more people came in, 4 walked back out.  I still had a good 45 mins to spare and my stomach was starting to make its presence known so I waited.  Finally, a hostess came over and I was OK to go to the bar, even though there wasn't a clean spot to be had.  \\n\\nMe, the dirty dishes and someone's credit card receipt sat there for 15 minutes as 3 waiters ran around like chickens with their heads cut off.  No acknowledgement, water, menu - nothing.  At this point I knew I was not eating before my appt but wanted to see how long before ANYONE said a word.  I ended up flagging down a waiter and let him know I'd been sitting there for some time and asked if the kitchen was behind (I would take my bahn mi to go). The wait staff was behind, not the kitchen, he stated.  However, it could still take about 15 minutes.  Thanks, Chief.  \\n\\nAs I grab my stuff to go, the hostess magically appears again and notices me and realizes I'm getting up.  I asked if she was the manager (yes) and let her know the service was terrible and I'd been sitting there since she sat me.  She yelled something at the wait staff as I walked towards the door.  \\n\\nFast forward two days later, bahn mis were still on my brain and I didn't feel like driving over to BuHi. I decided to give them one more shot before reviewing.\\n\\nAs I walked in, I was promptly seated, given a menu and water.  100% better. Despite being prime lunch time, they were about half full (that quickly changed).  I decided on the lunch combo bahn mi + crab and asparagus soup.  Both were quite tasty, overall I was pleased with the food but there are far superior bahn mis to be had.\\n\\nMy gripe?  The combo is listed as $6 for a bahn mi, \\"stuffed with savory filling...topped with pickled daikon, carrots, cucumber, cilantro, tomatoes and jalapeno slices.\\" (Jalapeno was missing.)\\n\\n\\"Savory filling\\" being the key phrase here.  Any other place, you choose which meat you want and you're done.  At Com Dunwoody Grill?  You pay extra for the actual meat.  My shredded chicken was an additional $3.75.  WTF?  *insert kicking myself for not going to BuHi*  \\n\\nText should read: stuffed with savory filling that you pay extra for and topped with pickled daikon, carrots, cucumber, cilantro, tomatoes and jalapeno slices.\\n\\nI noticed on the \\"pho\\" menu, they are doing the same.  So you're telling me you would only get the broth or the veggie only bahn mi at the base price?  \\n\\nC'mon son!\\n\\nThey are getting over on Gringos in Dunwoody.  \\n\\n1 star for the bad experience, +1 star for the turn-around in service."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great service, quick wait on a Saturday for 2.

Torchys Tacos is a great establishment, but the William Cannon location is by far and away the WORST Torchys in existence to man. Let me explain why...\\n1. Taco size portions suck regularly. Bowls are barely 1/4 filled, tacos aren't even remotely full. I went to the Cedar Park location last night, and my bowl could barely stay sealed it was so full. I went to the Anderson Mill/620 location today, and my taco looked like a freaking behemoth compared to the fairy sized tacos over at Wm Cannon. This is entirely unacceptable. \\n2. 1/4 to 1/2 filled to-go sauces regularly. This is beyond infuriating. 1 sauce is enough when it's filled up...but it's a hassle to have to ask every. single. day. for 1-2 extra sauces depending on how skimpy they decided to fill them for the day.\\n3. 4 out of 5 times they forget to add the queso (trashy), but 5 out of 5 times they charge me for it. I get a specific taco that I only get because when it's trashy, it's truly elevated. I now have to pull out my taco, and inspect it each day before I can walk away with a to go order. It wouldn't be such a big deal, but this has been a constant struggle with them. And considering I pay extra for the queso, albeit like 30-40 cents, it adds up over time...especially when the frequency of visits is so high.  \\n4. Customer service is the worst here in Austin. I am at this Torchys location 4 out of 5 days a week on average. You would think that the 2 elderly hispanic ladies whom I've conversed with hundreds of times would know me by now. You think they would know my name. They look at me with the same cold, blank, dead, uninterested stare every time I come in. They never smile at customers, only amongst themselves. One of them has been around this Torchys since I moved down here from North Austin a couple years ago, and I'm pretty sure she's the one who consistently forgets to make my tacos trashy. Not only are these 2 ladies an issue, the high turnover rate here is ridiculous. There aren't many customer facing employees that last here very long, aside from the 2 ladies mentioned above. I think the -only- person who has ever remembered me, was the big white guy who looks like he hits the gym every day. That guy is cool and deserves a bit of a raise considering the team he's working with. \\n5. The phones don't work right here. I'd say once a week, I call up to this Torchys and the phone just doesn't ring. It just hangs up immediately. It's so bad, that I've continued to call them from leaving my house, to arriving at Torchys, and never once did the phone ring. I know it's not MY phone either, as I can call my gf and ask her to call Torchys for me...then she gets the same behavior from the phone system. \\n6. I mentioned all of this to the manager. I was promised my next meal would be comped, and that he would cancel my transaction for that day. The transaction was never cancelled, and when I came in next time, they charged me full price even after I mentioned the other manager said my meal was on him. \\n\\nIf this were my business, I'd fire almost everyone there and re-train a whole new staff. I now go to the South Lamar location, who has earned my daily business, even though it's entirely out of my way on my way to work."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped at Slappy Cakes during my trip to Portland and was not disappointed!

They were so very pleasant and very helpful, my boyfriend and I ordered our favorite main dish chicken pad Thai. I always appreciate when you can add spice to your dish at a Thai restaurant and you can do that here. In addition we had a Thai iced tea and a Thai iced coffee. Both were on point and delicious. I preferred the coffee over the tea, I felt the tea wasn't sweet enough for my personal preference, but that wasn't what I had ordered and my boyfriend enjoyed it very much. \\n\\nAside from our main dish, I had asked our server if we could get a side dish of rice covered in yellow curry. They offer curry rice dishes as mains and so I wasn't sure if they would allow me to order that, I've been to several places and asked for this where they have kindly said no, or they have agreed but then brought me a full meal size amount and charged me the full meal price as well - which I wouldn't have ordered if that was the case as I already had a meal and it was wasteful as well as disappointing. I always worry by asking for this special thing that might happen, but the people here are so very sweet. So the young boy said he would ask and then I was greeted by the young woman, who was also very kind and she listened to me until she knew exactly what I meant and she said it was no problem. They served that to us first, almost like an appetizer and it was the perfect starter to our delicious Pad Thai meal. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back soon, of the entire evening there wasn't one thing that wasn't wonderful and everything we ate was absolutely delicious.

I offered the suggestion of using butter to keep the meat moist if this was going to be their beef cut of choice. He told me they use beef from Cisco. (Cues Dungeon Music). He explained that he's never heard this before and they everyone says they have the best burgers in town!! (GASP) (They've obviously never had Yeah Burger, Killer Grindhouse, Chili's, The Brake Pad, or Burger King :) \\nHe asked if it was my first time. (I stared at him in awe.) He chalked my burger up to a bad day in the kitchen. (Drops Jaw) (Enter GASP here.) It's not the poor quality beef or the systematic cooking to well-done!! The bacon bits, or the service that makes me literally sick! Well then, it must be his first time managing! :) \\n\\nNightmare Over.

Downstairs area at the bar or at a table, the wall garden is sure yo be memorable. Cozy, dark, cool. Excellent beverages.\\n\\nWe tried the salted cod fritters with brandade and spicy cilantro Aioli. Crispy and salty, not too fishy. \\n\\nPuerto Rican pot roast with yucca gnocchi is a smashing success. Almost a tender pulled pork with sage and brown butter. Excellent gnocchi, tender and fluffy.\\n\\nAlbondigas soup - meatballs - arrive well seasoned and moist. The tomato based sauce is almost a soup, as it should be. Nice hints of mint in the meatballs. \\n\\nYucca stuffed shrimp were a tad dry but tasty. They are wrapped in bacon and served with a cilantro ginger dipping sauce to add some fatty sweetness to the crisp yucca. \\n\\nThe avocado roles with prune cilantro sauce present a wonderful vegetarian option that is anything but bland, wow! Good choice to go heavy with the prune and lighter with the cilantro since cilantro resides in so many spots around the menu. \\n\\nThis evening the ceviche consisted of orange salmon, lemon lobster and lime hake. The salmon and hake are to be heralded as extremely well balanced. Very fresh fish, good addition of sweet orange to a fatty salty salmon. Lobster had an overdose of cilantro, otherwise tender chunks were served. \\n\\nThe wild mushroom sauteed with white sweet potato slices proves equally great. \\n\\nThe sweet plantain and egg omelet with pink sauce is a source of Spanish pride - this traditional rendition was excellent. \\n\\nThe Margarita I drank consisted of picante y cilantro, El torso plat tequila, cointreau, jalapeno, cilantro and agave. An incredibly refreshing combination of sweet, salty and spicy while cooling at the same time. \\n\\nThe bartenders suggestion of Glendronach scotch concluded our festivities. Mind what you order, the bill can add up quickly. \\n\\nOverall, its so good, I've been back three times.

There are books about this place. Write ups as well. James Beard winner. Searching for what is popular, one quickly concluded: chicken wings, wild boar, half bird, you know, the popular and delicious cocktail drinks. But no one told me this is literately down the street by my HAPPIEST food pod on earth. The air streamers filled Tidbit Food and Garden on SE Division street. \\n\\nPok Pok is simply very amazing on its own accord, but it's possible that this restaurant's existence has created a groundswell of new and innovative shops. I had later stepped into Gypsy Chic and bought 5 dresses. And Bollywood Theatre and KOI fusion down the street served up very innovative cuisine. Flying Cat coffee shop and endless microbrews along the way. Not to mention there are some way better Good Vibration like shops for those who need additional pleasure. You are not going to want to go to Pok Pok to eat and leave, you want to arrive early or late and simply don't care if there is an hour or two wait, because you have plenty of places to go and browse before heading back to Pok Pok to get seated, for this strip of SE Division is a gold mine of unique finds. At the risk of overusing vibe as a verb yet again like every other hipster want-to-be, this place is vibing just right. \\n\\nThe entrance to Pok Pok reminded me of a nice restaurant in Thailand: while it's rustic, it's elegantly done. The outdoor patio area is quite enclosed and one could eat there comfortably as if one was inside. Though the inside counter by the bar seemed to be a better spot, if you could get your hands on it. There are also small counter spaces that have turned into eating space, very much like a street vendor in Thailand serving food in their small stalls. Sticky rice - according to the fine print, must be eaten with hands for it was super sticky. Noted and done correctly.\\n\\nWild boar is interesting because the mustard greens are on ice. Some brilliance there. Chicken wing is intense. Get those because everyone does. The vinegar soda drink was quite something else. Get the turmeric. I opted for the house coffee. Being that this is Portland, coffee absolutely does not disappoint. The half bird is a crowd pleaser. The chopped up lemon grass with silver noodles reminded me an exact version of it while i was in Thailand.\\n\\nMade to the bathroom twice just to see the James Beard award in the right bathroom. Note, it's the bathroom on the right, not left. I tried both.\\n\\nWhiskey bar down the street was closed at 12:30 PM after lunch. Darn it.\\n\\nTotally happy afterwards. Even happier for I knew the food scene in Portland has far exceeded my expectation. Second trip to Portland in two months. and i still have so many new restaurants to try. I have been quite satisfied with San Francisco and New York, though the new restaurants have ceased to wow me for they lacked originality. The only food scene that still excite me as of late are Sweden and Portland. \\n\\nPok Pok integrates new and old, In the end you get a true east meets west feel but it stands on its own like a brand new category. Call it fusion food does not do its justice. Its execution is flawless Thus I suspect the surge of cool restaurants nearby was partly inspired by Pok Pok.  \\n\\nIf you break it down a little further, you may find resemblance to some of the Scandinavia countries. For instance, every place has bike parking, good coffee, and free internet. Men and women in dark frame glasses and dressed in their local designer clothes. You may come to agree with me that Portland is very Reykjavik, with a bit of Stockholm thrown in. \\n\\nNow noodle on that, with curry beef broth, please."},{"name":"Vivo Austin","address":"6406 N I 35, Ste 2343","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The service was fantastic - the waiter rushed out our food when we told him we were in a hurry.

The food is presented beautifully and the buffet is kept immaculate, as is your table, because servers are everywhere cleaning and refilling your drink. The restaurant is spacious and everyone sits at tables. The only thing out of place are the big, hard, transparent plastic red cups your drinks are served in.

In any event, this time it had a flavorful blend of chopped red onions, tomato, and corn.  As well as a good amount of chicken.  Much better.  Also, the barista who prepared the sandwich this time very conspicuously washed his hands first.

All the BBQ beef accomplished was to piss off my hunger.  My partner encouraged me to try the Texas Hot, his favorite.  So went back up to the counter ordered and paid for a Texas Hot and a chocolate milk.  I bit into the Texas Hot and it tasted like the inside of a brand new Igloo Cooler, gross!  There was not enough chocolate milk in the world to wash it down.  I went to the counter and quietly told the attendant that there something definitely wrong with the Texas Hot kolaches.  She apologized, threw the whole tray away and asked, \\"...what else can I get you?  No additional questions were asked.  She replaced my nasty kolaches with all BBQ beef and I was very happy!  I totally forgot to mention to her the coffee was gross.  I suspect she would have thrown that out too."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.

I arrived an hour and 15 minutes early without a reservation but in need of a table for 6; the front of the house is really friendly and accommodating and was able to help us score a table pretty much at the right time. The restaurant decor is chic and clean with a really cool back wall made entirely of oyster shells.\\nWe started with a few appetizers. The oyster slider is a great 2-bite morsel contrasting the richness of the toasted brioche and batter-fried oyster with the acidity from the lime and cherry/grape tomato; my only issue is that there just simply is not enough oyster as a single oyster does not do justice to the accoutrements. The shishito peppers are not charred and maintain some of the freshness/crispness of the peppers that is usually lost whenever I've had shisitos elsewhere, which was great. The crabcake suffers a similar fate as the oyster slider: the cake itself simply doesn't have enough crab and so it takes a back seat to the vibrant flavors of the tomatoes (and vinaigrette?). The lobster roe noodles are very interesting: the noodles themselves are a lighter version of an egg fettuccine, and the mushrooms add a great umami flavor to the richness of the short rib which is a great contrast to the lightness of the noodles, but unfortunately my solid helping of lobster was somewhat overcooked. The $5 buttermilk biscuit is delicious: coated in honey, the crusty outer texture is a great foil to the inner pillowy goodness, it's simply missing a couple eggs, cheese, and a large slice of breakfast sausage. For dessert, the banoffee pie (banana+toffee, mind=blown) is a whipped cream lover's dream come true; however, the peach beignets are not fluffy the way real New Orleans beignets are, but instead are closer to thin-skinned (bordering on crispy) fried peach empanadas.\\nThe cocktails are pretty solid, and the bar staff is helpful and polite, but our server was unfortunately a little stiff and we weren't sure if he had just recently started. As a whole, I would give this place a 3.5 out of 5 as it's a great place to catch up with friends over a solid meal, but I look forward to coming back and trying some of the other dishes (including the raw bar) in search of other offerings like the biscuit that could help raise my overall impressions of this place to match the hype."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Visited for the first time this evening.

It went by quickly and we were seated around 6:30. \\n\\nWe ordered the wings and the cat fish noodle salad. Nothing particularly special about the salad, the noodles had a bit of a strange texture but the flavor was decent. I also got their Bloody Mary that was really really good. It has a very different albeit unique flavor than what you're typically used to because they used different Thai seasonings and spices - so yummy. Also disclaimer: I am usually not one to jump on the bandwagon when everyone is raving about some new food place (not that Pok Pok is that new anymore) but damn, my boyfriend and I really liked their wings. Like so much that we ordered another one to go. It was kind of ridiculous how much they cost, $15 for 6 wings and it's considered an appetizer but I seriously can't stop thinking about how yummy they were. I know some people said they were kinda salty and I could see why they thought that but the flavor was just so spot on that I didn't really think it was a problem. Plus I prefer my food to be a little saltier than too bland. Anyways, only tried those two food items so can't say much for the rest of the menu but I would definitely recommend the wings!"},{"name":"Freshii","address":"870 West Cordova St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I think my Feedback to Freshii says it all:\\nThinking I had just hit a bad day at the Cordova store location a few months ago, I have given it a few more chances. I am convinced this store is on a down slide. I have been a patron for years off and on, depending on where I have worked.  The last 4 months I have been about a block away but bad service has deterred me.  I buy my lunch every day.  That's about 250 work days at an average of $9 a day. Do the math.  \\n\\nRegular occurrence is nobody coming to the counter or looking out for customers while prepping food.  I have stood there sometimes for minutes wondering if they understand that the money customers pay go towards their wages.  I eventually say \\"excuse me\\" to which I am greeted with indifference, and a blank, emotionless face that implies I am interrupting something else much more important than serving a lowly customer.  \\n\\nToday was a triple-whammy.  Craving something healthy for breakfast, I reluctantly entered the store.  #1. Nobody even acknowledged I was there.  Normal,  no surprises there.  When someone did come to the counter, she just walked up to the counter and looked at me.  No \\"hello\\", no \\"can I help you\\" - just that irritated, I was doing something else look.  No words.   #2.  When she was making my order, someone else was doing food prep on the counter and a big plastic jug of something was in the way. She pushed it out of the way with her arm, then placed my wrap on the stainless steel where the bottom of the jug had just been.  I just about fainted.  The lady beside me looked at me and we exchanged \\"really?\\" glances.  Desperate to say something, I held back so not to embarrass her in front of the other waiting customers who looked impatient from waiting a long time.  \\n\\n2 other customers got served while I waited for my wrap to get grilled.  I read 6 pages of the news while waiting, noticing on the clock that that I was going to be late for an 8 am meeting and I had been there for 10 minutes already.  #3. A different girl went to check on the wrap and seemed to be wrapping it in paper.  Then she went the other direction.  The first girl came to me and said the wrap was ruined (hmmmmm burnt from neglect?) and asked if she should make another.  I said I was late for a meeting and that I'd just like my money back.  She refunded my money with little remorse. \\n\\nBeing a business person and having worked in food services in my younger years,  I am in utter disbelief that the QA on customer service is not closely monitored.  The indifferent, poor service and lack of Food Safe practices (I wonder if that jug was on the floor?) has turned me off Freshii forever.  There are too many choices out there and if I wanted to be treated the way I get treated when I go to the Cordova store, I'd just go over to my friend's house who has a 14 year old daughter who just gossips with her friends and ignores everybody else.  That's what it feels like when I go to Freshii.  My favourite time was when nobody was working - 3 girls huddled together talking as I stood stupidly at the counter thinking that they would want to serve a customer. One even made eye contact with me and continued to talk.  What is more important than the customer?  Thousands of business books will tell you.  Nothing.   Shame on you.\\n\\nBTW, 4 out of 5 of your lights are burnt out on the hanging lights in the front entrance.

Without asking, the waiter had all our dishes split (from the noodles, to the chowder and also the lobster roll) which was incredibly thoughtful of him. The chowder was fantastic and included a few mini bites of the buttermilk biscuit. The butter that came with the bread was sweet, we couldn't figure out what was in it but it was tasty. The salmon tartare tasted like poke.... but I love poke so I didn't mind. I'm also obsessed with house-made chips which did not disappoint.

Thankfully with his departure the Chef didn't roam far - opting to become chef and Co-owner at Luce in Powell.  Despite the fact that the menu lacked Rodriguez's unforgettable PB&J Foie Gras that is second only to Keller's masterpiece at the French Laundry in my masticatory memory, a single look at the inspired new-Italian menu definitely indicated Luce warranted a visit.\\n...\\nGiven appropriate time to browse the menu and with wine offered/declined and water glasses filled we were greeted by our friendly server, Tyler, who explained the tapas plates versus the large plates and also told us of the daily specials.  Wanting to experience as much of Luce as possible we each opted for an appetizer and a main plus I ordered a couple items extra to be shared around.\\n...\\nOrders placed we were first brought a loaf of house bread cut lengthwise and into strips.  A fan of unique bread presentations myself, I couldn't help but see my mom's smile when the house made and piping hot Italian Bread with Sundried Tomato compote in extra virgin olive oil was brought and she tasted her first bite - in her words \\"The Perfect Bread!\\"  Crusty on the outside with a pillow-soft interior the clean and aromatic bread was perfectly complemented by a light olive oil with plenty of punch provided by the tart compote.  While it may not have been perfect, I can definitely say it was the best house-bread I've taste in Columbus.\\n...\\nforest mushroom pizza with rosemary & garlic roasted portobello + crimini + shiitake + mozzarella cheese + tomato sauce + truffle oil - in a word, amazing.  Thin and crispy crust with plenty of body to hold up to the plethoric amount of cheese and fresh mushrooms, great accents of rosemary and garlic, sweet tomato sauce with a bit of bite - everything about this pizza just worked and the price for the quality and portion was better than anything on the menu at Marcella's or Figlio.\\n...\\nMeyer lemon shrimp raviolo with hericot verts, portobello and radicchio saute, roasted corn, white wine sauce and was clearly the show-stopper/spotlight stealer of the night.  Handmade pasta that was equal parts sweet lemon and savory shrimp mixed with creamy cheese were gently coated with a mildly acidic and aromatic sauce that peaked the flavors expertly on the tongue.  Anchoring the plate were snappy and fresh hericots, a m√©lange of earthy mushrooms and bitter radicchio, and sweet toasted corn that once again showed the chef's skill with marrying unlike tastes/textures into an complicated yet refined experience. \\n...\\noregano spiced chicken breast + sundried tomato-corn polenta cake + broccolini + smoked tomato-basil sauce.  Having experienced Chef's hand with chicken at BoMA and loving polenta in almost all forms the dish seemed like a can't miss - and it was.  Tender and succulent chicken breast with a coating of crispy oregano-laden cornmeal was presented perched atop a well-cooked polenta cake soaked in tomato basil sauce and topped heavily with tender and perfect broccolini as good as those that I had in California in February.  With the many different ingredients and their varying textures my favorite aspect of the dish was actually that no two bites were alike and given the sheer size of the dish I actually had some to take home for the following day.  Given the price/quality I can honestly say this is one of the best deals in the city.\\n...\\nthe aptly named s'mores with toasted vanilla meringue + amaretto chocolate mousse + white chocolate caramel.  Served in a martini glass and featuring a thick chocolate mousse with strong hints of amaretto pierced by a creamy vanilla meringue and ribboned with laters of smooth caramel and crushed graham crackers the dish was an absolute masterpiece and completely stole the show from my cake in presentation and flavor.  Digging from layer to layer, each bite provided a different degree of crunchy vs. smooth, chocolate vs. caramel, and mild vs. bold - without a doubt a candidate for best post-BoMA Columbus restaurant dessert.\\n...\\nWhen it was all said and done I will admit that I was not only satisfied but stuffed - clearly overordering we took home 2 full take-home containers (the first time I've taken home leftovers in at least 3 years) but I didn't regret a single choice outside of the cheeses which, ironically, I only complain about due to the small portion.  Like our visit to BoMA both the setting and the food were phenomenal and each dish showed great use of contrasts, complementation, and seasoning while maintaining roots in \\"traditional\\" cooking.  While Powell may seem \\"out of the way\\" to some, I will say without a doubt that the food is rivaled only by Rigsby's in the local Italian dining scene and the prices and portions at Luce are certainly more favorable."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Yummy oysters from Duxbury & Plymouth.

For food, we started with 2 small plates, the hushpuppies and the brussels and thoroughly enjoyed both. For main dishes we tried the bacon risotto, which from reading reviews might be their most popular dish (with good reason!), the Gnocchi with crab, and the scallops with kimchi. The bacon risotto and gnocchi were on another level. It's like they took the essence of bacon and infused it into a perfectly cooked risotto. The gnocchi was so tender and creamy and crabby and perfect. The scallops were also perfectly cooked, but I don't think I am a fan of kimchi, so that's my own fault. \\n\\nFinally we moved on to dessert and this is where things got weird. The cheesecake dessert was fabulous and perfect. We also ordered the White + Dark chocolate. When it came out, we were surprised by the appearance because there isn't a description. They use (I think) nitrogen to turn the white chocolate into a new form, it looked a little like popcorn but the texture melts in your mouth. My husband took a bite and said \\"huh this is really smokey\\", so I tried it and it tasted...off.I had a few more bites and remarked that I thought it tasted like bleu cheese. I didn't really enjoy the flavor but thought maybe they were going for a savory and sweet combination and while I usually enjoy that, this dish was missing the mark for me. 5 minutes or so later, the waitress came back and informed us they had mixed up the white chocolate foam with the bleu cheese foam on accident. She brought back a new dish with the correct foam and it was MUCH more enjoyable. Obviously accidents happen, but thats a flavor combination I won't soon forget. \\n\\nAfterwards, we went up to the cocktail lounge to have an after dinner drink. The lounge is GORGEOUS and is a place I will definitely be visiting more in the future...BUT we had a really uncomfortable incident because of the  placement of the tv's behind the pool table. The bar wasn't very crowded and we thought we would play a game while enjoying our drinks. A few other guests were watching the olympics and made some pretty rude comments to us about blocking the tv's. I calmly let them know that we were just trying to play a game of pool and if they had an issue with the tv location they should bring it up to the management. Things escalated from there, fueled by alcohol no doubt, and we ended up leaving before we were able to finish our drinks.\\n\\nTLDR: Most of the food was REALLY good, but some weird moments detracted from our overall experience."},{"name":"The Vancouver Fish Company","address":"1517 Anderson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Server was inefficiently, bringing one glass of water at a time, taking the drink order of one and not another.

The Chef, who clearly wasn't paying attention to food on his the buffet? Or was it patrons who, when Chef strolled through the dining room, smacked their lips and showered his staff with praise for the wonderful food?\\n\\nThe only reservation available was at 5:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving day.\\n\\nThis buffet may have been hot, fresh and toothsome when they set it out that morning. But, by the time we arrived, it was tepid -- and some \\"hot\\" dishes were cold.\\n\\nThis was not for a lack of help. Kitchen workers were in seen in abundance - mostly chatting up other staff members, not paying attention to the premium-priced food they were serving.\\n\\nThe salads looked and tasted like they'd been out all day. The salads were wilted, and picked over. After we went by the table, a kitchen staff member brought out a new relish tray.\\n\\nThe \\"hot\\" buffet might have been a object lesson used by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) illustrating what NOT to do.\\n\\nFDA: \\"Prepare food in small portions. Keep hot dishes  at 200¬∞ F to 250¬∞ F prior to serving.\\nMark: Their hot foods were all prepared in full-size chafer pans. Most of them looked like they'd been put out in the morning.\\n\\nThe vegetables, potatoes, stuffing were all cold by the time we got to the table. It made them uneatable.\\n\\nFDA: \\"Hot foods should be kept at an internal temperature of 140¬∞ F or warmer. Use a food thermometer to check. Serve or keep food hot in chafing dishes, slow cookers, and warming trays.\\"\\n\\nMark: After cajoling several food service workers to do so, one finally sighed, and got out a thermometer. Whipped potatoes: 120¬∞ - Stuffing: 135¬∞ - Green Bean Casserole in cream sauce: 130¬∞.\\n\\nOne of the food kitchen help shrugged his shoulders, another said their Sterno cans were too small. Others wanted to argue, saying that the food was \\"warm enough\\".\\n\\nTheir gravy was scalding hot - slathering in on cold food items warmed them up, a bit.\\n\\n\\nALL VEGETABLES UNDERCOOKED: \\nThe Braised Brussels Sprouts, green beans in the Casserole, and the sweet potatoes were all virtually uncooked, merely warmed.\\n\\n- Braising Brussels Sprouts changes the chemistry taking out the bitterness and breaks down the chewy leaves. These sprouts were chewy and just play raw.\\n\\n- The green beans were raw. Even in this age of al dente, I don't think anyone really wants to be served green beans that need to be cut with a steak knife.\\n\\n- The sweet potatoes looked good, under their foam of marshmallows - even thinly sliced, and sitting out all day, they were crunchy like apples.\\n\\n\\nCARVING STATION\\nEither the carver was given a large butter knife with which to cut portions - or he was inept, and untrained.\\n\\nAsking for turkey breast, he \\"carved\\" up a substantial rectangular block of meat. When I asked him to cut into slices before he put it on my plate, he seemed surprised and displeased. He managed to turn the block of breast into chunks, shreds and shards. But, the turkey was properly cooked, warm and tasted delicious.\\n\\nSweetie asked for a thin slice of Prime Rib: She got t two-inch thick slab of rare Prime. As much as she likes Prime, without steak knives at the table, she gave up after sawing through part of it.\\n\\nThe Cranberry Sauce and Horseradish Sauce bowls were empty. The carver hadn't noticed and seemed to be put out that we asked for it. With a sigh, the bowls were refilled.\\n\\nPATRONS ENJOY COLD FOOD\\nAgain, it blew our minds to see diners seated at tables around us complimenting Chef, as he glided through the dining room.\\n\\nSweetie and I felt a little odd for being the only patrons to complain - in fact argue with staff - about the cold and undercooked food.\\n\\nMoments after a man at an adjoining table heaped praise of the food preparation, we got up to leave. We were marveling at how bad this expensive dinner was prepared, and served. The lady sitting at that table spoke up and agreed. \\"The vegetables were uncooked, and the all of the hot food was cold!\\" she said.\\n\\nIt was clear to us that Chef hadn't tasted the food as it left the kitchen - or he's on a raw food diet of some kind. The food was prepared in full-size trays, and wasn't switched out at least every two hours, per FDA guidelines.\\n\\nWe had to surmise that folks in Beaverton enjoy poorly prepared food, served and dangerously cool temperatures.\\n\\nOn the up side, we didn't get food poisoning!\\n\\nWe won't be back.

I ordered a bagel and cream cheese for the kiddo, untoasted. It should've been toasted. It was a bit stale, so she wouldn't eat it. I ate half but couldn't eat the other. Then got a cookie - a Monster Cookie - to tide my daughter over to lunch.  She ate half and said it was okay. I thought I would eat the other half but it, too, was stale, so I didn't finish it. So I guess I am saying go for the coffee, but maybe eat before or after (or have something more delicious waiting for you in the car if you take your coffee to go).\\nOh, and atmosphere - it seemed clean but felt a little cramped, especially to get to where you order.

Up until yesterday, Kendall Square was a bit of a food desert. You had to get on the T and cross the river just to get the most basic locally sourced produce. Well, friends, that was the day before yesterday. Now, I'm happy to report, you have Commonwealth Cambridge instead. \\n\\nNo more crossing the river and walking a block just to get decent milk and a small package (!) of eggs. No more wishing that you could get hot food, fast,  without a \\"DD\\" logo on the bag. No more wondering - as I'm sure you have - how much better your food could have tasted if it was fresh from the farm. For all these needs, and more, Steve \\"Nookie\\" Postal (former Executive Chef at our own Fenway Park) brings you Commonwealth. \\n\\nAs a restaurant, Commonwealth offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner, either in made-to-order or grab-and-go varieties. You can get something small for yourself (particularly at breakfast), or enjoy a family-style meal. There's a rotating menu of meals featured each day. And don't worry, even the grab-and-go stuff is hot when you come in and doesn't taste like it fell on the floor before it was put in your hand. My preference is made-to-order, though, because it gives you an opportunity to experience the rest of what Commonwealth has to offer.\\n\\nFirst, there is the coffee and cappuccino. In true Cambridge fashion, this restaurant and grocer is also a coffee shop. I haven't sampled it yet, but I'm sure someone will very soon. Second, there is the grocery, featuring house-made or locally-sourced dry and dairy good on the shelves and in the cold cases. I my very brief visit I saw milk, ice cream, yogurt, pasta, jam, the aforementioned eggs (bless you, small packages), cheese, and pastries. Third, there is the seating area for the restaurant. Take it from me - a man who spent a year of weekends working on a cattle ranch and in feed store - you won't get more a authentic \\"farm\\" aesthetic in a comfortable environment without at least seven hound dogs under the table or a mule looking in the window. Fourth, there is the bar. As explained on their website, it serves beer, wine, and cocktails. I went in for breakfast, so it was just a tad early for me to start boozing, but a future reviewer will certain enlighten us. \\n\\nThat is it say, there are many reasons why you should be excited about Commonwealth. At least as excited as I was. I am happy to tell you that based on my first visit I will certainly be back. Even the staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.

You owe it to yourself!! \\n\\nWe walked into this place on a busy Friday night and were expecting to have to wait a long time for a table. 5 minutes later we were comfortably seated and ordered drinks. My husband and I each ordered a specialty cocktail - he got something gin-based and I got a lemonadey, mojitoey concoction that was really tasty (although I wish the mint hadn't kept going up my straw... I didn't really want to EAT my drink!) \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the half chicken with Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce with a side of Mac & Cheese. I think I was full about halfway through but I polished off every bite. It was absolute heaven... one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband had the chicken fried steak and I thought his jaw would never come off the floor when he saw it delivered. A humongous piece of tender, tasty steak covered in chicken batter and gravy.... I don't think he spoke until he stopped eating because he was so engrossed in it. Even the veggies they served on the side had perfect flavor, seasonings and cooked-ness. I tend to dislike the standard \\"veggies\\" side dish because it's either bland, raw, overcooked or some combination of those things. But I ate all my vegetables in addition to the chicken and mac & cheese!!! \\n\\nThe corn bread with jalapenos was a nice side dish, too, although I was so focused on my meal I barely touched it.

So we came here for a friend's birthday party. We are party of 15 people on a Tuesday night. For a Tuesday night they are not that busy. We made the reservation beforehand and on the day of the event the owner said that for a party of 8 or more you have to order from the set menu. Menu A was the cheapest and of course we went with it for $28 per person +5% tax +15% gratuity.

We did not get any service but we had to pay 15% gratuity when my glass was always empty. There was only one waitress serving the whole restaurant. The owner just stood there and watch. I find that this restaurant is ridiculous. \\n\\nI have to say their pad thai was smaller then any thai restaurant I have ever been to. from the plate of pad thai it was not even enough for 1 person how can you share amongst 5. Everyone came out hungry.\\n\\nI know business is tough but if you start scamming people words spread and its starting to show. PLEASE stay away from this dishonest restaurant.\\n\\nHi Tej:\\n\\nThank-you for acknowledging that you only emailed the menu to one person. May I ask why was the menu not printed and disclosed to all patron at the start of the meal and may I ask why did you communicate to all guests? According to Canadian Contract law all contracts/special menu in your case must be disclosed to all paying patrons (as you a restaurant is considered a public area by law must also be aware of this legal issue). I understand that you came up with the menu last minute as you said on the day of the event for that reason why it was not posted in the menu to public. But you could have went to a photocopier shop to print out 15 copies but you decided not to and as well, you did not verbally communicated to each guest. \\n\\nI hope you understand why other restaurant that come up with special menu also reprint a copy. As this is a contractual binding agreement with each guest. I know you are going to argue that you were not sure who is the paying guest. You should have asked who is the paying patron if you are unsure then again should have posted the menu in public or give each guest a copy of the menu. As in your case. you did not. Its ok to even raise the price within 5 mins before a customer comes in but like I said this should have been disclosed either verbally or written to all paying guest (in your case you have only communicated to one guest). As you should be aware the contract is binding with all paying guest not just the person whom you sent the email. It is true that discrimination price is legal and is practice but this is beyond discriminatory pricing. Have I answered your question on why my review is the way it is? We still payed because we didn't want to argue at that time."},{"name":"Vittles Restaurant","address":"2579 S Cobb Dr SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"Good, down home style breakfast.

Atmosphere is perfect for a romantic night out, and servers are great as well.\\n\\nWe (luckily) tried a lot of dishes, so here we go:\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n1. Seven Layer Salad- ridiculously good salad w/ just enough sauce to complement the different veggies that came with it. 10/10\\n2.

Not sickeningly sweet like other puddings I've tried before, and the chocolate was more on the dark side, which is always good in my book. 9/10\\n\\nWe also got to try an assortment of their wines and cocktails, and while they're all good, I'd recommend their cocktails more, especially the Raulito."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite place for pasta.

There are some pretty great things about this place but I'm just not the biggest fan.\\n\\nMad Mex is located right on campus in the South Campus Gateway. So it's always full of students. They also have student specials if you show them your Buck ID at certain hours of the day. But there are some pretty awesome deals even if you aren't a student.\\n\\nIf you aren't in the area to walk to Mad Mex, your best bet for parking is to use the Gateway parking garage. It's really cheap. There are a few metered spaces out front on the street but they are usually full and you'd have to be lucky to nab a spot. Mad Mex is right out by the street and Ugly Tuna Saloona is right above it.\\n\\nIt looks really neat in here; I love the decor. Some of the southwestern cartoonish characters scare me, but the designs are really cool. There are some awesome lights hanging all over the place, but they are more for looks - it kind of dark in here. Everything has a rustic yet somehow modern southwestern look and things are all kinds of bright colors. The walls are painted with the weird characters - even in the bathrooms! It's an interesting place to look at. And the menus are really neat. The cover is made of leather and the descriptions of the meals can be really funny. I've actually found myself reading through all of them on occasion just for laughs.\\n\\nWhat I absolutely love about Mad Mex is that the food is half off after 10pm. That is such a great deal. Of course, it's not all the food. I think it excludes the Chimichangas, desserts, tacos, fajitas, stuff like that. But most of the menu is half off. It's a great way to eat cheap late at night while avoiding fast food. And the serving sizes here are kind of big, so it really is a great deal for the money.\\n\\nWe ate at Mad Mex last night. We had just come from the Newport after a show and needed a late dinner. So we parked at the parking garage and went in. There was a pretty good crowd for a Monday night, no doubt people there for the after 10 specials. Our hostess greeted us and gave us a booth.\\n\\nWe got our menus and all decided on an appetizer - nachos with chicken! We figured that we might as well since it was half off! The nachos were really good. They were topped with sour cream, guacamole, beans, pico de gallo and jalapenos! We all devoured them. It was quite tasty. But before we could even finish them our food was already out! The service was really quick.\\n\\nI got the San Francisco wings. The sauce was a mix of honey and red pepper. It was sort of spicy and really good. I like Mad Mex's wings. They aren't really all that meaty, but they taste really good and are good quality chicken. I would have liked it if the sauce was a little spicier, but it was still good. And I got the large wings plate which has 14 wings. More than enough, but it was originally $9.5. Which isn't bad, but when you think about it being half price, $4.75 is awesome for that many wings!\\n\\nMy sister got a salad and it was pretty big, but she was able to eat the whole thing and enjoy some of the nachos. Her husband and my boyfriend each got burritos, which were huge! They were both able to eat them all, but they also really liked them. I know my boyfriend got the Chicken Mole Burrito, and he said it was very satisfying. He really liked the mole sauce. My brother-in-law had the Spicy Mad Mex Burrito and he said that it could have been spicier, but still enjoyed it. All in all, we were pretty happy with our food.\\n\\nSo why did I only give it three stars? Because aside from the wings, I don't like the food here very much. I've been here many times and have tried lots of things on the menu and just haven't been impressed. I think the burritos and tacos are quite bland compared to most other Mexican places I've been to and sometimes I just don't like the taste. Now that I've discovered the wings I stick to those, but I wish I could enjoy other things on the menu. I don't really like just ordering wings at a Mexican place all the time.\\n\\nWhenever I come here I have to get a margarita. They are pretty good here, but sometimes they are too strong. You can really taste the tequila at first, but after a little while I get used to it. They come in all kinds of flavors: lime, strawberry, mango, raspberry, kiwi. I feel like I'm forgetting one, but you get the idea. Last night we got the strawberry and it was really good. I think that one is my favorite. My sister got the raspberry and it was a bit too tart. I've had the mango, but it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. I wasn't a huge fan of the kiwi, either. But I do like these margaritas because they are strong. I don't really like how you can taste the tequila, but other than that they are pretty good. But they can get expensive. The big ones were $6 last night, but that's only cheap if you have one. But they are cold and slushy and good. I guess they're not too expensive if the food is half off!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Meh.\\n\\nWent there after reading the brunch review on Yelp.\\n\\nFind somewhere else for brunch.  I was staying at the Courtyard two blocks away.  It was a huge pain to retrieve my car from the lot, and I didn't know anywhere else to eat brunch in Austin.  The fact that I could walk to the place sealed the deal for me.\\n\\nHad I known then what I know now I'd have retrieved the car and found some place else.\\n\\nIt's not that the food was awful--it wasn't.  It just wasn't anything special.  And it's not that the wait was terrible.  I got there at 10:00 (when they open) to find out people had started lining up at 9:30 and the wait was now 90 minutes.  I sat at the bar instantly (I was alone, so this wasn't a problem), so no wait.  And it's not that the mimosas were terrible--they were okay.\\n\\nBut it was pricey for the quality--the food was just average.  Nothing to get excited about.  Several scrambled egg dishes, tired-looking pancakes (at 10:10--when did they make them?), grits.\\n\\nThe killer was the crowd.  Jammed.  Bumping off people to get to and from my seat at the bar.\\n\\nAll-in-all, for brunch I wouldn't brave the crowd and the tab for the food there.  Just not worth it.  Austin must have someplace better, even if you are staying right next door.\\n\\nAs (lack of) luck would have it, my group had reservations there that night for dinner.  So I ate dinner there as well.  The food was again not bad.  Actually, the food was much better than brunch, but that's more a reflection of how mediocre it was at brunch.\\n\\nWe tried all the appetizers they offer.  The corn-dog shrimp someone raved about?  Skip them.  Again, not terrible, but there's a reason this idea isn't sweeping the nation.  The potato chips were iffy, but it's hard to make house-made potato chips.  I'd try them just to experience hot fresh potato chips, if you've never had some.\\n\\nThe battered asparagus was decent.  The spinach fondue was decent.  The pizza was decent.  Skip the other appetizers.\\n\\nI ordered the broiled trout for an entree and the green chile macaroni since someone raved about it on here.\\n\\nThe trout was very very good.  Get it if you're there.  The chile macaroni?  Meh.  Not awful.  Don't get the raving though.\\n\\nTried the meatloaf, salmon, flat iron steak, pork chop, and stroganoff as well.  All but the steak were at least good.  The steak was iffy.\\n\\nNone of them (except maybe the trout) rated the price.\\n\\nOf the desserts, the bread pudding was the best.  The apple pie was worth ordering.  Skip the rest.\\n\\nThe building is very interesting (historical), the service was acceptable.

I can't wait to try everything on the menu!  \\n\\nWe started with artichoke dip -- very creamy and tasty with a hint of jalape√±o kick. I then had the quiche of the day. As a vegan for 3 years (vegetarian for 12 years before that), it's been a long time since I've had quiche. This did not disappoint and the texture actually made it hard to believe it wasn't made with real eggs. Pac-man salad for a side dish was great and, how cute, the carrots were shaped like Pac-man. The jalape√±o cornbread was delicious. Yes, a little dry as vegan baked goods are wont to be, but the vegan butter on the side made up for it. My vegetarian-but-not-adventurous teen daughter had the Caesar salad. Even though it also had a little kick to it (and she doesn't like spice), she inhaled it. I must say it was a but tangy but it worked. We finished with mint chocolate chip (coconut-based) ice cream. Very minty, very good. \\n\\nMy true rating is 4.5 stars because of service but I'm rounding up to 5 since it is a vegan restaurant. Actually, the service started out really, really well and I was impressed. But we asked for the check and ice cream to go and it was about 7 minutes before we saw anyone again. At that point, ice cream was brought out, clearly not in a to-go dish. That was swapped out but the ice-cream was finished before the check was received and closed out, another 10 minute process. \\n\\nThat little snag aside, it was a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back and enjoy the rest of the menu."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Great selection of food!

Also they are little unconventional on how they charge for toddlers. Once your child is over 12 months old, they charge by height.

In otherwords, I dug it!\\n\\nOur waitress was super attentive and very friendly, even complemented my date's shoes (and yep, she got a 20% tip, haha)! We were starving, so we ordered two appetizers and three sandwiches (like I said, S-T-A-R-V-I-N-G!). The appetizers were terrific, I favored the Spicy Baked Artichoke Dip (I loved the creamy texture, and I'm not a huge artichoke fan, so that's saying something), which was JUST spicy enough, very flavorful and yummy; my date favored the Raw Bruschetta, which was out of this world. Onto the sandwiches: the Tempeh Reuben, the Sausage & Sauerkraut, and Jackfruit BBQ. ALL were delicious, my favorite though was the Sausauge and Sauerkraut. My date couldn't decide, she loved them all. I really want to try the Meltdown next, sounds great! We left STUFFED and satisfied, a fine meal, and a great experience all around.\\n\\nAll in all, a wonderful dining experience, cool free tunes, super friendly folks, and most importantly, great food!

I ordered the boneless honey mustard flavor both times and thought it was amazing. The chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Tonight I decided to try their traditional bone wings and wanted to order takeout. They said they closed at 2am, but when I arrived I was told they deliver until 2am only and close at midnight for dine in/takeout. I noticed three other parties who came thinking the same-- this should be fixed on their site. So, I decided to just order from the car and have them delivery at the UPS store next door. They ended up charging us the delivery fee of $2.50, which I thought was absurd considering they only needed to walk a few steps to delivery our order. In addition, they forgot the waffle fries that I ordered so I had to drive back. I ordered the garlic parmesan and hot garlic. However, they messed up my order a second time and gave me buffalo instead of the hot garlic. Overall, I was not satisfied with my meal and will probably not come back. I'll just stick to Buffalo Wild Wings because they have a good deal on Tuesdays -- at least the workers at Wings Over were nice."},{"name":"Maple Street Biscuit Company - Oviedo","address":"978 City Plaza Way","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"Play this place is the BEST all the way around .

Now I'm not so sure. I think the sign may actually be true.\\n\\nThe thing about Rudy's is that it's very visible and accessible. And lots of people think it's great because they truly aren't aware that you can get a much higher standard of barbecue at many places, mostly outside the city limits. Seriously, Texas Monthly does a top 50 in the state every few years and Rudy's won't even come close to making it. Nor should it.\\n\\nIt's edible, but once you learn what else is out there, you'll never want to come back. \\"Moist\\" brisket should not have rubbery spider webs of fat in it. That means it was cooked too hot and the fat didn't render properly. It takes the flavor out with it. But that's very much in keeping with what Rudy's is all about. It's like the fast food version of a cuisine style that is, by nature, all about patience and TLC.\\n\\nThis place has tasty sauce, but those who know Texas barbecue should be aware that sauce isn't a native part of the tradition; many of the best places don't offer it, or offer it only as an afterthought to please outsiders who have a different definition of \\"barbecue.\\" Without the sauce, the meat is rather bland, which pretty much defeats the purpose of eating at a Texas BBQ joint.\\n\\nThe best thing on the menu, IMO, is the creamed corn.

One of the Yelp reviewers, Gabrielle C (C is for Colton-Two Yelp reviews written on 6/4/14), is an employee! The owners have a history of lacking ethics.

To be clear: Pon gets great reviews from other people, probably people with other expectations of Thai food, and other budgets.\\n\\nAt Pon, I had the Tom Kha soup, one of my favorites, a coconut milk broth mushroom soup. I think that if you come here and don't want to spend much this is what you should get. For $8, I was really happy. It was a little less flavorful than some of the other Tom Kha soups I have had, but it was creamy and solid.\\n\\nMy mother had a papaya salad, which she ate without remark.

The food was absolutely wonderful - my group of five had several of the appetizers, including the tuna tartare, the foie gras, the grilled octopus, and the raw scallops. All of these were absolutely delicious, though fairly small. We also all enjoyed of our entrees - I had the gnocchi and my coworkers all had different types of fish (monkfish and cod, I believe). We all loved the food. In addition, we shared the chocolate mousse, the beignets, and the chocolate and calvados souffles for dessert, and everything was delicious and well-cooked. \\n\\nHowever, the service at this place was disappointingly awful. \\n\\nFirst, we had a reservation but arrived late. They told us there would be a wait for seating, which we felt was reasonable given our lateness. However, when we were taken upstairs, we noticed that there were several empty tables, and we hadn't seen anybody leave the restaurant while we waited. I'm not sure if they just were annoyed at us for arriving late, but we had to wait another fifteen minutes to be seated in a mostly empty dining room. The hostess was also fairly rude.\\n\\nAfter we were seated, a waiter eventually came over and asked about ordering. First, we ordered a very expensive bottle of wine. When they came out with the bottle and began to open it, it was clear that it hadn't been stored properly, as the server crumbled the very cry cork while trying to open the bottle and took about five more minutes to get the cork out. The wine was still very good, but it seems unprofessional to me for a nice restaurant to not store their wine properly, especially for such an expensive bottle. \\n\\nThen, we began ordering food. A member of our party hadn't yet arrived, so we first only wanted to order appetizers and save our entree orders for later. The waiter acted very weird about this and seemed annoyed with us. We ordered about 6 appetizers for the table, and he kept putting up his finger to stop us during our ordering (which felt awkwardly rude to me), and he commented on the fact that it was a lot of food in a sort of disparaging way. He also never brought us bread (which every other table had). The appetizers were fairly small, so it definitely didn't end up being too much food for our party of five.\\n\\nHe then took drink orders. One of my colleagues ordered a cocktail, and after waiting for it for about ten minutes checked in with the waiter about its status. The waiter said \\"it's right on its way!\\" Then two minutes later, the waiter came back and asked what drink my colleague had ordered, naming a drink that he had not ordered. Clearly the drink hadn't actually been \\"right on its way\\". It took a few more minutes then finally came out. \\n\\nThe evening continued in an odd manner. The waiter was a bit overly talkative and would jump in on our conversations in an awkward way, always sort of sneaking up behind people without us realizing he was there. I definitely don't mind friendly waiters who occasionally chat with their guests, but this one was honestly a bit weird and awkward. Service was slow, and the waitstaff didn't often check in on us regarding water, ordering the next course, etc., so the meal took a long time. \\n\\nOverall, I am tempted to go back for the food, but I probably won't, because the rude / slow / weird service has turned me off."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've been told that this place is a must try when in Portland, after reading great reviews I was so excited to finally try this place.

My bf thought otherwise. \\n- chicken wings: was super excited for this cause my brother raved about them. It was way too salty for us, the flavor is good but I don't get the hype. \\n- boar collar meat: I was a little hesitant to try this since I've never had boar before.

So how it works here is you order what you want at the cash register and pay right then before you get your food. And when the food is ready they'll call your order and you come up and grab your plate off the counter. It's a seat yourself type of place. \\n\\nI arrived with my family right before the dinner rush began. The owner and a friendly young man were working the two cash registers. The owner happened to ring me up. The owner was also expediting the dishes out onto the counter and calling out the orders. And if you didn't get to the counter in 1.37 secs when he called out your order (mind you this is a really small place) he would literally yell at you in front of everyone for being too slow. This poor man with his whole family sitting next to us got berated by the owner for not instantaneously teleporting to the counter in time. \\"LISTEN TO YOUR ORDERS PEOPLE!\\" \\"YOU'RE HOLDING EVERYONE UP!\\" \\"COME ON, LISTEN!\\"  Damn, do I need to be Usain Bolt in order to not be screamed at tonight?\\n\\nOhhhoho that's not even the worst part.

After insisting several times that I knew what I ordered and it was not that tree-ridden monstrosity, still being very polite, he STILL would not take the plate back and make what I ordered.

It'll take awhile to make what you want.\\"\\n\\nREALLY??? Are you really trying to force me to eat something I did not ask or pay for?!  This man clearly has no clue on what customer service is.

However, at 7:30, it did get quite a bit louder, but not bad enough to cause a problem.  The service may not be as \\"butt-kissing\\" as you might be accustomed to at this level of steakhouse, but it's really not necessary.  The staff is friendly and competent, which is enough for me.  Our server took plenty of time to describe the menu and make suggestions, so we were satisfied in that department.\\n\\nThe food ... awesome.  I had one of the daily specials, a peppercorn crusted filet of bison served with a root vegetable pie along with the beet salad.  My wife had a beef filet and oysters.  We both loved our food, the steak was fantastic.  We also had their mojo rock shrimp appetizer, a great choice along with the creamed jalepeno corn.  This is where Rathbun put Bones to shame.  Unlike bones, the steaks were not swimming in butter and the sides were artfully prepared, not vegetables thrown into a microwave and served completely plain.  Bones is not bad at all but Kevin Rathbun Steak does a much better job with food.\\n\\nAtmosphere is very interesting.  In one sense it's very spartan but still elegant without being stuffy.  As others have noted it's quite dark and servers will sometime provide flashlights to read the menu, but to me that's not too big a deal.

I do this because, no matter its faults, Powell's helps to promote a culture of literacy in Portland and gives us recognition nationally as a city of readers.  In this age of increasing dumbed-downedness, that alone is sufficient reason.\\n\\nI remember when you could get books really cheap at Powell's, and now the savings just aren't what they used to be.  So that's a drag; still, you can find good discounts if you look hard enough.  And there really is such an abundance of material there that I can't bring myself to deride the place just for trying to keep profitable.\\n\\nI also miss the time when you could go in there and it would be quiet.  When you could peruse books without having to hear all the same inane chatter as in the outside world.  Now it's a social meeting place and a fun shopping excursion just like the stupid Saturday Market.\\n\\nIt would also be nice if the philosophy section were not cruelly situated in between the two bathrooms.  Nothing quite like perusing through a stack of Deweyan pragmatism only to be nearly shoved aside every fifteen seconds by people in a hurry to piss.  Couldn't they just put all the Ann Coulter books there instead?  Just kidding, sort of.\\n\\nAnd I hate to say it, but it would be nice if you didn't have to hear Powell's employees bitching about work around every corner.  Trust me kids, until you're published yourselves this is about what your English major delivers.  I hear there are a number of fine teaching programs in town, then you can have that union you've always wanted.  Snarkery aside, there are some very knowledgeable employees there and when pressed into service they are typically quite helpful.  \\n\\nSome sections could use improvement.  The economics section is fairly short-stocked (is it an irony of supply and demand that there is little reader interest in economics?), and the sociology section falls woefully short of what it could be.  The history section is so dusty I'm afraid the dust will form an independent lifeform and threaten the city one day.\\n\\nMuch props, though, to their science fiction, literary criticism, and classical studies sections.\\n\\nI would like it, also, if they would charge a nominal price to see some of their speakers.  Maybe they do this anyway...all I know is that when Slavov Zijek came there to speak (it was free), the room was packed with an hour to go and I couldn't get in.  Would it kill them to attach a market string to the event and see who wants in bad enough to pay, say, two dollars?\\n\\nAll in all, there's really no point in reviewing Powell's.

Because the author of the blog seemed very confident in their ability to handle dietary restrictions, I wasn't overly prescriptive about my order, other than saying I couldn't have the bun because I was allergic (I think they may have gluten-free buns, but I can't handle egg or dairy either so didn't want to bother about it).  The man behind the counter asked if I wanted fries and assured me, without prompting, that they were gluten-free.\\n\\nThe person behind me in line was the mother of a child with food allergies.  The man behind the counter patiently went through the menu with her, explaining what her child could and couldn't eat.  He seemed very knowledgeable about ingredients, and I was touched by the time he took making her feel confident about her child's meal.  As a result, I probably felt more confident eating at Moderne Burger than I have at any restaurant in a very long time.  The confidence was well-placed...I didn't have a single allergic symptom following my meal.\\n\\nThe reason I think Moderne probably deserves just four stars was the actual food quality.  My husband enjoyed his burger (with cheese and a bun) but, with just lettuce and tomato, mine was a little dry.  We both ordered fries but would have had plenty in a single order.  Maybe not as many as, say, at Five Guys, but a lot of fries nonetheless.  I love french fries and don't mind them a little greasy, but these were over-the-top dripping with oil.  It's hard for me to complain since it's so rare that I can safely eat fries anywhere, but I did have to blot mine with a stack of napkins to eat them. \\n\\nIn conclusion, Moderne Burger is heavenly for those of us who need a little extra dietary care---and the place is cute enough (and food good enough) that your more omnivorous friends and family won't mind tagging along!"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Oysters were amazing.

At the thai temple in LA, similar papaya salad will run you about $3.  The drinks I thought were really good as well.  Naam Menao was nice and refreshing.  The Thai Basil Vinegar was an awesome drink.  Top notch.  I did think the fish sauce wings were way overrated.  I wouldn't order them again.  Nothing against them, just not my flavor profile.

My man was excited because he recognized this spot from a documentary he watched (Munchies). The specialty here is supposed to be the whole chicken and WE actually did have to wait a little longer because they were out BUT it was not the best or most favored out of all of the orders. Everyone seemed to agree the best thing on the menu that we ordered was the khao soi. The next best thing would be the khang hang leh. So much goodness and flavor in both! I personally didn't go crazy over the fish sauce wings, don't get me wrong they were good but I wish the spicy was A LOT spicier. We ended up taking the extra home and blessed a homeless dude with the leftovers before we took off on our flight. We ordered the tilapia on the specials menu which was pretty good and flavorful compared to your basic fried fish. The sausage was just okay, it was funny to us that the waiter explained how to eat it with your hands (he's talking to Filipinos here). The sticky rice was hella dry and I wish the coconut rice had more flavor, it tasted like regular white rice I had to actually smell it to make sure we ordered the right thing. The kung op won wen looked and sounded bomb but it was also pretty dry and disappointing for me because I requested it BUT we dipped it in some of the sauces that were given to us (I think it was one that came with the sausage) and it was HELLA better, the wings also taste good dipped in that sauce too. The Thai tea came in their own branded bottles which some thought were cool. \\n\\nI would come back and try other things on the menu ON TOP of the khao soi but I do not see myself ordering anything else we tried that day.

I think they are in a great location which adds to their success and business. It is a small restaurant and gets crowded, fast. I suggest to get there early and avoid large groups. A party of 2 gets seated much quicker. It's a small space so be prepared to walk between all the tables. \\n\\nFood:\\n\\nXe Lua: The boyfriend always get this, he can eat! The broth is good and it's a typical pho dish. It's good with all of the meats. Get this if you're hungry. \\n\\nBun Bo Hue: I sometimes crave this and tried it once. I think it was an off day because it was not that great. The meat was not tender as it should be, the soup was alright, not that flavorful as it should be too. I would not order this again because there are other better dishes they serve. \\n\\nBun Thit Nuong with beef. Beef was thin, marinated right, and just tasty. I like the vegetables mixed all in it. Add the fish sauce to eat. I also add some chili to the fish sauce because I like spice. Mix it well and add the fish sauce slowly. People usually dump the whole small bowl in it and ask for more. You actually do not really need all of it, unless you like salt. But it'll soak and the taste will be there, just be patient! \\n\\nTom Yum Noodle Soup: I was craving tom yum soup.

Nice and spicy, just the way I like it! \\n\\nPanang Curry: I absolutely love curry, and therefore have high expectations for it. They did a pretty good job with the Panang curry. It's a sweeter light one. I like the mix of vegetables. Chicken was good and moist. I sometimes don't like the chicken because it is overcooked and dried, but it was pretty good. It is also a very large serving. The rice is also a large serving. I would recommend maybe ordering this to go because they give more curry sauce, if you like it. (The boyfriend ordered this and had lots of extra curry sauce). \\n\\nJungle Curry: This was absolutely delicious!!! I ordered it way too spicy, but it was still so good. It's red curry, but this curry does not use coconut milk. I like the mix of meats and the sauce is just so good. Don't order it too spicy, unless you like it.

But somehow I managed to get a little taste of haute couture Bay Area style dining here. Why do I say this?\\n\\nPok Pok is probably one of the most swank establishments I set foot in the PDX. While it does look like a open-air Thai eatery on the outside, but walk inside and you'll find yourself in a bustling, dimly-lit atmosphere that made me think that. Kinda reminds me of Osha back in SF. \\n\\nMe and another friend who made the trek for Pedalpalooza rode up, locked our bikes up and made way to the podium. The hostess took our names, told us we can wait at their sister Whiskey Soda Lounge and they'll give us a call. So we went to WSL, I had a gin cocktail and she had a drinking vinegar. I ordered the \\"Chicken Three Ways\\" which was a mix of peanuts, lemongrass and shallots. Just to whet my appetite and dull down the booze a little. Our names were called and we make our way back to Pok Pok. \\n\\nOnce inside and seated, we look at the menu and I'm sorry but it's the Asian in me that was a little stumped about why doesn't rice come on the side. I ordered the back back ribs, she ordered the pork belly. And lots of rice please! When we got our food, my partner enjoyed her pork belly(but sadly she got sick). I really enjoyed the ribs - they were marinated in a honey, soy and whisky based marinade but I would liken it more to a glaze. Two dipping sauces were offered, I didn't much care for the spicy one, the sweet one was more harmonious with the ribs. I ended up ordering a coconut rice to finish off the meal. I really, really liked the ribs but I should have ordered the cucumber salad as well. My partner noted our water tasted funny but it was because it was accented with pandan and rosewater. \\n\\nNow, if it wasn't for my partnet getting sick afterwards, I would give Pok Pok 4 stars.

From the fading sign out front to the totally retro interior this place totally reminds me of a Pizza Parlour I used to go to with my Little League teammates to celebrate a victory. Heck they even still rock one of those old school fat TVs. Very plain looking inside with a Dark Brown palate and communal seating in the front for the larger parties. Don't fret though as they have another section toward the back and off to the left with booth seating for smaller parties!\\n\\nTheir menu is pretty expansive here with items that range from pizza, to subs, to salads, and to BBQ amongst a few other items as well. They also have various beers available if you'd like!\\n\\nAfter I had their pizza I was ready to give this place a 2 star rating like many others, but I had a sandwich there as well which proved considerably better and thus the higher rating. Their pizza was still pretty inexcusable though. They offer Gluten Free Pizzas, but I seriously couldn't imagine what those must taste like.  I'm really surprised that they actually boast to be \\"the best pizza in Vancouver since 1965.\\" I couldn't disagree more as I love The Blind Onion and Garlic Jim's considerably more.

The pizza was not only insipid, but also tedious. The crust was thin and much like another reviewer mentioned did seem more like a cracker without the minute benefits of being a cracker. The pizza comes with two different kinds of cheeses and the toppings go all the way to the edge, but the pizza was pretty boring if you know what I mean. The toppings did not have that much of a taste except for an extreme (unwelcomed) smokiness from the BBQ. The smokiness did not complement the pie at all. I did like the fact that they did not overbake the pizza so my crust was not burnt to make it even worse.\\n\\nOne time I had their Hot Italian Sub: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smokeys-hot-oven-pizza-vancouver?select=oHgf8rsf7qy4MY5RcZYsdw#myxEm9WoeO2tPjcJ5ek-vw which despite being veiled by the smoky flavor was still quite delicious. This sammie comes with a choice of 3 different types of meats (for mine I chose Italian Sausage Bits,) Red Onions, Pizza Sauce, Mozzarella Cheese, and Bell Peppers all wrapped in a bakery fresh French Roll. What this proved was a significant improvement over their pie. The sauce had a very nice flavor that complemented the other ingredients perfectly. The sausage although delicious, did taste a little corporate and contrived, but whatever... I still enjoyed their sammie.\\n\\nThis place boasts free wi-fi, a couple of computers for their patrons, some games, a pretty large fish tank, and two different dining areas. The place is much larger than it looks on the outside.\\n\\nThey rock both communal tables as well as booth seating for their patrons.\\n\\nThere is plenty of parking in their dedicated lot!\\n\\nService was really kind by everyone I encountered and when my food was ready it was brought to my table!\\n\\nAlthough I am not really a fan of their hot oven pizzas...

My group and I arrived at 7pm, and thought that we were to be seated at a 4-person table near the window. Instead, an older lady (the owner, I presume) who I had not seen before barked at the waiter, who told us we would be sitting at a wooden table in the darkest furthest corner of the restaurant near the kitchen, where the old lady was currently watching over a platter of baklava. She ignored us, got up, and ordered the waiter to direct us there. They made no effort to clean the table, put a tablecloth or silverware, and just indicated for us to sit.\\n\\nI asked the waiter if we could sit at the window booth, and he replied that there was a party of 5 coming. To which I replied that I thought the table in the corner could accommodate 5 as well, and since we were first to arrive, could he give us the other table. The old lady yelled at him when he asked her, and he told us that he could not. I then politely asked him if he could put two smaller tables together near the entrance instead.\\n\\nAfter we had sat down and were ready to order, the old lady came over and started loudly lecturing me in front of the other patrons about how rude I was to ask the waiter to put us at the window booth. She said I was thoughtless because how could she put a group of 5 in the corner table (it would have fit 5 people). I was shocked, and could only politely respond that we had made a reservation, we arrived first, and it was my graduation so I preferred a better location near the window. \\n\\nDear readers, she did not stop, but continued to vociferously berate me in front of the entire restaurant. In front of my mother. In front of my closest friends. On the day of my graduation, which she knew because I clearly told her twice. I asked her to stop yelling at me, and she said, \\"I'm not yelling at you. I'm just telling you how rude you are for asking to switch tables.\\" etc etc. \\n\\nI simply could not take this unwarranted and exceedingly rude behavior anymore, and got up, told the waiter \\"I love the food here, but I am never ever setting foot in this restaurant again.\\" I left with my group, and as I was leaving, she kept on yelling at me from the kitchen. I must admit that I finally lost my cool and told her to shut her mouth. I was mortified and extremely vexed by this public humiliation.\\n\\nLuckily, we were able to find another place to celebrate, but I will never darken Baraka Cafe's door again. In my humble opinion, a restaurant should not only offer delicious food and a suitable ambiance, but also friendly service. I feel sad for the people who work under her, because they were clearly scared of her and under her thumb. Although my friend suggested that since she is North African, a former French colony, and the French have a different service tradition, this might account for her behavior. I don't think this is the case - I have never been yelled at or chastised in any restaurant in France, no matter how desultory the service. In any case, there is NO EXCUSE for what she did.\\n\\nApologies for the long review, but I think that everyone should know how this restaurant is run. Sometimes the lady isn't there (such as the first time I was there), and sometimes she is, but in either case, I'd rather not patronize a restaurant that engages in public humiliation of its clients."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Yum.

From what I understand about the previous space, this is a huge change - it was very trendy and sleek before.\\n\\nI booked on OpenTable.com and I must point out that it seems the hosts do pay attention to the comments section. I had noted we'd be dining with the CFO of our company and it was a team celebration. We were seated in a semi-private alcove that overlooked the rest of the dining room - perfect! We were out of the direct line of hustle and bustle but still felt we were part of the action. \\n\\nOur server's name was Chris and he was well versed on the menu. He suggested our group of 7 start with some petites bouchees - two orders each of the barbajuans and fried artichokes - both which were quite tasty. \\n\\nChris also mentioned that the stuffed calamari, tuna tartare tarntine and goat cheese and beet salad were at the top of the list as for the starters. Most of the group stuck with one of these three and we all enjoyed our selections. \\n\\nI had the pan-roasted cod for my entree. Solid and good, but portion  size is definitely on the \\"small food\\" side. This is the kind of place where you order a starter to complete the meal; we also ordered several sides for the table which we shared. Two others ordered the lamb which looked and smelled delicious and was devoured. One ordered the lobster mac and cheese, which he enjoyed but didn't seem over the moon about. Chris touted the bouillabaisse as one of the featured dishes and it won accolades from my colleague.\\n\\nGreat place for a dinner with colleagues or the fam for a celebration.  Also a good choice for date night when you want something special but not over pretentious. Good for a catch up session with a small group of friends, but probably wouldn't be my first choice for a birthday celebration with my girlfriends - but we tend to be a more raucous group. \\n\\nAll in all a great experience. Will definitely go back!"},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place!!!!!! so glad I have one near my house/work.

One thing this place has over other creperies is that filling is evenly distributed throughout the crepes. Typically, especially at the ends, you have bites of nothing but crepe. Not the case here. Another big thing is that they DIDN'T skimp on salmon. Another common occurrence. It was nice to actually taste salmon in every bite. Then we decided to splurge and split a dessert crepe.

My problem was I was done found the food satisfactory at best. My advice to the owners is provide decision rights to your waitresses and bartenders to exchange $2 to $4 sides if people don't like them.

The broth was overly rich and oily, and had only a hint of Yuzu. So I left hungry and with an unpleasant and  lingering taste of pork fat that remained for more than half an hour.\\n\\nThere are other appetizing dishes in the menu, many of which are some of my usual izakaya favorites, but the prices are definitely on the high side and I really don't know what to expect in terms of quality.

And even the standard calendar, stationary, and other Portland trinkets you might need if you're trying to pick up some stocking stuffers or housewarming doodads.    \\n\\nMy parents had to drag me away when I was younger, but now I can stay as long as I want!  I have made friends in the stacks, found hidden treasures, and even sold books here knowing they'd find a good home.    \\n\\nCome, but be prepared to spend hours here -- nothing less will do."},{"name":"Avalon Pockets","address":"3564 Tanja King Blvd, Ste 2","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We get the chicken soulvaki almost every week.

Dinner is for members-only but I think you can pay a small cover fee to try it out.  I really think the restaurant portion of the Warren is underrated and underutilized.  For members, they do really fun events like paired wine or tequila tastings, comedy shows, etc.\\n\\nThe bar scene is fantastic.  You can either chill on the patio with great views of downtown Atlanta while a server brings you drinks, or inside on one of the couches or tables, or you can hang in the lively dance floor scene if you want to get your groove on.  The DJ quality is hit or miss, lately they've been mixing in some excellent electronic/hip-hop newcomers that I really dig.  Other nights you get a lot of obnoxious Katie Perry and crappy pop that I could do without.   Age generally ranges from late twenties through late thirties and most people there can hold their alcohol and act like an adult.\\n\\nService from the staff and bartenders is always top notch.  If you are nice to them, they will remember you and treat you accordingly.  Don't try to argue about the cover charge; you are not special and they have more than enough patrons without having to treat you like a princess.  Definitely a great place for a post-dinner drink, chill patio night, or all-night birthday dance party bash."},{"name":"Seattle's Best Coffee","address":"1100 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This location is closed.

The food really wasn't bad, but it was mediocre and priced slightly too high. We tried the wings, khao soi, and boar collar. The wings were alright. I didn't particularly like how they weren't separated and the tips were still intact, but the flavor was pretty good. I only ate one and half wings because I felt over salted after having consumed just that small amount. The khao soi, I've had muuuchhhh better at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. The soup at Pok Pok seemed a bit shallow and was lacking the flavor and depth the Lotus of Siam broth had. The boar collar was really forgettable to me except for the fact it came with a side of cold greens that was meant to \\"cool you down if the boar is too spicy\\" which seemed a bit confusing because the boar was not spicy at all. Although, I did enjoy the pandan water, which is probably something I will now adopt because it is a subtle and delightful treat. \\n\\nAlso, we attempted to dine here on a Sunday evening (bad idea) and ended up going elsewhere that first attempt because the hostess told us it would a 90 minute wait and we should wait over at the Whiskey Soda Lounge, which they also own. She repeated this last statement so many times that it felt like she was really pushing us to wait there to lock us into dining at Pok Pok and additionally, they would potentially make more money by getting us to buy drinks at the lounge. It was just a bit off putting. I put my name down and gave her my phone number, but we decided to dine elsewhere that evening because we didn't want to wait. I got a call from her only 40 minutes later. Had the hostess not been so pushy about the lounge and given us a correct estimate, we would have dined there that night, but instead they lost our business. We came back on a Monday late afternoon when it wasn't so crowded and the service was friendly and helpful, but nothing too over the top. \\n\\nFor the reputation Pok Pok has, I expected more, but was disappointed and I wouldn't recommend this as a dining destination."},{"name":"Papa Gino's Pizzeria","address":"Bunker Hill Mall, 19 Austin Street","city":"Charlestown","stars":"2.5","text":"A pretty decent and newly renovated Papa Gino's right by Bunker Hill.

I had almost given up, but Din Ho has them, under the name Cantonese Style noodles.  Also the Singapore noodles are the same, but with curry powder added to them.  I was in heaven.  They are a little more oily than I prefer, so if you like them a little drier like I do, ask for less oil.  The Salt and Pepper Shrimp was also great.  Nice light crispy and flavorful batter.  Besides the noodles, my favorite was the fried bean curd, which has shrimp in it, which I like but vegetarians beware.  I'm not sure if it is mentioned in on the menu.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and creamy and soft on the inside.  \\n\\nI liked the Peking duck as well, but I found that the meat was a touch bland.

The tender pasta, lightly breaded and accompanied with a creamy dipping sauce definitely got my mouth watering for what was to come.  I had the spicy shrimp wrap which was fine...good spices on the shrimp.  The dishes my friends had, and we shared are as follows:  Eggplant parm- laking flavor...odd texture, roasted chicken- moist bird, but everything else that came on the plate was disgusting, House tomato soup-way too salty.\\n\\nThe service was a bit spotty.

We are visiting from out of town with a large group. We called weeks in advance to prepare the restaurant for our arrival and even placed 40 out of 60 orders in advance. So, when I normally write reviews, I judge an establishment by the venue, ambiance, service and quality of food. \\n1. Venue- a hot mess. Like, literally. There were no tablecloths. There was old equipment lying around like a skating rink (idk why but I saw a bunch of iceskates so... ). I saw a snow cone machine, a huge slide that seems like it came from an abandoned McDonald's playground, an unsteady climbing wall, and 3 defunct video arcade systems. The bathroom had soap in 1 of 3 dispensers, and said dispenser was in the handicap stall. So good luck if someone was occupying that stall when you need to wash your hands. \\n2. Ambiance. See above. Add to the fact that they played ONE SONG the entire 3 hours we were there. Like, in a continuous loop. I wanted to bang my head on the table. I think I did, at least once. Oh, and there were also those lights shining on the wall from that machine that people now use for Xmas lights. In summary, don't take your significant other here to impress them. You will end up single.\\n3. Service. There was none. In fact, we literally served ourselves. I'm not kidding. 30 minutes after we arrived (and remember, they knew well in advance that we were coming) they finally opened up a case of bottled water and we served ourselves. We then had about 8 ladies who took turns for the next 3 hours to pass out food from the kitchen to the tables. Not once did the meager staff of 2 assist. I myself ended up taking a tray to clean my table because the dishes had piled up and i can't stand clutter \\n4. Food. My food was actually good. I had lamb chops. However, it must have been loaded with MSG because immediately after eating I got a migraine. That only happens when I consume msg so there's that. The majority of people hated their food. The vegetable lo mein consisted of salty noodles, a bunch of green peppers and onions. That's it. They ran out of spring rolls. The fried rice tasted sour. The chicken wings were hard and nasty. Vegetable curry was so spicy that it was inedible. Like it was overall a hot mess. They honestly should be ashamed of charging an average of $15 per plate. But they're not, most likely. \\n\\nSo, overall, avoid this like Ebola. I used to be a server and I've had some terrible dining experiences but this place takes the cake.

Down from, vancouver BC I had high hopes for out culinary adventures in the PDX.\\n\\nPok Pok is family style and after some brief hurried discussion about the variety of items on the menu Poppa Jared ordered for us. First up: The renowned Fish Sauce Wings. Whole chicken wings are marinated in fish sauce and palm sugar, deep fried crispy and then tossed in caramelized fish sauce and garlic and a very liberal dose of chilies upon request. It's difficult to call them the best wings of my life but gawddamn were they tasty. Sticky sweet with garlic and the tang of the fish sauce just complemented the whole deal. The spicy ones were fiery hot and had me drawing pulls from my cold Singha every few bites. Next to arrive: Wild caught Gulf prawns charcoal grilled whole and served with naam jim thaleh which means \\"spicy as fuck\\" from what I could discern. We dipped the head-on prawns in the garlic chile lime mix and crunched out way through them. If you haven't eaten a properly cooked prawn with it's shell and head on then you have to give it a try as it really is like being let in on a secret. Especially after eating the rubbery butterflied prawns that are foisted upon us in so many eateries. Jared wasn't very impressed with them but I was happy enough. No one else weighed in. That is until the Boar collar arrived. Thinly sliced Boar meat rubbed with garlic coriander and black pepper and marinated in soy and sugar. They aren't reinventing anything here but these flavours just work. Every time. The meat was tender and the chilled mustard greens and sweet spicy sauce that accompanied the meat complimented it well. This pleased everyone immensely. Stef had ordered Khao Soi, a yellow noodle curry  from Northern Thailand with Burmese origins and we all had a few slurps. A nice coconut base (house pressed apparently) with pickled mustard green and shallots. The crispy yellow noodles that came on top provided a nice textural disparity between the thick soupy broth ans the soft noodles. Pretty good. A \\"salad\\" of minced pork crispy shallot and cracklins was wonderful. I balled it up with coconut rice and rolled it in the mustard greens from the boar collar forming a little lettuce wrap type dealy. Very nice. The Flank steak salad that we had to remind our server about was mediocre after the shining star that was the Boar collar. Marinated flanks steak with flavours of mint, coriander, shallot, garlic... I'm seeing a theme here. The thing is the food may have all had similar spice and herb bases but nothing tasted the same, which was cool. The steak was a bit tough - as flank steak often is. The salad part was some cabbage and greens that I dutifully ate as I was still hungry. With sticky rice and coconut rice that accompanied all the dishes we were packed full of food by the end of the meal. Just in time for the clouds to break open and let loose a torrential downpour. \\nThe meal was one of the better Thai meals I have outside of Thailand and I recommend it to anyone who finds themselves in the neighbourhood.

We ordered a chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy and a breakfast taco. All of them had a unique flavor and definitely weren't mass produced. All of this and a couple coffees came to 18 bucks.

It was recently announced that the entire plaza would be razed and re-developed for a new retail tenant.  Unfortunately, it appears that that tenant may be WalMart!\\n\\nThe plaza is mostly vacant with such tenants as Skyline Chili, Dairy Queen, Westshore Pizza, and others having already closed their businesses.  Amul India is closing on November 3 and has yet to identify a new location.\\n\\nThis is a dining blog, so I will spare you my thoughts of a WalMart disrupting the Olde Sawmill residential community as well as the already congested Sawmill Road.\\n\\nAs always, I opted for the lunch buffet ($8.99 on weekdays and $9.99 on Saturday and Sunday) this afternoon.  It is difficult to settle on just one dish and Amul India offers many fine selections.\\n\\nToday's buffet included such items as Saag Paneer, Dal Makhani Chicken Makhani, Tandoori Chicken, and Aloo Pepper.  I chose two dishes that I had never tried before - Chicken 65 and Ginger Paneer with a piece of Bhatura.\\n\\nChicken 65 is a spicy chicken offering with a rather curious name.  Wikipedia offers a variety of theories regarding the origin of the name, but it may be as simple as representing the year that the dish was introduced at the Buhari Hotel in the Indian city of Chennai.  Interestingly, the hotel apparently offers Chicken 78, Chicken 82, and Chicken 90!\\n\\nAmul India eschews the typical deep frying of the main ingredient in their Chicken 65.  It is, however, marinated in several spices (most likely turmeric, red chili, garlic, and others) giving it a distinctly spicy flavor.

My gauge of how good an Italian restaurant is depends on if they can make angel hair pasta well. Here it is perfect, as is their delicious ravioli. Their sauce is amazing, not the grease-laden heavy tomato sauce that many restaurants have. The sauce is sweet and not overdone with herbs and oil. My favorite dish is the chicken fiorentina, the chicken melts in your mouth and is sauteed, not deep-fried. Combined with spinach and cheese, this dish is perfection. I have found the service to be attentive and friendly. The foccacia bread is great and I love their house balsamic dressing. This has become \\"our place\\" for my husband and I.

It's just that I know that perfect steaks dinners are out there and spending $200 for two people, should get you there.

Otherwise, as far as I'm concerned, this place does not live up to the hype.  The service was painfully slow (as in the whole ordeal took more than 2.5 hours), despite the fact that we were seated right away on a saturday evening.  The servers were very distant as soon as we placed our initial order, and we had a rotation of about 4 of them.  It was almost like they were mad that we didn't get oysters.\\n\\nTo be honest, the best thing was the bread and sweet butter appetizer.  The clam chowder portion was tiny.  I would say the price per volume was almost double that of Legal Sea Food, and it contained only one small chunk of clam.  There were huge bricks of bacon in the chowder, which I will certainly not complain about, but at that point, why don't you just call it seafood flavored bacon chowder?  It was in my top ten for saltiest chowder I've had in Boston.  I'll give them that.  My friend had similar complaints about the lobster bisque, and she didn't even finish it, despite how small it was.\\n\\nTo be fair, I'm sure their oysters are great, but I would much rather go to a place with a less snobby vibe and better sides (oysters alone do not a meal make).

The decor isn't anything special and actually did remind me of being in a typical Asian restaurant where the focus is on the food and nothing else.  We elected to do the boar collar and the egg/pork/prawn salad.  Both of these were very good but the heat of the boar dish is what I'll remember.  At first it was a nice mild heat from a delicious sauce.  Unlike anything I've ever eaten before the heat grew with each bite.  You'd figure it'd top out after the first few bites coated your mouth but you'd be wrong.  That heat built up to the point that it was as if the boar was fighting back posthumously (and doing a damn fine job).  If you like spicy food, you'd love this.  After several drinks of water and beer the pain started to subside but when it was gone, I missed it.

We both enjoy Thai and Vietnamese food and was excited to see what they have to offer.\\n\\nFirst of all, I have to say that parking sucks in that neighborhood. I thought the distance back to the car is enough to walk off the food. Luckily there was no wait to be seated (2 pm Friday). I noticed they had a couple seating areas. The front offers outdoor patio dining. The interior has a street market feel with colorful lighting. And the bar area which lends a slightly fancier dining experience. \\n\\nSo how was the food? Pok Pok has a good offering while it doesn't overwhelm you with choices. You could come in for a quick bite or you could come in drinking with your buddies. The drinks are unique, but seemed a little weak. My girlfriend ordered the Hunny. I ordered Lord Bergamot. The food is where they really shine I think. There are flavorful dishes. There are refreshing mild dishes. There are spicy dishes (with pretty good heat). We ordered some sticky rice on the side, but should've ordered the coconut version.

I would try to avoid this place right before or right after the Sox play at Fenway. The decor made me feel like I was not too far from Duxbury beach. The speakers overhead played music from from 80's synth to reggae to lounge piano music. The staff was friendly and showed a very high level of professionalism and efficiency for a restaurant that has been around for only a short while, really, any restaurant for that matter. \\n\\nFew places in Boston can rival the raw bar and selection of oysters Island Creek offers. I guess it comes with the restaurant's name. Oyster sliders were nice but the bun overwhelmed most of the other components. The crab cake was packed with meat. It was very nice and built to showcase the crab. \\n\\nI ordered the skate with quinoa and bok choy and my girlfriend ordered the lobster roe pasta with lobster, braised short rib, peas and chanterelles. Mine was a nice clean dish, but, I am pretty upset I did not order the lobster pasta. I am still thinking about it. The skate was very good and cooked nice but the pasta was something else. The buttermilk biscuit was pretty awesome too. I'll be be back, probably not too long from now, and I will definitely get one of the lobster pasta.

Well, I went today for happy hour at the NEW Zeds and it has a chance to be better - we'll see.  First, the bartender Lindsey was attentive and friendly and promised that when I come back for a martini I won't be disappointed (the second worst martini of my life was had at the first Zeds).  For now the happy hour house Merlot was good enough for a $4 glass of wine.  I ordered the grilled artichoke starter (half price at happy hour) and it has the potential to be a great little dish BUT the artichoke was so undercooked before going onto the grill that it was pretty much inedible like shoe leather.  If they would steam it to al dente before putting it on the grill it could be really terrific (also, they missed removing some of the choke - I know what it looks like so was able to get it out before eating it, but someone not so familiar with artichoke would have been in for an unpleasant surprise!)  But like I said, the flavor on the little bits that I could eat was really nice and smoky with a balsamic reduction and the dipping sauce was quite nice too.\\nSo, I plan to go back soon for that martini and will try the brussel sprouts for sure - my fingers are crossed for a good experience.

To our surprise, we only ended up waiting 10 minutes for a table. \\n\\nWe ordered the Spinach Goma-ae, the Yuzu Shio Ramen, and the Vegetable Ramen. \\n\\nThe flavor of the spinach goma-ae was spot on. I was disappointed with the portion size. For $4, I expect a little more than a few bites of spinach. The sesame dressing was great. I only wish there was more of it to enjoy!\\n\\nMy wife had the yuzu shio ramen. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were well cooked. \\n\\nI had the vegetable ramen with a soft-boiled egg added. The egg was well cooked and seemed to be of high quality. I was impressed with the great flavor of a vegetable based ramen broth. \\n\\nOverall, our experience was OK. The food was tasty, but nothing extraordinary. The staff was busy but attentive.
