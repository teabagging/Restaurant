I came here with the BF for a nice anniversary dinner and had a lovely time.  We opted for the tasting menu and were not disappointed.  Awesome restaurant with cool d√©cor, great music in the background, and not too loud so we could talk without having to shout even with a full house on a Friday night. \\nI thought the tasting menu was well done and I appreciated the progression as we went through the meal.  Portions were perfect and I felt satiated but not stuffed by the last course.  Some of the highlights were the grouper and sorrel dish (the sorrel was sooo good), the pig skin noodles (never had anything like this, and it was amazing) and the hand's down best course: smoked pork shoulder with peach and eggplant.  I can't say enough about the broth, the bread, just....I would come back to just order the broth from that dish and some of that amazing bread to sop it up.  Just a perfect dish. The chocolate ice cream sandwich with honeycomb and pecans was my favorite dessert and great end to the meal.\\nThe only misstep for us was the duck two ways.  Loved the stuffed duck in the shisito pepper, but the breast was...dry and kind of bland.  But considering how many courses we had and that being our only real criticism...this restaurant is definitely as good as it gets.\\nWe had their house 'soda' with our meal.  I liked them, but my BF did not.  Service was friendly and attentive, and the timing of the courses was perfect.  \\nThis is definitely a place you need to make reservations if you are looking for seating on Friday or Saturday.

Expertly cooked pasta. Improved fritto misto. Even better service."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Parish Cafe is a social hub of sorts, intention and end. A bar and sandwich restaurant (and really more of a pub than a bar), the unit focuses on a type of customer loyalty, a relaxed ambiance, and inventive menu concept to draw people in other restaurants only dream of - it's designed to make people talk.\\n\\nWhat makes Parish Cafe unique is perhaps twofold: one is its beer loyalty program, whereupon drinking through a menu of 100 brews in under 120 days or something of that sort, you are awarded a large glass mug with your name inscribed to be stored at the bar, the advantage being that from that point onward when you order a beer, there is a fuller pour and some recognition awaiting.\\n\\nSecond, the food. Parish Cafe's menu is comprised of sandwich items recipe'd by various popular local chefs. As expected, the dishes may not have quite the common denominator most restaurant menus should, but they're all sandwiches, and the variation somehow fits if but in a different yet delightful way.\\n\\nThird, and perhaps this was just the effect of squeezing 8 people in next to a window, this restaurant feels a bit straight out of TV.\\n\\nThe Hot and Cold Chicken Salad / $11.75\\nGrilled and chilled chicken breast marinated in olive oil and garlic served with arugula, caramelized almonds, shaved carrots and chilled snap peas over warm sticky rice with a sesame-soy vinaigrette.\\n\\nAnother menu item I would probably only come up with at 3am, the hot and cold combination is striking. Arugula often is the leaf of choice for such heated variations, and the olive oil thankfully doesn't drench the rest of the dish. The warm sticky rice fits the Asian-themed dish and salad better than expected, and though I'm never going to like any species of peas, the dish is cohesive and enjoyable, especially to share. It actually reminds me of bibimbap in ways.\\n\\nLe Mistral / $19.25\\nGarlic and rosemary marinated beef tenderloin grilled to medium rare, served on ciabatta with caramelized onions, chive mashed potatoes and melted Bel Paese cheese. Topped with seasoned arugula, a truffle aioli and crispy onions. Sided with Cape Cod potato chips.\\n\\nJust read that description again. Doesn't it sound delicious? To me, it tasted as expected and sounds, enough of a compliment on its own. I'm never going to love ciabatta or any of the harder crusted breads, even with their purposes; it takes an exceptionally moist and creamy sandwich in order to compensate or rationalize it, and this one does. Regarding the truffle oil - I know its a bit of a trend ingredient used typically in splash just to bump the price and class up a bit more, but I think it has a nice way of balancing the largely heavy components of the rest of the sandwich. Surely citrus or some other cheaper ingredient could have done the trick too, but what's the fun in that?\\n\\nSpicy Tuna Burger / $19.25\\nSashimi grade yellowfin tuna, finely chopped, formed into a patty and grilled to medium rare. Served on a classic seeded burger bun with homemade spicy mayo, thinly sliced pickled ginger, chopped scallions, mixed greens, Roma tomatoes, toasted sesame seeds and a kabayaki drizzle. Sided with Cape Cod potato chips.\\n\\nPerhaps the most interesting sandwich out of the bunch, the yellowfin is served seared fairly thouroughly, hurting my inner expectation and desire for sashimi. I will readily admit though that it is served quite deliciously, the patty a fairly different concept to me, and the scallions rounding it out nicely.\\n\\nIt's not difficult to see why Parish Cafe is popular. With one of the cooler and more relaxing restaurants I've been to in Boston, the atmosphere allows for talking, but wasn't too loud to hear each other - thank goodness. More importantly, we enjoyed our time here, and as good as the food is at Parish, I think that's even more the goal."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This is a takeout review.

First off, when I arrived they couldn't find my reservation, I confirmed it twice with the gentleman on the phone so I was comfortable as I knew it was the night before Mothers Day. In previous visits both of us experienced a level of food and service unlike other restaurants in Orlando but this evening there was something missing. Our first waiter took our drink orders and provided us with the specials, one of them was the Souffle which needed to be order 25min ahead so we told him right away to put that in now so we'll have it when our meal was complete. After a few minutes, a second waiter approached and told us he would be taking care of us. So we order appetizers I had the Escargot and my wife had the Caesar salad both were very good, as was the potato leek soup which we both ordered. But then the meal took a downward slide. I ordered the special Blackened Ahi Tuna which was prepared perfect, but the Parmasian Mashed potatoes were stiff and cold, my wife ordered the Lamb Chops with the Blue Cheese sauce also exceptional and her potatoes were also stiff and cold. When we brought it up to the waiter he provided a less than interested response and offered to replace them, but we were well into our meal. Upon completion, we were looking forward to the Souffle with Chocolate sauce, when it arrived it appeared somewhat distressed upon further examination it was burnt and the inside had fallen. At that moment, I couldn't contain myself and insisted on speaking with the manager, also being somewhat polite and uninterested he took the desert off the bill but the damage was done. The sad part, in previous visits to Chez Vincent, we were able to speak to the chef and ask him questions, it appears he was too busy to receive a discussion from a customer.

As I had read through many reviews of Schmidt's here and elsewhere, I was hesitant to go there. But, as anyone with a long time spouse or SO, you pick your battles and this one wasn't worth it.\\n\\nWe arrived just prior to their opening so we decided to do the \\"Autobahn Buffet.\\" I'm not a fan of buffets but, since they had just opened and were among the first seated, I considered it \\"safe\\" enough.\\n\\nThe good: tossed green salad - good and fresh with a nice selection of optional toppings.\\nOh, and the service. Server was exceptional.\\n\\nThe bad: nearly everything else. My SO talked me into trying a cup of their chili - which, just by it's appearance was not appetizing to me. I was right. Tasted like tomato juice with beans and a scant hint of beef. On the salad bar was \\"regular\\" not German potato salad. Being a huge fan and also a self admitted potato salad snob, I gave it a try. It had no flavor except sweet. I hate American style potato salad that is sweet. I later discovered the German potato salad elsewhere in the buffet setup. Instead of having that nice balance of sweet and tart as it should, it was as sour as the warm sauerkraut on the buffet - which was also to be avoided.\\n\\nThe buffet offered three of Schmidt's \\"famous\\" sausages - Bahama Mama, Garlic and Bratwurst. Honestly, I didn't care for any of them. All were extremely fatty and I found nothing exciting about any of them. The green beans offering were cooked to death; a red cabbage and apples dish was OK, macaroni and cheese (I assume for children who aren't fans of a German buffet) was soupy, tasteless and not even a close second to boxed macaroni and cheese.\\n\\nProbably the offering I disliked the most was \\"Sausage Stew\\" - a very odd blend of one of their \\"famous\\" sausages, long, curled Cavatapi style noodles and some very odd spices/seasonings. It was not edible.\\n\\nOrdered a Schmidt's \\"Gold\\" lager to go with lunch. My glass of water was more enjoyable.\\n\\nMy SO wasn't leaving without taking some of Schmidt's (again - \\"famous\\") cream puffs home. As good as they looked, by this time I was so disappointed by the entire Schmidt's food experience that the thought of actually eating one nauseated me.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you are a fan of mostly tasteless, heavy, gloppy food and want to absolutely stuff yourself - go for it. \\n\\nFor me, next visit, I think I'll check out one of the lighter fare gastro pubs in the Brewery District."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"YUM!

My other friend and I both got the Cauliflower...I want to call it a Hash with two eggs over-easy.  It had a mixture of caulfilower, kale, sauteed potatoes, harissa, feta, and roasted red peppers.  It was strange that the server had to warn us that the eggs were more runny than normal over-easy eggs--our minds automatically thought, 'did they warn us that don't make their over-easy eggs correctly?'  Most people that ask for a specific preparation of eggs know what they like.  Anyway, that dish was amazing.  I loved the combination of ingredients and flavour profile of the added harissa, perfectly seasoned and spiced.  Eggs were nicely runny as requested.  Friends thought their omelettes were delicious and fluffy, potatoes could've been more seasoned.  We were content, no complaints here. \\n\\nPretty quick turn around time and services was decent.

I have wanted to find a good Southern home cookin' kind of joint to get good fried chicken, meatloaf, biscuits and the like for a while. The diner scene around town is pretty abysmal, so I keep on looking. I was skeptical of this place to begin with because of the association with 4Rivers, which I find to be mostly just okay at best. I guess I would actually give this place 2 1/2 stars if I could. Okay, on to my actual experience.\\n\\nI stopped in on a weekday afternoon between lunch and dinner time around 2:30. So, in some ways, this may not be a fair example since that is always a bad time to try any place that is not super busy, and clearly explains some of the issues I noticed. First, the good: their fried chicken is indeed very good. The pieces of chicken are very large, juicy and tender. My standard two piece meal came with a leg and a breast quarter that were both nicely seasoned and just a little crispy. I really liked the chicken, although it could have been a good bit crispier, it was still very tasty. The sides I tried out were their greens and sweet potatoes. Just like 4Rivers they feel compelled to put a ton of sugar in all their sides, making the sweet potatoes way too sweet and the collard greens unecesarily sweet as well. I understand wanting to cut the bitterness of the greens but they go overboard. The greens did have a ton of ham chunks in the mix, which is nice, but some of the ham pieces had very small, very sharp, pieces of bone as well so that was not good. I also had one of their biscuits/ I know huge biscuits look impressive but the only way that really works is if you can manage to make them light and fluffy on the inside. This biscuit was essentially nicely browned on the outside and a hunk of nearly raw dough in the middle. I scraped out the center and enjoyed the outside of the biscuit with my meal and the last bite with a touch of honey.\\n\\nNow, the space itself: I like the serve yourself drink station with honey, spicy vinegar, eating utensils and the like. There was a spot for lemon wedges for your tea, but it was sadly empty. I guess I could have asked but it wasn't that important. Anyway, this area as well as the area where you are supposed to dump your trash and leave your plates and silverware in bus pans was very much neglected and quite filthy with dirty dishes piled up with crusty old food on them. This is where my timing was probably not the best since they most likely were not fully staffed mid-afternoon. I do like the eclectic mismatched tables and chairs decor. It's a fun, family style, look and feel.\\n\\nI will probably stop back by here one day when I am in the Park Ave area and give them another try just to get a sense of what the rest of their fare is like.

The reason is that I'm a picky eater.  When I order a pizza here with special request, such as easy-on-the-cheese, they get it wrong literally about 1/3 of the time and seem to put extra cheese.  I've only had the thin crust here and when they get it right it's great.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because it's 'almost' hit-or-miss if they're gonna get it right if you're not ordering something standard off the menu.  If you're doing that then you'll be okay.  I think the cooks are on auto-pilot and look for key words on the order ticket but don't pay attention to the details.  If anyone at Mangia is reading this...please have your cooks read the tickets closer!  And on a delivery they actually did put my order in wrong and I got mushrooms on my pizza.  I hate mushrooms.  This time is wasn't the cook's fault because somehow mushrooms ended up on the ticket for my order.  I did not and never order mushrooms.  When I called about it the manager was actually a bit short with me as if it was MY fault, but they did end up crediting me.  Despite this, for food I've had there...when they get your order correct...is very tasty.  But if you're picky like myself and you have special instructions for your order, check it upon delivery or pick-up because in my experience there's a very real chance it will be incorrect in some way.  A couple times I've thrown it out when I couldn't eat what they sent me because I didn't  have time or energy to deal with trying to return it.  But when they get it right it's good enough that I still keep ordering from them and for the area it's probably the best pizza for delivery.

Might be good if you're into that. \\n\\nMaple bacon - decent but Sidecar's version is still the best in my book. \\n\\nPb & jelly - my fianc√© ate the entire donut without letting me try it :( but I guess that's saying something because he isn't a big sweets person. He assured me it was delicious. \\n\\nTiramisu - my fave flavoe of the batch. It was really good but honestly didn't really taste like tiramisu. \\n\\nI'll have to try the LA location...

Their dinner menu is on the smaller side of options but everything sounded so good, we had a hard time deciding. As a table we shared many items; the fried green tomato salad was good and lite, although the fried tomatoes were a bit bland, and the sugar maple poulet rouge was good and had a nice smoky flavor. The petit filet mignon with bacon whipped potatoes was my favorite as the steak was tender and the whipped potatoes were smooth and delicious.  For dessert we had the summer berry fruit crisp and the chocolate lava cake.  They were good but I wasn't a fan of  either.

The crust is nice and thin, and they don't skimp on the toppings. They also have a variety of specialty pizzas for different tastes. Personally I always go for the sausage and garlic. My girlfriend goes for the pepperoni and hot peppers. You can also customize and make your own. \\n\\nHere are the two downsides: First, it's cash only. Normally that doesn't bother me for like a bar, or food stand. But at a restaurant where you could be dropping upwards of $60, and splitting the bill with a bunch of people who only have twenties....there should really be a credit card machine. \\n\\nSecond: The service is terrible. It's as legendary as the pizza. After you're seated, even if the place is empty, it's takes forever for your server to hit the table with menus, and once you get the menus, it takes forever for them to take your order. By the time the food arrives, you've probably already eaten a member of your party. Between asking for the check and receiving it, a whole band of ox-driven, wagons could have crossed the continental United States. \\n\\nOne top of that, servers can be rude, inattentive, and careless.

First stop on my pizza tour of Boston was the one off the beaten path: Santarpio's.  I've been reading about this place for the last few years as it is one of the oldest pizzerias in the country (1933), and has won a lot of critical acclaim.  The building is interesting, with empty tomato cans for cigarette smokers outside, an awesome old school hand-drawn sign, and an out-of-place billboard on top (I think it was for women's bags or something).  The inside is a raw, dingy bar-like room with a bunch of wooden booths.  It wasn't busy when we went, so menus were readily available on every table.  Our waiter was a little crotchety but a nice guy who did his job well, continually ribbing the table of Floridians next to us.  As you can probably tell I like the place--unfortunately the pizza didn't quite measure up.  \\n\\nAs recommended extensively on Yelp, we decided on a small pie with sausage and garlic.  In hindsight I wish we tried some grilled meat too, but whatever.  The pizza was good but I found it overrated.  The crust seemed to be a converted Italian bread dough recipe.  However this one wasn't adapted much, as the cornicione was hard and dry.  It had decent bready flavor, but nothing spectacular like I've read elsewhere.  The toppings were good, with the cheese and sauce melding together wonderfully.  Unfortunately the crust couldn't hold up to this synergy and the resulting liquid, as it started out a little floppy and got worse as the pie cooled; I would not call this pie crisp as many others have noted (looking at you Alan Richman).  It had a hard, leatheriness to it towards the outside which wasn't bad, but I definitely could've done with less cornmeal.  The sausage was definitely a cut above and the garlic helped develop the various flavors as well.  All in all this was a pretty good pie, but just not world-beating like the press.\\n\\nI pose a question: what's more important, the institution or the product?  The institution I would say is the answer in this case.  As noted elsewhere and on Yelp, Santarpio's makes pizza the way they want to.  If you don't like it, don't come; they're lucky not to need the business.  While I feel some of the higher ratings can be attributed to nostaglia, I can definitely see why Satarpio's is special.

Another groomsman tried the bourbon mary, which in addition to substituting bourbon for vodka contains a slice of candied bacon at the bottom of the glass.  \\n\\nAt Kim's suggestion, we tried the candy bacon appetizer (what man doesn't like bacon, right?!)  The five slices all could have been cooked a bit more and I don't know that I would call them \\"candied\\" so much as they were slathered with brown sugar and maple syrup (I think).  I would not order this again, or rather I shouldn't order this again for my health!\\n\\nThey offer several salads and I could have gone with any of them.  At Kim's suggestion, I tried the Napa Salad, which contained the perfect amount of cranberries, pancetta and cheese crumbles (it said \\"blue\\" cheese, but I think it was a variety I am not familiar with).   The salad was big enough for me, but I would not call it an \\"entree\\".  Other men had chicken sandwich, french toast and the groom had a three egg, ham and potato cake breakfast.  No complaints on any of it and the breakfast items are definitely big enough to be called \\"brunch\\" because you won't want to eat again until dinner!"},{"name":"Casa Maria","address":"4327 S 1st St, Ste 102","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went here for lunch and got the beef enchilada special with red sauce.

It didn't taste like it ever was made from apples, especially for $4.59 for the stupid mug. I was not going to drink that.\\n\\nOh well, guess what? Because this place sucks and they know it, their policy is to not let you return an item even if it tastes like instant cider from the clearance section at Kroger. When we finally got a server to come over she gave me some serious attitude and it was none too appreciated and turned me off from even allowing them to make another drink. Also you gotta be kidding me, if I complain about a drink, do you really think I want the spit or whatever you're gonna add to the new one with that bitchface and defensive behavior? She starts berating me that it's apple juice, cinnamon, and sugar. YEAH WELL, TO QUOTE MYTHBUSTERS, THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM. That isn't apple cider. For $4.59, if you're gonna use apple juice, it should damn well taste like the kind actually made from apples, I'm pretty sure it was the pathetic crap passed off as apple juice made from concentrate.\\n\\nAfter putting up with the attitude long enough we got a manager to actually take it off the check because I was not having these people make me another drink. \\n\\nI honestly have no idea how this place is still in business.

I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.\\" -- The Big Lebowski (1998)\\n\\nDisclaimer - they have been open 1 week & there are kinks to work out.  I will be back & will review again.  However, since I cannot give 3.5 stars - they get 4. Our server saved them from getting only 3.\\n\\nThe newest in adult entertainment venues, The Painted Pin tucked away off Miami Circle down a little alleyway.  It is a bar combined with bowling lanes, indoor bocce ball courts & other games.  They have a pretty decent-sized menu - both food & drink - & servers that work the space.\\n\\nWe pulled up & were greeted by the valet staff - friendly, attentive, prompt with the ticket. You walk up to this large iron-looking door & I was immediately intrigued.  We stepped inside and were greeted by the young woman at the front desk and they asked if we were bowling - yes we were.  She wrote down our shoe sizes (they run large, so you probably want a half size smaller than your normal).  If you don't have socks - they sell them, along with tee shirts as well.  By the time we got to our lane, our names were already on the screen & very quickly a large box arrived with our shoes in it.\\n\\nWe changed into the bowling shoes & were introduced to Kristen, our server.  She walked us through the spiel & told us to put our personal shoes in the box to give us more room in the sitting area & she took our drink orders.  Complaint 1 - there is not enough room between the sofas & the table to get past each other when it is your time to bowl.  We tried a musical seats number for awhile, but add alcohol to the mix and that was almost disastrous.  They need a couple more inches of legroom to be able to maneuver well.\\n\\nThey have Crispin Cider - points. They have a decent cocktail menu. However, drinks are small, overpriced for the size & lack of potency. However, we are basically in Buckhead - so it is the standard there.\\n\\nKristen brought us waters with our drinks & we ordered a couple of appetizers after talking through her favorites/recommendations.  We started with the cheese plate (FYI, she was quite attentive to my tree nut allergy and said except for edamame, that was the closest thing to a tree nut on the menu).  Score! We also ordered the Loaded fries.\\n\\nCheese plate was great - it came with 3 cheeses, some crackers, a strawberry jam roasted edamame and grilled strawberries. I will say that the grilled berries looked rotten at first - I had to ask about them. Once we found out and tasted them, quite yummy. Scored well for this app, but I would have liked a bit more cheese for the ratio of crackers.  Next up the fries - awesome.  Cheesy bechamel sauce, fresno peppers and chunks of rendered bacon with a crema on top - yes please can i have some more? Spicy and delicious.\\n\\nNext round, we ordered a couple orders of the Fried Oyster Sliders - big fail on this one.  3 sliders - but they were really more like mini poboys (mini hot dog buns). There was only 1 fried oyster on each, so the bread to protein ratio was so far off the mark, it was nuts. Plus, the bread was very dry and almost inedible. I would not order these again. The chow chow on top was tasty as was the sriracha mayo. The oysters were tasty - not worth the money. We ate 4 of the 6 we ordered - not a good sign.\\n\\nMysteriously, there was a pizza that appeared at the table - spicy chorizo.  We were told it was complimentary - we were not charged for it.  I think they are trying to impress the folks coming in the first week (the table behind us also had a pizza).  The pizza was pretty good.  Large pieces of red fresno chilies, spicy chorizo and fresh mozzarella.  The crust was pretty stellar - so were the toppings.\\n\\nWe finished bowling, paid the tab (we should have told Kristen we wanted to pay separate up front). We straitened it out the confusion -  she was super apologetic.  I don't dock any stars for this - just as much our mistake as hers.  We decided to check out the rest of the place. We played ping-pong (they have a room with 2 tables). Kristen came to check on us, brought us more drinks & then seemed to find us/check on us wherever we were.  They had quality tables and a fun little room with a TV on the wall.\\n\\nWe moved on to Skee-Ball & Basketball (pop-a-shots) & were like kids again - okay grown up kids because we had cocktails in hand!  A couple of other items - one of the Skee-Ball machines has only 2 balls left in it - a maintenance guy told us that day 2 someone stole the rest of the balls from the machine. That's a shame. The bathrooms are very nice - but need a little work. So the sinks are trough-style & have a pass-thru to the Men's room. Odd. Also, the faucets are so high powered that it splashed me, the wall, the paper towels (no dispenser), my clothes... they need to turn those down substantially.\\n\\nNote after 7:30p it is 21+, but they do not force the kids that are there to leave promptly at that time."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"209 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Terrible service.

We've tried to come here a few times and been unsuccessful due to opening time-I think they open at 3pm or at least they did the days we visited. I was a little hesitant to eat dinner here because of the reviews but we decided to try it out. \\n\\nThe menu seemed a bit too swanky for a brewery.  With my Santa Cruz mentality in tow, I didn't even consider an eatery in PDX  that would not have at least a couple vegetarian options ready and willing to be ordered up. Not only were the options not there, but the one option that was a salad was expensive, tiny and not so big on flavor. My boyfriend sat down and asked when they were bringing my meal then he got his meal and wondered the same. We ended up stopping an hour later for dinner. \\n\\nWe were excited to try the beers here FINALLY. We usually find a few good beers out of a sampler and are shocked if there are more than half. That's just the way it usually goes.  The Oatmeal Pale Ale, Alter Ego Imperial IPA and the Burnside IPA were the standouts for us here. The Sweet Heat wasn't my favorite, it was very peppery and left a lot for my palette to desire. The spicy beers seem to be all the rage right now so maybe just not my thing. The Oyster Strong Ale and the Perma Frost Winter Strong Ale were under fermented and a little undercarbonated. They were lacking a little balance it seemed. \\n\\nOverall, I think the hype we built around finally getting to try this place left us disappointed in both the beer and food departments. However, the service was great, parking ample,music was an eclectic mix at a perfect volume. It is a charmer of a building with quite a fun atmosphere. \\n\\nI always like to give beer a second chance so I will do so next time we're swinging through town and see if I can get to the 50%-thumbs-up-sampler mark."},{"name":"El Potro Mexican Grill","address":"156 Highland Ave","city":"Malden","stars":"4.5","text":"Went with a small group on a random Thursday afternoon and had the most amazing meal!

Pizza skins get cut into 4 slices or 6. I've always had them cut into 8 slices and 6 slices respectively before visiting this location. They also seem to make lighter use of some toppings for certain pizzas. Don't get me wrong, it's still better than Domino's or the next pizza place, I'm just not the biggest fan of this location.

I love food. I love art. I love my family. I love strange foods and new drinks. This was the perfect place to take me.\\n\\nBOMA is housed in an old church. I had my dinner in what used to be the choir loft. Our waiter was scrupulously perfect and even gave me special attention since he knew it was my night to celebrate. We split two appetizers between 7 people: seared sea scallops with cocoa, espresso, smoked onions, and goat cheese polenta; and the artisanal selection of fine meats and cheeses. The sea scallops were cooked perfectly, but the cocoa/espresso dusting wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be. I think I sampled every meat and cheese on the artisanal platter, and I liked every one of them.\\n\\nSince it was my night to eat, I decided to gorge myself. After the appetizer, I got the BOMA salad. This might be the tastiest mix of fruits and veggies I will ever eat in my life. The chef dressed up ordinary field greens with granny smith apples, cherries, pecans, gorgonzola cheese, and a champagne honey vinaigrette. The result was sweet, tangy, and salty.\\n\\nWhile I waited for my entree, I sipped my spiced apple martini. I'm not a vodka drinker, so I was pleased to see a martini on the menu made with 10 Cane rum and garnished with cinnamon - yum.\\n\\nThe climax to my evening was my first sampling of ostrich. I wasn't sure what to expect. My waiter assured me the taste would not be out of my realm of comfort - granted, my realm of comfort is very wide. The big bird tasted like beef, but a very lean beef, with hardly any fat. Under my bird were thinly sliced, perfectly cooked potatoes and an oily sauce that not only looked pretty but tasted great. The most memorable part of the meal were the brandy soaked cherries that garnished the side of my ostrich plate. I have dreams about those cherries. They were so sweet and tangy, and when you put them into your mouth, they oozed with brandy liqueur.\\n\\nI exchanged dessert for another drink, this time a yellow cab made with banana liqueur. It was even better than my spiced apple martini.\\n\\nBy the end of my second drink, nature was calling. I dread using public bathrooms, and I'm an awfully hard judge when it comes to the communal commodes. But BOMA has a very clean restroom. It's well lit. There are huge mirrors. The stalls are spacious. And you don't have to touch a sink handle, a paper towel dispenser, or even a door knob when you're done. Everything is automatic, and instead of having a door, BOMA has a curvy hallway lending a little privacy to the ladies' room.\\n\\nWe sat around the table and talked for nearly an hour when we were finished eating. No one rushed us off. I felt very comfortable where we were seated. None of the other tables were too close to us. The music wasn't overwhelming.  I could see the dance floor and lounge area below. Light projections swirled above my head. There was a movie being shown to my left and a bar to my right.

Our waiter came over right away with water and was polite, friendly and efficient,  double plus.  We ordered chicken wings and drums half and half, shrimp shumai, kimchi coleslaw and the avocado ball covered in salmon.  I normally do not eat skin on chicken wings because they are usually not fried crispy, no matter how many times you ask for the chicken to be fried hard.  This chicken was crispy but tender, you couldn't even tell you were eating chicken skin.  I loved both the spicy and the garlic flavors.  The kimchi was also very good, as was the shumai.  I do however prefer the sauce you would normally get at a Japanese restaurant for the shumai but I was at a Korean restaurant so...  The only thing that I wasn't too crazy about was the avocado wrapped in salmon ball because inside it was avocado and chunks of that seafood salad mystery fish.

My cousin recommended we hit Richard Blais' Flip Burger Boutique, and I could not be happier with her choice!\\n\\nI really liked the fun, casual atmosphere of the restaurant. It felt like a modern version of a 50s diner, with clean lines, white and red decor, and - hence the FLIP! - furniture on the ceiling. Our server was incredibly friendly and chatty. It was a great place for all kinds - we saw couples on dates, sat near some families with kids (who seriously enjoyed their milkshakes), and some big groups. There was bar seating, so it seems like the kind of place you could happily eat by yourself, too. \\n\\nThe food was GREAT. We started sharing an order of the duck nuggets, which were so good that I would have been happy if we'd finished eating them, too. They came with a delicious sauce that I ended up saving as a dip for my fries. We also had the fried pickles for starters, because fried pickles are one of my new obsessions. These had a little more batter than I like on my fried pickles, but were a very good starter. I also got the Turtle milkshake - I'm really glad I got it before my burger, because it was WONDERFUL but there is no way I would have convinced myself that I had room if I'd eaten my burger first!\\n\\nThere were only 3 of us, but we did our best to try a wide range of the burgers. I went with the Cuban burger, which was the \\"burger of the day\\" - it was a pork burger with ham and swiss. It was delicious - full of flavor, hearty, innovative. Definitely a step above a regular burger. My cousin got the rBQ, which was great because I'd been debating whether to order that one. Instead, I got to try hers - and I'm glad I did. If I ever make it back here, that will be my next try! Her husband ordered the Black Diamond, because someone had to try it. I can't even remember what was on it, but I'm pretty sure truffles and foie were involved. We shared onion rings and fries with our burgers, which were good, but honestly both were unnecessary. Next time I might go for more burger and fewer sides. \\n\\nI was really happy with my experience here. The food was great, server was incredibly friendly, and it was an incredible value - I could not believe how low the prices were. My corner bar has a $26 burger that you can augment with $4 cheese and $6 truffled mushrooms (OK, that's a bit of an extreme example, but there's my point of reference!) so I was really happy that the most expensive burger here topped out at $17."},{"name":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews","address":"13000 N Interstate 35 Bldg","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Typical Red Robin fare.

I knew I was not going to be perfect (WLC is not about that anyway!) but I always try to study the menu trying to give it my best shot of eating highly fresh, low sugary foods without no bread/ pastas. I usually get a burger, hold the cheese, push the bun aside and substitute a salad or veggie instead of fries\\n\\nThis establishment had the most perfect delicious choice! (see photo/ i had to take a pic of the paper menu because I did not see it on their digital menu). In this salad I asked for the cheese to be left off and to add cold cut chicken. \\"No problem\\" our waitress said ( I am sure we were charged for adding the chicken but I did not see bill before my husband paid it) I love when staff can be so amenable to food substitutions. Easy peasy. Now, with a salad, most restaurants will add delicious, sugary, dressing, but not this one. The lemon \\"vinaigrette\\" was more like light olive oil and lemon  --all fresh and light tasting. The peas, ginger, mint and mesclun mix had these small blasts of flavor. It was awesome. And the pieces of chicken were fresh, no added sugar sauce added. A moderate amount so this dish is not for big eaters. Perfect for me.

Everything was really great! My favorites out of the tacos were the sesame ribeye, the fried oysters, and the wild boar. They all had great flavor and just enough sauce to give them some pep without drowning the taco. The rice bowls were really delicious too; they came with all of the mix-ins atop the rice so it was easy to pick out anything you didn't want and mix to your heart's content. The tamales were good but it was a struggle to finish when I wanted to gorge on more tacos!\\n\\nTheir drink menu has some fun choices and we all went with house margaritas. You could instantly tell they were made in house with fresh squeezed lime juice and a dash of sugar. It was really refreshing and paired well with the different dishes. The atmosphere at Bartaco is one of relaxation. It reminds you of the beach and is open and welcoming. They have garage doors they can raise in the spring and summer and plenty of outdoor seating. It's on my list to become a new hangout spot when you want some drinks and a few light bites in the summer evenings this year.

Even the music they play is remotely Indian. Except chicken tandoori legs which is served on buffets, everything is just okay. Their ambiance is good though. I once ordered chicken biryani, and they were worst biryani I ever ate-too hot and too spicy. Rest of the food was just plain okay. Buffet doesnt look much promising to me. During one of the Sunday buffet, they served gulab jamun which was of very low quality. Mango pudding was good. Tilapia fish on sunday brunch was also good. Kofta was very bad, in fact they used the same Kofta balls for the curry and aloo chat. Eggplant masala was overloaded with oil, but taste was good.

When I ordered the first thing I wanted I was given a total and told to please pull up even though I hadn't completed with my order nor did I give any indication that I was finished.

After they said they'd have the order out I asked Sham if I could please have two straws for my coffees. She straight up ignored me, she wasn't taking orders and I know she heard me plain as day.

I've heard mixed reviews for the place and didn't really know what pizza they were known for, so I just went with the classic Halwani's Supreme. I called in for take out, and it took about about 20 min.\\n\\nIt's pretty easy to miss this place, since it's on a side street off the main drag of downtown Grandview, but it's right behind/adjacent the old Giant Eagle. They have a sign out on the sidewalk of Grandview Ave as well which informs people that not only is the restaurant back in the alle,y but that they are known for their Tandoori Chicken pizza (whoops, guess I'll have to wait until next time). There is some seating in there, but you wouldn't be able to take a big party. \\n\\nThe pizza smelled amazing the entire drive home, and I had to keep myself from eating it in the car which was a good thing, because the slices were pretty flimsy, and I would have got it everywhere.\\n\\nI really really liked the taste of the pizza, especially the beef pepperoni and sausage mixed with the banana peppers. The crust was very crispy with nice flavor (I got the hand tossed crust which is an extra $.75), and the mushrooms were fantastic, probably my favorite part. My only gripe is the price is a little high at $14.99 for a medium, 12\\" pizza. I had no problem downing it on my own, and it definitely isn't big enough to share and actually be full. The next biggest size is the large at 14\\", which, depending on the pizza, hovers between $16-$19. I'm not sure if that'd be enough food for 2 or not.\\n\\nHalwani has a pretty large menu of specialty pies, subs, and strombolis, so I'm definitely going to swing back again and try one of these.

And to make matters worse I used to work in the industry for 8 years of my life, so I know what a rabbit hole Yelp can be for restaurants.  All of that said, I must say that my recent experience at Summer Shack near Alewife was really not great.  Monday, May 21st I checked in for a reservation for 3 and were given a very nice booth.  We had Ken, or the Ken show, which has already been extensively written about here so I needn't add more.    I will break this down into the good and the bad.   \\n\\nGood: Ken was nice and fairly attentive.  The R.I. Style Calamari was probably the best thing we had (although the portion was very small, and mostly surrounded by pickled banana peppers and jalapenos).   Desserts were very nice.  We had the Key Lime Pie and Indian Pudding. \\n\\nBad:  Despite Ken's exuberance his suggestions were not great.  He recommended the lobster potstickers as an additional app and I have to say they were pretty bad.  If there was lobster inside them, they were fishy and overall not appealing.  The Asian style slaw it was served with was bland.  As we progressed to entrees, we were recommended the Florida Red Grouper with roasted potatoes and a garlic Kale salad.  My fish was okay, a bit overcooked and charred to burnt in some places.  The potatoes were fine, although I had several seriously burnt ones (which some things burnt are okay, but not in this case!).  The kale which also was charred left an underdone stringent texture and was rather unappetizing.    I had also ordered a glass of wine with the meal from CA, a Sauvignon Blanc called \\"The Oyster\\".  It had been open too long and was passed.   All in all too, the bill was 150$.  I have to say at that price point, and Jasper's celebrity for fine cooking of fish, I was really disappointed. \\n\\nAs I said, I don't like to make a big fuss, but in light of the cost of the dinner and the overall quality of the food, I felt it worth writing a review."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Most fabulous total burger experience I've had.

I work right across the street from a KFC.  I've tried many different fried chicken restaurants, a few of which claim to be \\"the best fried chicken in Austin\\" (looking squarely at Lucy's), and I've always used KFC as the bar to which I compare because it's what I've always liked, and it's somewhat decent, and fairly cheap.\\n\\nWell, now I can't go to KFC anymore.  It's convenient, and it's cheap, and it's just across the street from work and easy to pick up on my way home to have a nice, relaxed lunch with the dog, but freaking Gus's has made it so that KFC is so incredibly subpar that I just can't stomach the thought of eating anything but Gus's.  \\n\\nThis is a problem, because Gus's is downtown, and I hate downtown.  \\n\\nThe food, though, is delicious.  The batter has some kick to it, it's not sopping wet with grease, the portions are big, and even the meat has seasoned, which is something most restaurants seem to miss entirely. \\n\\nThis chicken is hugely craveable.  Even the fried pickles, spears instead of slices and lightly fried instead of 10 parts batter to one part pickle, like every other fried pickle I've tried, are excellent.  \\n\\nNow, to another downside -- the dining area.  It's tiny.  There is room for maybe 50 some-odd people in there, and about half the tables put you elbow to elbow with strangers.  You will become intimately familiar with the day of the guy next to you.  I can handle it, but it's not necessarily enjoyable.  The person across from you, however, which is presumably the one you're interested in talking with, will be mostly garbled.  I'm saying it's very loud.  \\n\\nThe waitstaff was barely adequate.  They were friendly enough, but our drinks went empty multiple times, and stayed that way until we waved someone down.  I would say that I would prefer they have a drink station where we can just get our own, but with the congestion in this place, I don't think that would work very well.  \\n\\nIf Gus's had a location that was not downtown, I would eat a lot more, and probably gain 50 pounds within a few months.  \\n\\nSo maybe they're saving my life by having an annoying dining area and being downtown where I don't want to go.  Also, by being awesome, they have eliminated my visits to KFC, which also might help my health.  Either way, I feel like it should be my choice to commit suicide via fried chicken, and Gus's is robbing me of this choice, and that bothers me.

I dig the wood paneling that makes it look classy.  I like the game room upstairs with foosball, pool, and arcade cabinets.  I like the streetcorner patio where I have smoked many cigarettes.  It's good people-watching.  And the upstairs back patio as well.  \\n\\nI also could not help but notice the great selection of beers, and from what I hear, they have a Thursday special on beer.  They also have food specials.  Which is really the best time to go there, when things are cheap, because it can be a little pricey.  Service is usually decent, though.  \\n\\nThe absolute worst thing about this bar is the preppy, fratty dudebros.

Perfect amount of heat, completely different than Nashville hot chicken. The sides were pretty good - coleslaw wasn't too overloaded with sauce and mac and cheese and nice and creamy.

The place will fit probably only around 20 people and is run by chef Yuji himself and two waitresses. Simple, casual decor but not cramped. Service is a bit slow though because Yuji prepares basically everything by himself.\\n\\nWe started off with some Seaweed Salad, which we were a bit disappointed with. Since we knew the place was supposed to be pretty authentic, we thought the seaweed salad wouldn't be the ones that you get at the supermarket. Turns out it's just that typical stuff. Flavourwise, it was well seasoned and the seaweed was crunchy.\\n\\nFor salmon sashimi, they only sell Wild Sockeye Salmon here, so we ordered it anyways and it came with 9 pieces of sashimi. This was cut nicely and the fish was very fresh. The size were a little on the smaller size though (I feel like this picture makes them appear larger).\\n\\nWe also got an order of the Toro Sashimi. This had 5 pieces and the tuna belly was extremely fatty and melted in your mouth. However, I was disappointed with some of the pieces since they weren't cut properly. It was sort of like broken?\\n\\nWe also all had the Toro Nigiri which is a must order! Melt in your mouth sushi! So delicious! I also like how they already put wasabi inside. Oh and be sure to order this early, since most people will order this here. When we tried to put in a second order later in the evening, they were already sold out.\\n\\nWhat I really came here for were because I saw those pretty pictures of the gunkan. The Tobiko with Egg comes as your regular tobiko gunkan but topped with a raw quail egg. This tasted delicious! I remember trying this at another restaurant and not liking it, but I think it was because the quail egg wasn't very fresh. This was completely different and absolutely delicious. Crunchy and creaminess in your mouth at the same time. The Negitoro with Egg is the same concept and was also delicious and a must order. If you are not a fan of the raw eggs, then you can get them without as well for 50 cents less.\\n\\nWe got a few more of those after but K also tried the Mentaiko with Ika, which was on their daily special board. Mentaiko is marinated roe from pollock and cod, so some may find it fishy while others enjoy it. I thought it was interesting that they paired it with squid. K said it was pretty good.\\n\\nWe all had the Chopped Scallop Gunkan, which had big juicy scallops and the mayonnaise sauce wasn't too overwhelming.\\n\\nThe Tako Nigiri came with a bit of marinade sauce and the octopus was extremely tender and fresh. One of the best I've had. E and my dad enjoyed their Hamachi Nigiri which they also commented as being very fresh.\\n\\nE got the Aji Nigiri which had part of the skin attached to it but he didn't mind it. It seemed like he quite enjoyed this as well.\\n\\nI also got the Salmon Toro Nigiri, which the belly of the salmon. This was super smooth and creamy! I actually almost enjoyed this more than the regular salmon. We shared the Yuji Roll, which comes with a variety of fillings including tuna, salmon, and shrimp. Everyone enjoyed this roll.\\n\\nLast but not least, we finished off with the House Roll, which we ordered the full order. You can also get half an order. This again was filled with an assortment of fish. Although you know it's probably the ends of the sashimi, it was still very fresh and perfect for those who love sashimi.\\n\\nDinner ends off with a complimentary bag of Pocky for each guest. How cute! Overall, I was extremely happy with Sushi by Yuji. If you love traditional nigiris and fresh sashimi, this is the place to be. They barely have any cooked items here though, so don't be expecting any of that. You also won't find any of those creative rolls with tons of sauces on. Prices are a bit higher than most Japanese restaurant but are on par with Japanese owned restaurants. You may end up spending a bit more since they don't really have those filler dishes, but rather just mostly sushi. Although service was a bit slow, it was very friendly and Yuji even waved and thanked us as we left the restaurant. Small things like this makes a difference. I'll be back again soon!\\n\\nPros:\\n- Fresh sashimi and well-executed sushi\\n- Reasonable prices for authentic Japanese food\\n\\nCons:\\n- Wait for food to arrive is a bit slow due to only one chef"},{"name":"White Coconut Thai Restaurant","address":"211 Middlesex Tpke","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"The restaurant has a nice ambience for the kind of meal you would expect from a local Asian eatery.

I liked the American Breakfast better.  You have several options and I went with the egg over-easy, bacon, biscuit and hash browns.  The eggs and bacon were standard fare, the biscuit was tasty and the hash browns were nice and crispy.\\n\\nAtmosphere - There is a lot of seating with several tables inside a chaotic space.  It isn't easy to navigate between the coffee bar, the coffee fixings area (where you may or may not also find salt & pepper shakers) and unlucky you if your table is behind the short wall and line of people because it's not easy to navigate back-and-forth the narrow passage.

Blue Star was a let down, Publix Grocery donuts far surpass the flavor and quality of these.  We tried 4 different donuts and they were all nothing special.

Their patio is kick ass and has a very nice and lively vibe to it. For starters, the lentil sambusa is good. For main course I have had the vegetarian platter on numerous occasions which is a nice mix of all the vegetarian dishes they have served on a injera. The platter is enough for 2. \\nRecently I also tried the chicken tibs which was good too along with the vegetarian shiro; which is basically a chickpea stew. Again very good.

They never used liquid nitrogen to cool the shake like they did a few years ago. Then they tossed a few burnt marshmallow on top. We realized that the reason they were so warm is because they no longer use liquid nitrogen for the shakes.

I'll have you know that I am very much into nutrition and fitness, and always look to eat well. And yes, that includes the fried chicken here. They do not fry in partially hydrogenated oils like most of the restaurants in America. They use soybean oil...one of the healthiest oils you can fry with. Obviously you should always watch calories, but alas...I digress. (End health soap box rant). \\n\\nThere are 2 sizes of orders: Plenty and Generous, which is 2 and 3 extra sides, respectively. I ordered the Plenty serving of Fried Chicken breasts, Southern Collards with Ham, Green Beans with Potatoes. Yes...I had to throw veggies in to make myself feel even better about the meal since I had donuts this morning. Balance, right?\\n\\nLong story short...the flavors here are spectacular.

Opening this menu, however, came as a pleasant surprise. The prices were very reasonable. Our party of 4 ordered the white wine seasonal sangria (which I would highly recommend), 9-10 tapas to share, and churros for dessert. The more notable of the ones we tried were the broccolini, scallops, pork belly, and ceviche.

I also love the fact that they have spicy topping options. I usually go for the spicy fries, which are great, though they sometimes have a little too much salt and seasoning.\\n\\nA couple of notes: the burgers are huge: every burger is a double, so one is plenty for me. Same with the fries: one order is enough for two people, so I was glad on a recent trip that I didn't go for two orders for two people. What you don't want to know is that these burgers have about a million calories in them, so trust me, you don't want to be stuffing your face with potatoes for a whole afternoon just because your eyes were bigger than your belly.

The bathroom stalls are so tiny you have to squeeze behind the toilet in order to close and open them, and the doors stick - so beware, ladies!  I ordered General Tso's chicken, which certainly looked fantastic, presented like an expensive bistro - they know their presentation. But it was unfortunately bland and overly sweet; I've had better at fast-food Chinese.

I got the Classic with thin noodles and standard everything except a lot of spicy sauce (I'd get standard for this next time). I usually hate really salty things but the broth was really good with standard, I think getting anything less would've made the taste lacking. My bf got the sesame based one (goma?) and he thought it was good especially if you love sesame but he definitely preferred the classic. He also like how the dumplings were pan fried as opposed to deep fried, less greasy. Portions are smaller but still filling. The only thing I didn't like was the pork, thought it tastes bland. Service was quick and friendly, we ended up waiting around 15-20 mins for a table at around 12:20pm. The line up was significantly longer when we left at around 1:30.

I had no idea the restaurant existed as it shares a space with Sully's restaurant which has been in Milwaukie for about 15 years.  I asked my wife if we had plans for dinner Saturday night and she said \\"nope\\" so it was off to Gaucho's it was.  By the looks of other reviews I thought it might be smart to phone ahead and find out if reservations were needed.  The friendly lady on the phone said they had an opening at 7:30pm for three that night.  Perfect!\\n\\nWhen we arrived there was only one other table with 4 guests and the whole restaurant was otherwise empty.  The three of us arrived and were greeted by name(the name on the only reservations on their books so the possibility of calling the patron walking in with two in tow by the correct name was pretty high).  Love it still.\\n\\nWe were seated by the window and a nice pitcher of cold ice water with lemon in it was on the table.  Now I know how simple this sounds to you but my 10 year old daughter thought it was spectacular!  My daughter ordered Black bean soup, french fries and hot chocolate which she thoughtfully enjoyed every bite and sip of. \\n\\nMy wife and I ordered \\"the Parrilla Para Dos o mas! $49.95 Grilled meat variety for two or more... served in a portable grill; skirt steak, short ribs, hanger steak, sausage and chicken with famous \\"chimi-churri\\" sauce.\\"  and a couple of glasses of wine.  The wine arrived promptly and was very nice.  Next up was some piping hot homemade bread.  It was VERY good.  We asked out waitress if they make if fresh and she said yes the do bake it.  Although they buy it pre-made from franz and stick it in the oven.  Ha!  Just stop at yes, somethings I just don't need to know.  We certainly didn't have to wait long as our salad arrived at the same time a hot-sizzling portable grill came flying to our table.  I don't know why the salad was'nt served before the meal but oh well.  The flaming grill sizzling hot came running from the kitchen carried by a man with a grimacing look on is face as if he was holding the hot coals in his hands Nice Flair!  and it smelled really good.  No human burnt flesh smell thank God!  HA  \\n\\nEverything was yummy,  The chicken was juicy and the dead cow was delish.  A tad bit over salted for my taste but i am ubbr-sensitive to to much salt not their fault as I think most high end restaurants don't seem to add enough salt when it comes to beef.   The sausage was nice.  I don't think I've tasted anything like it.  Almost grainy/herby/meaty/yummyness if that makes any logical description at all.   \\n\\nWe will certainly be back.

There were hardly any customers at this location on a Sunday afternoon and it took over 15 minutes to get our order which were two Roast Beef plates. The order on both plates were exactly the same except minus the sauce on one.  One of the plates were incorrect and both had luke warm fries and onion rings.  When we advised the server, there wasn't an apology - she just took the food away and then discussed it with her fellow co workers who laughed  and looked over at our table.  They corrected the sandwich order but then forgot to include the fries and onion rings. Another worker came over, may have been a manager - but never introduced himself and asked if now everything was alright in a condescending tone.  When I explained it wasn't because they forgot the fries and onion rings he told me they would be right over, but never offered an apology.  All of the workers were hanging around and laughing and talking by the food area-this may be due to not a lot of customers on a Sunday afternoon, but this is no way to represent a company you are working for.

Probably, not much of value can really be added after the astonishing 300+ reviews.  \\n\\nWith a slight sort of gaudiness (Delano-esk), I thought the atmosphere actually felt casual enough, much more so than say Twist (admittedly a skewed sort of comparison.  or is it?).  Sure many of the customers looked like they were going to a nightclub, and the servers like they worked at one, but this neither took me (and shouldn't anybody) by surprise nor annoyed me too much.

The menu is creative, the details of which surely have been listed out many times on other reviews.  Venison, gyro, tartar, banh mi, what have you.  An A5 Kobe with a torchon of foie gras, for the wow factor and more expensive than a steak dinner.  Some interesting sides.  This is an attention-grabbing conceptual menagerie.  Blais is good at this.  If they only taste as impressive as they looked!  All the burgers I've tried (4~5 of them) ranged from decent to quite good.  The buns were very tasty.  The sweetbread nuggets were fried to death and tasted like nothing but buffalo sauce, while the fries and onion rings definitely were good.  Between the small portions and the fact that sides must be ordered separately, it's pretty expensive food.  Underwhelming overall but not bad.  Is there a winning dish, an obvious signature burger that you must order?  I didn't see one.  Maybe it's because I couldn't afford the A5, ha ha.    \\n\\nI'll give this place 4.5 stars though, if it just turns into a milkshake stop!  Almost all of the milkshakes, expensive they may be, are extremely rich and decadent, and quite unique.  Sweets gods like Sean M might have a more refined taste than myself and disagree.

Yes, grilled strawberries.  Who would have thought to prepare them that way, but the combination of sweet and smokey was a sensory revelation.

Maybe it depends which delivery service site you go through, but I ordered via Foodler, and my food has shown up RIDICULOUSLY fast. [I'm only a mile away, but I've generally found distance is pretty irrelevant with delivery-- sometimes, it just takes forever.] I'm on crutches, hence the frequency of delivery meals as of late, and the delivery guys have been very good-natured and friendly! \\n\\nI'd give 5 stars purely on the basis of the ludicrously fast delivery, but the food is awesome too! Over the last two deliveries, I've tried a pretty good sampling.\\n\\nVegetarian Sampler: The bomb. It came with--\\nVeggie pakoras (3-4?)= all awesome. \\nSamosa (1) = awesome. Love the hint of spice!\\nTikka and Paneer pakoras (2) = awesome. \\nAccompanying chutneys (tamarind chutney, mint chutney, and \\"pickle\\") = Delicious. Can I order buckets of those to put on my less-impressive home-cooked foods? \\n\\nRaita - Yeah, I know, it's \\"just\\" a condiment, but I ordered it a la carte. Really great! A little thinner than I was expecting, but with nice shreds of cucumber (and potato? That's new?) and a hint of mint. Really refreshing. I was a little hesitant to order it online, since I wasn't sure if I'd just get a tiny container, and it was 2 dollars by itself. BUT, I got an impressively-big tub! Definitely ordering a side of raita with all future orders.\\n\\nNaans - I have tried Garlic, Aloo Naan, and Pista Coconut Naan. The soft, warm, and moist texture of all three was awesome. Very filling, and generous portions. I (unlike everyone else who has reviewed, apparently) didn't love the Garlic Naan, as it was a little too \\"Woah, garlic\\" for me. The Aloo Naan might be a little dull by itself, but dipped into any of the accompanying sauces and condiments , it was delightful. The Pista Coconut was absolutely amazing-- maybe one of my favorite items. \\n\\nI would happily make a meal of any of the above appetizers, and will definitely order all of them again. Entree-wise, I haven't found an absolute favorite yet, but will keep trying. As a bonus, and as someone else mentioned, they give you a BIG container of fragrant, perfectly-done Basmati Rice with each entree. \\nThus far, I've tried:\\n\\nScallops Balti - This is one of the \\"modern\\" dishes on the menu. I like vegetables a lot, and I'll usually only order meat if it comes with a bunch of them-- so this appealed to me... lots of peppers, mushrooms, and onions. I ordered it \\"Very Spicy\\". The spice level was good, and the flavor was delicious, but it was a little heavy-- I thought a \\"veggies and seafood\\" entree would be nice and light, but it came in a big dousing of oil, which made the texture a little less than I was hoping for. \\n\\nPalak Paneer - Again, ordered \\"Very Spicy\\". This was much more up my alley. Packed with spinach-- definitely not \\"saucey,\\" it was thick and scoopable. It ALSO tasted very rich, almost too much so; but I kind of expect that, when I order a creamy-Paneer concoction. The flavor was fantastic. Paneer cubes were dense and tasty. \\n\\nSorry, this is a novel. But I wanted to give a shout-out to this place, as I've really enjoyed their food, and their lightning-fast-and-friendly service, while couped up at home with my gimpy foot. \\n\\nTLDR version: Order via Foodler if you want delivery, and ORDER THE VEGETARIAN PLATTER.

Though I'm often dubious of tapas as I've been burned all too often by the heartbreak of limp patatas bravas and pulpo lacking any hit of being done \\"a la plancha\\", given the rave reviews I'd heard from friends who had been to the Brookline and CT outposts, I was eager to allow myself to be tempted by this Spanish seductress.\\n\\nI'd been warned abt insane waits, so we rolled in at 5:15p on a Saturday night - and instead of being the youngest ones there by a solid 50y, as I expect when I dine at prime geriatric hour, the bar was already full-up with other youngish couples busy posting obligatory shots of the Iberico ham on Insta and downing their luscious cocktails. If I can impart any wisdom at all in this review it is such - get there effing early. By the time we left around 8p, the resto was full, the bar was 3 ppl deep (and +1 bartender on top, pouring shots into one lucky bride-to-be's mouth), and there was easily a 2.5h wait. It was a cluster. \\n\\nFirst, say yes to the bread and olive oil. It's warm, yeasty, soft perfection. Second, order everything you can fit in your body. Our favorites were the winter salad (pomegranate, quinoa, arugula, magic), squid w a heavenly chimichurri, crispy brussels w pickled onion, and roasted shrooms w herbed goat cheese.\\nPerhaps the only skips were the prawns a la plancha - bland, if a bit mushy, and the green olives were fine but not particularly luscious. Your tum space can be better filled. Though we didn't dive into the meat and cheese sitch, they have 18+ ways of ways to get your non-kosher dining on as well as 20+ more small plates to try.\\n\\nAlso, if you're not feeling like sharing, they have a few full sized entrees (chicken, branzino, pork, steak) as well as paellas. You can choose to save room for dessert as we did, hitting the dulce de leche crepas, which were drunk-yum, but with sober eyes, not actually worth it - chocolate sauce was too thick, crepa was a bit ham-fisted - and your night will be enjoyable regardless. \\n\\nGoing with as a group of 2-3 is probably for the best as the portions are such that  trying to serve more mouths will be a stretch. \\n\\nOh, obviously wine list is primarily Spanish, though a PN or a malbec can be procured if you're not swayed by the tempranillos and garnachas (which are yum, PS) - the real stars are the cocktails - the Whiskey Root (bourbon, ginger, basin, lemon juice) was all too easily downable, and any menu w a caipirinha is a win in my book - by the glass, vino is $8-12.5 and cocktails are $8.5-11. Worth the hangover. \\n\\nDecor is a mix of dark wood, retro office chic, and...something - I can't find a word to describe it, though it simultaneously works and is odd. Service needs to be improved. Friendly and knowledgeable but slow/absent. Plan on spending $50-70/pp, depending how badly you want it. Overall, hard yes to getting your catalan lisp on at Barcelona.

I have to admit that I have not yet had the opportunity to try an actual steak here but I was so impressed from my last two visits that I had to review.  I am definitely the type of person that likes to order a bunch of small plates or appetizers over just one main dish so I can try a little bit of everything.  We started with the corn chowder and it was more delicious than any corn chowder I have had.  It had this beautiful smoky flavor to it and the crab meat added a wonderful sweetness.  We then had the Ahi Tacos which were super fresh, very creative and lick your fingers yummy.  Next up was the Pimento Cheese Fritters with a delightful spicy chipotle dipping sauce and lastly we finished with the Cheesesteak Eggrolls and they were magical. \\n\\nWe went in for their brunch menu on New Year's Day and it was just as awesome as our dinner experience.

Eating out many evenings in a row along the restaurants on Rue Mouffetard in Paris, maybe I'd been spoiled. But I'd heard that this was one authentic French bistro in Vancouver! \\n\\nFor appies our Alsaciene Tarte Flambee was possibly the best thing I had that evening. (So just get this and drinks - the bartender is pretty cool!---and leave j/k) The escargots lacked flavour and were just a bit chewy and heavy with butter - which I usually like- but this I'd skip next time. We also had the scallops...which cooked nicely but were tasteless and covered in maybe a bechamel and cheese. \\n\\nMy main was the Canard Confit...and the duck was juicy, skin fairly crispy, and the sauce was pretty amazing. The escargots were so heavy as an app I was too full to enjoy most of my main. And thought I should leave room for dessert and tea/coffee.\\n\\nThe experience to this point was 3.5 stars...to be nice as it was my first experience. But seriously, the waiter swooped in, took our plates and quickly brought us the bill. Really...no dessert menu...no coffee or tea offered? Really??? Kind of a basic faux pas? I don't get upset too easily, but really...I was pretty annoyed. [LFB - please ask your customers if they want dessert - all of them!]\\n\\nWe had the later seating time so there were no other customers waiting to be seated. Another waiter kindly came over to fill our water glasses and by that time I was so annoyed at the other waiter that I didn't have the energy to ask for the dessert menu, but asked for a cup of tea.

Once we checked in, we were seated promptly. As we settled into our seats, menus were handed to us individually. Since Barcelona is a Spanish tapas dinner experience, we agreed to order various dishes to share among the table. The first order of business was starting up with a pitcher of traditional white sangria for the table. Made with pineapple juice, rum , brandy and orange liqueur, the white sangria was sweet and light, which provided plenty of room to savor the dishes to come.\\n\\nThe first to arrive was a basket of bread, which I highly recommend to scoop up any remaining sauces in the dishes. Since tapas is usually served as they are prepared, our dishes arrived two at a time, which gave us time in between to enjoy the moment and clear the table.\\n\\nThe first to arrive was Patatas Bravas (salsa brava, garlic aioli) and Spicy Eggplant Caponata (served cold with basil and parsley). Although small, they packed a ton of flavor and the sauces were absolutely divine. I especially loved the salsa brava and the eggplant caponata could have easily worked as a spread with toasted bread. I'm telling you, bread is absolutely necessary!\\n\\nNext, we had Crispy Pork Belly with a spicy tomatillo salsa, Mussels al Diablo in a spicy tomato sauce and Grilled Broccolini with a truffle vinaigrette. The broccolini had a lovely char, but was a bit on the salty side. It may not be the best thing on its own, but it paired nicely with the crispy pork belly and bread. The crispy pork belly was portioned perfectly for our group since it came with five to a dish, but the spicy tomatillo salsa was absolute money. I couldn't help but soak up the sauce with bread.\\n\\nThe last of the tapas was Champinones al Ajillo (foraged mushrooms with garlic) and Migas (chorizo and toasted bread topped with a fried egg). The foraged mushrooms were a medley of oyster, chanterelles, cremini and others I can't identify. \\n\\nTo wrap up our meal, the final serving was brought out. We ordered the Paella Mariscos enough for two servings, which easily filled us all after a few rounds of tapas beforehand. The paella was topped with prawns, mussels, clams and squid with Saffron rice. Absolutely divine and I feel it's a must-try at Barcelona. Aside from seafood, they also offer a vegetarian (asparagus, broccolini, fava beans) or meat (chorizo, sausage, pork belly) option for paella.\\n\\nIf you're going to come through for dinner, I highly suggest or dare I say, reservations are REQUIRED on weekends.

These were quite lovely and different. Plump, fresh and the cumin-yogurt I think really was beautiful with it.\\n\\nBaby Maine Calamari\\nThese were very good. Similar to the kind I make at home...super light with only a hint of crisp - no heavy breading, the squid itself, meltingly tender. Well done.\\n\\nSaganaki (pan fried cheese)\\nThis was overwhelmingly salty, rich and warm. I loved it. The build up on our palates from the meze in this order peaked here.\\n\\nBraised Rabbit mousaka \\nAnd the crescendo descended. This dish was light and creamy...but that is kinda all you could taste...there was a nuance of nutmeg floating about, but by this time in our dinner, our tastebuds had been focusing on bright, acidic lushness...and this dainty lactic dish could not compete. I would serve this earlier in the meal if one hoped for proper praise of it.\\n\\nLambchops (3day marinade, wood grilled, oregano, tzatziki and greek fries)\\nVery good. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Mine was better than the husbands. It was smaller and burst with flavor. I admit I gnawed the bone a bit (I NEVER do this, not even with ribs).

From there we tried the grouper corn dog which was crisp and had a light garnish underneath of chickpeas and some type of tasty sauce. The last thing we got off the happy hour was the soft shell crab which was tempura battered, the waitress brushed a lemon type sauce to coat it once the plate was set down. Probably one of my favorites just because the flavor profile is so interesting! Lastly the goat cheese cheesecake was more goat cheese then cheesecake flavored obviously, garnished with peaches, granola, and a drizzle of some type of syrup.

The proportion of cake to icing was very nice.   The icing was impressive...the marshmallow could have used something to cut the cloying sweetness, but finding a real, gooey, chunk of marshmallow in it was a nice touch.  The butter cream was a pretty, bright blue color, a nice mix of sweet and creamy...not the best I've ever had, but I'd go back for another.

The chocolate cupcakes were moist and textually impressive but their flavor just didn't compare-it had very much the \\"Betty Crocker Box Mix\\" flavor to it.   The vanilla on the other hand, left me feeling disappointed.  The cake itself didn't have the appealing mouth feel of the chocolate nor did it have anything that made me think \\"This is the best vanilla cupcake I've ever had.\\"  Both cakes felt kind of generic.   \\n\\nI'd go back to Yum Yum for the icing-I'd get two cupcakes and a spoon, eat the icing and toss the cake.

The friendliness of the staff and everyone inside is extremely Texan, southern hospitality at its finest. The beer is ice cold, cheap, and best of all local. The food is served cafeteria style almost, each serving is 2$ per 5oz. Sides include green beans, cream corn, mac n cheese, cornbread, ranch beans, mexican rice, and a peach cobbler. Meats are brisket, Turkey, sausage, jalapeno cheese sausage, pork ribs, and giant beef ribs. The my gf and I tried almost all the sides sans mexican rice which seemed out of place with bbq but looked delicious, the mac and cheese is the clear favorite with maybe cream corn as a far second. The meats are served by the 1/4# 1/2# 1# with varying prices. The brisket is served either fatty or lean depending on choice, we choose lean and it was flavorful, a bit salty but a nice smoke flavor, the jalapeno sausage was not any different from a store bought variety and not very tasty, or worth the price. The beef ribs are Texas sized in every manner, appearance, flavor, price, fat, and bone. My gf wanted the beef instead of pork ribs so we settled on it. It was cooked very well in terms of tenderness, but again the issue of Texas saltines really hits you. Another issue besides paying money for bone, was the amount of fat on it really doesn't sit well, yes I know fat is flavor, but it was almost 60/40 fat ratio. Instantly made me regret getting them in lieu of the pork. With all this being said, their homemade bbq and picante sauces are really solid, the atmosphere is very quaint and homey, with little knick knacks for sale in the front and very rustic signs on the wall makes me want to come back and try it.

Put it back and don't ever take it off again! I miss it so much! Like if everything else on your menu is heavenly, then the dbar was God. You killed God! Heaven is lonely without him.

It had a great crisp and the meat was moist, but I wasn't feeling it. The plus side was that it wasn't too greasy like other fried chicken joints (i.e. KFC, Church's, Hartz, etx) Although, I don't think anything really tops Popeye's chickens.

I have recommended this place to many people over the years. I have also brought guests there, and have enjoyed many dinners there w/ our extended family. \\n SO that is why it pains me to have to write about a recent negative experience. \\n My family of 6 (2 adults/4 kids) were headed out to catch a movie a few nights ago and decided to stop by Dagabi's to eat first.  I walked in around 5:30 and was cheerfully greeted by the hostess. I told her we had 6, and she proceeded to look at her little map of tables. At this point my 4 kids walked in. She looked at them, then suddenly asked me if I had a reservation. I told her no and she said that it would be over an hour wait. This was surprising to hear because there were a whole lot of empty tables inside and out on the patio.  When I asked her about all the empty tables she said that they were ALL reserved. This was surprising as well. Usually restaurants save a certain amount of tables for walk-ins....anyhow I decided to use my OpenTable app to see if I could make a reservation. I was able to make one for 6:00. \\nI went back inside to inform the hostess that  know had a reservation. I had to wait for her to finish speaking with a couple of parties that had just walked in, and I noticed that she did not tell either of those parties about any \\"wait\\" even though neither of them had a reservation....when it was my turn and I told her about the reservation I was able to make, she just stood there looking at me w/ a deer in the headlights look.\\nEventually a man came to assist her and he told me that he would\\" try\\" to seat us. \\nUnfortunately at this point we didn't have enough time to eat before our movie, so we declined. Very annoying. \\nAs I said before I have always liked this place so I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was just a fluke...new employee? confusion?  The next day I wrote an email to Dagabis detailing what happened and asking them to kindly explain why we were treated that way. Are they not \\"kid friendly\\" anymore? Well, they never even replied, which IMO speaks volumes. Apparently they don't appreciate their customers....too bad for them they just lost an EXCELLENT customer.

Some like Salmon but I prefer the white fish. \\nThen choose your bread -obviously I can only recommend what I have tried. \\nInjera is the custom and Ethiopian bread is absolutely fantastic. \\nInjera is a spongy almost crepe-thin bread made from Teff flour. \\nIt has an almost sour taste that you enjoy from sourdough but the texture is divine and they roll the thin pieces into logs and serve them on the side. \\n\\nUse the bread to soak up juices, add some spice and if you feel like it, pick up meats by hand.\\n\\nYou also get options for vegetable sides. Some favorites of mine- collards, spicy red lentils, potato stew, beet and potato salad, yellow split pea. \\n\\nAsk for a side of Mitmita or Awaze (ah-wah-zay) for extra seasoning and a punch of spice that'll clear out your sinuses. \\n\\nYou cannot go wrong with Desta!

Fifteen bucks?!?! For something like chicken tikka masala? No. No no no.Try again.\\n\\nThat mindset may have been what screwed me over, though. I got samosas and mulligatawny soup because those were the two things on the menu that seemed reasonably priced. The samosas were good, but the soup left me wanting -- it was sort of a potato-ey flavored water. Good spices, sure, but I felt like I must be missing something. And it was so tiny! If the rest of the soups were that small, I'd be very hesitant to order them just based on quantity. (Also, re the samsosas, I know a few other places on Harvard Street that I can get samosas for less than $2 a piece.)\\n\\nThe delivery time was the other concerning bit. I don't know exactly how long we waited, but I'm pretty sure it was at least well over an hour, perhaps nearing two, before our disappointing food was finally delivered. They don't charge a delivery fee, so at least I didn't feel bitter that I had to pay for a delivery that I could have picked up myself much faster; instead, I just felt hungry.\\n\\nSo, I dunno.

We knew exactly what they advertised, but their staff had absolutely no idea what was going on. \\n\\nFirst of all, we got there a few minutes before our reservation and were asked to wait briefly for our table. Sure, no problem, we've waited for reservations before. Cue the cronies of one of the staff coming in and being seated right away (with the same number of people in their group). Now it's 8:35, another group arriving after us has been seated, and we're still standing near the door. \\"Two minutes\\" turns into ten more minutes. Everyone's reservation was at 8pm (they had a 6pm seating and an 8pm seating, according to their advertisement) so there was no reason at all for the groups before us to be seated right away while we stood around. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the bouncer/doorman who's chatting with us is very confused by our inquiries about the dancing from 10pm-2am, we were asking about it because we didn't see where the dancefloor would be. He told my husband directly that we're supposed to leave after dinner and then come back later after the 10pm people were done eating, \\"maybe go to Mija or somewhere in Faneuil?\\". Buddy, it's 5 degrees out and I'm wearing a dress and heels, do I look like I want to walk over a mile to Faneuil Hall when I paid to stay here and dance after dinner? When my friend and I questioned him because we made the reservations and knew what was advertised, he rebuked my husband for saying that we had to leave and said that's not what he said at all, \\"of course we'd never ask you to leave,\\" but that there's no DJ and no band, just background music that gets turned louder, and the dance floor is this nice empty 3ft-wide space between the tables and bar that you see right now as they clear a few tables away. Hmmm....\\n\\nFinally we are seated, prosecco bottle is brought over right away, poured and put into their ice sink a few steps away. Nobody ever came back to see if we needed more, so my friend eventually took it upon herself to go get the bottle and top us all off. About an hour later the waiter realized that the bottle wasn't where he left it and said we should have told him we needed refills. Don't get me wrong, he was a nice guy, funny, but an AWFUL server. We didn't get our orders in for another hour and by the time we were eating it was 10:30, I kid you not. The champagne toast they advertised? He didn't know we were supposed to get it, and my friend insisted that he bring it over, so we were literally in the 10-second countdown to midnight when he brought some plastic flutes over.\\n\\nThe food was better than we expected it to be--raw seafood plate for two was good sized, white peppered tuna with mushrooms and creamed spinach was all delicious, and our friends' lamb and short rib were both good as well. Chocolate mousse was a weird texture and too salty for my taste but the banana upside down cake was great.\\n\\nThe service in this place is some of the worst I have ever experienced, which was such a disappointment because the view is beautiful and the fireworks took place right there in front of us which was nice, not to mention the food actually was good.\\n\\nCome to find out, the doorman suggested Mija because it's owned by the same people--that makes sense because Mija is the other place with the worst service I've ever experienced! It all finally made sense...\\n\\nWhat a shame.

It has a one-way entrance off of Howell Mill westbound, otherwise, it's accessible off of Ponce de Leon Place.  None of that really matters because at any given time of the day, it's going to be packed full, you're going to get flustered in your car, the chance of a fender bender is high since people illegally park in front of the dumpster and the retaining wall, making a small lot smaller, and there's a good chance you simply get mad and leave, or settle for parking in the beat up lot across the street and hoof it across a busy street.  And even when you get there, the time it took you to park your car, the line has gotten extended to the door, and sometimes out it.\\n\\nI hate to sound so trite about parking, but on repeated visits, it's often the same miserable, discouraging result.  How Chipotle seems to have the favor of burrito lovers is a mystery to me, when there are more Willy's, which are typically easier parking situations and IMO better quality food.

I had a pulled pork sandwich ($11) that was about as good as it gets around here.  One of my only complaints is that my first beer came in a full-sized pint glass, but the next two came in the smaller Sam Summer glasses.

One of the people in our group had just returned from a semester in Barcelona and said that the ones served at Barcelona Wine Bar were better than most she had had there!

I don't think that I would ever go back to Boston without returning to Barcelona!!!!\\"\\n\\nOriginal review:\\nNot sure how the food or service is here because we never had the chance to find out. Called on Monday to book a reservation for a party of 11 for Friday night. Left a message, they returned my call, all good. Friday comes, I call to change time and they have no record of my reservation! It's in my call log so I know it's the same restaurant(not the North one like he suggested). Trying to get a place in Boston to take a party of ten last minute is no easy feat. He was apologetic but that didn't help. Definitely same voice that took the reservation btw.\\n\\nEdit-I'm editing this review a little late. They contacted me apologizing, asking us to come in and they'd make it up to us. While it was a special occasion with people coming from four different states for dinner there is no way we can recreate that. A week later they called to confirm the reservation, it was then we realized they had put us in for the wrong date.

It pains me to write this because this was one of my favorite park restaurants but, after the way that Amamda (Hostess) and Mike (Manager) treated us, I will never go back. It not only affected our day because of hunger but, ruined it by setting a tone not like anything you'd expect at Disney. My wife gave her name on standby line and waited patiently for a table. Prior to taking our youngest daughter to the bathroom, my wife asked how much longer, so she could gauge her time in the bathroom. The hostess, Amanda, told her \\"5 to 10 min\\". So my wife figured that gave her enough time to use the restroom. I came over to the front hostess stand soon after or about 5 minutes from the time Amanda said \\"5 to 10\\". Apparently, lots happens in 5 min in Animal Kingdom because they all edged to have called us twice and sat two tables in our place waiting for us. Amanda basically told us that now we would have to wait another 30-45 min because \\"we missed our turn\\". Talk about splitting hairs and then ruining a Disney Day. It gets better. The sit us down after all the dilemma only to kick us out of the table as they never intended to give us the table. Instead, their solution was to split up my family in to two tables. Wait, there's more. Mike, the Manager came over to supposedly help but, I guess he was either outranked by Amanda or didn't care about satisfying long time Annual Pass Holders. Amanda came back and gave us attitude (something unseen in Disney) and said to us as if we were children, \\"do you want to eat here or not?\\". At that point my wife, who is typically soft spoken, showed her the time stamp from her phone when she said 5 to 10. She basically called us liars. Again, we were cool right until Amanda started with her attitude. She was condescending and short sighted. I mean, seriously, this foul woman wouldn't budge. Mike was no help either.

If you think that craft brew and artisanal cuisine should go together like brie and sancerre, well, you've come to the right place. If you think that's all a bunch of pretentious foppery, then you should probably stay closer to the food trucks on E.6th. I think that the place is worth it, but readily admit that the concept isn't going to be for everyone. And that's okay.\\n\\nLike gastropubs in general, Hi Hat features small bites at not-so-small prices. You're looking for quality over quantity here, and, for my money, Hi Hat delivers: the duck confit nachos, for example, are $14. This is, in nearly everyone's opinion, a hell of a lot to pay for a nacho appetizer of any variety at all. But it's also a savory mouthful of rich, fatty wonderful, with the salt of the nachos and the acidity of the pickled poblanos a great match for the duck itself. It's the perfect starter to chase down with a rich porter or smoky quad. There are typically daily specials as well: we recently did a spicy quail app (tiny but glorious) with regular sides brussels sprouts and mac 'n cheese (both tasty). The meal I just described with one drink each pushes $60 for two out the door, a ticket which essentially separates those who like this idea from those who don't.\\n\\nHappy hour during the week offers some price relief (cheap pretzels and other apps as well as discounted wines and beers), so it's a nice intro to Hi Hat for the unsure. As other reviewers have noted, the bartenders could be a bit more friendly (and the bar-only ordering seems a little down-market for this concept), and as the price of small-batch food, things run out fairly often. The patio is also located at a busy intersection and not especially removed from pedestrian traffic. I'll concede all of this, and still say this is easily one of the better places to get a meal and a drink Downtown."},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped here for the first time on the way to a Bruins game on New Year's Eve to use my Phantom Gourmet gift card.

There were 12 of us so they put us in Christophers next door. We were the only ones in the building and it was very quiet. They had roses on the table but sadly they were dead.  They had an old school boom box in the corner so we asked for music. They said they would start it but didn't. After 20 minutes we started it ourselves. The cd skipped so we ended up without music anyway. The server was more than rude. They didn't give us enough menus, when they brought water they were several short and it took quite a long time to correct it. The server acted very unhappy and one of my friends even commented she felt like a child scolded and sent to her room. We were left completely alone most of the time. We finally ordering and received our food which some didn't enjoy at all. The meat was under cooked for two people but they were afraid to say anything for fear of repercussions. The server came in after our entrees were delivered and despite a few of us asking about desert he insisted we get our check instead. We would have left but we really wanted to see the belly dancer. We confirmed she would come to our building but after dinner came and went and our checks being processed there was little hope. As we were gathering or things to leave she walked in.  Over an hour after the time we expected her. However she was great. Really amazing. Saved the entire night. After she did the sword dance she convinced one of the teenagers to give it a try. That started a dominoes effect and in the end every one of us had gotten up and tried or hand at belly dancing. I wouldn't recommend any large party go here. They treat you like the plague.

Think of Santa's factory... but with people mass producing tacos on this huge grill.  One to grill tortillas, one to cook meat, one to assemble... it's genius... pure genius...  Sadly, I felt like a retard when I ordered because I couldn't pronounce these North Pole goodies... actually South of the Border, but remember... I'm making an analogy to Santa's factory.\\n  The offerings here are somewhat like Santa's factory as well... actually providing authentic Mexican tacos, though they aren't prepared to the best of quality.  Not necessarily free, but pretty reasonably priced.  3-4 should fill you up.\\n  My first... the cochinita pibil: orange roasted pork with pickled onions.  Moist pulled pork, with the texture just as soft and light as BBQ pulled pork.  Overall, a great taco, but lacking a certain punch.\\n  Round two... tinga de pollo: tomato braised chicken.  This wasn't much more than seasoned pulled chicken, and there's so much more you can do with moist chicken meat.  Could use more seasoning, but the vegetables and such on top were nice and crisp.  Ok taco.\\n  Third and final taco... the downfall, Picadillo taco:  to sum up the taco... Taco bell ground beef with potatoes... nothing more.  Decide for yourself how this one was... go to Taco bell, and order a soft beef taco.  Add potatoes.  You got yourself El Chilito's Picadillo taco for 79 cents.\\n  So, all in all, average taco joint, but the dark roasted salsa they offer is something special and different.  Not great, but a change from the everyday roja salsa.  They also do their tortillas soft and gently... not soggy, which is a plus!  Oddly, their water is a bit \\"gamey\\" tasting.  I might add that with all of the taco spots I have hit up as of late, their water has been being judged... by me.

Even though this does not apply to every Japanese restaurants, the food should have not have been as bad as what they served me and my friends. If you ruin an egg, TWICE, then you're doing something wrong. Not all the so called 'food' there is bad. I ordered a miso soup, and that was pretty good, but the ramen my friends and I ordered were not good at all. We all agreed that this was a bad, if not the worst, restaurant ever. If we all went down a couple blocks to a Vietnamese or Chinese restaurant, we would have had more food and food that would have tasted 2x better than what we have gotten. The ramen at this restaurant was at least $10 (I believe it was exactly $13), but we would have gotten a better deal ordering noodles at another restaurant for $7-$8.

With four tables to its name, dine in is an option, but take-out seems to be the norm.  If you want something quick, their prepared food counter is ready to scoop from.  Otherwise, things seem to be made to order here.\\n\\nThey advise 30 minutes for their Mofongos on their menu (with alternatives the dofongo and trifongo also available), but it turns out their Jibarito (and the sweet plantain variation, the Jibarita) should also be allowed 20 min.\\n\\nSince we wanted both, I ordered those first and asked them to get started on them before I completed my ordering and paying.  That worked out pretty well, as we noshed on our Frituras/Fritters as we awaited the main course(s).\\n\\nThe Alcapurria $2 (grated root vegetable fritter stuffed with ground beef) looked rather small when it was placed in the plastic serving basket, so I selected another item on the fly, which it turned out was not mentioned at all on their menu.  It was yellow and described as a sweet cornmeal with cheese.  I like corn, I like sweet, and I like cheese, so I went with it.\\n\\nThe alcapurria was a bit disappointing, as it was not to my taste.  The crust was a rough, nutty sort of texture, which overwhelmed the meat filling.  The Sorullos $1.25, sweet cornmeal with cheese, on the other hand, was as described, so I quite enjoyed it.  My friend called it a corn dog, thought it was without any dog.\\n\\nAt $1.25, for liquid refreshment, we picked up can of guava nectar from the refrigerated case.  It was quite rich and nicely chilled.  In addition to other fruity flavors and water, they oddly carried Pepsi-Cola on the same rack as the Sprite.\\n\\nThe Jibarita with Steak/Bistek $6.95 arrived neatly portioned for two, though the soft texture of the \\"bread\\" (being sweet plantains) made it more of a knife & fork type of dish than the sort of thing you can eat with your hands.  We got it with everything but the hot.  The contrast of textures with crisp lettuce and potato sticks tucked in was great, and the flavor was slightly reminiscent of a Big Mac due to the sauce and the beef as the protein of choice.  Don't expect large pieces of beef here - it is rather sliced up the way folks might for a steak and cheese sub.\\n\\nThe Mofongo with pernil/roast pork $8.50 arrived not long after.  Mofongo is a savory dish that combines green plantains mashed with fresh garlic.  It had a good flavor, and was not too dry like another I had taken with me on a plane once.  The roast pork was tender and tasty.  I later spotted one of the workers enjoying the shrimp variation on her dinner break, and saw a goodly number a decent sized shrimp resting on her mound of mashed plantains.  For $9.99, it seemed a steal.\\n\\n4 stars\\n\\n*** 6/2016 dinner again ***\\n\\nI came back for dinner another night to try their Jibarito (that's the sandwich using fried plantains (platano verde) as the bread).  It was $6.95 for the Pernil/Roast Pork version.\\n\\nIt was about 12 minutes from paying a the counter to delivery to my table.  And when it arrived, sure the plantains were sturdier than the sweet version, but gee, were they hot for my poor finger tips!  Maybe these are just plain better eaten with the knife and fork as were provided to me...\\n\\nThe pork in this jibarito were not as tender and moist as on the first visit served on the mofongo.  It was also a tad drier a concoction this time around.  Wait!  I realize what the difference was - it didn't come with the sauce and cheese!  Both times I agreed to have it with everything but the spicy... do they make it different based on the type of meat and the plantain selection, or did they just plain forget?\\n\\n2 stars\\n\\nPS - I don't like coconut water.

There were not all that many people eating and there were only two or three other people sitting at the bar. As it was a workday and I'm not inclined to have alcohol with my lunch, I ordered a Mexican coke with my meal. \\n\\nWhen the bill came, in addition to my food and drink cost was a \\"non alcohol beverage tax\\" of $3. I have talked to friends who are/were servers and no one has heard of such. I think tacking on a $3 \\"tax\\" (is it even legal to call it that?) to a meal that cost $13.50 is OUTRAGEOUS. After the +20% tip I left my server, my bill was over $20 for a few small tacos, guac and a coke. I won't be going back here because I found that to be tacky and of the three other taco restaurants I frequent in this area, not one ends up being over $20 for lunch. And while this food was good, it was nowhere near worth $20.\\n\\nAs far as I know, Georgia has no such tax and I really have no way of knowing whether my server just didn't like me and came up with this, or it's a restaurant policy. I understand that the bartenders should get higher tips when people are ordering alcohol, but it wasn't as though I was keeping a drinker from being able to sit in my seat as they were NOT busy, so had I not been there to inconvenience the bartender of handing me a soda and taking the piece of paper my order was on, she would've gotten zero tip. Again, not blaming the server because she did a fine job, just don't know where this \\"tax\\" came from.

Because it is so fresh the glazes were still soft & gooey and not hard or crunchy at all.  Our favorite was by far the Chocolate Crunch (I don't think that is the full actual name but it's the one with little chocolate crunchies on top, dipped in chocolate and has a custard filling) - the chocolate it is dipped in is high-quality stuff!  Second fave was the jelly donut with I believe Marionberry filling and Peanut Butter Powder coating - like a grown up version of a PB & J sandwich!  The Bourbon Blueberry Basil was good but mostly tasted like Blueberry, I would have liked more basil in the glaze.  The Hard Cider Apple Fritter is HUGE with big chunks of apple in it.

We get seated and order just after 6:30 he does good at getting our appetizer out quick but then he went pretty M.I.A. and we have to flag someone down because everyone's drinks were empty. They apologize saying they were short staffed people called off last minute etc... that's fine the guy was really nice. Then 7:30 comes around we ask the manager why our food hasn't come out yet it's been an hour since we ordered and an hour and a half after we arrived. She explained they were short staffed again and that there were managers in the back cooking instead of the cooks... alright... so we wait and food doesn't come out till just after 8 PM. The food, mediocre. The prime rib was waaaaaay over cooked well done when she ordered medium rare, no pink at all was very tough. My steak was over cooked but edible. At this point we had been there too long we didn't want to wait for them to recook it so they took it off the bill and apologized. We then get two cakes (we're celebrating both my dads and my grandmas birthday) and one was soft and warm while the other one was frozen solid. At this point we're done we don't complain again since it feels like a broken record. A few years ago this place was great but last few visits have been horrible.

The sauce that came with was beautifully drizzled on and just spicy enough without being too overwhelming. \\n\\nDeep fried short rib - freakin' delicious! I expected a little meat, a big bone in the middle and lots of fried batter on the outside. What I got was two beautiful pieces of meat, a little crispy on the outside and mouthwateringly tender on the inside. It came with a yam puree that was a great accompanyment and was good both with the short rib and on its own. \\n\\nChocolate Cheese Cake - It was very good. Fresh raspberries! I was stuffed and can only handle so much rich chocolate, but it was delicious. \\n\\nOur server was fantastic. As was the waitress that brought us drinks while we waited for our table.

This was our late night go-to dinner spot. Like any other restaurant, when you arrive late the food is mediocre. So we knew what we were getting into when we came in 45 min. to closing, but because we went here so often we already knew what we wanted prior. On this particular night we ordered the lobster dumplings, sushi, stir fry, & the beef braised noodles. Other than the 2 min. put together sushi everything was great! Until... we got the beef braised noodles. After 2-3 bites I discovered the LONGEST & thickest strands of hair in my broth. I was mortified. I'm the kind of person who gets embarrassed to complain about something I don't like when it comes to restaurant food, but this was something I could just not express. I felt bad for telling the waitress about the hair(s). I could tell she was embarrassed as well & probably just as grossed out. Because of that incident & the fact that they only gave us a discount instead of just taking the dish off I will sadly never go back to that place."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I visited Barley Swine a few weeks ago with a friend after my husband had recommended I try it. As the place did not take reservations, I called ahead of time (on a Saturday) to see when they start getting busy. I was told 5:45...So we arrived a 5:50 and it was already a 45 minute wait for 2 people! We were in no hurry so we each ordered a glass of wine and sat outside to enjoy the nice weather. There really isn't a very comfortable waiting area unless you're able to snatch up one of the few tables outside. Otherwise it's either stand inside or outside.\\n\\nIt didn't seem very long before we were seated at the \\"bar\\"/kitchen counter, and I absolutely loved our clear view of the kitchen. The ambiance was very nice in the restaurant. It was obviously busy but not loud and just very relaxed. All the staff always had a smile and overall it was very pleasant. Our waitress (although I don't think this is the right title to use for her as she did many other things...) greeted us from the other side of the counter, poured us our water and introduced the dishes. I liked that she spoke to us from the other side of the counter so neither my friend or myself had to turn around had she spoke to us from the same side of the counter. \\n\\nThere were a few specials that night and we ended up ordering the following items (to share):\\n\\nBeets, shallot yogurt, grilled arugula, crispy potato, cured yogurt (special) - this was absolutely my favorite for the night. The beets were fresh and sweet it balanced the saltiness of the potato chip, the shallot and yogurt were perfectly flavored and not overpowering, and the arugula had the perfect texture and taste. I was so tempted to order another one so I did not have to share with my friend\\n\\nChicken fried chicken egg, green garlic grits, romanesco - this was my friend's favorite. I mean, who doesn't like fried chicken, but fried chicken egg?! The flavors meshed together so well, great texture with just the right amount of salt\\n\\nGoat, walnut, kohlrabi, fenugreek, wild rice, green garlic - this was both of our favorite and probably the best goat I've ever had. It was not gamy at all and it was so perfectly cooked and cubed that you didn't need a knife to cut it and if my friend wasn't still dreaming about the fried chicken egg she just had, I know I would have had to fight the third piece from her\\n\\nLamb, sunchokes, goat cheese, grapefruit, spinach, cumin - between the lamb and the goat, the goat wins, but that's not to say the lamb wasn't good. It's just that...the goat was so good I don't remember much about the lamb\\n\\nPig, crispy ankle, sauerkraut, beans, mustard - this was our least favorite dish. I wasn't crazy about the any of the three different pork on the plate, and I don't know why, the dish felt very German to me, but then it's not like I've ever been there, so I probably don't know what I'm talking about\\n\\nDuck, foie gras, carrot, lavender, farro, hibiscus - I was very excited about this dish because I love foie gras, and it was excellent. The flavor of the duck was very good as well although the over taste of the dish seemed Asian and the sauce on the bottom was so salty we actually didn't finish eating the duck. \\n\\nOur dessert was also a part of that night's special, carrot cake with carrot ice cream and carrot marshmallow. Everything was orange. The cake was spongy with nothing inside, which my friend really enjoyed although I think I prefer the traditional carrot cake.\\n\\nOverall I was very happy with my experience and would recommend the place.

Other than that, I got not a word of apology for such bad service in Valentine's Day, or understanding--only a condescending silent treatment.

I had eyed Rangzen on my visits to the Cambridge Public Library, and have been very curious what Tibetan food would be like ever since. They seated us after just 5 minutes. Win!\\n\\nWell, this particular Tibetan food was... OK. Just OK. I'd give it 2.5 stars. For starters, we shared two types of bread. One was plain with just a little butter, and the other, superior, looked more like a wrap - vegetables baked into the crepe-like outside and wrapped around other veggies. As for my entree, I got a beef entree. It was shreded beef and mushrooms over bean noodles with tomatoes and potatoes and garlic. My biggest complaint is that the sauce was just very very thin - it was like an oily/watery tomato sauce. The very thin, small noodles got lost in the mix. I tried my boyfriend's chicken steamed dumplings, and these were alright, but they were very basic, and didn't go that well with the sauce they came with. \\n\\nSo yeah, that's nice that this restaurant is not too busy for walk-ins on 8:30 on a weekend night, but then again, I may not be going down this side street again except to pick up the latest best sellers.\\n\\nPS: The other couple I dined with got 2 cups of Poecha tea, the traditional butter tea of the region.

A couple of my friends have been here before and recommended it so being in the area my family decided to give this place a try. There's not a lot of ramen spots in the suburbs so I was very excited to eat at this restaurant.\\n\\nWe walked in and were seated immediately, which was good for a Saturday night around 6PM. Our server took our order and we started off with some gyoza. The gyoza was probably purchased inside Uwajimaya's frozen food aisle and was slightly cold and had not even a little crisp to it. It didn't bother me as much because I was there for the ramen. My mom ordered the killer spicy ramen with miso broth, my sister ordered the shoyu ramen, and I ordered the miso ramen. The wait for our ramen was ridiculous, around 30 minutes and the place wasn't even packed. I would've been less irritated if our waiter at least came by to check on us. 30 minutes passed and we finally got our ramen. \\n\\nLet me tell you this- as someone who is part Japanese and has been to Japan numerous times and have tried many versions of authentic Japanese ramen, this place is a joke. You can really taste the cheap price you pay for a bowl of their ramen. Noodles were good, you can tell it's freshly made but it's the broth that threw us off. My mom's \\"killer spicy\\" miso ramen was not even close to being spicy, my sisters shoyu ramen broth tasted weird, and both miso ramen me and my mom ordered DID NOT taste like miso. No miso flavor at all. I asked our waiter if he could give me some miso paste but I was turned away because he said \\"the miso paste is only for the broth.\\" Like yeah, I know, but your miso broth doesn't taste like miso. He didn't even go back to the kitchen and attempt to see if he could even get some. His other excuse was that \\"maybe the miso didn't oxidize into the soup yet.\\" Oh? When is it supposed to be oxidized? Didn't make any sense since miso should readily be dissolved into the broth. Just a bunch of excuses when he should've just got me some damn miso. We weren't impressed and won't be recommending this restaurant to anyone. I would have rather eaten Sapporo Ichiban noodles at home. If anything I expect more effort to be made by the waiter to try to satisfy us as first time customers. Luckily we tried this restaurant out before we brought my Japanese grandfather here. He would've laughed at how flavorless everything was followed by the excuses our waiter gave us. Such a joke. If there was an option for no stars I would've selected that option. If you haven't tried authentic ramen then I would see why some people gave this place more than one star. Lol! I'm honestly so surprised that this restaurant inside an authentic Japanese food market was not impressive at all.\\n\\nIf you want authentic Japanese ramen I suggest Kukai Izakaya. Hands down the best service and best ramen in the Portland/Beaverton area. You will not be disappointed and will keep coming back for more. Service is better and they also have more choices for appetizers and ramen combinations."},{"name":"The Local","address":"758 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite bars in ATL.

I am underage but I was not there to try and sneak an alcoholic beverage, I was merely there to meet my family for a quick meal. I was the first one there, and headed for the hostess stand, which was stationed well outside the perimeter of the restaurant. As I neared, I was approached by a man, who was already standing outside the establishment, but not close enough to draw a connection. He was quickly abrasive asking to see my ID, telling me I could not enter after 630 without a ID proving I was older then 21. This would have been all well and good, if it had not been that it was 620 (not a huge difference but still), and that my only intention was to speak to the hostess, once again, outside of the perimeter of the establishment. A little premature on the mans part. When I defended myself against him he told me I had an attitude. The hostess wouldn't take down my name or quote me a time until my entire party was present, and would not apologize for the security mans actions. When my party was finally whole, I approached the stand once more, where the manager now stood, because obviously I was a \\"situation.\\" I asked him to put us into the system and quote us a time. Although there were plenty of visible openings, and this restaurant does not take reservations, I was told that it would be a 45 minute wait, but that once again that i would not be allowed entrance without the company of a legal adult, even though I had pointed out my family to him, containing my father and step mother, who are both well over the drinking age, but he was skeptical of this, as me and my family do not share the same skin color. Once again he defended the doorman premature actions saying \\"Its the way we do things here.\\" If that is the way you would like to be treated, this is the perfect restaurant for you.

However for a business, 5 minutes can make or break a good customer experience.  I've been a repeat customer of Ikenohana for a few years and have always enjoyed the food despite the mediocre service.  I've brought my wife on many lunches and my family to many dinners and consider myself to be a \\"regular\\" customer.  A recent experience has made me reconsider my patronage to this small and somewhat quaint restaurant.  It was 11:25a and we arrived at the restaurant. As it was fall, it was cold and rainy - a typical day in the Pacific Northwest.  My wife proceeded to enter the restaurant to escape the cold and I quickly followed.  Upon entry, we observed the restaurant staff moving quickly around, in efforts to get their day and operating routine started. I began to sit on one of the benches on the waiting area when one of the employees told my wife to exit as the restaurant had not opened yet.  The restaurant opens at 11:30a and it was a little after 11:25a.  Mind you, it was cold and rainy outside.  We could have experienced a wonderful service experience if the employees made some effort to explain that the restaurant would be opening momentarily and if we wouldn't mind having a seat while they were undergoing the opening process. Furthering the customer experience, an offering of a beverage e.g. hot tea, would have made us feel very welcomed.  Instead we got, \\"We are not open yet, please go back outside.\\"  If the restaurant did not want any unintentional entry, why didn't they keep the front door locked???  At this point, my wife and I proceeded to exit back to the \\"cold and wet\\" exterior.  I was very disappointed in such an \\"unwelcoming\\" gesture.  I could understand if we were 20, 15, or even 10 minutes early, but asking us to return outside when the restaurant would be opened in a matter of a few minutes, was interpreted as we were not welcomed.  Folks lock the door, it's not a difficult concept.  Way to counter the Irasshaimase („ÅÑ„Çâ„Å£„Åó„ÇÉ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åõ) concept.

It must come from their Barcelona Tapas roots (same owners), but honestly the whole Bartaco experience would be significantly better if they just treated it like a normal restaurant. The issue is that everyone orders on the same card so they throw all the tacos that people order onto one big plate, and you have to go grab your own taco off the communal plate. They should have a card for each person, and bring all the things I ordered on one plate as to avoid confusion. They've messed up orders half of the time that I went so they're always comp-ing food, which is great for me, but not best for their business. That aside, I do like to eat there, and the servers always have a smile on their face and are very eager to serve you. They have a blue dragonfly card that you put into the stand to indicate to them that you need something, and they will quickly come to your service.\\n\\nOCCASION\\nIt seems like there is an inverse relationship between the quality of service and the number of people in your party. The best service I got when I went with one other person. It was decent with 5 people. And the worst with large groups of 12+. I'd recommend coming here for lunch or happy hour, but try to bring a smaller group if possible.\\n\\nPARKING\\nIs a nightmare. Thankfully now they have complimentary valet for both lunch and dinner. If you don't want to valet, you can park across the street at the 5 Season's parking lot since there's plenty of parking there. Or if you're lucky, there's a couple spaces that are usually free if you go on the street behind the restaurant, then walk up the staircase next to the bike shop. Either way, you NEED to carpool. Trust me, just do it. \\n\\nOverall, Bartaco is a great addition to the area, and has become our office's default lunch and happy hour location for the great atmosphere and food. But expect service to be a bit iffy especially with larger groups."},{"name":"Pho Van","address":"8557 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My family and I came here due to the large line at tatsuya. \\n\\nWe all got different pho.

Service was friendly and the food came out in less than 10 mins. I would've rated Gus's 5 stars.\\n\\nHOWEVER...our second experience was a polar opposite with so many problems.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I came in around 8:05pm. We grabbed a seat that was currently available near the server station in the front. A waiter came up to us and took our drink orders and since we were ready, we placed our order with him right away at 8:10. We ordered two '2 White Meat Plates' and that was that. 30 mins went by and we still hadn't received our food. Finally our waiter notices that something is wrong and asks us if we had not received our food yet. Our obvious answer, \\"No\\". The waiting ensued. A couple minutes later, the couple next to us had just left and their waiter had came by to clean up. Instead of actually wiping the table, he took the black bill/checkbook and used the long edge of it to dust off the crumbs. \\n\\nOur food finally came 40 mins after we had ordered. Our food was good as last time but our experience was ruined when a few minutes later, we saw our server get a rag, and wring it dry literally right next to me in a dirty water bucket that was between our table and the server station. The water splashed into my seat and the ground surrounding it... a completely unappetizing moment. A few questions arise about this moment. Why the heck is there is a bucket for dirty water next to customer seating? Isn't that what the kitchen/back-room is for? Secondly, why would you wring it right in vision of eating customers? I couldn't enjoy my food well after seeing dirty tablecloth water/juice splashing all over the place.\\n\\nI can understand food coming out late if they were busy, but they didn't seem too busy because there weren't people coming in at all and the cooks/chefs were seemingly hanging out and talking visibly near the counter/bar for a good few minutes. On top of that, a new couple that came in to sit next to us at maybe 8:35 received their food maybe 5-8 minutes after they ordered... so basically they came in 30 minutes after us and received their food at the same time. It's frustrating to see this unfold in person.\\n\\nI am a waitress so I understand how restaurants tend to work. However, the type of service that I received today is truly inexcusable. The chicken here is amazing and since I received a really good experience the first time, I'll give it 2 stars. But if this happened to be my first time dining, then this is easily a 1 star.\\n\\nIf you must eat at this joint here are a few tips.\\n- The chicken is really the only thing you should get. It's really good.\\n- The sides aren't very outstanding and are your typical sides that you would taste at any other restaurant. You could do without them.\\n- Be prepared for inconsistent wait times. \\n- If you don't want to risk getting bad service, then call it in to-go; you will get to enjoy your chicken without table juice."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Good excellent, timing in kitchen POOR!

We waited in line for 30 mins and drove to this place 40 mins from our home due to the rating on yelp.\\n\\nWe were a party of two and all other larger parties were allowed to sit except us coz apparently tables of 4/6 were opening up. There are no tables for two except the counters/ bars. When we mentioned this to the buzzers they said the \\" the owners\\" want to maximize profits and hence don't want to encourage parties of two except on the counters. Most stupid thing I have every heard. When we asked if we could talk to a manager , the manager didn't want to come by to talk and had an attitude and said \\" they could just wait or leave \\". Not only is the staff rude I personally don't think their food is that great that I would wanna stand arnd and be treated in an appropriate manner for eggs and pancakes. There are TONs of great options in Boston rather than this dingy unprofessional crappy dumpy place in the dumps of Allston.\\nI don't think ppl should have to deal with the frustration we faced this morning and I hope our reviews show up there.

It is a really cool space that is sort of the mix between a Krystal and an upscale restaurant. We ordered cocktails -- a Peach Sweet Tea with Firefly Sweet Tea Vodka and Peach Schnapps-- and one of their special nitrogen martinis--a Root Beer Float Martini-- and these were not only fun and creative, but yummy to boot. The nitrogen martini came with the disclaimer, \\"Please don't drink it until it stops smoking.\\" You've got to love that. \\n\\nAfter perusing the menu of creative little 5.5 ounce burgers, we ordered 3. One hanger steak, brisket, & short rib-based beef burger called the butcher's cut with caramelized onion, blue cheese, red wine jam; a chorizo burger featuring the spicy pork sausage, romesco ketchup, hash browns, fried egg, manchego cheese, and smoked mayo; and one meatless mushroom & swiss, which was a \\"wild mushroom patty, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, red wine ketchup.\\" We rounded out the meal with an order of vodka-battered onion rings.\\nThe beef burger was tasty due to its toppings, but the beef, although properly cooked to a nice pink medium and not dry, was a bit on the bland side.  The mushroom burger was delicious and well seasoned, the mushroom flavor not overwhelmed by the condiments. But OMG, the bite I had of the chorizo burger was a flavor bomb. Mildly spicy, eggy, cheesy, potato-y goodness. Like breakfast on a bun, but better. The onion rings were hot and crisp on the outside and the onion was soft an buttery on the inside with just the right amount of greasy. And don't tell me onion rings shouldn't be greasy. \\n\\nWe topped off the meal by splitting a burnt marshmallow and nutella shake, which they kindly distributed into two little glasses for us so each of us could have their share of charred little mini marshmallows. My hubby doesn't even like nutella and he enjoyed all of his. And as for me, mmmmm. Though they could have even let the marshmallows char a wee bit more to get good and gooey.\\n\\nWe sat at the far back corner booth near the front door and had a bit of an incident with someone coming in to ask for money, but we didn't let it bother us and the hostess, who had been seating someone when he came in, promptly asked the guy to leave. Our waitress and the manager came right over to apologize, which really wasn't necessary, and were really nice. The manager and I chatted about Top Chef, as I shamelessly asked to meet Richard, but alas he was not there. He promised me a signed publicity shot, tho! :D\\n\\nAll in all a fun place to try some really creative food and drinks."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Read a lot of reviews on the Disney bulletin boards where people raved about Yak & Yeti so when we planned our day at the Animal Kingdom Park, we knew we were going to make an attempt to have lunch there as long as the wait time wasn't ridiculous.

I had heard it was very divey, and the reviews on Yelp suggested that the crowd wasn't very cool. Thankfully, I was very pleasantly surprised. Whereas most bars my friend and I walked by were either dead or had an awful Sublime cover band playing, the Model was decently attended for a Wednesday night. And the music?! 60s Soul & underground Rock & Roll? Doesn't get better than that. If they keep having DJ nights like this, the Model might be my new favorite place to get a drink and dance.\\n\\nThe setup isn't too bad. The \\"cafe\\" is separated in half, into two rooms, with the bar in the first half right when you walk in and the dance floor portion in the other. It wasn't a problem getting a beer given the night, but having the bar so close to the entrance could be either a help or a hindrance on other nights. On the one hand, you don't have to walk through a big crowd to get to the bar when you come in. On the other hand you might have a tough time if everyone's crowding the bar. It wasn't a problem last night, but something to consider.\\n\\nBeer was decently cheap (2.50 for a PBR draft) and the bartenders were cool (Dave the bartender was just as enthusiastic about the music as I was, which is very cool to see. He DJs a soul/funk night there next Thursday as well). The scene was probably not a typical one given the music, but either way it was very welcoming. It's always nice to see a mishmash of different people and have the yeah-bros and their tarts left out of the equation."},{"name":"Model Caf√©","address":"7 N Beacon St","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm gonna go ahead and admit that I was well into my cups when I stumbled into The Model, so this review is much more about hazy impressions than actual experiences.

That said, I didn't feel that condescending \\"you-don't-belong-in-my-bar\\" glare that usually radiates towards me in such places. That's good. The PBR is PBR (read: gross), and the bartenders seemed pretty cool. We only stayed long enough to split the aforementioned PBR, then deciding we were drunk enough, stumbled back out into Sunday night.\\n\\nOne of my first impressions was that my Colorado BFF will LOVE the Model (or Moe-del as we ended up calling it).

The flavor was spot on, though I felt like bun to filling ration was off, as there was too much bun. The mussels came next and were absolutely to die for. Hands down, the best food I've eaten in a while. The broth was so good that we asked for extra garlic bread to sop it up, which our waitress happily obliged (complimentary). Last came the surf + turf black pepper shanghai noodles, which was my husband's favorite dish.

It's hand-ground Angus beef. I once owned 200 head of Angus beef, so I know a little something about that. And I am keenly aware that when you want a ribeye, prime is better than choice, but when it comes to burgers and cheesesteaks, it is sometimes counterproductive to waste good beef. Sometimes the choice beef provides better results. Dan's and Fran's have learned this lesson - a little bird told me they both opt for the 73% stuff and not the super-lean stuff. Hopdoddy's is serving the super-lean stuff, and frankly a little more grease would do a body good.\\n\\nI ordered mine not just rare but super-rare, and it wasn't, I'd say it was more like medium.  Meh.\\n\\nNow the fries. Very unimpressive. They were mostly stubby and a little mushy, not al dente.

Also, when I was asked if I wanted moist of lean brisket, I could not tell the difference, both had a big cap of fat on top of the meat. I asked for lean and yet half the weight was fat, if I want lean I expect lean meat not a cap of fat I have to remove.

Plus, cards are accepted too - Voodoo you taking notes?  Seating is average but it definitely gets the job done.  After my name was called, my donut and coffee were ready to be served.  The texture of the raised donut is firm but not dry.  It's chewy, but not tough.  It has the right amount of sweetness to avoid the usual sugar coma.  The sugar toasted crust had a similar taste to the creme brulee dessert.  The cream filling inside is just enough that it doesn't goop all over the place with each bite.  After my friends saw the picture I took of the donut, a couple of them went shortly after I did to get their fair share.\\n\\nA few days ago, I went back again to indulge in the blueberry basil bourbon aka BBB delight.  The donut is certainly huge and could be shared if warranted.  Again the donut has the right amount of sweetness and texture.

I would describe it like this - like espresso is to coffee The COOP bread pudding is to cinnamon buns.  It was really flavorful and a great way to end the meal.\\n\\nThe COOP's food is excellent.  I will definitely be returning there often.  I did not mind the line as it is worth the wait. The location is great - you can easily walk there from Park Avenue (5 min.) or find parking nearby.  The staff is very professional and they make you feel like your needs are the most important ones.  It is hard to find that in any restaurant.  While the kitchen was very busy and there were a lot of customers the atmosphere overall was very relaxing and you it felt like you belonged there.  I also was impressed that the managers were not in the back but meeting with customers requesting feedback on ways to make the restaurant best it can be.  Having such a great attitude I am certain that John Rivers and his team will only make this Gem of a restaurant a favorite for many years to come.\\n\\nI can't wait to return and while I know two great meals I will order again I will also try and branch out to order some of the other items on the menu."},{"name":"Shan-A-Punjab","address":"500 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"This is an Indian place that isn't afraid to make it spicy for the non-Desi.

Sadly, none of them really jumped at me. I even overheard talking about his favorite- the project- and it was okay but nothing to write home about. Perhaps the IPA just wasn't hoppy enough.

The concept behind their sandwiches is very interesting, they have a chef from all of the great restaurants in the Boston area create a signature sandwich...which gives you endless opportunities to try something new and delicious. My favorite sandwich is the Elephant Walk sandwich, which is basically an omelette with goat cheese and veggies with a side salad. However, I hear that all of the sandwiches that my friends have tried (such as the Zuni roll and the eggplant one) are just as amazing. Their sangria is great, and I recently tried their peach whiskey smash, which is to die for.\\n\\nThey also have a great outside patio area, but the wait is typically very long because it's on a first come first serve basis.

I didn't want to be disappointed because I love Rudy's corn so much. But I'm glad I tried it because it was actually almost as good as Rudy's! I enjoyed their green beans because that's not usually a BBQ side one sees. Their potato salad was creamy and dilly. I'm a fan of dill, so that was a bonus. Nothing notable about their Mac and cheese. However, their sauces were exceptional. I especially liked their sweet BBQ sauce. You should try that.

I would recommend it to anyone visiting. \\n\\n Cocktail: My idea of \\"a little spicy\\" scares some people, but if you are eating at an Indian restaurant hopefully you aren't afraid of a little heat. Or a lot of heat. I had their infused vodka martini that was perfect level of spice and taste. Exactly what I expected and hoped for when dining in a Pacific-cuisine restaurant. \\n\\nWine: Joe had a glass of Brancott pinot noir, and since it was a Monday night we got our bottle at dinner (Benton Lane Pinot Noir) for half price! They were already speaking our language. Their wine list is average sized but shows a lot of diversity. The man who appeared to be the head bartender was obviously knowledgable and had a lot of experience under his belt. I'm not saying novice bartenders are bad--everyone has to start somewhere. But no one will contest that a tried and true bartender wo can suggest the perfect wine or cocktail  levels up the experience. It's like moving from basic cable to DirectTV. (Or Dish, depending on your channel preferences.)\\n\\nService: Before I touch on dinner I want to rave about our server, Jacob. He welcomed having a table as talkative as Joe and myself, and since Joe works in fine dining he routinely grills servers. For the record, Jacob did excellent. He explained all the food in detail so we could make good decisions based on tastes and quantity. Not only that, but he was fun to talk to; Joe and I could have stayed there all night. If Joe and I lived in Austin, we would have enlisted this guy as our friend, or maybe adopted him. Ya know. Whichever. \\n\\n\\nFood: Right out the gate Joe and I jumped on their curried muscles with a side of steamed jasmine rice. Ace right away. I used the curry sauce on most of my dishes that night, and I was tempted to take it home. I found the muligitawny not so much to my taste, but never the less it was a good representation. I thought it typically had a more pronounced lemon flavor, but it takes all kinds. Finally, we landed on the Goan Yellow Curry Shrimp: excellent, excellent. Yellow curry isn't my favorite, but this dish  was right at home on my palate. Jacob also let us sample their Raita, which was delicious. All manners went out the door-- i licked that bowl clean. Raita is a side of yogurt whipped with carrots, cucumber, and seasoning. Perfect for cooling off after a mouthful of Indian spice (which of course, I never have a problem with). \\n\\nDesert: Unfortunately I cannot remember specifcally which deserts we had: it was a scoop of two different kinds of ice cream (both amazing) and a chocolate mousse cake with a raspberry sauce. The cake and sauce paired so well with our wine I thought I was going to fall out of my chair. I can't attempt to go into more about it without getting emotional.

They also have a full bar with beer, wine, and mixed drink options that will please most reasonable diners' palates. During my visit this past weekend, I opted for dessert and a glass of wine, while my partner opted for coffee and dessert. After careful review of the dessert case, we ended up with the carrot cake and a chocolate cake. Unfortunately, both were stale, flavorless, and poorly presented.\\n\\nService: Service was quick and friendly, but we only ordered drinks and dessert, so I imagine the situation likely would have been different had prepared food been involved.\\n\\nAtmosphere: After walking by this place on multiple occasions, I always assumed from the exterior that it was so form of upscale cafe; however, after actually entering, I felt like the victim of a bait and switch scheme. The interior is incredibly cramped, disorganized, and seemingly run down. It's also dark as a cave and the music is so loud that it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation.\\n\\nPrice: Overpriced for the quality of the food. Two desserts, a coffee, and a glass of wine cost $30.

One thing that's awesome about this place is that at least once a month they have coupons, such as BOGO Free Sunday Breakfast or $10 dinner buffet. If there's something huge going on, like a holiday or something, expect there to be more coupons. Now to the actual prices of the meals. I'm actually not 100% positive on how they are without coupons since whenever I go there I use them, but last I went (which was on March 14th for dinner), we used a 20% off coupon and each meal came up to a little over $10. I remember years ago they used to be $10 WITHOUT the aid of coupons.\\n\\nAnd the reason why I'm making such a big deal about the price is because at the end of the day the quality of the food is basic and bland. Yes it's a buffet and yes buffets usually value quantity over quality, but most of their items are terribly bland. One time, for a limited time only, they had this lemon theme going on where the 2-4 new dishes had lemon in it. I like lemon-y food, so I tried them all, and...No. No thank you. The pasta was basically hot lemon juice with some pasta thrown in there. The only thing I liked from the last visit was this cookie bar desert they have. I don't know if that's limited too, but I hope not.\\n\\nNow the main reasom why I'm giving this location a 1-star (instead of a 2) is because the when I went last week they had so many dishes that were dirty.

Asking what toast they had seemed to be a burden as if I should just know what toast they offer. I also asked if they had decaf coffee to which one of the women replied \\"I'll get you whatever we have left\\" so I thought to myself, \\"well okay, I'll take whatever's left\\" even though it was a rude way to reply. I got my bacon & toast, decaf coffee and started eating. Moments later another woman slammed a whole pot of coffee on the table and said, \\"this is for you since you drink decaf\\" -- I didn't need a whole pot of coffee to myself nor did I ask for one. It was extremely rude. My \\"surprised look\\" seemed to offend the woman who made it for me and and so she continued to shout reasons as to why she made it for me 'across' the cafe. What a WEIRD experience. Don't just assume people want a whole pot of coffee because they drink decaf and don't be so rude to customers who intend to come in and PAY you for for a meal and a good time.

It was chaos.\\n\\nWe had to order our drinks 4 times because the bartender forgot about us.

I have never sat out on the patio.\\nNow, if you are looking for an authentic Ethiopian experience, this probably isn't for you, but there are plenty of other places in Atlanta to get that experience.

Still thinking they were open til 3, we said we didn't mind waiting. A few minutes later, the manager came back to say it was going to take too long and they wouldn't actually be able to do the burger. Of course, it's not uncommon for the kitchen to close earlier than the bar in places open so late on the weekends, so we said that was fine, but it would have been nice if we'd been told the kitchen was closing.

It wasn't until the lights came up and chairs started going on tables that we realized they were closing. \\n\\nThe manager could have explained at any time that they were about to close and not offered us anything, but instead was very apologetic and made sure we'd be back despite the inconvenience.

It as a relatively small portion at lunch, and the price was higher than it is at other Japanese restaurants I've been to in the Boulder/Denver area.  The green tea was excellent and I liked the teapot and teacup.  The service was friendly and efficient.  Tempura is something else I enjoy...and I tried it the second time I dined here at Akiyama.  Though it was ok, the portion was relatively small, and the price somewhat higher than at other comparable restaurants.\\n\\nA combination (think Bento) that would have cost me ~$10 at Japango cost $18.50 here, for the exact same ingredients, only measurably smaller portions.  The quality of the food is fine here--my main issue is with the portion sizes and overall cost.\\n\\nI did eat here a third time, too, in March, and not much had changed.
