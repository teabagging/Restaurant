On my frequent east side bike strolls I ponder why operations such as this have yet to pop up. This area of the east side area is a gem that has truly yet to hit its full potential.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is simple in its design. Simply clean, modern, and hip in the aesthetics. Nothing complex, but absolutely pleasant none the less. As for the menu it's also simple in its structure.\\n\\nBut the food tells another story.\\n\\nComplexity is infused in every dish. Each serving you order will leave you saying \\"yes\\". Never was there one instance were we came across a dish that didn't strike our fancy. We started off with the vegetable part of the menu by selecting the sticky Brussel Sprouts, Zucchini, Frites, and Romaine Hearts. I highy recomend the zucchini dish to anyone. The use of carrot dressing, pine nuts, and feta with a sweet tone really left us impressed. The frites were cooked to perfection. The manzano dipping sauce surely was a nice complement.\\n\\nFrom the Wood Grill we ordered the charred octopus, chicken thighs, and Aleppo Praws. Now I have never enjoyed Octopus. Something about the texture throws me off, but for some reason that night I happily ate half of the serving! The use of a garlic aioli tamed the usual taste that octopus has. If there was one plate that didn't hit a particular high note it happened to be the chicken thighs. Though delicious, the chicken came out to charred and overcooked. The use of cassiatore and onion aioli layered under the chicken brought this dish up to being par. A spicy hint is added to the cassiatore that brings it up a notch.\\n\\nFinally, we came to desert. And indeed it was a treat! We ordered the sticky toffee pudding, hazzelnut layer Cake, and apple pie. If you were to meet me you'd get the idea that I am bit of a health nut. But if I was offered Launderette's desserts everyday I would be quite the fatty in no time! The sticky toffee pudding hit every note of excellence. The array of flavors is overwhelming, but in a great way. I have yet to enjoy a desert in quite sometime with little regret.\\n\\nAs for the drinks they are easily some of the best in town. We started off dinner with the Breakfest of Champions and Tea Time Mule. Its important to note that any drink with mezcal automatically strikes my attention. The use of Mezcal in the Breakfest of Champions surly didn't disappoint. With the use of a Champagne saucer the mixture contained mescal, lime, orange flower water, and egg white. Pure bliss ticked up after each and every sip of this splendid concoction. The Tea Time Mule was noteworthy, but a bit to sweet for my liking.\\n\\nMid dinner I caught a glimpse of a drink served at the bar that wasn't on the menu. Make sure to order this one: the House Margarita. What I truly loved about La Condessa is that they offed the most refreshing margarita in town. Absolutely the best in my books. And here, now at Launderette, I am pleased to say that they now have the best margarita in town!\\n\\nIn addition to the restaurant, Launderette is soon to expand next door. At the moment it is a small grocery mart. Once the tenant lease is up they will start conversion of the place into a upscale neighborhood grocery store. In back of the grocery store shall be a Szechuan restaurant.

Such deliberation was happening in my brain last night, the other contenders being Yeah Burger, Atkins Park and Highland Tap. The also-rans were in the mix mostly for convenience, and they each have a lot of other factors in their favor. But the burger was the thing. \\n\\nFor this review, I really should have brushed up on my beef-descriptors because that's what their burgers deserve. But for those of us lacking a cattleman's vocabulary, I suppose it suffices to say that the burger flavor is assertive enough but also complementary and in balance with the bun, cheese and bacon (which by itself would be a top-notch snack). I would guess that this is very fresh meat and a blend of fats and cuts that they picked themselves, because this simply tastes more burgery and fresh than at other places _ even those that specialize in hamburgers. I avoided their pre-selected condiment combinations in favor of my own concoction because frankly salsa is a crappy burger topping. Sorry, it just is. Also not a fan of pimento cheese or BBQ sauce or special house sauces on burgers, but I digress. (And, yes, I grew up in the South.) \\n\\nGiven those preferences, you can see how I ruled out the house burger, gringo burger or cowboy burger. I just did cheddar, bacon, mayo along with lettuce, tomato, pickle and onion. To give a sense of how good my first one was, i chose to skip an appetizer or side and order a second burger to round out my meal. This time I did double patties, which may be the way to go. You up the beefy quality, but it's still not overpowering.\\n\\nSo overall, I hope I've achieved my goal of helping folks rule out other destinations when they are focused on getting a good burger.

I love bacon, but I'm also trying to stay good on the losing weight thing so I don't plan to get the decadent bacon wrapped concoctions available.\\n\\nI also believe that if I place can't do the basics well, I won't return for the more complex options.  So, what did I get?  I got a Chicago dog, waffle fries and the broccoli salad.  The husband got a dog with carmelized onions with baked beans.\\n\\nThe good: The beans (according to the husband) were very tasty.  The waffle fries were crispy, seasoned well, and quite nice.  Many places don't make a decent waffle fry, and these were done well.\\n\\nThe okay: His dog was okay.  He didn't think it was worth writing home about, but it was decent.\\n\\nThe not so great: My Chicago dog.  I love Chicago dogs.  I've had alot of them during my lifetime.  The dog I ate was not a Chicago dog.  It superficially looked similar, but its was akin to getting a generic Barbie in the Christmas stocking with your mother saying 'its close enough, right?' (uh, no)\\nWhat was wrong about the Chicago dog?  First, Chicago dogs should come on poppyseed buns.  Their menu says they do.  This doggie showed up on a regular plain bun.  Why is this a problem?  Am I so picky that I have to have my poppy seed fix on my dog?  Nah... that's not it actually.  If you haven't had a Chicago dog before, it shows up with alot of stuff on it... tomatoes, mustard, onions, relish, peppers, etc.  The poppy seed bun is a slightly enlarged bun so when you grab Mr. Doggie in your paws the toppings stay in place allowing you to eat it as Chicago intended.  You get the dog on the bottom and the slightly sour, slightly sweet toppings blending into culinary tastiness in your mouth.\\n\\nHere's what happens at Franks with the regular bun they serve... you grab the dog, take a bite and splat! all the toppings start oozing off onto your plate (or red plastic serving dish).  Because the bun is too small for the iconic Chicago dog, the toppings cannot be held on the dog properly.\\n\\nNow, if you are a Chicago dog person, you are probably mentally complaining saying \\"well, she didn't mention the celery salt that belongs on the dog\\"... I know, I know... I'm getting to it... or the lack of it.  That's also why this was not a Chicago dog... it didn't have any on it.  So, ultimately, it was a dressed up dog that looked like a Chicago dog, but it was mostly just an impersonation that disappointed more than pleased. bummer.\\n\\nThe last thing I got was vile... broccoli salad.  I LOVE this stuff.  Furr's has a big place in my heart for this salad.  They make a version that rocks.  Whole Foods even makes a decent version.  Franks is serving something that may go by the name broccoli salad, but it tastes like the stuff your crazy aunt throws together and misses half the ingredients.  Broccoli salad should be a delicious ambrosia of salty (bacon), pungent (red onion), sweet (raisins), creamy (mayo), tart (vinegar), nutty (well, nuts) and slightly sour (raw broccoli).\\nWhat does Frank serve?  They serve Broccoli and mayo.  The onions and bacon had absolutely NO flavor.  They might have just as easily mixed stryofoam in there for all the flavor the onions and bacons brought to the table.  This is a shame because Franks touts their love of the bacon.  There was zippo bacon flavor in the salad.  The almonds were probably not toasted and had this limp, tasteless flavor in the salad.  Worse, there was no tart or sweet in the salad whatsoever.  It lacked any vinegar or sugar (which is often from the raisins) for balance.  The salad that was served to me tasted exactly like raw broccoli and mayo mixed together and served.\\nblech.\\n\\nSo, if I had issues with the meal, why 3 stars?  Well ,as they were clearing our table, I think a manager came over and asked if everything was okay (in part I think because the broccoli salad was almost completely full).  I said that it was an unbalanced salad without any tartness to it.  She immediately apologized and it was pulled off our bill without us even asking about it.  I really appreciated that.  Gold star for great service.\\n\\nHowever, in retrospect, I can see it one of 2 ways... either they have the most awesome customer service ever, or they know they have an issue with the salad because of previous complaints... it could go either way.\\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere at Franks was fun.  I enjoyed that, though I didn't feel quite hip enough.  I'm not rushing back, but I may wander by for one of their deep fried bacon dogs after I lose another 35 pounds (which is the current number I'm down)."},{"name":"Original Joe's Restaurant & Bar","address":"11080 No. 5 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"I been there many times to see if they would improve and I have constant issues with unsanitary conditions.

I got a large scoop of pate with apple slices, cornichons and bread ( I ended up taking quite a bit of it home with me) My friend had the porccini ravioli - and raved about them.  My friend had the bread pudding - amazing! it wasn't mushy like most places I've had it, and was served hot - also a rareity.  I had the apple tort - Oh my god! to die for! way to small a slice though - could give a bit more guys, especially for the price. \\n\\nUnfortunately there were a few issues - while we had a great waiter, there were times we had to wait quite a bit. I ran out of bread for my pate and by the time we got more - I was ready to move on to dessert. We had to flag him down several times to order, or just get water refills. It looked like they only had 2 waiters , so I am hoping it was just a case of being understaffed. The outside tables are a bit small, and we had issues with water from spray dripping on us. It also appeared that there was little to no a/c inside.  Parking is also an issue - street parking only - I thought it said lot parking on the website but I didn't see a lot anywhere.\\n\\nAside from these issues, I cannot wait to go back. They serve breakfast all day, and I hear a belgian waffle calling my name."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Delicious!

Then our original snarky waiter came back without apology or concern for my dad (who is by the way a doctor and well aware of the hazards of choking on a rubber band). He suggested that he bring a new dish, which my dad refused and then a dessert, which my dad also refused because we had already ordered desert.  He then brought it out anyways, once again showing disregard for what we actually wanted. \\n\\nTo top it all off we spoke to two managers on the floor.

The St. E's pizza is phenomenal - the crust is fresh and chewy, the greens are crisp, and the subtle blend of fresh veggies and cheese is truthfully fantastic.  I'm not a light eater, and after two slices of this, I tapped out. Think New York style slices and you've got the idea here. If you order a specialty pizza (meaning anything other than single topping), you get a free order of Mozzarella sticks with your delivery - and they're pretty tasty mozzerella sticks, not breaded but seemingly battered.\\n\\nTheir subs are pretty decent also. I've had the Stockyard sub on one occasion, and it was tasty enough to blind em from the fact that I was likely going to gain 15 pounds from it. Tons of roast beef and about half a pound of potato salad slapped in a roll. Good to go.\\n\\nThe ONLY complaint I really have is the fact that the staff sometimes looks and acts like someone took a dump in their morning cereal.

The last steakhouse I visited was Saltgrass in Dallas, and I wasn't really impressed. But my Dad is a steakhouse fan so I figured why not bring him to Longhorn, as it's a place no one in my family has been to. We stopped in last night for an Early Early Father's Day dinner, and I've got to say, I thought we were in a Texas Land & Cattle. Then again, it may just be normal steakhouse decor. Oh well.\\n\\nFor a Wednesday night, the place was not at all busy, yet we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. We were confused because there were six, SIX open tables. Having been a waitress before, I kind of took it as them being understaffed. Fortunately, we were seated in 15 minutes. YAY! But boy, did it take forever to get our drink order. I mean, it was a good 15 minute wait. I was ready to leave, but our waitress finally made her appearance. Lucky for her, she was very nice.\\n\\nI'm sad to report that our food took about an hour to come out. While we waited and waited, we were served incredibly delicious bread. We actually got about 3 servings of it, as the manager had no problem making sure we had a steady supply of it. Thumbs up for that!\\n\\nOur food finally arrived and I've got to admit... you can taste the freshness in their food. If the food is going to be THAT fresh, it is well worth the wait. My Dad ordered the chicken fried steak, and WOW! They certainly do not skimp on the portions. My Mom's grilled salmon salad also came with a heaping portion of salmon! My brother's chicken tenders was the only mediocre dish on our table (it would've looked prettier had he ordered a side besides salad). As for my grilled chicken strawberry salad (I shared with my husband, and it was enough to feed us both!), I've got to admit... it was AMAZEBALLS. The freshness and tenderness of the chicken was mouth-watering. The strawberries, tangerines and grapes were just the right amount of sweet. Topped off with walnuts and feta... I found my new favorite restaurant salad! As a Mom, I was very very pleased to find out that they offered a grilled chicken salad for kids. My son isn't much of a meat-eater, so he was happy to have had salad sized just for him. Good job, Longhorn!\\n\\nI wish I could give Longhorn the 5 stars. If I based this review on the food alone, I most certainly would give them that. But the whole having to wait 20 minutes for a table when we were not only the only ones waiting and seeing six open tables was a bit off-putting.

The parking there is non-metered, two-hour parking, is generally empty, and you don't have to cruise the surrounding blocks looking for permit parking for which you don't have a permit. (If you get to the 7-11, you've gone too far, it's literally just on Broadway as soon as you pass the Pescatore cross street.)\\n\\nEven better stuff: the desserts here are super-amazing, and huge. I'm generally not a fan of in-restaurant desserts as you can always just head down to JP Licks or something, but this place could very well be the exception.

There was no refill of iced tea, when I was able to get the servers attention and asked, I was told there were out of iced tea (no reason given why they didn't want to make more).

To make an extremely long review somehow shorter, let me give you the run down on why they only get 2 stars. \\n\\nThe restaurant is cute and cozy in the inside. Small but decorated with an eclectic chic vibe. When we entered the hostess asked if we had a reservation and I told her no. ( we are in town for vacation) she assured us that this was ok but informed us that in the future she suggested that we make a reservation. I lightened up the annoyed mood I was in by telling her that we came to visit from Houston because we heard this place had great reviews. She sat us at a small table in the very back of the restaurant. Our waitress was nice and informative. The calamari appetizer that we ordered that had fried calamari, fried capers, and fried gerkins was delicious. The wasabi aioli really made the dish pop. The batter for the calamari was crunchy yet light. Now on to my dislikes. \\n\\n\\n. The menu states that you are NOT allowed to send an order back because you don't like it, this includes cocktails and food. You can only send food back if there is an error in preparation. This bothered me because you Amy prepare something correctly and it still taste bad, so am I not supposed to ask for it to be replaced? \\n\\n. I ordered the fried chicken and lobster Mac and my date ordered the shrimp pad Thai. My food comes and I am severely underwhelmed. The pasta ( cavatappi with bits of farfalle mixed in) is over cooked almost mooshy and is tepid to put it lightly. The greens on my plate were like warm as well. I began to cut into the chicken which was a thigh, leg, and breast fastened combo and it is pink! I tell the waitress that I would please like another plate. She informs me that she cannot take a plate off the table at all and has to go get the manager. The manager comes and literally bends over into my plate and takes my knife and fork to open up the chicken and inform me that it is cooked and the blood I am seeing Is from the chicken bone  he then takes my plate away and says he will replace it so I can be sure that it is \\"cooked\\" 10 minutes later they bring me another plate. No hotter than the one I previously received. The chicken was still pink and gooey in the breast and thigh area and was over seasoned and burned. I could smell the old grease scent when they sat the plate on the table. The Pad Thai was a different story. The noodles used were not traditional to Pas Thai. They were so over cooked they were literally in clumps and needed to be cut to be edible. The \\"shrimp\\" that came in the dish was really 4 shrimp total! 4 shrimp for a dish that is advertised as Shrimp Pad Thai?! The taste lacked depth. Just sweetness. No sour no spice no salt. Basically the complete opposite of umami \\n\\n\\n. Then to make matter worse the manager is bickering with the waitresses about 10 feet from us and actually used expletives when talking to them. I had high hopes for this place because of the reviews but I will NEVER step foot in here again. There are plenty of places in Atlanta to eat.

The wait at our first restaurant of choice (toro bravo) was too long, so we wandered in here. \\n\\nwe went to Afrique Bistro for drinks at first. This began with my friend ordered a whiskey and ginger and was told by our waitress (who was the only person in the place, working the bar, the tables, and the door) that she was out of bitters and could not even make \\"fake\\" gingerale (coke, sprite, bitters), so she got a beer. Then they were out of cocktail napkins. then the strange jamaican house...techno... weird pop dance music began blaring and giving us all headaches. then another friend went to the restroom, only to come back and report that there was no toilet paper. \\nthey were also out of rolling rock (the cheap beer they offered)\\n\\nthen we ordered appetizers and meals and they were out of one of their sauces. Some of us ordered meals, some ordered appetizers. Eventually our meals started coming out, though for a group of 6 people, every single one of us ate alone.... not two dishes came out at the same time.\\n\\nnot only did our meals come out one by one over the course of about an hour. wrong sauces multiple times, wrong side dishes (white rice vs. couscous) , I ordered some sort of shrimp and veggie dish with couscous and instead I got a tiny 6 shrimp skewer (called jumbo prawns) and let them know that I had ordered the meal, not the skewer, only for our waitress to bring back the SAME 6 shrimp skewer 30 minutes later with a side of rice. I know this sounds unbelievable, it happened, except this time the shrimp were cold. \\n\\nAlso, the men's urinal overflowed. \\n\\nOh, and my friend's face almost got burned off in the first 2 seconds of being seated by a woman with a burning skillet frying coffee beans... for ambiance?? It was a bit careless, thats all. That was shortly followed by the owner approaching us to say \\"happy birthday, who's birthday is it? I have a birthday party coming\\". Only for us to explain awkwardly that it was not us.... then he just slowly walked away.\\n\\nJust for comedy's sake somewhere in the middle of this experience, because no one was working the door and it was left propped open, a homeless gentlemen decided to run in, chat with a table near the door, give us a \\"jazz hands\\" inspired dance and leave. \\n\\nYou can't make this stuff up. To our waitresses credit though, she was new, this was her 2nd saturday working there and she had the entire place to run by her self. She did her best to be accommodating for our obviously absurd experience. She was a sweetheart and we have no hard feelings toward her, she was thrown into a service industry nightmare and I hope, for her sake, that she's found a better gig. \\n\\n\\n\\nyep."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great veggie food, especially the \\"ren\\" tofu tacos!

Been open for a little while now, crowds look large.\\n\\nService was fine, if a bit harried. Seemed like too many tables per server, and intervals between table visits were inappropriately long: seated, wait, water, wait, menus, wait, drink orders, wait, wait, wait, drinks arrive, appies/dinner orders, WAIT, WAIT.\\n\\nBut that's the good news.\\n\\nHere's the grub:\\n\\n2 cocktails + burger with fries + lobster mac + seared salmon + french onion soup + steak frites.\\n\\nCocktails looked nice, on the expensive side for this part of town, but most interestingly, seemed to contain very little booze. Yep, I know, that's what they all say. Except this time, it's all true. Really a poor value, recommend against the cocktails, if you don't watch them being prepared. Sorry, true fact. And so sad, because the bar looks like a fantastic place to chill after the office.\\n\\nBurger OK, cooked to temperature but nothing stellar (especially given how incredibly easy it is to get a great burger in 2016, fantastic ones in multiple kitchens in town nowadays), fries in a cute basket but dead cold, bad sign. Seemed the meal had been sitting for quite some time before delivery to table.\\n\\nLobster mac, standard recipe but again nothing special, room temperature (barely warmish) with the beginning of a skin across the top, pretty clearly been held in the kitchen with it's cousin the burger for quite awhile before table arrival. Shoot and bummer!\\n\\nSeared salmon, recommended by server (and agreed to by customer) to be medium rare, but...FULLY well done (might have done better eating from the can), very dry, accompanying greens cold, grains congealed, obviously sitting under warmer for an eon before delivery. Gross.\\n\\nFrench onion soup. Disclaimer: I LOVE salty food, salt bagels, capers, pickles, cured olives. This soup was nearly inedible. Sodium explosion. Weird. Is this really happening with at least two of the owners on site, wandering through or sitting at a table. Is this really possible?\\n\\nFinally, and regrettably, the steak frites. Nice New York cut (the best part of the t-bone), had agreed to medium because it was for an 8 year old. First bite from the edge, obviously medium rare (not medium), but tasty, and kid actually loved it. But as we sliced into the interior, it became clear that most of the meat was actually blood rare, like a perfect ahi, but no sign of anything actually cooked beyond the slimmest outside sear, a minute at most on each side, ICE COLD in the interior. \\n\\nWTH? The dining room was not all that busy for most of the time we were there, but it's pretty clear that something odd is going on in the kitchen. Workflow? Space issues? Chef AWOL? Hard to say.\\n\\nGunbarrel will be a gold mine for anyone doing it well. Plenty of long-suffering northeast Boulder folks sitting on loads of cash without a lot of close-by, decent dining options, and clearly the Element investors have put a great deal of money and energy into this thing. Shame (and bewildering) that could lead to an entire table of drinks and food this mediocre (or worse).\\n\\nTerrific upside but, for now, not recommended.\\n\\n**Update: On reflection, this was one of the worst dining experiences our family has experienced in many years in Boulder. Embarrassing, actually. It's unfathomable how poorly the Element performed, all at a semi-premium cost. All dishes were mediocre or much worse. Burger King, across the road, would have immediately replaced the burger and fries served by the Element, and possibly fired the chef. It was HORRIBLE. \\n\\nMoreover, I don't see any public responses from Eric, Tiffinie, or Patrick explaining, apologizing, or promising better things to come. Is this arrogance, or rationalizing \\"growing pains\\"? Doesn't matter. The back channel info I've heard in the neighborhood, i.e., equivalent or worse experiences from several diners who do not wish to waste their time publishing comments in this forum, but rather will explicitly share with their crowd advice to avoid this business, may spell the eventual doom for what seemed to hold such promise."},{"name":"Sugar Addict Bakery","address":"2308 Hancock Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the best trailers in town, and THE best place to get an authentic beignet this side of New Orleans. \\nIf you go, DO NOT stop with the sugary treats.

I think the ricotta is a bit too heavy for the other ingredients but still pretty good although I like the olive topping much better.\\n3) Arrancini good as usual\\n4) Antica salad was very lemon-y. \\n5) Funghi pizza was burnt on a lot of the edges. I was sitting at the bar and I'd say most of the pizzas were coming out burnt in a lot of areas. Also no plates were given with the pizza so I ate off my napkin.

We have been to Pannullo's numerous times, but this was a special trip for us. My wife and I had an ultrasound earlier in the afternoon to determine whether our first child would be a boy or girl. Instead of finding out in the sterile doctor's office environment we had the nurse put the answer in an envelop and decided to go out to dinner and open it there, you know, make a night of it. We were seated promptly at one of the sidewalk tables and were quickly greeted for our drink orders; I decided to go with a glass of Argentina white wine. The only knock I have for Pannullo's is the lack of draft beers, but that's the only issue. Flipping through the menu I decided to finally give the Calzone a shot, having passed it up for more traditional chicken and pasta dishes in previous visits. I decided on the pepperoni and breshucto ham as fillings (along with the cheese) and also selected the \\"large\\" size. The waitress asked me if I was sure I wanted the large because, \\"it was enough for two people\\". Naturally I responded, \\"I am eating for two,\\" as kind of a pregnancy joke which didn't make sense unless I was that she-male guy on Oprah, but anyway. We had a order of breadsticks with cheese which was very good, with a side of marinara as dipping sauce. We also had side salads to warm us up for the meal as well, nothing spectacular, but right on par for the level style at the restaurant. When the meal arrived I realized exactly what the waitress was talking about, the Calzone could only be described as a purse of dough, meat, and cheese. The thing was massive, it took up a large plate and was shaped like a giant croissant, but I like to think it was shaped like a purse. The people at the table next to me were asking what I had ordered, and so they could see better, I picked it up like a purse and showed it to them saying it was, \\"my Calzone purse\\". Unimpressed, the couple gave a courteous half-laugh and went about their meal. I tackled the Calzone as best I could bet even I could not finish off much more than half of the meal. Lucky for me I was able to take it home were we had a \\"2nd date\\" the following night to finish things off. The food was top notch, and the Calzone itself was probably one of the most affordable meals on Park Ave at just under 15 bucks with all of the toppings, two people could easily split it as a meal.\\n\\nPannullo's is now in our regular restaurant rotation, the service, food, and dining experience are all excellent for the price range of the restaurant. I suggest forgoing a reservation and using their pager service so you can walk down the street to the Wine Room for a glass of vino before your meal.\\n\\nThe evening was fantastic, both with the food, and the fact that we were going to be parents to a baby girl!

So the whole table ended up ordering Peronis! We started off with the Lamb & Pork Meatballs which are served with stewed tomatoes and asiago cheese shaved on top. These little meatballs were delisssshhhhh... super moist!! Since there were four of us, the waitress suggested we order three pizzas... we chose the Bianca, the Margherita, and the Fennel Sausage. The Bianca was my favorite - I'm a sucker for arugula on a pizza. You could definitely taste a hint of citrus which was nice against the sharpness of the Romano cheese. I think the Fennel Sausage was the greasiest out of all three (not necessarily a bad thing!), but it also was the one that fell apart the easiest and had the soggiest crust. And hat's off to the waitress for suggesting we add Prosciutto to the Margherita pizza... everything is always better with fatty meats!!

We started off with the crawfish (good, especially w/ the side sauce (which was spicy without noticeable heat)) and fried green tomatoes (my first, better than I had expected.)  These came with little cornbread  muffins, dinner rolls (warm and light, very good) and sweet rolls (which I didn't try until the next day, so I'll withhold judgement on them.)  We also got the pot likker soup.  I ordered the fried chicken, recommended by our waiter as well as many previous writers.  While the frying technique was good (crunchy though not heavily battered), it was under-salted and under-seasoned (an opinion shared by another of our party who also ordered the chicken.)  The sweet potato souffle was the standout side dish, loaded with mini marshmallows.  Mac and cheese was delish, with lots of melty cheese on the top.  The spiced apples very quite good; the cheese grits, OK (not cheesy enough for me.)  Dessert had to be wedged in on top of everything preceding.  The banana pudding was my favorite.  The peanut butter pie was very heavy and not particularly peanuty.  It was one of the big disappointments of the night.  Strawberry shortcake was OK, nothing special.  Service was good: competent and friendly, I was willing to overlook his recommendation of the chicken.

I did slather them in A1 sauce, so I'm not entirely sure how they would hold up plain - probably still very good. However, the fries were bland, and the cucumber salad was just whole pieces of cucumber with some pepper chunks and a vinegary dressing. It wasn't bad, but I was just expecting more. I had only come here one other time when I was younger so I tried not to have too high of expectations. They were out of garlic mashed, their first side listed on the menu, and I think I remember other reviewers saying the same. If you are frequently out of something, don't advertise it!

There was definitely not enough compote to eat with all three pancakes. The pancakes were very... wet. I have never had ricotta pancakes, so I am not sure what the texture should be, but I chalked up the wetness/moistness to the ricotta. I mean, the pancakes were decent. I just wish they had given less and served them with some eggs and bacon or something. It is just too much pancakes for one person. \\n\\nAs for the BF's salad, I loved the combination of the goat cheese, strawberries, candied pecans and fresh baby spinach. It's a classic combination and totally delicious. Their tuna salad was a bit strange tasting though. Not that it had gone bad or anything, but it had a different sort of flavor. My BF said they had overdone it on the Italian seasoning or something. I have never heard of Italian seasoning in tuna salad. Oh, he ordered a half portion and it was absolutely gigantic -- it looked like a full portion at a normal place, so I can't imagine what Highland's full portion looks like.\\n\\nOnce I hit up all the brunch places on my to-try list, I will probably swing by Highland Bakery again.

This restaurant is excellent for people that care about where there food comes from. I appreciate that the Blue Dahlia offers vegan and gluten-free options as well, although I am not a vegan/vegetarian or need gluten-free food. I'm going to give you both experiences that I had:\\n\\n1st time: I go in and it takes them a good 5-10 minutes to get our drink order and then a while longer to come and take our food order. Keep in mind that we are told our waiter was a \\"he\\"; however, a woman came to take our order since she noticed we had been sitting there a while. I didn't think too much of it since they were busy, but things got weird towards the end. I ordered their chicken salad tartine and it was good, but nothing too amazing. When we asked for our check the waitress gave it to us, but yet the original waiter came by to pick it up and charge our cards. Keep in mind he only came around maybe once and the waitress was good about asking if we needed anything. So when we ask the guy if he can split the check with my tartine going to my card and my co-workers food going to hers (sound simple right?), the waiter proceeds to charge almost everything on my card, and give a couple of dollars back 0_o . We tracked down the waitress and she fixed the problem...Very strange service with decent, but not amazing food. \\n\\n2nd: My co-worker and I get seated and a much better waiter comes around (only one waiter this time, awesome!). I order a bacon and spinach frittata (I was in the mood for breakfast) and I enjoyed it, but again, it was decent food and not enough for me to say it was amazing. The service was much better this time though, so I appreciated that fact. \\n\\nAlthough I wouldn't strongly recommend this place to most people, it is close to where I work. Will I go here again? Probably...and only because it's so convenient. Blue Dahlia has a good thing going for them, but their food could be kicked up a notch and their service is hit or miss I guess.

The reservation was for 5pm.  We arrived a bit early so I could talk about accommodations for my shellfish allergy, as suggested, when calling about the menu. We were reassured that any allergies would be accommodated. We were literally the first and only people waiting at this time.  We were told that a large group having a meeting was running overtime and we were offered to wait in the bar (perhaps start reservations at 530 if you book meetings that end at 5pm), as soon as the group left they would set up the dining area and come get us. \\n\\nWe waited until 5:25pm and decided to go check on the delay and they apologized they forgot about us and offered to seat then.  We wanted a nice table in the window area, which 4 of the 6 were open, however, the host stated those are for parties of four, not two and no exceptions could be made.  Many people were already seated at the tables now and seating was limited.  I recently had a stroke and a brain injury and was on crutches with use of only one leg, our host showed no mercy in making me wiggle through the dining area, to a small 2 person table in the back with a blocked view. Within 5 minutes of being seated, they started seating parties of two at those front tables we were denied, which  would've been way nicer and accommodating for me with my limited mobility.  \\n\\nThe Portland Dining month menu is specific, 3 course meal with choice of 2 options per, one of the dished was: \\"LOMO SALTADO*: Cascade Natural Beef tenders wok-fried with onions, tomatoes, oyster sauce, garlic and aj√≠ amarillo, served with Yukon Gold papas fritas and garlic rice.\\"  We were told by the host, and our server that the \\"oyster sauce\\" would be held out of my entree' so that I could eat it.  It was after 6pm when the kitchen server brought out both plates and I asked which one is the oyster sauce free one and they said they both have it, but they are gluten free so it should be ok.  I was shocked because if I were to eat this it could be a trip to the hospital and I had just spent a month in one.  We asked for the manager and he did not come, minutes later our waiter came.  We explained the importance of food allergies, he agreed and said he would take the meals away and get new ones marked correctly.  This was not a joke, just replacing them was not ok.  I again asked for the manager and he finally came over and told us that the food would've been ok, as all their so called \\"oyster sauce\\" is vegan, meaning it doesn't even have oyster sauce in it. I was so upset from this scare, I was holding back tears, why on earth doesn't the host, kitchen or wait staff know this?  He said they just don't know, it's easier to say they could leave it out and he would take the meals away and get us hot new ones and would take care of us for our trouble. We were brought out an appetizer \\"chimicurri\\" on a tablespoon sized spoon, compliments of the manager.  We had drank 5 glasses of wine before our entree arrived.  Our waiter offered us more wine, however, I said I was driving and would drink water, he offered a coffee in a gratuitous way, so I said yes.  \\n\\nIn the end our experience: not seating us on time with reservations, forgetting to seat us, seating me in an inconvenient table across the dining area when closer tables were open, discriminating/refusing to seat us in the front booths and then giving \\"all four\\" of those seats within minutes to other 2 party guests, making me think they could've caused me serious harm by serving me shellfish, then overcharging us on our bill over $20 (3rd coarse \\"desserts\\" were charged on our bill in mistake, along with $4 charge for the cup of coffee and the appetizer) and no discount for \\"taking care of us.\\" Embarrassment requesting them to review the bill, which resulted in paying what we should owe. Then we had to try and figure out how to leave as I could not get through the now overly crowed room on my crutches (which they strongly suggested they have them checked for me, so I was literally unable to leave the table until they brought them back to me) dragging my bad leg, embarrassing us as we had to ask many customers to get up from their tables to clear a pathway. Yes, they could've done, but chose not to, do better when a patron has received such unacceptable service!  One star because allergies are real and taking care of mistakes is not just replacing food or removing overcharges.  I will add that we still tipped quite generously."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We roll up into Portland a little past midnight and thought we'd get our Portland experience started with Doughnuts from Voodoo even though we were exhausted from a long drive.

Everything was fabulous. Everyone is still talking about the wedding. Some said (not directly to us but we were told) it was the best wedding they had ever been to.\\n\\n The wedding coordinator/company was very thorough at making sure all the details were covered.\\nThere is a bridal suite on board, the staff was very helpful, the food was delicious and they even provided a DJ for a few extra hundred dollars. We went with the portside lunch menu which included all the appetizers and a buffet dinner with carved beef, salad, two pasta dishes (one with ample shrimp and mussels) and the appetizers were plentiful and scrumptious. With the portside menu the food is continuously replenished until everyone is done eating (which is great).  Also included were chocolate covered strawberries served with dessert. Our cake from Kondeiter Meisters was amazing.\\n\\nWe also chose to provide free beer and wine for our guests for the first hour and it was nice because the staff butlered beer and wine. Everyone was able to have a few in that first hour. After that the drinks were $6 to $8 each. The company offered us a $500 credit towards a drink package so it made the hour much more affordable.\\n\\nWe had our ceremony on the rooftop overlooking the Boston skyline, which limited our guests to 70 people. My only complaint of the ceremony was that a microphone was needed and the set up of the chairs made it impossible for me to walk down a full aisle with my father. If the staff had spent more time pondering the setup it would have been possible. That was my only real disappointment.\\n\\nIt was hard for the DJ to keep track of what was happening since the boat has 3 floors but everything went fine. The views were absolutely amazing. For a wedding I recommend 5 hours; we had 4 and it was too short. It is also not a handicap accesible boat, but the staff will help anyone who needs help walking or with stairs. \\n\\nYou also need to consider the conditions that will affect your wedding once leaving the dock: waves, wind, rain, other boats, etc. We happened to have a windy day with 2 minutes of rain right during the ceremony. There were sailboats everywhere.\\n\\nWe highly recommend a wedding on the Seaport Elite. The one downside is that the wedding coordinator who helps to plan your wedding may not be the one who is there on the day of and that can cause some small issues (ex. the chair and the aisle issue we had). You also are not expected to tip on top of the price for the wedding, although we did tip the food manager and the dj since everything was so great."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The brunch menu was moderately limited for dairy-free or vegan options, as most stuff contained cheese, eggs, or meat.

If we would have ordered three of these we would have been very happy.    The Vieux Carre cocktails we had with this were expertly prepared. \\n\\nThe bad: We got a number of small plates in addition to the ham, and every one of these had something disappointing.   I love fennel, but the level of the fennel in the chowder was overwhelming.   The ricotta stuffed dumplings were just blah.   The deviled eggs were deconstructed, the sauce as not inspired, and frankly, while not terrible, we both agreed that nearly other deviled egg we've had was tastier.

If you are looking to go on friday or saturday night, definitely make reservations in advance or you won't get in.\\n\\nA great feature is that this place is completely BYOB with no corkage fees! I've taken advantage of this several times and it's a huge plus for this restaurant.\\n\\nMy favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Korma.  Their garlic naan also goes very well with creamy sauce dishes like the ones I just mentioned.  Most of the dishes are around 10-14 dollars, so your final bill will come to about $20 per person, but you'll be completely stuffed.\\n\\nOn Tuesday-Thursday, you can usually get 25% off your bill through their paper coupons or by Yelp check-ins or other deals.\\n\\nThe service is excellent.  Everybody is very friendly and is willing to talk to you about every dish and describe them in detail.\\n\\nThere is one slight slight negative that comes with the friendly service.  And that is the fact that they can be a bit pushy with orders at times.  I know that this can be very common with Indian restaurants as well, but they do it more than other restaurants I know.  I'm not saying they are rude about it (in fact they are always extremely pleasant), but they really go out of their way to suggest foods.  Even if you say you're extremely full or you're only interested in one dish, they will constantly push for a dessert, or more naan, or a specialty drink.  I understand it's a business but that can be a little annoying at times.\\n\\nI plan to have many future visits to this place and just as many instances whereI get in trouble for mistaking my +1s."},{"name":"De Novo","address":"201 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This is definitely going in my \\"special occasion\\" column.

The workers did not look welcoming or friendly and were not helpful what so ever. The whole time I was there(about 20 minutes) I only saw ONE worker smile ONCE. I just shook it off as they were tired or something. When it was our turn to get our donuts, the cashier we had just stared at us so we just decided to point out the donuts because most of them didn't have names. This was our first time and didn't know how they work. My mom was trying to point out the donuts and the girl just kept staring at us and my mom thought it was because it was too loud in there to hear so my mom raised her voice a bit and the girl just kept staring at us(I learned after that they just type in the donuts then go back and pack them). After about 5 minutes of struggling, my aunt went to the next cashier who was open and asked for help which we received finally. This girl honestly wasn't much better. She got our orders in but she didn't look like she wanted to help. I'm usually not picky on customer service. Please just smile or at least help clarify things and I'll be perfectly happy.

Oh yeah, definitely count me in. What originally brought us out to Poor Calvin's was a Atlanta eater guide saying to try their lobster mac and cheese. And while the lobster mac and cheese brought us over the other dishes and service will keep us coming back! \\n\\n| LOCATION |\\n\\nPoor Calvin's is a popular spot for many reasons so be sure to come early to avoid the rush or do yourself a solid and make reservations before hand. If you do get lucky by coming early, enjoy your meal outdoors in their patio area or at one of their candle lit tables inside. Honestly, the size of this place is pleasantly deceiving. Seating looks limited in the front but as you walk farther past the bathrooms you'll soon come to realize that it's not so small after all. If you're driving they do have a small valet parking lot, but otherwise test your luck with parking in the area. \\n\\n| WHAT WE GOT | \\n\\n+ Lobster Mac & Cheese - So much yes and more! After the first bite I can see why this is a city favorite. The pasta was a mix of different types of noodles that blended perfectly with all the cheese. You would think they would skimp out on the lobster but no sir, no. The whole appetizer was mixed well and didn't taste too oily even with all the cheese. It was so good that it tasted even better the next day. \\n\\n+ Softshell Crab - A whole crab served in a pineapple. I repeat served in a pineapple. The crab was covered in just the right amount of batter and the tangy sauce they paired it with was delicious. Add all the ingredients on a spoonful of rice and bam. In addition to already what's on your plate they add a ton of veggies that break up the fried components of the dish. The best part though was eating the pineapple chunks that soaked up all the flavors. \\n\\n+ Duck Dynasty - The duck was tender and plenty! I will say that I did prefer the sauce that came with the crab a little more, but it was still pretty good. I really liked the addition of the tiger shrimp because it added a nice grilled flavor contrast to the duck breast and were huge! The mash they paired it with was on the sweeter side (sweet potato or something along those lines)\\n\\nSadly we didn't have any room left for dessert, but I guess that's another reason for us to come back.\\n\\n| SERVICE| \\n\\nService here was superb and out waiter was one for the books.

I looked the website up to get their number to call for a saturday night reservation, but all I had to do was fill out a simple form online and my reservation was set.  \\n\\nWe got there on time and were seated in just a few minutes.  The whole space is very small, but the lighting was low and romantic, and though the seating was very simple, the atmosphere was warm, though not quiet due to the full saturday night crowd and close seating.  Not a problem- we were still able to have a great conversation across the table throughout the meal.\\n\\nWe ordered the cheese and meat platter for an appetizer and it was good- 4 exquisitely soft and toasted slices of focaccia with an assortment of bits of cheese, pickles, and piles of prosciutto, which I generally don't like, but I did try and really liked the ham (which I also hadn't seen before).  FYI my husband said he thought the other prociuttos were ok.  Not great.\\n\\nWe both had tall, cold glasses of their Italian beer which was all I could ask for in a light beer- crisp, almost cider-like, and served at the perfect temperature.  For this alone I could return, believe it or not.\\n\\nThe pizza was really delicious, and truely Italian!  Soft and smokey thin crust!  Tangy, fresh tomato sauce! Buttery, melt-in-your-mouth mozzarella!  Delectable herbs!  And the sausage was really unbelievable- so flavorful and intense.  My only wish is that the pizzas were larger so the topping area would be larger in proportion to the crust edge.  But I really can't complain much.\\n\\nAlthough we had several slices of pizza leftover to take home, we ordered one \\"piece\\" of cheesecake for desert, which I thought I would take one or two bites of.  HA!  Now, this place serves SOME of the best pizza in Austin, but let me say- THIS IS THE BEST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER EATEN.  It comes in a little glass crock and the cheesecake is almost like a yogurt (and NOT in the low fat, healthy way!) with the \\"crust\\" and the most delicious cherries I have ever eaten spooned on top.  Dear God.  That dessert changed my tastebuds' lives.  \\n\\nI definitely recommend this place for a date of any kind.  I think it's a bit more expensive than probably most of the pizza places in Austin, but I also hear they have a sweet happy hour.

Plus I'd like to end on a happy note, cause they deserve it.\\n\\nHere are the cons, and I almost hate to do this, but it's a big one: the coffee.  The regular, house, drip coffee.  It is almost always bad.  Its bitter, and never hot.  I would advise them to REALLY work on this.  I try off and on to order the regular coffee here, and am disappointed every time.  And they are almost always out of decaf.  Stick to one of the specialty coffees if you need caffeine.  Heres another thing that bothers me:  They serve WHOLE WHEAT bagels, and call them plain.  If you like whole wheat bagels, and want to order one, fine.  But if your heart is set on a plain bagel, do not order the plain bagel, because it is not a plain bagel.  It is whole wheat.  Crunchy, grainy, wheaty whole wheat.  You've been warned. \\n\\nThere are many pros.  The atmosphere is friendly, mellow and homey, albeit slightly hipsterish, but that doesn't really bother me.  Its clean, and bright, and open, with a cool rotation of local art displayed on the walls.  Its surrounded by greenery, and that's always pleasant.  Plus, they've got a really nice patio where you can bring your dog.  If you are vegetarian, you're in luck, because they serve no meat here.  But even if you aren't you will enjoy the breakfasts, lunch, and deserts they serve here.  The prices are great because they vary widely, and if you're really poor at the moment, you can always order one or two of the basic tacos for just a couple bucks.  Its a great place to have a conversation with a friend, as their music is truly background music, unlike a lot of local cafes and restaurants that tend to blast their stuff.  There is usually no wait to get in.  I would recommend almost everything on their menu, but my favorites are the basic tacos, the soul food plate, and the wanna-BLT.  They serve a good mocha too, have a nice variety of teas, and all their deserts are delicious.  And everything is served on funky, mismatched, thrift store plates, and mugs.  Fun. :)"},{"name":"The Bancroft","address":"15 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"How many wonderful things can you say about one place? Who knows, but I am going to try.

Sweet Cheats is run by a husband-wife team and it came about because the wife is a fitness competitor and during the off season (or when she just needed to cheat on her clean diet), she started coming up with her own treats to satisfy her sweet tooth. Apparently her creations caught enough that they realized they had a great, marketable idea on their hands and thus, Sweet Cheats was born.\\n\\nThe store is located in Cabbagetown, but if you can't make it to the storefront, which is very cute and cozy, you can order any of their treats online and have them shipped to you. Treats include cupcakes, macarons (the French kind), cake pops, cheesecakes, cookie cars and brownies and of course a slew of coffee drinks and ciders. \\n\\nFlavors vary depending on the season and what the owners feel like making that day, but for my first try I got the Notorious Nutella cupcake and a Luscious Lemon macaron with lemon lavender infused creme. OMG to them both!! The macaron was light and airy but at the same time chewy and not too sweet - lovely, lovely, lovely! And the cupcake - it was very nearly a sugar overload, and if I was diabetic the insulin would have been working overtime by the end of that cupcake. Although the cupcakes aren't outsized they pack a wallop of sweetness and sugar within. Chocolately, with big swirls of Nutella and a Nutella infused icing on top. Beautiful and deadly at the same time.\\n\\nIt was great. While I definitely can't indulge in something like this on a regular basis (and hope to still fit into my jeans), I would definitely come back to taste another flavor of cupcake in the future for a cheat-worthy occasion.

They have a decent beer and wine selection as well. The food is what brings the score down here. The first time I got wings and they were subpar. The Asian ginger flavoring on the wings wasn't anything to write home about. During my second trip I got a grilled cheese and the Balboa salad.

The place is tired and worn out, and you get the feeling it used to be quite the place in its hey day, which looks like it may have been the early 80's.  Because of this, I ordered the chicken parm, which is usually the old standby for older places.  The chicken was good, but the spaghetti that it came on was undercooked and hard.  So, an Italian place that can't cook spaghetti.  My wife ordered something that was so underwhelming, I can't even remember what it was, but I remember discussing how bad it was with her and not taking it home.  Our yungins got some chicken fingers which were fine, and it was a kid friendly place, especially since we were the only ones there until another family arrived.  The highlight of the meal was the bread and homemade butter we got when we sat down....delicious.  Also, friendly waitress.  I wish it was better, because the price was right  and I was hoping to be able to go back there in a pinch with the kids, but not the case.

We were told \\"Yes it is. I gave you two of everything that you asked for per meal!\\". Now that was an issue for me because I don't use Mayo , so as I was trying to explain to this young lady that I don't need Mayo when she actually sighed as if we were wasting her time or getting on her nerves. All I could do is think \\"This heifer!\\" as I sat in my co-workers car. \\n\\nIf I had been driving then we might still be there because the condiment bag looked a little light for 24 packets of condiments. Any who. Once we got back to the office we all noticed that we had cold waffle fries, only two packets of ketchup, two packets of Mayo, two packets of BBQ sauce and two packets of Honey BBQ sauce. Now the sandwiches were warm and the beverages were right but cold/hard fries and no condiments totally messes up a meal for me. I could have gotten us three Hot Dog combos from Sam's today for $1.50 and have added three pretzels for a fraction of the cost of these $20 worth of meals.\\n\\nNot only that, but the cashier according to the receipt is Florence.

I'm just going to say it - I love everything about this restaurant.\\n\\nFirst, I love the easy parking. That may seem odd, but I've gotten a bit tired lately of valets in tiny, packed lots, or worse, hard to find street parking. Nice sized lot off Howell Mill (big sign so you don't miss it) and lots of parking off 8th Street. \\n\\nOyster Bar at The Optimist is the casual bar that I can see myself spending many a post-work early evening at sipping a cold beer or glass of white wine (highly recommend the Beach Ball) and indulging in some briny oysters or peel and eat shrimp.\\n\\nStep into The Optimist proper and you will be amazed at the attention to detail, the great service, the fun little touches that don't hit you over the head with a nautical theme and better still - the amazing food.\\n\\nThey start you with delicious house made rolls topped with maldon salt. Some of the dishes cry out for these rolls to sop up the savory broths, including the garlicky tiny clams & pork belly with hand-torn croutons dish - so save some for that or just order more. The fried clam roll with kimchi vinegar and house pickles was also a winner on a Holeman & Finch bun. They also feature of course, oysters on the half shell. East and West Coast oysters made you feel like you were seaside with various accompaniments including crackers, hot sauce, cocktail sauce and real horseradish.\\n\\nWhile the restaurant features skirt steak, wood roasted half amish chicken, roasted heritage pork and lamb belly, the focus is definitely on seafood. We enjoyed the alaskan halibut, wood grilled hen of the wood with red wine fish bordelaise and the skate wing \\"schnitzel\\" with brown butter, charred lemon, and capers. So delicious\\n\\nThe sides are also amazing - I wanted to try them all! Ended up with the potato gnocchi with lobster butter and corn and the sliced local heirloom tomatoes with louie dressing.I'll be back to try the buttered spring onion potato puree and corn milk hushpuppies.\\n\\nOne of the cooler things I stumbled upon on the way to the restroom were two racks of old school hotel style keys. Puzzled, I thought maybe I needed one to open the restroom door, but the doors had no key locks. Chef Ford Fry happens by as I'm looking very confused about these bright orange keys and explains that they printed 1,000 of these keys and they are for the patrons to take. Score! I promptly scooped up #177. What I'm hoping is that eventually when all 1,000 keys are taken that those keyholders will be able to bring them back to 'unlock' a special plate on the menu. Appetizer, entree, dessert, doesn't matter. \\n\\nI cannot forget dessert. I was leaning towards the fried pound cake with ice cream, fudge and fried peanuts, but went with the ice box cake of the day - lemon. Cool and refreshing! My boyfriend (a chef!) was a bit more adventurous and got the buttermilk doughnuts with sweet corn ice cream and hot pepper jam.\\n\\nI mentioned earlier in this post that I loved everything about this restaurant and it's true.

For me, ketchup wasn't just for fries and burgers. It was for eggs, pickles, cheese sticks, meatloaf, and even rice. When I worked in a restaurant on Newbury Street I used to expiriment with some odd combinations as well such as green beans and hot fudge (don't knock it till you try it). Needless to say I don't shy away from trying new and unusual dishes. \\n\\nThinking back, there really is not a whole lot that's unusual about Crispy Crepes on Park Drive in the Fenway Area besides they are closed on Friday mornings. Come to think about it, there's really not a whole that stands out either. I got hooked on their pancakes more so than anything else they serve. They make some Chocolate-Chip-Coconut pancakes that are absolutely out of this world! No, I did not pour ketchup on them, however, all of my friends felt like the chocolate-chip-coconut combination was quite odd. I would always ask them: \\"Haven't you ever had an almond joy\\"? \\n\\nThe chocolate-coconut (choconut as I call it) combo in a pancake is out of this world. Of course, I drown it it syrup which only makes it better. Once I had these I never turned back. I never have even given their crepes a chance because I feel like if I order something else other than those pancakes I would be cheating on the choconut combo. I can't do that, it's just not humane in my eyes. \\n\\nBesides my love for the pancakes at Crispy Crepes the place is tiny! You need to go there early if you want to sit at a table. They don't really have a bathroom. I mean to relieve yourself you need to walk through the kitchen. In a place this small I'd hold it till you get back home. \\n\\n3 stars is good for this place. They should re-locate though. They are tucked behind the 7-11 near the BU dorms where they are not visable to street-walkers on Beacon St. I'm sure their crepes are great but honestly, you touch my pancakes and I'll never talk to you again. :-)"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"bacon maple bar.........enough said :)\\nOk real review......good doughnuts, fun atmosphere but be prepared to wait in a big line.

But as I ate it, I started to be slightly dissatisfied by the texture of the caramelized onions on it.  They were just too thick and tough, almost as if it was the outer section of the onion.  I imagine that might just be a one time issue, but it really affected my overall enjoyment so I'm docking a star.  \\n\\nI also tried the molten chocolate cookie which was indeed molten and chocolate.

I heard someone tell the owner that this was the closest food that he has tasted that he used to get in California which I think is a pretty good compliment. We will be back with our friends and family. This place is always busy. There are four tables inside and tables outside.

The fennel sausage pizza had maybe a 1/4 link's worth of sausage (that's being generous). For the $15 cost, I expected more toppings. Lastly, the service was quick but at the expense of the crust. Of the 4 pizzas we ordered, all of them had soggy under crust. It was essentially uncooked in some spots. I don't recommend this restaurant.

It's now run by new owners who kept the same name and now-fading d√©cor, while jettisoning any quality or grasp of basic culinary principles.  My friend and I ate there last night and it was a disaster.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, there was one other table occupied.  Over the course of our time there, four more tables entered, three of those parties exiting within seconds of viewing the menu.  I regret that we lacked the same initiative.\\n\\nThe menu boasts eight items.  You read that right: there are a grand total of eight things that this restaurant makes, and that includes only two things (mussels and a croquet madame) that could even remotely be called French.  In short, La Brasserie IS NOT A BRASSERIE.\\n\\nNow of course, if you make eight things brilliantly, then who's to complain?  Not here.  When I asked the waiter if anything else was on offer, he told us only one thing: the news that they had no mussels.  So strike that -- the place cooks seven things, with appetizers comprising those light palate-whetters known as poutine and croquet madame.\\n\\nThe kitchen was alarmingly uninspired, lacking the imaginative or technical ability to assay even the most remedial of specials.  I'll only list a few details.  Firstly, there's a shocking lack of vegetables, not a salad to be found.  My friend had two ribs served on nothing but a vast mound of french fries.  Me, I had the lamb cheeks (that's all it was: the cheeks of lamb cooked to the consistency and appearance of... well...) on an equally copious plate of cooked-to-mush fusilli (who doesn't know how to boil pasta?) streaked with some thin, flavourless tomato-like gruel.  The food looked terrible (you'll find better presentation at the Denny's across the street), it tasted bland, and showed no evident grasp of what people actually like to eat.\\n\\nI had ordered one of the six cocktails on their menu, and was informed that it was not available, for want of a simple bottle of red vermouth.  (There's a liquor store around the corner.)  Service was with a smile, ranging from apologetic to impervious.  We'd asked for our wine to be on ice (it was red, but came HOT, given where it's stored) and later learned that they'd given us a half-dozen mini cubes in the bottom of the sleeve.  Even ice is in short supply at La Brasserie.\\n\\nIn short, the reviews and photos you read here bear no resemblance to what you'll find should you show up tonight.\\n\\nSo how does this place stay in business?

Fave ramen bowls are the garlic lovers' and the Spicy Umami with ground pork. SO GOOD. You can also add a ton of customized toppings, which is one of my favorite services Jinya offers. Go for the fresh garlic (free!), which comes out with a garlic press so you can add it to your heart's content. I'm also a big fan of the seaweed, corn, and poached egg.\\n\\nIf you're super hungry, the appetizers are super solid too. The Brussels sprouts are my personal favorite but they are all good!

They do the same \\"tricks\\" a hibachi grill does but with much less enthusiasm and with drastic stinginess.\\n\\nVery stingy portions and... Want your rice stir fried? $3 more. Want an actual vegetable included? $5 up charge. That onion they make the volcano thing with? You don't get to eat it, they throw it away. You know at hibachi grills how they always make an abundance and share with people who maybe didn't order something and everyone has enough for a to go box? No, you won't even leave full, but you will pay double for it.\\n\\nNeither the food nor the experience provides anything exceptional or in ANY way better flavored than a typical hibachi.

This place thinks way too highly of itself based on pure location.\\n\\nSushi menu is somewhat watered down if that's what you're going for. The birthday boy wanted to try a bunch of different things so he ordered the sampler/chef's pick.

The waiter made it clear he wasn't even willing to submit that request.\\n\\nUpon arrival the sushi selections were basic and mediocre. He didn't like that the tuna was seared and not raw. There was no uni, so i asked the waiter to bring him a plate of just uni ($12 for two pieces!) and 20 minutes later he came back and said they were out of it. \\n\\nSERVICE\\nEveryone working except the hostesses seemed miserable and trying to do as little possible. Not an iota of hospitality. All ten people in our party were as underwhelmed by the service as we were the food... we are laid back easy-to-please people, but I guess you get higher expectations when you're dropping a Benjamin and still leave hungry. It was also clear that despite all the open hibachi grills around us and that it wasn't late that they wanted to rush us out. The check was delivered and staff trying to clear everything possible when I still had half my food left.\\n\\nBIRTHDAYS\\nHere's the best part about the whole thing... What are they going to do for your birthday? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I get it, they're trying to be classy (not doing well, but trying) and don't want singing in their restaurant. But comped sake? Nope! Comped dessert? No way! Stingy on all fronts.\\n\\nSUMMARY \\nAll in all, if you want to pay a lot for really good sushi or hibachi, I'd say do it elsewhere. It's clear that management here is greedy and pretentious and that the whole staff including the chefs are miserable and don't want you there. It wasn't a mystery why they were half empty on a Saturday night. I was embarrassed for picking this place and subjecting all my friends to such an overpriced meal that was so lackluster, as well as a very disappointing birthday experience for my boyfriend."},{"name":"Sweet Cheats","address":"692-B Kirkwood Ave SE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazinnng!

I'm trying really hard to write the most accurate review from my experience and its difficult cuz its so mixed. To begin, I have had Poor Calvin's on my list to try for 3 months now and was excited to finally find time to go on Monday. The pictures looked awesome and the menu looked great. The decoration and atmosphere of the place was very unique and somewhat intimate. Everything started very well. \\n\\nOur party went ahead and ordered some wine and appetizers. We had the Seafood Spring Rolls, Grilled Octopus, and Steamed Dumplings. This is where everything started going not so well. The spring rolls were ok, flavors were over powered by salt and soy, and the filling was rather mushy. The grilled octopus wasn't bad except I wish there were a little more char on the outside of the octopus to give it a better texture. The dumplings though were horrible... I really couldn't understand how it was $8 for 5 dumplings that seemed like they were from a large costco bag. The preparation of it was nothing special either, worse if anything. The wrap was overcooked(too soggy) and could've been the reason why the filling was bland. Overall pretty disappointed with the appetizers so far. \\n\\nFor my main course, I had the Pad Thai Tiger Shrimp. Pros, lots of massive shrimp. Very big thumbs up. Cons, lots of dense noodles, flavor that is nothing like Pad Thai. The shrimp was great, well cooked and flavorful. The noodles though felt like a heavy blob.I tried to pick the shrimp out from inside the noodles and it was difficult to find even though they were large shrimps. The flavor also did not resemble anything close to pad thai... I understand that it's fusion but this just didn't fuse well... \\n\\nOverall, I had high expectations but they weren't anywhere near met.

Somewhat incongruous, but the whole is greater than the some of the parts.  The modern bar and those comfy looking leather seats are calling us back to try the bar burger.\\n\\nTownsman has an interesting wine list, but pre-show cocktails and apps did the trick for us, such as the \\"EL DIABLO\\" (Chinaco Blanco tequila, lime, Lejay Cassis, house ginger beer) for $12.\\n\\nI recommend grabbing seats at the 10-seat \\"Crudo Bar\\" for a great view of the kitchen (although it is somewhat uncomfortable, lacking anywhere to perch your feet) and, more importantly, the busy charcuterie station.  Which is exactly where you should start your meal.  Offering a selection of housemade terrines, sensational charcuterie from Moody's Delicatessen & ProvisionsÔøΩ?(including a salami custom made for Townsman), and artisanal hams from Kentucky and Tennessee, one can easily make a great meal, quite reasonably, from only this part of the menu.  Our 4 terrines ($32) ran the gamut from creamy duck liver to rustic chicken pate and were accompanied by soft bread (as usual, never enough!), a wide assortment of housemade pickles, candied nuts, and some insanely delicious Baboo's (sp?) mustard, which is apparently based on Matt's grandmother's recipe.  If you do want to stay with the first column of the menu, a variety of cheeses and raw dishes (oysters, fish crude, beef tartare) are also offered.\\n\\nAlthough the appetizers and entrees sounded enticing, we decided to finish our meal off with a selection of hors d'oeuvres, all of which were a reasonable size for sharing by 2 or even 3. \\n\\nDEVILED EGGS: With fried capers, clapy pepper, crispy hen skin ($8) ~ Something of a deconstruction, this is undoubtedly going to be one of their signature dishes, creamy but with just the right balance of contrasting elements.\\n\\nCRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS: With malt vinegar aioli, pork fat crouton, harissa spice ($9) ~ Yeah, everyone and his Mom roasts brussels sprouts, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be on your menu too, and these were REALLY well roasted.  A delicious dish.\\n\\nBROILED SNAIL TOAST: With foraged mushrooms, onion jam, black vinegar ($10) ~ With a sweet rich sauce highlighting the tender snails, I would have preferred the toast to be a bit more crusty.\\n\\nAn excellent, quick meal before the Amiee Mann/Billy Collins show at Sanders Theatre.

The difference is the prosciutto, which adds another $1 to the already inflated price.\\n\\nWhile I waited for my sandwich to be hand crafted, I picked out a small bag of chips from the good selection they had and found myself checking out the cookies behind the counter. By the time my wallet came out, the total bill for my girlfriend and I was $24. But hey, this is quality food we're talking here, right? It must be worth the money.\\n\\nThere are a couple tables outside (and by that I mean exactly 2), so we grabbed one and sat down. Having a table didn't seem to help much since it was on a permanent 30¬∫ slant and my drink kept sliding off. I think I've seen people throw out better furniture than this on trash day.\\n\\nSo how was the food? As for the $7 Dissertation, I imagine I'd rather have written one than eat this sandwich. It was bland, lacked any real substance, and was hardly enough food for an average human being. The giant peanut butter cookie I snacked on afterwards was dryer than the Mojave desert, probably due to the fact that they're left on a tray on the counter rather than sealing them in some sort of container. In fact, the only thing worth eating was my bag of chips, which obviously wasn't \\"handcrafted\\" by Oxford Spa Cafe.\\n\\nA few days later I went back to give the Spa another try, this time for breakfast, and realized that it just wasn't worth my time or money. I ordered a breakfast burrito, which was pretty much just some egg, peppers and tomato in a tortilla, as well as an iced coffee. When preparing my tasty beverage, which flowed out of a big metal canister, the guy working behind the counter was kind enough to open a small Coleman cooler to grab (with his bare hands) a few ice cubes to put in my drink.\\n\\nIf you truly want to overpay for a sandwich, but would actually like to eat something tasty, skip Oxford Spa Cafe and head to Darwin's in Harvard Square. The people are friendlier, the food is much better, and they have beer & wine to wash it all down with. Plus you won't have to listen to annoying children yelling at a playground across the street."},{"name":"Heritage Golf Links","address":"4445 Britt Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"3","text":"Greens were punched recently, wasn't aware that they were.

Is it inappropriate to say real Italian food is better than _ _ _ in a review?\\n\\nWe visited Frasca's new bistro last night, and, having just come back from the boot-shaped peninsula 3 weeks ago, I can say their appetizers and pizzas tasted really authentic. The food is supposed to be based on cuisine from the Napoli region; whatever it is, it really does taste like bella Italia. Here's my take on it:\\n\\nAmbiance:\\n\\nAt 7pm on a Wednesday night, the place was packed. We put our names in, gave them my phone number, and mozied around Pearl St. for half an hour before getting called to an open table. \\n\\nInside, a high ceiling, big photos of Italian scenes, a wide, stainless bar, and open pizza cooking area with an oven that looked like a giant mosaic R2D2 made for an open-air, Euro ambiance. Seating was a little tight. Frankly, the acoustics suck, it's the kind of place where you have to yell to be heard.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nThe water is served in an appealing long-necked jar and fizzed on-site. It's good water. Their excellent wine list features wines from around the world, with lengthy explanations of taste, great for wine nerds. They also have a good selection of beers and Italian-style cocktails.\\n\\nWe had the arugula salad with shaved parmesan. A light dressing and aromatic arugula--better than the stuff you usually find at stores--made this a satisfying salad. I had a pizza with pomodoro sauce, arugula and prosciutto, and good Lord, that prosciutto melted in my mouth. Not sure how meat can be delicate and aromatic enough to actually melt, but theirs did. \\n\\nSO got a manly, musky, garlicky pizza with sausage; it was also delicious. Their fancy imported R2D2 oven makes a tantalizing crust that is thin and crispy on the bottom, with a rind that is crusty on the outside and fluffy-soft on the inside.\\n\\nDid I mention that this is the best pizza I've had in Colorado? \\n\\nOur wine was fruity, fizzy and well-chosen. As with the Frasca down the street, these people know their wines. \\n\\nService:\\n\\nOur waiters were very attentive and happy to entertain my questions about the R2D2 oven and whether their silverware had real lava in it (it doesn't, it's plastic made to look like lava). I feel confident that you could ask them anything about the wine or food. They're also kinda cute in their all-black outfits, coupled with colorful Converse All-Stars.\\n\\nOur pizza meal, with wine and salad, cost $36 each.

Hot dogs: delicious, but smaller than a typical \\"chicago\\" dog...not that I'm complaining. It's more than enough food.\\n\\n2. Fried chicken and waffles: best fried chicken I've ever had. Hands down. I want to bathe in the fry batter, which you can call disgusting only after you take a bite of this little gem. I promise you'll agree with me.\\n\\n3. Eggs: waaay too buttery and overcooked\\n\\n4. Mimosas: $7 for a teeny-tiny mimosa? Really? Aren't you the home of the $2 Lone Star tall-boy? Do you really think we're in Manhattan? In fact, now that I think of it, everything at brunch was a little too expensive for a place that serves $3 hot dogs. \\n\\n5. Atmosphere: very nice...bright and airy, plus the DJ played the perfect music for a Sunday morning.\\n\\n6. Service: excellent, except for the pushy bar-waiter-guy (what do you call someone who only waits tables in the bar area? No idea) who lurked over us while we waited for the rest of our party until we all ordered something. High-pressure drink sales on a Sunday morning? Too much, buddy.\\n\\nVerdict: Brunch was not a highlight. I didn't like enough of the menu items to make it worth my while and the drinks were waaayyy too expensive. I'd rather pay a couple extra bucks and go to Moonshine for more options of the same food, only better prepared (except for the chicken...dear god, it's amazing). \\n\\nAs for lunch and dinner, great place to grab a dog and a beer."},{"name":"Gracie's","address":"729 SW 15th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here for Sunday brunch after going on an epic walking journey.

The place is nice looking however has a subtle tourist vibe (not a big deal really).\\nOur party were shown into a large dining room  to the right of the building (looking from the front door), which was a few degrees too cold for most of the folks at the table not a deal breaker really. We figured some drinks would keep us warm. On that note many of the group were pleased to see the bar in Mary Macs as most expected it to be dry.\\nWe ordered cocktails and a beer. They arrived shortly after. The beer was fine. the waitress was a bit of a mess though. The drink tray had 3 drinks on it. a regular Martini, a beer and a white Russian. I  got the beer my friend had the martini and then the waitress stared at the small glass with milk and Kaluah and asked: \\"who ordered the .....French connection?\\". I'm not going to go over the top here but, have you ever seen a white Russian before? It's impossible to confuse it for anything else! \\nWe had ordered several more drinks which showed up just a moment later on another tray. All of our drinks arrived correctly. Then we tried them... my beer was... a beer 10/10, the white Russian, decent 9/10 the remaining French Connection, Mint Julep, Vodka Martini and Apple Martini all tasted virgin...very virgin. most of these drinks are pretty easy to tell when there's booze in it. Bartender big fail 2/10. \\n\\nWe ordered with the tickets which was fun...I guess. The food all came out together which is excellent. It sucks to go out as a group and have people without food or make everyone with food wait. so this was good. I'm sure they're used to large crowds in there as our table for 8 was no problem.\\nMary Mac's comes on strong with the bread!

Everyone was satisfied. no one was impressed or blown away. The same quality food can be found all over the city. Not bad by any means but nothing special either. \\nI guess one strange part which I can hardly believe I wasn't aware of was the ....hospitality staff.

I'm going to list the good things about this place first:\\n\\n-The service. Our waitress was extremely friendly and patient. \\n-The place is way less broke-down looking than it appears at first glance. From the outside, one pictures a dank, desolate cesspool of sketchiness and questionable business practices within. It's actually quite pleasant, clean-looking and well-lit. Needless to say, I was shocked.\\n-The sushi isn't too bad. It's no Fugakyu, sure, but it's certainly edible. \\n\\nNow the not-so-good things: the salad was really unimpressive. Someone else mentioned iceberg lettuce and WAY too much spicy dressing that was just plopped onto the salad. Ditto. The karaoke videos are bad, and not so-bad-it's-good-bad. Just bad. There are maybe three different videos in heavy rotation, including one showing scenes from a car show in Japan. However, there is one completely cheesed-out video of a guy and a girl that was clearly shot with a soft-focus lens and looked like a montage from one of the lower-rent Lifetime movies. Also, the captioning is definitely off on most of the songs. The song selection is much less than stellar, and sometimes the titles are written in \\"Engrish\\", and the books are arranged according to song title instead of artist, which can be very tricky if you're not used to that.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the karaoke aspect of Maluken. This really has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, but the clientele. Oh, the clientele. We were seated in front of a table of some of the douchiest BU Polo shirt douches that ever douched, who were doing sake bombs and completely drowning out any chance for conversation. Once karaoke started at 9:30, all bets were off. Maluken had been infiltrated by choads singing Nickelback and \\"Barbie Girl\\". So clearly, Maluken is less of a place for people who really love karaoke and more of an outlet for drunk BU assholes to show their true colors and make fools of themselves with the aid of A/V equipment. Charming.\\n\\nI doubt I'll be back here, since I try to avoid Kenmore like the plague, but maybe I'd come during the day. I'm certainly not coming back for karaoke."},{"name":"The Friendly Toast - Burlington","address":"75 Middlesex Tpke, Ste 1015B","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"We could not be happier they came to this area.

I was especially excited to check Andina out because I haven't yet tried Peruvian cuisine at a more upscale restaurant. My excitement for the place came to a screeching halt starting with my drink. \\n\\nDrink: 1 Star *\\nAlma de Picaflor is the house special cocktail consisting of Pisco, vodka, tea of cucarda (hibiscus) blossoms and rose water, lime leaves, and lime juice. It was interesting which is why I ordered it but it had this bitter cough medicine aftertaste. There wasn't good balance of flavors. \\n\\nFood:\\n1) Anticuchos de pulpo (5 Stars*****) - grilled octopus Skewers with chimichurri and caper manado de papa. Holy crap! That was so damn delicious. I don't know too many restaurants that can make octopus that tender and flavorful. I wasn't even using a particularly sharp knife and it cut the octopus like it was butter. I'd come back just for the octopus. \\n\\n2) Cebiche de pescado \\"5 Elementos\\" (3 Stars***) consists of fish in Leche de tigre (tiger's milk?). I'm a fan of lime but there is also such a thing as too much lime. On the bright side, there was a nice kick and the sweet potato soft and delicious. \\n\\n3) Lomo Saltado (2 Stars**) - beer tenders wok-fried with onions, tomatoes, fried potatoes, and rice. I think it's catered to certain palates because it was way too damn saucy! The quality of the beef was stellar but the amount of overpowering sauce destroyed this dish. The amount of rice they provided wasn't enough to dilute the amount of sauce they used.\\n\\nService: my server didn't seem like she wanted to be working. She was aloof and didn't seem like she cared about my experience. \\n\\nOverall: I picked the popular items but 2/3 were very disappointing because one flavor just completely dominated and I couldn't handle it.

Well, she wound up hitting the nail on the head with two white wine varietals that were so refreshing + tasty.  A definite MUST TRY on the menu are the Causas, which are essentially little stacks of mashed potatos stuffed with all sorts of goodies -- one was a purple [YES, purple!] potato stack stuffed with chicken, the other had different bits from the sea, like Ahi tuna and shrimp.  They were plated so meticulously, you almost didn't want to eat them.\\n\\nFor my entree, I chose the Yellowtail -- and in a last minute spontaneously spontaneous decision, my date ordered the Duck.  While my dish was good, his was far superior to mine in terms of overall taste and complexity.  Whatever it was paired with -- we think it was some sort of risotto? -- was so flavourful, it made you want to cry.\\n\\nWe polished off the meal with a single delicious dulce de leche cookie + a glass of sweet Port.

My dish looked like Indian butter chicken ..it was mild, pieces of chicken (breastmeat which I appreciated) and potato in curry sauce.  The naan was okay, it was definitely fresh but I have had better...I dont like that it was cut into wedges like a pizza...I like my naan whole and to tear it myself.  \\n\\nThey do have a large vegetarian menu which I might want to try next time.  The owner and his staff is very friendly...almost too friendly to the point that I feel a bit uncomfortable (if that makes any sense).

I appreciated the fact that the patty seemed to be made fresh, in-house (brown rice and veggies) but it fell apart immediately. I was essentially eating a sandwich and spearing the rice/veggie patty with my fork as it fell off into chunks (and then tinier pieces) all over my plate. The burger patty wasn't  flavourful and didn't do much for me, to be honest. Couldn't taste the aged cheddar either, and I'm someone who isn't too fond of cheese to begin with!\\n\\nThe service was wonderful the first time around (the waitress even brought out a slice of watermelon with a candle in it for my friend, whose birthday it was! So cute!). The patio out back was gorgeous. Absolutely great area to eat brunch on a hot summer day.\\n\\nI went back again the week after with my co-worker on a weekday , this time to actually try something off the brunch menu. It was freezing outside so I found it very strange that they had the front pull-down gate/window thing (which separates the front patio from the inside dining room) open.  My co-worker went out to her car and brought us scarves to wear because so much cold air was coming in through the open window.  Our server eventually closed the window/gate thing . I overheard one of the staff members say he wouldn't put the heat on when one of the wait staff mentioned how cold it was inside... that irked (and confused) me. \\n\\nI ordered the cranberry-ginger french toast  ($8) with the berry compote ($2) and my co-worker got the California Benny ($10), her fave. OMG. That french toast was amazing! Huge, thick slices (there were 4, I guess two slices, each cut in half?) with this delicious, decadent compote on top. It was pretty much dessert on a plate. The french toast had chunks of  ginger inside and mmm mmm mmm it was to die for. I am drooling thinking about it right now.\\n\\nThe only thing that ruined that absolutely perfect meal was just how freaking COLD it was! Oh well. Service was standard, a little on the slow side even though there were only 4 people (my friend and I included) inside the restaurant.\\n\\nOverall, 3.5 stars.

The broth is very flavorful, the ramen tastes very fresh, and it's not too thick like other places such as Sapporo. I love spicy foods, so their spicy dishes were actually not as spicy as one might think, it's like a child kicking your shin in comparison versus other Ramen places like Pikaichi which is like Christiano Ronaldo kicking your shin.\\n\\nThings I Don't Like:\\n- Ramen: (see above)\\n- Serving size: For the price you pay, I definitely expected more food. If you're someone who likes small portions, this place is definitely for you. The quality of the broth and ramen are of the highest; however, priced at ~ $14 a bowl, you can get a bigger bowl + extra ramen (essentially another bowl) for the same price at Pikaichi. \\n- Wait Time: Depending on what time you go, this place can get VERY crowded. The service is nice and quick but given the size, there isn't much space for big parties to sit. \\n\\nOverall: Great place to eat for lunch or dinner.

The Red Chuck cherry mojito was pleasant, but a bit too sweet. I got the bison burger, which despite being cooked perfectly at medium, it still tasted bland and dry.

I tasted the Americana burger, which also was pretty bland and the beef patty was small. The truffle fries and the maple bacon mac were pretty tasty though. Not sure if I'd come back.

The only gripe I have with two is that it can get really crowded and loud as well as expensive."},{"name":"Merrill & Co.","address":"1 Appleton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm very disappointed by this place, and as i surmised from the pre-opening publicity, it's really confused. The owners really haven't figured out what they want to be. Is it a diner? Is it comfort food? Is it high end? It doesn't really succeed at any of those goals now.\\n\\nThe only thing i like is the interior, which is a much better use of the space than 28 Degrees before it. Fun and casual. But the space is insanely loud since all the surfaces are hard. They need acoustical panels on the ceilings and to turn the music down. I couldn't hear anything and that made it much less enjoyable than it should be.\\n\\nNow the food.  First off, it's overpriced in light of the decor, which says \\"casual neighborhood place\\" (head over the Estelle's across the south end to see how this is done right.)  The drinks, apps, and main dishes are all overpriced, especially for the quality. I have a big issue for paying money to eat food I could easily make at home as well if not better, and most of what i tasted fell into that catagory.\\n\\nThe prices aren't outrageous, but the quality is not there so the quality has to rise to meet the prices, or the prices have to be lowered to meet the quality of the food, which is currently just not that great.\\n\\nBetween all of our various dishes i tasted the following:\\n\\nPork rinds: hard and not very porky.\\n\\nMac & Cheese: oddly sweet, and in need of something crunchy on top (in addition to needing a minute under the salamander for browning.)\\n\\nFarmer's Salad: I didn't taste it, but two of my companions said it was awful, and was sent back hardly touched (no one asked why, which they should have).\\n\\nDeviled Eggs:  Nothing special at all. Boil eggs. Mix yolks with mayo and mustard. Sprinkle on paprika. I can do this at home. If you are going to do it at a restaurant, it has to be BETTER than that.\\n\\nPork Belly:  Nothing special at all, especially for the $24 price point and entree size (\\"small\\").\\n\\nBurger: Two of us had it and both found it mushy, indistinct, tasteless and again, nothing special. The bacon-onion jam didn't stand out at all.  The parmesan waffle fries were too salty and had too much Parmesan to taste the potato.\\n\\nI had the D.Tea.O for a drink. It was in line with Boston's overpriced drink prices, it was unpleasant and underwhelming.  The drink list in general veers towards non-mainstream liqueurs no one really drinks. it was hard to find one i even wanted.\\n\\nAlso as others have mentioned, food comes out as it's done, which is only reasonable in a tapas place.  There's no reason to do that with this kind of mainstream food, and just results in some people having all their food, and some having nothing.  MOST restaurants have someone managing how the food comes out. \\n\\nMy takeaway is this place is pretty much a disaster food-wise. Overpriced and not at all special. While the space is nice, it's much much too loud. Overall this was hugely disappointing.\\n\\nWithout a top-to-bottom rethink of the menu and pricing and addressing the ridiculous noise problem, this place will fail. there's not way i'm coming back unless that happens.  There are too many restaurants nearby (Coda, Estelle's) doing the same class of food much better for this to stand out."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"As a person that was born in NY and spent my high school years an hour north of NYC, I claim to know good pizza and bagels.

Home slice is my family's go-to pizza joint. \\n\\nI remember hearing at one point that they take trips to NYC and tour pizza restaurants to figure out how to make their pizza better. I recall thinking they don't have it quite right with the margarita pizza because they didn't have that beautiful white cheese that Lombardi's has in NYC. Then, all the sudden they had the white cheese. I want to think it was due to visiting Lombardi's (my absolute favorite place in the US), I love that they used to do these trips to NYC but  but not sure if they still do this. \\n\\nWe get the same order every time: Margarita Pizza and the house salad. The salad comes with glorious garlic knots that we usually snack on during our ride home from picking up the pizza.

If you don't like capers, this might not be for you as you can definitely taste it.\\n- smoked Salmon with herb cream cheese - simple and yet so satisfying and delish!\\n- prosciutto with mozzarella, pesto and sun dried tomatoes - hands down this is EVERYONE's favorite.

We got there quite late - around 9.20, and they close at 10, so I almost expected that they wouldn't be able to serve us, but they greeted us, got us a table, and then left us to our own devices except to take the plates away.\\n\\nThe spread at the buffet itself was pretty huge, with multiple vegetarian and meat dishes. However, not all of them were equally delicious. Among the vegetarian ones, the dal, Aloo Gobi and Egg curry were really good! I had two helpings of each, though the egg curry was a tad too spicy for my taste. There were 2 paneer dishes and both were pretty lackluster. Among the meat dishes, the butter chicken was the best, followed by the beef keema. The chicken curry didn't have any flavor and the tandoori chicken tasted like what you might expect it to taste at the end of a day, sitting under hot lights (ie., chewy and tasteless). It was a pity, but we stuck to the good things.\\n\\nTheir naan was good, though naan is best served fresh out of the oven, and they had a pretty big variety of salads, dips, chutneys and dessert. I chose to skip dessert (though my friend liked their gulab jamun), but had a lot of raita to help with the spicy food - I really like well made raita :)\\n\\nWe knew they were getting close to their closing time when they started vacuuming around us, so we finished up and left. I didn't like that they automatically included tip in the bill, especially since it's a buffet and we didn't get much service from them. But over all I think it's worth visiting again (with the Groupon of course!) if you want good amounts of food, and you know which of the dishes to get. It's also possible that the food quality is better if you come earlier in the evening. Maybe I'll do that and find out for myself :)"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It was great food and environment  .

The tomato wasn't even diced up! I've never seen that before.  It was just a big slice of cold tomato throw in there. And the cheese wasn't even fully melted.  So when you'd bite into it you'd get a mix of warm egg and cold veggies and cheese, and then eventually the veggies just made the entire thing cold.

First off, I'm on a gluten free diet, and usually when you ask for the GF menu, it's this little thing with few options that are a shadow of what the regular menu is.  Not at Andina!  The GF menu is just a big and I felt like there was plenty to choose from.  They even have a bread basket alternative in the form of yucca fries with three dipping sauces.  So delicious. I could eat those all day.  I do miss bread most of the time, but this option makes you feel like your are coming out on top!\\n\\nThe cocktails are pretty tasty. We had the mojito and horchata de cafe.  No overly strong and tasty.  Our server was so helpful in walking us through the menu and even suggested that we split two entrees between the two of us, so it ended up being like a four-course tasting menu with the appetizer and dessert.  We had a dozen oysters to start.  They were so fresh and had a mild salty flavor. We ended up choosing the Arroz con Pato (Duck 2 ways- crispy confit leg and pan seared breast) and Corderito de los Andes (Rack of Lamb).  The duck confit was falling off the bone and the seared breast was crispy, and both had rich flavor, so I'm glad we split it.  The rack of lamb was my absolute favorite and was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I was going to go with the creme brulee for dessert, but our server gave me the \\"that's so boring look\\" and I asked her for advice.  She suggested the Mousse de Valle Y Selva- a chocolate mousse with cocoa nibs.  I'm glad she suggested it and I'm happy that in the short time we were there that we formed a rapport enough to tell me \\"eh that's a safe option\\" Because in reality the whole dining experience was new to us.  \\n\\nAndina is a great pick for a sure thing when it comes to a festive atmosphere (they have live music), a knowledgeable wait staff and some pretty kick ass food.

We stayed at St Elizabeths Hospital right across the street for 62 days. My wife ordered the steak tips with extra-extra steak tips to the tune of about $30. Price was worth the taste of the steak tips. We probably ordered over $400 worth of food since my wife was in the hospital. Having to meet them way at the bottom of the elevator was a bummer. \\n\\nOne particular time we called, the person on the phone was breathing and sighing heavily and angrily hung up on us because he couldn't get our credit card number right. He said he was flooded with customers, and hung up on us in frustration. I called back and asked to speak to a manager and the gentlemen said HE was the owner/manager. My wife had cravings for this food, so I went downstairs and walked way around to the restaurant and placed my order in person. Only one customer was there eating a pizza.\\n\\nAfter ordering, I gave them the same card that the manager said was declined. It went through. I felt so guilty paying for the food because of the crappy service. But my wife loves the steak tips. I'm hoping when we have to come back to have our baby, her steak tips cravings will be gone. This is possibly the worst attitude that any business owner could possibly have. I plan to talk about the service of this and other fast food spots on our radio show this Wednesday.\\n\\nAgain, the food is great. The service and consideration for the women at the hospital is ridiculously out of line. Had I not been at the hospital, my wife would never be able to go downstairs to pick up her orders.

There have been a few menu changes in recent years I don't care for, but favorites like their steaks remain. I think the first time I had a serious, well prepared steak was at Hall Street. I still remember, it looked completely different than I'd expected, and tasted great.\\n\\nWhen I first discovered their happy hour, I thought it was great. Even though they removed Roy's burger at some point, a simple but well prepared burger, there were many other good options. When I asked about it, they said \\"Yeah we still have it.\\" So I ordered it, but it cost $7 instead of $3. Ouch. It was good for $7 so I kept ordering them; my only gripes were the 133% price increase, and it was a \\"Kobe Burger\\" which seems like nonsensical use of Kobe beef.\\nGradually things changed. Other prices went up significantly, and the Kobe burger lost the Kobe for Angus but stayed the same price.\\nThe first time I ordered a mojito it was horribly made. Couldn't taste anything but lime juice. Months later somebody sitting near me said theirs was wonderful, so I ordered one again and it was. Continued ordering them on subsequent visits, but it was hit and miss. I think some of their bartenders know what they're doing, others are new or too rushed.\\nInterestingly, I've never had bad service on a Sunday but every other day has been mediocre at best - even though they seem empty in comparison to a Sunday.\\n\\nOne thing I frequently ordered was the chicken salad sandwich, and it eventually crept up to $7 also. Always good so I kept ordering it.\\nI checked the menu at hallstreetgrill.com at 3:15 today, and the sandwich was back to 4.95, and the burger was back to \\"Snake River Farms Kobe Burger 6.5\\" - I quote because I copied that just now. So I went over right after they opened up, ordered a caesar, and a chicken salad sandwich. The service was great, as was the food. The bill came and it was completely different. I asked why the Web site's menu was different, and was told to hang on so the manager could check. The manager came over with a printout which said it was from hallstreetgrill.com, and it matched their lounge menus. Though I did not ask or infer it, he told me he didn't just make a change to it. He also said maybe I read some posting somewhere and the poster was incorrect. I asked if he meant the Webmaster, and if I had read the correct site and he said I had, but didn't redact his argument that I was basing my question on some post on the Internet. He said if they matched the lower prices, they'd lose money. Unfortunately, talking down to customers shatters their respect. Like I said about the quotes - It's now been about 7 hours since I left, and the menu on their site is still different from the printed menu.

The cleaning habits of the kitchen, well no one works to get their kitchens as clean as this one. And the wonderful flavors of everything that we ate.

Luge Kitchen is the only place I've been during my 2 weeks in NE Colorado that I haven't loved. I ordered iced tea, and it tasted a little funky like the urns hadn't been cleaned well. When I took it up to the staff and asked for something else to drink, they charged me for the new drink. Not wanting to be a B over $2, I paid it. The kids meal for my 4-year-old and fish tacos for myself weren't quite enough food for us (they were relatively tasty, albeit small, and we'd had a long day and hadn't had much to eat), so I went back up to order a flatbread. I specifically asked if there was any dairy other than the goat cheese and was told no. After 20 minutes the order came out. There were maybe 2 other people in the restaurant, so the wait time on an app was really ridiculous. The \\"bread\\" part was very thin like a cracker and pretty brown - over cooked in my opinion. I ate a piece thinking,\\"yay! Goat cheese that's not ch√®vre!\\" THANKFULLY it struck me that I should double check that it's really goat cheese. I was told that it was not goat cheese, but regular mozzarella and something about the menu changing so the kitchen gets confused. Not cool. Really not cool. I said my baby (who is nursing) is allergic to cow dairy, so I can't eat it and she's going to be sick now. She offered to make a new one, but I said I didn't have time to wait 20 more minutes for another one. She shrugged and asked what she could do then. At a loss, I waited for my son to finish and we left. No one came to apologize or offer to comp the meal or put a rush refire in. Literally nothing. I left hungry, and my poor baby girl has been up all night crying because her stomach hurts (we're traveling, so I have nothing else to feed her...). I know this isn't an issue for most folks, but don't expect great service or prompt food or even to get exactly what you order (because, you know, the menu changes and the kitchen staff can't keep up ).

If you've always loved pizza but desire a more refined atmosphere, you're in luck.\\n\\nI tend to like my comfort food in comfortable environs so I was a little put off by the fancy factor when I walked in.  This quickly subsided once the food started coming out.  Everything from the simple arugula salad to the pizza itself was expertly prepared and really just delicious.  \\n\\nWe had two pizzas, one with red sauce and one without, to test it out and they were both excellent.  Siting at the \\"pizza bar\\" you can see just how fresh everything is and how carefully they ensure that each pizza is cooked perfectly in the wood oven (which I guess was shipped from Italy, for what that's worth).\\n\\nThere are some drawbacks to the fancy factor, like a fairly limited drink menu that includes italian sodas and Mexican Coke (Mexico?).  Seating is also pretty limited due to a questionable layout of the space so you may find yourself eating a somewhat short uncomfortable stool if you take the first available.\\n\\nLastly, you get a tremendous value for the money.  Most of the pizzas are around $15, which strikes me as very inexpensive for the quality of what you get.  They don't gouge you on the drinks either.  Completely reasonable all around and, after you first walk in, that will probably come as a pleasant surprise."},{"name":"Adelitas","address":"5178 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Not really good for those who are vegetarians.

It is very open with tall ceilings, very industrial looking. There was also a live band, which I thought was pretty awesome for a Wednesday night. It is really well-decorated. It definitely has a romantic vibe (low lighting). Our reservation was at 7, and it was about half full when we arrived. By 7:30, it was almost full! So, I would definitely recommend making a reservation before coming (I used Open Table). \\n\\nFood: I ordered the Empanada as an appetizer. It was AMAZING. I would definitely recommend that. The meat inside was very juicy and well flavored. They also bring you some bread with ricotta cheese. For my main course I ordered the Bar Steak (steak over mashed potatoes with chimichurri sauce on top, mushrooms and green beans on the side). I also really enjoyed this. However, next time I would maybe ask for the chimichurri on the side. It was delicious, but also kind of oily.

The pros being that there are plenty of cheap eats available for a quick bite and many attractive young girls that are trying to carve out some sort of future for themselves.  The cons are that although plenty of choices may be available, they are often the typical flavorless bland fast food junk that one finds at the intersection of 1st and Main at suburban America.\\n\\nLuckily, at times a small gem appears which stands a bit out of the normal distribution and becomes a taste bud outlier.  However, this could be an outlier to the left or to the right of the mean.  Falafel Cafe happens to fall into this category and it leans just one standard deviation to the right.\\n\\nIt's quite a modest establishment, rather small, but it does the trick for the power lunches of those employed by the large multinationals in the research parkway area like yours truly.  The interior does give the vibe of a Lebanese street cafe / bazaar with a dark woody decoration with ceiling fans and Dabke music being played as background noise.  It can get a bit warm inside during summer days, which to me was not the best experience.  Eating in the heat just is a detriment to the whole experience.\\n\\nThe service was quick and prompt.  The server which I suspect is also the owner running the 'few' men operation was very nice and took our orders in haste.  The food came out very quickly and my Gyro (see my photo) was just right.

If you're a place that makes a point to have an extensive collection of beers and special mixed drinks then you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing a nice beer to be served in such a manner.

The word piccante must've meant STRONG in this instance because it did not mean spicy. ZERO orange taste. Hugely disappointing. \\n\\nThe Notorious P.I.G. was also disappointing. I think they ran out of buns because I was given two pretzel buns despite never asking for them and they were both dry and slightly cold. The Mac N Cheese was of the same quality you get from Fur's cafeteria. I hate that I know what that's like, as much as I hate that what I was given. The sausage itself was nice, the BBQ sauce was just BBQ sauce.\\n\\nTwo sausages on buns with average ingredients written up to be something fancy and a beer for $26.

The \\"homemade\\" lemonade didn't really taste like lemonade, it was more like sugar water with a hint of lemon. I didn't mind it too much, but it wasn't good lemonade though. Meatloaf was good, but I've definitely had better. It came out warmish, not like it was just made but kinda like it was microwaved or was left sitting under a warmer. Vegetable soup was okay, loaded with an assortment of veggies, but eh wasn't impressed. Fries sucked, didn't have any expectations for them when I saw them on my plate. I mean, all in all, it was an okay experience. The place itself is really nice and clean, loved the vibes, but the food just wasn't up to par. If I was a local and my friends were like, \\"Hey you wanna stop by Mary Mac's?\\" I'd go, just cause it's there and convenient, but if you tell me I should visit this place after a 6.5 hour drive, I'll pass.

Other than the fact that my friends and I are of Asian descent, I really don't know why this happened. When we finally got a spot and went in, the hostess told the group in front of me the wait was 40 min but when she got to me she didn't even look at the screen and automatically told me an hour and a half with a nasty attitude.

This is an excellent place to take in the view and a good value compared to the observatory deck in the Prudential tower - for the price of admission to the observatory, you can get the same view at Top of the Hub (well, most of the same view anyway - I think the view westwards is largely blocked b y the kitchen) plus a couple of drinks. Not bad!\\n\\nBut for locals, the view itself isn't going to cut it. A high end place like this should be reliable and accommodating - whether for a night at the bar of for a table of 12. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. I've waited half an hour for a drink at the bar at night, been turned away with a party of friends when we thought we had reservations only to find out we'd been given an unreasonable table minimum, had servers who were unable to explain items on the menu in any helpful way, received the wrong check, and on and on. Don't get me wrong - I've had great meals and drinks here and also received some excellent service. But the unpredictability means I can't take clients here for dinner or drinks, wouldn't take friends here on a whim to the bar or the dining room, and couldn't take anything they tell me over the phone at face value.

Maluken is a pretty nondescript Japanese place with seemingly mediocre food for the price.  We got a little sushi (3 orders of nigiri) and then sukiyakis.  The sushi was middling-quality - they were out of shiso, the fluke was too chewy, and both the salmon and the albacore tuna tasted too strongly fishy.  I don't know if this was because of the particular day, but it wasn't so good.  Salads were a little dull with mostly iceberg lettuce and a few shredded carrots, with too much dressing.  The sukiyaki wasn't cooked at the table, but instead in the kitchen, and in addition to being not really flavorful enough, the beef wasn't all that great and was in pieces that were much too large.  On the bright side, the miso soup was excellent. :)\\n\\nAmbiance isn't very exciting, and the constant karaoke videos on the big projection screen were a bit distracting too.

Fantastically simple and it shows. It is the best lobster roll in the city. The shoestring fries are the PERFECT side. \\n\\nThe salads here are excellent as well.  The little gem salad, with anchovy dressing, parmesan, and croutons had the people at the next people drooling. \\n\\nWhen I went for dinner, we had the garlicky tiny clams & pork belly with hand-torn croutons and chili, a dish so fantastically tasty and spicy, that the only thing comparable and the only thing that bests it is the angry mussels at Fry's other restaurant JCT.Kitchen. The Pacific wild cod with corn, corn puree, and shishito peppers is another example of beauty in simplicity. A wonderful dish. \\n\\nMost seafood places start to fall flat come dessert time.

I went to another restaurant in Winter Park last year for Magical Dining with pretty much the same group of people.  I don't remember this being the rule.  Our server didn't give us any explanation but did allow one of our group to make vegetarian substitutions for the appetizer and entree.  I spoke with him after and he said the vegetarian \\"entree\\" was basically a plate of frozen vegetables sauteed in butter, and that's definitely what it looked like to me when he was served.  One of my friends found out that her friend and family were dining at Hamilton's Kitchen at the same time as us.  We went over to say \\"Hi\\" and mentioned the Magical Dining rule.  Her friend's server happened to overhear us and seemed confused.  She said she was unaware of that rule and told the table they could order off either menu, or both.  Inconsistencies like these without any explanation are annoying and unprofessional.

We're so over restaurants with music blasting in your ears, especially prevelant in the downtown Orlando restaurants. Only thing we will add is that this is not a once a week, drop-in-for-a-bite kind of place for us. The pricing is a tad stiff, worth it, but with 2 entrees, 1 iced tea, and a glass of water coming in at $53 with tax and tip, this will be more of an occassional treat for us.

I suppose we were \\"people\\" too, however.\\n\\nAll told, a two hour wait saw us seated in the trendy interior of dark wood and stainless appliances.

Like many places I sample, I wish it had bigger servings but for the price they charge it'd be impractical.  It's brunch and not a fullon feast after all.  Their sandwiches aren't bad either, although a little small.  I'd say this is a good place for the morning after, but not every old weekend morning.

Boy was I surprised to run into hordes of tourists in shorts, t-shirts and flip flops lining the hallway to get in.  I was in the city one day and decided to have a late lunch.  I started with the strawberry lemonade with basil mock tail.  It was my first mock tail and it was fabulous.  I'd never considered putting basil into a drink before but it went so well, I might have to try it at home!  I started with the Lobster Bisque and I must say that it's one of the best bisques I've had in New England.  It's titled as \\"Spicy Lobster Soup\\" but it seems like a bisque to me.  There's really no spiciness to it but the coconut milk, lemongrass and ginger give it nice depth and uniqueness.  I cleaned the bowl with the bread provided.  At the end of my soup, I was asked if there would be anything else I wanted.  I informed the server that I'd ordered an entree.  She fumbled around for a bit and then walked off, met up with my server and they disappeared.  After about a 20 minute wait (after having my soup), my meal arrived.  They clearly forgot to put in the entree order which is really inexcusable.  There was no apology or offer of something to make it up.  I just sat for 20 minutes.  Thankfully I was parked at a window so I had the beautiful day to keep me occupied.  When my George's Banks Haddock Rockefeller arrived, it was a massive slab of fish.  With the coating of cheeses, spinach and bread crumbs, the fish was super moist and very, very good.  I was once again content to be eating something that was quite good.

Standing in a long line at Voodoo Donuts with the Gospel Mission sign just up the block in clear sight, I wondered what dad would say.  I say Voodoo's owners get a bonus star for the chutzpah of opening an original concept donut shop here.\\n\\nLOCATION:  The hard luck story people who call Portland's streets home are a big presence in this part of town.  I could tell some of the folks standing in line with us who were out of town tourists who had read about Voodoo in a food magazine or seen it on a TV show and were surprised by the neighborhood.  So heads up to tourists to note the location.\\n\\nPARKING:  Tough to find on city streets so walking from your hotel is ideal or hop on Portland's outstanding public transit.   (We strolled over to Voodoo from the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse and it was a 6/10 of a mile, 15 minute-ish walk with traffic signal stops included.) \\n\\nTHE DRILL:  Stand in line, order at the counter and you can take the donuts to go or, weather permitting, eat them at the picnic tables outside.  No inside seating.  Worth saying that you are expected to know what you want to order when you get to the counter.  There is a chalkboard above with donut names listed and a rotating case of donuts on display but this is not the time to ask \\"can you tell me what's in the...\\".   There are smartphone bar codes posted on the window and signs that direct you to review the menu in advance.  (Or you can check it out on line at this link: http://voodoodoughnut.com/doughnuts.php )\\n\\nSERVICE:  Service is friendly enough and more patient than Seinfeld's infamous \\"The Soup Nazi\\" but I got the impression they might say \\"No Donuts for YOU\\" if someone were to dawdle too long with their order and hold up the line.  A line which moves surprisingly briskly thanks to the counter staff's efficiency.  \\n\\nSHORTER LINES & LONG LINES:  Lines will be longer at some times.  Thanks to people who filled us in based on their repeated experience, we learned the best time to go for shortest lines was around 11am when the morning rush was over and before the afternoon and evening crowds are just starting to trickle in.  They said we could find maybe only 30 people in line if we went that early.  Sure enough, arriving about 11:30 we found only 40 people in front of us and only a 15 minute-ish wait.  We hear waits can be up to an hour.  These were good enough donuts, but waiting for an hour even on a lovely day, let alone the rain would be a no go for me.\\n\\nDONUTS:  I'm not a donut aficionado and on the rare occasion I eat one I lean to cake donuts with minimal adornment.   I loved the Mexican Hot Chocolate donut, a chocolate cake donut dusted with cinnamon sugar and cayenne.  My hubby went for a traditional Romeo Raspberry jelly filled raised donut and enjoyed it too.  At $2.65 for the two donuts, this was a bargain lunch.  Heads up for my Vegan friends, there are Vegan options available. \\n\\nTHIS N THAT:\\n\\n1) HOURS:  Twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.\\n\\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Level in  through the door and inside.\\n\\n3) OTHER LOCATIONS:  We were surprised to learn there is now a Voodoo in NE PDX as well as one in Eugene.  But this original site is definitely worth a visit.\\n\\n4) SHIPPING:  No, they don't.  Good fresh donuts have too short a shelf life for that.  So you'll need to go in to try them. \\n\\n5) OTHER DONUTS:  The concierge at our hotel told us Blue Star downtown has better donuts and shorter lines.

A lot of breweries specialize in beers like barrel aged or sours. Then there are some that just make a little bit of everything to satisfy everyone's tastes. When we walked in we got a flight to sample everything they had. My boyfriend liked the majority of their beers, but I wasn't a huge fan of much. I liked the Cherry Lila the most because there was a cherry flavor without tasting like cough syrup. \\n\\nThey also have food to order so we ordered the bread and butter to share. They had other things but we had been eating all day and just needed something to soak up all the booze from the day.\\n\\nI think the only thing that messed up my experience here was the service. I wasn't expecting someone to walk me through each beer's tasting notes and give me a tour of the place. A friendly, \\"hello\\" would have been nice.

There really isn't a whole lot of food but it's served on a long rectangular plate to make it seem like there's more than there actually is.  The tortilla soup had a strange sour taste to it.  Other than that, it was ok.  The only real differences between the Asian salad here and the sesame salads at Panera are that you can throw different meats on the salads here and they throw nuts in your salad here.  Basically, when you come here, expect to spend around 10 bucks for a meal and a drink.\\n\\nWhen you arrive, you order at the counter, grab a number, and put it at your table.

The place is very much \\"Austin-y.\\" A small bistro that seemed to be jammed between two buildings (one being a large red building that completely overshadows the place) with modest seating space both inside and outside. Tables, that are cramped together and a busy looking cafe counter with fresh pastries on display. We were seated at one of the two long tables that stretched down the length of the bistro. But anyways, on to service.\\n\\nService was pretty good overall. We came around 11 am and were seated right away as there were not many people there yet. However, that changed quickly, within about 15-20 minutes, and the place was full. There were two long waits. First, for the waitress to take our orders (though it may be because she thought we needed more time with the menu). Second, for our food, which came out around 20-25 minutes. Other than this, service was great. They were attentive and friendly.\\n\\nI ordered the Smoked Salmon Tartine w/ herb cream cheese, which came with a slice of watermelon, salad, and cucumber. The tartine was delicious and the plating was very pleasing to the eye. Though the salmon did not taste very smokey the texture and saltiness was good and worked well with the herb cream cheese and fresh cucumber. The bread wasn't crusty or crunchy, but was a great vehicle for the salmon. Everything tasted very clean and fresh.\\n\\nI swapped food with some friends and tried the crepe w/ sweet ricotta and prosciutto tartine. The prosciutto tartine was good, and the crepe was okay, but I don't think I can eat that much ricotta. From what my friends told me the frittata was good and the waffles were simply okay and not very special.\\n\\nI definitely would recommend coming here.

The complimentary starter is a basket of quinoa studded bread with a trio of salsas: a peanut salsa, a passion fruit salsa, and a jalape√±o, mint, cilantro salsa (from mild to hot).

While I can't vouch for the level of authenticity of the dishes we ordered, I can say that it was not ordinary american Chinese fare and they were all delicious and fresh. It was also a good sign that my boyfriend's Chinese coworkers recommended this place as well as the table of 10 Chinese men drinking and cheering at the table next to us.

First off the ambiance is very clean and crisp. It felt very modern. Because I don't get down to this side of town often I decided to try a few items. The first thing I tried was the Banana cacao avocado acai bowl. It was really good, in fact it was so good I make them for breakfast everyday now.There was a lot of textures as well which made it interesting to eat but in the best way.  I also tried the curried almond Brussels sprouts. I am a big lover of Brussels sprouts so this caught my eye. It was savory and sweet and very flavorful.  Lastly I had to try a juice.  I tried the easy beet and was very happy with my decision. My best friend who hates most vegetables really enjoyed my juice. I wish this was closer to where I live but I will be back and often.

I think they give you a large amount of food. I love when I have enough for leftovers later. The food is seasoned fairly well and they have lot of menu options. They have reasonable prices. \\n\\nI want to give it 4 stars, but there are just some things that they need to address to improve the customer experience overall. \\n\\n- They have truly outgrown the space. In the waiting area there is really only room for maybe two families of 4 to sit and the rest is standing room only which unfortunately is right in front of the check-in area. On a weekend this gets really congested.\\n- Due to the lack of space this creates chaos in the waiting room which causes the employees to become frustrated, which in turn makes the hungry patrons disgruntled. Everyone is now mad by the time they sit down for a meal. \\n- Due to the small location there is also no parking spaces in the tiny parking lot. You typically have to park blocks down the road in the neighborhood and walk. At least it is a nice neighborhood so a leisure stroll may be nice, but it would be nicer if you didn't have to park so far. \\n- There are two times I've been with large group (12 - 15 people) and both times the check was incorrect. I know that serving a big group can be daunting, but it seems to be a pattern as I've heard this from others as well. \\n\\nThe fact that they are always so busy should tell you that the food is good which I give them that credit, but since they are doing so well I think it is time for them to up their Customer Service game in the areas I mentioned above."},{"name":"Jitlada","address":"1459 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Clean and modern looking restaurant, very friendly service, and delicious food.

The pad thai was good but I would sooner try something else next time.\\n\\nI ordered the Thai iced tea because another reviewer recommended it.

I wouldn't get that drink again.\\n\\nI was surprised that we were the only dinner guests from 6:30-8:00pm on a Tuesday night, but I guess it's a bit of a random neighbourhood, being near Granville & Broadway (busy for people on transit) but tucked in between Memphis Blues and Vera's.  It's easy to miss Jitlada when you're walking down the street.

I had a ribs craving last week so my husband and I found ourselves at this establishment.  We started off with a cheesy fries and bacon appetizer, which was tasty and hit the spot.  The ribs, however, left little to be desired.  We got the Memphis style ribs, and they were dry, tough and chewy.  They had a bit of a burned taste as well, with an almost charcoal-like aftertaste that was quite off-putting.  I am no ribs aficionado, but since I am from the South, I've had my fair share of ribs, so I think I can be level headed in my review of these things.  They say the tell-tale sign of good ribs is if they fall off the bone.  These ribs were a challenge to eat due to their toughness, and had a really bad taste.  I think I could have been satisfied had they at least tasted good, notwithstanding the chewyness.  We also got the sweet potato fries, which were a bust.  They were drenched in oil and were not crispy at all.  I could understand the ribs not being cooked properly, as they are difficult to master for some places, but fries should be a no-brainer.

Always enjoyed the service here.  If it weren't for the good service, I'd definitely give this place only one star.  The problem is the prices and quality of food.  Having been to New Orleans many times for work, this is a very poor approximation.  First thing I noticed was nearly everything was fried.  The baskets are fried food, served with a side of fries, for a relatively exorbitant amount for the quality of food you receive.  I've also had their jumbalaya and their ettouffe, neither of which I was a fan of.

I was expecting a quinoa bowl but this arrived as a large plate with a few pieces of veggies.

It's quite scant--four tables--so the pizza is mostly for take-out.  I was excited.

The pizza arrived about 20 minutes later, and we excitedly digged in.\\n\\nThere was too much cheese on the pizza.  Granted, it was good cheese--there was some kind of creamy, milky taste that I have not tasted in any other pizza--but the ratio was not at all even.  That I could forgive, as I artistically removed some cheese to achieve the correct ratio.  Then, the tip of each slice was quite soggy, perhaps too soggy, and we both agreed that was the case.  But digging further into the slice, the crust was a perfect, crispy, somewhat charred thin crust.  \\n\\nAs far as toppings, the spinach seemed to be sauteed beforehand, which added to the flavor of the pizza, and the tomatoes were fresh.  But I was sorely disappointed at the quality of the pepperoni--it tasted not much different than the ones I buy at the supermarket.\\n\\nBut that is just me being extra critical--try to find ways for the pizza to become an A+ instead of an A with a tiny minus sign at its end.  Really, the pizza was absolutely amazing--one of my top three pizza places in my life.  Delicious delicious delicious, and no bloated after-feeling despite having a few large slices.  And apparently, it is made with a lot of love, as that is something in food you do not get in commercialized, over-touristy New York pizzerias aka Grimaldis.

I don't recommend the Bruschetta, as the anchovy is not mixed in with the chickpea puree, leading to less overall balance as some bites are too fishy and salty and some not enough.  The Vesuvius is about the easiest thing to make and was not a disappointment.  It was not anything special, though, so make it at home and save yourself $6.  The best appetizer was the meatball plate.  Simply delicious!\\n\\nI have to say that the pizza was good, not great. Our pizza choices were the Funghi and the Maiale.  I'm sorry, but neither one of these pizzas were anything that great.  The Funghi was topped with roasted white mushrooms.  You know, the white Button mushrooms that you see at the grocery store?  Same thing.  If you want to be this stuck up about everything, why not use chanterelles, oysters, or creminis?  Sad.  The Maiale was interesting and certainly a well-balanced pizza, but nothing amazing.  I saw the prosciutto leg being carved, so I was very excited to get the pizza.  It lacked a certain something... the Umami sense of taste, I believe is the missing element.  If you like fish, you will probably like this pizza.  That is the way it makes me feel.  \\n\\nOverall, I was disappointed, but would try it again."},{"name":"The Righteous Room","address":"2142 Johnson Ferry Rd","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"This is the kind of laid back atmosphere that I like.

Also our \\"bottomless\\" drinks were never refilled and the waitstaff said there was no way to remove the charge. Beer and Champagne was warm, timing of food was off and the presentation was worse. All requests for items were completely ignored, eggs were runny, ordered rare burgers were charbroiled beyond recognition and everyones fries were cold. The Farmer's Breakfast was the oddest plate of eggs cooked whichever way the kitchen felt versus what was ordered, oily croutons for toast and a mushy accouterment of asparagus. The only standout was the sausage which was perfectly cooked but it was the only edible thing on the plate. Flavor combinations for mimosas were limited and chosen at random by waitstaff. I was given multiple unwanted guava ones which were mostly puree and seeds. The best part of the entire fiasco was asking for ketchup. It was brought over piled in a salt pig or trough of sorts.

Also, they fortunately have a pretty decent happy hour, with discounted appetizers as well as drinks, and it's just as filling and as satisfying to order several small plates to share instead of two entrees.

It honestly felt like I was hanging out with my friends. Not stuffy at all. \\n\\nThe decor - great ambiance, dim lighting, gorgeous lanterns and lights, overall the feeling was casual but cool.

Also, the music selection was basically my entire Spotify playlist so, that was 3 points off the bat. \\n\\nThe food - every dish came out piping hot. I hate to say it but a lot of restaurants I've been to here served my food lukewarm. Maybe I'm cursed, I don't know. But I was happy to eat a hot, fresh meal. We ordered the lobster rice, crispy beef, and fried chicken with lobster mac & cheese and to drink the house made blackberry sweet tea. DAMN. they were all delicious!!! The lobster Mac \\nAnd cheese was good, not the best I've had but it was good. The fried chicken atop was crispy and juicy, just as you'd expect. Asparagus, crispy kale, and broccolini on the side. Overall it was a tasty dish but my least favorite out of the three. Their crispy beef is reallllllly good. The sauce they use is delicious and their rice was sticky. Lots of yummy veggies mixed in. It was sweet but salty. Now, my favorite has to be the lobster fried rice. For $28 you get a fried lobster tail - holy shit it was soooo good!!! The flavor was awesome. The rice had so much flavor to it and a ton of ingredients. Highly recommend this. For dessert we had the green tea mousse cake - it was light mousse with flavorful chocolate cake and acidic strawberries - all homemade - don't miss it! \\n\\nOverall, the people here are warm, good service, and the food speaks for itself.
