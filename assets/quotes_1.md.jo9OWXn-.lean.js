More importantly the staff was knowledgeable and courteous . The waiter gave a great recommendation for the unfiltered sake (Nigori), & it wasn't the most expensive one, so I felt he was being honest. Not to mention it was good. Cool, refreshing & sweet with a subtle hint of fruit. The bottle was just enough for two. I was dinning with a friend, and we wanted to sample a little bit of everything, so we ordered the Yanagi boat. It came with three different cuts of sashimi (about 12 pc), two rolls (8 pc for each roll), 8 different types of sushi, along with a seaweed salad & miso soup for two. The boat was priced at $53. The bottle of sake was $13. We had plenty of food.  We could have split it with three people. We ended up taking some home (not a complaint!).

I've never been much of a golf fan besides mini golf but this place is grade A Fun. My review is based off two experiences but overall the fun of the sport is worth coming back for. Orlando has it all but a driving range is something we've needed. \\n\\nFor starters I love the decor and set up here. It's pretty huge with three floors. They have a full kitchen and a full bar on all floors. Top Golf is great for private events and birthdays as they have event rooms or you could gather a group for your own bay similar to a bowling alley lane. You can split the price between 1-6 friends per hour and make it low cost or pay the whole amount and hog the bay for yourself. I find the group play to be fun just like bowling. Different times are different cost. Open-noon $30, 12-5pm $40 And 5-close is $50. We decided to come at night time so my friends could drink but daytime is fun for brunch and mimosas. The wait can be a little long as this place is pretty popular but they have a seating area on the third floor with games and fire place lounge areas. \\n\\nService here was different on two different occasions but overall it is good. Our first experience was amazing. Our server explained everything to us as new comers and signed us up for their one time membership fee of $5 a person. Everything else is pretty self explanatory. You can just drive your balls or play games they offer on the screen. The second time we came our server we had wasn't as attentive and she seemed to get a little frazzled by the business. They closed the first floor leading to a longer wait which didn't make sense to me. We ordered food and they were helpful with my boyfriends allergies. I will mention we tried to call in advance for questions regarding the menu and NO ONE answered the phone for two days. They made up for this in person as the chef came out and offered him options and accommodated him well. All of our food was fairly fast and good (nothing extraordinary) I will say it's par to TGIF. The drinks are a bit overpriced but that is to be expected. Something important to mention is that if you plan to eat a full meal I'd do it before or after so you have more game play time. Small bites and drinks are easy to manage though. \\n\\nOverall I find Top Golf really fun and even if you don't play as much (like me) it's still fun to watch and the view is spectacular here. Love the Florida sunset with the Orlando Eye in view. Also the music is pretty fun and they light up the holes to match the music which is entertaining."},{"name":"Thai Basil","address":"1215 Thurlow St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"i wish there was a 0 stars option. terrible service that i wouldn't expect from the dingiest restaurant in chinatown.   i pondered a few options before i ordered some broccoli dish.  after waiting a while i went to check on my food at the counter.  the guy who took my order gave it to me.  i took it to my seat and started eating.  it was a really boring stir fry rice dish and not how i remembered the dish being described but thought they had just messed up the order.  the guy comes out and tells me i had taken the wrong food. i reminded him that he had given it to me. he was convinced that somehow my plot was devious although i was actually eating something that was not what i even wanted.  he took the food away and brought me my dish a few minutes later.  not much better but at least it had broccoli.  then another women from the kitchen feels it was appropriate to come from the kitchen and tell me how erroneous my actions had been.  i was apologetic the whole time but also reminded her that i was the customer and it was an honest mistake.  somehow it escalated with her telling me never to come back.  i took my dish in at the end of the meal, and calmly told them how offensive their service was. she told me to leave the premises. i told them i had the right to stand their and complain. she said she would call 911.  i laughed at her presumption.   i don't know where these people are from, but i never ever saw such obnoxious behaviour in my many wonderful travels to thailand. these people area disgrace to the service industry, in thailand and vancouver."},{"name":"Green Lettuce Indian Style Chinese Restaurant","address":"1949 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've been told that Green Lettuce's Idian/Chinese Food is Fantastically Anthentic!

Nice.\\n\\nWe also had a soup made with pork bones and vegetables. The broth itself was clean tasting, but bland. It may be because the other dishes were full if savoury flavours in contrast to this soup. The pork bones must have simmered for hours, the meat had come off the bones very easily. The vegetables were also a bit bland, but still good. I do not know what kind of a dried vegetable was used, it had a nice chew to it. Because the soup was a little tasteless, I drank the soup in between tastings of each dish as a palate cleanser before trying a different flavour from another dish. \\n\\nWe had also ordered some beef bulgolgi to try. The meat was a little too fatty, and the marinade was a bit too sweet for my own palate. But the cooking process itself was amazingly good.\\n\\nThe food here is not exceptionally excellent, but is better than many other Korean restaurants in the Richmond area. Yes, I did give this place 4 stars, but that is because our servers kept our little plates of ban chan filled. The staff is very polite and always kept our tea pot and water glasses full.\\n\\nI would return here again, but not eat here often."},{"name":"Pasquini's Pizzeria","address":"816 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"Inside this third installment of Pasquini's needs a little interior design direction.  It's obvious that they're going for funk and unique, but they haven't quite reached it.  Walls of purple, hardwood floors, and mosaic tile tables are still a welcomed changed from the typical decor you find at other restaurants.\\n\\nAs you walk in, your eye will find the counter displaying their sweet tooth goodies.  So much of it looks so good.  If you really want to indulge, order dessert for your appetizer since you will not have enough room in your belly after soothing your appetite with their entrees.\\n\\nThe marinara they use for their pizzas and calzones is bursting with flavor. Plenty of garlic and I'm sure a magnitude of other seasonings.  Garlic bread sticks covered in Parmesan were not drenched in garlic butter as some of the reviews for other locations had mentioned.  they were crunchy on the outside but still soft enough inside that you pulled a bit to break into smaller pieces.  My pepperoni calzone was enormous!  The bread was nicely browned and not doughy or taste of flours.  The mozzarella was gooey and the spice from the pepperoni stood out.  \\n\\nPasquini's menu has a lot to offer from calzones composed of wheat dough and artichokes to walnut pear salads.  The desserts are inventive and I will not forgo the chocolate candle at my next visit.  \\n\\nMy better half is 1/2 Italian and I know this place is our next stop.

For the appetizer, I highly reccomend the totchos. Its tater tots seasoned like nachos, and it's the best thing on the menu. Aside from the totchos, I tasted the fried zucchini which was gross because the frying process made it have no taste. The avocado bruschetta didn't taste bad but if you compared it to the totchos, they were far inferior. The best lobster mac and cheese I have had is here at the Chocolate Emporium. I split the totchos & mac and cheese with my sister - it was plenty of food between the two of us. Lastly, the milkshakes are pretty much a signature of this restaurant. I tasted both the cookie jar and the marshmellow, and cookie jar was by far my favorite.

Especially if certain people in your group annoy the hell out of you. I will explain why later. Walking in, we were greeted promptly by the hostess and a guy who looked like the manager. We had a party of seven and they told us it would take a moment, so we went outside to take pictures. When we went back inside, they seated us in a room that I like to call the wine room, because the walls were covered with shelves of wine. It was like being in a wine library. Great ambiance. Something weird that I noticed was that every hour or so someone would turn the lights down even lower. Even though it was dark outside...? Confused about that. The restaurant wasn't too crowded. Our waitress came by a couple of minutes after we were situated and promptly brought us our waters and a glass of house white for moi. She was pretty good about checking in on us and keeping our waters filled and our bread basket stocked. So one of the girls decided to leave because she started feeling sick (I don't think this was related to Vespaio) and the rest of us decided to split entrees. There were two orders of Cioppino, one order of the clam linguine, and an order of the halibut. The portions were not two big and not too small. My friend said the halibut was a little bland, but I enjoyed the subtle smoky flavor of the fish. The accompanying PEI mussels were tender and also a little smoky, reminiscent of a campfire on a crisp fall night. The halibut was nestled on top of a bed of mashed spuds along with some vegetables and broth (sauce?). Overall, delicious. Didn't get to try the other dishes but they also looked really tasty. \\nEverything was going pretty well until we were done eating. We waited for the check for what seemed like forever until we found out that someone had told our waitress it was my friend's birthday...so they brought out some ice cream with a candle in it. I thought that was what took our check so long, and we were expecting our check shortly after that but no. Another ten minutes went by before we got the check. Then came the headaching process of deciding how to split our astronomically large bill.

They need some cross training with literally any other Thundercloud to understand how to make egg salad. And I understand running out, but if a place keeps running out of an ingredient that other locations have, someone isn't ordering correctly. Maybe you think there's not enough demand for it by looking at sales, but you're not selling any because you're always out and it's stale when you do. Pretty sure the stuff freezes okay, so not sure what the issue is. The employees have been friendly here so this isn't a knock on their service, but I'm guessing it's not well managed. Either way, never going back.  I tried; you failed."},{"name":"Vespaio Ristorante","address":"1610 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went here recently for a date night after being turned away from a few other Italian restaurants we had planned to try. They were packed as well (this was a Wednesday night at 9pm-- who would have thought?) but had a few tables open so we were seated immediately.\\n\\nThe wait staff was super pleasant and attentive, and ordering was easy. Ambiance was definitely date-y -- low lights and a cozy feeling.\\n\\nWhen ordering I did notice, however, that they don't have a beer list. We spent a few very confused minutes looking through the multiple menus as we saw people getting beer and eventually asked our waiter who told us what they had available (2 local beers on tap, and a few domestic brews in bottles). I'd really like it if they could print a beer menu, even if it was a sheet of paper tucked in the wine menu. \\n\\nI also noticed there aren't a lot of non-seafood options-- but it is an Italian place after all, so no harm no foul, just noting it for people who might not like seafood. \\n\\nI ended up getting the Carbonara and my boyfriend got clams and linguine. We both loved our meals, thought they were well worth the price, and left full and happy.\\n\\nIf you're looking for well-done, authentic Italian food in the South Austin area, this place is it.

I had shrimp tacos. They were decent, but they were WAY over-sauced with a heavily cilantro-infused sauce. I'm a person who actually really likes cilantro, but this was too much. Eventually I ended up picking apart my tacos, taking out the insides, scraping most of the sauce off, and eating it piece by piece.\\n\\nThe worst thing about this place for me was that they pack way too many people into way too small of a space.

To your left is an open bar with tons of flat screen TV's and a lounge area.  The decor is modern and done tastefully.  to your right is the elevator, stairs and a club shop.  On the second floor (main) there is a Private Dinning Area complete with its own bar and partition to turn it into two separate rooms.  \\n\\nAll three floors offer something a little bit different, but mainly the same services.  The top floor (my favorite!) has an open air patio lounge with full bar, tons of TV's, plenty of comfy seating, fire pits, and a DJ stand.  I can easily see myself watching football out there, enjoying some cold ones, and hitting some golf balls.  There is also a foosball table near the top of the stairs.\\n\\nThe bottom floor, which is where I spent most of the night, opens up to a large bar and lounge to the left after coming down the stairs.  They have a shuffle board table as well.  Walking out towards the bays, you will see a private club area to the right complete with four private bays, tables, TV's and sliding glass doors that open up to a lounge that faces out from the entrance.  \\n\\nThis is where it gets crazy.  This TopGolf is the first in the world to have GPS chips in the ball that track your velocity, spin, distance, height, etc.  It's pretty amazing!  There are large displays at each bay to show you and your friends how good (or bad in my case) you are!  The bays all have the same amenities on each floor, some have high tops and others have couches.  \\n\\nThe food that was served was delish!  They had roast beef with horseradish, a wonderful green salad with house dressing (didn't have it), freshly breaded chicken tenders (they were my favorite), blackened shrimp over Gouda grits (ok I lied, that was my fav), and a host of other snacks.  I would go there just to eat the food, and its a bit of a drive from where I live, it was that good.  \\n\\nThere is so much more to type, but its all positive.

I'm on this page since I'm raving about this place to my wife tonight, thought I'd add something.\\n\\nI grew up eating pizza made by Italians. I'm from the East Coast. In a 5 minute drive in any direction from my home, was pizza made by Italians. Boston and NY was a weekend destinatinion for me. And in no way do I think pizza needs to be made by Italians or in a certain destination to be good. Some of the best pizza I've had was in Asia, but it was made by people who knew pizza.\\n\\nSo, on whim, looking at the sign that said, pizza by the slice, I thought I'd grab a slice. I wasn't even hungry, I was just thinking I'd try it since finding a slice of pizza in Austin is a hard think to find. I also thought the signage kind of turned me off from the place. It has a healthy and happy and organic kind of signage, which to me doesn't lend to a pizza that I would like. Only after eating at the place did I know if does have some more healthier options. I'd like to say that when eating pizza, eat salad all day then endulge, in my mind without experience I'd say it is worth it.\\n\\nSo, I order a pepperoni slice noticing that the rotating heater of slices is empty. And the person who greets me with a very Itialian accent says he can't serve re-heated pizza as it isn't very good. I'm at a %50 break here, I don't want to wait for a custom made slice of pizza, but for some reason I say I'll wait for it.\\n\\nSo in the time it takes to cook a pizza, I get my one slice. I walk to the car and start eating it as we do in the East coast. And....... the crust is just right. And the sauce is something like nothing in Austin, it's light and almost perfect. And there is a blend of cheese that is magical, like nothing I've had in Austin. This may be the best pizza in Austin.\\n\\nAt this point I'm heading out of the parking lot, but I stop and park and go back into the store. I bust in and ask, \\"Who are you and where do you come from and why is this so good?\\".  They reply is I'm from Seville from the Tuscany region of Italy.\\n\\nI grab a couple of flyiers. I'm going to tell everyone at my company that this may be the best pizza in Austin. I read the back of the flyier and the new chef is from NY and won an award for the best pizza in Ny by I think the NY Post at a cookoff. DO YOU KNOW HOW AMAZING THAT IS!!!!\\n\\nSo I'm blabbering about this place at work, I bring Texas guy again today. He digs the pizza a lot. I'm still jazzed about the place after eating two more slices. The chef sits with us and tells us all about his pizza history, and how he makes it and winning the award.\\n\\nNow pizza is like art, or movies, or brownies, each person has thier own idea of what they like. I hate to use the word good or bad with food as it is a personal taste. But I'd say the pizza they are cooking at this establishement is top notch. It's a light pizza with fresh sauce and a cheese combination that screams incredible. \\n\\nAgain, this being my first review, and it hurts me to give away a secret since I might see an hour long line out the door next time I go. But this is art. This is amazing. Don't get the delivery and be disappointed it took to long, pick it up yourself or eat it at the not so great dining room they have there.\\n\\nI'll be there many more times soon. I'll be introducing my co-workers.

This hotel could use some renovation as it looks a bit 80's. If you want a reasonably priced hotel during a CU football game, drive a bit further out to Broomfield for about a 20 minute drive in.

I think this place is in between a dim sum restaurant and a HK cafe...  There are not a lot of dim sum dishes that you can order. The best is to order a few dim sum dishes and mix in a noodle or rice dish and it's perfect!  \\n\\nThe food came out fast and it was piping hot!  It's hard to explain but Peninsula's dim sum dishes are a bit different from your standard dim sum restaurant.  Check out the pictures attached or try it out yourself.  Service was pretty good!  When we asked for things like a tea refill or hot sauce the waiters and waitresses were very accommodating.

It's not flakey enough and it lacks a bit of sweetness that it used to have. The calamari is not crispy enough. The dough batter is a bit dense. And it's sort of flavourless. It simply lacks seasoning.\\n\\nThe flavour of the string beans was good...but I think there's something about the way it's cooked, that it's not to my personal liking. There's just something about the texture. But it's not a bad dish. I really enjoyed the beef goreng. The spice level was just right for me. I like food a tad spicier than usual. For the most part the beef was cooked really well, but there's this odd piece that was just a tad dry. The sauce covers this up really well though. I'm not a big fan of fish, but the fish curry was done really well. I like how they added okrah to it.\\n\\nThe Pisang Goreng was the highlight of my meal. My sister thought it was too greasy/ oily.

I think I can just sum it up with that if one were in Seattle, I don't think that I'd eat breakfast anywhere else.  It really is THAT good.  I think this is the only place in my life where I've waited an hour for a table and hadn't regretted it for a second after leaving the place.  It's so good that on my recent visit to Portland I ate here for breakfast Saturday morning and returned on Sunday morning.  I can't believe how fair the prices are for the items on the menu. At an equivalent restaurant in Seattle, I expect to pay $2-3 more for comparable dishes, so this was a bonus to a couple great breakfasts.\\n\\nHonestly,  I purposely got drunk on Saturday night at Saucebox so I could pass out faster..meaning before I knew it I'd be up and ready to eat at Mother's again!\\n\\nThis place is so comfy and welcoming, I imagine it's somewhat like getting invited to Paula Deen's house or somethin'.  I like how all the servers are hustling, but don't look panicked or have that look that they'd rather be elsewhere. This operation runs really smooth. The servers that we had on both days were both really pleasant and competent. In fact, at our first breakfast our waitress overheard us talking about how it was my friend's birthday and served her a huuuuuge slice of chocolate cake with a candle in it at the end of our meal.\\n\\nAs far as what I had, of course I had to order the Eggs Benedict and Mother's was quite delicious indeed.  I could have gone for a little bit more flavor in the Hollandaise, maybe some seasoned salt could've helped. But otherwise, I've never had eggs poached so friggin perfectly that I almost didn't want to break them.  The potatoes served on the side were one of the best I've had in a while.  Just a well-rounded Eggs Benny, just like I love.  The coffee they serve there is Stumptown, which is probably  my favorite in the PNW. I had 4 cups and didn't need any sugar or cream.  Even after enjoying my meal, I immediately knew what I would order the next time I got a chance to eat here.\\n\\nAnd sure as hell, I ordered the Crunchy French Toast the next day with the large bowl of fruit as a side because I was starving.  The CFT was as bomb as I thought it would be.  Mother's knows that Challah makes the best main ingredient for the best French toast and with the corn flakes supplying the crunch there isn't more you could ask for.   The fruit bowl consisted of pears, apples, bananas, and pineapple and all were perfectly ripe.  Maybe the small fruit bowl would be better for one person, but luckily I had 5 of my friends to nibble the morsels with me.\\n\\nThere really isn't any other place you need to get breakfast at in PDX, unless you can't wait.

But ok, I get it, some people want their pizza cut into slices and served on a pizza pedestal so they can eat it with their hands.  So I'll assume they know the right way to serve Neapolitan pizza but are just catering to customer desires.  I ordered the Pizza Margherita ($8 on Mondays).  The center was \\"soupy\\" as a good Neapolitan should be, although cutting it let some of the \\"soup\\" leak under the slices in the middle of the pie.  Crust was great - chewy, right amount of crisp, and a great yeasty/fermented flavor.  Nice work - maybe one suggestion is to ask patrons if they want the pizza cut or not and served on a plate.  Will definitely come back again when I'm in Orlando."},{"name":"Yaletown Brewing Company","address":"1111 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I stopped in for dinner on a weeknight without knowing much about this spot. Overall, this brewpub is large, inviting, and casual. We had no problem getting a table at 6pm without a reservation. I did not try the beer, so can only comment on food. The steak salad sounded incredible, but I was somewhat disappointed. The steak was cooked well (medium) but very salty. The salad was overdressed in my opinion. I would definitely ask for dressing on the side. There was a tiny bit of tomato compote which was delicious but very small.

Immediately I was impressed walking in. Very nice ambience (it is Brookline after all), clean, well managed. Made me feel good upon entering.

We split a serving of challah bread French toast. \\n\\nThe coffee was excellent, might I add! Food came quickly and it was with fresh fruit for breakfast sides included. I must say it was better than expected. My hash browns were perfect and instead of salt, they put parmesan (the kind you shake? ) to add the salty flavor, but with the cheesey kick... :) The challah came with real maple syrup, a plus. \\n\\n\\nThe price wasn't bad at all considering the day before we spent the same amount at a place, that i wish I listened to my fellow yelpers about. \\n\\nI have to come here again for lunch and try this again!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I appreciate the wall of cannoli choices.

The other burger was a Swiss and mushroom. No seasoning on the mushrooms, very thrown together and haphazard. The Idaho nachos are fries, bacon, cheese and sour cream.

Between Hei La Moon, Chau Chow City, this place, and Emperor's Garden, I would put China Pearl's dim sum as the best overall.  They are the most consistently good in the sense that every dish is well made, even if its competitors have the upper hand in a few individual selections.  The deal breaker here is that none of the rice flour wrapped dumplings are mucky and greasy.\\n\\nChao zhou fen guo (chiu zao fun gaw if you wanna be all cantonese) is sweet solace for me at dim sum because it's one of the rare, rare dishes that isn't loaded with pork or shrimp.  There's some veggies, cilantro I think, water chestnut, peanuts and little meat scraps inside.  It's great here, while many of the other places have mucky starchy fillings.  I believe hei la moon has a good one, but chau chow's is bad, as is emperor's.\\n\\nThe rice noodle standby chiong fun is delicious here, comparable to the dim sum houses in Guang Zhou.  It's perfectly soft, but not overly greasy.  It always has a little bit of glutenous chew.\\n\\nThey had this one fried shrimp ball dish with a longan in the middle which I was crazy about has a kid.  I've grown out of that phase, but it is pretty tasty and worth a try.\\n\\nShrimp dumplings, tripe, chicken's feet, beef balls, and steamed spare ribs are all of a high quality, equaling, if not besting its competitors.  I've always found the Chicken Feet to be best at China Pearl.  The sauce isn't overly sweet, and it has a lot of flavor from the black beans.  The Shumai taste good as well, and are not the behemoths that they serve at hei la moon, which is nice.  I like being able to eat shumai in one bite.\\n\\nOverall, I'd say Hei La Moon is almost as good, and also a place you can't go wrong with for dim sum, but China Pearl is at a more convenient location and I like it just a little bit more."},{"name":"Whole Foods Market","address":"12601 Hill Country Blvd","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"3.5","text":"On a Sunday afternoon a couple months ago, I did a whirlwind tour of all the WFM stores in Austin.

We ordered food at 6:45 and the food did not arrive at our table until 8:20 -  after getting up, searching down the waiter and asking him several times what the problem seemed to be!  The waiter kept telling us they were just really busy.  This was a Saturday evening and I would suspect, no more busy than typical.  Even worse  - two of the hamburgers ordered were stone cold.    The waiter never stopped at the table to ask if we needed anything.  The manager did come to the table at one point to say the food would be ready momentarily (we'd asked to cancel our order) but it was still another 30 minutes.

We were seated promptly and, a huge selling point for me, were treated well the entire night.  I can't tell you how many times I've been shunned by a server at an higher class restaurant because of my age.  The table settings are intimate with candles on the tables and a simple heavy fork and knife combination to accompany you through the first course of your meal.  The dining room layout, on the other hand, is severly packed, intruding on the intimacy of your table.  We had a \\"ghetto-rigged\\" six top positioned adjacent to our table which was obviously a four top.  One of their patrons chair's leaned against our table!  The bar area is severely crowded, and I suspect this is THE place to go get drunk after work.  There were plenty of LOUD tables with suits occupying the seats.\\n\\nThe food was the most inconsistent part of my meal.  I've heard great things about this restaurant and had high expectations.  The veal sweetbreads risotto I ordered in a delight was more watery than creamy.  The rice, although freshly made, was undercooked and had not released all of it's starchy goodness.  My dish arrived much later than it was prepared, with a skin on top and room temperature. The sweetbreads' excessive amount of Madeira sauce spilled into the rice, causing the sloppy result.  The sweetbreads, on the other hand, were cooked divinely, maintaining a tender, velvety bite and accompanied by a mild sauce accentuating the sweetbreads; definitely the defining and redeeming part of the dish.\\n\\nThe prices are what you'd expect, and reasonable for what you get.\\n\\nAll in all the experience was on the positive end of the spectrum, but I feel wary rounding the 3.5 review up to a four instead of down to a three.

I took my traveling companions and just warned them that it might be more fast food based on pictures on yelp. I was pleasantly surprised to find very friendly counter service, a \\"free\\" basket of chips and salsa since we were first timers and plenty of interesting options. I had the carnitas tostadas which were quartered  crispy corn tortillas with pork and the usual suspects. The pork had a good flavor, better than I expected. My partner had the chicken flautas which were only lightly fried, but quite good with guacamole, refried beans and rice. I got a side of queso which was also quite good, not too thick or spicy. Our friends got quesadillas and chimichangas with an order of guacamole and chips. They were quite happy with their meal and service. We explored the salsa bar a bit, but mainly stuck to the basic salsa, queso and guacamole. As we were packing up leftover chips and salsa, one of the servers asked if we wanted a free refill of salsa or guacamole. Wow, I've never heard of a free refill on guac! We had so much chips left, we jumped at the guacamole and enjoyed it with the chips later. The garlic in the guac really bloomed the longer it sat, so it was very pronounced but quite delicious."},{"name":"Asian Gourmet","address":"794 Elm St","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"For being outside of Boston and in a very small quaint town, Asian Gourmet is hidden gem for its authentic taiwanese dishes. \\n\\nTheir menu is viewable online and the number of items is a lot.

From Taiwanese sausages to tripe to hot pots, this place has very reasonable priced and tasty dishes.\\n\\nOn my visit, I had the Beef Shank and Tripe in Chili Sauce and the Spicy Beef Noodle soup. Both were excellent. Was not \\"americanized\\" and portions were just right. The beef shank and tripe had a good mixture of both and the flavor of the mix was not too spicy nor salty. The broth of the soup was delicious plenty of veggies and meat in the soup.\\n\\nAlso, if you enjoy sake, a Large Hot Sake is about $8. The large isnt really a large but for $8, it's worth the price. \\n\\nOverall, service was decent. In other reviews, bad service was mentioned but during my visit, I did not experience anything negative. The hibachi grill in the middle of the restaurant is a bit odd.

It doesn't say on the menu, but this roll had jalapenos on top of it!  The roll came together very nicely as the cajun seasoned grilled shrimp inside was hugged together by a tempura asparagus and cucumber topped with snow crab, pico de gallo, lime, and cilantro.  Very unique and sounds like a weird combination for sushi but I assure you it is delicious!  One of my favorites, in fact!\\n\\nThe Alaskan Crunch is great for smoked salmon fans!  It had snow crab salad stuffed inside with tempura flakes which gave it nice texture and crunch!  It was topped with smoked salmon and drizzled lightly with eel sauce.  I loved this roll!  Simple and delicious!  \\n\\nI hate when places over-do it with the eel sauce and their whole sushi menu ends up tasting the same: Eel sauce'd and spicy mayo'd up.

I have not had a better Jamaican food ANYWHERE on the eastern seaboard.  Everything is made from scratch, is fresh, and is prepared with a ridiculous amount of flavor.  Most everything they make is a winner and I haven't gotten to their curry or jerk chicken dishes yet, or to their coco bread and patties.  Here's what I've had that I would absolutely order again and recommend in this order:\\n\\n1) Curried Crab - Eat this and you know these folks take food seriously.  Poseidon would put this on his Caribbean meal rotation.  Offered on Saturdays Only.  For the customer ordering this, N.B., you will need crackers.  You get the whole crab shell and all.   \\n\\n2) Brown Stewed Chicken - Slammin'.  \\n\\n2) Ox Tails - It's not a typo.  Ox Tails are tied for 2 with Brown Stewed Chicken.\\n\\n3) Curry Goat - A respectable rendition.\\n\\n4) Escovich Fish - There is nothing wrong with this dish, it's on the delicate side of flavor, so 1-3 have a greater Jamaican association for me and appeal to my taste buds.  You will get the entire red snapper - head to tail.  Also a Saturdays Only Special.  Also, while I have heard of escovich fish, and have a recipe for it, this is my first experience with it.  To be fair, my frame of reference is nil.    \\n\\nIf you like soup.  There are 2, Mannish Wata and Fish Tea.  Mannish wata is considered an aphrodisiac made from various goat parts.  I'm too much woman for mannish water, but just the right amount of mermaid for Fish Tea.  Fish Tea is light and spicy but thickened ever so slightly with potato starch.  I would avoid this is you don't savor a slight burn at the back of the throat.  It's liken to good rum, or a 20 year old tawny.  My one recommendation to the chef is to scale the fish prior.  Sucking in fish scales from a spoon is similar to chewing chicken wings and discovering a feather was still attached.  My best association for chicken feathers is dirty Chinese takeout.  Since your customers can see your kitchen, you can't be compared to dirty Chinese takeout.  Please.  Please. Please remove the scales.            \\n\\nOh yes, and their dumplings!  These hardly ever made it home.  (I've moved out of state and I miss you - all of 1-3 and then some.)  Fried flour balls slightly larger than doughnut holes.  These are just ridiculous.  Also, their cabbage is enviably good.  It is steamed perfectly and seasoned as though it is being served straight out of St Catherine's parish.\\n\\nI've found their rice and peas to be a mere vehicle for what goes on top.  Think of it as the vanilla of ice creams.   It is simple.  Almost too simple.  So, it doesn't get great until the curries from curried goat, brown stewed chx, and curried crab are ladled on top.  Rite Spice does have Jamaican soda, coconut candy, and a few other accouterments to round off a Jamaican meal, but if I am to be painstakingly honest, none of them do it for me.  I prefer to get my coconut candy, carrot juice, sorrel drink, or bedroom bully from Jamaican Flavor about 10 minutes away.  So, go grab these, then drive over to Rite Spice, head to your destination with your goodies and eat, drink and unbuckle yourself!  You'll probably eat til \\"busted\\". \\n\\nAlso note.  While RS has high top window seats it is a takeout joint.  There is no restroom.  Credit cards are accepted (not sure about Amex).  They are closed on Sundays and possibly Mondays.  If you want the best they have to offer, get there early - well in advance of closing time.  Several family members have complained about meals received just before closing.  This was never my experience, but then again, they know my face."},{"name":"Kick Butt Coffee","address":"5775 Airport Blvd, Ste 725","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went to Kick Butt last Sunday, looking for a quiet place to write and do homework.

I also ordered a brownie, which was actually one of the best brownies I've ever had. The coffee was perfectly decent, but three days later, I'm wishing I had another one of those brownies.\\n\\nI was there for almost five hours. It was a great place to get some work done, just quiet enough with some good music.

This bowl of Pho at Linh Cafe will be astounding to the palate who has eaten a real bowl of hot goodness. \\n\\nFor the rest of us, we will cry and complain over the absence of bean sprouts, basil, lime and the like. We will fret over the lack of any Srircha or sweet Hoisin sauce in hindsight. That my friend is not how Hanoians eat their Pho. The true original northern flavours of this dish is eaten with nothing more than the addition of pickled chillies, garlic and/or pearl onions in some households and a nice dusting of freshly cracked black pepper. Traditionally fish sauce is sometimes offered as a condiment so the patron can adjust the broth to their taste if not satisfied. When you are in Hanoi every restaurant will have a plate of chinese doughnuts on every table the goal is to take a doughnut and dip it into the pho broth and eat only if you choose to of course and you should because it is delicious! It sounds strange but it is very traditional. I was in a Vietnamese restaurant in Prague, Czech Republic (huge northern Vietnamese community in Prague 7) that had the doughnuts and it was hands down the best Hanoi style pho that I've had outside of Hanoi. That's it, those are the only things you need to add to the delicious savoury broth. \\n\\nI would like to say that as a Vancouverite our palate has been over exposed to sweet and overly spiced (star anise and 10 pounds of cinnamon anyone?) pho broth that has tried to pass itself off as authentic pho in many of the multitude Vietnamese restaurants this city has to offer. We are accustomed to the southern Saigon style of pho which is noticeably sweet and heavily spiced. If you have been to Saigon you will reasonate with me. The food in different regions of Vietnam varies greatly, as with most countries but most notably the main difference in this certain country is through the seasoning. Food in the south is always seasoned more on the sweeter side. The dishes from the north favour a more savoury bite. Take your pick. \\n\\nBest bowl of pho in Vancouver right now."},{"name":"Taste of Punjab","address":"4980 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Ste 192","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!!

We ordered 3 appetizers and out of that the fresh water oysters with spicy condiments were fantastic and the rest ( potato chips laden with blue cheese were soggy and over seasoned and the fried calamari were just ok) were borderline meh! Among the entrees shrimp and grits ( not in the menu, but they will cook it for you upon request) and crab cakes are worth mentioning and everything else, including the \\"market priced\\" poached lobsters were overcooked and bland. Our server Tailor was knowledgeable and friendly. We were a fairly big group (8 adults and and four kids) and we knew we were going  to be merry and noisy so we opted to sit on the patio which was a fantastic decision. I am not sure though if that justifies our pretty big bill ($600+) , but with the river being so close and access to the garden made us feel that were at a catered picnic and that alone felt darn good. The kids played in the garden, we enjoyed the view and with free  flowing wine ( Clos du Val among others) our less than fantastic food was soon forgotten and overall we had a very pleasant evening and I might go back just to recapture the moment.

We had taken our kids here several times for the walk up dessert and knew the dessert was awesome, but the long wait times had always kept us away from the dinner. This weekend on a girl's trip we didn't have the kids, so we had nothing but time! The wait was worth it. Also, if you are staying at a Universal resort and you mention it to the hostess it cuts your wait time in half! Woot Woot! So we waited 25 min! The Steampunk theme was so cute inside. The pictures really do not do it justice. The menu is so big, that it really does have something for everyone. I really wish we had come more hungry, because I wanted to get some of everything. I tried the vanilla chocolate cocktail which was delicious but very strong. I also tried the mushroom, goat cheese flat bread which I would definitely recommend if you are a mushroom lover. My friend got the french onion soup which was to die for. The waiter was Jon and he was very attentive and fun. The restaurant has the robots Penelope and Jacques that go around and interact with the patrons which is also a fun touch. The prices for dinner was also on point with the other restaurants in City Walk, so if you are going to eat in City walk and you have been wanting to try this place, do it. If you do decide to skip the dinner part, you can always go for dessert in the front. There isn't a lot of seating for the dessert only so you will want to have a member of your party looking for a seat while you order.

I say that to say, before you venture off, make sure you've tried all of the cannoli's. Red velvet is the make or break cake. When executed well, it is seriously the best baked good you will ever consume...this however, was not that serious. The cake itself was good and moist but the color was off (red brown) and the taste was chocolatey, lastly, the frosting was not buttercream! It tasted like cake frosting. Like I said...it was a good cupcake, but when you put yourself in the red velvet arena--be prepared for some scrutiny.

It was a standard Dim Sum time, great! We had a bit of a bad vibe when my girlfriend (who is a Beijing native) was told by one of the cart-ladies that her Mandarin pronunciation was so bad that they could not understand her! But we shrugged it off as a one time thing.\\n\\nSo, when I had two friends in town and they wanted to grab a bite in Chinatown I suggested we try the downstairs China Pearl diner. The food was also very good (I highly suggest Buddha's Paradise - or maybe it was Buddhists Paradise).\\n\\nWe had a great time and then we got the bill. One of my friends payed it with card and we were about to leave when the waiter stops us because my friend forgot to sign the receipt (oops) and to complain that we haven't tipped enough (what!). He says that my friend hasn't even tipped 10%, when 15% is standard. Okay, so maybe my friend made a mistake, less than 10% is a pretty small tip, etc. etc. But that isn't the end of it. After my friend changes his tip, the waiter comes back with a calculator and computes the percentage before telling us that it is okay!\\n\\nNow, I understand that waiting tables can be a tough living and that they depend on tips for a reasonable portion of their income and I always try to give 15-20% for good service.

Sadly, I don't know what they were exactly but everything was tasty so if it sounds appealing to you; I'd suggest you order it.  We didn't get it but whenever I go to Enoteca I always get the mussels (which are really from Vespaio but they still let you order them).  They are soooooo good.  Get extra french bread, you'll need it!\\n\\nI ordered the crab bisque to start and the Spaghetti Alla Cabonara.\\nHandmade spaghetti tossed in a cream sauce with crisp pancetta, scallions, pecorino romano, parmesan frico, poached egg.  I asked about the egg and according to our server, it's traditionally served with a raw egg that you then mix in.  Since people get a little worried about raw eggs, the egg is poached, however, they can leave it out altogether if you prefer.  I went ahead and left the poached egg on.   \\n\\nBoth items were incredibly tasty and I enjoyed every last bit of them.  For dessert I ordered the Sweet Fritters.   I was really full at the time and while they were good, I'd choose something else next time.\\n\\nGreat food, great service and great atmosphere (as well as great friends/conversation).

I am so glad that we got the chance to try this place out this time around. Thankfully we came on a Thursday afternoon so there was no wait.\\nThese are the perfect bite sized donuts to satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling overly heavy. They are just the right amount of crispiness, yet airy and light at the same time. They are essentially mini cake donuts, but not as dense. Since this was our first time we wanted to sample all of the flavors. The seasonal one for us was a spiced peach butter. Our favorites were the dirty wu and the candied bacon maple. The dirty wu is a combination of all the things we like. It was not overly sweet, and each component complemented each other well, not overpowering each other. The candied bacon maple was a nice mix of savory and sweet. Our least favorite was the spiced beach butter, it was a bit too much on the spiced/salty side. It did have some hints of peach, but I personally would have enjoyed more of a peach and honey combo (that is more of a personal preference). \\nI appreciate that they are made FRESH and piping hot. When we first got our order we had to wait a few seconds before we could dig in. I must say that they are better enjoyed immediately. If you leave there for even a day they lose their lightness and airiness. That being said, they are still good after, just not as delicious as when they are freshly made. \\nThey do have a Yelp discount so be sure to check in!"},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Chicken Guy is amazing!

She made a reservation for 10 people. Upon our arrival, the server informed us that someone called to cancel one of two reservations that day, but she wasn't sure which one, so she assumed it was us, and therefore the TARDIS room was no longer available for our party a.k.a. the most money they were going to get that day.\\n\\nThe server commanded us to walk around the restaurant by ourselves to see where else we would like to sit. The only other suitable table was also occupied. We \\"encouraged\\" her to move some people around because the only other place that was suitable for our group was in the bar, and we had a child with us.\\n\\nAfter some under-the-breath exchanges of words (\\"Okaaaay.\\"  \\"These things happen.\\" \\"I'm not perfect,\\" etc.), the server finally relented and told some people to move to another table and we were seated. \\n\\nThe server came out to take our orders. She got to 4 out of 10 people and announced that she had to go get dessert for another table. She came back to say that since the restaurant only had one cook, they were only making appetizers and drinks first. \\n\\nWe continued to order what we wanted, hoping that the kitchen crew was competent enough to sort these things out on their own. \\n\\nNOAAAAP. \\n\\nUpon hearing our full orders, the British Brute (owner/chef) ran out of the kitchen and told us in his flustered voice that he only wanted us to say what we want to drink and what we wanted as appetizers BUT WE CAN'T ORDER THE MAIN COURSE YET...because someone might want Pepsi as their main course and that can be confusing. \\n\\nThey got the drinks wrong. The server and her doppleganger (a frumpy-looking woman with the face of death and destruction who was -dying- to be there) brought drinks out, some of which none of us ordered. The British Hulk continued to talk down to the server as I observed in horror. He told her that she wrote down 3 Dr. Peppers, and that was what he made, so that's that, and he did it right and she did it wrong!\\n\\nWe finally  got to order our food (oh, what a privilege in this fine establishment). We arrived at 2:00 p.m. and received our main course at around 3:15 p.m. There were only three groups of people there. This was long enough for the server to ask us to get out of the way so that she could dangerously reach over and change the Doctor Who DVD that they were showing. \\n\\nWhen the server came back to take our plates away, she successfully flipped a basket over and spilled food on two of our friends and a baby! \\n\\nAlthough I have a deep appreciation for technology, I felt that using the iPad as the \\"check\\" was horribly uncouth. It was a terrible experience for her to read each person's cost semi-loudly. It was also uncomfortable for me to see her standing there while people felt obligated to tip her, despite the lack of professionalism, as they signed her iPad. \\n\\n...and while I have never seen an episode of Doctor Who, I felt like if they could call that room the TARDIS room, my one Darth Vader poster at home allows me to call my place the Death Star. \\n\\nSo if you ever want to visit The Fish & Chip Shop, remember to order in baby steps, otherwise they might think you want a venereal disease rather than dessert when you order Spotted Dick.\\n\\nEdit: And bring some latex gloves because their menus have seen better days. They are so crinkled and water damaged and hard to read due to the light bouncing of the lumps and bumps of the paper awkwardly.

The Brussels sprouts were also very tasty and perfectly cooked.  Nice sweet and salty combo.   The macaroni was by far the best I've ever had.  A mixture of two types of American cheese along with goat cheese.  Creamy, chewy, and slightly soupy in a good way.  No here is the bad.  I ordered the brisket.  This was the driest brisket I have ever had.  It tasted as if it had sat in the window for too long.  It came to the table grey with a pink smoke ring.  No juice at all almost as if it were dehydrated.  I poured a ton of the mustard bbq sauce on it however it was still flavorless and chewy.  Everything else was very good but I just can't give (5) stars when the main attraction was not good.  I would still advise others check it out.  I may have caught them in a bad night.

The only thing that could have made the experience better - Home Made Sweet Potato Fries (IMHO).\\n\\nI loved that they had a large galvanized animal troth turned planter out front with fresh herbs and greens growing inside. \\n\\nThey sit next door to the Gibson Bar and have seating on their outdoor dog-friendly patio.

You can find some of the old favorites like The World of Disney, Rainforest Cafe, LEGO Store, Earl of Sandwich, AMC Theaters, House of Blues and a couple more. However, the new additions are very welcome like The Boathouse (yummy oysters), Francesca's (fun gifts and clothing), Zara (for the fashionistas), Sephora (glam girls, where you at?), STK (steak anyone?), and the list goes on and on! Parking is free but the garages can get pretty hectic, especially on weekend nights. If you've never been here before, you can easily spend at least 5 hours checking out the shops and restaurants.

She wasn't excited about the food when we asked her if she would recommend this dish or that dish. She basically said she didn't like any of it. Not those words exactly but that's what she implied.

There are many ways to look at reviewing. Some people write reviews based on what they want versus what they got. Some people write reviews based on how well the business delivers what is expected. This review aims to be the latter.\\n\\nThe prices: yes, they are a little pricier. That is accurate. Think about some of the better known sandwich places. You pay almost as much and sometimes less at Bunk and you get a lot more sandwich. There's upscale, and then there's just plain pricey for what it is, but sometimes there are mitigating factors.\\n\\nThe coffee: I have a fairly uncomplicated coffee life, so I haven't experienced anything unusual here. You either like Ristretto or you don't. It's not my favorite for drip, but whatever. It's certainly a respectable local roaster.\\n\\nThe pastries: I've never had anything that did not deliver in this department, and frankly their danishes (especially the lemon curd) are 110% worth the calories and the carb rebound.\\n\\nThe kids: If you don't like dining around a lot of kids, then indeed this is not a good place for you. It is often crowded with them. This is the kind of place Posies to wants to be, and on that they seem to deliver. I usually take my order to go.\\n\\nThe staff: this is where I believe all of the negative reviews have Posies dead to rights. Chilly service. I've been there a lot. I tip well. I was a barista and bonafide cool person for 3 years. I do not get it. The owner claims the high prices are justified to pay you a living wage (something I applaud and support), and yet I still feel like I, the customer, need to apologize and try to cheer you up, because you're stuck in a crappy service job. This is a neighborhood place, and one of the keys to this format is friendliness and recognition of regular customers. Every other business on the block has friendlier staff (but worse coffee). This is Kenton, not Westover Heights, and Kenton has shown you guys a lot of love. Can you just try to fake some appreciation? You guys could be local icons, instead we just mutually tolerate each other until something better comes along. What a shame."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"We just visited Disney Springs since the transition from Downtown Disney. This new makeover reminds me of IKEA (in a bad way). You have to wind yourself through a maze to find things. The parking experience has improved significantly but the tall buildings no longer allow the open feeling downtown Disney used to have. They also have a lot of high end shops here that, to me, do not fit in with the Disney feel. I miss the old downtown Disney and open feeling and feeling the breeze off the lake. But this will not stop us from visiting again because there are some great restaurants here. \\n\\nIf you have a stroller be aware getting on the elevator in the parking garage is very cumbersome. First getting in the elevator period is difficult as they are always full. We had to get on it while it was going up then take it back down. Then it doesn't go all the way down to the bottom floor.

A Vancouver institution, White Spot brings back the memory of simpler times. The recent upgrades to the menu were much needed, but with them the prices have risen. They're starting to price themselves out of their sweet spot, and starting to compete against the likes of Cactus Club, Earls and Joeys, and frankly, I rather take my money there if I'm going to spend $18-20/meal.

It's a pretty chill place to be, there seems to be lots of people there (even on a Tuesday night) and has a good atmosphere. The husband is impressed by their beer selection, and I'm really looking forward the summers when they move out to the patio. (Well really, I'm really looking forward to the summer because it'll STOP SNOWING, but that's a rant for another time and place.) Also, the giant plate of fries with cheese and gravy delivers on its promise of fatty goodness every single time. \\n\\nThe Bad: Most of the food isn't great. The salads and entrees are overpriced and not that great. Stick to the fatty bar food appetizers and beers.\\n\\nThe Ugly: DON'T GET THE HUMMUS. It's gross. Like worse than the cheapest grocery store hummus gross. The store hummus at trader joes is way better than this. I am actually offended by how bad the hummus was.

The cookie dough was cute, but I may have broken a tooth on the coco nibs (spelling?). The banana sundae was the star. The salted caramel and toppings were lovely.

It was a couple dollars more than the \\"boat\\", so why not with the groupon. It was a bad idea.\\n\\nThe Nigiri was ok - 12 pieces. The rolls were terrible. They gave us two orders of california rolls. That's a lot of filler.  The entree included a rainbow roll, which is basically another california roll with a thin layer of fish on top. I get it, they want to max out profits. But that's short term thinking as I'll never order that platter again if I were to come back.  The rolls have avocado and they were all unripe.  Unripe avocado is hard and bitter, but they decided to make all the rolls with it anyway. This tells me two things. One, the chef is bad and doesn't know that unripe avocados are hard and taste bitter and doesn't know how to quickly ripen avocados. Or two, the chef would rather put out bad product for the sake of saving $.50 of avocado.\\nThere was also a cooked salmon roll which had little flavor and a lot of the unripe avocado.\\nThe only good roll was tuna roll.\\n\\nService was ok this time.

Seriously. Coming from a family of accomplished bakers, part of me feels guilty because my first bite of Petsi's berry pie brought me slightly more joy than all of the warmy love and experience my grandmother and aunts poured into their treats. Basically, Petsi pies taste like rainbow.\\n\\nOn my first visit, I purchased a selection of their mini savory pies. Standouts were the chicken pot pie, potato mushroom, and roasted vegetable with goat cheese. The mild but distinct flavor of the chicken pot pie allowed the more subtle flavor of the veggies to come through. The crust held up after having been slightly thawed and baked in my oven and was not at all soggy. Pleasantly caramelized peppers, broccoli, and onions crowned the roasted veggie pie. This pie also featured generously sized crumbles of smooth and delectable goat cheese. Potato mushroom also won points on flavor and texture, definitely my favorite of the bunch. The bacon leek swiss and spinach ricotta were more along the lines of what one would find in a typical gourmet bakery. Tasty, but not grandmother-rivaling. \\n\\nMost recently, I tried the key lime pie, lemon bar, and tart cherry crumb. As with the berry pie (a medley of rhubarb(?), strawberry, balckberry, and raspberries--perhaps more), the cherry and key lime were uniformly excellent. The key lime prickled my tongue with its perfect tartness and I approved of the texture, although more than one slice would have proven too rich for me. (For the record, I have never tried a genuine southern key lime pie and do not know whether Petsi Pies uses key limes.)  Lemon bars can be delightful, but I was unable to enjoy Petsi Pies' version because the crust was bland and almost ridiculously thick.

We easliy split it with a knife and was satisfied with the crispy crunchy coated moist dark meat chicken, soft bun, and the crisp slaw, and creamy sauce.  It stood firmly in first place till nudged somewhat by the 4th dish we later added to our order.\\n\\nThe Silver Queen Corn $8 (parmesan, bone marrow, bonito, aioli, hot sauce) vied for first place for my DC, also against the same late arriving contender.  It was a rich mix of savory sweet flavors, and would have ideally been served with grilled olive oiled bread.  It needed something to chew against.  So we made do with the boring room temperature soft centered hard crusted baguette chunks that arrived when we inquired whether we could have some bread.  It wasn't ideal, but surely better than nothing.\\n\\nThe Manti (Istanbul Meat Ravioli) $14 (garlic sour cream, red pepper butter) was ordered under the advisement of our server.  It came as a petite plate of 7 dumplings, each garnished with an even hand.  I had expected something like the Mantwo from Helmand, and wasn't particularly hopeful, since it had been so overshadowed by the Kaddo pumpkin appetizer that lives forever in my dining memories.  The meat filling of these manti were flavorful, but gamey.  It wasn't to our taste, which was evidenced by the fact that neither of us fought for the extra 7th piece.\\n\\nThe BLT Lettuce Wraps $12 (lamb bacon, pimento cheese, tomato jam, pickled red onion) was the final add in to our meal.  After our first round of wraps, we discovered some surprise peach slices hidden beneath the lettuce leaves.  We enjoyed this small plate very much, and decided that the pimento cheese was the only player that could have easily been dismissed from the party with no detriment to the dish.

Seriously, for the injeera bread? That's like a mexican restaurant making you wait for tortillas. The food actually was pretty good but I don't think it was worth waiting an hour for. The other thing that takes the score down was our rude server. The young hipster girl that works for the family that runs the place needs to be canned. She was exceptionally snotty. On a positive note, the owner personally came out to see how we were liking the meal. He made a big fuss over my friends three year old and gave her a little treat. He was classy and nice."},{"name":"Karma - Concord","address":"105 Thoreau St","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"This place is overrated.

We met a family in the line ahead of us who were from Tennessee and I told them the line was not as bad as it seemed because they were very efficient. Another patron asked us if we had already put in our order and we said no and were confused. Oh she said and proceeded to butt her way to the front of the line and tried to pick up 5 cakes. From the back of the line we did not notice this immediately. An hour and a half later when I finally got to the front I realized our wait was because of that woman blocking one entire case off smooshing the lines together. The staff was attending to her order on the case as opposed with behind in the back. I don't think it was right that they were not prepared for her order and they that let her butt in front of the others.

Not quite up to the level of a true restaurant burger, but great for fast food.

I mean, Whataburger advertises \\"Just like you like it\\", but seriously, what burger joint is going to say \\"NO! YOU MUST HAVE MAYO INSTEAD OF MUSTARD!  NO SUBSTITUTIONS!\\"  \\n\\nWell, I'm sure there's some local, natural, anti-GMO, organic, hipster, Austin original place out there that takes that stance on burgers, but yeah...it's not normal.\\n\\nWhat was unusual about this particular Whataburger was how incredibly friendly the staff was.  They were quick enough, and my order was simple, but correct, but what really struck me was that they went out of their way to be friendly and nice.  That's not normal for fast food,and certainly not normal for fast food at 1am on a Saturday night.  Maybe they were just happy that I wasn't drunk or high and was easy to understand, i dunno.  Regardless, it's a much better environment in which to sit and eat than, say, a Waffle House or a Denny's, which tend to have questionable service and loud, irritating customers during the same time frame.  The location might have something to do with the less unruly crowd.  You couldn't get much further from 6th street and still be in Austin, which is a plus, in my opinion.  \\n\\nAlso worth mentioning is that Whataburger's chicken tenders are also really good, some of the best I've ever had, and their gravy that they put with it is great.

It's located right on the banks of the Chattahoochee River, and if you get a table by the windows (seriously, get a table by the windows), you get a beautiful view to enjoy your meal.\\n\\nFood - while some of the items in the buffet are better elsewhere, over all, you probably won't find such quality food at a buffet.  Multiple salads and cold items, carving station with multiple options, omelet station, eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles, French toast, and oh so much wonderful wonderfulness.\\n\\nIf I am being fair, I should probably go down to 3.5 for some of the short comings.  First of all, this was my second time here.  First time was for their New Years Day brunch buffet a few years ago.  The buffet then was larger - had more options - and was also cheaper.  Price went up this time - around $30.  Secondly, while my girlfriend's coffee came with the meal, my hot tea did not, and I thought that was dumb.  I would understand if it was specialty herbal teas or something, but it was that Royal Cup brand, or something.  The type you'd see in a hotel room.  Third, and I suppose it's possible I missed it, but no bread station.  They had croissants out, but no toaster with bagels and breads.  Perhaps you could request it, but I remembered breads from the last time.  Finally, their dessert station was weak.  It was much much better for New Years, but this time, everything was coconut or some not-so-great dessert.  No apple pie or apple cobbler (the cobbler was peach), no key lime pie, no blueberry dessert.  They have chocolate chip cookies and brownies, but that was about it.  There's no problem with different desserts, but you should also have the basics everyone loves.\\n\\nAll of that said, I'm still giving Ray's 4 stars, without rounding up.

As is often done for conferences, a conference rate was advertised and I jumped on it.  A while later, much closer to the actual trip, my partner found an even lower rate on Get A Room.com.  So we booked that, knowing that it overlapped with the original booking.  Happily, this was not a problem for Marriott.  What I find strange is that this even lower rate was not offered for the conference.  But... this was a small meeting with relatively low attendance, so that may account for it.\\n\\nOkay... so we have checked in and get our room.  Everything is hunky-dory and there are no problems.  Except that the elevators are slower than the molasses that flooded Boston in 1919.  There are three banks of elevators, with two of them (\\"Bank 1\\" and \\"Bank 2\\") serving floors 1-26 and the third (\\"Bank 3\\") serving floors 1-5 & 27-38.  A strange touch screen system is used to call the elevators, with one screen for both Banks 1 and 2, and one screen for Bank 3.  The two call systems are not linked.  What would make sense in a case like this is to have a system that asks what floor you are going to and assigns an elevator to you.  I have heard of such systems at other locations, and they work splendidly.  Oh well.  For at least the past three years at this hotel the elevators have been the major point of contention among Yelp reviewers.  The hotel claims to be making moves towards fixing the elevator service, but for the moment it remains slow, slow, ssssllllllllooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww.\\n\\nI guess that was more of an analysis of the elevators than was necessary, but I just had to get it off my chest.  It's so frustrating to see such under-utilization of technology in today's world.\\n\\nHotel service was lovely.

Never asking how our dinner was or anything like that. One guy asked if our meals were phenomenal, all we could do was literally laugh out loud. As for our dinners I ordered the cowboy ribeye and my girlfriend ordered the filet mignon. Both steaks were way over cooked and not seasoned at all. I ordered my steak medium rare and it was medium/medium well at best. Had the toughness of a pork chop and the edges were burnt, actually black from the heat, which I could have lived with but paying $50 for a steak..that thing better be perfect.

Yummy!\\n\\nMy only complaint is probably the cost of the crawfish.  Because the price is not posted on the menu, you will order about 3-5 pounds before realizing how much that yumminess is going to cost you.  I could have asked, but after living in Houston for three years and where everyone has crawfish from anywhere from $2.99 to $4.99 a lb., I didn't bother. \\n\\nIn the end, the waitress told me it was based on market prices and that week, the crawfish was $7.99 a pound.

We shared the Canadian Cheddar Cheese Soup, Steak Tartare, and Le Cellier Signature Poutine as appetizers and then the Le Cellier Filet Mignon as our entree.\\n\\nQuality\\nI believe very few restaurants located in Disney World could survive outside the confines of the theme parks, but Le Cellier is absolutely one of them. The food that we ate was absolutely delicious, and while they definitely stretch to incorporate Canada, they know how to serve up a solid steak. We started our meal with the Canadian Chedder Cheese Soup and Le Cellier Signature Poutine, two things you almost feel obligated to order to justify the restaurant's existence in Canada. The soup was solid with infusions of beer and applewood-smoked bacon, and do not hesitate to dip the pretzel bread in it. The poutine meanwhile had fresh cut fries covered with cheddar, truffles, and a red wine reduction. I could have used a bit heavier gravy, but it too was a nice treat. The Steak Tartare is incredible and is a must order. A unique mix of beef, brandy, truffle poached egg, potato crips, picked vegetables, and bone marrow, each and every bite rich and tasty. Then there was our entree, Le Cellier Filet Mignon. A perfectly cooked steak, served over a mushroom risotto, asparagus-tomato relish, and a truffle-butter sauce. Rich and creamy, the sauce with the risotto is almost as good as the steak.\\n\\nQuantity\\nWe arrived at the restaurant for a late lunch, so we were hungry from an already long day. The appetizers were all a fair size with the poutine being a massive helping. The Filet Mignon was 8oz, a good size especially considering it came with some risotto. In all the one entree and three appetizers was the perfect amount of food to fill us up, but not handicap us for the rest of the day.\\n\\nValue\\nThe food at Le Cellier is in line with the prices you should expect at any high-end steakhouse. Our Steak Tartare was $15 and the Filet Mignon was $54. The perception is often that everything in Disney is overpriced, but I think that is generally an unfair assessment. It just often feels that way because much of the food is just average and after paying for the expensive tickets you hope for more. Le Cellier however is a place you can be happy with both the quality and the value.\\n\\nAmbiance\\nLe Cellier is located inside Epcot, one of the Disney World's Orlando theme parks. Found in the Canada pavilion of the world showcase, Le Cellier is a more refined theme park dining experience. The restaurant is underneath the castle looking chateau and is meant to have the appearance of a wine cellar. When you enter they lead you even further down into a single large open room. With high ceilings and stone arches, if is not too difficult to imagine it being a room full of wine barrels. The lighting in the room is dimmed, but not dark, however it is a significant adjustment from the bright sun outside. The seating is arranged so most couples are placed in half booth half tables, while larger groups are placed at tables in the center of the room. No music was played during our visit, but the restaurant was still very loud and almost constantly full.\\n\\nCrowd\\nLe Cellier is one of the most popular full service restaurants in Epcot, and it is not because of any special gimmicks. This is not a restaurant where characters do appearances, there is no live music or dancing, and it does not provide a unique spot to watch the fireworks. It is a place where you will typically find a more adult focused crowd looking to escape the heat and enjoy a delicious meal. Advance reservations are an absolute necessity, much like at any popular steakhouse. But remember this is still Disney World, so don't expect an enforced dress code and know a few screaming children are required to be present at all times. Also, try not to be too upset when you hear people ordering these beautiful steaks well-done.\\n\\nService\\nIn Epcot, each country's pavilion is primarily staffed by employees originally from that country. This extends to the restaurants, as both our hostess and waiter were both born and raised in Canada. In usual Disney fashion they were extremely friendly and delighted to talk to us, especially about Canada. Expect the food to come out quick, as they are aware that many folks are eager to return to the rides, but don't feel rushed as they are happy to let you sit and enjoy.\\n\\nParking\\nThe restaurant is part of the Canada pavilion within Epcot. A ticket to the theme park is required to visit the restaurant and you will have to use the Epcot parking lot or some other form of Disney transportation to get to the park.\\n\\nExtra\\nLe Cellier was an excellent experience and one I would highly recommend for visitors of Epcot still looking for refined dining. Stick with steakhouse standards and you will be very happy. Just don't expect the typical Disney magic and it is probably best to ditch the kids for this meal."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"great food and atmosphere.

That's the primary reason we went.  We were actually looking for a place for breakfast, but then we remembered eating at a place across the street the afternoon prior and this place had lines out the door.  It was absolute mayhem.  But it was organized mayhem, but clearly they are doing something right.  So we happened to walk by and it was empty, let's what the hub-bub was about.\\n\\nI'd rather frequent a place that specializes in a handful of items done well, than a place that offers 20+ cannoli's, among other things.  Just a preference.  And the cannoli's that we had just weren't very good.  It was much better than something you can get at a diner, but this shouldn't be the competition.  The competition is other pastry shops.\\n\\nI was also puzzled as to why we had to pay for the cannoli on one side, then go pay for an espresso on the other side.  What is the logic here?  I guess if they're crowded for their pastries and someone just wants a coffee they wouldn't have to wait?  But it was quite annoying and there probably is a better way to do this.\\n\\nBased on seeing the continuous lines out the door the previous day, I expected more.

We actually drove past on our first try, not realizing that the restaurant was perched right on the corner.  After doubling back, we found the parking lot in the back, and walked rather awkwardly through the back door of the restaurant.\\n\\nWe were greeted by a young woman named Peggy, who remained our helpful and attentive waitress throughout the evening.  \\n\\nThe boy ordered a \\"Berry Blossom,\\" ($8) which apparently was a very good drink, since he raved about it the rest of the night.  It was an astonishing electric blue, and it appeared to have three or four fresh berries in it.  The waitress noted that it is one of their more popular drinks.\\n\\nWe opted to order solely off the sushi menu: salmon nigiri, octopus nigiri, mackerel nigiri, a rainbow roll, and a hurricane roll, which came to around forty-five dollars.  The nigiri were all quite decent, with a good punch of wasabi tucked between the rice and fish.  Usually I am very sensitive to spicy flavours, but this was all right.  The rainbow roll was very flavourful: the usual crabstick and avocado with shrimp, salmon, and other assorted fish wrapped around it.  It was a bit small, with only five or six pieces instead of the expected eight.  I was not particularly impressed with the hurricane roll, which had a variety of fish, roe, and seaweed, wrapped in cucumber.  It was difficult to eat, and only came with five thin pieces, at a cost of $16.  \\n\\nWe left the restaurant pleasantly full, though we probably could have managed another roll without any great difficulty.  For a total full cost of $55 plus tip, I'm not totally convinced of its value.  We will return again once I procure more discounted gift certificates (we're terribly cheap, but that's what happens when you are students with little income and large tuition bills), but wouldn't if we had to pay full price.\\n\\nThe ambiance and lighting were quite pleasant, although too dark at dinner to get any good pictures of the food with my camera phone.

We normally go to the one in Gahanna on Hamilton Road, but today they decided to come out our way, so we decided to go to the Bob Evans in Whitehall on Broad Street. We have four adults and two toddlers between us, so we were seated and right away told the waiter that we would like to order the kids' food first so they would be eating while our food came and no one would get cranky having to sit and wait. But between us telling the waiter this and actually ordering the kids' food, he proceeded to give us his entire life story. Then once we finally got the kids' orders in, he left and came back with their food and asked our orders. They were simple orders for the rest of us, and then he left. Thirty minutes later our food finally arrived, without having someone check on us or tell us it was coming in the meantime. The food was all cold, and one of our friends found a long white hair in her food. When we told the waiter that the food was cold, he said \\"that doesn't make any sense. It took twenty minutes to get the food and now it's cold?\\" Actually...that makes perfect sense. The longer it takes to get the food, the colder it will be. And it wasn't twenty minutes, it was half an hour.\\n\\nAt this point the kids were well past done eating while we were just getting our food, so they were getting cranky and antsy before we had even really started eating. We went and flagged down the assistant manager who commented that it was unacceptable that our food was cold and that it was \\"nasty\\" that my friend found a hair in her food, which she showed him. He was writing this all down on a notepad and he said that he would go adjust our bills and come right back. Twenty minutes later no one had come back, so we got up and went to the register. At that point the assistant manager had not done a thing. He didn't even know whose food was on which bill. So what was he doing during the twenty minutes we were sitting there waiting? Nothing to do with us. We could have gotten up and walked out of the restaurant and no one would have noticed. \\n\\nOverall, the food was bad, the service was awful, and we will not be going back to that Bob Evans ever again."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent service!

Most self-respecting restaurants that sell Perfect Margaritas make them from scratch with real ingredients...and they taste like it.  I complained to our waiter about the margarita and, to his credit, he said he would get me another one.  When he returned, he said that he had added some Grand Marnier to it.  And indeed he did.  He added Grand Marnier to an insipid, watered-down, pitiful drink.\\n\\nThe food??  It is overpriced and made from pre-packaged products.  Take the chili relleno stuffed with shredded pork that I ordered.  Actually, they originally served me with a chicken dish that I hadn't ordered.  When they finally brought the chilis relleno, it was obvious from the taste and appearance that they had been prepared by some off-premises vendor, frozen, and delivered to the restaurant.  The only thing that the kitchen did was heat it up and flop it on a plate with poorly seasoned charo beans and flavorless rice.\\n\\nMy recommendation???  Drive a bit further down Hwy 620 and go to the Iguqna Grille.

Happily it seemed to be, at least all of the old servers were still there anyway.  \\n\\nI went to dinner with a large group of friends last night and we ordered plate after plate of hot and delicious food.  Although I really enjoyed everything we had, I think it would be information overload if I listed out all of the seven items we ordered.  However, the standouts included the crab and fish maw soup that was well seasoned and had more fish maw than I have ever remembered at any other place I've tried.  I also really enjoyed the jade tofu with enoki mushroom dish which was savory and delicious.  I have to admit that the only thing we tried that I wasn't a big fan of was the salted-pepper squid which had too much batter and ended up looking like indistinguishable clumps of fried dough on the plate.  \\n\\nThe place was pretty busy on a Saturday night, but the food arrived quickly and the servers cheerfully gave us plates and a knife for the birthday cupcakes we had brought along.

When you hear 'you're going to have to make yourself dinner tonight' because she's just enjoyed such a fantastic treat, you know it's just that good.  Good on you mom!"},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I would give Strip 3.5 stars if I could. Maybe it's the fact that I lived in the neighborhood for a couple of years and frequent this place fairly often. Or, perhaps it's the fact that I know what NOT to order...either way, Strip has not disappointed. The reason I didn't give a higher rating is because let's be honest, there are much better restaurants in Atlanta. Also, I have never ordered a full steak from here and only order sushi occasionally, so, it doesn't seem quite fair to give a higher rating for a restaurant supposedly known for steak and sushi.\\n\\nOk, now that we have that out of the way...my \\"go to\\" staples are the Miso Soup, Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and Grilled Steak Salad. So far, my steak has always been well cooked, but again, it's bistro style...not a full steak. The crab cake isn't overpowered by filling or breading, which I prefer. And, how can you go wrong with miso soup. My husband usually orders Baby Back Ribs and always enjoys it. So, overall our food has been consisted over the years. \\n\\nI've seen a number of bad reviews about service and wait times. Honestly, the fact that we usually visit during non-peak hours must really help because our service has always been attentive and we never have to wait. I guess if you are visiting during an event in Atlantic Station or Friday/Saturday night when most people are out in the city...be prepared for long waits and possibly slow service. However, if you can visit during a less busy time, I'm sure that may help with the overall experience of this restaurant.

We ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and by the time she walked by our table again so we could ask for some butter (cause it doesn't come with butter) the crawfish was halfway gone. I also ordered a shrimp po boy and boudin balls. It was a good 45 mins before we received our po boy and boudin balls after we had already finished our crawfish. She just said the kitchen was backed up and apologized for the kitchen. No, that does not explain YOUR bad service in not checking on us at all and ignoring us. Thanks to her will not be back. The whopping $9.45/lb crawfish price when it's IN SEASON is also a huge turn off. I'm sorry, but I'm originally from Houston and when crawfish is in season there it's $4.99/lb-$5.99/lb. I'll just get my fix when I go back to visit htown. As far as the taste, crawfish had no flavor and we asked for spicy. Definitely not spicy at all.

It had generally good reviews on Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google, and there was a 100-minute wait on Saturday night, so when we went back on Sunday we were happy to find only a 30-minute wait for a table.\\n\\nThe restaurant texted us about 25 minutes later, and in we went. While I normally would want to visit more than once to review a place, we will absolutely never return to this restaurant.\\n\\nPositives:\\nAtmosphere\\nDecor\\nChips + salsa\\n\\nNegatives:\\nThe wait - so not worth it\\nGuacamole\\nChicken tortilla soup\\nShrimp tacos\\nFood sitting out under heat lamps for a looooooong time\\n\\nThe atmosphere and decor are terrific - and unfortunately were by far the best part of our dinner. Well, that and the chips that were served with a decently spicy and tasty red salsa (they were out of the green, our waiter informed us). Our waiter kept replacing the basket with a new, full one - absolutely the best part of dinner.\\n\\nThe room is large, airy, and industrial, with an open kitchen, an entrance to the Market out back, a semi-private room next to the kitchen, and lots of cool decorations all around. Good music played throughout the evening, and while it was loud it wasn't ridiculous.\\n\\nIt took a long time for our waiter to take our order. And a long time for the food to come. While we waited, we noted the rows and rows of plates full of food from the kitchen sitting under the heat lamps waiting for servers to come get them. Based on the pace of the meal and the attentiveness of our waiter, it's possible that the wait staff was out back getting high, which is why so many plates were left to dry out under the heat lamps for so long. The staff was definitely  not doing coke - nothing was rushed, or even quick.\\n\\nBut back to our dinner. My wife ordered the chicken tortilla soup, expecting the familiar thin broth flavored with tomato, with chunks of chicken and tortilla strips. Instead, the soup was thick and hearty and heavily adobo chili-flavored with ground chicken, very salty, and not at all what we were expecting. Not terrible, but also not great. We each had a couple spoonfuls and put it to the side. (To his credit, our waiter removed the soup from our bill when we told him why we weren't having it.)\\n\\nWe ordered guacamole to share. It came with rather flavorless, puffier chips, and the guacamole itself was pretty much mashed avocado scooped onto a plate - there was no real flavor, and while it could be described by many words, \\"guacamole\\" is not one of them. A huge disappointment.\\n\\nMy wife had the tacos camarones; I had the tacos al carbon. (When I ordered them, the waiter asked me if I wanted chicken, pork, or steak. Since the menu described these as \\"grilled steak\\" tacos, I was a little worried.)\\n\\nMy wife's tacos came with cold shrimp topped with warmed slaw in a warm soft taco - they had clearly been sitting under the heat lamps for a while. They were okay. My steak tacos came rolled in warm flour tortillas (each of us got 3 tacos). The steak was warm but not hot. The flavoring was pretty good, but the steak tacos I get at \\"Taco Today\\" in New York, $1.89/taco, are significantly better (if smaller).\\n\\nThe beans and rice came a few minutes later. The beans, with some cheese melted on top, had a nice crust from the heat lamps. The rice was mostly salted, although there was also some kind of flavoring that wasn't very good. We left most of that over as well.\\n\\nI have no idea why this restaurant is so popular. Maybe there's no good Tex-Mex in Atlanta and it shines by comparison.

Who gives their customers xo sauce for Japanese shabu shabu like really?!?! This isn't chinese hot pot. The meat was chewy like rubber band and had no beef flavor. If you are charging $25+ per person you better have some quality. Not expecting Kobe beef type quality but at least something edible. We had one round of \\"shabu shabu\\" and had to call it quits. After shabu shabu I was fuming and wanted to go to McDonalds to cure my hunger but my girlfriend said lets just try their korean BBQ. So we ordered the marinated beef and marinated short ribs.

What was wrong with me?  The spicy omelette banh mi trung, where have you been all my life?  Oh the savory and minty crispy crunch.  This is a sandwich I want to make love to for the rest of my life.  The Pho Bo was excellent too.  A deep flavorful broth and lots of braised beef shank.  The pickled spice sauce was the bomb in more ways than one.\\n\\nThey also have lots of other more expensive dishes, but we went with the cheaper ones.  The food was so good, I want to cry.  Don't go during rush hours.  Service is good although sometimes passive aggressive, but that just makes it feel more French.  \\n\\nThere are lots of Vietnamese restaurants that serve Chinese-Vietnamese food.  Several French restos that serve French cuisine.  This is one of the few that serve Vietnamese-inspired, French-influenced cooking.  I'm sure people will go and have their expectations set too high, and feel like it is just OK cooking.  I went in not expecting anything special, because, for example, how could pho be any different?  Or banh mi?  But somehow I was blown away by the simple combinations of deeply satisfying flavors.  The spicy omelette sandwich has a standard asian style omelette which my mom made for me many times growing up.  It never occurred to me to use it for the base of a sandwich, add spicy pork sauce, mint, cilantro, butter, and a crispy baguette to it.  Combined, it turns out to be sublime and an absolute revelation.

During our last trip we waited about 20 minutes past our reservation time before we were seated but this time they did a much better job getting us seated close to when we had reservations. \\n\\nThe pretzel bread was there in the bread basket like I knew it would be - spread with that maple salt-topped butter and I was in carb heaven. We decided to share poutine and went with the house style topped with a red wine reduction as recommended by our server. It was probably the best poutine I've tasted - the cheese was super melty and the red wine reduction really cinched it. Fun side note: in NYC poutine is usually called disco fries and our server seemed amused I called them that :D \\n\\nFor my main I had the NY strip, topped with an intact roasted onion and a herb popover. The steak was good, though I was a little puzzled that it was served to me already cut (I remember it being intact my last trip, and other steakhouses in Disney World keep it intact as well). Nevertheless it was tasty and the popover was a unique touch. For dessert I had the lemon curd tart.

Come to Lyndell's. \\n\\nI've lived in Ball Square for a few years and have visited Lyndell's on numerous occasions. On those grounds, I was ready to give them a negative review. Why? Because I always ordered the wrong things. When I go to a bakery, I go in for the pastries and breads. I automatically order the items with golden, flaky crusts and sweet innards, and every pastry I ordered from Lyndell's was dry, dense, and way too sweet. After a while, I decided to try their cookies, which were similarly disappointing. Eventually, I decided that Lyndell's was beloved mostly for its atmosphere: \\"we're the neighborhood Italian bakery that hasn't updated anything since 1965. We're here, we're authentic, and we don't need you.\\" Townies and hipsters eat that up, which explains why Lyndell's is such a hit in Ball Square. As someone with zero nostalgia for the non-existent Italian bakeries of their childhood, I was ready to dismiss Lyndell's entirely.\\n\\nThen someone told me I was doing it wrong. All the Yelp reviews confirmed that. Before I could review Lyndell's Bakery in good conscience, I had to try one of their cupcakes. So I did. And it was perfect. West Somerville is teeming with shops and bakeries ready to serve you an awful cupcake, and Lyndell's is the antidote to those poseurs. The cupcakes are completely without frills: soft, moist cake topped with rich, creamy frosting. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. That's all you need - and if that's less than you want, then you don't understand cupcakes.\\n\\nIf you go to Lyndell's, order one of the cakey items. Half-moons, cupcakes, full cakes, whatever: if it's a cake-like substance, you're in good shape. Everything else? Don't even bother. For this reason, I'm only giving Lyndell's three stars - they fail as a complete bakery, but they succeed as a bad bakery with one amazing specialty."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"100 Cambridgeside Pl","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"The Cheesecake Factory has good food, not great food, and they charge more than they should  for just good food.

We were seated a few minutes before 9. \\n\\nThe booths were disgusting, and we were handed sticky menus covered in grime. Our waiter, Jamie, was cheerful and we did our best to be upbeat, but the entire experience continued to deteriorate. \\n\\nWe received waters around 9:15, and our drinks took another 15 minutes... and we were told to have our dessert order ready when we ordered dinner because they were running 20 minutes behind.

It was unrecognizable as food cooked in a kitchen and was presumably microwaved. \\n\\nThere was a mushy, overcooked pasta with sauce beginning to plasticize (this was the \\"shrimp and crab mac & cheese\\") that looked similar to the quality of a boxed, processed macaroni. \\n\\nThe chicken was about what you'd find at a fast food restaurant, having been mass produced complete with fake sear marks. This was accompanied by \\"mashed\\" potatoes, which consisted of an entire half potato which was barely penetrable with a fork. \\n\\nKid's pasta: about 10 noodles with a pathetic jar sauce. \\n\\nWe finally hit our limit and complained. Not only did the staff seem anemic about the issues, they seemed unsurprised. While the majority of the meal was comped with the exception of our bottle of wine, desserts (which we asked still be delivered for the kids despite sending our food back) and gratuity, there is no making up for the nearly three hours wasted here and ending the night without eating. We were literally starving, but the food was so disgusting and the experience so bad w had all lost our appetites. \\n\\nThe much hyped desserts are things like vanilla ice cream fancied up with straws and whipped cream along with a food service chocolate pie also covered up to look like something impressive but ultimately mediocre at best. We didn't bother. \\n\\nWhile we waited for resolution, we watched nearby tables get sloppily bussed with the food just wiped around on the surface - no form of actually disinfecting or cleaning. \\n\\nWe did not and do not want any form of apology or anything else... we just don't want other families to have this level of expectation and disappointment... especially at these price points. \\n\\nEvidently plenty of people eat here and think it's amazing, but it's just a really embarrassing, tourist trap facade of a restaurant with extremely high profit margins. \\n\\nDisgusting, sad and really disappointing end to our trip."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"You literally have to shove your way to the counter!

The bad news, it was in the side room, which was nasty-hot.  \\n\\nWe ordered wings and nachos.  The wings were good, but they charged me $1.38 for watery ranch and $0.69 for celery.  Seriously?  Lame.  The nachos were served with a tube of sour cream, and were piled so high on their tiny plate that the first several we pulled were all lettuce.  By the time we got down to the cheese and chili the cheese had cooled and started to solidify and the chips were a soggy mess.  Not a pretty picture.  \\n\\nI say 3 stars because the drinks were cheap and the bartender and waitress were very nice, and if you can get a table in the main dining room you might not have to worry about passing out from the heat, but overall we'll probably be looking for somewhere else to watch the game next weekend."},{"name":"Petsi Pies","address":"285 Beacon St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"The smells coming out of this place in the morning are amazing.

The one comment I'd make is that the food seemed to take a lot longer to arrive than I'd expect.

There were many hot options (maybe about 12), salad, fruit and a dessert item along with a crock of soup.\\n\\nWe started right with the \\"hot\\" options taking a little of everything to try.  Each item was labeled with a sign on top of the \\"bar\\" but by the time we returned to our table with our plates, we had forgotten what each items was (with the exception of a few).   My favorites were the fish curry and the creamed spinach & chicken.  All of the chicken dishes were VERY tender.  The only downside was everything was warm but not hot.   The other Indian buffet we tried had each option in a separate cauldron with a direct heat source underneath which kept everything very hot.   We thought the dishes were good but not as flavorful as the other buffet. \\n\\nOur server who was also the young lady who showed us to our table was very helpful and friendly.   My friend almost lost her taste buds when she ate something incredibly hot in the vegetable mixture that accompanied the chicken kabobs.

Until tonight, we had missed out on one of the very best places to eat in the area, especially if you like fine Italian cuisine.\\n\\nWhat a treat. Everything was obviously fresh, made from high quality products, and very tasty. Our waiter, who told us that he had also designed the wine menu, was knowledgeable and friendly. He guided us in choosing the tartare as a starter. He assured us that this was easily the best tartare in Vancouver. I happen to eat tartare steak almost anywhere it is offered and know a thing or two about tartare. We also ordered the charcuterie platter to make sure we would give this place a full opportunity to seduce (or fail) us. \\n\\nThe tartare was the very best tartare I have ever had. A good tartare usually rests on the choice of meat and the cut (blended mechanically vs cut with a knife). Here, although the dish looked humble, I was in for one of the greatest culinary surprises I have ever had. The tartare's yolk was elegantly spread in the shape of 5 or 6 small drops on top of it. I suspect that more egg yolk, as well as a blend of spices, herbs, oil and maybe a note of some acidific fruit was involved in elevating a very fine cut of meat to an incredible level of refined deliciousness. Texture was rich and the meat sort of melted in your mouth, like a piece of marbled sushi sashimi might. I made a special effort to eat it as slowly as possible, enjoying a sip here and there of the excellent wine recommended by the knowledgeable waiter between every bite. If you go there, and they have it (I took the last order available on that night) do not miss it! \\n\\nThe charcuterie platter was obviously more predictable in terms of its appearance, but the quality of the meats and cheeses was excellent. The mustard and fig puree accompaniments were wonderful. \\n\\nTurning to the main course, I had the lobster ravioli. Once again, quality spoke for itself. Once again, the chef's genius for balancing flavours, acidity and textures was obvious. Dollar per dollar, this is easily the most refined Italian restaurant in the area, and not the most expensive. You have no excuse not to pay it a visit if you front almost twice as much money to eat at some of the more expensive Italian restaurants on 4th.\\n\\nWhat else is there to say? Perhaps the place looks a tiny bit old school or not very trendy. The food though, is subtly bleeding edge (not gimmicky but undeniably innovative) and reasonably priced when taking into account product quality. In short, absolutely solid. \\n\\nI would go there again anytime I want GREAT Italian food. Solid, solid address built up by very knowledgeable people when it comes to food (and maybe a bit less about interior decoration)."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I LOVE DOWNTOWN DISNEY!!!

I had read so many comments that called it \\"small and dark\\", that it sure was bigger and brighter than I expected.  Had no problem reading the menu.  BIG problem narrowing down the awesome-sounding choices though.\\n\\n  Service was excellent from beginning to end.  Husband had iced tea and the Whiskey Flight (for under nine bucks...a DEAL!).  I had to try the Martini flight (think it was $16).  Not as much of a deal, imho.  These glasses were pretty small (a couple swallows each), and all three were sweet.  Would have been nice to have a dry one in the middle.  There was the blue glow-tini, which was good and refreshing, but teeny tiny.  The second one was a Toronto (or something like that), a couple sips of something completely unmemorable.  The last was a chocolate martini that I saved til after the meal. A couple sips of sweet goodness, with a little tasty chocolate twirl.\\n\\n  You've all heard about their delicious pretzel bread (it's true), and the slightly sweet/salty topping on the butter really puts it over the top.\\n\\n  For my entree I chose \\"Golden Tilefish: Prosciutto, Pork Belly Tortellini, Arugula, Roasted Tomato Fume, Cauliflower Gremolata.  It was a thick meaty piece of fish wrapped in thin prosciutto.  Needed a knife to cut through the prosciutto. This was rich and delicious...very filling!  Loved the Gremolata, and would have liked more on it.  The sauce was very rich and buttery.\\n\\n  Meanwhile Husband was moaning and groaning with glee over his Canadian Beef Tenderloin, Wild Mushroom Risotto, Pearl Onions, and White-Truffle Butter Sauce.  Proclaimed it the best Filet he's ever eaten!  Probably the most expensive also, but thanks to \\"free\\" dining we didn't have to pay that $46!    \\n\\n   Also thanks to free dining, we shared: Citrus Olive Oil Cake\\nVanilla-Mint Panna Cotta, Berry Gel√©e, Chili Pepper Sorbet, Sesame Tuile\\n 10.00\\n\\n   This was light and when you combined everything into one bite, was especially extraordinary.

The restaurant was only about half full so it was confusing why they would discourage anyone from coming in. It seemed they were a tad overwhelmed by the amount of dinners, it often felt understaffed and it took about a half hour for our first course. They need more staff! The two ladies rocked it out last night but the slow start was a tad discouraging. The food and the charming chef offset any issues I have about it.

What we thought was going to be a great experience turned into a joke. We called ahead and made a reservation at 5:00pm since we had a large party. We walked in early and were kindly greeted. We waited in the lounge for our table to be ready at 5. We were seated right on time along with 2 other tables of two. We sat down and I immediately ordered my two young children's meals since they don't have the patience lol. We ordered our appetizers and meal at the same time about 15 min after the kids food. The restaurant filled up at this point. The kids food came out quickly and my kids really enjoyed the food. 45 min in we still didn't have our appetizers and my kids were completely done with their food. About 50 mins in our appetizers finally came out and I noticed along with my entire party that alllllll the other tables in the restaurant had received their entrees before us getting our appetizers. At this point my kids were done and ready and I was upset. We asked to talk to a manager and then were told that the reason the large party behind us got their food before us was because they needed their table and put a rush on their food. I was not happy and was told by the GM that he would make it right. I left without eating my food to get my kids out of the restaurant so they wouldn't cause havoc . My family later joined me and the GM sent my family on their way making us pay part of the bill blaming my husband for not requesting the entire bill to be comped. I had to call the GM after we left to let him know I was not happy and that I felt like we were not taken care of like we were promised and then blamed for not asking for it.

His parents drove from Texas and have already committed to visiting next year... as long as we can dine at Ray's! \\n\\nHere's why Ray's is better than other Thanksgiving buffets:\\n1. Gorgeous setting right by the river\\n2. Classy ambiance\\n3. Professional staff\\n4. Delicious food - and lots of it. There were delicious breakfast items (especially the grits), and high-dollar items like eggs benedict and salmon, sweet stuffed crepes, etc. They had a full non-Thanksgiving spread of items like a well stocked salad bar, fish and other seafood, vegetables, bread items, pasta, etc. THEN the Thanksgiving spread was to die for - delicious, moist turkey, real cranberry sauce, several mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, and the most delicious mashed sweet potatoes I've ever had - marshmallows, pecans, the works. They also had a great dessert bar- banana pudding, red velvet cupcakes, lemon bars, pies, brownies, etc. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Ray's, if you read this, please consider adding those delicious sweet potatoes to the menu year round. I would eat a giant plate of them every day. \\n5. Amazing bottomless mimosa deal. $12 a person for truly bottomless mimosas. I hate bottomless mimosa \\"deals\\" when you can never get a refill. That was definitely not the case at Ray's. They provided us with generous pours to begin with, and then even left a pitcher on the table so we could fill up ourselves. \\n6. Nicely organized valet. \\n7. Quality of the food- The food deserves another bullet point here for quality. Everything we ate was cooked perfectly and it was obvious that all of the items were top-quality. They didn't shortchange quality for quantity. The food quality is the reason we will be returning next year. \\n\\nI love Thanksgiving buffets. No one gets saddled with the cooking or clean up duties, so you can truly enjoy the company of your family and friends. We had a great time. \\n\\nIt might be a fun marketing idea to allow people to $20 for a to-go container.... I was too full to enjoy dessert and would have loved some for later."},{"name":"Doc's Motorworks","address":"1123 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I was told to try the burgers and so I did.

I guess maybe they have to account for them at the end of the shift or something, cause they will not budge or fall for the I left the coupons at home excuse either.\\n\\nOverall, its better than the Wendys, Checker and Burger King that all sit next to or across from this location, and at least you know that you food hasnt been sitting under a heat lamp for hours."},{"name":"Dalina","address":"687 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place to grab some coffee and a light breakfast and sit outside and watch the folks walk by.

Most people dress up, making it above casual. Not semi-formal, but think downtown fashion. There are a few minor cons like if you don't make it by 9:10pm, you will not find a table. Barely even find places to sit since happy hour is only the patio area and a few tables beside the bar. Parking is also hard to find.

I refuse to give money to a restaurant with such dishonest business practices. This is an opinion I have formed after 3 consecutively poor experiences with this restaurant. For those who want a brief overview, here it is. Otherwise, I have included a detailed review of my three experiences. \\n\\nSummary: Not only is service mind numbingly slow, this restaurant has now begun charging higher prices than what is listed on their menus. This means that you will sit down at your table and order the $7 pad thai, but they will charge you $9 without notifying you. If you order the Nabeyaki Udon Soup, make sure it comes with the tempura shrimp the menu states it's supposed to come with bc I've ordered it twice and it didn't. I've only recently realized it was supposed to come with the shrimp, so I didn't say anything previously.  \\n\\nDetailed Version:\\n\\nFirst visit: Ordered Nabeyaki Udon soup and Spicy Beef Tofu Soup for pick up. Paid $8 and $8 respectively. All seemed ok until I realized tonight that the Nabeyaki Udon is supposed to come with shrimp tempura, and mine never did.\\n\\nSecond visit: Ordered Nabeyaki Udon and Spicy Beef Tofu Soup for delivery for $8 each plus a $2 delivery fee. After an 1.5 hours of no delivery, I call back, and they tell me they lost the order. I replace the order and tack on an order of pad thai since at that point my bf and I were starving. No service recovery, nothing. I had to ASK to not pay the delivery fee after the ordeal; they didn't offer it. They did tell me that they will expedite the delivery, yet it still took over an hour to get it delivered from the restaurant that is less than a mile away. Still no shrimp tempura in the Nabeyaki Udon. At the time, I was still unaware it was supposed to come with it. Although dissatisfied with the poor delivery service and lack of action afterwards, I still decided to give them another shot. \\n\\nThird visit: \\nI ordered Spicy Beef Tofu Soup, Tofu Pad Thai, 2 avocado-cucumber rolls (hold the cucumber), and 1 salmon roll for pick up. The takeout menu prices stated $8 for the soup, $7 for the pad thai, and $2 each for the sushi rolls added to a meal to make it a combo. I arrived at the restaurant, and they wanted to charge $6 for a crunchy salmon roll and $3 each for the avocado rolls. I didn't see the prices for the soup or Pad Thai so I didn't address that. When questioned, they stated they increased prices for the Avocado Roll and that they didn't have a Salmon Roll, so they made and charged for a Crunchy Salmon Roll. I told them I didn't want the Crunchy Salmon Roll and then my boyfriend and I sat down and waited for them to fix the order. \\n\\nWhile we waited, we picked up a menu and realized that the menu still reflects the $2 roll prices, including lo and behold, a plain salmon roll. After 20 minutes of waiting, they finally arrived with my updated order. I asked if we can order the $2 rolls that are on their menu, and she told me again that they raised their prices but that their menus weren't updated. I told her she can't charge higher prices if they weren't reflected on the menu, and she reluctantly agrees to honor the menu prices bc she doesn't want to argue, never once accepting fault at charging inconsistent prices. I gave my bf my credit card and decided to wait in the car bc I was frustrated and didn't want to make a scene. \\n\\nFast forward to my bf returning with the food. I look at the receipt and find that they charged $27 for a meal that should have cost $21 plus tax. She didn't even give my bf an itemized receipt bc she probably didn't want to show him how much she charged for each item. From looking at the original itemized receipt with the inflated prices, I assume they charged the higher prices for both the Pad Thai (should have been $7 but now $9) and Spicy Beef Tofu Soup ($8 but now $8.50) and then perhaps honored the $2 sushi prices. However, after further investigation, even if they honored the $2 prices for each sushi roll, there is still a $2 price discrepancy even after accounting for tax. At that point, I was livid but too tired to go back into the restaurant. \\n\\nI am home now, and as if the restaurant couldn't do any worse, I open my food and find chicken in my \\"tofu\\" pad thai, and cucumber in my avocado-no-cucumber roll. I give up. I am done with this restaurant, and I am looking into reporting them to the Better Business Bureau."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"My daughter goes here a lot, this was my 1st experience.

The feel is great...the shutters, the fountain, the faux walls, the dishes (cool oblong white dishes-classy), unique wine glasses, and the Italian music overhead made me yearn for Tuscany.\\n\\nService: Almost overkill. Four young ladies clamoring for the next customer...saying that, the service was great. My wife and I are vegetarians and we asked our server if the dishes were made with chicken stock etc...she double checked with the chef and assured us that the dishes were safe. My diet coke (I always get wine...just one of those days for me) was refilled twice without being asked, the server was attentive with everything. A pleasant service experience considering how new the establishment is and how young are server was.\\n\\nWine: Not a bad selection for a small bistro setting. Nice to see a variety that focuses on Italian varietals! \\n\\nThe Food: We ordered the house salad (simple it was: but flavorful with just enough dressing and fresh ingredients) and the Insalata Caprese. The fresh buffalo mozzarella was to die for! A great start to our meal. Like the previous reviewer said, the bread was just a bit too pedestrian for me. I ordered a baked mushroom rigatoni and my wife tried the Spaghetti with marinara sauce. My baked dish was delicious! The mushroom and cheese blended well together...I ate the entire dish! My wife's spaghetti was bland, a bit watery and could have used a touch of heat. But...her pasta was fresh and she commented later in the evening \\"I don't feel stuff like I usually do after eating pasta\\". My assumption is that the chef is cognizant of the \\"lighter style\\" spaghetti they serve...which in case might be a good thing for some.\\n\\nDessert: Wonderful~ I have forgotten the name of this chocolate, whip creamed, raspberry concoction but it was tasty. Not too heavy and definitely sharable! \\n\\nGive Uptown Pasta a chance.

I don't know if this is a good thing, or a bad thing, but the (very friendly) wait staff know to bring us 2 large margaritas, on the rocks, no salt, and a Philip's Special (very nice queso with all the trimmings) along with the obligatory complimentary water, and chips and salsa. I suppose it's a good thing... at least while my liver is still functional. ;)\\n\\nI'm not sure why the food here doesn't get more love, because there is some quite good food served here. If you want some flavor, I'm very partial to the Tacos Al Pastor (pork and pineapple), BBQ Tacos, or my favorite Prescado A La Chef (I'm not sure if that should be 'Pescado', but that's what the menu says!). The fajita meat is also nice and tender, for those that like something with a little \\"sizzle\\".\\n\\nPortion size is big, and they're usually pretty good about substituting things. For example, I usually prefer to have black beans instead of charra beans, or often I'll have an entree with two different stuff from separate entrees (YMMV).\\n\\nThe decor inside is pretty funky, and colorful and I've also noticed that whoever controls the background music likes the 80s... so if you haven't any Kajagoogoo in a while, this may well be the place for you.  They also have a couple of strategically placed TVs, so if you've been dragged there and are afraid of missing the game, they'll either have it on, or if you ask nicely, they'll most likely turn it over for you.\\n\\nParking tip : If you drive by and the parking lot looks full, you can park next door on both sides (outside business hours, of course).\\n\\nFriday nights is the busiest time, but the most we've ever had to wait for a table is 10 minutes, and usually you'll be seated immediately.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you're like us, and want a friendly atmosphere which serves a great margarita (none of that sickly sweet stuff I keep on getting elsewhere), and some decent food, then head \\"Mid-Town\\" to El Mercado and let Salvador, Edgar, Nancy, Ryan, et al take care of you!

You should question people who don't love pizza. So, I am always up for trying a new pizza place, especially one that has been getting fantastic reviews.\\n\\nPizza Bruno is in kind of a weird area of town. It's on Curry Ford and not far from Semoran. It's in a small shopping plaza and might be easy to miss from the road to some. Inside is a wonderful palace of pizza and delights. The interior is kind of small, but the extra high ceiling takes away the feeling of smallness. The decor is modern (this wouldn't look out of place on Mills) and the walls are covered with pictures drawn by children which I thought was cute.\\n\\nPizza Bruno doesn't mess around. Pizza is their specialty and their menu reflects that. There are some appetizers, salads, and desserts, but the main focus is pizza. But before I get to the pizza, I have to mention that the garlic knots here are on point and might be some of the best garlic knots I've had. They're huge, they're smothered in garlic, and I almost feel bad eating them because they're so beautiful. Also, you can get some meatballs as appetizers, and if you're a meatball enthusiast like me, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nMy party ordered three pizzas and we all sampled each one. We ordered the Classic Original, the Ninety Two (chili flake / oregano /red onion / Kalamata olives / roasted red peppers / mushrooms / Berkshire Italian sausage / Pecorino / Fresh Mozzarella), and the Crimson Ghost (Calabrian chilies / Soppressata / fresh mozzarella / Basil / hot honey). All three were delicious; perfect blend of cheese, sauce, toppings, and crust. All of their pizzas are 12\\", so they're good for splitting up among friends.

The facility is awesome and the staff greet you right away and are friendly and at $30/hr it's one of the more reasonably priced activities in Orlando that is worth checking out .\\nWe decided to have lunch in their restaurant and could see everyone from the 2nd floor deck and it was a nice form of entertainment. Dad had a burger and I had guac and chips/salsa .  I was actually hungrier but the server was so fast with great customer service  I didn't have time to get past the apps and my dad was hungry so I just ordered an app .  I let her know I would be ordering later possibly.  Possibly because sometimes the apps are pretty big and filling. As this was our first time I didn't know.\\nDads burger was awesome. He pretty much ate the whole thing. My guac is made fresh and I know this because there was a fairly large piece of avacado peel lodged in my guac.  That's pretty bad but since it was not ingested so I was not that upset. But I did bring it to the attention of our server. She said she would tell the manager and would let the kitchen know.  At this point I'm not sure if that even happened because nobody came to our table, nobody offered to replace the item in question (not the whole thing but maybe just the guac part) and nothing taken off the bill.  Not that these things are expected but in the food service industry, at the very least one of those things should have happened.  So either the server didn't really tell the manager , or she did and he/she was not concerned with a table touch to acknowledge the issue. And I pretty much stopped eating my food after that. The server did not comment or ask why the guac was pretty much enjoyed for only two bites. And nope I never ordered anything else even though I wanted to. \\nA five for the facility and a three star for this experience in the restaurant.

I'm sure the owners would love to pad a bill that way.  The food took 30 minutes to arrive...believe me it wasn't worth waiting for.  I ordered the scallop and shrimp pasta that was very bland.  There was no seasoning at all.  Has the chef even heard of salt and pepper?

This happens often, and I often feel defeated by my willpower to only order 4 and then managing to devour all 6. I could eat a billion. They remind me of the cake donuts my grandmother used to make on special occasions, and makes me feel nostalgic.\\n\\nI've also had their chai, the bootstrap is my fave so far. I tried the Emmy Lou, which was nice, but overly sweet in my opinion. I'm excited to try the other two on the menu. \\n\\nThe staff is pretty incredible. Almost every single person is over the top friendly. I love it! So few places in Portland serving great coffee have smiling baristas that will chat with you. I was crabby the first time I came in.

They offer a variety of drinks, as well as bagged teas and accessories to take home, and a small selection of cakes, pies, and other treats. I don't know if they make their own pies (I assume they do for the sign on their shop says \\"home made gourmet pie\\"), but their cakes are the same as the ones you get from Stuart's Bakery (and I'd recommend you getting it from Stuart's instead, as they are a bit cheaper). I've tried their Banana Chocolate Cream Pie and Turkey Pot Pie (as well as Red Velvet Cake and Carrot Cake from Stuart's Bakery). I quite enjoyed the pies, and while the prices are a bit higher (I think they're around $9-$10 a slice, the portions that I got were quite large, so it wasn't too bad of a deal. Although I haven't tried any of their drinks, I did enjoy my visit; this is a place worth stopping by for some drinks and treats.\\n\\nBanana Chocolate Cream Pie (around $9):\\n3.5/5\\nThis was filled with bananas and topped with whipping cream. I really enjoyed the crust, which was coated with chocolate, and was quite flaky. The bananas were creamy and mildly sweet. I did find the whipped cream to be a bit stiff and bland.\\n\\nTurkey Pot Pie (around $9):\\n3.5/5\\nThis contained turkey, stuffing, cranberries. The filling had a great blend between savoury and sweet/tart from the cranberries. The turkey was just a tad on the dry side, but not overly so, and was well-seasoned and flavourful; I did find the ginger pieces to be a bit too large and sharp/astringent. The crust was quite flakey and had a nice flavour without being overly burnt. Portion-wise, the slice was generous, probably 1.5x the size of what you'd normally expect.\\n\\nRed Velvet Cake ($6.25):\\nN/A (4/5)\\nThis was from Stuart's Bakery. The cake was dense, but moist and tender. The cream cheese frosting was creamy and sweet, with a nice bit of tang. It was nice, but you can get the same thing from the source for a bit cheaper.\\n\\nCarrot Cake ($6.25):\\nN/A (4/5)\\nThis was also from Stuart's Bakery. The cake was very moist and tender, and contained raisins, while the cream cheese frosting was creamy and sweet. I could have done with a bit more tang however. Again, this was tasty, but you can get the same thing from the source for a bit cheaper.\\n\\nSummary:\\nFood: 3.5/5\\nPrice: 3.5/5\\nService: N/A\\nOverall: 3.5/5\\nRecommendations: Pies"},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Had to alligator boudin balls and the worlds famous po-boy.

They even told us about some of the drinks they've had requested, one tasting like an Andes Mint. It felt like we were treated like regulars, which was enjoyable. We were also treated with a milkshake made by the manager, Kim. She was very accommodating with our need for a milkshake with peanut butter and chocolate, and it was a damn good shake.\\nWe ordered fettuccine alfredo, shrimp and crab mac and cheese, the mushroom risotto, and some sort of burger (which my boyfriend cannot remember which one he got) were pretty good (this was also a span of two visits we we are not that gluttonous).

The quality of the food has fallen dramatically, and even though their website states that they deliver, they do not.  As someone who was happy to pay $50+ for some great pizza and italian dishes (including their $5 delivery fee), it's annoying that they don't anymore when their website says otherwise.

It is understandable for high-end restaurants to have a dress-code, however, letting your guests know ahead of time is key. Upon making my reservation at Ray's earlier that day the hostess never let us know that this restaurant had a dress-code. Upon arrival the hostess told us to sit down and she would get us seated shortly. We waited approximately 10 minutes only for her to tell us that one member of our party was not wearing the correct attire. Rather than letting this slide just once, as most upscale restaurants with good customer service do, they decided to inform us that their dress code policy was on their website and they would be more than happy to seat our party of 4 outside (it was approximately 95 degrees that day) or by the bar area. When we asked if there was any way they could let this go as, again, the rest of the party was dressed more than appropriately, they said that if they let one person in with ripped jeans it would create a \\"waterfall effect\\" on the rest of the crowd. \\n\\nWe passed on Ray's for the night, as the interaction put a bad taste in our mouth and the hostesses did a great job of making us feel very unwelcome. In the future if someone is not wearing the appropriate attire, keep in mind that they may want to come back. I hope this feedback helps management develop better practices for letting guests know about their dress code policy and spares other parties from this embarrassment in the future."},{"name":"Pho #1","address":"4051 Buford Hwy NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"3.5 stars.\\n\\nVery solid pho here.

Location/parking is always key for our venues and Hannibal's gets an A for their weekends-only back lot and some street parking; saw a valet stand, which they may use in the evenings.  It is also set in the quaint part of Winter Park's \\"Downtown\\" among the other outdoor/open window seating, which is perfect for warm weather lunch/dinners. Interior was classic and contemporary with large navy velvet couches - Love that idea with high back chairs too.  One side of the restaurant is the bar side and tucked in the corner was a baby grand piano. Classy.  I could see how this place would cater well to the evening guests.\\n\\nBeing visually pleased, I was looking forward to the meal.  Being a banquet-styled menu, I was really impressed with the choices and each one sounded amazing.  First choice was either a cream of mushroom soup or the French onion.  I picked the mushroom one of course.  Pretty good, but the portion I got was significantly smaller than the others.  The second course salad was nothing special since I don't really remember anything about it.  I opted for the snapper with a nice cream sauce, a side of rice and vegetables - no complaints there.  The best part was to come...so I thought.  I ordered the cr√®me brul√®, just salivating since it is one of my fav desserts with a black Nathan's coffee, too.  The portion of the brulee was more than the average ramekin.  Bonus!  However, mine was under cooked on top and the inside so it was more like a flan/egg pudding - bleh.\\n\\nThe server was particular rushed and short with us.  He didn't even get around to getting my coffee order or necessitate any of our table's requests.  We had to either get up to order/ask or pull another passing server, who were ten times more accommodating.   When coffee finally arrived, I was  ways finished with my \\"brulee\\" and on top of that, it was less than lukewarm.   I think they just microwaved my exist cup instead of replacing the coffee.

In this case, tried the fettucine alfredo (I couldn't find any chicken with prosciutto) and asked for chicken on the side. Very, very good. A couple bites of the pasta was a little hard for my taste, but I do like my pasta rather tender so it could've just been a matter of preference. Chicken was excellent, grilled and slightly blackened. Girlfriend ordered cheese tortellini which she thought was very good (and so did I).\\n\\nTips: They take reservations, and they have no cover outside the door so if the weather is rather wet, may want to take advantage of this. We went around 10 p.m. on a Friday night without a reservation, so we got lucky being able to go in and sit right away (literally, no more than 45 seconds after they greeted us, we were sat). For a first-time visit to Boston, I would definitely go back, if anything just to talk to Mike and enjoy his uber-friendly service."},{"name":"Grand Floridian Cafe","address":"4401 Floridian Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The lobster burger is a must.

(Flyer was also sitting on coffee table therefore I didn't even have to move from the couch, made decision of what to eat fairly easy) \\n\\nTook under 30 seconds to order. Lady said 45 min so we took off on a beer run. Delivery guy was there in 20 minutes, and this was during Sunday Night Football. Pretty impressive. He managed to get through my gate (?!) and called me from my front door. Poor guy had to wait as we dragged two puppies and two six packs at record pace up the hill to rush home. \\n\\nIn case it matters, I will mention that I'd already had at least a 6pack before chowing down (what? i like beer with my football). But this pizza was gooooood. Margarita pie is where it's at. Fold-in-half crust, lots of cheese, good sauce, fresh giant basil leaves and tomatoes. and garlic. LOTS of garlic. (Bonus: I added grilled chicken to half and it didn't cost a hundred dollars. See previous pizza place review.) We each polished off our half in about 5 minutes. My football/f-ck buddy claims to be a pizza snob but this kid actually requested the pizza box be moved four inches closer to him so he could get the next slice down his pie-hole that much faster. Hot. \\n\\nWill it be just as good when I'm sober? Who knows. Will likely have to wait 16 more Sundays to see."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"This was not great. 4 adults and 4 kids went for early bird hours at the Kissimmee location and none of us were wowed. I found the lobster to be very tough and chewy and they don't have claws, just the body. Crab legs were hard to get any meat out of them. Lobster bisque was just okay, very salty. Oysters Rockefeller and key lime pie and prime rib were probably my favorite tasting thing on the buffet. The seafood was just not great and this is a seafood place so you'd think it would be better. Tasted frozen then overcooked. Expensive for the quality... would have had a better meal elsewhere but this was at least entertaining for the 4 kids we had with us as they got to play with their food and engorge themselves at the buffet and eat all the desserts they wanted. The restrooms smelled like a dishwasher which was also a turnoff. Waitstaff was friendly and cleared plates efficiently."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],N={key:0},L={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,E)):w("",!0)])}const R=u(H,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-353991c1"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/1.md","filePath":"quotes/1.md"}'),G={name:"quotes/1.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(R)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
