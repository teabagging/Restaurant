Duck was so tender and juicy and paired perfectly with the sweetness of the grilled pears. I wish there were more duck pieces on the kebab.

The sauce has a bit of a kick to it but overall tasted great with the chicken. Very flavorful. \\n\\nPan-roasted soy glazed salmon -- wow! Salmon skin was so crispy and salty and the fish was perfectly tender and flaky. I loved the rice and veggies the salmon came with, particularly the cucumbers. This was one of the heartier dishes. \\n\\nMiso-glazed carrots: makes for a nice side with any of the meat/fish dishes.

The elevator had framed arts in different mediums, which was quite artsy. \\n\\nWhen we arrived the 9th floor. We quickly located our friends and placed our orders at the bar.

Then I figured I should give it s try since I was feeling pretty adventurous.\\n\\nI got the drink right away. It was coke with bourbon. It tasted good and strong, and that entertained me for a while. Then the food came; to my disappointment they looked small and cheap... Upon my first bite, I thought it was very Taco Bell like.

The Gurkha Pulau was advertised as one of those special Persian Rice's with saffron and other veggies, but I was disappointed to find barely any raisins in it. It's usually my favorite part of that style of rice. The salad was also quite underwhelming as there was barely any dressing on it to give the greens taste. The chicken however was quite good, and I finished wanting a bit more. There was an awkward piece of ginger laid on top of the chicken that I ended up not using though since it was too difficult to cut and mix it into my dish.\\n\\nThere doesn't seem like there are great restaurants in this area, so I'd say maybe try this restaurant out if your in the area.

After a few month absence (during which the restaurant was sold to new owners), we finally decided to revisit. MIIIIIIIISTAKE. The quality of food, menu options, bar and service have all taken a nosedive. The restaurant was not even half full, so my guess is the poor service and food is already catching up to them. I watched our food sit on the kitchen ledge for 15 minutes before it came to our table with half a dozen servers just standing around talking to each other. 40 minutes from the time we were seated, to the food actually being delivered to our table. Burgers and fries are not complicated - they just need to be served hot. Everyone's food at our table came out cold. We could have made a big deal out of it all, but why? So they could waste another 40 minutes getting me a new burger and fries? Sometimes you realize that it's just not worth making a big deal out of something because a place is too far gone.

It took the waiter a while to bring water. We tried a variety of dishes including the fried oysters, egg rolls, red rice, crab rice, collards, mac and cheese, and the muffins. I must say that the muffins and egg rolls were the best out of all the food. The crab rice did not have much of anything in it but rice. And the red rice was a bit dry like I've read from other reviewers. The mac and cheese was decent, and so were the greens but they were a bit salty. I was disappointed that after receiving the bill I was charged 18% gratuity for three people, and on top of that the waiter had to amend my check because he forgot to bring two other dishes that I ordered but didn't receive. We also tried a few alcoholic beverages- Uppity old-fashioned, and the Royal Flush they were delightful.

I've been there this year and once or twice in several recent years as well, and overall, my impression is that it's fine, but could be so much more.\\n\\nMany of the vendors are fairly typical things you might find at any farmer's market or street festival in Vancouver, but there are a few German/Central European inspired vendors, which help it feel distinctive. There's a K√§the Wohlfahrt shop that has a huge lineup, so go early. Honestly though, the decorations and the food are the bigger draw, at least for me. \\n\\nThere's a fair bit of food, much of it also Central or Eastern European. It's all quite good; special highlights for me this year were the l√°ngos and the poffertjes, though it's worth trying a bit of everything if you can. It's all fairly expensive, though the same could be said of a lot of street market food. (There's also boring stuff you can see at any street market, like hurricane potatoes, but it's mostly unique.)\\n\\nThe biggest problem with the market is the entry fee ($15 standard, though even the discounted rate of $8 feels high, and that's if you get in before 2:30pm or so, i.e. you can't get that price most days if you're a working adult with a job unless your job has very unusual hours), and the second biggest problem is that it's hidden in a corner of downtown that's otherwise not really near any shopping or eating or cultural activities, and only has one entrance and exit, which makes it feel both out-of-the-way to get to and kind of cramped once you're in.\\n\\nIn Germany, Christmas markets are a part of the fabric of the city - city squares are turned over to the markets, people encounter them as they move through the city naturally, and they're free to enter. The food and goods are expensive there too, but they're accessible, and the markets being central means there isn't a huge lineup to get in and a crowded cluster mess to get out - people just move through normally, if a bit more slowly.\\n\\nIf the Christmas market could reach some kind of funding agreement with the city or community organizations to remove the entry fee, I think the traffic their vendors would see would increase dramatically, especially if they could also find a more pedestrian-dense place to set up, like ≈°xnq Xwtl'e7√©n Square (the Art Gallery plaza), near Concord Pacific, Olympic Village, or anywhere people actually traverse in their daily life.\\n\\nAs it stands, it's hard to recommend paying the high price of entry. If you can get the discounted rate, preferably by arriving around opening time to avoid the crowds, it might be worth it if you really, really want to experience something with a bit of Central European flair; but otherwise it just leaves me missing how much more vibrant and interwoven into city life European Christmas markets are. I hope the market and the city are actively talking about strategies for improvement, which I've seen suggested by a few public figures; I think both businesses and the city could benefit from the market being brought out of its small monetized corner and into the public realm."},{"name":"Cypress Cove Nudist Resort","address":"4425 Pleasant Hill Rd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"+ As a community, it's a lovely place for the most part\\n- Office employees are rude, liars, bad communication w/other staff and patrons, cause confusion and issues\\n- Online checkout is junk, double charged my card and still haven't returned my $200, also placed an undisclosed $20 hold\\n- Front 'dog run' was a poop hole, nothing more\\n- Someone pooped in the pool and it had to be closed\\n\\nWe've been here a few times as guests and this past weekend for the Pink Rock event.

I asked where the concert would be held, she stated it was outdoors near the water, behind the office. Okay! Sounds good.\\n\\nGuy brought up that I should get specifics on their accommodations for ESA dogs, if any.\\n\\nSo, I say we have a PTSD ESA and ask if she would be allowed to accompany us into any buildings and whatnot. (Now, by law, ESA do not have the automatic accommodations of a service dog. However, some businesses and places still allow them to accompany their owners.) She puts me on hold to talk to the manager, coming back a few times to ask what the dog was for and what kind of dog she is. She is not a licensed support dog yet, she's an ESA. Saint Shepard. 'What's that? How big is that?' 55 lbs or so. Eventually she says the same thing I was previously told.

Still good. \\n\\nWRONG!\\n\\nWe get there around 4 PMish and check in. He's given tickets/directions/instructions.

(well, almost everyone. anyone with a small dog said stuff like, 'OH NO' and 'WATCH OUT' snatching their dogs up, which weren't leashed, and hiding them like Ellie was going to rip them apart)\\n\\nAnyway, we decide to check out the concert area and notice a small pink sign with the words 'NO DOGS ALLOWED' at the entrance. wut.\\n\\nThis led to a heated conversation in the office around 10 PM. It basically boiled down to 'you can either get a full refund right now or wait until the manager comes back in the morning'.  Would we still get a refund in the morning? \\"Yes.\\"\\n\\nBack in the office the next morning it boils down to 'she's not a real service dog, there's too many people there, why do you even need an ESA, there's no proof you need her, your documents don't count, oh by the way you're not getting a refund because you stayed the night'.  This 'Tiki' woman was crazy!\\n\\nWe asked TWICE and were told TWICE that she'd be allowed out there...once supposedly BY HER!  Her specifications as an ESA were made very clear and we never once misconstrued her as a seeing eye/seizure/whatever else dog that'd cause confusion.\\n\\nThe issue was the HORRIBLE communication, WRONG information (REPEATEDLY!), and absolute hostility towards us and our 'big scary dog'.\\n\\nHe opted to wait for the general manager to get up and speak with him. We went back to the campsite and while packing up were informed that we 'didn't need to wait' and would be allowed a full refund.

Ordered the classic shack burger, with fries and a black and white shake. Burger was tasty, beef was cooked well, and was seasoned well. Shake was pretty good, definitely being from a fast food chain. Fries, honestly not the biggest fan. Perhaps it is the crinkle cut, or perhaps they were just missing the flavor when compared to other burger places like In-n-Out burger or Five Guy's. If I were to go back, probably could pass on the fries and just get a burger and a shake. Overall, good, but that is about it, just good.

It reeks of trendy, hipster, douchebaggery.  I was surprised when I finally took my chance to step through the doors. Yes, it is trendy looking, yes there were some hipsters there, but surprisingly there was a fair amount of families and 'normal' folk there as well. \\"Huh, maybe this isn't what I was expecting,\\" I thought.\\n\\nI did find it weird that the guy assigned us a table number right as soon as we walked through the door, yet we still had to go to the counter to order the food. It's like a mix between fast causal and a sit-down place.  A little weird, but no biggie. When you walk to the back to order your food you are bombarded by the smell of the bread. Holy crap, the smell was very good. It did smell a bit more like a bakery that sells sweets rather than a burger place, and that had me worried. The staff was very friendly and took my order promptly.  I ordered the Llano Pablano burger. \\n\\nThe burger was large and very satisfying to eat. The veggies were fresh and tasty, the peppers were very flavorful, and the sauce was good. The problem is, the two main components of a good hamburger were all wrong for me. The MEAT, and the BREAD.  The meat was too dry and not all that flavorful (I had to taste it on it's own to confirm). The Bread was definitely a bit too sweet for my taste.  The whole time I was eating the burger I kept commenting how good all the other components were. Not once did I say \\"this is a delicious burger!\\"  It just reminded of a tarted up version of a Phil's Ice House burger.  I have a feeling I would get tired of the burgers here very quickly due to the sweet buns alone.  I did get fries as well and they were excellent, but Jeebus Christ they were expensive for what you get.  I got the regular for about $3 and it was a very small portion.  They were perfectly salted and nicely crisp though, so kudos on that front.\\n\\nNow I have a really stupid complaint here.  I know it's dumb, but I can't help mentioning it. Seriously it's stupid and I know it.  BUT... I ordered a St. Arnold's Fancy Lawnmower beer and it came in an obnoxiously large and heavy glass goblet.  Seriously, do I look like a Knight?  It's just a beer. Put it in a pint glass where it belongs. No need to try and make it fancy even though \\"Fancy\\" is in the name of the beer. \\n\\nAt the end of the meal I was very full, and I liked certain aspects of the food, hence the 3 star rating... BUT.... I do not see a future endeavor to South Congress where I say \\"I want Hopdoddy instead of Home Slice.\\"  That shit just isn't going to happen. \\n\\nPros: Friendly Staff, Great Veggies and Toppings, Good Beer Selection\\n\\nCons: Bus are Too Sweet, Meat Was a Bit Dry, Trendy Ambiance, Can I Just Have it in A Pint Glass Please?"},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Most of the highly-rated reviews I write are a result of many years of repeat visits, combining all snippets of evidence, and summarizing multiple experiences into one digest.\\n\\nNot so for this review of Maenam.

I was impressed with the variety of menu items and smoothie choices. This place had a drive through window and was fast casual. I got the veggie sandwich. The bread was thick and delicious. It was full of hummus, lettuce, peppers, alfalfa sprouts and was actually very filling. I was disappointed in the lack of vegetarian and vegan options. I feel that a place with the name \\"be fit\\" would have more of those options. They also did not have any gluten free bread. That being said, they listed all of their ingredients and the caloric breakdown, protein rams, etc. which was really nice! I normally roll my eyes when I see someone whine about the \\"vegan/ gluten free\\" thing, but I have recently hopped in the boat for an experiment. My fianc√© had the spicy tuna wrap which he said was awesome. My sandwich came with Tri colored chips and a side of salsa. It did not taste like fresh salsa to me, but what can I say, I willingly admit to having a soft spot for Tostitos salsa lol. I will take away one star for the service. There was a high school girl working who was 'friendly,' but seemed like she felt too good to be there in a weird way. She had this attitude about her and seemed to think it was odd that I was asking about all the vegetarian items etc. I even joked \\"I know it's annoying, etc.\\" We were just not greeted in a way that made me feel like we were welcomed.

When reviewing the sandwich, there was barely any turkey, stuffing, or cranberry sauce compared to the same sub from Randolph. \\n\\nThe Randolph shop makes the sub large enough to feed me for TWO meals if I am not feeling gluttonous. Not only that but they give me two heated gravy's to eat with my sub. The Avon sub was picked up by my father. Not only did they NOT give him 2 gravy's but didn't give him ANY! \\n\\nBy some EPIC hand of GOD'S GRACE my dad HAPPENED to look up at the menu and notice my sub was supposed to come with a gravy. He asked and received ONE. The gravy is usually watered down a bit with these subs, but you don't want a heavy gravy with such a sub. This one from Avon was more then 83% water. I calculated it in my underground lab. \\n\\nAnyway, I digress. The sub was small and squished, gravy too watered down, and you have to ask for the gravy even though it is clearly marked that it is to go with the sub.

Beer was fine and food tasted great but was way overpriced.\\n\\nService: 3/5\\nSat at the bar and got beers no problem: one hefeweizen and one dunkel, the two homebrew options available on tap. Second round, however, took way too long. We had to wave down a bartender as if we were stopping traffic. Waitstaff was nice but kinks are still getting worked out. The system for ordering food and drinks is problematic - you order at the bar or a counter/host stand for everything and either pay cash or run a tab. People were waiting in a super long line after a while, and the bartenders were running amok behind the bar. It looks unorganized. I felt sorry for the staff. Next time, I'll bring cash.\\n\\nFood: 3/5\\nOrdered the Kebapi (grilled mini-sausages) and the Weisswurst with Red Cabbage. Both tasted great, but the amount of food was a ripoff compared to the price. The Kebapi was two thin 2-inch sausages and a miniscule service of cabbage, delicious but child-sized portions for $5. Then the weisswurst: one mediocre sized sausage, side of sweet mustard (traditionally served with weisswurst), and about three bites worth of red cabbage...all for $16?!? I should have taken a pic. Everything tasted great, the sausage was plump and juicy with fresh veal/herb flavor, the mustard was tangy and sweet, and the cabbage was vinegary with good apple flavor. I was so angry at the amount of food for the price. NOT COOL. I didn't bitch to the staff since they were so busy by the time we finished the food. Flavor: 4/5, price: 2/5.\\n\\nBeer: 3.5/5\\nThe hefeweizen was okay, banana and wheat notes were there but tasted a little watered down. The dunkel tasted better and was a better deal. \\n\\nOverall I'd say come in for happy hour and order a pizza at Yellow Brick while you drink, then eat that instead. I'll just find German sausage from a specialty meat store next time instead of getting food here - what a ripoff.

The service at this place gets worse and worse each time I visit. \\n\\nThe setup was fine. They brought us our menus, utensils, and tea. But after that, they decided to take a shit on customer service every chance they got. To order at this place, you fill out a paper menu with a pencil with your desired items, then wait for the waiter to come collect the menu. With this style of ordering, it seems like it would be common decency for the waiter to come check up on you to see if you've finished filling out your sheet. But the waiters at this place like to pretend you don't exist after they drop off the initial items, and then make you flag them down to turn in your order form.\\n\\nIt's also pretty normal for waiters to come check in once in the middle of the meal to top up drinks and make sure we're good. Well, they like to skip that part too at this Chef Hung's. You'd think that since we ordered dessert, they would at LEAST keep track of when we were almost done eating. But they took their sweet ass time wandering around the restaurant ignoring us. \\n\\nWe finally flagged down someone to let them know we're done eating and would like our dessert. The lady who was the manager, I think, immediately went to grab our dessert. But she didn't clear our table of our empty plates first. Rookie mistake, but forgivable. We had a very obvious portion of appetizer that was left on our table though, and she didn't ask us if we were finished with it, or ask if we wanted a box. At this point the salt is strongly flowing through me.\\n\\nThey toss us another curve ball by giving us 3 spoons total, for a party of 5. Well thank you very much manager lady. I can see your counting skills are top tier. \\n\\nI could've forgiven them for all of this, if that was the end of it. But they decided to take one giant mega shit to end all shits at the end. When we attempted to pay, the manager lady claimed that their credit card reader was broken so they could only accept cash. Well luckily, my  girlfriend is observant, quick witted, and can speak Chinese. She saw that they checked out a party just 5 minutes earlier with their credit card just fine. She laid the smack down in Chinese and tore that manager lady a new asshole. \\n\\nIf there's one thing I can't stand, it's lying to your customers.

If you go frequently enough have a backup for those days when the server is off.\\n\\nYou may be wondering why I gave a place 4 stars if it has such a serious issue.  The reason is because once you find that perfect server you can't stop eating at this place.

It was home. My husband who is from Mexico and had never heard of any of this stuff gave me his usual nervous excited look when I take him to try new things. We got the Ye-Beg tibs and Awaze tibs (couldn't be bothered with veggies that night). As we waited my husband joked about how the table we were sitting at looked like a giant sombrero. You can see into the kitchen and watch them work their magic, which is half the fun. The food came out at what I would say is the appropriate amount of time, and armed with plenty of injera we dug right in. The Ye-Beg tibs were juicy and balanced with the spice blend you can only find in Ethiopian/Eritrean cooking, the Awaze was that addicting kind of spicy where you start sweating a little bit and do the sucking thing to cool down your mouth but then go back and fish out the jalape√±os with your next bite.

I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and my friend ordered the oyster hash. Our food came out in 20 minutes and we enjoyed it. The griddle cakes were sweet and light while the chicken was the perfect amount to go with the cakes. Lightly battered and fried but the taste of the oil or seasoning left an interesting aftertaste, when eating the chicken alone. Together with the griddle cakes and maple syrup it was a great combo. The oyster hash was good, I would say the potatoes were seasoned perfectly and the oyster was the taste of the sea, however the breading felt a little thick toward the end. \\n\\nOur server checked in again after five minutes of getting our food as we had a few bites but didn't come back again until an hour later when we were ready to get our check and a water refill.

Definitely lived up to the hype! The place even had great ambiance. My boyfriend had the special pancake and loved it. Perfect fall flavors.

The options for sandwiches all sounded amazing; I got the Bravas (the one with the prosciutto and chorizo on torta bread) which was really tasty but a tad too salty for me, and my boyfriend got the bbq brisket which really hit the spot. Service was also spot-on; we never had to wait long for a refill on coffee and the entire staff was super friendly.

Alia is one of my favorite local dining spots, and they do most everything right, so I really hope that Rustic Table is a success.  We wanted to check it out for dinner, but since we have a toddler in tow, we were sure to get there pretty early (5ish) to avoid crowds and otherwise potentially uncomfortable scenarios that could come up when your dining partner enjoys dipping her fingers in the bread oil.  It was pouring outside, so we didn't get much of a chance to assess the atmosphere through the windows - but we did notice from our cursory glance that it looked slightly fancy.  We went in and saw Said, and expressed our concern, but he assured us that it was totally fine for us.  And when he led us around the corner, we were actually quite surprised by the size of the place.  What is visible from the street is basically the bar, but then that leads into a much larger room with two levels of seating.  We grabbed a nice table in the back (right by the French doors which open up onto a big porch - sure to be lovely in the warm weather).  \\n\\nThe server brought some warm bread and olive oil/olive dipping oil over (the same as is served at Alia) and took our drink orders.  It's nice that Rustic Table offers alcohol, since Alia is BYOB.  The menu was varied, with several different apps (I noticed falafel, baked buffalo wings) and many seafood entrees.  Our family is vegetarian, so we didn't have much to choose from, but they were happy to accommodate.  They offered to make us a veggie roll-up from the bar menu, so we got one of those, and they said we could get the lobster mac and cheese made vegetarian as well, so we got some of that as well.  Everything was good, though I'm hoping that they have a few more meat-free options in the future.\\n\\nWinthrop is lucky to have so many fun dining establishments, and this is a great addition to the mix."},{"name":"Nisa's Thai","address":"622 Washington St","city":"Canton","stars":"4","text":"Excellent and quick for take out.

For the most part, they delivered. \\n\\nI came for a weekday business lunch and my initial impression was surprise by the small interior. My counterpart was seated at a two-top with just enough space from the table next to us for me to slide in & sit down. \\n\\nWe were greeted promptly by a pleasant waitress. I took my time reviewing the menu - all foreign to an Ethiopian food virgin - and the waitress was very patient. Whew, no pressure to hurry up & decide! Even for a newbie, the menu was relatively easy to navigate. \\n\\nOne of my favorite things about this place is non-tangible and clever...the kitchen rules. Don't worry, they're not rules per se, telling you what not to do - they're more of a credo to ensure customer satisfaction. My favorites - rule #1 - we're here to make you happy & rule #3 - if you're unhappy with your dish, let us know...we're more than happy to accommodate. Ahhhh...sigh of relief! Who wouldn't be happy with 'rules' like this? \\n\\nWith confidence I could easily exchange my order if I didn't like it, I decided on the most popular dish - the tibs. I opted for lamb, injera, and tomato fit fit ($12.50). \\n\\nThe order came out within minutes. The lamb...love at first bite! Soooo surprisingly tender & full of flavor. Not only did it have a great char to it, but it had a slight bit of heat from peppers. One small downside - some fatty, gristly pieces of lamb. Tomato fit fit? What the wha? It was very tasty, but I wasn't expecting what I saw...diced tomatoes with injera (sponge like bread). It looked funky but citrusy flavor paired well with the lamb. And finally, for the kid in me who likes to play with food - the injera rocks! It looks like something you'd find on the beach! The texture - two words - freaky cool. It feels damp and sponge-like. My counterpart wanted to bounce it off the table. We stopped playing with it long enough to finally eat it! The taste? Sort of tastes like sourdough. And is the perfect companion to sop up juices!! \\n\\nI had enough for leftovers and ordered a side of cabbage to take home. I usually love cabbage but I wasn't crazy about theirs. I'm used to simply prepared - salt & pepper. This one had a little too much going on. Too bad I wasn't at the restaurant to exchange it! \\n\\nAll in all, a very enjoyable meal and a place I'd return to. I'm sure it'll take a while for the novelty of injera to wear off!

I I will first start by stating that it's a little hidden, which may be intentional.  We did not find it by locating the address, but  by seeing all of the cars going to this one establishment. Of note, they do valet park your car for a mere $2.00!! I don't know of any other place in the Buckhead  area that provides Valet parking at such a reasonable price (coming from a gal who  rarely hangs out) . After parking, we walked to what appeared to be the entrance. The door is the first indication of what you are in for. The door  and the light fixtures are massive- but just grab the huge handle and pull! We were then greeted by a gentleman who checked our id and stamped our hand (reminiscent of going to chuck e cheese!  If you have been then you know what I mean).  Upon entering the establishment  I actually got excited, as it just felt and looked like a place I would enjoy. \\n So anyway to sum up Painted Pins- it truly is an Upscale  Chuck-E-Cheese for adults!  I witnessed people bowling (extensive wait time- we were told at least 4 hours), playing basketball, bocce ball, shuffle board, skee- ball, and  darts. Unfortunately we did not indulge in any of the  gaming activities offered.  We spent the majority of our time at the bar- for the sake of having  a \\"space\\".

The fries were also crispy too, though that runs out with all the toppings on them, so eat them fresh and hot.\\n\\nThe Mix'd Up burger is 1/2 lb angus beef pattie that comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheese.

They have a patio on the ever busy Burnet Road, so I wouldn't say it's a quiet, intimate patio, but it's cute. The decor inside is eye-catching, in an odd sort of way. It seemed a bit overdone in my opinion, but I suppose you have to decide for yourself if you enjoy looking at tons of Mona Lisa heads painted all over the wall, with Frank Sinatra's winking at you here and there. \\n\\nFor lunch, Gusto's is not presumably well known for as it was not busy at all. But they do offer weekday lunch specials 11am-4pm. So you would think that lunch would be quick, but everything seemed sort of slow, even with the few patrons dining. They had some decently priced lunch options for under $9. I ordered the 1/2 portion of the spinach lasagna and the ceasar salad. I found neither to be very original or memorable. I ate it all, but I found myself daydreaming about another spinach lasagna instead not too far south of Burnet. The portions were perfectly small for me, but I'd imagine someone bigger than me who is very hungry might not want to order the small lunch special. The food was MEH, but I ate it all because it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't something I'll be talking about or recommending since it was pretty bland. \\n\\nI looked at the drink menu and while they do have a nice wine selection with not too overly pretentious wine by the glass, I was disappointed to see that my favorite cheap white wine is sold here for $6 a glass and $24 for the bottle (A bottle is like $8 at HEB). UGH, but I guess such is life when it comes to ordering a glass of wine at a restaurant. \\n\\nThe good things: Happy hour is from 4pm-7pm every day, $2 off all appetizers and pizzas, 25% off all bottles of wine, $1 off draught beers, and $2 off vermouth cocktails.

How do I know that?  I asked myself 2 hours later how I felt.  I felt fine.  They passed my MSG litmus test.  This is important to me since, soon after graduating from college and during the work day, lunching at a trendy Szechuan restaurant, in Beverly Hills no less, necessitated that I go home in my suit and tie in the early afternoon sweating and then ... never mind ...\\n\\nIf you are looking for a Chinese spin on haute cuisine, forget it.  This place is mom and pop and has a bar in the front while the restaurant is in the back.  It's usually the other way around.

The only issue was the fortune cookie.  The fortune was good, but the cookie was sort of stale.  Don't be bringing me no God damn stale fortune cookies!  Have you ever gotten a hold of a bag of fresh, savory fortune cookies, eaten 2 dozen, and then picked the best fortune?  I wasn't planning on doing that.  However, please make sure the fortune cookies are of newer vintage.\\n\\nThe lady took my order quickly.  It's funny how the Asian folks who run restaurants can be very arms-length, stoic, and business-like OR  they can be more animated, attempting to make small talk and being a little silly in the process.  I prefer the latter and that's what I got.  The lady was a hoot and the food arrived quickly.  I devoured it quickly, too.  The only thing was that I had to track her down to get my bill so I could pay and leave.  She asked me to take a paper menu and to come back.  I think I will.  I spotted about 4 other lunch entree line items I'd like to try over time.\\n\\nSo, Happy Fortune will fill up your tank and make sure you are a happy camper, in a good 3 star sort of way.  For that matter, a fresher fortune cookie should sport a message such as \\"Happy Fortune Make You Happy Camper.\\"  Like I said, it's quick and convenient, and reminds me of some mom and pop Chinese places I'd go to in L.A. with a similar set up and where they remembered what I'd order every time, so that made for some good karma.

I did not share this with anyone. The fried chicken was good. I don't like using that word, \\"good,\\" with relation to BS but it was just good: the pickle slices I'm sure were made in-house and all that, but the sauce it was coated in was one-note. Some citrus would have balanced it out nicely, maybe with a few sprigs of something leafy. \\n\\nBy now you know me and desserts. It's a problem. The beetus is in my future at this rate.

Nice, simple, and old fashioned (as the name suggests) - this traditional classic makes the breakfast meal complete. Blueberry bourbon and basil was WOW. It had a fruity but refreshing taste! Get it. Wow, at this rate ... dulce de leche and hazelnut. DANG! You know what? Just get all 3, including the ones you want. Why? Because that's what I would've done but I HAD to try the other cuisine in Portland so .. you know, need the extra stomach space.\\n\\nAnyways, Blue Star is a very hip and fun place to grab donuts, drink good (straight up black coffee), and then turn around and order some more damn good donuts.

This place didnt really execute that for me. Thai tea was very small, and also didnt taste authentic. Food was also on the pricier side. Cool ambiance, decent service, but food didnt hit the spot for me.\\n\\nI remember wanting to come here because i saw alot of bloggers post about it. Im thinking maybe i ordered the wrong things?

I was originally hesitant to check them out because I didn't think I'd like the fondue experience, but I was very wrong.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I took advantage of their Magical Dining special for $35 per person. We got to pick one Cheese Fondue appetizer that we shared, which was Wisconsin Cheddar. It came with pieces of bread, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower and even apples. I thought it was okay, not my favorite, but my boyfriend loved it. He's big on cheese, where I'm not so much. \\n\\nFor the meal portion you get to pick the cooking style. (FYI... they bring you raw food that you cook in the pot so be prepared to wait, but savor the food). We choose Mojo broth and our meats were Chicken & Vegetable Potstickers, Chicken Breast, Sirloin, Shrimp and Vegetables. Each of us, even got our own sauce plate with 6 different options for our selection: Teriyaki, Curry Mustard, Plum, Cocktail Sauce, Gorgonzola and Green Goddess. They paired nicely. \\n\\nDessert was by far my favorite part. We chose the Cookies N' Cream Marshmallow Dream. It came with Brownie bites, Pound Cake bits, Marshmallows, Strawberries, Bananas and my ultimate favorite: Rice Crispy Treats. The combinations were perfect. \\n\\nAnd to top off the overall experience we had an AMAZING server named Malik. He was personable, attentive, funny and truly made the night so enjoyable.

I say a little because I am somewhat oblivious so it is quite possible that it's there and I just never noticed. I frankly have never asked myself what folks at other tables thought of me or of anything for that matter, so if anyone ever expended any energy giving me the evil eye there it must have been a pretty frustrating effort on their part.

The wine list is fantastic, as are their cocktails. Other huge pluses for Giuseppe's: they locally source, their chicken is free range, almost anything on the menu can be requested as gluten free, and there are plenty of choices for our vegetarian friends, making it a great choice for an eclectic group. They have a small but really nice patio, inside the acoustics are perfect, even when packed I have never found it to be loud.

It all just feels... off.\\n\\nNo longer do the owners seem to treat patrons like someone who wants coffee, but instead they treat them like an out-of-towner, while also giving them the most non-coffee-house experience.\\n\\nFor example, at any other coffee shop you'd order your food and drink, pay, wait for it to be complete, and go have a seat. \\n\\nHere they treat it like a restaurant: order your food, go sit down, food/drink brought to you, and when you're done, you come back and pay. \\n\\n...what? \\n\\nThey'll also come by and ask you how things are-- even if you're just having a coffee, even if you have headphones in and are reading a book.\\n\\nLastly, they will trip over themselves to tout that this is the oldest coffee house in Portland. It's not; that title goes to Rimsky-Korsakoffee, est. in 1980 (vs. Anna's in 1989). And if you call them on that, they say it doesn't count since Rimsky's sells alcohol (...what?).\\n\\nIt is hard not to feel crestfallen from the new awkward Anna experience after I had been coming here long before this new older couple had ever been running the business.\\n\\nIf you want a genuine coffee house experience, visit Rimsky's, or even Rocking Frog over on Belmont.\\n\\nEdit: Docked another star on account the owners defensively jump down your throat (I got a private message within 12 hours of my review! such service!) if you write anything less than a positive review about the place, and can't help but salt their attempts at placating with a very patronizing and passive-aggressive, dismissive tone. It's akin to Donald Trump, actually: \\"Hey, everyone else says we're great so you're wrong. Believe me.\\"\\n\\nIn fact, that's the thing that's off about this place, and coincides with the imposter metaphor I'd used earlier: the politeness at Anna's is paper thin.

On one hand I find it delicious going down but it gives you horrible breath AND somehow seems extremely hard to digest (TMI I know). Consequently, I'm prone to ordering the mildest spice level possible to mitigate the possible after-effects.\\n\\nI like The Clay Pit. It's probably my favorite Indian restaurant in Austin. The one thing I don't like is that the lot fills up like crazy. However I'm usually able to find street parking, so I guess it isn't that big of deal. In addition they have a pretty legit reservation policy in that they'll only hold reservations for 10 minutes after the scheduled time and your entire party must be there. I like this, it prevents weird holdups when you're waiting for your table. I hate it when the table in front of you arrives late and is still eating because this then bleeds into your time. \\n\\nAs far as food is concerned, I can't really verify authenticity. I used to eat Indian food at a restaurant called \\"Ashoka\\" in Troy, MI which my Indian friends recommended to me. Whenever I went I took their recommendations and got the Butter Chicken. Since then, I've had many a horrible tasting Butter Chicken so I no longer order it (unless I'm home). I personally always get the Mheen Curry here. It's interesting, I can taste the coconut milk and basil in it and honestly, it kind of reminds me of a fusion of Thai and Indian curry. It's pretty awesome since it comes with fish but I've swapped that out for shrimp before. My friend got the Lamb Vindaloo and ordered it at the highest possible spice level and reported that it \\"wasn't spicy enough\\". I'm not sure if that further testifies to an Americanized spice level because he's pretty spice tolerant.\\n\\nI think their specialty is that they have a very large variety of naan. Personally I like the Aloo Naan which is stuffed with potatoes. The garlic naan is tasty as well and they supposedly have a jalapeno/cream cheese naan. I've tried most of their varieties and I like them all.  \\n\\nThey also have a full bar, which is nice for the drinkers out there. For the past two Valentine's Day dinners, I've had a standing tradition of a singles dinner here and it's always worked out well. It's a good choice for great food pretty close to the UT campus and thus, worth checking out!"},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Had the schnitzel with red cabbage & kraut.\\n\\nThe schnitzel & kraut were awesome.

I was hoping for better and felt disappointed at the price I paid for the food I received. The food was ready when I arrived to pick it up, and I do recommend ordering online as it was very fast and efficient. We got the fried rice (delicious but a bit steep at around 11 dollars for the portion we got), some unidentified pickled veggie (tip - mark what things are) that was pretty bland for a pickled item and seemed to be a throw in extra and 15 pieces of drums and wings (half soy and half spicy). The wings were not labelled and both tasted really spicy. They were also overcooked and some pieces were tiny. It was not a good value at all for $23. I honestly felt ripped off after I ate this food knowing that I paid almost $40 for it. It's not worth it. I'd recommend going with the smaller portion chicken (even though that was the main allure for us when ordering) and maybe trying some other items as some looked cool but it was already so expensive with just the rice and chicken that we didn't add on some like the octopus.

It seems that the restaurant is always busy which is always a good sign if you're unsure about a place.

In the back of the house s the dining area and bar. The decor in this place is very nice the outfits that some of the waitresses were wearing was a little much and stereotypical haha\\n\\nFood review:\\n\\nI opted for the Bahama mama platter instead of the all you can eat buffet. I have no regrets. The bahama mama is essentially a blend of beef and pork with some seasoning and spices. The sausage wasn't spicy like everyone said it was and hardly tasted any heat to it. The sausage itself as a whole was very flavorful and cooked perfectly with perfect seasoning and wasn't salty at all! The platter comes with sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, apple sauce and a slice of bread.\\n\\nThe sauerkraut could possibly one of the best i've every had with it being perfectly tart.

The service at the Brook is stellar. Employees generally care about you and your meals. The one problem with the Brook is that the selection and variety on the menu is not extremely large. Although the selection may be small, the food is prepared with care and tenderness. My favorite item on the menu, the ultimate chicken sandwich, just melts in your mouth. The steak tips are delicious as well. The Brook is a fantastic place to go with friends or family due to welcoming staff, delicious food, and a warm environment."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":".\\nBEAT ME DODDY, EIGHT TO THE (BURGER) BAR!\\n\\nWell, I gotta tell ya, there's a NEW \\"Burger King\\" in town (no, definitely not THOSE guys).\\n\\nIt's HOPDODDY, on South Congress!\\n\\nI will stop short of calling this a \\"boutique burger\\" place, because to me, that conjures up images of \\"foodsnobbery\\", girls in their Jimmy Choo's, etc, etc. Just the kind of place I DON'T like to go to, unless the food's REALLY  good.\\n\\nWell, the food IS really good, but there's not a hint of the aforementioned personality flaw, so I guess I'm safe, even if it is in / on (I'm about to gag...) SoCo (oops, I just hurled). \\n\\nHopdoddy has a standard burger for you \\"Cow-nivores\\", but a myriad of other wonderful choices: Bison (my favorite); Lamb; Turkey; Sushi-Grade Tuna; and a Black Bean-Corn Patty (not) \\"burger\\" for you veg-heads who think animals have more rights than your taste buds. I'll never have one of the latter, but I'm sure they're good too. \\n\\nBut not to worry, vegans; I AM a member of PETA (aka: People Eating Tasty Animals). And I always wear my cowhide boots and lambskin jacket to every meeting. Lambs are soooooooo cute at that age! \\n \\nHopdoddy also has what they call \\"Texas Akaushi Beef\\" (the Primetime burger); their former menu called it \\"American Kobe Beef\\". I think someone may have taken issue with that label, cuz Kobe can't be CALLED Kobe unless it's from the Kobe region of Japan, as I understand it, like Champagne or Tequila must come from certain regions to carry that moniker.  \\n\\nAnyway, the Primetime is the MOST EXPENSIVE burger on the menu, so of course, Larry just HAD to try it. Now, you can't go wrong with anything on Hop's menu, but take my advice: The Primetime is NOT worth the extra money, IMHO. If it WAS, I wouldn't mind splurging in the least. So I hope you can learn from my mistake. Hey, I'm making these tasting sacrifices for YOU, my people!\\n\\nSo far, I've had the Goodnight; Buffalo Bill; Llano Poblano; and the aforementioned Primetime. ALL were extremely tasty. Next time I'm gonna get brave and take on EL DIABLO. Unlike some other places with something \\"x-tra hot\\" on the menu, they don't make you sign a waiver, but they DO provide you with a free BIG glass of milk. THAT should tell you how potentially hot it may be, and THAT should also move you to PRAY FOR ME!\\n\\nCan't fail to mention the KENNEBEC FRIES. There IS a difference when it comes to spuds. These are possibly the best fries I've ever had! Cut to just the right dimensions, crispy on the out, fluffy on the in, even as they cool off, unlike \\"Dacamo\\" (my personal nickname for ClownTown).\\n\\nBuns are baked in-house and are TERRIFFIC! \\n\\nI would have written this review earlier, but I was waiting to see how Hopdoddy responded to a phone call I made directly to them about their pricepoint for a \\"Bison upgrade\\" on other burgers besides the one that already comes with a Bison patty. Their pricepoint was in line with SOME of their competitors, but WAY out of line compared to a couple of other upscale burger joints that are just a good. Would my comment fall on deaf ears, or not?\\n\\nI'm happy to say Hopdoddy came through, and I have good news. BISON PATTY UPGRADE IS NOW ONLY $1, NOT $3 AS BEFORE. HOORAY FOR HOPDODDY! It made MY \\"fifth star\\" a no-brainer, for their quality, PLUS sensitivity to customer input. Yes, Virginia, there is STILL justice in this world! \\n\\nI encourage you all to get the Bison. It's leaner than beef, accordingly healthier, and you are supporting an environmentally more compatible animal. Bison don't tear up the topsoil nearly as much as Beef cattle do. \\n\\nBison: Better for YOU, better for the ENVIRONMENT. I try to amuse, but I'm NOT joking here. \\n\\nWhatever Government official(s) came up with the idea that you could eliminate all the Native Americans by killing off all the Bison were very short-sighted. There were far-reaching consequences that the Politicians failed to recognize. Glad things have changed??? Yeah, they're WORSE now!\\n\\nWell, them pesky \\"Injuns\\" are still here (thank God), but our TOPSOIL is NOT, much of it lost in the 30's during the Dust Bowl, largely due to over-grazing by Beef Cattle, along with drought. \\n\\nOprah told me I'd better stop right THERE.\\n\\nSorry for the politicizing; this is supposed to be about Hopdoddy. But I can't help it, when I know I'm RIGHT. \\n\\nThe one negative, already covered by other reviewers, is their befuddling customer-flow pattern. You'll see when you go, but not a problem, in view of the quality of the food and service. \\n\\nI strongly encourage you to check out Hopdoddy, SEVERAL times. These folks make a GREAT line of burgers and sides, at a price unheard of in \\"SoCo-Land\\" (there I do gaggin' again, sorry). And they buy LOCALLY whenever possible.\\n \\nPlease check 'em out.

We were lucky enough to snag a parking spot in their private lot. But, for the amount of people frequenting this spot, their lot was quite small. There was a line of people out the door as well. Although, it seemed as if it was moving at a decent pace. Before even entering the restaurant, we ordered some sparkling water at the walk up counter to quench our thirst in this heat. \\n\\nInside, we passed through a display of their bbq sauce and rub products that were available for purchase to take home. Then, we came to their a la carte sides station. We ordered two pints of their mac and cheese and two of their banana pudding desserts. Finally, we ordered one beef rib and 1/3 of a pound of jalape√±o cheese sausage at their meats station.\\n\\nWe weren't able to find a table inside as it was packed. So, we proceeded to find a table outside, where there were fans to somehow help with the heat. Although, it was still sweltering hot. There was a cooler with ice that contained their bbq sauces: original, spicy, and sweet. To be honest, their sauces were too sweet for our liking. We only tried the original and spicy. We didn't even bother to try their sweet sauce. The spicy sauce was the better of the two sauces, with a tangy, mustardy taste. But, it wasn't spicy at all. I prefer Rudy's spicy, peppery, and tangy bbq sauce. \\n\\nAs far as their meats go, their beef rib was rich. The meat was soft enough and fell off the bone. It was a good beef rib, but it wasn't the best we've had. We did appreciate the outer parts of the rib that tasted peppery and almost like beef jerky. Their jalape√±o cheese sausage was good, but it wasn't great. The cheese didn't add much umph, in our opinion. Rudy's jalape√±o sausage was better. \\n\\nTheir mac and cheese was creamy and rich, but surprisingly bland. We added a ton of black pepper, salt, and spicy bbq sauce to bring out the flavor. But, these didn't help it very much. We also ordered too much because we were ordering with our stomachs, not our eyes. Lol. One pint of mac and cheese would've been enough to feed 2 (even 3) people. We ordered two pints and regretted it later. Safe to say, we still won't be ordering the mac and cheese again because it just lacked flavor. However, their banana pudding was the best thing we ate here. It's definitely made from scratch. It had light and creamy layers of custard, softened Nilla wafers, whipped cream, and ripe bananas. They added a crispy Nilla wafer on top for a slight contrast in texture. It was pure heaven. If we ever visit this spot again, we will unapologetically order just this dessert. \\n\\nIn short, if you like sweet bbq sauces, this might be your go to spot. We haven't tried all their meats and sides. So, there may be something that might be excellent here that we missed. But, we would definitely give a strong thumbs up for their banana pudding. Come check them out for yourself."},{"name":"Frontier Public House","address":"4909 NE Hazel Dell Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've been here a few times and find the food solid and the service excellent.

She got those and I ordered something crazy, with tons of cheese and a side of beans, etc. It was the only combo that had two eggs over easy, that's all I know. Anyway, we were very satisfied with our food, and the munudo and hot caldo looked delicious, too.

The BBQ Chicken pizza isn't on the menu any longer, but you can still or it. BBQ sauce, chicken, onions, peppers,bacon (subbed out for mushrooms), scallions, and lots of cheese. So I went to use the gift card that was suppose to have money on it? Expired. Her sister told her it had $30 on it... oh well. Food paid for, out the door and into the oven the pizza went.\\n\\nFor a fast food type pizza place this was better than most. Heads above pizza slut, pizza inn or Papa Johns.

The thick, black bean patty had mild seasoning but was dressed with chipotle aioli and the usual lettuce, tomato, onion to give it a soft, warm tasty bite and light crunch. I normally don't order vegetarian burgers but I would order this again. At first the Caesar salad didn't look like there was enough dressing, for the portion size, but after mixing it up there was and it was good. The dressing wasn't overly powerful, it was just right.\\n\\nAfter happy hour we didn't have room to continue our plans with dinner.

I have a few suggestions that I feel would go a long way towards making the dining experience much more enjoyable.  \\n\\n#1. Our server did not inform us of the special. We saw the table next to ours get it and we inquired. Glad we asked because it was one of our favorites. I suggest that the server always mention the special or that it's written somewhere visible.  \\n\\n#2. The hostess,  along with some other staff members, swooped in to grab our plates before we were finished with them several times.  So,  the dishes are small (some are 2 bites) and you really want to enjoy each bite,  but the constant interruptions of people removing plates WHILE YOU'RE CHEWING just ruin the experience. We had to rush through our bites several times because people were asking \\"can I take this plate?\\" Ugh.  You have a mouth full of delicious food that you have to eat quickly to respond. The hostess even took a plate that still had food on it. THAT was super annoying.  Our mouths were full and she swooped right in and took the plate.  She didn't even ask if we were done with it.

The \\"pho\\" was basically  a fusion between Chinese wontons, Japanese ramen noodles, and Vietnamese pho broth. I'm not sure if any of these cuisines actually have a dish like that, but I love ramen noodles and wontons. The soup was also very light and healthy (but flavorful) like pho broth, so this was pretty much the perfect combination for me. The black tonkotsu also had a very rich broth, but it's more thick and oily if that's what you like. The noodles were chewy, and the toppings were good.

In fact, after reading Joe C's review, I commented that his beautifully written descriptions of dishes did nothing to entice me to eat here.  BUT, when the bar is using the fabulous Alicia K's clarified, pure, natural, scienced-the-eff-up mixers in their drinks, I had to come check out the new Barley.\\n\\nMy first (and only) visit to the other location is legendary.  Not so lovingly referred to as The Bataan Death March, suffice to say BS left a bad taste in my mouth.  This visit, however, started off much better.  I was there when they opened on a weeknight, got princess parking in front (even the valet guy was envious of my spot), and I was the ONLY person there for about 30-40 minutes which meant I got very friendly and personal service from Dustin the bartender.  \\n\\nRegardless of what you think of the food here, the bar program is LEGIT.  Again, I wanted to check out something with Alicia's mixers so I started with the Sieur de La Salle cocktail.  This is a sure example of my love for Alicia because I would NEVER drink a cocktail of BEETS otherwise.  It was really tasty, with only a slight dirt aftertaste, and I was thankful I had on black scrubs as I shakily lifted that overfilled, bright purple drink to my lips.  BUT, the best thing about the bar is their ability to improvise.  When asked to \\"just make me somethin\\", Dustin came up with this amazing, gorgeous cocktail, now dubbed the Green Goddess, that incorporated gin, chartreuse and Alicia's clarified lime juice.  Dustin, with his tattoos, blue eyes, man bun and skillz in the bar, has become my new imaginary boyfriend.\\n\\nI am trying to eat a little better since the new year but holidays and birthdays and spontaneous happy hours sure make that difficult.  I had a Snap Kitchen at home to eat that nite but still wanted to try one BS dish.  A few drinks and the excitement of a new place will make you adventurous and so I said \\"Fuck Snap Kitchen!\\".  I don't know when I'll be back here again so I ordered the craziest (to me) thing on the menu.  That octopus tentacle, while substantial, was tender enough to cut with a fork, but the pig's feet fried rice was the porky, smoky star of the dish.  The other item that intrigued me was \\"Bacon curd with pintos and mustard greens\\".  Sounded like soul food in a bowl and while really tasty, not exactly the soul food I was thinking, unless it was the soul of a highborn honkie.\\n\\nOnce again, I'll reiterate what a lot of folks say, this is very creative cooking.  Come in with an adventurous spirit, have a few spirits, and pig knuckle down on something you wouldn't otherwise eat.

Here's why:\\n\\n- Great Portion (Quality over Quantity)\\n- Amazing flavor combinations that are perfectly paired (Burger condiments)\\n- Good service\\n- Trendy but simple decor \\n- Unique Milkshakes (Krispy Kreme, Fois Gras, Cap'n Crunch & Peanut Butter Foam)\\n\\nMy favorites include the \\"Butcher's Cut\\" (Blue Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Red Wine Jam & Frise) and the \\"Bacon + Cheese\\" (Benton's Bacon, American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, B&B Pickles, Ketchup & Flip Sauce) with Tempura-Fried Okra or the Flip French Fries. I'm not a huge fan of Blue Cheese but it is SO delicious on the Butcher's Cut and really enhances the whole burger flavor. \\n\\nThe portions are perfect so when you leave, you don't feel overly stuffed. I would recommend sharing an order of fries between two people. I have never finished the fries on my own no matter how hungry I was because the portion size is too much for one person.\\n\\nI recommend getting at least ONE milkshake and splitting that with someone as well. When divided into two, it's the perfect amount for two people. My favorite shake is the \\"Nutella with Burnt Marshmallow\\" shake.

In fact, she came by and asked my two colleagues if they wanted another round of drinks and paid no attention to the fact that I still had no tacos. Eventually, the manager walks by and asks how our dinner is. I told him what had happened and kept a chipper demeanor about it cause I know that everyone makes mistakes.

On weekends, they open at 9am, so get in line before then, hopefully you get in for their first round of sitting.  It's next door to L'Hermitage Hotel so go towards that.  \\n\\nVery nice d√©cor inside, warm, welcoming and comfy. We made the first sitting, and we sorta already knew what we wanted for brunch so it didn't take long for us to put in our order. After a few minutes of looking at the menu to confirm our choices, we got a couple of lattes to start the morning right. Lattes were tasty, nicely made, they do have alternative milks too if you want almond milk etc.  \\n\\nThe items on the menu are mostly Moroccan/Mediterranean inspired but approachable and recognizable to try. We decided to get the \\"Tagine\\" and the \\"Fricassee\\" for brunch. If you like a little spicy for breakfast, the Tagine is perfect, spicy sausage with chickpeas with 2 nicely poached eggs. Comes with wonderful focaccia bread on the side as well for dipping & sopping.  \\n\\nFricassee was wonderful as well, braised short ribs with some potatoes, cheese and this tasty tomato sauce with 2 sunny side up eggs on top. Also comes with focaccia for dipping & sopping. This was very good, good amount of short ribs in the dish, quite hearty and nicely presented. \\n\\nWe were pretty full afterwards but couldn't turn down their Liege Waffles for dessert and got 2.  \\nThey do offer toppings for each so we got one with white chocolate pistachio rosewater, yea....that's what I said. It was pretty good and can definitely taste the floral-ness of the rosewater. The other topping we got was fig orange marmalade, this was definitely my jam, no pun intended.  \\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed our brunch very much, everything was nicely made, tasted wonderful and service was great. Prices are a bit higher but nothing unreasonable and I was satisfied with the food and service so I felt it was worth it.

I can't even rave about this place enough. Bf and I were visiting Austin for ACL and he had been to Barley Swine once before and he kept telling me how amazing this place was and he has quite good taste in food so I was excited and my expectations were high. Boy did this place not only impress but blow my mind. \\n\\nCustomer Service : The hostess and overall staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. They went out of their way to make our experience here great. My bf is a bit particular with his drinks and likes a certain flavor of Negroni and the bartender and staff treated us like royalty to make sure they made a drink to his flavor. Bartender even came and spoke to us to get a better understand of his flavor profiles and preferences. Our waitress was amazing. I love someone who is extremely insightful about the menu and can give me the best idea of what to expect when I order a dish and she did such that. ( FYI- Barley Swine is a shared plate style restaurant so expect to order multiple dishes to try) \\n\\nFood: the food was absolutely phenomenal , not one dish let us down. We are a very vegetarian/ pescatarian couple so did not order any of the meats (beef/ pork/ chicken) but regardless our dining experience was amazing. \\n\\nMushroom Chorizo Tostada- 4.5/5 , Delicious and fresh. \\nShishito Mousse - 5/5 , this was one of my favorite dishes, the flavors were amazing and the melons were such an interesting addition but delicious \\nShiitake Dumplings- 5/5 , soup dumplings with a burst of flavor in every bite . The soft cooked eggs were so creamy and well paired \\nBlue Crab Fundido- 4.6/5 , the homemade tater tots were crispy and delicious, could use a little more crab but overall , fab!\\nBBQ Field Pea Tempeh- 4.5/5 , I'm picky with tempeh and this was so creamy and tasteful. This had an asian fusion and is not typical BBQ flavor , it was subtle and flavorful. \\nBlackened Red Fish- 10/5 Lol, this was our favorite dish. The redfish was the best I've ever had , tender, flaky just enough, moist, and favors with the couscous , red plum , and mint were explosions. \\nPeach Tart - 4/5 , different and not overly sweet. Buttery crust with nopal . Different flavors and unique \\nFig Cacao Nib Tr√®s L√®ches - 5/5 , honestly best tr√®s l√®ches I've ever had. The cacao crust was amazing and the cake wasn't overly soggy . It was just right. \\nMocktails- im not drinker and they had the best mocktail fusions I've ever had. They can also spike it if you are feeling rebellious lol\\n\\nOverall, if I could give Barley Swine a 10 , I would! If you are ever in Austin, this is a must try and we definitely will be back to try their vegetarian menu."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Can you ever avoid the line up for this place?\\n\\nI walked by Medina a number of times during my visit to Vancouver.  The hotel I stayed in was just a block down.  Every time I passed, there was ALWAYS a line....to the point where I didn't really want to entertain the idea of trying this place because i felt like perhaps it was more hype than anything else but my friend, who recently visited, begged a differ.\\n\\nSo I got up one morning stood in line at 7:45am there was already 2 parties ahead of me and by the time it was nearly 8am (when they open) the line was down the block, on a Wednesday morning. At 8am the restaurant opened and we were seated promptly, we were in a somewhat rush and didn't want our order to be stuck behind all the others that just seated too so we told our waiter immediately what we wanted.\\n\\nOur table of four tried the Paella, Fricasse, Les Boulettes and Le Complet.  Everyone loved what they ordered.  The flat iron steak wiuth the Le Complet was easily a knock out, perfectly cooked (sous vide I assume) and finished on the fire, tender, juicy, just that ideal steak taste and texture.  The lamb sausage in the Les Boulettes dish was delicious and had a strong lamb flavour with complementing spices and a bit of heat.   Braised short ribs from the Fricasse dish were fall off the bone, tender and flavourful.  The cous cous, my least favourite dish wasn't made from actualy cous cous but that rice shaped pasta you wuld find at the cold salad bar, I personally didn't like it but my sister loved it and the waitress did give us the heads up about it being more like a pasta before we ordered.\\n\\nOverall the flavours of the menu were very Middle Eastern or Morroccan inspired, not your typical brunch spot.  It's different, not completely unique but if you're tired of just eggs and bacon and down for something that is more spice heavy then give this a shot.

With tightly scheduled hours, and a parking lot where most patrons just create their own parking spot there you have the creators of Odd Duck. To be completely honest I have never eaten at their trailer nor had H. But we were up for something new and close by. \\n\\nThe website said you could call head of time to check on availability of seating. So thats what I did just a couple minutes after 6. Plenty of seating, so we were on our way. When we walked in, there are literally 4 tables total and something resembling a bar which faces the kitchen where the masterminds of cooking are hard at work. We were seated immediately at the end of one of the 4 tables. I must say, the staff are very well educated on the menu and the drinks. After a nice recommendation we ordered 2 beers (large bottles) for $19 each. One was the Ommegang Hennepin the other was Ommegang Rare Vos, from Brooklyn NY.\\n\\nNow onto the food. The portions are small as stated, and they recommend 3 plates per person. Somewhat like tapas. The portions are presented in a way that is easy for 2 people to share. First we started off with the brussel sprouts. Apparently I like brussel sprouts, I never knew! They were AMAZING! The lemon added to them was addicting. They also put some complimentary olives at our table for us. But neither of us like olives so for the longest time they just sat there. Then I braved the unknown and popped one in my mouth. I couldn't believe it was an olive, because it tasted so damn good. We also ordered the shrimp & asparagus. It was beautiful and delicious. Had to get the potato fritters & goat cheese...these was amazing as well. The stuffed pig trotter was my least favorite but it was still good. It came with this soft boiled egg too which I thought was different. Braised short rib plate was interesting and memorable because I even tried the trumpet mushroom it came with. For 2 hungry people we had 5 dishes & 2 BIG beers. We were just the right amount of full. Their menu changes more than once a month, so be on the look out if you're wanting to try something specific. \\n\\nOh and we got a complimentary dessert thanks to Jason, who felt bad for asking us to change seats after we had first sat down.

At $2.25 per piece, I thought the price was pretty okay and reasonable for macarons from what is supposed to be a fairly high end establishment. The selection is a bit lacking, I think they only had about 6-8 flavours on the day that I went, and none of them were very pretty... they were all kind of varying shades of brown/maroon, so that was a little disappointing. Granted, they are more of a general pastry cafe and not a specialty macaron shop, so I guess that is understandable. I sampled three macarons: salted caramel, coffee, and I think cassis. I can't really complain about any of the macarons - they were all pretty decently sized, pretty chewy and light, flavourful and not too sweet, and I enjoyed all of the flavours. While I was here I also tried their millefeuille and while it was pretty good it didn't really leave that much of an impression on me, maybe I was too focused on the macarons. All in all I have to say pretty solid macarons. Really I was a bit disappointed at the small selection and just the visual appearance of the macaron counter (the lack of colours), but I would come again in the future to take another look and try some other flavours."},{"name":"She's Not Here","address":"440 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me start by saying this place has incredible food and cocktails and based off those items, I would have left a five star review. Continue to read if you are looking to book a larger table or small birthday party. \\n\\nThis spot is perfect for a date or small group of people. However, when it comes to larger parties this establishment I would look elsewhere. I was given about a two hour notice that they do not split checks. They will take as many form as payments as needed but you must calculate the individual totals yourself. We had a party of ten which can be cumbersome when totaling out. In addition, there is a $26 cake cutting fee. Personally, I think that is a bit much so we ended up ordering dessert on site. Upon booking our reservation, the reservation coordinator pushed for a set chef's menu several times and upon arrival our server did too. The reason we booked a party less than 13 is so we had the option to select items from the entire menu that we each wanted to try. Initially, I received information based off of parties of 13 or more which do require a preset menu and 20% automatic service charge. I wish they hadn't been so pushy with preset menus. I'm sure this was with good intention but our group has a wide range of palettes and I did not want to limit their options.  \\n\\nWhen we received our checks our server suggested we split evenly between the ten of us however, I didn't think that was fair as some of our guest had an appetizer and others sampled several items from the menu along with an array of cocktails. She looked irritated when we started tallying our totals and minutes later said came back to our table and stated she would make an exception and split checks for us since it was a slower night. For this, I thank her! \\n\\nOverall the food and drinks are amazing and the service good. I would return for a date night or small group. \\n\\nRecommendations for \\"She's Not Here\\": 1) Split checks, it's 2019 and we have the technology so let's utilize it and make guest experiences flow with ease upon check out. 2)  Advertise the cake cutting fee and automatic gratuity charge for customers booking larger parties. Set expectations up front and be transparent.

We visited Frontier on a Tuesday night and were surprised at how busy it was for a weekday. The wait was about 15 min for a table, partially because a group of 12 had just been seated. And let me tell you the staff did a fantastic job for having to juggle such a group! There was a woman working behind the bar who had both grace and speed and was still helping out with busing and resetting tables. There was only a single waitress on the floor and she was a tiny speed demon zipping around the place. We hemmed and ha-ed because there were so many tasty options on the menu, and ultimately our food order went in after the group of 12. Although we waited a little longer for our food we weren't bothered because the bartender kept communicating with us and apologizing for the delay. The food came out perfect with the exception of the the fact that my burger was slightly overcooked for my taste-although I didn't specify how I would like it cooked so I can't complain much. The bacon wrapped jalapenos on the burger were fantastic-although they are in fact jalapenos, and without cream cheese I found myself wimping out sooner than expected. Be prepared for a burger that won't fit into your face with one bite. They also had some tasty Two Towns gluten free ciders on tap. \\n\\nThe bartender was super helpful with the food choices. The main reason we chose to come here was because they offer a decent amount of gluten free options-including buns for the burgers and gluten free fries and tots-although the fryer IS mixed so you might have some cross contamination. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because they don't have gluten free pasta! My boyfriend had their mac and cheese and I was basically drooling over it wishing I could order something similar. \\n\\nAnd last but not least, I enjoyed the ambiance of this place. The name Frontier and the signage outside makes it seem like it might have a western theme, but I was pleasantly surprised by the modern interior and relaxing but not quite romantic lighting. The dining room area has white table cloths and the vibe is slightly more upscale than I would expect for a pub, but the staff have a casual dress code and the customers were similarly dressed which makes me feel comfortable being seated at the bar in my less-than fine dining attire.\\n\\nI will definitely be back to try the sausage corn dog things!"},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"6247 Mcneil Drive","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"The service was great tonight!

I also tried the Chilcano (ginger beer, pisco, bitters), which was solid. And, finally, the Margarita Patada (jalape√±o-infused margarita, made with pisco that they infuse in house), which I can imagine would be a little shocking to the taste buds if you're not used to spice, but boy was it good - perhaps my favourite of the 3!  \\n\\nOnto the food.  The first time I visited I sampled probably 6 of the tapas, and the second time I was able to enjoy 4 courses from the dine out menu.  Stand outs for me were definitely the Cangrejo Causa (chilled potato topped with crab, avocado, mango), mixto ceviche (ceviche with various seafood), and the pan con chicharron (pork belly sliders --- these were so good we ordered a second round).  And, I'm still dreaming about the locuma white chocolate frozen torte they had featured on the dine out menu (seriously, it was soooo delicious, I ate the whole thing and I usually do not even like dessert!).  The only thing I did not enjoy was the lomo saltado, my two fellow diners and I all thought it was too salty and sort of tasted like something you might get from the japanese wok place in the food court (sorry guys!!!). That being said the menu is very diverse and I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try a few more new dishes!"},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Located inside Disney's Animal Kingdom, the Yak and Yeti is a great dining choice.   It is one of very few sit down eating options in the park.  Reservations are strongly recommended as the wait can be brutal.  There are also limited dinner options due to the park closing relatively early.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is run by Landry's and is very well done.

My favorite is the lentil rice.\\n3.  Deserts.  A little thin with cake, fresh watermelon and grapes.  Go with the watermelon.\\n\\nWe are lucky to have many Persian restaurants nearby, which is good for the consumer.  The competition keeps the quality up at all these places.\\n\\nHere is our modus operandi.  Sandy Springs Toyota is nearby, so we drop the car off for lube/oil/filter and tire rotate.

Jhol Chicken Momos - 5 stars - The tangy jhol sauce is mind blowing. I considered risking social politeness and packing up the remaining sauce after we finished our momos because this sauce is that good. \\n\\n2.) Spicy Chili Vegetable Fried Momos - 5 stars - A great twist on the classic momo \\n\\n3.) Chicken Tikka Masala - 5 stars - A less cream based and more tomato based chicken tikka masala is always going to be the most delicious in my eyes.\\n\\n4.) Chatamari (with ground chicken) - 4 stars - I'm glad we tried this dish! It was different from anything I have ever tried in India. Chatamari reminds me of a crispy dosa with an omelette attached to it. \\n\\nWe have already been here twice and are looking forward to ordering more take out here in the future.

Veracruz stands out in a sea of Tex-Mex offerings in the Austin area, serving Mexican food that is hearty and simple. \\n\\nThe food here is inspired by the Veracruz region of Mexico from which the owner (Reyna Vasquez) hails. As an added bonus, and as the name would suggest, everything you'll enjoy here is made from scratch using fresh all natural ingredients, from the tortillas to the squeeze bottle sauces available for a few added kicks of heat or flavor. Their drink options range from juices to smoothies and aguas frescas rather than soda or alcohol. It's the kind of place where the menu speaks to meat eaters and vegetarians alike and makes both equally happy and satisfied. \\n\\nThe migas originales I ordered is from the breakfast taco menu, which is Veracruz' claim to fame. When you unwrap this you'll find a thick flour tortilla containing a layer of fluffy eggs, avocado, cheese, pico de gallo, and tortilla strips for added crunch. This was a first for me, someone who regularly enjoys street tacos in the San Diego region featuring meats or Baja-style fish. I found this to be delicious and satisfying in a different way, with the egg and avocado serving as a formidable and filling base.\\n\\nIf you get your food 'for here' you'll be dining al fresco at fenced-in picnic tables. For added fun swarms of charming grackle birds will circle around sounding like kazoos while you eat your food hunched over to keep them from flying off with your lunch or attacking your mini sauce containers. Despite the birds and the cold weather on the day that I visited, the tables were full of what I perceived to be repeat visitors, given their familiarity with the menu, food, and drinks. \\n\\nWhat began as one taco trailer has expanded into a mini-empire, with the popularity of Veracruz and its solid food options resulting in additional trucks as well as brick-and-mortar stores. The restaurants and other trailers around town all have slightly varying menus, giving fans a reason to rotate among their locations. I highly recommend a visit to enjoy some of the best Mexican food I sampled on a visit to Austin."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere is beautiful.

They are ordinary. Anyone can make them at home. I've had far better tacos elsewhere, even at home. Homemade guacamole is much better as well. However the plaintains and corn (not on the cob but in bowl) were amazing- I loved these. I definitely want to learn to make the corn at home. \\n\\nValet parking is complimentary. No charge.

There are so many people jumping in for the wrong reasons (ie: just to make money). With mediocre food, carnival food, gimmicky food, gimmicky names... hundreds of carts have diluted what used to be a pool of very talented folks doing edgy things, may with fresh local ingredients, street-side. Don't get me wrong, even in the past few years we've seen a few stand-out carts open up, but so many, many, many more that are simply not great at all.\\n\\nAnd that's why I get so stoked when I find something like PDX Six Seven One. While this cart may be new(ish), to me it represents that same glimmer that came with the early adopters in the cart scene. Here is someone doing some ethnic food that's majorly under-represented in Portland. Not only that, but the flavor combinations here are very tasty. The ingredients seem to be of decent quality. The cart is clean (you can tell the owner cares about it). But most of all, this is food I'd be satisfied with in a restaurant. \\n\\nI had the distinct pleasure of sampling a couple of the dishes from this cart. First, and most impressive to me, was the K√©laguen Mannok, which consists of \\"grilled chicken, chopped and mixed with lemon, grated coconut, peppers and onions served cold and spicy.\\" The dish comes with your choice of rice or Titiyas - hand-made coconut milk flatbread, grilled to order. This meal is both delicious and healthful (except the flatbread). There's something about cold chopped chicken dressed with spicy, tangy, and hot. I guess it reminds me of some of my favorite SE Asian foods. It's a simple salad comprised of the ingredients listed above, chopped/diced into a bowl. The flavors are deep and very S. Pacific. The lemon and coconut mix well with onions and spicy little peppers. This dish has a lot of latent fresh pepper heat, which I really like (but left my Mantern sweating and fanning his face). The heat is offset by the almost-sweet coconut flat bread (which is fantastic of itself). \\n\\nThis little bowl will run you $7.75. But I feel that it's totally worth it. And it's a nice departure from the mostly fattening, indulgent, gluttonous meals that most carts serve. Fact is, there are fewer and fewer carts I can dine at if I am going to be honest about being even somewhat healthy. But here I could eat almost every day. Well, not the second dish I sampled - the shrimp and vegetable fritters. These little pockets of deliciousness are exactly what you'd expect - cornmeal dough studded with chunks of shrimp, peas and carrots and deep fried to a golden brown. Rich and tasty, dip these suckers in Cocksauce and go to town. \\n\\nI've never been to Guam, so I can't tell you if this food is \\"traditional\\" or anything like that. What I can tell you is that the dishes I've sampled (one of which seems to be the signature dish) are delicious. And on top of that, they're not greasy piles of [take your pick - meat/cheese/bread/fries/burritos/padthai]. I will definitely be back.

I was raised in an Spanish/Cuban family and sangr√≠a was normal on Sundays for us. This was closer to an American fruit punch with a tilt to cranberry. I requested to change it or fix it but second pitcher was just a little better. THE WORST PART; SENDING THE MANAGER TO MY TABLE QUESTIONING WHY I DID NOT LIKE THE SANGR√çA??!! I even doubt if it was changed at all but I gave up. Then we ordered jam√≥n serrano, Italian smoked ham and manchego cheese. That was very fine. The biggest problem was getting someone to bring a dessert to my son and sing along with us happy birthday. The main reason I picked Barcelona was because I have saw this happening there many times. This request took forever and the place was almost empty. I kept calling it and the stress was accumulating in me since my family was asking already; why we don't leave? As a tapas bar restaurant Barcelona doesn't have desserts on the menu, but the kitchen sent a beautiful wooden cutting-table with flan and crepes on it. Nonetheless, the waitress made all efforts to ruin our event. Seemly upset, she left the dessert on the table avoiding eye contact, running back and leaving us singing alone.

The quantity was limited to two pieces which was a little odd since we were three of us. For the main course l, we ordered tibs with salmon and lamb as meat - miser and potato beets salad as sides. We also got a bowl of rice and enjera along with it. The lamb was cooked really well and salmon was out of this world. Enjera with miser is a really good combination and would highly recommend it.

Raw beef, well-seasoned, topped with a 6 minute boiled egg with slightly runny yolk.  The tartare can get messy.  Half of the beef fell out of my bun after my first bite into this burger.

Excellent presentation, but mediocre compared to the tuna tartare at some other restaurants.  3.5 stars.\\n\\nThe music is very loud, and the decor is modern, yuppie, and chic.

A great choice, considering I had missed Chef Marla's famous cassoulet- a winter specialty that I think has lamb and perhaps another meat with some vegetables in a sauce and baked in a homemade pastry.  I'll be sure to get that next winter.\\n\\nThe sides are worth mentioning because you can tell a great deal of loving care goes into the sourcing and preparation of each vegetable. \\n\\nAfter leaving, I went home, collected Clay and brought him back to experience this great restaurant.

I did not understand why didn't someone proactively come over to tell us the situation but instead made us wait for over 35 minutes for our food. Eventually our food did arrive and the burger was so bland and overcooked so I didn't even finish it. To make the situation worse, we spent another 20 minutes looking for our server but we didn't see him so once again we had to ask another server to find him. Our server and the manager came over and all they asked was how was the food, make sure we come back again and dropped off the check.

I really do my best to have kindness when I make these reviews. I've worked the food industry, I currently work customer service so most of the time I understand. Although it's in this instance that I really don't. I had scheduled an order earlier in the day to be made and/or delivered (the website didn't specify which) at 6:30 being there was a chance I wasn't going to be home until then to receive it. Luckily both my roommate and I were home at 5:45 when it and the cheese sticks were delivered... cold. Not my favorite but something a microwave or oven can easily fix. What was a bigger problem was the toppings and base used on the pizza. I had opted out something's for others due to dietary restrictions. What I had specified in the order form was clearly not what was on my pizza. So, I called and to see what happened. When I spoke to the manager and asked for clarification as to why my pizza was delivered early and why what I had put on the form (after I had looked it over again to make sure I wasn't the one who had made the mistake) wasn't what I received I was told they can't see any of that, it wasn't their fault, that I was lying and it wasn't there problem. He offered in store credit but that's not what I want. I want my concerns to be heard and validated. Instead he brushed them under the rug so I said my goodbyes and hung up. Mistakes happen but calling a customer a liar is not one. It really sucks.

My usual order is the Classic burger with cheese and extra sauce (I like them sassy!), truffle fries, and a red velvet milkshake. My tummy is always happy and full when I leave! Of course, on a busy day, the line can wrap around the building. Honestly though, the wait is not that bad, and they usually have people taking drink orders, so you can enjoy a beer or a milkshake in line! Their system is pretty efficient as well. You wait in line and as you get closer, someone takes your order on a tablet. Another person finds and numbers a table for your party, and then you get to the register to cash out. Once you sit, your food comes out in minutes! Everyone that works here is very friendly as well. \\n\\nOverall, this is one of the best places to eat in Austin.

The location is now a place you can hit up in the morning for your coffee, swing by for some really decent fare for lunch, and then come back to for drinks in the evening. Perhaps the most striking change is the transformation from a fairly dark building to one that is almost shockingly white and true blue (but it works).\\nAs for what they offer, I was generally impressed. Bear in mind that this particular establishment has only been open about a month so I haven't yet had the chance to try everything. The kale caesar I ordered was really tasty. Normally, I might pass over a caesar salad but I was drawn to it because I had figured out that Stinson's makes all their dressings in-house. Their small salads, which register at less than $4 would just about suffice for a lunch for one. Add on a side if you think you're a bit hungrier. Or do what I did--throw on a small pizza. It seemed as though there was no place in Austin to find deep dish pizza but, with Stinson's, you can get your fix of cheese and sauce. I'm no deep dish pizza expert but I was pleasantly surprised.\\nPerhaps the best part about this location is building's deck. It's tucked away on the side of the building so you're not facing the road. It's also above the tree line as the bluff descends down to Ladybird Lake so you can catch a glimpse of it. All-in-all, I expect that Stinson's will become a neighborhood establishment in its own right in the near future."},{"name":"Dancing Goats Coffee Bar","address":"419 W Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"This is your neighborhood downtown Decatur, Seattle Based coffee shop, and it's not a Starbucks or a Seattles best coffee?! *gasp*.

It's cafeteria style as you go thru the stations and indicate what you'd like.  The staff was VERY helpful and ever so patient.  I tend to get overwhelmed with smells, sites and anticipation.  I was so excited I forgot to grab a piece of cornbread...darn!!  Anyhow, once I made it to the meat station, paralysis really set in.  Everything looked AMAZING!!!  I ultimately ordered the jalapeno cheese sausage, brisket (of course) and pulled pork.  I also really wanted to try the beef rib (since the reviews insisted on it) and the gal indicated one rib is $24 more or less and is huge.  Oh no....what to do?  I asked to see one....she pulled one out, unwrapped it and in showing it to me, half the meat fell off the bone.  She said she'll just give that meat to me as she now can't sell that rib  EUREKA!!!!  Life couldn't be better.  The food did not disappoint.  I've been experimenting with brisket at home so paid special attention to the piece on my plate.  It was perfect!!!  The crust had great flavor and texture while the meat itself was very moist.  The beef rib you ask?  OMG....it was the highlight.  Now I understand past reviews.  I intended to go back just for that, but ran out of time.  I did go to a very well known bbq place that night for dinner.......that I was a fan of with past trips to Austin.

Her decaf came out first so she took her coffee and went to find a table.

The lady behind the bar rolled her eyes at me but agreed to remake the mocha.  After a couple mins she passed it over to the guy at the front and he again said \\"decaf mocha\\".  Then I was confused again because I said again that I didn't want a decaf mocha.  She again scoffed, and shook her head and said rudely that the FIRST one was regular and the second one was made with decaf.  Then she explained when they say \\"decaf mocha\\" it actually means \\"the mocha that was ordered with the decaf\\".  That's kind of stupid.  The decaf coffee was long gone.  Why even mention the word \\"decaf\\" for the mocha as well?  Anyways I didn't want to wait a 3rd time so just took it as is.  The mocha tasted ok, but I was most disappointed with the barista lady at the back that rolled her eyes and shook her head.  That was not necessary. If she knew the first one was actually correct (not decaf), why not just say so?  Then everything would have been fine!

I think the one thing I am disappointed about is that if you don't do the add-ons, it's really just noodles, soup, and a slice of meat. The add-ons do get a bit expensive as you add up the price. \\n\\nThe noodles were cooked perfectly to my liking, and the broth was very flavorful.

An hour later... YOU FEEL MISERABLE because the food is INCREDIBLE and you realize that your eyes were WAY BIGGER than your stomach!.. But wait, you're not done yet... You then ask the server to pack you a cream puff to go (because you wanted one, but now you can fit it in).

The server made me feel better and said she sometimes just starts laughing when she eats things at Barley Swine)... all the things are excellent.\\n\\nThe one 'problem' but really it's just a 'consistency', is that most of the dishes follow the same pattern/idea: an unexpected puree or cream (garlic creme fraiche? popcorn puree? what?) topped with a delectable three-bite morsel of meat or seafood or fruit or vegetable (in summer, grilled, in winter, roasted) and scattered with delightful dollops of condiments and herbs or greens (an egg-yolk custard that looks just like an egg yolk and tastes like concentrated egg yolk, the green bean salad).  You take tiny forkfuls of each sauce, savoring the simplicity, then start digging in and making your own combinations.\\n\\nYes.  Go.

If you read anything about this restaurant, it's this: they do NOT have a tasting menu of any sort, regardless of what the waitress says!\\n\\nI had originally been recommended this restaurant for their tasting menu. I did read online that they no longer have a tasting menu, but I wanted to be sure, so I called in and checked. They said they still have it, but it's not exactly the same as before. However, the price point was still $60-70 a person depending on what's ordered, some of the dishes would be on the menu, and some not depending on what the kitchen had that day. She quoted that we could share a few appetizers, pastas, main, and dessert. That sounded fine to me, so I decided to go for my birthday dinner.\\n\\nThen, once seated at the restaurant, I again asked the waitress about their tasting menu. She explained pretty much the same thing, making it sound like they have a tasting menu still available and we could list our preferences on what we saw on their regular menu that seemed interesting, and then the kitchen would decide what else to add to the menu. She quoted 3 appetizers, 2 pastas, 1 main, 1 dessert to share between 3 people. We chose 2 appetizers and the main. She said we might get a different special main from the kitchen (we did not). I wish I had chosen more, because when the bill came, it turns out they just ordered us items off the regular menu and it was pretty much exactly the same as if we'd have chosen the items, except they chose 1 appetizer, 2 pastas, and 1 dessert to serve to us. If they were more transparent on what their \\"tasting menu\\" was actually, I would have just gone and ordered things that I wanted to have. We did not get 1 dish that was not available on the regular menu.\\n\\nI wish I had listened to the reviews that warned me that there was no tasting menu. The restaurant sounds like they have a new alternative \\"tasting menu\\" to answer for why they don't have one any more. I'd rather just have them be open and transparent, then we would have ordered all of the dishes we preferred.\\n\\nOkay, so that explains why 1 star down. On to the food!\\n\\nAll of the dishes were very tasty, with the exception of the dessert. They had a prosciutto and burrata appetizer ($25) on special which I highly recommend. They fly their burrata fresh in from Italy. It's so soft and delicious. We also had their parmesan souffles ($16 each) which were SO good, light, fluffy, and tasty. We tried their butter lettuce wedge salad ($15), which was also very fresh, crisp, and delightful. Then, we had their spinach dumplings ($23). Not something I'd normally order, and value wise, not something I'd get again. It comes with 4 pieces. The taste was good, very carb loaded. The second pasta we had was the Maltagliani all'americano ($23). The sauce was really good, so flavourful, and the pasta was fresh and had a good bite. We then had 2 portions of the hangar steak main ($34 each). This was a generous portion, with lots of pieces of well-cooked steak and a nice arugula salad. I did find they were quite generous with the cheese in all of the dishes that had cheese. Lastly, they served us a chocolate cake with poached pear for dessert ($10). This was the most disappointing finish to our meal, as this was not only dry, but there was not much chocolate flavour. It wasn't a very decadent dessert, it almost tasted store-bought. Definitely do not recommend this cake, so minus another star.\\n\\nOverall, if you go in ordering the dishes you actually want to try, and avoid their \\"tasting menu\\", I think you'd have a great time. The flavours for their dishes (in exception of the chocolate cake) are really good. If only I had gone with ordering dishes on my own, I would have had a much better experience. I might be back as I hear their lasagna is amazing, and there were a few dishes that were very good. But for sure I do not recommend their tasting menu, and likely won't be back soon."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My very first stop while visiting Austin and what a fantastic first impression it gave me! After reading other reviews, I decided that this would be my brisket tasting despite having to wait in line. And yes, on a Sunday afternoon I waited outside in line for about 40 minutes for this meal. WORTH IT. They have water outside for free while you wait and you can also order a beer or soda to enjoy while you wait in line. The best part was that no one seemed frustrated or cranky. Everyone was there because they knew the wait was worth the quality of the meal. \\n\\nI ordered a 1/4 lb. of the beef brisket, a 5 oz. macaroni & cheese and two fresh jalape√±os. I grabbed a local craft beer (all beer is $4.75!!!!) as well. They sell two kinds of margaritas up front while you wait in line as well. The line is cafeteria style and you have plenty of time to make your choice while you wait. Sides first, meat at the register and they cut it right in front of you. This stuff is legit hot, fresh and juicy. Free pickles, onions, hot sauce, bbq sauce and sliced bread after you pay. My meal (with beer) was $15 and I was beyond happy to give them my money. This was the most tender meat I may have ever had in my life. It cut like butter and the crust was divine (I was lucky enough to get an end piece...DROOL). The mac & cheese was anything but dry, with big noodles and plenty of cheese. I ate it ALL and took a 6 mile walk around Austin afterward because I was so full that sitting down hurt. \\n\\nSeating can be hard to find so be prepared to sit outside in the sun or wait for a bit inside for someone to leave. People do come and go quickly and much of the line is people getting food to go. The parking lot is the same story. I was lucky to get a spot pretty quickly. I would not think that this would be a good place to take a group, although there was a bachelorette party there when I stopped by. \\n\\nOverall: Be patient, it's worth the wait.

Well first of all, because the menu is created by so many top chefs by so many different restaurants, its hard to say Parish has a \\"best of\\" sandwich. It all depends on who you're talking to. For me, I had the \\"benny\\" which basically came down to a fancy vietnamese sandwich. By fancy I mean TASTY, and AWESOME, and FANTASTIC.\\n\\nIts like a super fresh super flavorful version of the $3 version in Chinatown. The subtle spicy flavor of the chicken, the creamy mayo like sauce that coats and softens the fresh and fill-your-nostrils-with-fresh-frenchness french roll, and the light red cabbage slaw are all executed perfectly. If I could, I'd take the sauce that comes on the sandwich and put it on anything - its just that damn good.\\n\\nWe also had the Nicoise Salad, which was fresh and chock full of greens, and topped with a seared tuna (although I didn't think the tuna was executed very well - the flesh was grey instead of pink, and the seasoning as too light). \\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere of Parish won't blow you away. The service won't impress you. The outside of the restaurant isn't memorable. But the uniqueness of the sandwiches and the sheer magnitude of the big-name chefs who are all over this menu make Parish Cafe the type of place that you end up saying \\"I went to this one place, it was damn good, but what was the name of the place?

I will not give out his name, only because I will be requesting him every time I go in and don't want his section to be filled. I'm selfish like that. He made a suggestion to my friend for a bottle of red before I arrived. I will admit that I'm not a fan of red, so I was not all that excited she ordered a bottle for us to share. The waiter must have some amazing psychic ability along with his exceptional service and care. I very much enjoyed the red and even thought of ordering a second bottle! He also noticed my not so fabulous attempts at speaking Italian and inquired about it. I am learning and love to practice. He offered to practice with me and spent the next several minutes talking to me in Italian while I translated to English for the table. That is WAY above and beyond just being a waiter.\\n\\nFinally the food. There is nothing that can be said. It was enough to get me dancing in my chair for most of the meal. Even the dressing on the salad was delicious. The ravioli was a pumpkin for the daily special. Now I'll say this next part slowly so you can experience it with me. Brown... Butter.... Sauce. Wow! Just thinking about it now is making me hungry. I had the chicken as my entree. It was rolled with prosciutto and cheese with a side of mashed potatoes and spinach with garlic. All very delicious. We also had dessert. I had the tiramisu, while my friend had the apple ravioli (which was fried and drizzled with caramel), and my date had profiteroles. I also had an espresso.

It was quite nice on the inside. It was around 7:30-8pm and the band was just tuning up and getting ready to start, so I asked to be seated as far as possible (had a couple of septuagenarians with us).  This is my only ding on the entire experience---- they put us in the corner where I asked but rather than pulling a table up to make proper room for a party of 6, they turned a 4 top sideways and left one of us (ME) on the end sitting out in the pathway 2 feet from the bathroom doors- luckily no aromas or noises! To be fair, the band was quite good, as the young woman had a soulful voice and I really dig the steel guitar (I didn't catch their name). The food was great and exemplified PNW public house fare - fresh and very tasty and homey. Everyone enjoyed their food and left with empty plates and full bellies. I can't remember what everyone ate  - I was one of the 2 fish and chips - fresh tasting and a delicious and light beer batter, a HUGE chicken sandwich (my father in-law told me it was delicious- and really moist).  I was the only drinker and had a mango cider- it was ok but sweet (if you carry only 1 cider, make sure it is tart and apple!!!), and a lager that was really good.

So I was hopeful that this sign was a thing of the past.\\n\\nThe bartender, a female, was cordial. However, I noticed that the server stations were located behind the bar & there was an iPad or two being used. My biggest concern was exactly what happened -the bartender stepped away (because she did not write my order down) to ask me for a second time what I ordered. At that moment, a waitress with blond hair starts typing in an order. I immediately saw problems with this. Bartenders need their own station & servers need their own. Just old school waiter tips.\\n\\nNegatives: There was a young guy --employee--who apparently was there to get that money. He actually said he had 2 1/2 hours to go. I interpreted that as I looked on that he needed tasks to do. Thankfully a server came by and followed up with the bartender's suggestion that he asked everyone if they needed water. I sat at the bar and was not offered a water by anyone. He was told to do that twice. He was also told to clean up tables. He definitely was a novice at feeling the crowd and what they needed.\\n\\nThe food: I honestly can say that the wings were above board & so were the shrimp. However, the portion size -5 shrimp & 3 wings was way too small for the price. Unfortunately, the egg rolls tasted funny to me. They just didn't seem fresh. I'm sorry but I threw them out.\\n\\nI am not a person that lives on absolutes. I believe I will give the restaurant a second chance. It is my hope that they make improvements.

He explained it he could only serve it in his shell and that he would be unable to pull the lobster from the shells, so I said okay. After all the work the lobster was like rubber. They were kind enough to switch for crab, the crab tasted excellent inside, but they were skinny pieces in a lot of work to get into.

I was looking to try out a restaurant that I hadn't yet eaten at in the North End tonight. Came across this place and moseyed inside. The interior had a warm, welcoming vibe. Like most North End restaurants, this place is small. I'd guesstimate a seating capacity of around 25. Brick walls, wood shelves and tables provided a cozy feel. I sat at one of two bars. \\n        I asked what they had for non-alcoholic cocktails. I was given a list of sodas. Apparently they don't do \\"mocktails.\\" I started off with the fried artichoke hearts. This was the highlight of the meal. Crispy and full of flavor. They were accompanied by some salad greens olives and a pepperoncini and a drizzle of what I think may have been some type of feta dressing. I could have ordered two or three more and made a meal out of this appetizer!\\n       For the entree, I ordered the Braciolettini di Vitello, veal cutlets stuffed with parmesan cheese and wrapped with prosciutto over spinach fettuccine and an eggplant, mushroom tomato sauce. It had a slight smoked flavor (from the prosciutto maybe??) that I wasn't crazy about and end portions of the veal were on the tough side. Not my favorite but because of the artichoke hearts, all is forgiven. (But It didn't stop me from bringing the leftovers home for a midnight snack). The specials for the night all sounded good.

We asked others in line if they were in line for food and this was there first time as well so they weren't sure. After waiting and watching people go inside we asked someone at the front desk and she said no the line starts inside for food. However, they have a window outside where you can buy alcohol while you're waiting in line and that confused a lot of people. You go by the same bar at the entrance as well. Once we got line it was very long and a few people that were waiting behind us decided to leave after seeing the length. We are glad we stayed because it really didn't take long to get our food.

I called the store and very politely gave my name and my order and was told I can come back to the store and receive my drink (my name was going to be written down). This afternoon I finally had a chance to stop by, once getting up to the pick up window I let the woman know my name and that I was told I can be compensated for the mistake. From the start she immediately rolled her eyes and raised her arms and proceeded to ask a co worker if they knew anything about the situation. She came back to the window claiming there was no name written down and can not go around giving away free things, stated \\"People can say anything \\". I asked for the DM , she hesitated and let me know I can call the store tomorrow. I asked for a second time and she gave me the name, but stated I did not need to know her name(which aren't we suppose to be wearing name tags)?

We were excited to step out for a great evening at Wilfs & enjoy one of our favorite musicians, Tony Pacini. Did it work out like that?? HEAVENS, NO! NOT even close!!!!\\n\\nWe were very undeservedly & rudely mistreated by the ma√Ætre d' because of his apparent confusion as to what the situation for cover charges & two evening shows was going to be. We were asked to leave our seats at the bar because there were supposedly people waiting with reservations - in a bar that is first-come, no reservations taken!?! He poked my bf sharply on the shoulder & rudely asked him to pay our bill & leave!\\n\\nWHAT?!? When we gladly left after being spoken to so disrespectfully, there was NO ONE waiting in the lobby to get in! It was almost 10:30 - no one else was coming in. Many people had already left & those there were settling in for the rest of the evening. Our \\"rude dude\\" was in such a hurry to get more people seated, he apparently didn't notice the food & drink service had slowed way down & people were just enjoying the music. We would have bought a couple more drinks had we stayed.\\n\\nWe spent a lot of money & left with a very bitter taste, a ruined New Year's Eve & will gladly tell others of our lousy time @Wilfs - never to return. Which is really disappointing - it's a nice room and the music by Tony Pacini & trio with Rebecca Kilgore was wonderful.\\n\\nBut we couldn't enjoy it after Sherman ruined our evening with his rude attitude. Server Michelle attempted to smooth things over (thank you!), but it was too late. He had some crazy idea about charging us (and another couple at the bar), a second $15 cover charge & a second $20 bar tab minimum, per person. If there were to be charges for a second show, it was NOT mentioned anywhere: on the website, on the phone or when we first arrived.\\n\\nBooted out on the street @10:30 on NY's Eve!!! Now what?? We didn't want to go somewhere else & pay yet another cover charge & bar minimum. Our evening was ruined by an establishment that fancies itself \\"high class\\"? Hardly! \\n\\nActually, the evening started out on a sour note. There were several empty tables in the bar area where supposedly no reservations were taken. Those tables remained unoccupied until later in the evening. Meanwhile, we were seated at \\"Table X\\" near the kitchen & bathroom traffic areas. Excuse us for not wanting to buy the pre-fixe dinner. But the $35 minimum per person should be sufficient to warrant a decent seat & respect as paying customers. Two waitresses were kind enough to find us seats at the bar when two became available. The food choices beyond the dinner menu were nothing to write home about & my wine pours were really stingy. \\n\\nEven people who bought dinner got moved out quickly. There was a young couple celebrating their 7th anniversary who got bumped from their dinner table. They lingered around the bar area & found new seats. That is until \\"Mr. Rude\\" told them to get up! They left soon after, no doubt disappointed. How many others felt stranded after spending a good chunk of change & then had to leave? \\n\\nThe management needs to take better care of their customers if they expect to have repeat business. We've been to Wilfs several times & enjoy the ambiance of the room & the caliber of performers.

As we walked around, a sudden dash of rain and massive wind hurled us into the nearest church where we found another group of people huddled away from the turn of elemental events.\\n\\nFire and Ice had an hour wait plus I was not really looking forward to a buffet since I've been doing nothing but eating horribly  my entire stay here so I actually was looking for a salad.  In addition, they had overbooked my flight so I was stuck in MA until Monday (I refused to waste a Sunday on standby) so the boys took me to Whiskey's for a quick bite and Steve was looking for a burrito place.\\n\\nFirst off, since it is a bar, they verified my old bag age by looking at my id.  And the blast of sound and hot air hit me in the stomach.  It was loud.  And the crowd here was mixed in a pleasing way.  A bunch of financial suits lined one end of the bar in their dark navy and bright yellow ties.  On the other end, were a bunch of Red Sox fans becoming boisterous in their jeans and sweaters.  Seated throughout the banquettes, were families and random people escaping the sudden downpour.\\n\\nOur waiter showed up in a funky wig full of black ringlets and a boxing outfit.  I tried hard not to laugh, even though I was on a call trying to obtain reservations at the local Holiday Inn Express for the night.  $250.\\n\\n???\\n\\nFor a Holiday Inn??  Forget about it.\\n\\nI ordered a Midori sour, which appeared in the form of a half pint.  Sweet yet potent.

My Midori was $6.00.  The salad was a good sized portion, with a good Caesar dressing.  I ate the entire thing and left the croutons circling the rim of the plate.\\n\\nWe left, feeling a bit warmer and I was on the line with CSAA attempting to obtain a better quote in terms of reservations.

Lemme 'splain it to you.\\n\\nI have been excited to try Barley Swine for a looong time.  I went in, armed with all kinds of Yelp knowledge on how to deal with the wait and how much to order, etc.  And the fact that we ended up waiting THREE HOURS for a table, is not why I'm giving them only two stars.  It's the wait to deliciousness ratio that is out of kilter.  I wanted to be balown away by the food after proving to BS that I wanted it so bad to wait 3 hours for it.  Simply stated, I was not.\\n\\nLemme give you the details which may or may not help you in your own BS adventure (this will be about as long as our wait, so go pee first).  Sighting the place is the first hurdle.  Look for the La Feria sign.  BS is the non-descript turd brown building under it.  You can then circle the tight parking lot for a bit before convincing yourself you will have to park on the neighborhood street a block away (some of our party parked at La Feria and were not towed).  \\n\\nWe knew, with a party of 7, that there would be a wait.  Hell, with a party of two there's always a wait.  So our genius plan was to get there at 6:30, put our names in and expect to eat around 8 or so.  The very nice hostess took my phone number and said it would probably be about an hour and a half, as we expected. We then traipsed over to the Horseshoe Lounge.  That's entirely another review but suffice to say they only serve beer there (unless you count that nasty hard tea, blech).  We wanted wine and liquor so we then moseyed down to Black Sheep Lodge.  About 8:45 we checked our dedication.  Were we willing to wait all nite??  Yes.  Yes we were dammit.  They called at 9 to come back.  Unfortunately the ladies at \\"our\\" table could not feel our stinkeye and just lingered over their wine another 30 minutes.  We were slightly distracted and amused by the presence of Drew Barrymore sitting very close to us, so we weren't at all grumpy about the wait.  (BIG TIP:  make sure you have great company.  It makes the wait bearable and almost pleasurable).\\n\\nAs recommended by the BS expert (yes Errol, that's you), we ordered pretty much everything on the menu, from scallops with pork head to melon with trout roe.  From beef tongue to rabbit terrine to redfish.  And from chocolate fudge with marshmallows and salted caramel ice cream, to a sage funnel cake with foie gras and butternut squash ice cream.  \\n\\nYes, everything was.....interesting.  Thought provoking, maybe.  But it really didn't wow me.  In my head, I kept comparing this to a great sushi restaurant, like Uchiko, where all the simple yet daring components come together to excite the palate, where you can separate each component on your tongue and then swirl them all together for a whole new flavor explosion.  At BS, this didn't happen for me.  The components either all bled together (salty pork on salty scallops) or were too contrasted (smokey fishy roe on sweet melon).  The only thing that worked for me was the fudge dessert, but then anything with salted caramel in the description is a winner.\\n\\n Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough?  But I loved Odd Duck on the other hand....maybe this incarnation is just trying too hard.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, maybe Drew Barrymore got all the good stuff.\\n\\nIt took us another THREE HOURS to eat our meal.  And it wasn't like we were trying to linger either.   That's just the pace BS set for us, which explains the horrid wait times.  \\n\\nI told myself that this is how the Europeans do it....but in reality, this is Texas, I'd been up since 5 a.m. with no siesta, and honestly the food wasn't worth it.  Thankfully, the company was.\\n\\n(for the record, my hubby and I argued over giving 2 or 3 stars.  His argument was \\"They didn't serve us BAD food.  It just wasn't great.\\"  MY argument is, it's all apples and oranges.  If someone can give a chain steakhouse 5 stars cause it's the best steak for the value that you can get compared to other chain steakhouses, that's legit.  Barley Swine would be on the short comparison list to fancy, expensive  places like Uchi/Uchiko or Ruth Chris, etc.  As a comparison, then, yes I've experienced better.  I told hubby to shut up and get his own Yelp account.)"},{"name":"Kits Sushi","address":"1518 Yew Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Pretty average sushi and fairly bland miso soup.

There is no sign regarding seating, as in \\"please wait to be seated\\" or anything of that nature. We saw menus on clean tables, so figured we would just take a seat. About 10 minutes later no one had spoken to us. We figured we were wrong about seating ourselves. So, we stood in line, at which point a younger gentlemen asked if he could start a drink for us. I responded yes, but that we were eating in. At this point he looked annoyed and said, \\"ok, then take a seat and someone will be with you.\\"\\n\\nThere was a loud table of three in the center of the main dining area that literally had four out of the 6 present staff members tending to it.

My fianc√© ordered the avocado hollandaise breakfast sandwich, which was minuscule in size. I ended up sharing my sandwich with him, because he was going to order something else.

The first time I sat by the open window to enjoy the breeze and people walking by with a Moscow mule to drink. The first experience we had the macaroni and cheese, pasta salad, fried whiting, and the egg rolls. Our favorite out of the bunch was definitely the pasta salad. A little surprised the fried fish was only one piece for the size of it so I would highly recommend adding at least one more piece to the serving. The second visit we sat at the bar and enjoyed a nice mimosa and started with the fried okra, egg rolls and pasta salad again. (As you can see, the pasta salad is a favorite item) We ventured out and also tried the crab fried rice which was pretty dry and not as moist as I was told but it was still good. Lastly, the fried pork chop with gravy on the side was yummy. It was filled with flavors and filling. Overall, Virgil's is a great atmosphere to grab some drinks and some tapas. Now if we can get valet for parking - it will be perfect!

For a dine in burger place service was very fast. Hostess was amazing. The first thing I ordered was a boozy milk shake which wasn't really blended funny so it was a chunk of ice cream just sitting there. Didn't finish that. Then I ordered the Nutella and toasted marshmallow milkshake which I LOVED ! My kids had grilled cheese and fries that they loved. I made a burger and for the cucumber lovers this is the place to be. Cucumbers was def a vegetable topping. It was one of the best burgers I ever had. I had a Vietnamese chicken wings and it was good. The only thing I didn't like but because of management I didn't give a 3 stars was the macaroni. It had no flavor. It had gruyere cream and chopped back and I assumed it would be packed with flavor. Sadly it was not . I even tried adding salt and to no avail. But it was removed from my check so that was a plus and brought back up there score to a 4 star place.

The Spinach & Chickpea Cazuela was equally as fantastic. It consisted of tender spinach and chickpeas in a savory, thick stock. Two of my favorite things in one dish? Say no more, tbh.

They also were super helpful with using our groupon and explained everything it allowed at the beginning of the meal.\\n\\nOne thing we both appreciated is that the portion size is REASONABLE.

There was not a single thing I wouldn't recommend! Everything was very flavorful, although I might even be daring and get \\"medium\\" spice level next time.  I'm never sure if mild means there is already a bit of spice, as I have witnessed at some places, so I played it safe, and there was really no heat at all (which was fine, but just for those wondering)\\n\\nBased on these great experiences, I really was underwhelmed by the lunch buffet.  I have only been once, and $10 for free tea and all you can eat, is nothing to sneeze at, but it just didn't feel like there was a lot of variety. I filled up on Samosas.  Also- when they set up the buffet it takes up basically the entire restaurant, which created some difficulties with accommodating mobility equipment, but the staff really made great efforts, it's just a really small building, and I feel like there are better ways they could utilize the space during this time.  \\n\\nI would go back, now that I know the full potential of their menu, but I much prefer having the options of their whole menu, and not just a couple of selected dishes.

Typically this is one of the spicier dishes I thought...  Zero heat.  There's also was a squash, zuchini vegetarian dish which was pretty bland and uninteresting and some grilled chicken and onions which also was pretty bland and had no sauce or noticeable spice and very little seasoning.  \\nAside from that there are 2 soups and salad section and thats really it.  About 1/2 the items to choose from as the Bombay Bistro I went to over the weekend, which I preferred.\\n\\nThe naan is also on the undercooked chewy side.  I like it with a little bit of char crunch on the outside with a soft chewy inside, and this was just basically a soft pita all the way around with no char as if it were cooked in a regular low temp oven.  \\n\\nOverall, the price is pretty good for the buffet, but what you pay for is lack of selection.

We have been ordering from Castello's for years and have always loved it but recently we experienced an incredibly bad situation with an employee and literally have been on the hunt searching for a new local place! On a busy Saturday evening we called and ordered several pizzas and 20 hot wings for a family of 7 kids and there were 4 adults. When everything arrived, we immediately noticed the wings were plain and dry and called to ask them to please send the right order, in fact, when I called FABIO answered and immediately recognized that he sent us the wrong order. They are literally a few blocks away and he offered to send the driver back with some sauce so that we could just toss them ourselves and it would only take a few minutes. I agreed but after 20 minutes went by, called back and asked for new wings. At this point, the wings were cold, kids and everyone else already ate their pizza because we could not hold them off  any longer and we just wanted them to make it right. FABIO was clearly agitated and asked again if he could just send the driver back and he was on his way already, he said they were too busy to deal with this and that the wings would be fine if I simply reheated them and tossed them myself. When I tried to explain that his solution did not help our situation and I did not want to pay for wings that I could not even eat with my meal and had to reheat and toss, he again was huffing on the phone and said he was too busy to deal with it. I told him I understood but I was the customer and they made the mistake, I let him know how loyal we were and how much we always enjoyed Castellos and gave him multiple chances to simply apologize, maybe offer me money back or any other solution other than making me feel bad for asking or continuing to wait for sauce. He started to argue with me and was very rude letting me know I did not understand how busy they were and when I asked him to replace the wings, he agreed but he wanted to charge me for them! Of course I said absolutely not and he explained that he would have to pay for the 20 wings out of his own pocket and he could not believe I would ask him to do this! This went on for about 10 solid minutes until he finally agreed but then said it wold be a long time because of how busy they were. I agreed and of course it was about an hour and a half and they arrived and I was not refunded for anything. At this point, we ate the pizza, wings went into the refrigerator and then to be honest, we were afraid to eat them because of the type of personality this gentleman had, I did not trust in the quality of the food he was now reluctantly delivering.

He single handedly is responsible for losing two customers so far and I am about to let my neighborhood know via our social media page as well as a local foodie forum which has more than 14,000 local foodie followers.

Ordered a breakfast sandwich to go and it was good but the way they packed it made it super sloppy and all the cheese went on one side.

The al pastor is delicious, breakfast tacos are good too. \\n\\nHaving said that, what really stands out to me as an underrated or underreported bright spot on their menu is their Torta with fajita steak. Wow! Great flavor, super tasty and honestly a better value at 8 bucks for a much larger and filling portion of food than a 3 dollar taco. It's definitely worth a try if you're looking for something new to try from a familiar Austin food truck/bus. I highly recommend it. \\n\\nAnother important thing I have to give them credit for. The offerings of salsa are all so good. That's one thing a lot of other places neglect; watery, bland and flavorless. Veracruz salsas are always well seasoned, with varying levels of heat, and they actually enhance and brighten the flavors of the food you put them on. \\n\\nI gotta ding one star on cleanliness, numerous times I've visited, the tables/eating are can be a little sticky and unkept. Salsa is kept in a small cooler, which I appreciate, but it can get a little messy sometimes as well. Parking can be really rough... not an exaggeration here. Their lot has like 6 spaces and seems to have been the victim of a meteor shower at some point. There are more potholes here than flat ground.

So I found Andiamo that was more central. 4 stars on Yelp so it had to be good. It's a hole in the wall. I've been to the Jack in the Box over there and the Pho restaurant which is right next door! But i never noticed Andiamo.\\n\\nFirst impression: looked like Bistro 88. Which means: no good! A bit '80's tacky decor. But we sat down.

It was actually really good.\\n\\nI ordered a glass of pinot grigio which was refreshing as well. So far, 2 for 2.\\n\\nThen the food came out. the portions were nice, but the presentation was very elementary school cafeteria style.\\n\\nFirst few bites of the beef were good. It was cooked well--tender. but there was something off about it. It was either frozen meat or just a bad cut. The flavors were pretty good, but as i continued to eat, the sauce (which was like salisbury steak) became heavier and heavier to the point that i wanted to barf.\\n\\nNow the risotto. Oh man...it was not good. First, they didn't use the correct rice. I think it was just asian rice which is longer and skinnier (not short/roundish). Also, the rice was undercooked. And finally, it was just mixed w/ cheese. So think of a bad mac and cheese and that's what it was.\\n\\nAt first, the beef was good, and the wine + bread made it pretty tolerable.

Since I don't eat beef, I usually ask any restaurant if they can make it with fish instead and some oblige and others don't because they're afraid the fish will fall apart. The dish took a while but the server advised of the delay which I appreciated. My love of this cuisine began over a decade ago when I would travel to Peru for work frequently so again happy this option exists here but nothing compares to the real \\"chichas\\" in Peru.

We ordered the tea-smoked spare ribs, pork and chive dumplings, Ming's market greens, and wok-charred udon noodles. This was plenty of food for three people. The spare ribs were delicious and fell right off the bone. I'm not a huge ribs person, but I thought that these were great. The pork and chive dumplings were also pretty good. The filling was delicious, although I would have liked a higher herbs-to-pork ratio. The daily market greens on Friday, June 29th, were yuchoy, a skinny rape stalk vegetable similar to Chinese broccoli, but more bitter (also known as choy sum). They were delicious and were served in a mysterious sauce; I could not call to mind what was in the sauce, but it was good. Finally, the crowning jewel of the menu-- the wok-charred udon noodles... were fantastic! The thick udon noodles were cooked with chicken, bok choy, and a sauce made of oyster sauce, black bean sauce, soy sauce, and Shaoxing in a wok at such a high temperature that they developed some caramelization.

Despite have had Ethiopian many times overs, this was an elevation of the cuisine and that is not just the Ethiopian beer talking, I really was glad they had a selection of a few Ethiopian beers it really does add to event although the Ice tea is equally good as it is spiced and amazing. \\nIf it is a nice Saturday evening and you find yourself here without a reservation and you are quoted a long wait time, you may be tempted to leave but look around and you will see a large gathering of people patiently waiting, join them because they know all its worth it.  \\nWe started with a gomen dip that was so unique and delicious, we called it wasabi tofu initially but that is an under simplification and it stole the show with its texture and the hints of ginger and garlic.\\nThe  menu has numerous treatments of protein tibs and wats as well as some of the most flavorful vegetarian dishes around, all served on a bed of injera. The injera here was a much milder form that I have had in the past with not as pronounced sourdough flavor to overwhelm the flavor profile of the of the various dishes.  I think this is why I liked this place so much. We honestly order way too much food but it was worth it.   The salmon and lamb tibs were just perfection and when you throw in the fact you can get filet mignon tibis this was a must a bust try. It really is a cut above the beef tibs (pun intended) as the wonderful oils from the meat just melt together wonderfully with the onions peppers and tomatoes. The lamb had the same effect and was equally impressive. The Salmon pieces were a great addition to give a bit of a different texture but still good they are well marinated and cooked well the tomatoes make it feel like it has been lightly stewed.\\nI have the feeling that I am forgetting something oh yeah your veggies, now these are some vegetarian dishes I can get behind. You have an excellent potato stew (Dinech wot), the great split pea stew (Ater), the collard (Gomen) and red lentil (Miser). These are just a few of the staples that we added to our platter. I honestly think nothing here can be bad. The staff was very friendly and helpful, its best to do your research and be ready to place your order, we never felt rush but we still inhaled our food mostly because it was that good.  All of the meats in fact were seasoned to perfection and they had jalape√±os in it for the always appreciated heat factor! \\n\\nP.S.

Just a burst or flavors and textures in your mouth. They had a scrambled egg dish that blew my mind. The cheesecake was extraordinary. They used roasted grains for texture and crunch. Few courses were fried fritters and salads. \\nThe last two dessert courses were mind blowing. I won't spoil it and they also keep changing the menu. But every dish was absolutely delicious. You could see the chefs working hard and the attention to detail is remarkable. \\nBarley swine is a great example of chefs who can cook, doesn't matter if they cook with vegetables or meat. \\nAnd talk about value; 13/14 courses for just $85pp. It was seriously a lot of food.

The chai had beautiful foam art, topped with cinnamon and was perfectly smooth and creamy. So delicious!  The Fricasse had braised short ribs and potatoes, arugula, two eggs, and cheese! The meat fell apart and the braising sauce was to DIE FOR. I was already pretty satisfied with my meal at this point, but the waffle with passionfruit cream was the perfect icing on the cake!  I think the waffles here are made with dough instead of batter because the consistency and flavor is on point. Based on the lack of conversation during our meal, my friends were pretty satisfied with their food as well.\\n\\nBesides the food, the customer service was excellent, shout out to Sebastian specfically!

Out of all their dressings, the creamy cilantro works best here.\\n\\nI used to use MealPass (now MealPal), where this was one of the favorites.

Our table for two was actually jammed into the doorway to the adjacent bar (Angel Face).  Considering Navarre was only half full,  it would have been nice not to have my neighbor's chair banging into mine, nor hear every word of their conversation.  There was a long, empty table for at least 8 sitting dormant the whole time I was squeezed into a ridiculously tiny spot (and I'm relatively small).

We got to try all of the different meats. The teriyaki steak and filet mignon were by far the best - tender and well seasoned. The pork had an interesting spice rub on it and I couldn't quite figure out what it was. I didn't prefer it. Ravioli and shrimp were both solid as well. \\n\\nI didn't realize how long fondue takes! It is a slow process not just cooking but going from course to course. We spent 3 hours working our way through the meal. We finished with flaming turtle and dark chocolate dessert fondue. I was thoroughly stuffed but I pressed on. You can't give up when chocolate is on the line. \\n\\nOur server was a good sport and even let us box up our leftover meats even though we weren't supposed to take them (it was all you can eat) but we couldn't get through even the first trays he brought so the house won that night. \\n\\nThe Melting Pot is definitely an experience and one good for celebrations or special occasions.

He said he had to call the man on the phone to see if change (still money) is okay, and as he does, he tells me he will be right back, just to realize he drove away with my food.

After the initial dish (that took about a reasonable 10-15 minutes to come out), we had no sight of anything else for the next 20 minutes.  In order to inquire about the rest of our orders, I had to wave down the host first since we couldn't get our waiter's attention. We were eventually told that our food would be out shortly, which turned out to be another 10-15 minutes before we got all our food. Personally, I think the overall wait was a bit ludicrous for four small plates. \\n\\nThe food themselves were nothing impressive. My two cents on our order:\\n\\nEggplants - did not have any actual flavor (except burned) and was just drenched in sauce. For better Asian style eggplants, try order \\"eggplant with basil\\" from Taiwan Cafe in Chinatown. \\n\\nKung Pao Chickpeas - These were okay and pretty unique as the key ingredient was chickpea instead of the usual chicken. However, if you are not a vegetarian, I would just order Kung Pao chicken at any Asian restaurant for double the portion. \\n\\nKimchee tofu with beef - Perhaps due to the seasoning/sauce, the tofu tasted really weird and almost fermented. I was actually doubting its freshness after my first bite. Regardless, just go to any Korean restaurants (Allston is supposed to be the gold mine for that) and get something that's better tasting and double in portion size.\\n\\nFried dumplings - a bit too meaty for my taste but some people might like it. However, with only three dumplings for $5, I know for a fact I can get cheaper and probably better ones elsewhere.  \\n\\nThe only nice part about our meal was that the waiter, sensing our impatience, brought us a free ginger brownie as a dessert to go.

The restaurant was not very busy. We waited ten minutes after sitting for service, and another ten to actually get a drink. Everyone in the restaurant looked angry, which should have been my cue to leave. Sadly, the service wasn't terrible because the restaurant was understaffed; plenty of employees, the place was just not managed well. We requested our check and we waited with empty drinks and dirty dishes in front of us for fifteen minutes before finally being closed out. I felt a little like I was in the twilight zone because no one would make eye contact with me. While I waited for fifteen minutes for my card to be ran, I snapped a picture of the wait staff. We also observed multiple tables sending food back for unknown reasons.

The white steamed bun is actually tasty, but a bit too thick. 4 stars.\\n\\nCongee. *Gigantic* bowl, but with a deceptively thick bottom. I'm not a congee connoisseur, so I need to defer the the Mrs, but it tasted flavourful and creamy to me. According to her, 4.25 stars.\\n\\nTruffle mushroom dumpling: More mushroom than anything, I didn't taste truffle. It was prettygood, even the skin was tasty. 4 stars.\\n\\nHar gow: tasty, better than most. Crispy flavourful skin and shrimp, but i wanted them to be bigger and more buttery. 4.25 stars.\\n\\nSiu mai (pork & shrimp dumplings) 5 stars\\n\\nFung chao: again, not my thing so I didn't partake.

Not my thing; I would give it 3 stars, but the Mrs insisted it was better than serviceable, so 3.75 stars between us.\\n\\nBeef meatballs: again, good texture, but kind of bland. No, really bland. Tasted like water. 1.5 stars.\\n\\n\\nShrimp spring rolls: excellent. 4.5 stars. Crisp, fresh filiing, flavourful. I think as good as you can get without elevating them.\\n\\nRecommended: Siu mai, cha siu soh, har gow, congee, cha siu bao. In fact if you eat here, you *must* try the siu mai & cha siu soh.\\n\\nAvoid: beef meatballs. I'd probably skip fung chao & turnip cake too.\\n\\n\\nConsidering the Mrs and I had no desire to eat dinner here again, the high quality of much their Dim Sum is a bit of a shock; the inconsistency isn't.

It seems like this spot changes hands and gets remodeled every year or so, and it was time to give this newish place a try.  The interior is spectacular, with a very high end yet rustic feel.  The bar is big yet classy, and the dinning areas are comfortable and well appointed.  Nearly the entire back wall is floor-to-ceiling shelves of wine sorted by region and type.  \\n\\nThe wine list is also impeccable, though perhaps a bit overpriced.  I had a glass from the reserve menu, and it was excellent.  So far so good...then we looked at the menu and that's when I got confused.  I expected a fine dinning experience in line with the surroundings and wine list, but instead I was handed a laminated menu that looked like it came from a pub.  There were lots of fancy appetizers, and the three that we had were good, but the rest was mostly fancied up pizza and sandwiches with just a few real entrees up in one corner.  My senses were also confused by the high-end classy ambiance vs. the fast-casual layout and menu font - look at their website and you'll see what I mean.\\n\\nAgain, everything we had was good, and the server was very friendly, but the mismatch of the setting, the wine, and the very limited and casual menu keeps me from giving a higher rating.  I will likely go back for apps and a glass of wine at some point, but I can't see me doing a full dinner there unless they expand and improve the menu.

Only 50% full, and when we left an hour later, at 8:15pm, it was still only half full. That should have been clue#1 (strictly speaking, my last review of a different BJ Brewpub was clue#1 since they were so bad).\\n\\nanyway, we ordered drinks after the waitress FINALLY showed up in 4-5 minutes. BJ porter for me; it's ok but tastes more like a stout, and near the bottom of the pint it started getting \\"sour\\" so I didn't finish it.\\n\\nchips/queso for appetizer......not a single solid chip in the whole basket. most are about the size of your thumbnail while the rest are more like broken half-chips (I actually took a picture!). it's like were given the bottom of the barrel. we actually had to tell the waitress to get more chips, which after 7-8 minutes we caught her again asking \\"where?\\". \\"Oh, they're making more right now\\" (and you didn't think to tell us this?). at this point our side salads are delivered. we're barely halfway thru the salads and the main orders are delivered (prime rib special, chicken parmesan, and spaghetti w/meatballs).\\n\\nit's obvious the chicken parmesan is Sysco-prepped, not kitchen prepped. My teen-age kid ate half the spaghetti saying it wasn't very good (stated the meatballs actually tasted better than the pasta) and then actually refused to take it home as leftovers! I mean, how can you screw up pasta to that extent ?!?\\n\\nSo, the service was slow, the food was barely palatable, and the place was not busy on a Friday evening when it should have been slammed in this economy. What does that tell you? Either the locals can't run a restaurant to save their lives or there are issues in the corporate chain. I'd bet on both. \\n When the prime rib is being advertised with a full meal and pizookie for $27, kinda sounds desperate for business doesn't it? Who wants to bet that the local manager will contact me here on Yelp apologizing -blah blah blah- and \\"what can we do to make it up/better\\"? anyone, anyone? Bueller?Bueller?\\n\\nLet me give you a clue, Mr BJ manager. People will accept apologies when YOU ARE PRO-ACTIVE. That means IN the restaurant, not damage control afterwards.  Servers are paid to serve, that means attentiveness. If I'm not being told about the status of my orders or why they are delayed (chips and queso, hint hint), then how can you complain about the bad reviews you get from customers?\\nLike I said, corporate issues and local restaurant operations.

I have no idea if it is truly authentic, but I thought the dishes were good. I had momos and some sort of jackfruit dish, at 3/5 on the heat scale. I honestly could've eaten the whole momo appetizer even with a main course on the way- they didn't skimp on the fillings and the sauce was the right amount of spice. The jackfruit main had a good proportion of jackfruit to potatoes. \\n\\nThe service was good- maybe a little slow but I wasn't waiting too long for anything. The server took the time to answer my questions about the spices they used and I appreciated that. They do mark which menu items may take longer to prepare, and that was nice to know in advance so I could plan accordingly. Even so, the main didn't take as long as I had expected. The patio seating was comfortable and you could enjoy the nice evening without too much street noise. I would recommend that if you aren't sure what level of spice to get to err on the side of caution- it is a different kind of heat than you might get in Mexican food or horseradish sauce or sriracha as it kind of creeps up on you and simmers and you may be half a dish in before you realize the gravity of the situation."},{"name":"Popover King","address":"74 Canal St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Popover King is located on 74 Canal Street a block from Haymarket Station. The restaurant specializes in popover, a light hollow roll made from an egg batter. The restaurant makes both dessert popovers and meat popovers. This is my go to place for brunch/lunch. \\n\\nMy favorite has to be Pop Lobster. If you love lobster rolls, this is a lighter and airier alternative to the dense traditional rolls that you typically get when ordering lobster rolls at other restaurants. I think the price is decent considering that the lobster meat is plentiful. \\n\\nMy next favorite is an all time brunch classic, Pop Benny. This is an eggs benedict; Two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce, ham, all sitting on a split popover. I must say, it's not easy to get your egg right all the time. I had one perfect egg and one that was cooked slightly a little over. Overall, very filling. I am not a fan of bagels or English muffins so the popover alternative has been truly a treat for me. \\n\\nI have also tried the Pop Lox (smoked salmon) and Pop Burger. I have to say the Pop Lox is good but I wouldn't order it again. I had wilted greens which was a turnoff. As for the burger, I am not sure if it is right to complain about a greasy well done burger. I wished they had the option of medium rare and allow you to remove some of the toppings. They didn't ask so I didn't bother to make the request which was my fault really. \\n\\nThe pan bagnat is a popover sandwich made with tuna, vegetables, olives, and scrambled egg. This was my first time if you would believe it, having this type of sandwich, so I can't say that I have anything to compare it to other than an tuna sandwich. This would be a upscale version. I think it was worth a try but I prefer the other available popover selection that the restaurant has to offer. It is a decent price if you order this with the lunch special, a sandwich and drink combination. \\n\\nFor the desserts popovers, I have tried two. The Pop Royal and the American Popover. Both are amazing. The Pop royal is amazing. It is filled with ricotta cheese and topped with berries. The American popover is your good old American pie but over a popover. I highly recommend these two desserts. \\n\\nI have only tried their lavender lemonade and have been a fan ever since. It goes well with everything I have tried and perfect as the weather is getting warmer. \\n\\nThe interior is cafe-like. You order at the counter and food is brought out to your table. I am not too keen of the decor and upkeep. The tables are not immediately wiped down so sometimes the tables can still have crumbs and the sorts left behind. However, the staff have been super friendly each time I have dine there. Boxing leftovers have been super easy. You can bring it to the counter and it will be neatly package in a paper box for to go. \\n\\nThis is not a fast food restaurant by any means. I have seen people run out to catch the next train. You really need to plan to dine in as your food is made to order and can take a while especially during the lunch rush. It used to be 15 minutes for my lunch order to come out when the restaurant first opened. Now that the restaurant gained popularity, the wait time is now approaching 30 minutes. If you have some place to be, this place might not be the best option for you. \\n\\nIf you are here only one time, I recommend this lunch combo,  pop lobster, with pop royal, and a 12 oz lavender lemonade. This will run about $35 if I remember correctly but it is a real treat. If you are are bringing a friend, also get the American popover. \\n\\nSee my pictures."},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Been coming to this place for years now and the food is always consistent and delicious!

Also I advise to get there before you are starving, put your name on the list and go for a walk around the neighbourhood or get a coffee from one of the many near by places to kill time and come back ready for a delicious breakfast feast!

Maybe we didn't order the right things? \\n\\nHad salmon tibs, filet mignon tibs, and foul. The tibs come with a side, - so we got miser and tomato fitfit. The tomato fitfit was quite bland, and just seemed like crushed tomatoes with torn pieces of injera. While the tibs were seasoned very well, it didn't taste as if it was spiced with any special Ethiopian spice at all. The cook on the meat and seafood was good, but there was nothing special about the way it was spiced. Also. Tons of oil used! \\n\\nWe ordered two portions of foul, one with butter and the other with olive oil. The waiter gave the wrong one and switched the two, and we had only noticed it tasted off (we were at a table with a few others) towards the end. So that was a bummer! Beans also could've been seasoned better. \\n\\nOnly good takeaway from the experience was the miser! Very well done, spiced nicely, and is reminiscent of Ethiopian flavors.

Absolutely my favorite place to eat their soup noodles like bun no hue, tomato crab soup noodles, udon, vermicelli with grilled pork, beef stew and whatever special they have for the day. They are simple, fresh and full of flavors. They don't overseason the soup with msg like in other restaurants. I just feel like I'm eating very healthy, homey food here. The owner is super nice and has excellent English as do the staff too. They may not have a 10 page menu, but you'll be craving to come back for more of their offerings. I only thing I don't get here is the pho noodles bcs it doesn't have beef tendon which is a must have for me. The soup broth is nonetheless good.

Terry Black's is one of my favorite places to bring visiting friends and family. It is a well known fact that the majority of good places in Austin will typically have a wait, especially during dinner time. Don't let this deter you from going to Terry Black's. These are the rules to ensure you are enjoying Terry Black's:\\n\\n\\n1. Try to get there before 7:30PM. That's when they generally start running out of things.\\n\\n2. Parking in their tiny parking lot can be a hassle. Send someone to wait in line while you find parking. Or park elsewhere and walk/scooter there.\\n\\n3. Ensure you check the handy parchment posted on the doors to make sure your \\"must haves\\" are there. Sometimes they run out of my favorite (pork ribs) earlier than anticipated, so I might go elsewhere or stay depending on my mood.\\n\\n4. Grab a drink from the outdoor bar window if it is being serviced. It helps with the wait if the line has extended to the porch. If it hasn't gotten that long yet, feel lucky! Sometimes it will reach the sidewalk and wrap around to the parking lot.\\n\\n5. When you make it to the sides, use your instincts. Get the sides you typically like, there are no funny twists here. Mac & cheese and green beans are my go-tos.\\n\\n6. Get dessert!!! the banana pudding here is a light fluffy cup from heaven, the corn bread is a good sweet tooth substitute too - moist and yummy.\\n\\n7. At the meat counter, the staff is super helpful and polite so don't be afraid to ask questions. Although the beef rib seems pricey, it is so worth it! Can't really go wrong with any of the choices on the board to be honest. Sometimes the brisket can be on the salty side, but typically very moist and tender.\\n\\n8. Send someone to scout for a table for you and your party while everyone else is paying and grabbing the extra fixings/drinks. People are really nice here, and quick to tell you that they'll be leaving soon.\\n\\n9. Don't forget to try the 3 different complimentary bbq sauces on the table! So thoughtful."},{"name":"Bonchon Salem","address":"299 Essex St","city":"Salem","stars":"3.5","text":"That chicken it's so crunch crunch!\\n\\n\\nMmmmmmmm Bonchon.\\n\\n\\nIf you don't like spicy food definitely order the garlic soy, I like ghost pepper wings and their wings are HOT AF in a wonderful way."},{"name":"Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen","address":"8111 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"It was our first visit to this location, very busy and there was only one person working behind the counter.

No wine or any other extras.\\n \\nPros:\\n\\nThe calamari and tiny fried anchovies were very flavorful. I wish they had served some marinara on the side... Even so, it was good, garnished with just lemon, salt, and leeks. Nice portion size.\\n\\nPanzanella was scrumptious and creative. I've never had capers and olives in my Panzanella before.\\n\\nCarapacchio had good flavor and was beautifully presented.\\n\\nSpinach and mushroom risotto served in a parmesan cheese cup was delicious and had great texture, not mushy or crunchy.\\n\\nThe filet was amazing, the best thing we had all night. The balsamic glaze and sauteed onions were the perfect complements to the tender beef, cooked medium (at the suggestion of our server, who talked us down from medium-well; it was the right choice).\\n\\nQuiet atmosphere. No loud, annoying music here.\\n\\nI did appreciate fresh forks being brought for our starters, after our salads.\\n \\nCons:\\n\\nOur salads came and my dining companion said, \\"Oh! I didn't know their portions would be so... artsy.\\" Code for: tiny! Salads small. The tiramisu was a tiny slice, so lonely on that big plate! We didn't know we should have taken them up on the offer of more bread...\\n\\nFennel salad had little flavor, even with the walnuts, goat cheese, and truffle oil. It was on the verge of being promising, but fell short.\\n\\nI was underwhelmed with the Bocconotti (dessert ravioli). In hindsight, I can see it was a mistake to order it. It was like something from a fried trailer at a fair. I didn't care for the fried ravioli filled with apples, served with a healthy coating of powdered sugar. I should have stuck with my first instinct and gotten the Zabaglione al Cioccolato. Sigh.\\n\\nService was Meh. Friendly, for the most part, if a little absent, and a little arrogant. Maybe he had too many tables; he was not the most attentive server I've ever had.\\n\\nThis place is in a strip mall. I don't have anything against strip malls, but when you have crooked and stained ceiling tiles, it's pretentious to have your prices so high and your portions so small... Also, the cheesy hallway to the back of the house (see the too-short drapes that hang there sadly) doesn't look pretty at all.\\n \\nBottom line: for $100+, I want more than I got.

Every time I go, I get the sausage & garlic pizza and split it with someone. They make their sausages homemade and they are delicious. That's why I get it on my pizza every time. Not only is their pizza fantastic, but their BBQ is awesome and a must try. They have lamb tips, their sausages, and steak tips they grill over hot coals. I split a pizza with a friend and I always order their lamb tips. FREAKIN AMAZING! The lamb is so moist and always has the perfect amount of char. Does not taste as gamy as most lamb out there. I know people who aren't the biggest fans of lamb but love Santarpio's lamb. They serve hot cherry peppers and homemade fresh bread at the table. I cut up pieces of the cherry pepper and eat it with the lamb tips. Amazing.\\n\\nThey have another location in Peabody for those of you living/staying/visiting near the Northshore area. The good thing is that I really don't notice a difference (if any at all) in the taste of food between the 2 locations. I know places that open multiple locations, people say \\"Gotta go to the original. The food is better.\\" but I don't see that case here. You can get just as good quality (if not the same) at the Peabody location so that's good. You don't lose the quality no matter where you go. \\n\\nPrices are reasonable for the most part. The pizza is priced very reasonable, especially for the quality you get. The BBQ is slightly on the pricier side but totally worth it.

That's it, though.  The hosts ruined this place for us. I know Austin likes to be known as weird, but one of these two in the front looked - and both acted - like they were out of a movie that had stereotypical gay/weird/high society/ too snooty to deal with you expressions and attitudes. They were disgusting and rude in behavior.  No smiles when greeted, rolled their eyes at us when they didn't think we were looking, when asked about the valet situation their answer was 'You have to ask them'.  I've been to some great restaurants around the country, and I'm from So. Louisiana - I know food, and I know friendly.  I don't mind paying for good food. This was the most expensive disappointing food I think I have ever had. I can't believe all of the raving reviews on this site - but I admit this is the only time I've been here, and everyone can have an off day.  But for $40 per entree, the seafood better be fresh, prepared well and tasty.  I had grouper, and it was totally dry with absolutely no flavor.  Zero flavor - not fresh, probably frozen.  One of the other reviewers mentioned no flavor for their Sea Bass and was wondering if that was normal.  Absolutely not.  Sea Bass is very flavorful and very rich and moist - it's a lot like crab meat if fresh and done well. One of the best fish. The lobster bisque was pretty good, but I guarantee that was not lobster - it was crab meat.  The $40 steak filet was beautiful, but had no flavor.  Ruth's Chris was within walking distance.  (Originated in New Orleans!)  That is a restaurant that knows flavor.  Should have gone there instead.  I love food and I love eating and hate, hate, hate to give bad reviews.

So like many others before me, I caved.\\n\\nI ordered the fajita steak and my friend ordered the al pastor.  Then we split it to get a taste of both.  We both agreed that the al pastor was good, the steak was out of this world.  In fact, I'm having cravings as we speak.\\n\\nThis will have to be a regular stop every time Rainey Street is visited.

I think this does a disservice to anyone in Austin who actually wants to try real spicy Indian food, because a buffet is the best way to ease people into this cuisine. There were maybe around 7 dishes or so and mostly vegetarian options. The daal was watery and flavorless, and the tandoori chicken did not have its red coloring or spice. The complimentary naan was the best part about the meal. The kheer had way too much saffron and sugar and it wasn't very good.

It was worth the wait.\\n\\nWhen I go to unusual places, I like to go for whatever I'd be unable to get anywhere else.  A quick look at the menu meant that 2 things would be on my must-do list: the d-lux burger (foie gras, peach and wine jelly) and the foie gras milkshake.  Never having actually having foie gras, this made me very nervous, but the risk paid off.  Both were delicious.  The burger was actually $19 (rather than $21 as printed on the online menu). As much as I enjoyed the burger, I don't think it was 2.5x as good as the other burgers and the next time I go back I'll try one of the other (less expensive) options.  (The southern burger looked fantastic.) I also had the amazing sweet potato tots.\\n\\nThe other thing I like to do is try unique mixed drinks.  The waiter mentioned their drink special: root beer float martini.  It was a mix of vanilla vodka and other stuff with a small scoop of ice cream and served with what I assume was dry ice to make it smoke a little.  Fantastic, amazing and while there was plenty of alcohol (I was pleasantly happy after the drink), I couldn't taste it.  A very dangerous drink.\\n\\nI then asked the waiter what the 2nd best drink was and had the mojito suggested, which is usually my go-to favorite drink.  While the mojito was certainly good, after the root beer float martini it seemed almost boring.

After last night, I will not go back. I was seated on the porch after being told when I made my reservation that that was the only place a table was available. When I arrived, though, I was very surprised to see many open tables in the main dining room. But back to the porch I went -- often lovely, and something different. Only last night, there was a deluge, and it was cold and windy. To be fair, someone asked when I was seated whether the seating was going to be OK, and I said yes, that the sound of the rain would be nice. But I didn't know we were in for a downpour and winds. I was chilled even with my sweater and the blanket provided. \\nThe worst part of the evening though was that the server became absent from me as she waited on a nearby birthday party. Then began a series of mishaps. The candle on my table blew out, and I exchanged it for a candle from an adjacent table. Then that one blew out. The server never noticed. At this point, I thought, OK, they're not at their best tonight...that happens. So I enjoyed cocktails, relaxed, was ready to order...but waited 15 minutes for my server, while I ate nearly an entire baguette because I was so hungry.  OK, I could manage that. Things happen. Finally, I ordered a delicious, delicious meal -- a pork chop and mashed potatoes -- but something that I could have cooked at home so hardly worth the $26 -- or the 30 MINUTE WAIT for my dinner. \\nThen there were more waits. The server never came back to check after she served me, but the water server did notice me sitting in my corner with an empty plate. He at least cleared my plate. I wanted dessert and waited another 12 minutes for my server to come  back -- yes, by this time I was checking because I was astonished at the delay. When the server arrived, I complained about the wait. She did not apologize but asked if I would like to talk to the owner. I said yes. The owner apologized and took my dessert and coffee order. But the cake came out first, before the cappuccino, which took another five minutes. Usually, the coffee comes first, right? Regardless, It was a joke, because there were still more waits. I was ready to leave. I was cold, I was angry, and I was ready to get home. No one brought a check -- was it going to be on the house because of the exceptionally  poor service, I wondered? I pulled out my credit card, laid it on the table and waited another 10 minutes. The owner came to check on me and saw I had not even received my check, but she did make sure I got that. But my night was ruined.  The owner, who apologized and said the kitchen was backed up, comped my coffee and dessert. That hardly sufficed for ruining my night -- and I still paid for my drinks and meal and left a low (15%) tip because I don't believe in stiffing servers because I know other factors often  contribute. The nearby table of 7 seven seemed to be getting their food on time, so my guess is the focus went there and the likely large tip that would be forthcoming. \\nRestaurants are supposed to be able to accommodate crowds -- and there wasn't even a large crowd last night. The kitchen being \\"backed up\\" is a poor excuse for a patron sitting in the cold, without food, without a candle and without even water.\\n As I told the owner, I am especially watchful of good and poor service to older women like me, because we are too often overlooked, underserved and treated as if we are invisible. That's how Babette's treated me last night. So, much as I have enjoyed Babette's Cafe in the past, I will not be going back. They ruined an important night for me and did not make it right.

The beans and the slaw stood out, much better than the 6 other BBQ places I visit when in Austin.  I liked the consistency of the frijoles and the overall ordering process.

Also, if you buy a bag of coffee you get a free small coffee (~$3 value)! Since a 12 oz. bag of their blends are $13-14 and their single origins go for $14-15, getting a free small cup of coffee makes me feel like I'm paying $10-12 for a bag. Their coffee is on the expensive side, but for me, I feel like that cup makes it worth it.\\n\\nAs a millennial who never has cash on them, another plus for this place is that they accept cards for all cases. Java Monkey, on the other hand, charges a debit card fee if you're under a specific amount.\\n\\nI feel like Java Monkey and its patrons have a more funky, alternative vibe while Dancing Goats and Ebrik are filled with Yoga moms and modern hipsters. Out of the three, I would say Java Monkey and Dancing Goats are probably your best options if you want to sit with your pup and enjoy your drink since their outdoor seating areas are a lot bigger.\\n\\nTheir beverages won't blow you away, but it's quality coffee and you'll leave content. That being said, Ebrik is still my favorite coffee place near Decatur Square.

At first when I heard they came to Atlanta I wasn't too intrigued about burger stuffing in a sushi roll. It seemed like a cool fusion so of course I was adventurous and gave it a try anyways. I came here twice already and I'm impressed. I love the interior here and how spacious it is. \\n\\nIf it's your very first time, definitely get a bento box. If you're coming with someone else-get a bento box and a burgushi. \\n\\nWe started off with the Crab Rangoon Dip appetizer. This was so indulging and good I had to stop myself from picking up so much. The rangoon chips were oily for us to be able to eat all of it. Get this definitely if it's your first visit. \\n\\nSecond visit for the appetizer we tried the calamari (it was okay), not better than a typical chinese style salt and pepper squid. Also we got the blackened tuna nachos. I think I'll get these from now on every time we come here. This was my favorite item that I've had at Cowfish. It comes in an order of 5 and the chips are topped with crab rangoon dip, avocado salsa mix, fresh seared blackened tuna and some greens. \\n\\nMy first time here I got the ultimate bento box, this was about $18. It came with 2 burger slides featuring the burger of the week. Best question to ask your server about these boxes is what is the burger of the week. I'm sure they get this everyday, so maybe place a hand written card at the table describing the burger of the week could be a good idea. My box came with a barbecue style burger with blue cheese and some other sauces paired that I can't recall. Also what came with the box was your choice of a 4 piece sushi roll, I ended up getting the firecracker. It was decent, I'm not a huge fan of rolls to be honest because of the amount of rice. If they included a sashimi option, it'll be a huge plus because thats mostly what I eat when it relates to sushi. You also get sweet potato fries, soybeans and pickled cucumbers. I enjoyed everything in this box, but most  likely won't get it again since there are many new items on the menu to try out. \\n\\nSecond visit-tried the All American Burgushi. (Big Mac in a sushi roll) This was pretty good and i'm surprised. I got this roll with seaweed salad instead of fries. I didn't want to feel bloated after dinner. \\n\\nA dessert I tried was the coconut cheesecake. This was alright, wasn't too sweet but I wish I got the chocolate dessert instead. \\n\\nService can vary, I heard from my other friends who came prior says it hasn't been the best since they are still new.

We weren't too keen on the smoked ham, but overall it was tasty.

Came here for the first time the Saturday after the opened (they opened on Friday April 28th). \\n\\nCame at around 8:30pm on Saturday and they were full but we were the first people on the wait list. They told us it would be a 20 - 30 minute wait but we only waited about 7 - 10 minutes before we were seated. We sat down and ordered right away. It took about 25-30 minutes for us to get all of our food which is quite a long time. I'd normally be a bit more upset by this but given that this was their second night open I will give them the benefit of the doubt. The side dishes of potato, kimchi and picked radish came quickly though and they were good about replenishing the side dishes once we had finished them. \\n\\nWe ordered the bulgogi, the rice cake in beef bone broth, and the spicy pork belly bibimbap. The rice cake in beef bone broth came first. The soup was pretty mild with a peppery flavor. The soup had a few dumplings in it along with some sliced, cooked beef, and a sort of omelette. This was my least favourite dish of the bunch just because I normally prefer food with bolder flavors but it was definitely still tasty. The bulgogi was very flavourful and probably my favourite of the night. It came with a bit of lettuce and sliced (I think pickled) radish. The beef had the perfect amount of sweetness in the marinated and was well cooked. I really enjoyed taking a bit of the thinly sliced radish and eating it with the bulgogi. I have no idea if that's how you're supposed to eat it but regardless, it tasted good. The bibimbap had good flavour to it and was tasty. I  was a bit disappointed that it didn't come in the hot stone bowl but I later learned that not all bibimbaps are served that way. I used about half of the gochujang and I felt like it was enough for my taste. Although it was a spicy dish, I didn't find it to be overly spicy and was completely manageable. If you love spice like me, you'd probably want it to be a bit spicier. \\n\\nMy husband and I were able to finish everything we ordered (mind you we're pretty big eaters and I was quite full when we were done). The three dishes with two soft drinks cost us $50 after tax (before tips) which I though was a bit pricey. I think the one thing that really drove the price up was the bulgogi which was $18 before tax so I think had we ordered something else it wouldn't have been as much). \\n\\nOverall, the food was good, the service was friendly (albeit slightly slow but again, we came on day 2) and I'd definitely come back. However, they are still struggling a bit with some start up issues. For example, they're not yet licensed and may not be for another two weeks. Their service was a bit slow so if you're impatient, maybe give them a couple weeks before trying it out. Also, at around 9:30pm there was a couple that just got seated at the table across from us and we over heard the server tell them that they ran out of rice, and then ultimately it sounded like they either ran out of food or they shut down the kitchen because they ended up leaving shortly after they ordered so maybe try and come during peak dining hours until they sort themselves out. The server was quite apologetic but I think they should've at least offered them a discount next time or a free meal or something as a gesture of good faith seeing how new they are."},{"name":"Summer Shack-  Cambridge","address":"149 Alewife Brook Pkwy","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Funky- it's quite the experience: from the huge tiki-fisherman outside, to the chef's video of how to get lobster meat out at the entrance (as if in anticipation), to the live lobster pool at the center.

Not just any Ethiopian cuisine but 4 start Yelp worthy cuisine.  On this particular day I went at around 1 PM and there was a line out in the street waiting to get in.  Yes, people do not know how to angle the line to get the F out the street.  Yes it is a pet peeve of mines.  Now back to my review.  This was not a deterrent for me.  Hey we are here might as well try it out especially after all the Yelp reviews that praised this place.  So who comes out better?  Ethiopian cuisine in Atlanta or in DC?  Keep reading if you are curious.  \\n\\nAs I said the line was out in the street (parking lot) but even after getting in line the wait was no more than 10 minutes.  It was around lunch time so it was expected and it was on a long holiday weekend.  There is seating on the inside and outside but on the Hotlanta day I chose to go inside.  The place is a bit small on the inside but not to the point where your booty is hitting someone's drink when you slide between the tables to get out.    \\n\\nI started out with the sambusas and I admit I was expecting them to come out in a triangle shape.  When they came it was in a lumpia type roll and shape.  Still these sambusas were good.  I went with the beef and it had a bit of a spicy kick that hit you quick then went away.  There is a plethora of adult beverages and many selections of honey wine.  The menu was filled with selections especially when you were able to build your own combinations.  I was going with the lamb tibs as a safe bet but then my guest and I saw that there was a three meat platter.  Score.  We went with the fish, lamb, and chicken combo and it was an excellent choice. It also comes with a choice of two sides where we went with cabbage and miser (spicey red lentil soup).  Do not let the word spicy fool you.  There is an option to add more spice at a 75 cent upcharge.  The meat was cooked perfectly but wish it was on an iron skillet to keep the meat a tad bit warmer since it took a minute to put this meal down.  I also wanted a bit more spice but we all know how that goes.  One person's perfect spice is another's mouth torture.  The lamb was cooked perfectly but found myself gravitating to the grilled fish.  All the meat had a perfect char which I like and the seasoning and fresh ingredients really shined.   \\n\\nSo I see why the line was out the door and my hunger fully confirmed it.

The carbonara piqued our interest because it included brussel sprouts, which we wanted to try.

Desta is the most popular destination for Ethiopian food in Atlanta. I first visited in 2009. Back then, the restaurant was small and humble. Since that time, the interior has been renovated, a second story added, and the place looks relatively fancier. The menu has been revamped and is much better when it comes to English descriptions.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review update, I've dined at roughly a half dozen Ethiopian restaurants in metro Atlanta. In terms of consistently good food and service, Desta wins (with Queen of Sheba first runner-up). Since Desta sees a lot of customers, the kitchen churns out many orders daily and the food is generally fresh. Service is close to being a well-oiled machine.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located near the corner of Clairmont and Briarcliff where there are several Ethiopian businesses including competing restaurants with similar cuisine. Desta is in a sort of odd strip/building complete with patio and drive-thru/pick-up window. The drive-thru is used for \\"market\\" items and cooking ingredients. The interior glass doors to the first floor dining room are decoratively etched and nice. There's both an upstairs and downstairs bar. The upstairs area is known as the \\"Shiro Room at Desta\\" and can be booked for private functions.\\n\\nDesta's latest menu reminds me of some American fast casual chain menus where you can customize your meal by following a series of steps. For tibs (sauteed meat and vegetable entrees) for example, you follow a three-step process: (1) choose a meat, (2) choose a carb, and (3) choose a side. It's an interesting and friendly way to present Ethiopian food.\\n\\nBreakfast foods such as chechebsa (cracked wheat bread braised with berbere spice and butter/oil) and kinche (crushed wheat, kind of like Ethiopian oatmeal) are offered. There's fit-fit or fir-fir (injera served with different meats and sauces) and kitfo (steak tartare) along with various vegetables and stews (e.g. shiro - chickpea stew). Prices are reasonable and one can expect to get a good and filling meal for about $15 per person.\\n\\nThe best way to eat Ethiopian food is communally. Injera is the traditional bread eaten with Ethiopian food. It's a spongy sourdough flatbread that is served in rolls. Injera is also used as the main eating utensil. Unroll and tear off a piece and use it to scoop up food. Technically, you're supposed to eat with your right hand. If you don't like the taste and texture of injera, Desta offers rice, white and wheat bread, and pita bread. If you don't like eating with your hands, Desta provides silverware.\\n\\nI recommend one of the platters such as the Meat Lovers tibs platter and the Vegetarian Platter. The latter comes with 10 different vegetarian selections. On the Meat Lovers platter, you can choose three meats from lamb, ribeye, filet mignon, chicken, fish, and ground beef. The meats are cut into small, bite-size pieces and cooked with spices, sliced purple onions, chopped tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and olive oil. The lamb is probably my favorite from this lot followed by the fish (tilapia) which is served in slightly bigger pieces than the lamb, beef, and chicken.\\n\\nThe seasoned meats and vegetables are served atop additional rolls of injera. Overall, the various meat tibs are rather appetizing. The saturated, sauce-soaked bits of leftover injera are oftentimes the tastiest part of the meal.\\n\\nAlso recommended is the kitfo, which is Ethiopian steak tartare. You can choose to have the meat cooked, but the best (and authentic) way to eat it is raw. Yes, it's like eating raw hamburger, but it's actually delicious because the meat is lean, finely minced, and seasoned with mitmita (chili, cardamom, clove, salt mix) and butter. Kitfo has a distinct flavor and aroma to it and should be eaten with injera.\\n\\nThe vegetables are quite tasty because of the savory stews and sauces. It's hard to go wrong with any of the vegetable selections. If you want something hearty and traditional, try one of the pea or lentil stews such as the aforementioned shiro, ater (split peas), or miser (spicy red lentils). I'm partial to the latter which is cooked with onions and berbere, a spice mixture that includes chili, garlic, ginger, and basil. The gomen (collard greens) and tikel gomen (cabbage) are mouth-wateringly great.\\n\\nAsk for a spice rack which includes a jar of spicy red chili paste, similar to Asian sambal oelek, and a jar of orange-red mitmita powder (ingredients mentioned above). Eat enough of it and the red chili paste can bring the heat.\\n\\nService is speedy and attentive for the most part. Orders come out from the kitchen in a fair amount of time. If going to Desta on a weekend or holiday evening, it wouldn't hurt to call and make a reservation. Otherwise, you might end up waiting for a table."},{"name":"La Costita","address":"7405 SW Barbur Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Ron and I were going to go to Gilda's, but they were packed.  We tried several other places,including our fave Buffalo Gap, and even started to stop at a couple of the McMenamin's restaurants in the area, but neither of us are fans of McMenamin properties.  We peeked inside of Chez Jose, but oh so packed and noisy as well.  Both of us knew we'd gotten off on the wrong foot by getting a late start (I'd had a water emergency on one of the properties where I work, and he had to wait for me until the vendors got there to work on the emergency).  When all was said and done, he was hangry, and I was tired, hungry, and ornery.  I used to live in the Burlingame neighborhood and ate often at the predecessor to La Costita, La Costa.  It was absolutely terrific, best salsa in town hands down, and the author, Susan Orlean (\\"The Orchid Thief\\") had once been a waitress there.  They rebuilt the restaurant about 15 years ago and turned it into a very attractive venue rather than the older tired and more-cliched tiled Mexican restaurant, and I had only been back a couple of times, but still loved the food there.  So that was how a couple of tired, hangry, hungry, and ornery wanderers ended up there.\\n\\nEverybody who greeted us and our waiter were such nice people, funny, and appropriately talkative.  If we wanted more salsa or chips, it was taken care of immediately.  Our drinks (blackberry margarita and a chi-chi) arrived immediately, but Ron felt there was something off about his chi-chi.  My margarita slid right down just fine.  The chips came warm and crisp, and there was nothing outstanding about them at all, and but I had such disappointment about the salsa.  It is now watered down such that it's closer to salsa water than chunky deliciousness.  We ordered something called the wired steak and that dish came with corn tortillas, rice, and beans.  It all lacked flavor.  The steak strips were tough and nearly unchewable.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is laid out nicely, all very clean, and still very attractive and definitely not a cliche of a Mexican place.  It's quiet and relaxed, the perfect place on a Friday night.  And again the staff was outstandingly responsive and warm and friendly.\\n\\nIt's sad when a former great restaurant \\"friend\\" goes downhill, especially when you promise someone else that it was so great really.

The waitress at the bar talked to the manager and was able to still get my order in under the wire.\\n\\nI ordered their Baby Back Rib special with sides of potato salad and mac & cheese, and a half-price \\"Hawgarita\\". Some guy behind me, Joe, who seemed to be related to the restaurant, was extremely drunk and shouting expletives at the TV and at people who walked in and left after being told the kitchen was closed. As I waited, I remembered watching the restaurant on Lifetime TV's \\"Catering Wars\\" where they acted very rambunctious and fired their chef.\\n\\nThe potato salad was decent but watery. The Mac & Cheese was completely unremarkable, which clashed with my memory of the previous 5 times I had been there. The baby back ribs were still, indeed, delicious, with a nice rub, good sauce, and very tender. The \\"Hawgarita\\" was a decent margarita, but the mass of thin ice on top made sipping from the top to get that salt/margarita flavor very diluted and watery. Serve it in a smaller bottle and strain the ice and we might be in business.\\n\\nThe service here has always been a problem. I once brought my family after seeing an \\"Animal House\\" Burger promoted as a special on Facebook. This burger was a half-beef, half-kangaroo patty with bacon, fried green tomatoes, bacon, a fried egg, and crawfish √©touf√©e. I can recite this from memory because it was delicious, and the kitchen here used to have that level of imagination and execution. I still regret never tasting the watermelon jalape√±o ribs former chef Matthew Moseley once imagined and served.\\n\\nThe sad thing about this visit is that the server, usually the weak point here, seemed to be the only one that cared about the service, the food, the cursing drunk, you name it. The draft list, once thoughtfully composed, has shifted to a mailing-it-in mix of five Sweetwater taps and an American macro-brew. The maple habanero BBQ sauce that was once their best sauce was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nOne star for the server who seemed to care in spite of an owner and management. One star for good ribs.\\n\\nI would have once given 4 stars for better sauces, sides, draft beers, and a chef-focused kitchen, though with mediocre service and not family/wife friendly.\\n\\nNow, subtract the chef element, draft beers, and declining imagination on the sides and specials, and I'm disappointed.\\n\\nI may return to pick up an order of their broader selection of smoked wings, but I'm skeptical."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Personally, the burger is not bad, but not the best in the town.

My main gripe was the slowwwwww service. My fiance and I had arrived at opening, and there was essentially no one in the restaurant or outdoor patio (which is dog-friendly!). We picked a spot outside and were greeted promptly and asked our drink orders.\\n\\nThe server didn't come back for quite awhile. While we were waiting, my fiance and I were perusing the menus. A large group got seated in front of us. We didn't think much of it at the time. When we finally received our waters, we were ready to order. Since we didn't want to wait again, we gave our entire order of: Phat Club, The Big Cheez, Nutty Valentine, and the Freebird. We expected them to course it out for us. \\n\\nWe figured the portions were huge, so we opted to share the Club and Big Cheez, which was probably a good decision, since it ended up being just the right amount of food. We were starting to get pretty hungry, and since it didn't seem like it was getting too busy yet, we expected our food to be out fairly quickly.\\n\\nSo, we waited. And waited. And waited. The larger party in front of us got their food BEFORE us, which kinda pissed me off. We waited at least 45 minutes (from the time of ordering) before we finally received our food - all at once. Which is fine, I guess. But it was pretty warm out, so the Nutella on my Nutty Valentine was starting to get too melty for my liking, while I was eating the other food.\\n\\nWe also didn't get any water refills for very long periods of time, and with it being fairly warm outside, I felt like I could drink gallons of water. It just wasn't a pleasant experience of having to wait for everything, when we got there clear before anyone else. It's highly possible that we didn't get great service because we weren't going to be as large of a tip. Therefore, we just ended up disregarded.\\n\\nThe Phat Club was just okay. I found that while the novelty of having a donut as a bun is quirky, I didn't particularly care for it. I would much rather have regular bread with my club. It just ended up being too greasy for my liking. The chips that came with it were very good though. The Big Cheez on the other hand, was freaking delicious, and I could have easily eaten several more. It's served with several sauces, but I liked the Garlic Butter one the best.\\n\\nI really liked my Nutty Valentine donut, and I felt that it was the perfect finish to my meal. It's on the lighter end of their donut spectrum, and it didn't taste too bland, like some other donuts can when they use the same donut base. My fiance really enjoyed his Freebird, despite not being able to finish it. He's a donut connoisseur.\\n\\nIf I'm in town again, I would definitely stop by again. Hopefully, service will be better next time around. Sitting outside is nice, if you don't mind the bugs trying to land on your food and suck your blood.

Although a little pricey at $5, presumably their imported matcha powder is nicer than other cafes in town. The only sorta let down was the \\"Famous Chicken Waffle\\", which includes a tartar sauce and coleslaw. Apparently they mix this up with their regular chicken waffle dish on occasion - I had to send mine back so they could add the coleslaw topping. While overall it wasn't bad, the coleslaw was nothing special (like say, having a spicy kick or sweet crunch from fruit as seen in other places), and just accelerated the soggification of my chicken crust and waffles. The waffles themselves are neither Belgian nor Southern, but something lighter with kind of a mochi-like texture as you try to cut and pull it apart. Nice try, but I wish it were crispier (maybe it was the back and forth from the kitchen plus slaw?). The chicken was nice and juicy, but in the end, I don't think it was worth the almost $14 for this dish. (I still have Lo-Lo's in Phoenix in my mind, which has better chicken & waffles for 2/3 the price, sorry!) They also dish out alcohol, but aside from their matcha latte, I'm coming back to try some of their coffee and poke bowls.\\n\\nThis cafe has its own distinct and welcoming look, with pop art decorating the walls (and bathrooms - men's seems to pay homage to donuts), and a variety of seating areas.

I'm hoping it's the latter, but it's probably a little bit of both.\\n\\nFor starters, I've probably visited this location thirty or more times over the last decade.

Heck, maybe I've been over sixty times and I've lost count.\\n\\nSadly, this establishment is not only not what it once was, it represents a pathetic excuse for a restaurant. I and a friend recently went there and were made to wait over forty minutes for our food, something which would be wholly unacceptable by any restaurant standards, but especially at a quasi fast food chain. My friend told me that this was the new normal for this site and said we should have driven to Quincy Center to get food instead as it would have saved us twenty-five minutes. They were right.\\n\\nThe staff completely failed to acknowledge that this was a problem, did not address the issue at hand or attempt to make any amends for the miserable quality of service. I had an experience here back in 2013 where I waited about 15 minutes for my meal and the gentleman behind the counter gave me a free sandwich and apologized for the wait, even though I wasn't upset and didn't ask for either thing. This time the staff did not even acknowledge the fact that there was a line or make any pleasantries. While I certainly can sympathize with the staff having a difficult and thankless job, they do themselves no favors by flat-out refusing to put in any effort.\\n\\nThis location is an embarrassment to the Boston Market brand. Others have suggested getting new employees and management, but this location may be far beyond redemption. The best course of action would be to lose the franchise tag and shut this site down.

What we weren't sad about, however, was that we had made brunch plans at Cafe Medina. It was a small storefront but we eventually got ourselves and all of our towed luggage in. They sat us without fuss despite our probably annoying carry-ons all around us. A simple but delectable menu was given to each of us and soon, we were served.\\n\\nOne of my friends typically has a breakfast of granola, fresh fruit, and yoghurt, all of which were offered here and happily ordered them. The waffle sounded like it had a nice crunch to it, and despite the deceiving size, the serving of fruit and yoghurt was manageable. My other friend got the Tagine (2 poached eggs, spicy tomato stew, red pepper, merguez sausage, Moroccan olives, cilantro, hummus, and raita with grilled Foccacia), a menu item I personally had been eyeing as well. Full of flavor, this is not one to be missed. I got a quick taste and was immediately drawn to all the seasoning in the stew.\\n\\nMy own entree for that morning was their Saumon Fume (toasted ciabatta, fried egg, smoked salmon caper cream cheese, sliced avocado, arugula, peppadew, and artichoke salad). For some reason when I read the description, I had thought it was going to be one whole sandwich with everything in it. However, I was happy to see that wasn't the case and my long plate had to be photographed in sections to aptly capture the food items. The toasted ciabatta was just perfectly crunchy and soft in all the right places. Vancouver's smoked salmon hadn't disappointed yet, and Cafe Medina was not one to go against that; with caper cream cheese, it was just divine. As for the salad, well it was the first to go! Very lightly dressed, it gave a lot more focus to the natural flavors of the vegetables which was a welcome thing. I wish I could come here for brunch more often!"},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Desta is my go to place for Ethiopian food.

These are gourmet brioche donuts in unique flavors that you won't find anywhere else. \\n\\nWe each selected a donut and split each one. I recommend doing that so you can try a variety, plus the flavors are so rich and intense that eating a whole donut of one flavor might be overwhelming. The Mexican Chocolate, Valrhona Chocolate Crunch, and Blueberry Bourbon Basil were our choices. I loved the custard inside the Valrhona Chocolate and the texture variance of the crispies on top. The BBB was my favorite because the flavor wasn't overpowering nor was it too sweet. It was a nice balance to the other 2 intensely chocolate flavors. You really can't go wrong though.

But in recent times, the quality has dramatically declined including professionalism of staff and quality of food, leaving only the decor and ambience of the place to give it any credit. Thanksgiving dinner was unpalatable and very pricy- the turkey was super dry and completely unseasoned, vegetables on the plate were scarce and extremely dehydrated and stuck to the plate as if they sat in a heater/microwave, and stuffing was sandy and flavorless like it was from a box. Nothing about it was fresh or tasty, and I got horrible indigestion that night and the next day. Sad to say, but a dinner at Chili's or another franchise chain would've been better. The server was nice but visibly showed signs of stress and confusion, and spoke out loud to us about issues going on in the back and with the manager, which are all frowned upon in the service industry because you shouldn't reveal your institution's weaknesses.

I think my favorite thing here so far is the fried wonton. They are full of cheese. It melted in my mouth. They are the best I have had in Austin. We got there right before closing and they served us and did not make us feel rushed. The waiter was fabulous and said that a lot of people ordered the kids wonton soup. The cucumber salad was good as well. We will be back. \\n\\n\\n\\nI came back and enjoyed the white rice . The chicken and the dumplings were excellent as well.

The lines were long, but moved at a quick pace due to the fast and friendly service. We ordered a couple OG glazed, a couple buttermilk old fashioned, a maple bacon and the hot Mexican chocolate (I can't remember the actual name ) all of which were tasty...some more than others. I had the highest expectations for the OG. They looked fantastic, unfortunately they were only so-so. They were sweet and soft but other than the sweetness lacked any real additional flavor. The maple bacon was next. It wasn't over powering in sweetness like other maple donuts I've had elsewhere and the bacon added a nice savory note to the sweet glaze. My favorite of the bunch was the old fashioned buttermilk. The glaze crept into each nook and cranny of the old fashioned and added a wonderful crunch to each bite, writing it now makes me want another ! Lastly was the spicy chocolate one, again, I can't remember what it was actually called. My wife ended up eating this one. According to her it was very rich and chocolate-y with a bit of a kick in its aftertaste. She liked it! I would absolutely recommend giving Blue Star a try if you're looking to try something different than Voodoo."},{"name":"Mix'D UP Burgers","address":"2371 Hosea L Williams Dr SE, Bldg 3","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The location to go to is 313 blvd SE Atlanta. This location on Hosea leaves little to be desired. No offense, but the owners looked like they felt out of place even being here and it translated into the staff and the food which was mediocre at best.\\n\\nWe were highly disappointed considering we had visited the original location ( listed above) a couple of week prior and gave it rave reviews. Mind you , the location we like is extremely small with limited indoor or outdoor seating. However, Chef T was helpful and passionate about his business. This translated into very good and enjoyable food.\\n\\nHere at the Hosea location all we received was, attitudes, mean mugging, awkward stare downs, slow food delivery and average food.  While this spot attempts to portray itself as an upscale local gastro-pub, the lack of friendly service and good food makes it a bit more pretentious.\\n\\nONE & DONE!"},{"name":"Gyro and Kebab House Needham","address":"1056 Great Plain Ave","city":"Needham","stars":"4","text":"I am so happy to have this Mediterranean place in town! I got the falafel appetizer which was a very generous serving of falafel on a bed of hummus and tahini and veggie salad. It was served with warm, naan-like bread - not a piece of typical pita bread. Also had the chicken kebob with rice and salad, which was very moist and flavorful. I will definitely be going back. Although they have a few tables there, I imagine their primary business will be takeout and delivery."},{"name":"PDX Sliders","address":"3111 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The young lady working the front was rude and lacked product knowledge at the Division location. Food was over salted, over cooked, wrong, and thrown together without care. I've eaten at both locations many times, but that was by far the worst I've experienced. I don't like to complain, but when it comes to allergies, please know the product or be willing to double check. I really like being able to breath.

I must say, their food is surprisingly good for the type of joint it is. Even though I don't live nearby anymore, whenever I'm in the area I stop by.\\n\\nTheir Chicken Fingers are fantastic. At most pizza places they just pull whatever their supplier provides out of the freezer and throw it in the fryer, but at Cappy's they use fresh chicken, batter it, and fry it right in front of you. You can really taste the difference. The salads (Greek with Steak Tips being my favorite) and Chicken Parm are great as well.\\n\\nI honestly don't care for the pizza, but their slices are definitely larger than the average. Portions are generous overall along with reasonable prices, so Cappy's is a great value.\\n\\nThe Brazillian staff...aren't friendly in a traditional sense, but are nice in their own rough-and-ready way. I can't speak for the delivery service since I always went by foot.\\n\\nNote: They don't have have a bathroom, which is mildly annoying, especially considering the size of the place."},{"name":"Render Coffee","address":"563 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"It was $3.45 for mediocre apple cider.

When here for a supper club meeting, I've never had this type of food before, so I was expecting an adventure.  Now I got an adventure but not the good kind. We started with the Shark Bites, I'm not really a seafood fan but it's shark so how can I say no.  They weren't as good as I was expecting but I wouldn't call them bad. Had the fried poke chop [pork chop] with mac & cheese. Pork chop could have used some gravy as it was super dry, and the mac & cheese wasn't from the box, but it wasn't fantastic either.  The crab rice was so salty it was inedible, drinks were slow [not alcohol] but water, tea, etc. We had to wait on utensils to be washed because they ran out. A/C wasn't working. Just a multitude of things that failed that night. I'm ITP and it usually takes a lot for me to travel OTP, this won't be one of those reasons."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"What can I say that's not going to sound bias. I've been a loyal customer since their time beside Chambar. Cafe Medina's level of service is amazing and always consistent. Expect long wait times so plan ahead hangry people. This time around however we were very lucky as was able to find a seat at the bar within 15mins. I decided to start with a Lavender latte, followed by Le Complet, and finishing off with a waffle with white chocolate pistachio. (I apologize in advance for the pictures as I uploaded them from snapchat and already made comments) For a newbie, I highly recommend all the dishes I ordered and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

However, all that oil came in handy for the very dry vegan okra perloo. The rice was hard and dry, but putting the cabbage on it, made it much more pleasant. The vegan veggie of the day was corn on the cob. \\n\\nOn their website they say they are known for their rice dishes.

I made the mistake of letting my eyes get the best of me and ordering a bit more than I probably should have for the meal (if you can call that a problem, given that I would have gladly ordered more), but have no fear, the rest was still delicious when I had it later.\\nThe brisket was mouth-watering. They have BBQ sauces to use, but when the meat is so good, there's no extra flavor needed.\\nThe space is large, but when I was there for a lunch, it remained basically full the entire time - clearly a good sign. We didn't have to wait long, though, as the line moved at a good pace and tables opened up regularly.  They have a efficient system.  Ordering sides is cafeteria style, and then you step up to a cutting station to get whichever juicy cut of meat you prefer, in the weight of your choice."},{"name":"Tassili's Raw Reality","address":"1059 Ralph D Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down, one of my favorite places to eat in Atlanta. A friend and I left the park one day and wanted to try a vegan restaurant and our options were between Slutty Vegan and Tassili's. I'm so glad we chose Tassili's. It was a bit of a wait, but we weren't in a major rush so it was all good. They let you sample their add-ons, the wraps are huge (they are slick heavy) and the staff is always welcoming. They are a little pricier but all the ingredients are delicious and fresh so I honestly don't blame them. They always play good music in here too, I be jamming in line lol. Only other con is sometimes they close a little earlier and you won't know that prior to arriving, so you'll get there to see a note on the door. That can be a little annoying since I live on the north side of Atlanta, but it's obviously not enough to keep me from coming back. I would recommend calling them before if it's closer to their closing hours to double check and not waste a trip. Overall, great food, great service, great energy.
