THE PEPPERS ARE BACK!!!\\n\\nFirst of all, thanks to Keith E. for the \\"heads-up\\" about the early bird specials.  I've been eating there longer than he, and I never knew.  Like him, my favorite is also the Italian Gourmet.  Now, my favorite is gonna be a SIX DOLLAR Itailian Gourmet, though they're worth every penny, even at full price. \\n\\nI've been eating at this location since Dave Tucci was affifiated with Delaware, more than 15 years now.  Then came the name change.  I was in a Delaware shop up in North Austin one day, and asked why Tucci's place was no longer one of their franchisees.  The story I got is that Delaware Corporate wanted its owners to cough up some BIG bucks for a remodel, with stuff like granite countertops, etc. to the tune of  $20,000+!!!  Hey would YOU?  Not me, and not Dave.  Dave was NOT the only owner who decided NOT to do it, and I applaud him for it.  This is NOT The Brown Derby in L.A.; this is a SUB SHOP in AUSTIN!  For God's sake, I come here for the FOOD.  Period.  You can't eat a COUNTER.  \\n\\nAnyway, now you know why the name change.  But don't worry, same owner is at the wheel, so all is right with the world.  \\n\\nI think Delaware shot themselves in the foot with this move; now, THEY have at least two fewer outlets that I know of in Austin, maybe more.  Not even one South of the River, but that's OK; we've got Tucci's Southside, and it's even better.  Read on to find out why. \\n\\nWhen the name (and the menu) became Tucci's, things did change initially.  To me, one of the main things that separates these subs from the competition are the HOT & SWEET PEPPERS.  Without them, while the subs are still excellent, nothing really makes them any different than someone elses's quality sub.  I mean, nothing REALLY stands out without those peppers.  They're a unique touch that nobody else does except for...well, you know.  \\n\\nThe peppers disappeared from Tucci's menu for awhile; how long I don't know.  All I know is I went there one day after the name change, and there were no peppers, at least not anything close.  I still ordered a sub, but it just wasn't the same without 'em.  I quit going to Tucci's for over a year.  One day I thought I'd give it another chance and guess what?  THE PEPPERS WERE BACK!  Now, they are still NOT the same brand that the \\"D\\" guys use; I've done my research, I KNOW what brand the originals are, and where to get 'em.  They are available, and they are slightly better, but only slightly.  What Tucci's uses is similar enough that it can be overlooked. \\n\\nBut let's get to the food.  \\n\\nDespite the name change, it's the same, excellent choice of hot and cold subs.  Great bread, quality meats,fresh veggies, and laid-back atmosphere that reminds you that you are an AUSTINITE, and you are in AUSTIN.  To steal and alter the \\"other guys\\" slogan: \\"NO GRANITE HERE!\\"\\n\\nYou can't go wrong with ANY sub at Tucci's.  My fave is the SOUTHSIDE ITALIAN GOURMET: Prosciutto, Capicollo, Peppered Ham, Salami, Provolone cheese, and fresh veggies.  Me, I SKIP THE PICKLES and just have them load me up with the HOT & SWEET PEPPERS.  BEST SUB I've ever had ANYWHERE, time after time.  There's also a special way they TUCK the sandwich that keeps all the veggies on the sandwich, not on your plate.  Not only is it neater, but I personally think it makes a difference in the TASTE cuz of the way the ingredients are layered.  If ya never been there, you'll see what I mean.  Ya might say it \\"melts in your mouth, not in your hand!\\"\\n\\nFave hot sub?  The PHILLY CHEESESTEAK.  I'm a \\"cow-nivore\\", so I've never had the chicken.  No jalapenos for me, thanks.  Onions & Mushrooms?  Bring 'em on!  On this one, I can go either way regarding the peppers.  Somitimes I do, sometimes I don't.  Excellent cheesesteak either way.  To a purist, this is not a \\"traditional\\" cheesesteak (that would be with Cheez Whiz).  But every bit as good as.\\n\\nOn improvement Dave made that the \\"other\\" sub shop doesn't have is a larger selection of condiments than before.  Try your sub with Garlic Mayo, or Chipotle Mayo; very tasty.  Only on the cold subs, though; I don't think that would work well on a hot one.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  Tucci's Southside Subs are the BEST you'll ever have.  I just listed my faves, but they have a full range of meats, also veggie subs and salads.  Prices are affordable, your sub is made to your order, right before your eyes.  And service is FAST.  Also great PARTY TRAYS you can take home (order ahead for this).  What could be better than a tray of Tucci's subs, your best bro's, and watchin' the game?  Don't get mo' betta!  OK, maybe a beer to go with everything...\\n\\nI'm glad Dave went independent after leaving Delaware.  If not, there wouldn't be a decent sub shop AT ALL on this side of town, and I'm not kidding!  The other former Delaware franchisee I mentioned?  That place turned into a SUBWAY!  Gag me.\\n\\nPlease check out Tucci's RIGHT NOW!  Truly an Austin original.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nlarrythediner"},{"name":"Your Mom's Burger Bar","address":"1701 E Cesar Chavez St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've eaten here close to dozen times and found out about through yelp, have always enjoyed my burgers, love the fresh cut french fries, staff and owner have always been friendly and happy to be there.

(That does not make this review unreliable because HH here is bomb - 4:30-6:30 every day).\\n\\nHappy Hour Obsessions:\\n\\n$4 Duck Fat Fries: Okay, honestly, the serving size for this isn't too big (I could probably eat this by myself + two tacos, but that is just me). BUT: 110-minute egg & cold b√©arnaise. What does that mean?! A 110-minute egg is an egg yolk that has sort of a thick, goopy texture, a bit goopier than a soft-boiled egg. B√©arnaise is an egg-yolk based sauce that is actually a type of hollandaise sauce - tastes a bit more vinegar-y and herby. I really like the aftertaste of these fries, sort of smoky. YUM, anyway I get these every time.\\n\\n$4 Milk-Braised Pork Carnitas Taco & Pork Belly Taco & Cornmeal Catfish Taco: I've had all three - my favorites are definitely the Pork Carnitas and Pork Belly, becasue they come wonderfully equipped with a fried egg, heh. The Pork Belly one is a little bit more fresh-tasting because of the arugula (even though, really, pork belly), and the Carnitas is heavier because of the parmesan queso. Take yo' pick. The catfish taco is also very good, but the times that I've tried it, the catfish is a bit small. :c Actually, these tacos are not the hugest - you may want to order two if you are feeling hungry.\\n\\nNon-HH Obsessions #becausedessert: I've tried almost every dessert here - a bit pricey and super heavy, but great nonetheless. My favorites are:\\n\\n...the Dark Chocolate Truffle Cake ($7.00): Tastes like a silky smooth dark chocolate bar, the perfect mix of solid and fudgy, and not too sweet. Drizzled with a raspberry sauce, and yes, it is perfection. Fair Warning: Do not microwave this if you are craving a warm cake - I melted mine into a puddle and had to stick it back into my refrigerator to resolidify. It was still delicious but NOT THE SAME.\\n\\n...Bananas Fosters Beignets ($6.00): Really, try this. I don't normally like bananas, but the beignets + cane syrup + honey + nutmeg ice cream is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy.

(And I hope this doesn't get 'filtered' again because it is a relevant review for any parent getting compounded medicine for their child)\\n\\nA little back story: My infant son was born with reflux.  Any reflux parent knows this is a tough journey.  Figuring out what medicine works, what best to feed your baby, up all night holding and rocking to control the pain in your baby.  \\n\\nWell, we did find a medicine that worked and it was one that People's pharmacy would have to compound.  It worked wonderfully at first but by day 15 we were noticing it wasn't as effective.  The pharmacist agreed to fill my RX every 10 days which worked---at first.  I started noticing I'd pick up a refill and my son seemed worse on a 'new batch of medicine'.  After calling, I found out I was being given a compounded medicine made 9+ days before I called in to refill it.  \\n\\nI politely explained that my son needed a fresh batch made.  When the medicine was old, he'd have a horrible acid flare up (screaming, in pain, arching his back and not able to sleep--essentially his esophagus is getting damaged).  The pharmacist agreed to remix it even though she guaranteed it would be a waste of money, claiming the PH balance was just fine.  I paid out of pocket for the fresh batch to be mixed and it was just as I suspected---my son was 100% better.  He needed his medicine to be compounded fresh to be effective.\\n\\nI thought everything was fine, since she had agreed to compound it fresh. Until I needed it filled again.  This time she said no. (?!) I begged them to compound it for me fresh and after going back and forth she agreed but to come back in a few days (so two days of severe pain for my son).  \\n\\nThe next time I called to have it refilled, she said no again.  I brought in my son so she could see this is a 5 month old BABY we are talking about.  She seemed to enjoy holding the power in her hands to make the decision to compound the medicine fresh.  She insisted she couldn't, that she  had to move the product on the shelf before mixing a new batch.  When I reminded her that she had done it before, she said this time she couldn't.  Never mind that my son was in severe pain and all it took to make a baby feel better was to compound the medicine for him fresh.  She told me it could possibly be me nursing him (I don't feel like it was her business or right to give me advice on that--but when I told her I already switched him to a sensitive formula, she then said perhaps I should seek alternative medicine.   I don't understand why she thought it necessary to give me medical advice when we already see a pediatrician and a pediatric gi for my son's condition--all we needed was his medicine compounded when I needed a refill).\\n\\nReluctantly, she agreed to fill it if I came back again the next day.  \\n\\nI thought we finally ended the drama and she'd be willing to do this for my baby.\\n\\nUntil the next refill.  This time when I called the person who answered the phone said the pharmacist said no.  Sigh. Again.  I begged.  I pleaded.  She checked again with the pharmacist and she came back with this response: \\"She said she'd mix it fresh for you but you'll have to pay extra\\".  WHAT?!?!?!?!  \\n\\nI couldn't believe my ears.  Pay extra? To refill a medicine that I was already having to pay out of pocket for because of the frequent refills?  I've never heard of a pharmacist demanding extra money to refill a prescription.  Was she going to pocket it? It felt like extortion.  She knew I needed this medicine desperately and was willing to pay anything.    I've never ever seen such an ego in one person.  Apparently the power of mixing medicine that a little baby is in need of went to her head.  So sad.  \\n\\nTo the pharmacist who made my life miserable and my baby suffer: \\"When a medication is compounded, the PPI granules/beads are suspended in a buffer solution (generally a neutralizing bicarbonate) to help prevent stomach acid degradation. However, many pharmacies do not add enough buffer to protect the PPI. Furthermore, the medications do not handle being in such an altered state and can degrade much more quickly. The active ingredient then becomes inactive and ineffective in a short time period than the dispensed thirty day bottle (typically 5-7 days according to studies done by the Midwest Acid Reflux Children's Institution). Our suggestion is to find a pharmacy that specializes in compounding custom medications and have them fill the script for you.\\"  I know you think you know everything.

The two were unclear what I wanted with the word 'roaster', but soon served up a bird from '15 minutes earlier' (I was skeptical) even though the rotisseries were empty. It smelled great and looked okay although the same as all the others. I grabbed a creamed spinach to snarf in the meantime --- sizable, value-priced, overly salty (maybe a parmesan sauce?), tasty and warm. Good quality. The other sides looked quite appealing as well, and one of the countermen was himself snaring on some greenbeans, so good on him. \\n\\nI took my bird home and to my shock and pleasure it was almost completely unsalted, honest, clean, tasting of good chicken only --- the famously great Costco value tastes brined aplenty, and the Globe report mentioned artificial flavoring when it contains nonesuch. I am not used to KFC but I don't think I have ever salted a prepared chicken before at home. I wonder if Boston Market get complaints about this honesty; they shouldn't. Anyway, I also peppered it a bit. No lemon. The skin had faint sweet sauce on it, but faint in the good sense. The bird's white meat was fine, even if there is not much you can do about white breast meat to begin with. The rest of it was even more delectable, and, again, honest and clean. V impressive. Smaller than Costco and twice the price, but from this single bird sample, I am going to repeat the experiment. \\n\\nYay for Boston Market, I say."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I have eaten at Tilt one time since I moved here.

They've gone through a name change and renovations here and there (I believe they used to be called Gino's but don't quote me on that). Located right on Orange Ave in a slim building, Gitto's is open at seemingly every hour, offering slices of pizza to the working class during lunch hour, and to the weary drunk college kids on late weekend nights.\\n\\nGitto's is small and kind of no frills. Downstairs is where the counter and ovens are, and there is a very tiny amount of space. You stand in line, pick your pizza, and decide if you want to eat it there or get it to go. If you're looking around the crowded floor wondering why I just said you could eat there, I wasn't being cheeky with you. Upstairs is a dining area for you dig into your ginormous slice of pizza. But again, it's no frills. There are plenty of tables and chairs to sit, but there isn't much decoration, and you're kind of left to your own devices up there (no one is going to come up to see if you want more food). \\n\\nI might sound like I'm underselling this place, but I'm not. Their pizza is actually pretty good. One slice of their New York style pizza is enough to fill you up for a while, and their pizza is made well. The crust and sauce are on point, and the cheese and toppings never sloppily fall off the pizza. \\n\\nTheir big selling point is probably also their biggest caveat. If you're downtown for work or pleasure, and you want to grab a quick bite to eat without having to wait a long time for service, Gitto's is a great choice. If you're not downtown, and you're just happen to be in the mood for some good pizza, there are several places outside of downtown that I could recommend that would save you the hassle of finding somewhere to park downtown and cruising your way through Orlandoans on the go. They're right across the street from the movie theater, so if you're going to see a movie and want to grab a quick bite to eat before or after the movie, Gitto's is highly recommended. If you're there anytime after 10pm, pay no mind to the drunken college kid who is about to pass out into their cheese pizza. Admit it. We've all been there at one point in our life."},{"name":"Chow Bing","address":"349 Decatur St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love the food here!  Healthy, fresh, and different.

Also, though I try to avoid chains in favor of local fare, I always appreciate that Vino Volo is pretty consistent across many airports. I've had similarly great experiences in Philly, Seattle, and MSP. Austin just happens to be home base.\\n\\nThe food is good. I am judging it against other airport foods I've had in my day, and grading on that scale I might even say it's excellent. Salads are fresh, rarely overdressed, and are a decent size for the price. Cheese plates tend to vary with the season, and feature interesting components. One of my long time go to dishes has been the lamb meatballs, which do a nice job filling you up but not feeling heavy- nobody wants to get into an airline seat feeling the bloat on its way. \\n\\nService here can be hit or miss, and at busy times the tables do fill up. The tables themselves are also quite small and a little cramped. This rarely bothers me when traveling alone, but larger/taller people or groups might struggle a bit more. \\n\\nUnfortunately, there is really no scenery or airport view-ability at this place. They have done a nice job of constructing their mini-restaurant to have a pleasant, rustic feel, but there are no windows and no way to watch airplanes move across the tarmac or take off and land on the runway.

Their opening/greeting is a mouthful, as they explain their goal and values as a restaurant -- their pledge for freshness and food served hot, etc, etc. We were given chips & salsa and because it was four of us, it didn't last long. Our server took our drink orders and the wait began. We sat a long time waiting for our drinks and for a refill on the salsa & chips, which we had to call someone else over to ask for.  We were so hungry and it'd been so long before our own waitress came back to take our order. Once that finally happened, we ordered the one price deal where we'd get one appetizer for the table to share, an individual meal and a dessert for the table to share (churros). \\nThe nachos were plentiful and good. My meal was tasty. I can't think of the name of it, but it was described as somewhat of a Mexican lasagna with chicken. It was good and I took some of it to-go and it hit the spot the next day. The churros were served with 3 different sauces (caramel, chocolate and raspberry). They were definitely hot and good with the sauces. \\n\\nOverall:  LONG wait times, very nice waitress, good food, good drinks, nice decor."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"2206 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is five minutes from my house, but I had never tried it.  A friend and i went on a Friday night at 9 pm, no wait and the guys behind the counter were very friendly.  We had the Athena pizza, which has spinach, feta, olives and tomato slices.  It was very fresh tasting and the sauce on the pie was outstanding!  I recently tried and loved Home Slice's pepperoni pizza and this wasn't quite as good, but then again, pepperoni is tastier, and less healthy, than veggies.  $10 each for a medium pizza and 2 drinks was a good deal.  The spinach dip at the next table looked great.  We also noticed they got a neighboring table's order wrong but gave them the \\"wrong\\" food for free and brought the correct order boxed up for later.

I was impressed that they were trusting enough to give every booth their own remote control, so we could watch whatever we wanted. This was a plus since pizza joints usually have some bad movie or sports game on their TV. None of that for us! \\n\\nThe pizza was tasty, I ordered their Margherita pie. The only suggestion I would make with their food is that they offer a variety of crust styles instead of just crust flavors. There were other selections of crust flavors to choose from, but the only problem was that they were thin crust style. Nothing wrong with thin crust pizza, but sometimes you want something that'll stick to your ribs longer. \\n\\nTo end it all, we decided to get some gelato. I had the mint chocolate chip, a personal favorite. The gentleman at the counter was nice enough to give us our gelatos pro bono, so that sweetened the deal. \\n\\nSince we went there a week after their opening night, they hadn't acquired their liquor license yet. So, that meant no booze for the time being. Perhaps I should go back another time when they have their license and see if the experience can be enhanced with a few brewskys.

I honestly think that KFC's chicken has more flavor than the chicken here. I had one breast a la cart and mac n cheese (which was ok, kinda dry but good flavor). My hubby ordered the chicken smothered in gravy which was recommended by the waitress and it not good. He says it was very, very bland. I didnt dare to try it cuz it smelled weird and didn't look appetizing at all....he had the yams which I ate, they were good. Nothing special just sweetened yams. I had the lemonade, it was good.

The scone was unbelievably dry, even with coffee! The cinnamon roll was undercooked in the middle and overall was a messy ball of dough. The chocolate doughnut was like eating a bike tire, and the maple doughnut although slightly more supple was also pretty tough.\\nI also have a general problem with the branding....anyone who is familiar with Babycakes NY or LA will understand what I mean. There is no way the owner is naive enough to not expect a comparison to be drawn between her business and the very successful one based in NY. The only problem is, while Petunia's charges the same as Babycakes for their dressed up gluten-free vegan treats, Babycakes delivers. \\nIt may be I made poor selections, the cakes looked tasty, but I believe if you are going to put it up for sale it better be worth my money.

This location just opened so I've cut them some slack on the fact they are slow as molasses but this trip I feel they are ready for a review.\\n\\nGot my food at 9:55pm. Waited over an hour. The same size line at the Hunters Creek location would be a 20 min wait maximum.\\n\\nTwo glaring issues I noticed.\\n\\n1. No executive operational oversight/accountability. You just opened a chipotle (one that is too small mind you) near disney and you can't bring in the proper guidance, support and help to get things done right? Are you that arrogant to think the brand will sell itself? Bring in a few operational SMEs from your corporate roll out team...have them stay longer if you did bring them out.\\n\\n2. Cashier was the bottleneck. She was giving a decent effort but wasn't working smart (see issue #1). She was refilling forks while people waited to pay. She was also not able pre-calculate multi-item orders in order to ask for payment, instead she literally waited for all items to be bagged before initiating the payment wi th the customer. This resulted in cashier engagement times upwards of 5 minutes on average for multi-item orders.\\n\\nI waited until the 5th trip here to review you guys to be fair. The staff were all good with the effort but they lacked an orchestrator (not their fault)."},{"name":"Ceili's Modern Irish Pub","address":"7311 Westminster Highway","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"The customer service is better than the food.

As the White Horse slowly transitions to a Rainey Street crowd, it is only natural that the food would nosedive. The beans taste worse than canned Rosarita beans; the guy at the counter lied to my friend that the tortillas are homemade; the French fries with queso seemed to be from a frozen bag and drizzled with Rico's or velveeta. I would suggest that you disregard all reviews from anyone giving this four or five stars. These are the worst tacos I've experienced in the U.S. Taco Bell is significantly better.

This was no Greek salad. It was tiny first of all, had no feta, no olives, a few tomatoes that were no where near ripe enough to be eaten, some pickled red onions and a small amount of some random, unpleasant dressing. Not only that, the salad was on arugula, which my friend hates, and the menu definitely did not call that out.  So for her, this salad was sad and also inedible.\\n\\nWe also ordered black iced teas.  Their black iced tea actually looks and tastes like herbal tea, causing me to ask the waitress if she had given me the wrong tea.

I was always intrigued, but usually ended up opting for a tried and true option instead.\\n\\nThat all changed this past week when I had an offsite work dinner for a group that had previously dined at Mamma Maria and wanted to go back again. There were about 20 of us in total, and we were set up in the Terrace Room, which has a nice view out over North Square. We were all ordering off of a preset menu, so I didn't get a chance to do much investigating into their whole range of options, but everything that we had was pretty good. I joined about half of the group in ordering the extra fancy Chatham cod with shrimp, calamari and risotto, and I think that everyone was fairly satisfied. \\n\\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I'm not what you would call a connoisseur when it comes to fish. My usual line of thought is either one of two things: 'hmm, this tastes good' or 'shit, this isn't gonna work.' Come to think of it, that tends to be my reaction when it comes to most food. Anyway, I'm happy to report that on this occasion, my meal was met with a resounding 'hmm, this tastes good.' The one downside, however, was that my cod was served without a bowtie or cummerbund, and I typically prefer to see my extra fancy food dressed for the occasion. Just something to consider for those readers whose standards are similar to my own.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd say that it was a pretty good dining experience, but it was a bit pricey- I was able to expense our meal, but I'm not sure I would come running back here to eat on my own dime.

And when I mean early, I mean latest, come an hour early! This line will defeat you mentally and drain you of all life in your hungry body \\n2) don't get the sides, they weren't that good! Avoid the cole slaw! Avoid the potato salad at all costs! \\n3) get the beef rib if possible, the pork ribs, and sliced brisket. Maybe some sausages.

Someone asked him about bitters and how they are used, I get that there are a gazillions of ways to use them and he could have given a few drink examples, instead he stared at the bitters and said 'drinks', muttered other non specific empty info and stood there. Then the customer asking the question felt awkward. I'm not a bartender and I could have given a shorter more informed answer than that. Breakfast came, clank, on the counter in front of us.

There were maybe 2 groups before us. Luckily we got to sit down for a table of two right away. I ordered the Bolognese and my friend got a custom pesto + prosciutto with the tagliatelle (long flat pasta). \\n\\nBoth dishes came but the problem was they got my order wrong; on the menu Bolognese is supposed to be served with the same tagliatelle pasta but it came with rigatone. It wouldn't have been a big deal for me to just eat it as is, but I did bring it to the waiter's attention and both he and (who I assumed was) the owner insisted the Bolognese came with rigatone. They checked the menu, apologized for their error, and I had to wait another good 5-10 mins for the correct order to come out.\\n\\nVerdict: 1) pasta did not taste good-- in fact, the texture was rubbery and somewhat resembling al dente? Very basic sauces, basic flavors. Nothing to rave about. I was pretty disappointed since I thought their advertised \\"homemade\\" pasta would really make a difference. It did not. Perhaps because of the way the pasta was cooked (which tasted underdone), or the actual pasta recipe (which seemed more eggy than normal), or the shape of the pasta. Across both dishes the pasta was cooked the same. 2) VERY overpriced for the quality of the meal, I mean $16.95 for pasta + meat sauce, really?\\n\\nThe only (somewhat) redemptive factor of our meal was the free dessert that was offered because of the server's mistake. My friend and I decided to share a slice of their homemade cheesecake with berry sauce. Again, it was nothing to tell mom and dad about.\\n\\nI'd rather make the trek out to downtown Boston to see what the hype is all about."},{"name":"Hy's Shrimp","address":"530 SW 205th Ave, Ste 400","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"I got butter garlic shrimp!

Since when do veggie burgers cost more more than a hamburger? I guess since Your Mom's started making them. \\n\\nI honestly don't mind paying $ for a really good veggie burger. In fact, one of my all time favorite veggie burgers is from Bartlett's. At $13 a pop, they would be a robbery if they weren't so damn good. \\n\\nAnyway, You Mom's veggie burger is disgusting. The patty tasted bitter and had a really bad aftertaste and texture. If it weren't for the bun, that burger probably would have been the worst veggie burger I've ever had. That bun kind of saved it. \\n\\nBesides the veggie burger, I made another huge mistake of ordering the sweet potato fries. I don't discriminate against sweet potatoes. I love them in all forms. But whatever You Mom's did to their sweet potato fries is criminal. \\n\\nCRIMINAL. \\n\\nThe fries were undercooked, so they were really hard and chunky. The cinnamon left a chalky, strange aftertaste in my mouth. And that shit they drizzled on top did not do the fries any favors. \\n\\nOverall, a major fail.

I liked the texture of the tortilla used. It had a nice chewiness. The chicken, onions, combined with the guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo made the taco tastier than the tacos you probably would get at a Mexican restaurant in Boston. The tacos are definitely 5 times better and tastier than Taco Bell's tacos, and they definitely do NOT use those really hard, and overly crunchy pre-made U-shaped taco shells that you see in \\"Americanized tacos\\". These tacos are fairly inexpensive, about $2 per taco, and I think 3 of them should be enough to feed a hungry person. \\n\\nChimichangas are these deep fried burritos. What I like is that they really fill up the Chimichanga with a lot of beef and cheese. I thought I had the tastiest Chimichanga so far. I liked the crisp and chewy texture on the outside, and the warm chewy beef along with the gooey cheese on the inside. Rice and beans were decently good. The guacamole provided made the chimichanga and the rice tastier, and the good part is that this place does not charge extra for guacamole, unlike other Mexican food take away places. The pico de gallo is also tasty as well. \\n\\nThis place is at a really good location. It is near the Maverick stop off the MBTA Blue Line, which is probably the best subway line Boston can offer.

While in a hand with another player after the river, a player (not in the hand) urged the player in the hand to call me, stating his opinion about me bluffing (the guy talking, folded post-flop, but pre-turn, and pre-river). You could tell the guy still in the hand was about to fold - had his cards in his hands, ready to throw them in the muck. But this other guy's urging kept him in...and he called my bluff. I said something about it, and the dealer got all bent out of shape. This is because the guy who wasnt in the hand making his comments frequents the place daily and spend$$$. \\nAt the end, I got lectured by one of the heads of the poker room about keeping a lid on it when really, they should have been checking the dealer for helping a potential collusion situation take place.

They were asked right away whether they wanted a menu. We had been waiting for 5 minutes and had to ask the guy on the way back to get us our menus.\\n\\nAfter quickly deciding on what to eat, we waved down a server but she said that our own server will take our order, which is fine. I waved down our server and when she finally came, she actually walked around us to go to the the other couple first, who were FURTHER AWAY from her before coming back to take our order.\\n\\nWhen our drinks finally came, she put all our drinks on a tray and again, walked to the further table with a tray full of drinks instead of dropping off ours first (seriously this had to be intentional to some degree because why would anyone take a full tray further than they had to when they can make it easier by dropping off half of the content first), and then proceeded to even get that wrong by giving our drinks to the other couple. Then she proceeded to give us waters, and the exact same thing happened.\\n\\nThen because she took the order first from the couple that came later, our food literally did not come until they had FINISHED THEIR FOOD. They were also asked how they were doing within 5 minutes of getting their food, and at least 2 times after that (I noticed because obviously I still had not gotten my food and was getting bored and annoyed), while we were asked only when we were basically finished. So basically I came before this other couple and did not get our food before they finished theirs.\\n\\nThe only reason I could think of for all of this was that I looked like I wouldn't tip as much. Let's be real, Asians on average probably don't tip as much (I myself usually tips 15-20% depending on service though), so this is honestly not the first time I got shafted on service (this has happened enough times for me to think that this is not a one-off). However, I've never had an experience as blatant as this, and I've never had a meal where I was actually pissed off at the service, because I see that they actually DO provide good service to others, like the other couple.

The hot pepper chicken was great - lots of ginger in there, adding to the flavor. Thick slices of fresh garlic, somehow miraculously sweet despite not having been cooked very long... that's a neat trick.  LOTS of hot peppers in both, and this isn't the kind of place that says \\"would you like your dish that is clearly marked 'spicy' to be mild, medium, or hot?\\" It's not dripping-sweat hot, but it's got some bite.

I wasn't feeling very well so i ordered online via foodler and asked for a delivery even though its about a minute walk from my house lol. I ordered a grilled chicken combo sub with bacon onions peppers and cheese. When the delivery man got to my house he called me to come downstairs ( do delivery drivers ever come to the door anymore?) and made a remark about how he \\"literally walked here\\" like it was ridiculous I had it delivered, although true he spoke in a pretty rude tone. When I got in I opened the sub and saw that they had given me a steak and cheese combo instead of chicken but everything else was  how I ordered it except there was literally one teeny tiny bite sized piece of bacon on a large sub- kindve ridiculous since  they charged me extra for it.I ate it because whatever I like steak and cheese too lol and I figured it was a mistake with the Foodler online order-to be sure I checked my receipt but no everything had been sent through exactly how I had ordered it they just made it a steak and cheese for some reason. Today I decided I would call to order just in case and pick the order up myself. I ordered a large grilled chicken with cheese onions peppers and lettuce with mayo. When I took the sub home I found it was loaded with diced tomatoes (I hate tomatoes) and barely any onions or peppers.

Beautiful interior constructed with natural materials, mood lighting (but not too pretentiously dark that you can see each other and the food you are putting into your mouth), and very friendly, helpful, and genuine staff.  \\n\\nTHE FOOD REVIEW: My friend and I ordered 4-5 dishes off the happy hour menu ($4-5 dollars each!) and shared them all so we could try a little bit of everything.  The fried chicken is OUT of this world - crispy skin with succulent and juicy meat on the inside, smothered in a honey sauce and served with a biscuit.  My next favorite had to be the pork belly tacos - everything about that was momentous.  The pork belly was a beautifully cut (not overly fatty and jiggly like how many other restaurants prepare), and it was tender and perfectly cooked.  It was topped with an over easy egg and swaddled with a freshly pan-heated homemade tortilla.  The flash-fried brussel sprouts were airy and interesting to eat, although I was most impressed that someone or some kitchen gadget separated each layer of the sprout for this one-of-a-kind presentation.  The duck fat fries were thick, hot, and seasoned just right - make sure you get the duck fat fries off the regular menu if you want that egg on top:)  \\n\\nFellow Yelpers, friends, and foodies - we have been complacent far too long with mediocre food and trendy chains.  Salty Sow shows us how food should be done, and what honest food could be, all with local & sustainable ingredients.  Incredible and WORTHY gastronomical experience.  Bravo, Salty Sow.  I will be back for more, time and time again."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Literally everything we had was so amazing.

Every single time that I come to Atlanta, I make it a point to stop by Gladys Knight's. To come to the south and not have some amazing food is an abomination, and I refuse to miss out on this opportunity. Gladys Knight's provides me with an amazing meal, and it's so good that I always leave wanting more.\\n\\nChicken & waffles. What a combination that is. Now I've had Roscoes before, and their chicken & waffles is pretty decent, but Gladys Knight single handedly beats it. First of all, the restaurant itself just looks a little nicer. From the soothing music to the soulful decor, this place is made to be a spot where you come to get a nice dinner. For me, I'm here for the Midnight Train (chicken & waffles). The Midnight Train comes with about 4 pieces of chicken and one waffle. Now when I think waffles, I think Eggo. The waffle here is definitely not an Eggo waffle. It is nice and soft, and has a nice creamy flavor to it. There is no grainy, dry flavor that comes with mediocre waffles. On top of that, the fried chicken is amazing. Once you bite into it, you get that nice crispy skin, and then an amazingly juicy piece of chicken. Gone is the greasy fried chicken that you'd see at other spots. This fried chicken is perfectly made and has tons of flavor in each bite. \\n\\nNow if the Midnight Train isn't your cup of tea, I also found the smothered chicken to be an amazing substitute. Instead of having plain fried chicken, it now has gravy lathered all over it, giving it an added bump of flavorful goodness. To even kick up your meal a couple notches, you must go with some sides and a cup of sweet tea. My favorite sides have to be the candied yam and collard greens. Sure, the candied yams are sweet, but it is simply amazing. With the collard greens, it balances out my meal and makes it sort of healthy. \\n\\nAll in all, Gladys Knight's is the place to be if you want a nice plate of chicken & waffles. The service is great, decor is nice, and the food is amazing.

I don't find that romantic at all if you have to speak LOUDLY just for the both of you and your date to hear each other. at it is like you are in a marketplace ambiance rather than having to eat in a real quite and romantic dinner. the service is underwhelming for such a highly recommended fine dining restaurant. the norm for such food service is 30 mins and our simple order took over an hour just to get served. as a practice, anything that is considered poor service is immediately served with complimentary menu as a form of making up, we received none. the food was very good but find it very little/small and unsatisfying especially for the price we paid for. the waiter was ok but we had been served better.\\n\\nmy review is based upon comparison with other restaurants which were better overall. and I can't see Lupo can better them on all the categories that are important for me for a high end restaurant.\\n\\nfood quality = good to excellent (although I had better)\\nservice = mediocre\\nefficiency = poor\\nambience = poor\\nnoise level = disturbing (not as described to be romantic and average unless you have the place all to yourselves)\\nprice = undeserving for a fine dining restaurant\\n\\nthere are a lot of better and romantic restaurants and Lupo is not one of them."},{"name":"Hunan House Chinese Restaurant","address":"2350 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"We had not been there for 8 years and were dying to return for orange chicken.

The hostess advised that they typically recommend reservations on weekends. The decor is classy, refined and very white table cloth. It feels expensive and the service is attentive and friendly, extremely accommodating and never pushy. They offer a large assortment of daily specials, though with a tendency to run out of the more popular dishes later in the evening (consider 8pm late). I really loved how they offer the pasta dishes at full or half sizes, since sometimes those rich dishes can be too much to handle. My green salad ($6) and half sized Bison Bolognese ($11) was simply perfect. The pinot grigio that I drank throughout the evening was also crisp and citrusy ($7) and was the perfect recommendation from our server. \\n\\nWe stayed after the meal and drank more, never feeling rushed along.

We thought - we've never seen this place before, so why not explore it? Great idea, because since then, I've been back again and again and again. This truly is a gem of a restaurant in the Collingwood neighborhood, and I'm so glad that it's only a 10-minute walk from where I live!\\n\\nWahh Tee is a clean and tiny restaurant that's just a few minutes north of Joyce Station. I'd guess that it would snugly fit 16 people? I've been here on weekdays and weeknights already, and every time I've been here, the restaurant is half empty. This is sad, since the food here is truly delicious! If more people *knew* how amazing this place is, it would be packed every night.\\n\\nAs I recall, I've had the fermented tea leaf salad, pennywort salad, beef curry, seafood curry (curries come with a choice of two rice - coconut or biryani), coconut milk soup (with seafood, not chicken), noodle salad, fish noodle soup, vegetarian fried noodles, beef fried noodles, and vegetarian fried rice. Some dishes come with a small, spicy side salad, while other dishes (the rice ones, I believe) come with a side of shrimp sauce.\\n\\n(Note: The shrimp sauce is absolutely amazing, and I would put it in everything if I could. Too bad they only provide a small quantity of sauce, though fortunately - I believe they sell these sauces in containers in the restaurant.)\\n\\nThe dishes were all so flavorful, but my favorite ones had to be the beef fried rice and the tea leaf salad. The tea leaf salad is crunchy and slightly bitter, while the beef fried rice is just heavenly! The Burmese definitely know how to combine the spices and herbs to create memorable dishes.\\n\\nThe price of dishes here are fairly reasonable, with most dishes ranging from $5 to $11. The portions are decent-sized too. I can probably finish one dish myself, but with more people, I'd recommend trying as many dishes as possible - perhaps one from each category. The dishes tend to come out relatively fast, probably because of the low amount of customers. The first dish came in less than 10 minutes, for instance.\\n\\nSince the restaurant is small, it usually only has one waiter or waitress at all times, and when the staff show up late, it's usually the chef who also waits on tables. There was one staff/chef only, during two of the three times I was there.\\n\\nAll the staff there are super nice. I've had delightful interactions with the staff there each time I went. One of the waitresses even taught me how to say \\"goodbye\\" in Burmese!\\n\\nAll in all, I would highly recommend Wahh Tee. The food is flavorful and prices are reasonable.

Since the MBTA was an epic failwhale, per norm, I made the trek from the bus stop in Copley Square up to Charles St.  So upon first sight of the yellow sign above the door I made my four-inch stilettos move as quickly as possible -- immediately I was welcomed by a bright, spacious dining room, and five of my colleagues.  The back wall of the bar is quite possibly the largest wine rack I've ever seen, which could also be part of the restaurant's theme.  Enoteca can be interpreted several different ways, but a few of the most common are \\"wine shop\\", \\"wine bar\\", and \\"wine library\\".  The wine selection was incredible; our group included a few wine connoisseurs who were impressed and satisfied with their options.\\n\\nBut on to the food.  My roasted chicken breast was stuffed with spinach and ricotta, and served with a carrot-potato gratin.  Oh my, it was fabulous!  The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the gratin was a work of art (if I had been able to I absolutely would have snapped a picture).  Interestingly enough, my five colleagues all ordered a veal chop which disappeared instantly -- I assume there were no complaints with their meals either.\\n\\nWe finished off the meal with coffee and dessert - a lemon torte topped with fresh berries was a perfectly light way to top off a heavy meal.

I didn't like them. They definitely had the signature Szechuan peppercorn taste, but I just don't like soft tofu - vastly prefer it fried, but that seems far from the norm in this part of the country.

The owner at Frangipani does have vegan options.  He makes a mushroom base for his sauces and curries that you can get if you don't want oysters or fish in your food.

The lunch prices and takeout are good options and two people can easily eat lunch for less than 20 dollars.\\n\\nThis is not the best curry in Beaverton (Red Curry Thai is better) but the prices are more reasonable here and you definitely get a lot more curry.

There was no option for no tip or imputing an amount yourself. I felt like I was forced to tip 15% or higher for serving myself (picking up food, drinks, utensils then bussing the table and separating everything). \\nThe main thing that bugged me the most while eating there was how they used the cloth rag stuff as napkins.

We went down a corridor into the rear dining room, and there were three sets of diners there and a handful of people at the bar (shockingly empty for such a large room, still). \\n\\nWe ordered a cocktail and a glass of wine to start, from cheap plastic-covered menus, and waitress came out later and apologized that our drinks were still being made (they obviously weren't busy -- I have no idea). We shared an appetizer -- no better way to describe it than a pair of miniature mushroom and cheese burritos ($12). It was good, but, still, just not noteworthy. The entrees (steak and fish ~$23 each) were attractively presented, and good (but not delicious). The fish was fairly bland, and the side of wilted greens was pretty uninspiring for the price tag. No real complaints about the taste -- just not what I was expecting at all. \\n\\nTo top it all off, towards the end of our meal, the manager's large dog ran around the restaurant, sniffing our legs under the table, barking, and basically causing a scene.

Great atmosphere, great cocktails & great service.\\n\\nWhen seated at our table, we were left alone for an hour. No bread, drinks, etc. When our waiter finally came to our table, we joked \\"where have you been?\\" His answer: \\"I got the vibe you guys wanted to be left alone.\\" It was another hour before we got our food. Since our waiter, Jon, was no where to be found, we were being served bread & water from Miles, who was very attentive to our table whenever we asked him for something. \\n\\nWhen speaking to the manager & telling him our disappointment, we were given two free desserts. By this point, we had been at the restaurant over 3.5 hours and were just ready to go. I would have more appreciated them taking something off of the bill.\\n\\nWe left and headed back to the valet stand to pick up our cars and learned there is a $6 charge for valet. No where was there a sign or any indication of this. I don't mind paying for this service, but as someone who doesn't carry cash, this should be told up front.

We arrived and had a seat in the bar area waiting for the rest of our party of 6.  Of course, I immediately check in on YELP since, well I just do.  Upon checking in a YELP Check-In Offer of a \\"special free drink or appetizer\\"  displayed and i showed our server who was there getting our wine/drink order and asked if I could use it.  He said \\"I don't know, i'll have to check with my Manager since I don't know anything about it\\".  In short, this was the last time it was ever acknowledged and I simply don't make scenes or re-ask - i just remember.    Maybe it's just me, but YELP is a pretty great marketing tool and I would THINK it would behoove Shula's to acknowledge it, but let's just move on.  Even with the YELP 'issue', the server was good - fairly efficient and friendly.  We ended up staying and eating dinner in the bar area since their happy hour doesn't happen in the main dining room we were told.  Appetizers that were ordered by some in my party came out and they appeared to be quite good.  I had been eyeing the Hot Hot Chicken (I don't eat beef nor do i eat alot so the smaller the better), but some how when I was trying to order i was redirected to the salad with salmon - not sure how or why that happened, but that's how it went.

If you don't mind waiting half an hour for them to make the chicken, then by all means, go ahead and make a special order. The reason is because they don't have much left over from the lunch rush and need time to prepare the chicken for dinner rush.

They have patio seating, but Friday was a little dark and little cool. Inside it is. When we entered, there is a sign saying please wait to be seated, but since it wasn't busy, the server told us to sit anywhere. We chose a booth near the front, below a tv. The Olympics opening ceremonies were on. There was no sound. I did not get the gist of it.\\n\\nWe were given menus and told about the daily burger specials. Oh, how I wish it was Saturday... the Friday burger sounded really spicy, so I chose the Breaky Burger. Hollandaise on a burger? Cool beans. My husband got the one with all the cheeses. He also ordered the beer on special... some sort of wheat ale for $3.95. My fountain coke is $2. Normally, I hate fountain... always so disappointed, but this place is new... sometimes when taps are old, the pop has a weird, funky taste... like coke mixed with a little bit of cranberry. It could be that everytime I have ordered a pop, that somebody has gotten a vodka cran before me, but I swear, that's what it tastes like. I like cans of pop. This was okay. More fizz than usual. They do have glass bottled coke, but I prefer cans. I'm weird.\\n\\nThe burgers came pretty fast. The place was a bit empty, so it was a reasonable amount of time. They came in the little plastic baskets with a side of fries. The fries were really oily to me... and kind of cardboard-y. Not my favourite, but maybe if they were slathered in gravy or that mayo? These seemed like they'd be sturdy fries for dousing with sauce. My burger was lovely... it had a fried egg, I think crisp ham (or soggy bacon) and Hollandaise sauce. I bit into the burger and the yolk burst. That's the best... The Hollandaise was really lemon-y and I wish there was more of it. I ended up pushing all the meat out of the bun as per usual. My bun was a little burnt on the inside... possibly because it was a really nice brioche that had lots of butter...It held up pretty nice and did not disintergrate. My husband was really happy about that so he complimented the server. He told us they are baked in-house in their commerical bakery downstairs.

We arrived late because of the Austin Pride activities, but had no idea that navigating through downtown was only the start of our frustration. Our server was training a newcomer, but really should have had additional training herself. So I've compiled some tips for her:\\n\\nTraining tip 1: People ask a lot about the food at restaurants that they've never eaten at. You've got to know your stuff and keep the modifications in order no matter how complicated or ridiculous they are.\\n\\nTraining tip 2: If you bring water for a few people at the table, you need to bring them to everyone or you will be forced to run back and forth to the kitchen. Placing a pitcher of water on the table is even better.\\n\\nTraining tip 3: Remember to take everyone's order, but more importantly,\\n\\nTraining tip 4: Remember to put everyone's order in at the same time if they all ordered at the same time! Yes apologies are noble, but it doesn't change the fact that someone's food is delayed in a major way. What is worse is that the manager TONY never came over to apologize and told me at the end that he didn't know what was going on.\\n\\nTraining tip 5: If you know that you eff'd up, take the proper measures to rectify the situation. Send your manager over and take the order from the bill. Note: no one is trying to get free stuff, but it's a nice gesture when you haven't done your job.\\n\\nTraining tip 6: Don't lament to your manager that your customers are \\"being a headache\\" simply because they are asking for you to do your job. The manager TONY used this as an excuse for not offering some type of recourse for the fact that one of the people in our party got her pizza 30 minutes after everyone because the server forgot to ring it up.  \\n\\nI am not a restaurant complainer because I understand the work (and patience) that it takes to be successful in the service industry. I understand that sometimes you are dealing with folks that are looking to get things for free the minute they sit down. But you can't do a subpar job and expect folks not to act (tip) accordingly. Unlike LeSean McCoy (who was within his right to do what he did if his service was anything like ours), I didn't withhold a tip. Even after TONY, the manager called the police in on us... I just checked my account and there is an additional $16 that I need to speak to them about.

So the Mine Frire is a stir fried yakisoba noodle dish, and I think it is probably the one dish from Chez Dodo that really embodies most of the influences of African, French, Indian, Chinese and Creole cuisines that you see it proudly labeled on the cart.  The Indian and Chinese influeces were pretty obvious from the chutney and the stir fried noodles.  It's the other 3 influences that will have your brain guessing what is what.  Eventually I gave up trying to figure out and just went with it.  It really is this mix mash of savory flavors for the noodles and chicken, then you add the refreshing chutney and somehow it all makes sense.

We were brought our waters promptly and menus. All normal stuff that you'd expect.\\n\\nHere we go.\\n\\nWe sat there waiting for our server to come take our order for about 15 minutes. Ok no big deal, she might be busy. We order our food and wait. I ordered a papaya salad with grilled chicken and the \\"crying tiger\\". I patiently wait for maybe 30 minutes for my food to arrive. \\n\\nThe Crying Tiger is grilled skirt steak with a special sauce and salad. \\nThe meat was so rubbery I couldn't believe it. I am adventurous eater of many exotic meats, but it's was rubbery like nothing I've experienced before.\\nThe sauce was way too sweet. A theme that will be apparent throughout this meal. I suck it up and cut the steak into tiny pieces to compensate. \\n\\nMy papaya salad comes with sticky rice. Which I was interested in sampling.\\nI am of Thai and Laotian decent so I wanted to see what this dish would bring. The sticky rice was so under steamed that it just fell apart when I tried to grab it. I still said whatever and moved on to the papaya salad. It felt like eating a desert since the sugary sauce over powered everything about this dish. I added some chili peppers and sauce to try and balance it out. I really was disappointed at how bad this entree turned out. Looked pretty though.\\n\\nIf you're looking for something authentic, Thai Bloom is definately not the place you want to go. Bad service and sugary overtones in all their sauces and flavor profiles. I was disappointed because I expected something normal. What I got was below average.

Your Mom's Burger Bar was next up in the rotation for our ongoing \\"Burger Exploration Series\\" at the office, and though I loathe all things downtown, I was excited at the prospect of trying out an, as yet, undiscovered locally owned dining establishment.\\n\\nThe experience started benignly enough, with all of us lounging comfortably in the semi outdoors dining area, waiting for our orders to be taken.  After sitting down I was filled with dread to learn that I was the last to order, as last time this happened, I got my burger a full 30 minutes after everyone else was finished.  Ironically, I was the first person to receive my order, and it just gets worse from there.\\n\\nThe waitress was a train wreck.  She took down everyone's orders, but apparently forgot to map them to tables or individuals, as she would come out periodically and ask \\"who had such and such order?\\"  Our group was so big, that there were several similar orders, and out of 20 some odd people, I was the only one that received their order correctly, and I am fairly certain that's because my order was not taken by our waitress.  Things got so bad that at one point, the waitress got into an argument with one of our party about whether or not his order was correct.  Really???? The aging waitress who has to remember 25 orders is going to argue with the guy that only had to remember the one thing he ordered, against the backdrop of ALL the other incorrect orders in our party.  You've got to freaking kidding me. \\n\\nThe burger was a good idea (cheese in the middle) but the execution was poor, the cheese was the lowest quality American cheese food product substitute, and every bite was accompanied by a cheesy, greasy money shot of government cheese into the facial hair.  The taste was ok, but being conditioned to wince every time I took a bite became tiresome.  The fries were soggy and waxy, which was yet another disappointment.\\n\\nThe crazy thing is that the person that ordered last (me) got his order first and by the time I was done, had socialized for a bit and left, the guy that ordered first still had not received his order.  Upon leaving, we were confronted with a business card holder on the counter that held the business cards of our waitress who is also a realtor, presumably for the sole purpose of pimping her vacation property in Port Aransas.   At this point the whole experience had deteriorated into what felt like a failed skit on low budget comedy show.  \\n\\nOur compatriot, Mark was the most adversely affected by the chaos as he had held court well into the wee hours the prior evening, and had neglected to take in breakfast.   His irritation level was nearing critical mass, and we worried that it might come to blows with the waitress.  When we left, we all got to observe one of the most marvelously awkward moments in dining history, where the owner, confronted with Mark's crushing disapproval, awkwardly asked if he worked evenings.  This was as confusing as it was frustrating for Mark, and we all wondered if the guy was going to offer to take Mark out on a date.  \\n\\nOne of the guys that ordered a veggie burger commented on how this was the best veggie burger he'd ever had, and upon inspection we determined that it was not a veggie burger at all, but rather a traditional bovine burger.  This did not stop the waitress from insisting that he had ordered and consumed 2 veggie burgers.  Finally, having suffered the slings and arrows of crushing disappointment, confusion, and insult, we managed to make our way to where I had parked my vehicle in their unbelievably poorly organized parking lot.  \\n\\nAs I was backing out of my space, the owner came running out in a fashion befitting the slow motion crescendo of an overdone romantic film, clutching a grease soaked back filled with a final to-go token of the owner's love and remorse for Mark's disappointment.  Mark quietly accepted the bag from the back seat and we drove off into the sunset.  The cherry on top of the entire experience, is that even though the free burger was run out to the car by the owner himself, it was still wrong.\\n\\nTo \\"Your Mom's Burger Bar\\" I can only say, \\"You shipment of Fail has arrived.\\"  I fully acknowledge that this review was heavy handed and over the top, but the experience was exceptionally bad.  I truly hope that this local joint gets it's act together so that I can review it again at some point in the future with some hope of it being slightly more positive."},{"name":"Spinners","address":"14106 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Been to this place when we were in search of bars late night.

They were your traditional deviled eggs with that hint of truffle oil which kicked it up a notch which made the dish go from okay to great. We also ordered the charcuterie board as an appetizer. It wasn't your typical charcuterie board with cured meats and cheese. This one had a very unique blend of different flavors with salmon, dill sauce, chicken liver, mustard grains, duck ham, andouille sausage, pickles, pickled onions, almonds, goat cheese and Gruyere. Every bite was worth the money. Husband ordered the braised beef shoulder and I ordered a double cheeseburger with duck fries. Hubby is a meat and potatoes guy so the beef shoulder dish hit the spot for him. My burger was delicious!

Unfortunately, it seems like they are still working out the kinks.\\n\\nFirst, the good news.  My pulled pork BBQ taco was gigantic and delicious.  The meat was a touch on the salty side, but the flavor was great.  I'm not sure where they're actually smoking this stuff, but it is going in the running for top five smoked pork spots in Atlanta.  It was very moist, with a good amount of bark, but not fatty at all.  One taco  with a side will be a satisfying lunch for the average eater, but hungry folks should plan on ordering two.  My side of jerked seasoned collards were a nice spin on traditional greens, and I would order them again.  The variety of barbecue sauces available was also appreciated.\\n\\nHowever, the delivery here needs to be worked out.  First, the first thing I see in your shop as I'm standing in line waiting to order should not be two giant, institutional sized containers of country time lemonade and three institutional sized cans of Bush's baked beans.  I'm not naive enough to think that restaurants with proces this low make everything from scratch, but if you're touting the lemonade and the beans as something special, I would really hope they're not shelf-stable.\\n\\nSecondly, the ordering/food prep operation needs to be examined.  The manager was taking phone calls during the middle of the lunch rush, but because they only have one phone line, the credit card machine couldn't process payments while she was talking.  Secondly, the one cashier was obviously new, as he had to look at the menu on the blackboard behind him several times to confirm that one, items people ordered were actually on the menu, and two, what their prices were.  There's nothing wrong with being new, but he was floundering while three cooks/food prep people stood idly by waiting for something to do.  They would be well served to add a second cash register and a second phone line, as the queue of people was scaring off additional paying guests.\\n\\nThe menu could also use a little streamlining. Some entrees came with two sides and a drink, some with only one side, some with a pre-determined side, some with sides you chose, at all sorts of random prices.  Generally, barbecue spots have you pick your entree (sandwich, plate, etc) and then come with a set number of sides for all menu items.  This would help with that cashier confusion I experienced, and cut down on the number of times he had to ask which additional sides people wanted.\\n\\nOverall, a good spot, but there are others in the Sweet Auburn Market that I plan to try before re-visiting."},{"name":"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen","address":"875 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Unfortunately this experience was not impressive.

Especially the seitan in the Ruben. (The texture and the seasoning were very meat-like.)\\n\\nBut, alas - nothing is perfect. Two things I noticed that were negative.\\n\\n1) The wait times are wild, if you go on a weekend night, expect to wait easily 40 minutes or more waiting for your food. The place is packed and often has a wait time to even get a table. (My ex-girlfriend at one point said she was so hungry that if the food wasn't coming in the next few minutes, she would have to leave and get something else to eat.)\\n\\n2) The first time I went, our waitress was awful. She was completely inattentive and unprofessional - but, for transparency, I spoke with the manager and he was very apologetic, polite, and professional. So I'm thankful for that at the very least.\\n\\nThe 2nd trip there, the waiter this time around was far better. He was polite and friendly and recommended options to my friends and myself.\\n\\nIn summary; the food is definitely great. It's an excellent spot for someone taking a vegetarian out on a date, or even just to have a new experience if you are someone like myself.\\n\\nI urge not to come during rush hours hungry though, you might starve. \\n\\nI would have given it a 2/5 - 3/5 in the end for the terrible waitress the first time around, but the manager was so nice and corrected the situation so well, I think it is all deserving of a 4/5. But, I hope the management is conveying this to their staff."},{"name":"Gitto's Pizza","address":"120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Was in Orlando for a few days and was looking for a quick bite to eat late at night and found this interesting pizza place. The place itself is very hole in the wall with a crowd of club and bar people which is a little expected at the time I was there. If you're trying to avoid that, maybe try some place else or go at an earlier time. There's no overhead menu but there are little paper menus that are scattered around the table. With how cramped it looks when entering the place, there is a good amount of seating upstairs.\\n\\nI'm not sure what this style is called but I've experienced this way in Rome as well, they have the pizza pre-made in a display case then you select your pizza and they heat it up for you in a couple minutes. It's a quick process and seems fresh enough to consume so no complaints here. I feel it's a better experience than a pizza that's sitting in rotating heating tray. This place also serves beer also just in case your huge pizza slice needs a friend.\\n\\nI can see this place not being everyone's cup of tea but I've enjoyed the experience and the people there were friendly.

It was just baked, crispy on the outside and soft, warm on the inside. \\n\\nFor dishes, I recommend the mushroom risotto, baked four mushrooms rigatoni, and the ahi tuna. The mushroom dishes were very creamy and delicious. The bread crumps on the rigatoni gave the whole dish a very interesting texture and I really liked it. For the ahi tuna, wow, never tasted anything like that before; this is a must try. The seared tuna was very soft and well seasoned, and it went very well with the potatoes at the bottom. The calamari salad was okay. The pickled vegetables were delicious and appetizing, but the calamari was plain and I was expecting fried calamari instead of steamed (?) ones. The sausages in Sunday macaroni was so good, but the rib and meat balls were very plain.

Then I had to watch her make the salad as she stared at each ingredient on the counter for about 5 minutes because she obviously doesn't know what is in it. I asked her to put feta cheese on it, but instead she put Parmesan cheese. Again because she DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.

That being said, the staff (and Auntie managing the front of the restaurant) almost exclusively converse in Chinese making it a bit more challenging for those that might struggle in that department. However do not despair; they do offer most of their menu loosely translated in English. I highly recommend dining here with an experienced speaker and familiar with the cuisine. The Auntie takes care of you as if you were eating in her home and will spend the time getting to know you. She's definitely a Chinese Chatty Cathy! \\n\\nHaving dined here for years during college and visiting now and then afterwards, I definitely enjoy the experience. The Cold Pig Ears (Áå™ËÄ≥Êúµ) dish was fragrant, spicy, and had a generous topping of cilantro (to my liking). Their dill dumplings (Ëå¥È¶ôÈ•∫Â≠ê) also tasted delicious. But this establishment falls short in a couple ways: \\n1) Some dishes were not quite authentic...for example the Xinjiang noodles (Êñ∞ÁñÜÊãâÊù°ÔøΩ? and Lu Zhu (Âç§ÁÖÆ - a Beijing pot with organ meats) lacked the right flavors but were still tasty. \\n2) Meat skewers are a bit shabby. For skewers that cost $1/$2, the amount of lamb meat is relatively little. We also got the Chicken Gizzard (Jane), and it was too dry and charred. Honestly a hit or miss, but this is one of the only places that offers chicken heart skewers.\\n\\nPerhaps it's the nostalgia, but this establishment offers food selections that still makes me want to come back. I hope you can enjoy this place like I have for one of my Buford Hwy stops. If you'd like to check out other places on Buford Hwy like this, Northern China Eatery and Chef Liu's offers similar selections.

My husband and I literally just finished a meal here and were beyond impressed.  \\n\\nWe just moved here from Southern California where we had our choice of good Thai food, but Thai Grille rivals the best we've had in SoCal.  We ordered three dishes for takeout - Pad Kee Mao, Massaman Curry, and Chicken Basil.  The Pad Kee Mao was not greasy, texture of noodles was just right, extremely flavorful, and just the right amount of heat.  The Massaman Curry had these cute little potatoes that were whole (so no potatoes falling apart in the dish), great flavor, and an interesting mix of vegetables - squash, potatoes, and even avocado.  \\n\\nThe best part is their use of fresh vegetables.  I fell in love with the Chicken Basil dish as soon as I bit into the eggplant.  Usually a Chicken Basil dish is just that, chicken and basil, but Thai Grille really makes use of a great variety of fresh vegetables including eggplant, squash, zucchini, snap peas.  \\n\\nAccording to my husband, the restaurant was maybe a quarter full, but we don't understand why there's not a line out the door.

Because it's a great place! \\n\\nI'd like to start with the issues I had. \\n1) With all of the staff wearing 'very nice, but essentially street clothes', it was difficult to determine who was staff and who was wandering or standing around. For instance, I had no idea the hostesses were the two girls chatting at the cash register desk until they asked if I'd been helped. 2) One of our group sat without a glass until I got up to get him one and the table was similarly upprepared with silverware and plates. These things were easliy rectified and really not a problem, but noticed. \\n3) There was a pricing issue with ourfinal bill. It was corrected after the server verified that she, in fact, did ring it wrong. Again, just a small issue corrected with a smile. \\n4) The flatbread crust was way over browned, cooked to a hard cracker consistency and the color of dark brown sugar, I am pretty sure that's not typical of a flatbread. It still tasted good and toppings were well dispersed, but the toppings weren't very hot compared to the crust being so over done. Weird!\\n\\nOK, I'm over complaining. Here's what's awesome about The Wine Bistro. \\n1) Great ambiance.\\n2) Comfortable Environment\\n3) Attentive, friendly, knowledgable service. She was able to suggest and educate without being a know-it-all. She made the experience easy and fun. \\n4) Yummy Wine Service. So many wines to choose from, you can actually shop for your bottle and the cork is for you for an $8 fee Weds-Sat. Monday and Tuesday, they wave the fee.\\n5) State minmum pricing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You enter Salem ST and you just walk on up for a little bit! Now I love the street its on because the street makes you forget that your in Boston. Not really any loud noise or anything of that nature! This is a plus for me. I enjoy this. Now as you walk up on from the street you will see the sign. \\n\\nAs we entered the building I quickly saw it was small! this isnt a issue at all! Its nice for its size! We where even greeted by 2 people as we walked in. For a Friday night it was around 6:30 and we got seated very quickly. After sitting down we got our menus and they took our drink order or and food orders! They gave us enough time to look at the menu and they were not pushy on time at all! They even answered any questions I had about the menu items. \\n\\nFood and Drinks:\\n\\nFor dinks they had a HUGE wine list! Now sadly me nor the girlfriend drink wine at all. If you happen to like Wine Im more than sure it is good. Just not for us. Its not bad but we didn't try any. We just got a few Dr. Peppers! Now having Dr. Pepper is a plus as many places don't carry it! They also serve beer. \\n\\nWhile looking at the menu you will find that it tells you what your ordering. So your not left with just a name. Also when we had questions the server was able to answer us clearly. Big help!\\n\\nWe ended up ordering an app of garlic bread and 2 meals. \\n\\nApp - The app was VERY good! It came out quickly and hot! Was ready to eat! They also gave us some very yummy Italian bread with olive oil with out ordering it. It was free on the side with every table. Id still recommend trying the garlic bread. They make it in house! Worth the order!\\n\\nMeals - We ended up getting 2 meals here. We got to share with each other.\\n\\nFirst meal we got was CHICKEN FLORENTINE! One thing you will notice is they give you a HUGE portion of chicken with a TON of pasta! It was made with light breaded chicken that they make them selves and Spinach, sliced Mozzarella and Tomato slices in a Marinara sauce. Its such a perfect combo! The chicken was cooked perfectly and the noodles where also! Its very good!\\n\\nSecond meal we got was Fettuccine Alfredo. Its such a good dish! Its cream sauce with Romano cheese and Fettuccine cooked together! The sauce is sooooo good! it really is one of the best I ever had!! noodles where perfect and the sauce made the meal!

Over all for what you pay for you really get alot! Make sure you come hungry or ready for left overs! I'm over 200lbs and I got dinner and lunch for a few days! \\n\\nOver all:\\n\\nWe both loved this spot! Its small and great for a nice date night! Its a dime setting with great food and service! I went in here not sure on how good it would have been. Over all its worth checking out if your in the area! Plus your in the north end!

Skip the sausage, pulled pork, pork ribs, coleslaw (and white bread - why would you possibly eat bread at a time like this?). Sob gently as you realize you wasted the previous XX years of your life eating not this. Wash away tears of joy with free beer. Hug loved ones and / or strangers.\\n\\nLong version - It's probably easy to write off a five star review from some NYC dude (who may or may not have already been partially impaired at 11am when eating here). And part of me hopes you will pay no mind to this or the other positive reviews and, instead, go stand in line with everyone else at Franklins. That way there will be no wait when I return. But that would be pretty selfish.\\n\\nBuddy and I on weekend mancation rolled by Franklins around 9:45am. Line already too long. Walked the few blocks over to La BBQ. 10am - no one there. We sheepishly entered the gate, unsure if we were in the right place. Chick at the trailer told us we were and invited us to help ourselves to free beer, via keg, while we waited until 11am open. Being dudes from NYC in our 30s, it took us a minute to comprehend free beer and then to recall keg functionality. Nonetheless, we procured our beer with minimal embarrassment (since there was no one else around).\\n\\nPeople trickled in as it drew closer to open and sat a picnic tables enjoying free beer. I started getting a bit anxious wondering how the queue would work since everyone was sitting down. Sure enough, right around 11 there was a semi frantic line formation including some shit talking between some bros that had been sitting for a long time and a bro that decided he was the front of the line b/c he was standing. Anyway, avoided that and got in line. There were still not a lot of people so it was more an issue of wait time than not being able to get certain items (i.e. the beef rib). Still, this could easily be avoided with a deli-style ticketing system so people could sit and chill rather than scuffle / queue.\\n\\nThe line moved quickly and as you get to the front you're handed a piece of brisket to try. This is where time slowed down and I entered some sort of meat-drug fugue state. As mentioned, I'm from NYC, which has undergone a pretty remarkable BBQ Renaissance over the past few years. I'm also originally from NC so I definitely know good swine based BBQ. So I didn't think I'd be blown away by anything in Austin. I humbly and happily admit that I was wrong.\\n\\nBoth the fatty brisket and the beef rib are insane. Moist smokey seasoned. Just ridiculous. My buddy said better than Franklins. I say better than about any other beef product on earth. The lean brisket was also good but the fatty is superior and isn't all fat like some places. The potato salad provided a very good break from the meat. The pork ribs were decent. The pulled pork, sausage and chipotle cole slaw were not good. But, that's not why you're there (hopefully).

This place just opened several days ago by two former waitresses who were very friendly and genuine.  The menu is simple with waffles (both traditional and whole wheat) with a variety of toppings.  Waffles are served like a falafel sandwich wrapped in foil and cute blue checkerboard paper.  \\n\\nI ordered the traditional waffle with fresh fruit and whipped cream cheese ($5).  The waffle was slightly sweet with a nice balance of vanilla.  My partner ordered the traditional waffle with eggs that he described as very custard like.

After church on Sunday I took my family and a friend (who had already eaten) there for the buffet.  There were 5 of us at the table, we had 4 buffets and 4 ice teas and an ice water.  The food was o.k.  Some items were very good, most were average and some items were awful;  especially the deserts.  In fact they were so awful that it was a joke at our table.  It went something like this:  \\"I triple dog dare you to take a bite of that cake\\".  Imagine aspartame, old coffee and Raid, but  worse.  We weren't rude and we didn't share our opinion with anyone outside our table.  Even my friend who didn't eat took a bite of cake to join in on the fun.  Our waiter who was MIA , never brought our check so i placed my credit card at the edge of our table to signal that we were more than ready to go.  The waiter walked by, pick up my card, still didn't leave a check,  but proceed with the charge on my account.  I was charged for 5 Buffets and 5 drink.  I took my bill to the cashier to correct the over site.  The extremely rude cashier blamed me for not being clear when being seated that one of our party was not eating. So when all else fail talk to management?   Management refused to refund for the buffet since my friend admitted to tasting the cake then walked away from me and into an office behind the cashier and closed the door.  My friend asked if she could just pay for the price of the cake slice and was told, \\"that's not how it works\\" .  I was told \\"I don't care if you ever come back\\"  and \\"it's your fault\\" and \\"you should not come to a buffet if your not going to eat\\".  \\n\\nI was refunded for 1 drink and left with a bad taste in my mouth."},{"name":"Marshall's","address":"1105 W 1st Ave","city":"Grandview Heights","stars":"3.5","text":"I always come in to Marshall's for breakfast.

Owned by LeAnn Mueller of the Mueller barbecue dynasty - responsible for Taylor's famous Louie Mueller Barbecue and producer of Bobby Mueller, perhaps the greatest pitmaster in Texas barbecue history - and manned by pitmaster John Lewis previous of Franklin Barbecue, La Barbecue excels at beautifully smoked meat. \\n\\nLewis uses his own custom designed and manufactured pit, the result of two years of trial and error design in his own backyard.\\n\\nJohn is a courageous guy; he changed EVERYTHING.  He uses only  prime grade, Black Angus beef briskets.  He cooks the brisket ONLY on his new smoker.  I know that you think of moist (fatty) as an option at most barbecue joints in Texas, but it's the ONLY option here at La Barbecue.  Moist, juicy, and falling apart on your plate, Lewis' brisket is exquisite; you can sense the influence of Aaron Franklin here, but this is without question John's own twist on things.  That Franklin-style bark is there, but the red smoke ring is more pronounced, and the meat so juicy it's out of this world.\\n\\nLewis' rub recipe is much more subtle than the old pepper-based  mix, yet the bark still provides a mouthful of smoke and salt with each  chew. The choice of higher-grade beef presents a richer, smoother  palette of meat and fat layers beneath the soft bark crust, with a  delicious, genuine umami that seems to be absent in so much brisket  elsewhere. There is nothing flat or boring about the flavor of this  brisket - it is eyes-rolling-back-into-your-head delicious and  irresistible to the last butcher paper speck. There simply is nothing  better in town right now.\\n\\n\\nThe brisket is tasty, but his homemade sausage is the real home-run here.   Instead of buying the meat, Lewis  and his team now hand-grind, mix, and stuff their own links. It's a medium grind, snappy, smoky explosion of a sausage, with that Texas spice driving home the flavor.  The red casings just go to show there's nothing that this man can do wrong.\\n\\nSo is it better than Aaron Franklin?  The sausage certainly is.  But is the brisket - the real definitive Texas barbecue dish - really better?  I'm not sure.  In my opinion it was so close I simply couldn't decide.  I think it might vary from day to day.\\n\\nIf this is the level of competition for barbecue in Austin, if the bar is *this* high, then it is a damn good time to be a Texan, ladies and gents.

Curiously enough, they appeared to have plenty of staff on hand but everyone seemed to be moving slowly without any sense of urgency whatsoever.\\n\\nWe were finally seated at a small booth with our 5th person sitting in a chair at the end of the booth that stuck out into the aisle.  We observed a larger booth that would have accommodated us perfectly go without bussing for several minutes and when our server approached us we asked to speak to a manager.  When we asked the manager to seat us at that booth he replied, \\"I can't because the hostess might be saving it for a larger party.\\"  Finally after another 10 minutes he told us we could move to the larger booth at which time we waited another 10 minutes before our server stopped to greet us and drop off menus.\\n\\nBy this time, we were all so annoyed we just wanted to order.

I have been there twice now, both times for take-out, since I currently live only about 10 minutes away.  Definitely call ahead to place your to-go order, at least 15 minutes before you get there, but if it's a crazy day for sports and/or you are ordering a lot, you may want to call as early as possible.\\n\\nLemon Pepper is typically my favorite flavor of wings, but I read that the Hot Ranch was a good one at Clay's.  So I've ordered half of my wings Lemon Pepper and half Hot Ranch.  Both times, I ended up thinking the Hot Ranch was WAY too salty.  And it's rare that I think things are salty, so that's saying a lot.  It will have you chugging water (or beer...  maybe that's the point) the rest of the day to quench your thirst.  Although the Lemon Pepper isn't the best I have ever had, it's very good.  Not nearly as salty as the Hot Ranch.\\n\\nThe 10-piece wing combo, which comes with Cajun fries, carrot sticks, celery sticks, and ranch (or Bleu cheese, but ranch all the way for me!) is a pretty great deal at a mere $8.49 (before tax).  I have to admit the Cajun fries are delicious, but you have to eat them fairly quickly before they turn soggy.  Since the wings are fairly large in size (not Taco Mac size but not small), I can make two meals out of the 10-piece combo.  Or, I can share with the hubs.  ;)\\n\\nAs previously mentioned, I have not dined in so I can't comment as to the service.  However, the place is pretty small, and the parking lot in front of the restaurant can fill up on a busy day.  You may want to carpool if coming with a large group to watch a particular game on TV.\\n\\nOverall, Clay's Sports Cafe gets 3.5 stars for their good wings and Cajun fries.

Keep a large table reserved and make sure that the people who have been waiting longer are seated first. A customer called the hostess out on this and the hostess made it seem as if the customer was over reacting. And then when she seated us, she apologized on behalf of the \\"ugly\\" customer. Very rude. Our waiter was very pleasant and greeted us immediately. We ordered regular pancakes, pecan praline pancakes, a latte and a coffee. We opted for disposable glasses because they smelled like eggy and we just couldn't drink the water that way. The drinks were okay. The pancakes were horrible. The pecan praline pancakes came almost burnt. It had a crunchy exterior. The praline sauce was good. The regular pancakes were so dense and eggs and heavy.

Good thing we did because the tables were pretty full (~1PM on a Saturday - you definitely could still walk-in and grab a seat though if you are a gamblin' man ... or woman).\\n\\nTo start, you are promptly served water and given a plate of warm, fluffy, light bread with a olive oil & balsamic dip. We ate two servings of this ... it was that good. We also split their take on a Caprese Salad. A very smooth bufala mozzarella served with a beautiful palate of tomatoes (green, orange, & red). The plate had a ring of balsamic around the outside and a perfect portion of fresh pesto underneath the magical mozzarella. Combine each individual aspect of this dish on your fork for the PERFECT bite! My only minor gripe was there were more tomatoes than everything else but that is to be expected.\\n\\nThe Boy's carbonara was great. He thought it was a little more alfredo-y/saucy than he liked - maybe because it lacked an egg - but the taste itself was still really good.\\n\\nI decided to give puttanesca sauce a first try here because I saw the word \\"spicy\\" in front of \\"puttanesca sauce.\\" Unfortunately, I did not know puttanesca sauce was heavy on olives; I found it to be VERY salty instead of 'spicy' although I have no other puttanesca experience to compare it to. That being said, I still enjoyed my dish, took home the leftovers, and finished it the next day ... albeit it, I threw a fried egg on top and called it breakfast.

I like my tea unsweetened, so I was pretty happy with it. The hojicha (roasted green tea) was refreshing yet cozy in taste, and the lychee tea was a surprise - you can really taste the lychee flavor even without any sweetness!

Lots of people are really into the matcha trend, but remember, they do have other drinks!\\n\\nWe also ordered a sampler of assorted cookies, which I think are a steal, compared to the pastry sampler.

So it gave me a chance to look at the reviews. Yelp 1st of course! A group of 8 of us(me being the only woman) and I just knew that I was going to see a plate full of pizza's on everyones plate but mine. But no. To my suprise our VP ordered the appetizers and they included hummus, shrimp and crab cakes and some bread. Okay so this was cool being that I was eyeing the menu days before and really wanted to try the shrimp and crab cakes. OMG. They were soooo delish. I could have had this as an entree. And why oh why were there just 2 to an order and they ordered just 3!!!! So we all split one. I didn't wanna share...couldn't they tell by the look on my face?? But anyway...the hummus was mild in flavor and the crab and shrimp cakes were filled with crab...not bready at all like you usually find. One of the guys ordered the greek salad which looked phenominal but of course you can not judge a book by it's cover. One of the guys ordered the meatloaf and apparently it wasn't that good because he was comparing it to someone else's. 2 of the guys ordered the deep pizza and it really looked sooo good that I was sort of jealous that I didn't order it...and I'm not even a big pizza fan of pizza. One guy ordered the scampi and I saw another noodle dish on the table as well. Well I was in the mood for some really good bisque. What I got was a big bowl of dissapointment and most agreed with me when they said their food was just ok. I got the shrimp bisque..the shrimp looked like the very small shrimp you find in the freezer. I also don't won't corn in my bisque...this kinda makes it chowder...it wasn't all that at all and it came with 2 pieces of bread that looked like stringbeans?? Very small.

Here's my critique:\\n\\n(1 ) The salad bar was very uninspiring. Not only was the room dingier than I remembered, but most of the food looked wilted and unappetizing (one exception: fried plantains. It is really hard to mess those up)\\n\\n(2) The menu said they would be serving 9 different types of meat, but I am pretty sure I only saw about 5. This is either a circulation problem or false advertising.\\n\\n(3) Chicken wrapped in bacon should NOT be the best meat you have. First of all, Brazilian BBQ is about *red* meat, and it's very disappointing when it is dried out and chewy. Second of all, bacon is cheating.\\n\\n(4) You are a Brazilian BBQ. You really should make sure the single Brazilian beer is always in stock. \\n\\n(5) I would really love a way to indicate when I am done eating. At most other rodizio establishments there is a stone or coaster with red on one side, green on the other, that you can use to communicate with the servers. At Midwest Grill there is no such thing, so you are constantly interrupted by the waitstaff. It makes it really hard to carry on a conversation.\\n\\nIn any case, the food is edible but given the proximity to Inman Square you can definitely do way, way better on both money and price."},{"name":"Mei Le Bakery & Restaurant","address":"112-100 Schoolhouse Street","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3","text":"New Chinese diner that took over the dim sum restaurant.

I stood at the front of one of the lines for about 5 minutes before the worker even looked at me.\\n\\nThe Local Pizzaiolo has a very limited menu for a pizza restaurant. The only option is thin-crust personal pizzas. There is no option to build your own pizza and all of the custom ones sound nearly identical. I ordered the Exception, which the menu describes in some pretentious all natural way, despite the fact that it's literally just a pepperoni pizza. It was good, but nothing special. My boyfriend got the When Pigs Fly, which you'd have to eat with two hands or with a fork, because the meat on top wasn't even cut. Maybe I just don't get the appeal, but $15 for what is essentially a flatbread with 4 pieces of prosciutto and some micro greens thrown on top? \\n\\nThey offer several alcoholic beverages, and espresso based drinks. However, after noticing their \\"craft espressos\\" were being made from pods in a Nespresso machine, I opted for lemonade. \\n\\nOverall, The Local Pizzaiolo's service is poor and the pizza is something I'd expect from a restaurant that casually added pizza to their menu on the side, not from one with pizza in the name.

We didn't bother looking up Yelp reviews before, since we assumed they were all good, and decided to see what others had to say after we didn't enjoy our food here. We were surprised to see many glowing reviews, but maybe we had a different experience since we ate here at lunch time. Having only eaten in the North End for dinner when it is packed, it was a change of pace to be one of only a few patrons dining here. The staff was very friendly and nice, and the bread and olive oil they brought out first was decent. We ordered bruschetta for an appetizer, and while it was ok, we were not very impressed. For our entrees, I was shocked at the amazing deal they offered of a sampler of 5 different dishes for only $7.95. I ordered that and my husband went with the chicken parmigiana. I was appalled when they brought my food out. It was just a huge pile of food on my plate. Part of me was thinking how awesome it was that I got all this food, but the presentation was really lacking. I could barely tell what was what as all the food was just mashed together. It was also quite oily and bland. I tried some of everything (at least I think I did. It was hard to tell where one food ended and the next began), but there was way too much for me to even think about finishing and I was not tempted to, as I usually am at Italian restaurants even when the portions are huge. I think that the foods offered must have been the leftovers re-heated from the night before. My husband did not enjoy his plate either, saying the tomato sauce tasted like watered down ketchup, and the whole thing was bland as well. We let them box up our food since we didn't want to be rude, but we ended up throwing it away in the first trash can we found. To give some perspective, we are a couple who loves eating at Olive Garden and always takes home whatever leftovers we can. We kept thinking the rest of the day how disappointed we were in the food.

I love the location in downtown Tucker, right beside the railroad tracks. And the interior has a very trendy feel with brick walls and concrete floors. But the food and service were the downside to our dinner at this new establishment.\\n\\nFirst, our server was very sweet although perhaps too quiet . . . and aloof. We saw her very rarely during the meal, resulting in drinks that badly needed refills. And it took 45 minutes for the food to arrive after we placed our orders. Yes, despite the restaurant being nearly empty on a Tuesday night, it took at least 45 minutes to receive our order. The menu warned that customers should expect to wait the appropriate time for burgers, but unless the cow was freshly slaughtered behind the restaurant, this seemed excessive.\\n\\nAnd when the food did arrive, I think only my husband truly enjoyed his meal, which was the Little John burger (two pieces of bacon, white cheddar cheese and a fried egg). I did not enjoy my chicken salad sandwich (roasted chicken, diced celery, grapes, pecans, red onion, pickles, mayo and a dash of mustard). Any time I bite into a huge chunk of fat on chicken, it's pretty much game over. And the ciabatta bread it was served on had not been toasted, so that was disappointing. To top it off, the tots on the side were barely toasted. After 45 minutes, you'd think the tots would have at least been well cooked. Finally, my grandmother was not pleased with her Rueben sandwich (thin sliced corned beef piled high with sauerkraut and Russian dressing) because it barely contained any saurkraut and the amount of meat made it impossible to consume without taking the sandwich apart.\\n\\nGive me Napoleon's in Decatur any day.

The service was friendly and prompt, but my first thought when I walked in was that it might have the oddest decor of any restaurant I've been into in a while.  It's all sushi-lounge classy, and then one wall is lined with these amateur paintings with no evident theme. It's not like it was damaging to the experience of the evening, it was just... strange.  The restaurant was empty when we arrived, but by the time we left nearly every table was occupied.\\n\\nAnyway, the oddness continued when I opened the menu - when they say \\"sushi and tapas\\" they REALLY mean \\"sushi (full stop. And: ) tapas.\\"  As in: there is an entire sushi section filled with interesting rolls, and then there is a section for tapas - and the tapas are not \\"asian fusion\\" or in any way related to the sushi menu.  There were duck dishes, bruschetta; a whole gamut of tapas.  The variety was cool, just not what I was expecting.\\n\\nMy partner and I ordered from both menus; we got two nice (if slightly small) sushi rolls.  Both were quite good and the quality of the fish was great.  We also ordered a couple of tapas (the pistachio shrimp, and a beef dish).

When I went, a bunch of old men were sitting at the counter, reading the newspaper, sipping coffee, and chatting with the old lady waitresses. The waitresses themselves contributed to the atmosphere - their outfits were a nice 50's pale pink color, and they looked like they could've been from then.\\n\\nThe donuts themselves are simply okay.

Shin Jung Korean Restaurant!\\n\\nAnd the rest of the family would have to agree with him.  We can't wait to go back and this place will be the first dinner out when we get to Orlando.  Foodies that we are, we're already talking longingly for the meal we had there in late August.\\n\\nA good 20-minute drive from our rented house, this place is WELL worth the trip.  Forget about the busy, trafficked road, park in the back, ignore the exterior, and enter into a warm, noisy place filled with happy people eating and drinking, cooking on the grills, and relaxing.  This is NOT an intimate place to take a first date, but if you lived near here, you'd be packed in with the happy crowd frequently feasting with friends on delicious Korean food.\\n\\nService is straightforward, not fancy, a little bossy, but fun.  Lighten up other people: the server is a cross between your mom and a take-charge aunt.  She started us off with some food on the grill, showed us how, then let us take it from there, occasionally checking and helping to make sure we were turning the meat correctly.  She was especially nice to our youngest son, and showed him a lot of attention and kindness.\\n\\nOkay, so what about the food?  FANTASTIC.  Pan fried dumplings arrived sizzling hot and the crispy outsides contrasted beautifully with the juicy insides, made even better when drizzled with the dipping sauce.  We ordered an array of grilled meats:  kalbi (short ribs), bulgogi, and chicken, each marinated in a sauce which carmelizes beautifully when cooked on the grill in the center of the table.  Son #1 had a noodle dish with beef that was also very good.  Bounteous side dishes are served around the grilled meats.  Don't be shy - ask what everything is and try things you might never have had before.  Your tastebuds will thank you.

We had two hungry kids with us and it took a very long time for the food to come out and when it did it wasn't even that hot. I got the chicken burger with onion rings. The burger was very good, but, the onion rings were a greasy mess with the skins completely separated from the onions. My husband got the meatloaf which was dry, and the mashed potatoes that did not have gravy (they ran out and the waitress did not offer an alternative before placing the order). We asked for grilled chicken fingers for one child and they brought out one burnt little piece of chicken and four greasy fried pieces. We asked about this and the waitress said that she got yelled at for taking this order and that they couldn't do grilled pieces (even though my chicken burger was grilled and the same amount as the strips) . We asked for mac n cheese instead, which was bland and my child (nor any of us) did not like either. The french fries were small and weak as well. We spent $55 for four and my kids were still hungry when we left. It took almost two hours for us to get in and out. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we were not impressed and will not be back unless improvements are made. The waitress should have told us about the gravy and about the chicken tenders so that we could have made alternative choices. It took so long for us to get the food that I wasn't willing to order anything else at that point and we had to feed our kids again when we got home. The beers were good, but, expensive. No beer prices were listed so we had no idea of price until we got the bill.

Something went wrong at the time with my brain. Ear. Or both.  Picture of ham came up in my mind.  I replied sure.   Now I gaming.

Then that's when the phone conversation recall.  ANCHOVIES...... holy cow.   (For anyone never tasted it before. It's a salty fishy flavor).  I kind of hate how that saltness keep attacking my tastes buds but at the same time it make you wanted to take another bite.   It's a great experience.    Would I ever get it with my pizza again.  Probably not. But I don't regret it.  Love and hate.   \\nI totally need to go back to this place for the pizza again.   The garlic knot seem OK.  Little plain for me.

The ascetic is so beautiful and peaceful! This is such a great addition to Coolidge Corner. The pastries and sweets are so cute!\\nAlright, so my first time in I was pretty excited about this place. It wasn't busy, plenty of seats and everything looked appealing. I had the tempura rice bowl and rooibos tea which all tasted fine to me. Probably would have given this place 4/5 if I had written a review at that time. \\n\\nThe second time in I was super excited to show this place to my dad. We came in for a late lunch on a Tuesday afternoon, and man this place was packed. We had to walk around looking for a spot for quite awhile and eventually settled to sitting at the bar area. Despite the place being packed there was only one person in line. We stood behind this person (who was just ordering a drink) for literally FIVE minutes while THREE different people helped her. WHAT?! How hard is it to order tea? \\n\\nBoth my dad and I had bento boxes (one salmon and one veg tempura) and tea. The total was about $45. We sat down and waited for our food (which was pretty quick!) and were both pretty disappointed when the spread arrived. Not only are the portions small (which is fine with me if the food is good), but their bento boxes are so BORING. There is a pathetic assortment of picked vegetables and raw carrots that looks like a child put it together. You have your rice and whatever main you ordered, miso soup, and that's it. There is no flair at all. You could literally make this at home. That would be okay, but for $45 I would rather get something slightly more interesting at a proper restaurant with table service and tablecloths. Not cramped at a bar because there weren't any tables with screaming kids all over the place. It's just not worth the money. \\n\\nNow that the rose tinted glasses were off, I also noticed that the decor in there makes you feel like you are in some kind of kids cafe. It just doesn't feel as sophisticated as I would hope from a Japanese tea house. \\n\\nOkay, on to my third visit. This time I just ordered the white spicy peach tea and some kind of pastry (don't remember what it is called). The pastry was bland and nothing I would bother eating again. All of this was about $8. Again, just not worth the money. Regular tea (not some kind of latte) just shouldn't cost $5. It doesn't make sense. I know good tea (perks of being English) and maybe I'm missing something, but this isn't some kind of super high quality tea you get from a specialty tea shop. I also noticed that randomly throughout my time there the music would suddenly change and get very loud (almost to get people to leave?) and then quiet down a few minutes later. Strange. \\n\\nI don't think this place can last. It's a great place to sit and study or meet up with a friend, but I think people are going to catch on that the food is overpriced and just go there for the space. It's so packed in there but really it's just the same people who have been there for hours nursing the same cup of hot water."},{"name":"Crazy Dough's Pizza","address":"The Garage, 36 JFK St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Day 5 of Boston trip\\nThe shortest review ever:\\n\\nCrap."},{"name":"The Red Wagon","address":"2128 East Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've been here about 4 times, and the quality of the food prep is average to less-than.

At the moment, that sandwich just isn't worth $9.  They home make their hummus, but just because you make it from scratch, doesn't mean you should.

There were 8 of us eating there, so we all got different appetizers, main courses, and desserts so we could try some of everything.  It was all. So. Incredible.  Once the food was out, the conversation consisted of how delicious the food was, coupled with the occasional primal grunt when someone didn't want to stop eating to comment on how good the food was.  My dad, who never says much more than, \\"It was okay!\\" when asked about a dining experience, raved about it for at least 10 minutes after we left, saying it was one of the best places he's eaten in the world.

Food, and I LOVE soul food so I had to try it!  After a long day doing the tourist thing and skipping lunch, we were so happy to have made it here around 5pm.  I thought that since it wasn't quite dinner yet, there wouldn't be as much people.  However when we arrived, there were so many people waiting inside and outside.  We were told that the wait was 1.5 hours with it possibly being less than that.  At first we took some menus and sat down so we can order to-go and wait 20 minutes, but then after absorbing in the atmosphere we felt that we should just wait to get a table and experience the restaurant that was totally unique to Atlanta.  The wait ended up being only 45 minutes because I assumed that the 1.5 hour wait discouraged a lot of people who ended up leaving.  The 45 minutes was definitely worth the wait!  I had the midnight train, and it was PERFECTION!  The chicken was seasoned and fried just right.  It was very juicy and tender.  The waffle was like no other that I've had before!  Very delicious!  I also ordered a side of rice with gravy, which was good too but felt like for the sized portion it was very very overpriced.  My 20 month old son had the chicken tenders and fries and he ate a most of the tenders!  It's rare to find him eating a whole lot of something.  My boyfriend Tony ordered the chicken too and thought it was delicious.  At the end we ordered the sweet potato cheesecake to share, and normally we end up finishing up a delicious dessert, but this ended up being too sweet for all three of us!  I recommend getting the Midnight Train and Sweet Tea and that should suffice :)"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Order the duck fries and charcuterie board.

I went there last week with 2 friends. We all work nearby, so we're familiar with the place, though we don't go there too often.\\n\\nService started out being atrocious. Our stocky little server was brusque, unfriendly, and inattentive -- and we went there early, when the restaurant was maybe one-sixth full. I got up to refill my own water after awhile. Then we got a different server (shift change?) in the middle of things. She was MUCH better (and we told her so).\\n\\nWe started with the Turkish Meze Plate. My friends said they'd ordered this there before and loved it. Everything on the Meze Plate was tasty, especially the eggplant salad (and I usually dislike eggplant).\\n\\nI had a bit of the Chopped Romaine Salad, too (i.e., what one of my friends didn't eat). The dressing was really tasty.\\n\\nWe split the Sari's Lamb appetizer, which was super good. The lamb was flavorful, well-spiced, and not gamey at all.\\n\\nWe also split the Sliced Beef Brisket BBQ. I'm a BBQ fan (i.e., snob), and I was skeptical of getting this at Casablanca. But this brisket was really, really enjoyable! For a (nice) change, it was lean -- trimmed of gross fat (Sweet Cheeks, are you listening?). The marinade was tasty but not overpowering; the beef flavor really came through. I just wish there was a bit more meat (it was an okay portion -- not too skimpy -- but slightly on the light side). The baked beans were tasty too, though again, there weren't enough of them. The sweet & sour cabbage was fantastic -- I could've eaten a pint of it!\\n\\nLastly, for dessert, I had the Flourless Chocolate Cake. It was really moist, rich, and good -- though again, a bit small for the price. During winter, I might skip dessert and walk a block to Burdick's, to get overpriced ($5.75) hot milk chocolate.\\n\\nI'd definitely keep going back to Casablanca, though I wouldn't want to sit in our original server's section again!

Melon bread and shoku pan is readily sold in Uwajimaya so I didn't find it to be a specialty item. Price was bit high for lack of texture and flavor I'm used to in Japan. Perhaps the level of expertise that is needed is hard to find in bakers in USA or too time consuming for the quantity sold. Decoration was not very intricate. Whatever the reason, I couldn't help but feel little disappointed despite trying five different kinds. It was either too sweet or texture was too dry.

Bold, robust flavors that you expect out of good charcuterie. It's nice to be told what everything is I'm eating (which I wasn't), but that's just a minor personal preference. I do think it speaks to the level of service here, though. The smoked salmon was especially good. \\n\\nThe Crispy Brussel Sprout Leaves with Golden Raisins and Pecorino were also delicious. I don't normally like brussel sprouts, but would highly recommend these to anyone. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the rest was pretty unremarkable. I'm not sure how you call yourself the Salty Sow and fail to put salt on anything. On the table? Table salt. I couldn't even fix it myself. How about a bowl of some sort of gourmet salt? At the very least: Kosher. Cauliflower and Wild Rice Casserole: a flavorless mess.  The Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries were passable, but unmemorable. Their version of bearnaise sauce is questionable. The Crisp Chicken Thighs were cold and rubbery. Not good or crispy at all.

Seriously lacking in salt/acid. \\n\\nAs for the service, I'm shocked. I'm a pretty easy going guy, but I shouldn't have to ask for water twice. From two different servers. I realize it was probably our server's first night, but when a pregnant woman in the company of drinkers asks you for a non-alcoholic beer, go to the bar and see if you actually carry one before telling her you don't (turns out they did upon further investigation BY ME). Same goes for the Campari I asked for. If you really don't have it (!), suggest an alternative. Petty? Perhaps. After one experience, I would let bad service go. But twice? I probably won't be back.\\n\\nI will say, they've done a remarkable job of taking the mess of a place Red House Pizzeria left and turning it into a beautiful restaurant. Honestly, I wasn't sure it could be done. \\n\\nOverall, with a few minor adjustments, more attention to detail, and some goddamn salt, this place could be amazing.

I don't know if there is a mixologist on staff, but I feel this place could really launch its self above a lot of the nearby restaurants if the mixed drink list was unique, complex and just a touch more innovative. When my husband ordered an Old Fashioned (which is not on the drink menu), it came to our table in a short martini glass, and tasted slightly watered down by the added orange juice/pulp. The alcohol also sank to the bottom... maybe a regular short glass next time with contreau instead of regular OJ? Honestly we had never had a Old Fashioned prepared this way before and would be more specific next time. Also, there was a lot of fruit on the edge of drinks that we could have done without.\\n\\nLastly, dessert. There was only one dessert option here and I must admit, I was pretty disappointed.

These people would find the experience a lot more enjoyable if they would come in with an open mind, take the food as it comes (without substitutions, changes, modifications), and not try to make Tanuki something it isnt.\\n\\nThe statement that your wife/friend/ex-boss/hamsters sister is Japanese or lived in Japan \\"so they would know\\" is like saying I am an American so \\"I would know\\" the exact preparation and authenticity of every single regional style in the US. Yeah, its pretty ridiculous. A side fact: Tanuki could call their food \\"Memphis-style Kosher/Mexi Fusion\\" and it wouldnt matter because it would still be EXCELLENT FOOD.\\n\\nMy advice? Dont listen to anyone here (including me), try Tanuki for yourself.

I'm going to fix it now!!!\\"\\n\\nIt is obvious that the food is prepared by young chefs.\\n1. Bandanas. Bandanas everywhere! Young chefs like to wear bandanas and upgrade to a toque or no hat once they've reached maturity.\\n2. The menu items sound good... in theory. What is a good menu without proper execution? A complete waste. Duck fat fries with a 110 minute egg and bearnaise? Sounds bad ass! Except we received small, saltless broken ends of french fries (obviously frozen fries), with an unseasoned egg, and unseasoned bearnaise. The avocado stuffed with pulled pork would have been delicious had they salted the avocado. No one likes an unseasoned avocado! Learning how to season is Cooking 101, and also a common rookie mistake made by young chefs.\\n\\nThe candied pork belly, on the other hand, was almost brackish. Some parts of the pork belly were spot on perfect, while others had me raiding the table for a sip of soda to rinse the salt out. Is this why they're called the Salty Sow? The slow cooked beef shoulder (AKA average pot roast) was no better than any other pot roast, with the potatoes and veggies being just as such.\\n\\nDon't let all the 4 and 5 star reviews fool you.

Well, how about driving 2 minutes down the street, parking in a sand lot, and walking right up to the nicest BBQ Truck lady ever and ordering cheap BBQ and taking it back home in under 10 minutes?\\n\\nThat's basically what we did this past Friday night. Once again we were in a very indecisive mood, neither of us able to make a decision on where we want to go eat. Finally, the wife reminded me that M&M Ribs are open late on Friday. So after looking on the interweb to figure out exactly where it's located, and seeing that's it's a stone's throw from our condo, we were out the door faster than you can say \\"food truck festival\\".\\n\\nWe arrive and there's a family eating on some picnic tables to the left of the food truck. The menu is listed right underneath the window of the truck, along with some specials listed right at window level.\\n\\nAfter some tough decisions, Abby went with the ribs dinner with mac and cheese and spicy beans and rice and I went with the ribs/chicken combo dinner with spicy beans and rice and candied yams. I also added an order of fried chicken wings. Once of the nicest ladies ever, who was all smiles, took our order and just seemed genuinely happy to be sharing the food with us. After a short wait, we paid and got our food. (\\"You'll be coming back soon, dear.\\" How right she will be...)\\n\\nWe got home and unpacked the goodies from the bag. The chicken wings were the kind of wings you'd expect from a family cook out. Perfectly fried, a little greasy, with a great crispy, flavorful crust. The candied yams were sweet and succulent. The spicy beans and rice didn't look like what I was expecting, but were also delicious and with a nice little kick. The BBQ chicken looked dry, but wasn't at all. There was a little white meat and some dark meat all mixed together. The famous ribs had some bites that were more tender than others, but were fantastic. The BBQ sauce wasn't the best I've ever had, but did what it had to do without over powering the meat, which is key.\\n\\nM&M Ribs is not the best BBQ I've ever had. However, it is by far the best value (very large portions over very good food) I've ever had in the Boston area. Both times I've eaten from this food truck (at the food festival and again this night) I've been left wanting more, in a good way.

Bummer.\\n\\nFour - count them, four- wines in each color by the glass.  Stick to the fancy drinks, they seem to be popular.  \\n\\nThere are now many restaurants in Austin serving food worthy of your well-earned money and time; patronize those.

It wasn't bad.  I had the corn chowder to start, followed by the fillet au poivre with onion straws.  The soup was good, and the meat was delicious.  However, for the price, I wasn't blown away by the service.  It took an eternity between the first course and the entree, and then another long span between desert and them seeing if we wanted coffee.  \\n\\nSo the place was hip, and certainly it was good eats for Newton.  But I would have rather gone across the street for Acquitaine.  I guess there's something about a steakhouse, that brings to mind a different level of service than a normal restaurant.

Marshall's is a bit of a strange place, as when you first walk in you're given more the impression of a semi-trendy restaurant / nightclub than that of a place the serves biscuits and gravy. It almost looks like two different restaurants are missing their adjoining wall. Apparently Marshall's does serve standard bar food and drinks during the evening hours and has been bestowed with such accolades as \\"Best Single's Scene\\" and \\"Best Martini.\\" By whom, I'm not exactly sure, as their website doesn't really go into details on that. I can't speak to that directly, as I opted for coffee over a martini, and the \\"single's scene\\" has never really been my niche.\\n\\nAs to the breakfast, I think the three of us agreed that it was definitely in the top tier of places we've visited so far. Jay and I showed up a bit before Cameron and were immediately seated, which is rare for a Saturday morning. While the coffee wasn't the best I've had, I'm admittedly a bit of a coffee snob. Adding a little cream and sugar brought it right up to par with most breakfast places' offerings. I'll give you fair warning, however: there is a reason that there is no breakfast plate on the menu that has both pancakes and hash browns. Jay and I both made the mistake of ordering the #3 plate (two eggs, two pancakes, and side of meat) plus a side of home fries. Someone should have warned us that the pancakes were approximately a foot in diameter. Needless to say, we were more wasteful than we usually are that morning.\\n\\nOn that note, Jay made a very good point in discussing our proposed reviewing system, and that is the need to classify the different styles of hash browns. Or \\"home fries\\" as the southern folks may call them. Just about every breakfast restaurant serves something called \\"home fries\\" or \\"hash browns,\\" but what you end up getting can vary widely. Marshall's version of \\"home fries\\" are basically the fried potato cube variety as opposed to the shredded potato kind. And they're plentiful, just like the pancakes.\\n\\nAt the end of the breakfast, everyone was full and the restaurant was starting to fill up. Apparently with marathon runners? Marshall's certainly wasn't the greasiest restaurant we've been to yet, but I was a bit surprised to see that many apparently-health-conscious people there. Maybe there are some options on the menu that are more healthy than the \\"giant stack of pancakes\\" platter i opted for.\\n\\nBut I, for one, will never know.\\n\\n--\\nOriginally written for andy.teamsoell.com (http://andy.teamsoell.com/home/34-blog/85-third-best-pancakes-in-town.html)"},{"name":"Pepe's Cantina","address":"120 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Good food!

I don't know what it is about this young hip crowd that just doesn't seem to care about overpriced food or terrible service, like they would eat anything and pay anything as long as its 'hip' to do it there.\\n\\nI had a $15 burger that was not only cooked wrong, but also wasn't worth nearly that much money. I finally got my drink that I ordered with my appetizer halfway through my meal, so I was stuck drinking the last few drops of warm water they leave on your table. Yeah, no ice, no getting the bottles refilled(good luck finding your waiter), just what was left of that warm water. Did I mention that its all outside seating? In Texas? I was told that the warm water thing was 'very European'. Ok? Is it 103 anywhere in Europe right now? This is Texas. Give me some freaking ice, please.\\n\\nThe wait staff was downright pathetic. And I think what chapped my A the most was the fact that he took out 20% grat. I couldn't believe it. I ALWAYS tip 25%+. Always. I was only going to tip him 10%, which was still more than he earned. But why work for your money when youre guaranteed 20%? I have to work for my money, and I don't get to slack. I can't believe I had to give him my money I work so hard for so he could come around every 25 minutes.

A quick Yelp search revealed that Wasabi Grill was located in the same building as House of Hookah, so we agreed that we'd give them a try.\\n\\nWhen my friend and I initially walked in around 7 pm, there were only two tables of customers.  Our server told us we could choose where we wanted to sit and handed us the menus.\\n\\nI really like Japanese food, but I always have trouble choosing what I want at Japanese restaurants.  Fortunately, since we were early for dinner, my friend and I had about half an hour to decide what we wanted to order while we waited for our other friend to arrive.\\n\\nAfter a long week of work, we wanted to unwind with some alcohol, but we didn't see any in their menu.  Then, I recalled having read a review mentioning \\"BYOB\\" at Wasabi Grill.  Sure enough, our server confirmed that they don't serve alcohol, but we could bring our own.  We immediately called our friend (who was stuck in traffic!) and asked if he could pick some up on the way.  Thankfully, he was happy to do so.  =)\\n\\nBefore our friend arrived with the booze, we decided to order an appetizer - the Dynamite Shrimp.  It didn't take much time for it to be prepped and served.\\n\\n* Dynamite Shrimp ($6.50) - Per the menu description, this consists of \\"Tempura shrimps, chopped and covered with sauce.\\"  Maybe we should have read the description more closely, but we had expected whole shrimps.  Although the sauce was sweet, slightly spicy, and tasty, the chopped bits of shrimp and portion were small.  I probably wouldn't order this again because I didn't think it was worth the price.\\n\\nSoon after my friend arrived with drinks (yay!), we ordered our meals.  I ordered a \\"House Roll\\" - the Tuna Avalanche.\\n\\n* Tuna Avalanche ($12) - This was supposed to be a \\"Generous portion of spicy chopped tuna, poured over shrimp tempura roll.\\"  Yes, the chopped tuna was spicy.  In fact, it was EXTREMELY spicy as it contained bits of minced jalapenos.  It practically gave me heartburn.  However, I didn't think that it was a \\"generous portion\\" per the description.  The shrimp tempura roll was very small, and each piece was practically falling apart when I dipped it into my soy sauce/wasabi mixture.  Basically, the rice was too soft, so the roll didn't stay in shape.  Taste-wise, it was fairly good, but the spiciness from the jalapenos was overwhelming.\\n\\nOne of my friends ordered the Wasabi Roll ($10) - \\"Tuna, salmon, white tuna, avocado, masago and mayo, rolled and covered with wasabi tobiko.\\"  The roll was cut into five huge pieces, which were difficult to eat.  My friend also thought the rice in her roll was too soft and there was way too much mayo in it.  Not good.\\n\\nOverall, Wasabi Grill gets 3.5 stars for their decently-priced, \\"OK\\"-tasting rolls and BYOB.  However, I had to subtract 1/2 a star for their mediocre service and 1 star since they do not serve alcohol at all.  Additionally, each person who drinks alcohol brought into the restaurant gets charged a $1 BYOB fee.  I may return if I'm going to House of Hookah and choose to dine at Wasabi Grill for the \\"convenience,\\" but it isn't a restaurant I would go out of my way for.\\n\\n[Review 269 of 366]"},{"name":"Mamma Maria","address":"3 North Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Definitely great for a special night.

We ordered and I saw on the menu that they had gluten free bread. I decided to order some and the waiter explained it was only available as an appetizer, so I decided to order it. It really isn't bread per se, but a pizza crust made with a garlic bread type topping. It was a little dry, so we asked for some sauce. That wasn't a problem and he brought some, which made the \\"garlic bread\\" much better. I had the Chicken Marianna and it was pretty good. I ordered it with the gluten free gemelli pasta. I ordered the gemelli to try something new and it is a very heavy dense pasta. If I had to do it over, I'd stick with something a little less dense. That's not their fault, but mine. Everyone else enjoyed their meal. One thing that is also worth noting is all their entrees are huge and everyone ended up with enough left over to take home.

So I figured not to give him so much crap after forgetting to put one of the appetizers in or filling up our drinks every time they were empty ( My food was good, My cousins was bad & she barely picked at it but she didn't complain, My mother wanted her salad before her entree, but she didn't complain ).

I walked in to what looks like a professional operation.  Mrs Jones was nice enough and food was served quickly.  The one red flag should have been, \\"would you like a little or a lot of sauce\\"  I found that to be a little odd but brushed it off.  Well I should have paid attention to my intuition.  The ribs with \\"a little sauce\\" were drenched.  This might not have been bad except that the sauce was awful.  A weird mix of vinegar and sugar flavors.  The ribs (st louis style) were very fatty.  They were moderately tender but far too fatty.  Certain sections were actually very tough.  Nothing I've experienced before.  \\n\\nAs far as the sides, my wife got the mashed potatoes and I got the mac & cheese.  Mash potatoes looked like something out of a box.  According to the wife, they tasted like it too.  My mac & cheese, while creamy, was a travesty.  The mac was soggy.  Not slightly overcooked, soggy.  The cheese was cheap, like Kraft American singles cheap.  The cole slaw was actually the best part.  A solid 8 on that.  Way to go!

On a side note - it appears John Mueller opened a new 'cue joint and butcher.\\n\\nThis was the best BBQ we had on the journey - and not much of a line when we went, either.  We ordered a few hot links, pork ribs, and brisket (the point, by request!).  After our tasty Lone Star Beer, we got our food and sat down at the picnic tables. \\n\\nThe brisket absolutely melted in your mouth, and was simply seasoned with salt and black pepper, and I would guess a few other spices (coffee?) playing in the background.  Because of this, the bar has been raised on my own brisket - and I am still working to get to this level.\\n\\nThe ribs were also incredible.  Simple seasoning (again), but with an excellent pull and tenderness.  The hot links were really good as well, with a nice spice and a good pop of the casing when bit.\\n\\nOverall, amazing place with lines a lot shorter than Franklin's, and by most accounts on par with the best of the best.

There were still some bar stools available but not for long. They have a decent selection of 8 draft beers which cost $3.50 during HH. Fairly extensive HH food menu with all the usual suspects (spinach dip, burgers, fries) but also more variety with several salads and a portabello mushroom dish. I ordered the curry calamari which was served over a cabbage slaw with a creamy mango dipping sauce ($4.50). It was a welcome variation on the Italian version. The portion was large enough to fill me up completely. My boyfriend had the portabello mushroom which was served with some salad greens ($4.50). My only disappointment with this dish is that it had been cooked in something akin to a steak sauce which made it taste extremely salty and ruined any healthy eating attempts. I recommend you ask for the sauce on the side or just to eliminate the sauce altogether.\\nThe vibe at the bar was good. Music was just loud enough to hear but not overwhelm our conversation.

I had the lemon sole for my meal which was a generous portion of two filet and lots of veggies.  I also got to try a bite of the chorizo mac and cheese which was rich and delicious, but didn't really fit the menu, and the cheese cake (I think it was cheesecake) dessert, of which I wish I had had room for the entire thing!\\nAhh...

To start the bread they serve you with the olive oil mixed with some grated parmesan is seriously addictive. I could have made an entire meal out of that alone, along with their stellar wine list! You wouldn't expect a quaint place like this in the north end to have the caliber of wine list that they do and I loved it! I tried to order the one Bonarda they had but the woman came back and said that they were out of it and weren't planning on getting any more. What's helpful to those that swear by ratings is they have the ratings on all the bottles listed on the menu, from RP, WS, WA and maybe even JS. I decided on a Super Tuscan, the 2009 Sondraia Bolgheria Superiore. It was FANTASTIC! It was served properly by the lovely waitress, proper temperature, decanted and all. I can't believe how low their markups are. I immediately ordered a case from my wine guy at $45 a bottle and this restaurant only charged us $53!!!! On to the food. We started with the caprese salad and the tomatoes could have been a bit more flavorful, always my issue with this dish. The waitress suggested we share a pasta dish as they are quite large and she wasn't kidding. We split the home made cavatelli with ground sausage and hot Italian peppers, uhm in 1 word, YUM! The two of us couldn't finish the plate and I only wish I could have taken the leftovers on the train with me. We did leave some room for desert and we chose the chocolate lava cake with vanilla gelato. I'm not a chocolate fan but this was pretty much heaven. The top reason I would want to live in Boston would be so I could visit this place every week for my Sunday dinner!"},{"name":"Spoon Eastside","address":"749 Moreland Ave SE, Ste C-105","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I really like what they did with the place after Salsa.

Luckily he didn't mind.\\n\\n4)  The plate that had his mac and cheese bowl and applesauce was dirty.   It had some red sauce caked on it.\\n\\n5)  The food came out poorly paced.  The waitress asked if we'd like our son's meal to come out with the appetizer.  That was nice of her to ask and we said yes.  But, his food came out before the appetizer and he was almost done with his meal by the time the appetizer came out.  He was completely done by the time our main courses came out.\\n\\n6)  My husband's wrap was supposed to contain BBQ sauce and cheese but it had neither making it inedibly dry.  He asked the waitress for a side of BBQ sauce and it never arrived.  She came back asking if we were ready for the check, but my husband was still waiting for his BBQ sauce!  The manager was kind enough to remove it from our bill, but our experience was already really soured.  \\n\\n7)  I ordered the mac and cheese with chicken and broccoli.

I was NEVER told that my card was charged the full amount and then voided when I ordered the pizza.

Prior to their recent renovation, I brought my son here with me to have lunch. We throughly enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere, however, as we were eating I witnessed one of the staff accidentally kick my boots (which had been removed in order to enter the tatami room) into the middle of the floor and just leave them there. A moment later another staff member walked by and actually stepped on my boots and, again, just left them there in the middle of the floor. This was annoying, but I kind of just let it go. After all, I had enjoyed coming here multiple occasions prior to this. \\n\\nNow on my most recent trip here, which was post renovation/reopening, apparently they have a new system for ordering/seating arrangements. When we arrived there was no one at the hostess podium so no one informed us that we had the option of being seated and ordering from a menu. So we ordered at the counter like I had done so here many times, only when our transaction was complete the person on the register said we should sit either at the front or... well, actually he kind of mumbled the last part so to make sure I understood I attempted to confirm, \\"either the front or the tatami room, yes?\\", which he then confirmed. We took our shoes off and sat in the tatami room. \\n\\nA few minutes later the hostess popped her head in and asked if we were eating lunch, or if we had ordered at the counter, which was a rather confusing thing to ask given that we were doing both. Later I came to find out that she meant to ask if we had been seated there and were ordering from the menu... at least that's what I think she meant, I don't know because she was rather unclear. So she then tells us \\"well, I guess I don't mind if you sit here, but when it gets busy I might ask you to move\\". We were shocked. \\nIt wasn't so much the content of the message than the look on her face when she said it, her general condescending unprofessional demeanor, and her choice of wording. Regardless, we gathered our drinks, and belongings, put on our shoes and and began placing our things at another table towards the front at which time we were told \\"not this table\\". Again... seriously? \\n\\nDon't be vague and hope the customer understands what you mean and then continuously inconvenience and embarrass them. \\n\\nPlease teach the staff some professional courtesy and be specific about the seating and ordering options."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"1675 28th St","city":"Boulder","stars":"2.5","text":"Came in about 12:00 am.

We had high expectations and were excited that there was a new place for dinner and drinks in Coolidge Corner.  Unfortunately, unless some things change I'm not sure that we will be back.  \\n\\nPros:  Location.  Decent bar.  Friendly owner.  \\n\\nCons:  \\n\\nWaitstaff - we opted to sit at the bar and were mildly concerned when nobody acknowledge our existence for over 5 minutes (this was a Sunday night and the place was not overly busy).  When the bartender finally noticed us the first unfriendly words out of her mouth were \\"are you all set?\\"  Um - no.  How about some menus?  We were handed 1 food menu and 1 drink menu.  I guess we were expected to share it?  We had to ask for a second menu.  Luckily another bartender took over from this person a little while later.  This second person was friendlier; however, she leads to the next point....\\n\\nDrinks - my husband couldn't even finish his.  He had the H & S something-or-other.  It had bourbon in it, but you wouldn't be able to tell it from the overwhelming amount of some kind of cherry liquor that had been added to it.  The second bartender mentioned above had made this drink and when my husband told her it didn't taste good she kind of just made a face and said something along the lines of that they were working on the recipe.  I was happy I had opted for a beer.\\n\\nFood - I ordered the grilled cheese with bacon.  The bacon tasted good.  The cheese - I'm not sure what I was tasting there.  It had the consistency of hot cheeze whiz, but with some kind of spice.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't really taste good either.  Not to mention that it looked like it was on Wonder bread and cost I think $12 (which included $2 for the bacon I believe).  I don't know about everyone else, but when I see a grilled cheese offered as a sandwich on a menu I expect it to be, if nothing else, a large grilled cheese.  This was tiny.  So tiny it looked stupid on the plate.  It was served with cold gazpacho.  Meh - wouldn't be my first pick for a soup to accompany a grilled cheese.  My husband got the burger with pimento cheese and fried egg and bacon.  He said it was good, though he didn't think the fries were very good.   \\n\\nAmbiance - while not bad, the ambiance of the place just didn't seem right.  It always amazes me how many places get this point wrong.  This place took how long to open - a year?  That was a year to think about how the place should feel, and while it didn't completely strike out it also didn't hit it out of the ballpark.  Otto's around the corner, which is *just*  a pizza joint gets it more right than this place does.  To me, Hops N Scotch is in the right location to be more of an upscale bar/restaurant that caters to people other than college students - so why does it seemingly try to \\"blend in\\" with what is already being offered in Coolidge Corner when it should be trying to stand out?  \\n\\nTonight my husband and I were hoping to find something more along the lines of an Eastern Standard (Kenmore Square) which we think would do well in Coolidge Corner, but instead we found just another bar/restaurant serving average, overpriced  food with a sub-par waitstaff and poor quality mixed drinks.  I think it is time that more be demanded of the establishments around here.  We certainly pay enough to live here - make me feel like it's worth it.  Wow me.  Get rid of the waitstaff that is isn't performing well.  Improve the food.  Improve the quality of the drinks.
