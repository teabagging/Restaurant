Donuts with burgers seems to be the main thing but they also have chicken dishes and similar that you can get. About 2/3 of this place seems to be reserved for the restaurant and the rest for the people that want to sit at the bar. They had pretty loud music but it was good. They also have a few tables outside as well.\\n\\nWe wanted to save room for dessert so we skipped on the appetizers. I ordered the El Camino which is an angus beef burger with chipotle mayo, chipotle cheese blend, pretty much everything with chipotle and some jalape√±os served on a donut. It was a really amazing blend of flavors, it was not too spicy just a perfect blend of flavors. It comes with chips but you can replace it with other sides if you want.\\n\\nI ordered the sin-a-bomb donut for dessert, the description describes it perfectly: melted cinnamon butter & sugar poured over cream cheese icing. It was really good, lot's of sugar but the cinnamon flavor blended it together really well.\\n\\nThe service was good but a little slow, even though it was a Monday night they were quite busy. The biggest issue I had was their policy with kids. We came there just after 8 PM and didn't see a sign not at the door but to the SIDE of the door on the wall that children can't be there after 9 PM. It's not a federal law, not a state law and not even a city law but the owner's wish, which I can respect. No one told us until 15 mins before the general manager came and asked us if the server had told us. We were about done with the main meal and couldn't order the dessert and finish it there, our son had to be out within 15 mins. It was way too messy to eat the dessert in the car so we had to eat it when we got home and while it was good I'm sure it would have been better at the restaurant and this detracted from the overall experience.

Since both of them are always full of good ideas, they suggested going out to an upscale Indian restaurant near the UT campus.\\n\\nI had to admit, I was really excited because I love Indian food and my hometown of Chicago is one of the best places to sample it outside of the great country itself. However, I was a little apprehensive because I thought \\"I am in Texas, do you think they really know how to prepare Indian food here?\\" I was thinking about a related horror I read in the papers when I guy asked for Spaghetti in a small Midwestern town and received egg noodles and ketchup, and I wondered what my result would be.\\n\\nAll of my fears were laid to rest when we arrived in the early evening on Friday. (NOTE: Reservations work wonders and are highly recommended) The restaurant is in an older stone building on Guadalupe Street, a few blocks from a run-down college section of town. We parked up the street a little ways, and I saw two syringes on the sidewalk, but that is neither here nor there. When we arrived, I was surprised to see how modern and swish the bar and dining area were. We had drinks before dinner, I drained 2 G and T's while my Mom and stepdad (?) looked at me as if I was going to be drunk for dinner. Little do they know I can drink anyone under the table.\\n\\nBy now, I was getting a tad peckish, and the waitress arrived promptly, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that she was Indian (I was expecting to see a Texan in a cowboy hat, that's how much of a rube I was) and very friendly. She asked if we had ever been here before and began going down the list of what was good, etc. I saw that they had Tandoori Bites (Chicken cooked in a tandoor, subtly spiced and served with soft, warm naan) and we decided that this would be a great appetizer. My only complaint is that we did not get enough naan! I know that we were about to eat and it probably would have filled us up more, but I have to say that the naan I had there was probably the best I have had- EVER. It had a tasty, fluffy texture and I would have ordered just naan and Channa Masala if they had it on the menu...\\n\\nI ordered the Goat Curry, \\"Desi Hot\\". This is the \\"super hot\\" option they have for spices, as I love spicy food. However, I was not expecting how much kick it had, and the sweat began to form on my forehead as I was eating. My mom and her husband looked at me as if I was a major lightweight, which can't be too correct because they know I eat this stuff all the time. However, my mom's time in Texas has raised her capsaicin tolerance to obscenely high levels- sampling my dish, they didn't see what the big deal was. The meat was incredibly tender, served in a tomato sauce that was purely divine, I sensed Coriander, curry, Tamarind and something else I just couldn't put my finger on. I ended up taking some of it home as I was getting full, and did I mentioned it was spicy?\\n\\nMy mom had the Tandoori Chicken, and I believe her husband had the Vindaloo, a chicken-based specialty from Goa state. The scent of the garlic was really making me wished I had ordered both! I'd eat one, and take the leftovers home :)\\n\\nAs far as the setting is concerned, the seating is at small, circular \\"tapas\\" style table with raised stools, with a lot of modern art on the walls, framed by dark wood cross beams and thoughtfully-placed track lighting. The service was prompt and thoughtful, and the meal was a delight.

It's a half pound of hot dog that's been marinated in cider, grilled, placed on a grilled bun, then I get it topped with everything, onions, homemade chili, mustard, special sauce, relish, bbq sauce??? There's a list on the window but usually I'm just patiently staring at the line of people or those eating in their cars.  I tend to burn my tongue as well and get the sauces all over. Soooo GOOD! My family and I have been going there at least once a week since midsummer. \\n\\nI heard that it used to be a very difficult process to get one of these hot dogs, only summer, only during good sunny weather, and only tues-friday. However, I don't think Speed's actually serves the hot dogs anymore. They said they are going to be there year round and even on saturdays, usually 11am to 4/5pm or when they run out.

Apparently it is a great remake of his ever favourite and somewhat well known Wally Burger which is sadly no longer with us.\\nHe was not a large fan of the fries, since they were a thicker homestyle cut with unpeeled edges, and he prefers and thinner crispier fry, complaining they were really easy to undercook, but when I sampled them in their hashbrown form (sorry Heidi, you're not fooling anyone, I know that's your fries cut up into smaller pieces), they were super crispy and light, and had a soft moist inside.

They had a location back on up in his neck of the woods (he's very country) so I thought I'd wrangle my honey up and get on over for some sushi/burger fixins.  Heck, it was darn time we tried it out to see what the fuss was all about.  Yeee-haw!!!\\n\\nOk, moving past the redneck part of me, let's get serious.  Who would have thought of a burger joint and sushi place combined?  I love the concept, especially since I'm always in search of a good burger or quality sushi.  This location sits near the Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter Mall.  Free parking, if you can find a spot where you don't have to walk a quarter mile OR just valet.  Lots of great options on food in this little nook so we were excited to give it a go.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is awesome in this place.  From the bar with the aquarium in the background to the lighted booths, you can certainly feel relaxed.  We were seated at a large booth, and that's pretty much the extent of our enjoyment.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\nThe sushi was not fresh, and very cookie-cutter.  We ordered the \\"Motherload\\" to share, as it promised hope with a sampling of some of their favorite selections.  Nothing on the plate was good, besides the spicy tuna poke.  The filet roll wasn't what i thought, and didn't have much taste on the meat side.  Sashimi was ok and same as the nigiri ... both not so fresh.  It reminded me of many other EH times I've had with sushi.  My honey's wine she ordered was disgusting but she did order the cheaper white wine.\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\nThe spicy tuna poke appetizer was good, a little on the fresher side.  The wasabi had a major punch, and the spicy mayo was really good.  I did enjoy my Orpheus draft beer.\\n\\nOverall, highly disappointed.  I wish i had tried the burger now, but the overpriced sushi kind of did it for me.  My advice, don't trust a southern guy from North Carolina on his sushi preferences.

Secondly, we ordered from their website for delivery but they called us back saying that they only deliver within 5 miles - ok so we told them that according to google maps we only live 3.5 miles away. Then we hear someone in the background say \\"it's not safe\\" and the person on the phone just said \\"we don't deliver there so are you going to pick it up?\\" So I drive there and get my pizza and ask they couldn't deliver to my address, and that I heard someone say my apartment complex is \\"unsafe.\\" And this guy says there are apartments that they don't go to. And so I ask why and then he looks up my address and says \\"oh you live past John Young Pkwy? Yeah we don't go past OBT.\\" Wellll that information certainly wasn't on their website and probably because it is total BS. OBT is a mile from this place...why would they only deliver within a mile radius?

Next we ordered our food, I asked for a buffalo chicken personal pizza and my girlfriend asked for a chicken quesadilla. Place was pretty empty so I figured the food would come right out, after a descent wait, the waitress came over to inform us they were out of tortillas to make a quesadilla... so my girl ordered a cheese pizza to simplify things. Seconds later my food comes out, so now I either eat my food while she watches on or wait for her food to come out while mine gets cold. Let's move on to the food, the pizza was poor, and it's really had to screw up pizza in my eyes, they used grilled dough which I love but way too much red sauce for a buffalo pizza, the chicken didn't have any buffalo on it, more so it was chicken tender pizza with hot sauce drizzled over it and crumbles of blue cheese.

Just make sure to make reservations.  \\nSo...of course we got our messages crossed and the place I booked was not the one she wanted and the time I booked the reservation (9:30) was all wrong as well.  (She was hungry and couldn't wait to eat dinner so late).  What else could go wrong?   Hmmmmm I wonder at times why I get myself into these things.  The intent was honorable, but was my mind was elsewhere?\\n\\nThis did set up the initial mood for our dining experience which was unfortunate.

The atmosphere inside was unpretentious (hence the name of this place) and the service was very good and casual.\\n\\nShe, ordered some sparkling wine to go with her meal and I just had water.  Appy's were the tart's and the pate and she had a bowl of the French onion soup.  The tart was nice.  Puff pastry, cheese, fresh ingredients, simple, nice and light.  It came with a small tomato salad and greens on the side.\\nThe Pate, which we had to order it later, (the waiter thought it might be too much food, and if we were hungry for it, he would bring it out for us.)  Nice thought, but we were hungry and we ended up ordering it anyways.\\nI needed to do something while siting at the table and if not conversation, then food!  That kept things civil and our mouths busy with eating and talking about food.\\n\\nThe Pate de champagne was nice.  It didn't come with any crackers or bread and I guess we were supposed to use the sliced baguettes with the pate.  Some cornichons and mustard were nice side accompaniments for the pate.  I did feel that it was a little bit soft for my liking, but if you think about it, It's fresh and it was tasty.  Maybe missing a bit of zing?  A missing layer of something?  Couldn't place my finger on it but it was good.  We ate it all up!\\n\\nNow, for her soup.  It was indeed cheesy, but the broth was very light and didn't have much flavour.  This is why it didn't get the four stars.\\n\\nMain course?\\nShe had the Tenderloin beef which was very very nice.  Like in all good French food, it's about the sauces and the sauce that  was with this dish was smooth and rich and well layered in flavour and of course, yummy.  \\nI kept telling her to use the bread to sop up all that rich lovely sauce on her plate.  It also came with some veggies and \\"scalloped\\" potatoes.  Nice hint of what I thought was thyme and cheese and it was very very good.  4.5 stars for this dish!\\n\\nI had the lamb.

We had decided on eating at yak and yeti beforehand so I was able to look at the menu before we got there. Anyone who reads my reviews knows how much I like Asian fusion food so it was a relief that for once my gf and her friend were able to pick a place ahead of time for dinner. My GF is a landrys club member ( more on that later) so we were able to get priority seating within 10 minutes of checking in. The decor of the restaurant makes you feel like you are somewhere in Asia. It is one of my favorite restaurants to sit at and enjoy the ambiance. We were sat at a table upstairs and had drinks order with appetizers fairly quickly. Our waiter Justin was very knowledgeable as he described multiple items on the menu and even saw me looking at yelp pictures and was describing every picture to us. Gave excellent recommendations. He informed us that some items they sell at the outside quick sit restaurant which you can order at any time so it's worth it to try something different on the menu inside.\\n\\nWe ordered the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer and it tasted very good. It was a little smaller than other shrimp I have tried and they also seemed to be smaller. Our friends order the pot stickers which you can never go wrong with. As our entrees we ordered the Korean beef ( no peppers or onions) and she ordered the Kobe burger. The Korean beef was a wok entree and it tasted delicious. It might become my favorite go to meal whenever we are at the animal kingdom. The beef had a little bit of crunch and it went perfectly with the jasmine rice. The sauce was sweet and had just enough spice to keep me satisfied. I would HIGHLY recommend this entree if you visit the restaurant. The Kobe burger looked very appetizing as well, but it seemed to be on the rawer side ( my gf likes her meat well done). The center was a little pink. It was also very messy once you took a bite and she had a hard time keeping it together for some reason. The burger came with shoe string fries that were good as well. I did not try them but our friend ordered the ahi tuna nachos which they seemed very appetizing ( check out his review, his name is Jason Presto) \\n\\nOverall I highly recommend eating at Yak and Yeti whenever at animal kingdom. It's a few dollars more than a quick service and the food quality is way better. I also recommend the landrys card. It's a 25 dollar one time fee when you sign up for it. You automatically get a $25 dollar welcome reward and then get 25 dollar every year on your birthday and every $250 dollars you get another 25 dollar gift card. The card basically pays for it self once you go twice and use your welcome reward. It also gives you priority seating which means you show up with no reservation and are next to be seated. The manager also personally come to your table to greet you and thank you for being a landrys card member. They go above and beyond while you are at dinner. There's are about 4 restaurant you can use it at at he disney world resorts. As pass holders it was a no brainer for us with all the visitors we get throughout  the year."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It really is the best fried chicken!

It's a dish at the main restaurant as well, but last time our server convinced us not to try it - ha! Ordering was an ordeal as it is at all counter service places in Disney. You wait in insanely long lines while people take orders, answer questions and it's just a slow and painful process. Once your order is in, it's usually pretty quick coming out though! \\n\\nHoney Chicken was $10.69 and I imagine a small portion for most of us American folks. For me, it was a perfect size without eating the rice. Flavor wasn't amazing but it was decent, a bit too sweet, but I ate every last bite so it did me just fine. My friend had the Ginger Chicken Salad for $10.49 which is a pretty huge portion, looked fresh but it's all packed up and pre-made. It's a good healthy option while at the Disney parks though. Pop ran us $3.69 here.\\n\\nSeating in this area was not being cleaned enough and at peak times, it gets very tight without enough chairs for everyone. \\n\\nAll in all though, decent quick service option in Animal Kingdom.

And it reminded me of my visits to Barley.  \\n\\nSometimes you get a sophisticated/young Sean Connery driving his Aston Martin through the Alps (Goldfinger, 1964), like the currently available Wagyu flank steak, accompanied by the culinary equivalent of the Aston's \\"oil slick/machine guns\\" in the multiple sauces/foams that are more than just plate decoration (hint:  ask for a mini-spatula to get every drop).  \\n\\nSometimes you get a campy Roger Moore on a train in a bear suit (Octopussy, 1983), like the fatty duck liver/American cheese gel (yes... I said American cheese) that accompanies the current rabbit dish (don't ignore the house-made mustard that lifts the rabbit chorizo to another level).  \\n\\nOther times it's just a punch in the face of flavor bad-assery, (like Daniel Craig in [insert any of his films here]), like the buttery salmon, a board special the last time I dined at Barley, and a course I'll put up against any salmon in town, served with a fromage blanc and savory funnel cake.\\n\\nYep, I said it:  Bryce Gilmore is the Daniel Craig of fresh and innovative, responsibly-sourced sharable plates.\\n\\nDon't visit when you want to make your 7:00 showtime after dinner.  You'll want to take your time (even if you have a reservation, like they now offer 6-6:30pm, or 8:30-9pm Mon-Thu).  As a matter of fact, save your \\"Broadway show\\" ticket money, order 3 savory and 1 sweet dish per person, and just enjoy the performance put on nightly at Barley Swine.

It's one of the most stressful places I've ever been, not to mention stressful eating places. \\n\\nThe staff seems extremely rude to me. Considering how nice the hospital staff is to everyone, this place is 100% opposite. I believe the first 4 times eating here I had no idea how to order, where to order or how to order. Staff was less than helpful and I was tired of dirty looks within the first 2 minutes of being in this place.  Breakfast has been the worst to overcome in the ordering \\"process\\"). They don't really advertise when breakfast ends so I've been caught in the twilight zone of 955am to 1005am. They end breakfast at 10 sharp or even a minute or two early. No exceptions. There are also certain places for each item to be ordered which isn't in a logical order or labeled. Is that a difficult task? And when you finally find an item you like, good luck figuring out where to order or stand in line to order. Or who to talk to about placing your order.  They best advice I have on that is to look at the very small signs taped above the cooking area. It kind of says what you can order but it's not 100% accurate or in the right area. Not all stations have signs. Plus you have no idea who to order from or where the line ends/behings so you'll learn by trial and error (and end up with something you didn't order or want.) And God forbid you have a question. You'll get a weird stare if you ask anything (if you're lucky enough to make eye contact) but expect a muffled voice growling out something incoherent. \\nThe drinks are easy because they are on the shelves circling around inside of the cafeteria. All self service. Paying is fairly straightforward as you just find a cashier to bring your food to but make sure the sign of what type of transaction or currency they take can make that difficult as well. \\n\\nAs for the food, as I finally got my order nearly 80% correct for breakfast, it was pretty good. Granted, it was my 5th visit and I was also successful in ordering an omelette but when I asked for bacon (which is in the very near vicinity of the omlettes) I got a quick glare as the staff member had to step one step to the left to obtain the bacon. I'm sure that bacon was to be ordered in yet another obscure area of the cafe but I couldn't tell you exactly.

I ordered the sliced steak specifically because it came with a jalapeno- bacon twice baked potato. The presentation of the dish was pleasing, the potato standing up on its end with the jalapenos and bacon visible on top.  Unfortunately, the potato was extremely undercooked, to the point of being raw in the middle, (a fork would not go through).  Also the potato was never removed from the skin, which is what one thinks of in a twice baked potato.  It was brought to the servers attention and he brought out mashed potatoes, which were very good.

Needless to say they never called to let us our table was ready, and they cancelled our reservation through open table at 10 past 10.  I will NEVER be a patron here.

We picked the restaurant the last time, so our friends picked the restaurant for last Saturday's double date.  They had decided on Wilf's, thinking that this would be a great experience.  Something unique.  A nice dinner, next to the train station; complete with jazz music.  They also had a Groupon, so that made it even more enticing.\\n\\nReviews on Yelp were very mixed.  Some people said the atmosphere and and food were great.  Others said, \\"not so much\\".  Yet, we were still eager to try out a new (to us) steak place.  I'll be honest in that I had never heard of this restaurant, nor did I ever see it on lists of steak restaurants to not miss.  \\n\\nWe parked at the lot across the street from Union Station and paid to park, not realizing that there were some spots dedicated to Wilf's.  We walked over the entrance and into the lobby.  There was a sign stating a $5 cover charge (and additional notes on required food and drink purchases), but no one there at the hostess stand.  We waited for a few moments before just deciding to look for our friends ourselves.\\n\\nOur friends had been there a bit and had ordered drinks.  We looked at their menus to decide what we want.  The Maitre D came over to advise us what we could order and we ordered with our server shortly thereafter.  Cheese plate was fine, nothing to stand out.    When the 2 salads were delivered to the table; we asked the woman if there was also bread service.  \\"Well it WAS going to be brought with dinner...\\" she said with one of the rudest tones I'd ever heard.  \\"Um... we're fine waiting.  We were just checking\\".  She brought over the bread, and her tone had changed considerably.  It was a pretty delicious soft, cheesy sundried tomato and leek.  I've just never had a server so rude or short.  A simple, \\"We normally bring it out with dinner, but I'd be happy to bring it now if you like, etc\\" would have been great.  The salads themselves had so much garlic, making it SPICY.  My husband said he didn't even notice that there was any egg or anchovy.  One of our dining partners couldn't even eat her salad it was so overpowering.  \\n\\nOur entrees came and they were just kinda \\"meh\\".  My Steak Diane was $50 and was OK.  Not terrible, but not worth the price.  The rest of the party felt the same.  The food wasn't BAD, but for that much money; our total bill was more than $250, we wanted more.  I'd much rather fork over a bit extra and get a steak at Urban Farmer or El Gaucho.  Or pay about the same price and go to Saylor's.  \\n\\nThey seemed shorthanded and maybe that was the issue.  As if they used Groupon to try and increase their attendance but then when they were hit with the reality, they just weren't prepared.  \\n\\nOverall, the ambiance was GREAT.  We loved the jazz band, we liked the comfy high back chairs.  Food was mediocre at best  Service was lacking.  Besides no one at the hostess stand and the one rude and short server, our main server wasn't around much.  We were waiting for our final check and our friend tried several times to get the attention of our server.  She was spending a great deal of time with the table behind us (who had several bottles of wine open.  Perhaps she was hoping for a bigger tip from them?)  Maybe a place we would come for drinks and a show, but wouldn't come back for the food.

My friend thought the burnt marshmallows were overwhelming and put them to the side. We ordered the tune crisps as an appetizer. I ate these while I decided on my burger, they have a lot of options and my decision was being influenced by my trusty dusty yelpers. I was leaning towards the lamb burger guy to try something new, considering I am not a huge fan of lamb ribs. When the server came I asked for his recommendations. He named about 6 burgers going in depth about his personal opinions about them, something I really appreciated. He said his top favorite was the tune tartare burger. I wasn't sure about it because I already had the tune crisps. But I went for it anyways and with a lettuce wrap! My friend ordered the RBQ. Food came out, presented beautifully. My friend got the duck fat fries which I tasted they were really good! My lettuce wrap was good but I think I should have went with the lamb burger because I did tuna for my appetizer.

My GF and I had previously been to Pier 6 and thought the unrivaled view of the Boston skyline would be appreciated.\\n\\nOur first visit had been on just some odd Tuesday night.  The weather was meh - overcast but not quite raining - so we decided to eat inside.  The (upstairs) dining room is small and crowded, and I found the service to be lacking.  The hostess was more interested in her phone than us, and despite the roof deck not being full the waitstaff seemed overwhelmed.  The food was okay - I thought the portion sizes on my scallops were a little small (only about a half-dozen grilled sea scallops) but they were tasty and well-cooked.\\n\\nOur visit last night (Sunday evening) was very different!  The place was PACKED!  The downstairs bars was overflowing and it was standing room only in the dining room, with a 30-minute wait for a table.  Fortunately we had reservations and our table on the roof deck was ready for us.  The weather was perfect and the view of Boston couldn't be beat.\\n\\nThis time, despite all the people, service was top-notch!  There was a bit of a wait on drinks, but the waitstaff checked in on us frequently.  The fried calamari appetizer was light and crunchy, and best of all it was fresh: both rings and tentacles!  The clam chowder was great, and the steamed mussels were large, plump, garlicky, and full of juice and flavor!\\n\\nI had the Pier 6 burger.  It was an average pre-made 6oz burger - nothing really special.  That was my fault for ordering the burger, I guess!  My mother had the linguine with clams.  When it showed up with a half dozen fresh littlenecks on top I figured those six clams were the extent of what would be in the dish.  Boy was I wrong!  It was FULL of clams!  Even after she finished the pasta there were four or five large spoons fully of fresh clams left in the bowl!  My GF had the lobster roll.  Not being a fan of lobster it's difficult for me to rate it, but she said it was very good.\\n\\nMy suggestions are make reservations if you are going on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday evening in the summer, and parking is a bit of a pain!  You can park on the pier for ~$15 or you can try to find on-the-street parking (which is difficult to find and requires quite the walk), but even the on-the-pier parking is limited.  They do have dockside access if you want to pull up in your boat (not sure if there is a fee or not).  The roof deck doesn't have umbrellas, so if you burn easily (like me) make sure you bring sunblock.  That being said, the roof deck is definitely the place to sit if weather permits!!!!\\n\\nThe upstairs dining room and roof deck do not appear to be wheelchair accessible, so that will limit some customers."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is probably one of the oldest Indian restaurants in Austin and I've eaten there several times.

It was perfect.  It was very intimate, because the restaurant was very small.  It reminded me of the best restaurant I ate at in Rome.  Our waitress was very nice and very attentive, without being intrusive.  We had the fried artichokes, the burrata bruschetta, caesar-like salad for appetizers that we all shared.  Then we had the bolognese, scallops on top of pesto and walnut papardelle, and cappelini con Gamberi.  The waitress suggested the tomato linguine instead of the cappelini, which was a perfect substitution.  Everybody cleared their plates.  The desserts were just as decadent.  They were really good at clearing our plates when we were done and filling our water and suggesting wine.  The only thing that seemed off was the bread that is given at the beginning of the meal was really cold.  I would have thought that a restaurant that is so good at everything, would know that people want warm bread.  Otherwise, it was all great and will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a really good italian experience in the North End."},{"name":"Gusto Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Not being too familiar with the offerings on Burnet, we were feeling a little peckish after a shopping trip to Russell Korman.  I had been to Blue Star, but was curious as to what this Italian wine bar had to offer.  Pleasantly appointed surroundings welcomed us as we entered and we made our way to our usual seats in a restaurant, the bar.  We were greeted by a young man smiling and asking us if we would like something to drink.  Birthday girl grabbed a Martini and I settled for a cold one.  Not really feeling the need to get something substantial, just a few bites as we made our way leisurely home.  I spotted the PEI Mussels and we also ordered up the Calamari.  Actually called Fritto Misto.  Our bartender was attentive and busy!  As I watched him prepare drinks, he was quite proficient and skilled.  Our appy's arrived.  The PEI Mussels were abundant and not a closed one in the bunch.  The broth was as traditional as one could expect.  Flavorful broth of white wine, garlic and shallot's rounded out the dish and a nice toasted focaccia was on top to sop up all the broth.  The Fritto was excellent.  Whole small wedges of lemon and artichoke bits encrusted with the semolina batter was something we had not experienced before.  However, it was excellent.  I would of never thought to eat a complete lemon wedge this way or anyway for that  matter, but this added to the dish.  The calamari was a generous helping and included the tentacles which far to often are left out.  We inquired the bartender about any other place on the street we should check out while in the hood, and he recommended we check out apothecary just a short walk away.  This turned out to be a stellar recommendation.  I like the fact that he would recommend a competitor if you would.  Great little spot on Burnet and we will be dropping in again soon for a full dinner."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My favorite part of this place is the atmosphere.

If you go to M+C you have to try the spring rolls (2 for $5). They  have a delightful, light and flaky crust.\\n\\nThird pass: Tiger Tears - I wasn't paying attention because I thought it was a soup and it turned out to be a salad. But a damn tasty salad. The beef is extremely tender and marbled and a little smoky (think beef jerky flavor).  The fresh basil and mint leaves with the spicy, lime dressing make for a invigorating, bright salad. I have no idea what the hard, white crunch things were but they were a great alternative to, say, croutons, to add a little crunch.

Me being a gluttonous pig, I wanted the 9 course meal, but was quickly asked if I have ever eaten there before. Our server, Zack, simply said that the 9 course is quite a bit of food, and that IF you really were still hungry .... we'll see how it goes. I trusted him and agreed, especially since my wife is not a huge eater and I would have ended up eating 80% of the dinner.\\n\\nThe first course was a burrata cheese and salumi. It was a wonderful opener to a soon to be fantastic meal.

At this point Zack came by to see how we were doing and let us know that there was going to be a main and a dessert left. I was still feeling a touch hungrier and wanted to try more so he recommended a half order of the gnocchi ai funghi. OMG this was amazing !!! So buttery and rich. The deep mushroom flavors came through so perfectly with the gnocchi. This is going to be my goto dish if I need a quick pasta fix !!! The main course was a trio of lamb. The lamb chop was HANDS DOWN the BEST LAMB CHOP I have ever had. The most tender and succulent lamb I've had. We finished off with a trio of desserts; flourless chocolate cake, a quince tart, apple strudel and caramel ice cream. \\n\\nWe were completely satisfied and happy that Zack was so attentive with the recommendations.

Then Manager GEORGE slid by rudely saying \\"I'm gonna make this quick, we don't sit incomplete parties!\\" My husband & I then said this will Not be quick b/c that's not our question. GEORGE then walked away shouting \\"it is quick b/c I'm leaving now and we don't need or want your business!\\" He was literally shouting from the kitchen at us while we were trying to leave our booth. Keep in mind, we haven't even asked our question or raised our voices to deserve this treatment. He then told us to go to IHOP.

She said, \\"It tastes like the corn was just sliced off the cob.\\"\\n\\nWe were not done until both of the metal containers were empty, and at that point we were very well fed.  The price was very reasonable for a tasty Indian dinner in a classy environment.  I also like that this place has many selections beyond the usual Indian choices that many are used to.\\n\\nOnly reasons I didn't give 5 stars: 1) they were a little disorganized when we came in, and were slow to seat us (and some other diners) even though empty tables were available.\\n2) My gf ordered something medium spicy, and the waiter asked if she was afraid of spicy food.

For those who do not know, shawarma is a certain collection of spices typically cured on chicken or lamb on a giant spinning spit. The good news? Chef Ginsberg's shawarma is freaking wonderful. Tender chicken, incredible flavor, and made even better with all of the incredible mise en place before you -- pickles, sauerkraut, hummus, babba, etc. \\n\\nHummus and pita - Just fantastic. Wonderful, chewy pita, amazing hummus with great flavor and perfect texture. \\n\\nDear sweet lord of flavor, do yourselves a favor and order one of the craft sodas. They are WONDERFUL.

So if you plan on coming here, I suggest you plan accordingly, because this place filled up fast.\\n\\nThis place also has specials that the waitress will tell you, and I partook in both a special cocktail and sandwich.  The cocktail was a raspberry mojito which definitely made it feel more like spring, and the sandwich consisted of proscuito (baah i can't spell and am too lazy to try to figure it out) some other hams and cheese,  wasn't really that special.\\n\\nHowever, my friends ordered the spicy tuna burger, which was actually really amazing, and coming from me (someone who hates their fish cooked) is a compliment, and the meatloaf club.

Honestly that would be something I would have sent back just because over salted mashed potatoes... really?\\n\\nDespite the mishaps and downfalls,  I really enjoyed the restaurant, ambiance, and staff.

After having the pressure put onto me by my family during the Christmas vacation to eat somewhere that has real Texas barbecue, I was a little more stumped to find this in Austin around 8pm than I had originally thought. For some reason, barbecue restaurants close surprisingly early: around six or seven in the evening. I originally chose Lamberts downtown, but then after showing up and seeing how snooty it was for \\"bbq\\" I made sure to try somewhere else, but was running out of time. My family grew up in Texas so we have tried our fair share of barbeque, and we wanted to try somewhere new that was also going to fulfill our high standards.\\n\\nTerry Black's performed flawlessly in the Texas barbeque department. The turkey was literally some of the best turkey I have ever eaten. It didn't really even require any sauce, although I'm a sucker for bbq sauce and this is another aspect of this restaurant that passes with flying colors: they have three choices of sauces, and all of them are tasty and unique in their own way, without straying too far away from the realm of authentic Texas barbecue. \\n\\nThe lean brisket was good, although I'll admit that I'm not much of a brisket connoisseur. I felt like it was at the high-end of previous briskets I have tried, but not the best. This is no small feet, and it was good enough for me since I don't put emphasis on it anyway.\\n\\nI am a big fan of how they offer their side dishes here: they let you choose anything you want, and they are all $2. You can even do a meal deal with two sides, which I ended up choosing. Every side was superb, especially since other major barbecue restaurants regard side dishes as an afterthought and only offer a couple. Terry Black's had at least a handful, and you can fill your plate with as big of a portion as you like.\\n\\nThe decor is a big gaudy and brightly-lit, but for a barbecue place this is to be expected and does not lose points as hardcore county folks probably prefer this type of decor. It shows that they truly know the genre, if anything.\\n\\nMy final statement is that, after coming here, I have questioned my allegiance to Rudy's BBQ. I used to think they were one of the top bbq spots in Austin although now my spectrum has broadened and they have been reduced a few points down on my personal list. The biggest complaints I've always had with that type of fast-food style bbq is the small side order portions and the expensive price for those side orders. Also, the quality of the meats were so much better at Terry Black's. I also like the location and the availability of parking in their private lot. I'm not sure why this restaurant has received the low reviews that it has, I'm definitely going to make it a point to tell my friends about this place and visit again when I'm in Austin."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Horrible experience here.

At first I thought this was some sort of mixup but then realized this employee was acting like a jackass accusing me of something that did not happen.\\n\\nI was incredulous and have never stolen anything in my life.

The appetizers were simple but savory. We ordered fried artichokes which was more delicate and flavorful than it sounds and the tomato bruschetta. They must have grilled the bread with some kind of flavored wood because it was crisp and smoky on the outside and soft on the inside. This smoky flavor really elevated the accompanying tomato, garlic, fresh basil, and balsamic dressing. \\n\\nNow, for the main dish I am really picky about pasta because that is essentially all a vegetarian can eat in the North End (other than risotto). So when I can tell you that I absolutely loved their pasta primavera with spinach fettuccini, you better believe it was amazing. The pasta was fresh and green. It was cooked in this lovely white wine sauce, and it was chock full of vegetables that provided different textures to the pasta -- brussels sprouts, broccoli, mushrooms, bell peppers.

My sandwich looked like it was thrown onto a place right before service.  My wife's dish was extremely bland looking and unappetizing.  They also ran out of beers very early in the night which was quite a disappointment for a place that offers a lot of options.  The menu is fairly big but wonder if that is a detriment at times.

Arriving a few minutes before our reservation, we, party of two,  were seated immediately.  However, the dining room was so dark that neither of us could read our menus.

Perhaps the bar noise contributed.\\n\\nUpon placing our order, once again, the inference was placed on how special it must be for us to be in your presence. Our appetizer was a little slow coming out of the kitchen.  The pot stickers were ok.  I've had better at a much lower price point.  They were not served hot.  Oh, and when serving a single order of pot stickers, either don't bring chopsticks or bring enough for everyone.  Forks work just fine.  \\n\\nI ordered the ahi tuna, my wife ordered the shrimp and crab salad.  Once again, it took a bit of patience waiting for our mains.  My tuna was cooked to perfection but was a bit under seasoned.  The biggest disappointed was my side of Brussels sprouts.  If you are going to serve them al dente, then they should be cut down a bit.  They were too chewy and a bit bland.  Again, a little more seasoning would have helped\\n\\nMy wife's salad was pretty good.  The shrimp looked a little strange.  It could have been the lighting.

I am all about experimental foods, combinations, and flavors - but this just wasn't very good.\\n\\nThe tuna was somewhat bland and exceptionally small (my mom got that, and she is a light eater, and left needing a meal). I am all about small portions with amazing taste. But if you are going to charge $18 for what amounts to a small snack it better be amazing. Serving tiny portions of very average food for relatively high prices = not cool. Especially not at a brewery.\\n\\nThe burger was average (there are SO many better burgers all around Portland).

While it's not as delicious as the Mediterranean in Dearborn (nothing is), it will do the trick between my yearly visits home.\\n\\nFirst, we started w/ the Mezza Sampler - while most of the stuff on there is pretty good, we all weren't the biggest fans of the dolma. Maybe it's good dolma, and maybe we just don't like dolma period. I don't know since it's really the first time I have had it. Next we split the Shwarma plate and the Lamb La Zeez. The Shwarma was just okay, but the La Zeez was fantastic. The spices were amazing - it was definitely the most popular dish of the evening.\\n\\nThe prices work, and the fact that you can bring in your own beer or wine is pretty fantastic. They do change $3/glass for corkage. Not a bad price, but certainly don't rely on the liquor store nearby for a good selection of wines. My suggestion is that you hit King Liquor over on Burnet first - they are the best.\\n\\nThe inside seating is pretty low-key, which can be nice, or it might bore you. The patio is pretty nice - definitely the better choice provided that the weather cooperates. The belly dancing is, eh, belly dancing... I guess it just depends on how you feel about it.

That's not even fair. You knew I didn't stand a chance. \\n\\nI'm not a fan of chili on cheeseburgers. It seems to make the bun weird and soggy and is usually a good idea in theory, but rarely executed well. Not so with this place. \\n\\nThe \\"Terlingua\\" burger is a burger with chili, cheese and Fritos atop it, like some kind of majestic love song to fat kids. I think this works because the Fritos tend to soak up some of the chili, holding it in place. The burger comes with a dressing-ish type of sauce (\\"Sassy Sauce\\") made of thousand island, mayo and something else (not a fan of mayo) which I did not try, but my wife had it and she likes it so, there you go. She had the regular cheeseburger and we shared a large order of fries (they were massive). The fries only come in two sizes: fatass and super fatass, so with that said, two people sharing one large is less likely to drawing stares like one might if they ordered the large on their own (It looks like you slaughtered Mr. Potato head, his family, and all his Irish brethren and served them up with delicious sea salt and parsley). \\n\\nTons of Maine Root drinks to choose from, as well as a full bar with local (read: badass) Texas brews. My wife opted at the end, for a Salted Caramel shake. Salted Caramel is everywhere right now, and unless it's done right, it seems like a gimmick (see: Nobu, NYC). They handle business like a bawss here, with Amy's Mexican Vanilla, fresh whipped cream and caramel salted with sea salt.

However, there wasn't a lot of beef and it had more green onions than anything else. \\n\\nThe fried basa fish with corn sauce was a favourite. It was lightly fried and there was a side dish which one has to add the thick corn sauce. The fried fish didn't taste greasy which was great. \\n\\nThe steamed cod and eggplant dish looked great. It was a piece of eggplant with a slice of cod on top with some green onions and chives. Unfortunately, the dish tasted too salty.

The beef was just that, beef since a lot of places that serve carne guisada do so but with a lot of fat still attached to it, not so here, it was delicious and very filling.  The rice was what surprised me the most, not often do you find rice that actually has flavor and this once, although not the best, made me a fan.  The beans, on the other hand were a bit disappointing.  I love charro beans but these were your typical mass produced fare - very apparent due to the large chunks of tomato.\\n\\nThe service though, is another story.  Our waitress didn't seem in too much of a rush to serve us or others, for that matter.

Both were quite lovely. Next time I will again order the tart and the escargot. My friend had the steak frites with herb butter for her entree, and I opted for a special which was pheasant, duck, and rabbit confit in a meat pie in some sort of sauce with mushrooms. My meal was quite well prepared, tasted good, and was very filling. However, it lacked that je-ne-sais-quoi.... Don't get me wrong. It was good. But I wasn't rolling my eyes back and emitting foodgasmic moans with each bite. It might be my own fault because I had duck confit on my mind all day leading up to dinner but was talked into ordering the special by our waiter. My friend's steak frites was alright. The fries were great, actually, as I kept stealing them off her plate. The steak itself was pretty good but I think it got cold really fast. In fact, it may never have been that hot to begin with since the blob of butter on top of the steak wasn't even close to melting. Taste-wise, it was nice. \\n\\nFor dessert, we had the creme brulee that everyone has been raving about. This was really nice. The creme brulee had a perfect sugar crackle on top that was a great compliment to every creamy bite. The consistency was surprisingly more pudding-like than I expected, but I actually found this to be really pleasant. The bottom of the dish had quite a bit of vanilla bean. I can understand why people consider this to be among the best creme brulees in Vancouver. I'll go back for that. \\n\\nLastly, I want to mention that there's the restaurant, and the cafe next door. Marc D called it a nice afterthought in his review of the cafe. It's a tiny little space with just a few tables and a few seats at the bar. This is where the overflow from the restaurant is seated. Same menu, different atmosphere. In fact, possibly a bit more cozy and relaxed. The restaurant itself was packed to the max, so I was happy to enjoy the ambiance of the cafe. It felt a little more.... like a bistro. Homey. Comfy. Welcoming. Next time, I'll likely ask to be seated there.

Here's why:\\n\\n- Very relaxing outdoor seating. Staff doesn't push you to get up and turn the table either. Nice to enjoy a beautiful night without rushing through the experience.\\n\\n- Everyone was nice from Phara (who came around to tables to thank them for coming in) to the hostess. She even let us pick our table.\\n\\n- Belly dancing. The finger cymbals got a little loud when she was right behind our table, but all and all a welcome form of entertainment.\\n\\n- BYOB! So much cheaper than buying onsite. Plus we had exactly what we liked. No problem there.\\n\\n- Hummus is creamy and delicious. Also, I recommend the Aloo Chana. I knew my BF was ordering the lamb shank so I wanted to even things out with something veggie.\\n\\n- Overall, ambiance was just perfect. Good Austin vibe but not in any way the new pretentious or \\"hip\\" kind. Off the beaten path too so it's kind of a nice find. I don't know of any other place like this in town.\\n\\nWhile I had an excellent experience, there are just some details that has this place falling short of five stars:\\n\\n- The lamb shank. My BF ordered it and I tasted it. I really like lamb and I thought it was just another piece of meat. Nothing distinctive. It came with a good sauce. He even said though that since we came late it had probably been cooking all day. When he'd come before it was much better.\\n\\n- They leave a plastic woven basket at each table to tip the belly dancer. I mean, we were kind of pressured to tip at that point. Although I really didn't mind, it was probably the best way to ensure that she made some dough. Be aware of this and bring small bills.\\n\\n- I can't ever turn down baklava, but if I go back I might try the mango ice cream instead. The baklava was good but not gooey enough--does that make sense? Didn't taste homemade. Not a deal breaker though, I still ate it!\\n\\n- We didn't smoke any hookah but were approached at least twice by staff who asked if we ordered some. No problem, but they should probably get just a little more organized about their tables and such.\\n\\nI think the lamb was the most expensive thing on the menu, but it was still a reasonably priced evening. If you're in a rush this might not be the place for you, as it's pretty laid back.

I'm from Oahu and had the pleasure of eating here yesterday with friends. It was 102 outside so I wasn't up to trying too many hot dishes but tried the Manini slider (Kalua pork ((Hawaiian style pulled pork)) on Hawaiian sweet bread roll), coconut shrimp skewer and the poke plate. Wow did everything bring me home! The poke was super fresh and it comes in a very generous portion (almost half your plate!) with rice and your choice of cucumber salad or slaw. Now, some people may be turned off when they say the slaw is \\"oil based\\" but trust me, you WANT to order it. It's not oily at all. It has less oil in it then a regular vinaigrette dressing and is super refreshing and crunchy. Think of it as a light cabbage salad. The poke had the perfect amount of flavoring on it and comes with a twist, it has some pickled ginger mixed in it. At first I wasn't sold on the thought of it, but I must admit that it was a welcome addition. It added just a bit of acidity to the poke and wasn't overwhelming in the least. It still allowed all the ingredients to shine and for the tuna flavor to come through. For those who like the spicy aioli (spicy mayo) flavor, they give you a little bit of their \\"Lava sauce\\" on the side and you can order more if you please. \\nThe Manini slider was a pleasant surprise for me. It was super flavorful! More than a traditional Kalua pork. The pork was tender and again, what ever sauce they used, it still allowed the pork to shine through. The coconut shrimp was an added bonus for me since I'm usually not a huge fan of it. The shrimp were a good size and I loved that they used bigger flakes of coconut so that you could really taste the coconut with the shrimp. \\n\\nIn closing, love love LOVE their food. This couple from Maui knows how to balance their flavors and you can taste the Ohana in their food. Even if you're a purist with flavors, I guarantee that they will make you believers with their authentic and sometimes creative approaches to Hawaiian food.

Our group of four cleaned up every crumb and morsel so why two stars off?   Several detractors take away from the experience.  The first item was the lack of water to drink. I bought an expensive 5$ Beverage and I also wanted some water.  There wasn't any to be had after I asked twice.  I left very thirsty.  The price is sky high.  A very light lunch was $15.  Also nothing was priced in the cooler or snack shelf so I'm just guessing my drink was about 5$.  Could have been more.  My two friends ordered a sandwich to split and were handed two plates to take to the table.  The plate on bottom was covered in soap suds.  I've never had to complain that something was too clean but now I am.  Also the music is super loud inside.  I just wanted a chill afternoon but got some in your face music.  So maybe the answer is to save up and go for take out?  All in all I prefer Rainbow grocery in Decatur.  Could have gotten the same lunch for half the price and half the grief.

This place is the real deal Hollyfield...at 1st bite we were knocked out. As soon as we exited the car that heavenly smell of pits took me to my happy place. As we entered through the doors we were greeted immediately and I loved how we were asked if it was our first time. Ginger and the cashier (can't remember her name) were the best. I felt like I was working with my own personal BBQ concierge. Then a sample of the food - OMG the food. Ooh-wee was it good! I typically don't eat turkey from BBQ joints because it's usually dry so I turned up my nose when offered a sample, but when I saw it being cut for the hubs and those juices flowing I was in. Sauce? Negatory! You don't need sauce if you Q it right and they nailed it. The staff took care of us promptly and professionally and even took it further to engage my little one who was going through withdrawals and had to have a Sprite! The best part was being told about the pit tour. Say what?!?! A tour...of pits...I'm so there! Zach & Andrew were amazing to take the time to show us around, answer our questions, and most importantly show they care about customers. All and all it was a wonderful experience and this has become our new family fav never mind the 30-45 min drive. We only got meat this time...hoping to try sides/desserts on the next visit.

The entire waitstaff was wonderful - patient, helpful and genuinely pleased to see us. The decor was simple with low lighting and an eclectic alt-indie playlist on the sound system. There were only a few tables which were empty but noise didn't seem to be  problem. Also, we went on New Year's Eve and this was one of the few restaurants around that didn't offer those irritating special Prix Fixe menus for holidays.\\n\\nWe ordered our dishes a couple at a time to pace ourselves and enjoy our cocktails. We ordered the Bloodlust, a margarita style drink and the Pineapple Express, a sweeter, more fruity drink which were both pretty good but not mind blowing. For our dishes we started with a Tiger's Tears salad, served cold with slices of beef and bell peppers and sliced hot chili peppers with generous flavors of lime and cilantro. We also had Mama Chang's Pork and Chive Potstickers which were fried just right and came with a decent but not too plentiful sauce. Both were amazing. Next came the Braised Pork Belly Buns and the  Pork Lettuce Wraps. Delicious. The pork in the lettuce wraps came in four small pieces (nuggets) of ground pork which was a good idea so the pork didn't fall all over the place. Finally, our appetites were waning a little but everything was so good we decided to try the Ginger Scallion Bok Choy and the Hot Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles. The Bok Choy was the kind of dish I would hope I could duplicate at home, seasoned just right with wonderful flavor. The noodles were pretty good, but a little heavy on the oil though it had a nice smoky, peppery flavor.

It's a beef patty with barbecued brisket and cole slaw on top. I tend to switch up burgers. Every burger has been decent for an artisan burger.\\n\\nI say \\"artisan\\" because this is not the place you go when you're craving a huge hunk of beef in your mouth. This is where you go when you want to try something interesting, take someone out on a hip, but casual date, or bring an out-of-town guest to give them something accessible, locally inspired, and innovative. We often go there when we want to feel like we're getting a top-notch meal without a hefty price tag. I make sure to order a salad and we share a few sides (both the fries and the sweet potato tots are awesome. No love for the onion rings, but you can't win 'em all). The burgers aren't huge, maybe 5oz, which plays to the toppings instead of the meat.\\n\\nOur favorite at this restaurant is the milkshakes. We have never gone without getting one. Even after the gimicky nitrogen freeze has worn off, the flavors are OUTSTANDING. The Krispy Kreme one is out of this world. I will probably remember the taste for the rest of my life.

Not a big deal right, but when we informed her she first said no it's unsweet. Um, would you like to try it, it was definitely sweet. So she brought us knew teas. Then with her bare hands she grabbed both of our straws from our previous drinks and moved them into our new drinks. Then when our food came and our server was refilling our teas, she accidentally spilled some tea and ice into our queso. She proceeded in grabbing my employees USED fork to scoop out the ice. Not offering to replace or remove from the bill. \\n\\nOn to instance #2: We went on Friday night this past week and after waiting for 2.5 hours for a table and taken to the back to be seating only to be told to stand there and weight longer and then another manager came and told us we needed to wait in the front. I'm sorry, it was your other manager there that brought us back here. \\n\\nInstance #3:I returned to this location, not sure why at this point, with a girl friend for dinner and drinks. In my drink was a dead fly. When I alerted the server who was delivering our food, he grabbed the drink, looked inside and walked off. He didn't say a thing. Then we sat there for over 5 minutes waiting for him to come back, not that we could have eaten anyway because we did not have utensils. So when he finally did come back and ask, oh what do y'all need utensils....

This specific review is based on about 50 visits, most recently a few months ago. \\n\\nWhat I'm comparing it against: delis in any size city/town, small or large.\\n\\nVibe: There are two kinds of great sandwich shops in America and elsewhere--the gritty, usually Italian, Jewish or Polish delicatessen found in your larger cities like NYC's Faicco's or Chicago's JP Graziano or even Columbus' (OH)  Katzinger's. Loud, bustling and a full punch of roasted red pepper smell in your face as you enter (that's a good thing). Then there's the other great sandwich shop--typically located in a small artsy town (perhaps a liberal arts college town, perhaps not) with Tori Amos (\\"Little Earthquakes\\"-era) and 10,000 Maniacs (with Natalie, not that other girl) playing softly in the background (also a good thing). The Brown Bag Deli is such a place. First, the location is perfect--in my favorite C-Bus neighborhood of German Village, and that too a great spot near Schiller Park. Contrast that with Katzinger's (a great place in the same general neighborhood), whose outdoor seating leaves with you with a not-so-lovely (and sometimes car exhaust-filled) view of the unappealing Livingston/S. Third Street intersection. Brown Bag is within one block of the park, has a very nice location for outdoor seating and quant/homey indoor seating. Oh, and the menu and specials are written on chalkboards...quite possibly the definitive sign of a quality deli.    \\n\\nFood: Um yeah, I love this place. But keep in mind this isn't the huge-cuts-of-pastrami place like Katz in NYC--Brown Bag is a place I advise getting a sandwich (make your own or use the menu) paired with soup and a side (also have desserts). They usually have one or two soups of the say, plus literally 7-10 sides. If you live in C-Bus, you should get their sandwich punch card for an eventual free sandwich (I \\"think\\" that's still there--don't quote me though). As for making your own sandwich, they have a variety of ingredients to play around with. Example--I usually got provolone, smoked turkey, mayo and pesto (mixed together on both sides as a spread), roasted red peppers, and either cucumbers or spinach on either ciabatta or sourdough grilled. Have fun at this place. Everything fresh, nothing processed.  \\nAlso got some cool soda companies (like Dr. Brown's). Plus, an \\"abbreviated\\" Jeni's Ice Cream location is next door--two birds with one stone.\\n\\nService: It's a deli, so no table service. People are nice--I say that because they've always been patient with my absurd sandwich orders.  \\nOverall: On my definitive lists of top neighborhood delis of all time, this place is somewhere in the top 5. This list may or may not (probably not) be featured in magazines in the years to come. I'll also give a \\"shout out\\" to my other favorite sandwich place in the city--Si Senor near the Statehouse...review coming \\"soon-ish.\\""},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this little diner and it's our breakfast go-to in south ATX.

He gave us a brief spiel about bartaco's menu and recommended some items. This place looks super expensive but is actually dirt cheap! We ordered chicken and fish tacos (about $3 each), chips and salsa, stewed beans, corn, and key lime pie for dessert. I will say the tacos are bite sized. If you're looking to get full, you may need to order a few. The salsas here are so delicious! Very fresh and tasty. I will say the key lime pie was disgusting! I never had key lime pie before so I didn't know what to expect, but after tasting my friends pie, I know I won't ever eat key lime pie again. Overall, pretty delicious place with good vibes.

They manager literally walked around yelling in a megaphone looking for people instead of having buzzers. Not exactly good for the beaching summer crowd you get at this location. I had a dark and stormy for my first drink. It was the WORST I EVER HAD. My brother had a margarita and had to send it back it was also gross. I doubt they actually used goslings in my drink. The food came out quickly. I had a cup of chowder for an app and a wrap for dinner both were good but the chowder was so hot that I couldn't eat it by the Time the food came out.\\n\\nAll of that aside, let's get to the real reason for this 1 star review. THE OWNER WAS SO RUDE. Like I said we were regulars at the old place so we had some gift cards. We knew they probably wouldn't be accepted but figured we would just ask the owner. My mother had to try no less than 6TIMES to ask her a question before she finally got it out without being rudely interrupted by the owner telling her she knows nothing about the old restaurant and ranting about how bad the owner was at the old restaurant. She literally wouldn't let us ask her a question. \\n\\nNext she came over after the dinner and asked how it was. We told her the food was good and didn't say anything about the drinks. We did quite nicely and with a smile that the chowder was very good but was extraordinarily hot and inedible for almost 15 minutes. Her reaction astonished me. SHE LAUGHED IN OUR FACES and continued to belittle and ridicule us by telling us how petty a complaint that was and that it wasn't a real problem.\\n\\nI also had a friend who was sitting outside when a squeal rolled in and there were heavy winds blowing their food around they asked to come back in. The owner flat out said no!!! \\"If you sit you commit\\". Lady this is a restaurant where we come to relax not a preschool.\\n\\nI have never met someone so rude in the service industry.

The experience started out well with a great atmosphere and a very nice manager. However, that was all rendered null and void when the food came out. They serve the bread and oil but pour it in such a way that all the herbs stay in the bowl and you don't get any on your plate. Then we had the Rafiki fries which were described as being prepared with truffle oil. At no point did I taste anything remotely \\"truffle-y\\" and I even got a mouth full of dirt at one point. When I went to clean the dirt out of my mouth with a sip of water my glass tasted like a spoonful of dish soap. Also, there is no ice in the water. On a hot day that would have been appreciated. So, I ordered an iced tea. Beware there are no free refills on iced tea. That was a cruel surprise when they brought the bill. Now onto the main dishes. The grilled pizza had a burnt crust, it was bland, and the only saving grace was the broccoli we asked them to add. I ordered the California herb encrusted white fish with a fettuccine pasta. It was the special so you would think it'd be good...but you would be wrong. It was AWFUL! The fish was oily, tasteless, and it was jiggling from being cooked so badly. The texture upset my stomach. The only good thing on the plate was the artichokes. Then I got the bill and had to pay $22 for this heap of jiggly junk. The only thing special about this special is how bad it was. This place needs to get a new chef if they plan to stay in business.

(Okay, it's less than a hour closer to Laredo, but there's little disputing the quantity and quality of San Antonio's taquer√≠as.)  Luckily, Kathyrn had to suffer less than I, as my journey to the Pacific Northwest planted me here in 1996.  Since then, my quest for even serviceable Mexican food has been a near complete failure.  I've done Alberta, Hillsboro, and anything that looks like a hole in the wall...yeah, I was that desperate.  Then a buddy and I are starving one day and catch wind that this place is decent.  I ask the gal behind the counter for a recommendation, and verde enchiladas are it...and are they ever.  Covered with a delicious tomatillo sauce and fresh cilantro, onion, and cotilla cheese, these babies came straight from heaven or Mexico...or both!  The tacos, too, stand out, not just for their contents (carnitas and chicken are best, and both remain succulent, even though the latter are diced) but for what's on the outside:  the corn tortilla.  Growing up on Tex Mex, I favored the flour tortilla.  But I now realize I never had a great corn tortilla.  Other joints try to cover up their store-bought tortillas by doubling them up (since the less fresh ones dry out and easily crack in two) or have a texture and taste not dissimilar from leather.  These tacos come in a single corn tortilla so perfect my gringo words cannot describe.  So I'll move on.  Yes, as Kathryn O stated, the mole poblano is the best EVER.  Better than anything I've had, period.  Get the mole chicken enchiladas for proof.  Each batch of mole sauce takes two days to make.  Most other restaurants serve the canned stuff, but not here.  Lastly, do the menudo, if you can, pun intended, stomach it.  Known to cure hangovers and, according to me, dreary Portland winters.

Just as we were starting to get frustrated with the delay, the hostess led us to possibly the worst table in the house (the corner of the kitchen entrance and hallway for the bathrooms).  Not to be deterred, we began to peruse the menu in search of the evening's fare.  After a few minutes, we decided on the Mezze dinner, which is a tasting of several appetizers and a shared entr√©e.  The only problem was, we had yet to see a waiter, busboy, waterboy, runner, manager, Greek God, Cherub or anyone willing to help us out.  After another fifteen minutes or so, we were approached by what appeared to be our waiter in spite of the hallowed out cheeks, sunken eyes and myopic stare most commonly associated with heroin addicts and psychopaths. \\nLee Harvey Waiter informed us of the 86's, one of which happened to be something we wanted to order.  It was 8:15 on Saturday - you would think they would have planned ahead, no? After rearranging our menu, we decided on the following for dinner:  Wood Grilled Octopus, Calamari Steak, Sardine filets and Bakaliaros (fried cod meatballs on top of garlic potato puree) with the Rack of Lamb served with Greek Fries.   \\nThis was the absolute best Octopi I have ever eaten. Rather than the chewy, rubbery shoe leather that I'm used to, it was soft, tender, flavorful and simply divine and balanced perfectly with the acidity of pickled red onions and red wine vinegar. Close on its heels (or should I say tentacles) was the calamari steak.  My first impression was shock, as I had never seen a piece of calamari this large before.  It was as if Captain Nemo sailed the Nautilus directly from the Bahamas to deliver this freakish squid to my plate.  It was seasoned perfectly with a hint of lemon and olive oil and cooked very well.\\nNext came the sardines. Let me tell you something about sardines.  They are a greasy, stinky, dirty, foul little fish.  I forced down 2 of the filets just to make sure the first one wasn't accidentally pulled from the trash.  It wasn't.  Next to come out was the Bakaliaros. While not quite as good as the Baccalo that I had in Brazil, they were probably as good as I will ever find in Georgia.  The cod was light, flaky and fried to perfection with the perfect amount of salt and complimented nicely by the garlic potato puree on which they were served.  I never thought I would use cod to cleanse my palate, but it did a surprisingly good job of getting rid of the sardine taste in my mouth. \\nFinally, the rack of lamb and greek fries were delivered.  The lamb was tender and flavorful, but swimming in lemon marinade.  The meatiness of the lamb was totally overwhelmed by the tartness and acidity of citrus, and in my mind, ruined the dish.  On the other hand, the Greek Fries were flawless potato gems worthy of a spot in The French Fry Hall of Fame. Unlike traditional fries, they were discs rather than javelins and fried to a perfect golden brown - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and topped with shredded Kefalograviera cheese.  Truly stunning.  \\nWe plowed through desert and by the time we got and paid our bill, we had been in the place for nearly three hours, which I guess you could say added to the authenticity of a Greek restaurant.  \\nGood, but not sure it was worth the 3 hour experience."},{"name":"Dedham House of Pizza","address":"376 Washington St","city":"Dedham","stars":"3.5","text":"Some of the tastiest pizza I've ever had!

A couple handful of seats if you can't wait to devour your donut right away, sit at the window and watch passersby steal glances with envy. Wash it down with a great cup of Stumptown coffee -- believe it or not, I do manage to come in here just for coffee sometimes. When I do, it's always hard to walk out without a donut but it's worth stepping in just for the aroma and to see what today's selection offers. \\n\\nI work a few doors down from this spot so it's a no-brainer morning treat for the office. It's where I send my out-of-town guests who ask about Voodoo. Blue Star is a place where they get inventive to maximize flavor profiles without trying to be outrageous. \\n\\nSome classics that are usually offered: \\n\\nBlueberry Bourbon Basil - a solid favorite. sweet, tart, and grown up.\\n\\nReal Maple & Bacon - sweet, salty, and a hint of amazing breakfast nostalgia in every bite.\\n\\nButtermilk Old Fashioned - classic flavor and superb texture.\\n\\nLemon Poppy Seed - tart, subtle, and delightful.\\n\\nChocolate Ganache - chocolate lovers, you're welcome. one bite is rich enough for me!\\n\\nPassion Fruit Cocoa Nib - fruit-forward, simply delicious.\\n\\nSalted Caramel - this is where you realize donuts are dessert, not exactly breakfast. \\n\\nPrices range from about $2.50-$3 for most donuts, a few specialities might come at a bit of extra cost.

At all.\\n\\nVancouver sucks for brunch options. There, I said it. However, for Vancouver brunch, this place definitely fills a void - except it reminds me of a shittier version of the Jam Cafe in Victoria - Medina is way overpriced, plus it has cramped seating, indifferent servers and a long wait that isn't really worth it IMO.\\n\\nI showed up here with my mom on the long weekend expecting a huge line but it was about 1:30 so I guess the rush had mostly passed by then. I walked up to the counter to ask about putting our names down for a table and was greeted with a scowl. Clearly the gal behind the counter was having a bad day and/or expected me to already know the drill. She directed me to write my name down on the clipboard by the door - so this is self service then? Not so awesome. Our wait was very short, only about ten minutes, which was great. We ended up being seated in the back by the wall and it was much quieter. The noise level in the front was VERY loud and would have pissed me off. I don't like having to yell at my dining companion, especially over brunch. It's not a nightclub.\\n\\nThe food was pretty decent - we both ordered waffles. I asked the server how many to order for a decent sized meal and she said two or three. We got two each and three would have been better. I ordered the milk chocolate lavender and salted caramel sauce. Both were delicious, if a bit too sweet. I also got a lavender latte and it held up to its reputation - delicious and not too sweet. My mom ordered the Medina Lemonade and it was really good too. I wasn't really impressed that the bill was over $30 for what basically amounted to a snack. Very overpriced for what you get. The service wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad either. I did feel like they were rushing us out of there once the room emptied out and the washrooms were kind of gross. It was the end of the day but still. \\n\\nI would probably try this place again but I wasn't as wowed by it as I had hoped to be. To sum it all up - Medina, you are overrated.

I had my burger medium (first time for me) and it comes with brisket, cole slaw, and barbecue sauce on top of the burger. I've had better brisket, yes, but the overall combination was phenomenal. The very description of the burger actually made my wife change her order to the RBQ as well!\\nThe sides were decent. I had the onion rings and ended up trading with my wife because she didn't like the fries, and I have to admit the onion rings were far better than the fries. This isn't a huge deal to me as the sides don't make or break a trip for me.\\nThe milkshakes were solid, both in the literal and metaphorical sense. I had the Nutella Burnt Marshmallow shake and my wife had the strawberry shortcake shake, both of which were thick and delicious. I was surprised when mine came out because it actually was topped with burnt marshmallows, which I enjoyed thoroughly once the shake was gone!\\nThe staff was very friendly while we were there. Our waitress made the recommendation of the burger I chose and told us it was the best burger there in her opinion, and I think she must have been right! She was very attentive throughout the meal and seemed genuinely happy that we enjoyed her recommendation. Another member of the staff came by to clear our plates and was also incredibly kind and took our milkshake order. \\nThe last big plus to this restaurant was the price. I walked out having spent the same amount as I would for going to Red Robin, but the quality of the food was far and away better than anything I've had in this price range. As I told my wife, I felt like we were robbing this restaurant blind at the prices they had! \\nThe one thing that takes away from my rating is the ambiance. While I'm fairly sure it was the ambiance the designer/owner is going for, I can't really see why you would want to yell at your date the entire time you're eating. The music was far too loud, which pushed up everyone's voice volume, which was amplified by the communal table environment. I enjoyed the communal table, though, as I was able to talk to the random guy next to me about his steak tartar burger.

Pork egg rolls were the star of our lunch, perfectly fried and served hot. No sweet and sour sauce but duck sauce worked. I think this was a lovely quick service option.

I have finally decided that I just don't like donuts unless it's rolling down the conveyor belt at Krispy Kreme when the Hot Light is on. So, take this review with a grain of salt, because clearly I have particular tastes when it comes to donuts. The hazelnut dulce de leche was a cake, and I don't mean a cake donut, I mean a cake. If you had taken a dulce de leche cake and cut it into a donut shape, that is what this was. It was overtly sweet and the texture was too cake-like and creamy and I needed water to wash it down because it just stuck in my throat. Hubby liked the Valrhona chocolate crunch, but then he loves Boston cream pie. Not my favorite. The Meyer lemon filled was just so-so and neither of us ate more than a bite of that. For me, the best donut was the Blueberry basil bourbon one because it was the only donut that had a traditional donut texture and I liked the blueberry flavor in the glaze.

There is the wonderful sea salt/leek thing going on and little bits of fresh delicate fish.  No overwhelming sauce or marinara to dip this in...just a little squeeze of lemon and it's fabulous.\\n\\nFianc√© ordered Linguine Lucy Johnson and I ordered Pollo Ripieno but asked if substituting the risotto of the day instead of polenta would be complimentary to the dish.  Our waiter intelligently responded that the restaurant was actually planning to amend this dish on the menu to make that specific change - because polenta is a bit heavy and they've found the risotto is a preferable compliment.  Ok then - risotto it is.  They are clearly putting some love and care into dishes in the kitchen bc we had a good amount of time to sit and \\"enjoy\\" the music (more on that later) while waiting on the main course.  Anticipation built as we saw lots of other delicious looking dishes arriving out our neighbors' tables.

The waiter quickly apologized when it was brought to his attention and offered to correct it, but the man didn't want to hold up the meal and have to wait for a 2nd dish.  The waiter comped his dish, and was politely apologetic.  In the end, I think the man liked this choice as well - perfect penne in a white wine sauce with fresh mozzarella,  prosciutto, and asparagus.  My chicken dish was delicious!  The chicken was excellently cooked, flavorful, tender, and stuffed with pecorino goat cheese.  I think there was supposed to be sun-dried tomato w the cheese, but I didn't really notice it (or miss it).  However, I think it would offer an interesting contrast in the dish.  The risotto was quite possibly one of the best things I've tasted in years.  The sauce with mushrooms (maybe a hint of marsala?) was also a wonderful compliment to the risotto and chicken.  My portion was HUGE.  The presentation wasn't exactly delicate - more like \\"homestyle\\", but tasted awesome.\\n\\nJust writing this review...I'm ready for a return trip less than a week later!!\\n\\nAn another note...the live music...well the best I can say it was interesting - if a bit distracting...we giggled throughout our meal at how off it seemed.

Hey, I can separate that song from Pulp Fiction...but play it on a Russian folk instrument in an Italian restaurant in a questionable part of town...wow instant Pulp Fiction.

Punjab Palace makes fantastic vegetarian dishes. My favorite thing to order is the Aloo Palak (spinach and potatoes over a bed of rice), medium spicy. And trust me, medium spicy is not for wimps! I also really really love the Vegetable Pakora appetizer (fried vegetable fritters) and the 2 sauces they give you to dip them in! SO GOOD. This place deserves the 4 stars for these 2 dishes alone. \\n\\nOn to the not so good. The naan is disappointing! I LOVE naan, so I was super disappointed when I ordered some from Punjab Palace and it just didn't taste right, maybe a little dry. booo. Also, their meat dishes are just not as good as their veggie dishes. Another yelper mentioned the quality of the meat isn't top notch, and I have to agree that when I ordered a chicken dish there it wasn't as tender as I had hoped. \\n\\nAlas, Punjab Palace still gets 4 stars from me, and will continue to be my favorite place to get Indian takeout.

The beef rib is insanely huge and could be split among 4 people (I ate a whole one myself once). Sausage is sausage. Expect to pay $20 to $25 a person if you are really indulging, more if you get a bunch of sides and deserts. Sides worth trying are mac n cheese and green beans.

At night, the lights of the carousel, Olympic torch and booths fill the area, giving you a true feel of a European Christmas. I always love to grab my cup of gluhwein and walk around to sample food and see the crafts available at various booths. This compares to an actual Xmas market in Europe. I went to a couple of these in Germany, and the Vancouver version offers a pretty authentic feel to the real deal; however, the snow is missing as well as the open feel (I.e. no gates in the actual European Xmas markets). Also, you'll find that the products and food are quite pricey here; I'm assuming this has something to do with the location and rent.

We came 2 nights in a row because after 1 dinner, there were still too many things on the menu that we had not tried. The first night we had the schnitzel and the veal 2 ways. The schnitzel melts in your mouth (I have not had a better one in Germany) and the veal was also cooked to perfection. All dishes are served with delicious and creative sides that are prepared with love and attention to detail.\\nThe second night we chose the tasting menu which was excellent.

Went a few weeks ago with a friend for his birthday on a Tuesday evening. The place was a ghost town. I had the steak Diane, which is prepared tableside. The dinner came with some vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. My friend had a fish dinner. Considering the ridiculously high prices, the service was terrible. Joanne, who I am told is the owner, was the server. She barely smiled and was almost nonexistent. Remember, there was only 1 other table occupied. We had to ask for bread. There were 2 of us - why would you bring out 3 slices of bread?...either 2, 4, or 6 slices would have been more appropos. This came with barely enough butter for the 3 slices. Then my friend requested lemon for his water. She literally brought out 1/2 slice of lemon - very thin. The food was good, but not worth the price. I had 2 margaritas with salt and my friend had one of their yummy desserts. The atmosphere is nice - very historic feeling with high ceilings. The final ridiculousness was they added the 19% gratuity claiming that was the restaurants's policy when using something like groupon. I've heard of adding the gratuity when there is a party of 6 or more - there were 2 of us. Stupid policy - if you don't want to accept groupon, then don't sign on. It's insulting to the customer.

Food, service (thanks Jenn) and atmosphere are all on point. \\n\\nSome of my favorite items:\\n\\n* Cheeky Monkey - This is the most delicious version of a Scotch Egg that I've ever encountered. There are hash browns, housemade sausage and aged cheddar bits mixed into the coating on the perfectly cooked egg (yes, still gooey in the middle). Sage and sausage amp up the flavor of the gravy too. Did I mention this is also gluten free?! \\n\\n* Pimento Omelette- I am addicted to cheese. I have literally opted for it in place of a birthday cake on more than one birthday. If this resonates with you at all, order this with a side of the Hatch Chili Hollandaise. You'll thank me later. This also comes with their Hashbrown Casserole, which will make you sigh next time you're served normal hashbrowns with your eggs. \\n\\n* South First Tots- I have done the research on tots around town. This is an incredibly generous iteration. Each of the ingredients hits each and every part of your palette, so every bite is a flavor bomb.

Don't get me wrong this place has a nice atmosphere, but they really need to work on the food portions. Eighteen dollars for lamb is a bit steep considering the fact that it's maybe 7 or 8 small cubes of it. The veggies looked like they were all cooked together with my other friends orders which is fine, but then one mostly got onions. My other friend mostly had bell peppers and I had maybe 4 pieces of veggies. Lol!!! Really?! The pita bread came out extremely late and most of us were done eating by then. The only thing I can say that was pretty good was the yogurt sauce and the hummus. The hummus can really stand out on its own with a side on bread. Now let's talk about the service. After I received my dish no one really checked up on us. We pretty much had to wave them down to get bread. I even saw one of the waiters scratch his berries if you know what I mean while he was giving us our food. Seriously no joke!!! That's pretty gross on any level!!!

L-O-N-G careers. . . Then looking around, it becomes apparent that it's not just the waitresses - my sister is 60 and she feels young in this place.  \\n\\nWe took our seats (which reminded me of furniture that was already old in the 1980's), and our friendly waitress greeted us.  A lot.  Drinks came quickly and we trudged through the innumerable lunch specials and regular menu items.  There are salads, burgers, sandwiches, and traditional meat entrees.  They offer Cincinnati chili, but my wife is from Cincinnati and I'm not even tempted to chance it.  Being on a cholesterol watch, I got the bison burger and baked potato.  My sister got the strawberry chicken salad.  The waitress was quite attentive to my desire to avoid butter on the potato, and was helpful with some alternate suggestions.\\n\\nMy sister's salad came out - it was huge, and looked pretty enticing.  My burger came out cooked medium well, as it was ordered.  It came with some nice-looking garnish,  a big yellow bun, and my potato, which was salted on the outside.\\n\\nMy sister seemed pleased with her dish.  I, on the other hand, had some concerns.  I fully appreciate that bison is not beef, so it was appropriately dry, not juicy like Wendy's.  The only thing I think is fair to criticize is that it was a little TOO perfectly round - I suspect that it was purchased frozen into that shape.  The bun was a bit too thick (and I'm not squeamish about a lot of bread), dry, and harder than the cheap burger buns from the grocery store.  The worst part was the potato.  It was so covered with black spots that I had a big pile of inedible matter on the edge of my plate.  I understand that baking potatoes to order is not practical, so I can be forgiving.  So, I could overlook the dried out skin.  What I could not overlook was that part of the potato was not cooked.\\n\\nI am all about locally owned, one-of-a-kind restaurants.  I appreciate the overly chummy, career waitresses in miniskirts.  And for some reason, I get some comfort out of the fact that the place appears to be overrun with regulars.  I don't even mind that the menu could benefit from an update.  I just could not abide the poor quality bun and potato, or the undercooking of the potato.

As a matter of fact, they have menus for vegan, nut allergies, and gluten allergies, which is great for anyone who has food restrictions.\\n\\nThe beef and broccoli was good, but it was totally different take on any version I've had before. It was strips of bone in beef and chinese broccoli with a delicious sauce that we had to order more of since it was so good. The surf and turf was good. It had a mild spice and since I am a chili head, I ordered dragon sauce which added a bit of a kick to it. You can also tell the noodles are homemade. I could have literally eaten a plain bowl of noodles. The postickers were huge and filled with plenty of pork. I definitely would like to try the other options.

I had a kiwi cocktail with midori.  It was sweet and delicious.  My husband had a pink Himalayan cocktail with grapefruit and gin.

He said it was very good, though not the best duck he ever had.  I had the chicken tikka masala.  The portion was large and it was good, but it was not chicken tikka masala, or if it was then it was the strangest tikka masala I ever had.  It was more like chicken curry.  It had a gravy with a strong curry flavor and it was not creamy in any way.  So it was good chicken curry, terrible tikka masala.  It was also a nice medium spice level and more spice than I would expect from a restaurant on Disney property.   \\nOn previous occasions I have enjoyed the Honey chicken which reminds me of the honey chicken available at Nine Dragons in Epcot or a similar version available at Pei Wei/ PF Changs.     \\nFor dessert we had the fried cream cheese wontons with strawberries, pineapples, honey, and ice cream.

I advise any one who has not eaten here before to please get there early before they open. I believe they open at 11am. Get there at 1030am. Their might be a few other people ahead of you but you will get in fast, get a good seat and get first dibs on the buffet. This place gets packed quick! My brother in law and I got there and were one of the first on line. We were the first ones at the buffet. By the time we sat down and looked around the place was PACKED!!! i kid you not. Also, save room for dessert. Their cream puffs are huge and delicious. I would advise not eating too much before going there. You will probably hit the buffet two to three times.

It was good, but not great-despite the high quality of the pork and meaty texture. The dan dan noodles. I love dan dan noodles. I understand it is a fusion thing, but the noodles lacked chew and the wild boar sauce was SO salty. The ration of noodle to meat was off, as well. There was still at least a half cup of meat after the noodles were depleted. Green rice-well, it was salty and odd. This was not some \\"inspired\\" combination. The pomegranate seeds added very little and it was oddly garnished. The bok choy was something I ordered to cut through the salt. Holy moly, that was salted too with the pieces of salted veg in for flavor. The roof of my mouth is cut up like a ate a Red Baron pizza and washed it down with a box of captain crunch!

Complete with vintage furniture, some striking art, and even bongo-drums, the rooms here are impressive. Certainly this place attracts the bookwormish out from their Otterbein dorm-pits.\\n\\nThe art adorned rooms are in the back. The front is standard mom-and-pop cafe, wooden tables and booths.

The old appliances and stain floors clash with the remainder of the place. The help could use a smile as well; my barista looked like a Dickens character--an orphan gone without gruel-- her frowning disposition was not welcoming. Though if she's one of the artist with an exhibit in the barista art room, all is forgiven. \\n\\nJava Central strength lies in it environment, not in its coffee. I had a mocha and it was standard. It's no secret that I love good interior design, original art work, and bongo drums--but the coffee has to match.

With the fries I got a side of ranch, ketchup and the chipotle ketchup. I like a variety of sauces. The ranch tasted odd, ketchup was good, and the chipotle ketchup was delicious. The Diablo burger with a sunny side up egg was pretty tasty. I ordered it because the order taker/cashier said it was the most popular after I asked him. It really is NOT spicy and to me that's a great thing because I'm not a fan of a string spicy presence. I'll compare the spice level (not taste) to extremely mild buffalo sauce. The Kennebec fries tasted fresh and were well done. They were average in terms of taste. The soda fountain options were not Pepsi or Coca Cola products and I think they might be local or made in house. Not 100% sure. They do have Coca-Cola products (American plastic bottled and Mexican glass bottled) at the register were you place your order. They also have wine and other alcoholic beverages. \\n\\nVibe=4 Stars: Awesome downtown location with a parking garage literally behind the joint. Cool bar area and I liked that the tables have a paper towel roll so guests don't have to ask for more napkins. The bar has a lot of options and has a very cool setup. You can definitely relax here. This place is like a fast food joint and a casual sit down restaurant with waiter service mixed in one. \\n\\nService=2 Stars: When I walked in I was supposed to be greeted by a hostess (I didn't know) so she can give me a table number before I walked up to make my order. No one came to me, nor did I see anyone that made it obvious they were a host/hostess. The cashier was kind enough to assign me a table after he asked what my table number was and I told him I didn't get one. Based on the look he made, I thought he was going to send me back. The waiters walking around the restaurant were not friendly and didn't even offer help when I was looking around for the soda fountain when I clearly looked like I was looking for something. One waiter even cut right through me as I was walking to the dining room like if we were in Times Square, NYC. As I sat down at my table, the waiter came over and greeted me. He was kind and asked if he could get me something. I asked for ranch and a few minutes later I saw him cleaning a table. He forgot about my ranch. Minutes after my food came out I reminded him and he got my ranch but he first had to clear a table near me! Why would he do this if he forgot about it once already?! I think people were avoiding me here lol. A manager walked around and said hi to the table in front and to the one on my right but didn't bother to say anything to me.

Additionally, you can customize your laffa (which ends up being a big ole happy Mediterranean burrito by the time you're done) with loads of fresh accoutrements. Hummus, check. Baba ghanoush, check. Other pickles, veggies, sauces, and slathers will fortify your selection and elevate your laffa to near perfection.\\n\\nThe setup is very much like a chain burrito restaurant, wherein choices are offered as you scoot down the make line with your eyes fixed on your food.

I don't feel like paying over $14 on a dish I might throw in the garbage anymore"},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I came here for Dine Out on Friday because 1) I've been meaning to try it for awhile and 2) they had an interesting Dine Out menu compared to everywhere else: between 2 people, you can choose one starter, one salad, one curry and one stir fry to share family-style, then a dessert each. Menu was $28 pp. Note that for Dine Out, you're advised of your 1.5hr seating allowance.\\n\\nStarter - Thai Mussels with Lemongrass and Thai Basil 5/5:\\n\\nThe most tender mussels I've ever had! These little morsels melted in our mouths, and were served in a beautifully delicate lemongrass broth with chunks of tomato and basil, plus a hint of fish sauce. My date and I were practically drinking the broth when the mussels were gone! They brought a little saucer of nahm jim dipping sauce to accompany the mussels, but IMO the spiciness of the sauce was overpowering to the delicate briny-ness of the mussels.\\n\\nSalad - House Smoked Keta Salmon Salad 3.5/5:\\n\\nWe were debating over which salad to choose, but settled for this intriquing-sounding salmon salad. The first bite was an explosion of flavours. If tastebuds had faces, they would've been punched in them! Despite the unusual inclusion of smoked salmon, the flavours were wholly Thai: lime, peanut, coconut, spice. The mark of excellent Asian food is the proper balance of sweet, sour, spicy and salty. Although it was tasty, about halfway through the dish the sour and salty became a little overwhelming. Pomelo in this dish made an interesting texture contrast to the salmon.\\n\\nCurry - Burmese Curry with Sloping Hills Pork 4.5/5:\\n\\nMy first impression of this dish was the complexity of its flavours. The spices must have been toasted, because there was a pleasant smoky complexity that combined well with the sweet, salty and sour flavours. Not very spicy, so it's perfect for spice-adverse diners. The meat was pork belly and shoulder so it was incredibly fatty! That's where the yumminess comes from though, so can't really complain. No one's forcing you to eat the chunks of fat. Served with rice on the side.\\n\\nStir-Fry - Halibut Cheeks with Sator 2/5:\\n\\nDisappointingly bland and overcooked. We chose halibut cheeks because they're normally such tender parts of the fish. Here, they were dry and unappetizing. Not sure what \\"sator\\" is, but it didn't make these halibut cheeks appetizing. We didn't finish this dish.\\n\\nDessert - Maenam's Nam Tang Sai 5/5:\\n\\nFor their Dine Out menu, each diner is allowed to pick their own individual dessert; we just happened to choose the same thing. Maenam describes this dessert as \\"our version of the popular street side dessert. shaved coconut sorbet, candied thai fruit, jasmine perfumed pandanus syrup\\". I'm a sucker for anything coconut, so this was a no brainer for me! The candied thai fruit was a mixture of coconut meat, longan and mango that seemed to be marinated in said jasmine pandanus syrup. Delicious, sweet and refreshing. I can see this being a perfect summertime dessert to cool off after a heavy dinner.\\n\\nService 3.5/5:\\n\\nWe had reservations for 8pm on a Friday, but didn't actually get seated until 8:15. We had to wait outside because it was so crowded inside. However, upon sitting down, a complimentary amuse bouche of house-made Thai sausage was promptly brought to our table. Our server was polite but seemed very keen to get our orders in. Maybe because he didn't want our reservation to run into the next reservation's time? Still, it seemed excessive for him to check our table four times to see if we were ready to order. It turned into a bit of a \\"hurry up and wait\\" situation because when we were finished our dinner and waiting for dessert, no one came to clear our table for a good 20min.\\n\\nI will definitely come back once Dine Out is done.

The clams were okay - not memorable but not problematic.  The sides were also okay but not memorable.  Two of the oysters tasted slightly \\"off,\\" and varieties available were limited and of only average reputation.  The chowders are a wee bit thin and oversalted but have a reasonably good mix of ingredients and tasted pretty good.  The lobster was shameful, esp. at $60. -- seemed like they'd taken an already- steamed lobster from yesterday, chilled or frozen it overnight, and put it briefly on a inadequately hot grill (or oven?) not entirely up to the job.  Though hot, it was nearly tasteless, and the large meat was tough, dry, and difficult to pull from the shell, while the legs had lost all meat (dried and stuck to shell) and the unnecessary stuffing was stale and tasteless.  We'd had smoked-grilled lobster elsewhere that remained moist and had lovely smoke/wood flavor; this had no wood or grilled flavor at all.    \\n\\nThe service was very attentive but the allotted utensils were just not up to the job -- nutcrackers are supplied as if they'd do the same job as actual lobster crackers.  But nutcrackers are too small and lacking in the special big-middle ridge to crack the large pieces.

No lobster picks were provided either -- usually come with lobster crackers as part of the deal.  The server found some skewers to substitute for the picks, which was resourceful and helpful.  But there is little chance we'll be back.

This place was ridiculously good! We didn't have much time in Austin, but multiple people told us to either go to Salt Lick or Terry Black's.  Not being adventurous enough to take a detour to Salt Lick made us decide to go to Terry Black's instead.  This place is located off Barton Springs Road, has a large sign outside, and a parking lot that is PACKED.  You should be able to find a sign though.  They have indoor and outdoor seating and it is cafeteria style.  You grab a tray when you go inside and scoop up your sides into small dishes.  They had creamed corn, coleslaw, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, green beans, etc.  They also had peach cobbler!  Once you grab your sides, you move on to the meat cutting station.  On the sign outside the door, they said what they had left for meat at that point in the day.  If you come later in the day, they can run out of some meats.  I got pork ribs and sausage, while my boyfriend got beef brisket and beef ribs and we shared everything.  You pay and then proceed to GRUB!  \\n\\nYou can grab bread, hot sauce and pickles and onions on a station to the side.  You can choose a table inside or outside, and grab some of their sauces.  I thought that the beef brisket and ribs were PHENOMENAL.  Pork ribs were okay, and sausage was good.  I would definitely recommend the beef brisket and ribs though.  Both the ribs and brisket were super juicy.  The rib meat was falling off the bone.  It didn't even need any sauce, but I liked the original sauce.  Sides were also delicious!  Peach cobbler was a perfect dessert to end a fantastic meal.  I personally thought that Terry Black's had better BBQ than Salt Lick in Driftwood.  They really should be applauded for what they are doing here!  One of the employees even gave us a short tour of the smokers and explained the process of smoking the meats here.  They put a lot of dedication and care into their smoking process!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Mash every item on the menu into my face hole, please.\\n\\nThey've got this brie covered burger and these cheese fries and these fresh to death salads and these frozen margaritas with a Corona stuck in it and yes, this place is awesome.\\n\\nThe big downer is the line, as everyone wants in on this place.

The person taking the order forgot to ask how he likes his burger cooked (and he forgot to mention it b/c we were fainting with hunger after having skipped breakfast and waited in line for so long), and they defaulted to medium rare, which he hates.  Not cool.  He said what he did eat of it wasn't that flavorful, either.  The salad was nice enough.  The toppings on the veggie burger were good, but the veggie patty was gross- a huge pile of soggy rice and something orange that was either carrots or cheese.  I guess some people like fake burgers like that, but I'll take 24 Diner's lentil/beet/pepito patty any day of the week over such lame attempts as that one.  The horseradish mustard was not in the least bit spicy or flavorful.  Maybe they just didn't put enough on it?  Maybe it was forgotten?  Maybe the person who took our order erased all condiments when I said I didn't want mayo? Who knows?  At least the avocado was good. All in all, we will definitely not be going back.

Granted, I don't live in Portland, so I am comparing Navarre to SF restaurants.\\n\\nWe went on a Thursday at about 6:45pm and had no trouble getting a table.

We ordered everything except for the French Cheeses off of the daily menu.  There only seemed to be one waitress for the entire restaurant and the food took a while to come out, and it came pretty much all at once.  We were hungry, which probably made the wait seem longer.  I'm not sure why they didn't bring our cheese order out first, since it doesn't involve cooking.  :)  That was my only complaint.  I asked for a recommendation from the waitress on our wine and was happy with what she suggested.  They also serve half carafes...excellent!\\n\\nWe ordered the brussel sprouts with apples - the apples were baked and I think the brussel sprouts were roasted (delicious), the trout - it had a sauce I can't remember the name of with capers in it (i don't usually order trout, but this was cooked perfectly), the crab cakes - all crab, no filler served with jam (so delicious, i love crab cakes), winter squash with mint and garlic (possibly the best preparation of squash i've ever had), chanterelle mushrooms with fennel (good).

I'll get the negative out of the way first before I praise them.  I went with a large group (11), and they sat us 45 minutes after our reservation.  Strike one.  Then we sat down, and it took probably about 15 minutes before they came and tended to us.  We were STARVING.  Strike two.  Then, they sort of have an attitude here that you're supposed to share your food with your party, especially with a big group, so even though people ordered their own stuff, they would come by and just put the food anywhere on the table, and we'd have to shuffle it to whoever ordered it.  This became a problem when one person started eating a dish that wasn't theirs, and the original person who ordered it was left wondering where his dish was.  After we realized what had happened, they asked this person if he wanted to just eat what the other person had ordered or if he wanted to another of his original dish.  He did the latter, and they ended up charging us for both orders.  Not exactly their fault, but not very cool.  Strike three.  And then, to top it all off, they included the tip on the bill, which is fine because it was a big group, but they charged us TWICE the tip they should have!  We were left wondering why we were so short on money after everyone paid, until someone realized the tip amount didn't look right.  Strike four.  (Yeah, I know there's only 3 strikes in baseball.  =P)  They corrected the tip mistake, but didn't offer anything to make up for the many service blunders we had experienced that night.  Some people were pretty pissed and gave the night a thumbs down because of the service, but I was so pleased with everything else, that I was willing to overlook it.\\n\\nSo now on to the good stuff.  First of all, this place is not a Chinese restaurant and it doesn't try to be.  I would call it Chinese-influenced food (I guess Asian Fusion works).  In other words, YUM!  I got to try a few things, but my favorite was the sweet potato fritters.  Check this out, imagine a sweet potato patty, with Chinese sausage mixed in, fry it (of course), and top it with a curry and sriracha sauce.  DELICIOUS!  My main dish was curry crab legs, which apparently aren't on the menu anymore because they're not on the online menu.  They were also very tasty.\\n\\nI also love the vibe of this place.  The restaurant is shaped like an L, with the bar along one of the walls and the kitchen along another wall.  I'm a huge fan of open kitchens!  The crowd is kinda trendy, kinda funky.  I got a big kick out of the fact that they play with the idea that they're Chinese-inspired.  They have a lot of fake Chinese proverbs and quotes written on the walls, and they use pages of Chinese newspapers as place mats.  My favorite quote was written on the mirror in the men's bathroom, but I'm not going to spoil it by writing it here.  =)\\n\\nAnd I think I saw Joanne Chang, which was pretty exciting."},{"name":"Nick's Bistro","address":"169 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"3.5","text":"This is one of the better sub shops in the area.

Definitely a wait anytime I have been around the area - as it was the day I went - and I personally can't understand why. The food was fine, but not something I would call \\"world famous\\" or worthy of a long wait, Took a bit to get attention from the server when we needed drink refills, etc. Food was filling and price seemed reasonable for the quantity.

Why did I not think about that? All I've heard in my head for days is \\"magic shroom,\\" but not for weird reasons, I just really wanted a mushroom goat cheese burger. And damnit I had to have it!\\n\\nSo walking in and seeing that dizzying long line going straight from the door to the cashier was more than a disappointment. I really think the entire population of Austin was at Hopdoddy last night. But me and my equally famished friends decided that we might as well wait, and sure enough, managed to eyeball everyone's plate and devise the BEST dinner plan. So here it is:\\n\\n1/2 Magic Shroom\\n1/2 Larry's spinach salad\\n1/2 Dark chocolate milkshake\\n1/4 fries\\n\\nYes, that's what I ate last night, and it was perfect. A large serving of fries can feed 4. They're seasoned with pepper and spices and if you dip it in their chipotle ketchup sauce, you'll think you're in heaven. The Magic Shroom is strong. The goat cheese is kind of overwhelming but if you really like goat cheese (I do!) you won't be complaining. I really liked the buns too, nice and toasty. The milkshake is not as thick as I would have liked but it was still super satisfying. And the salad was a little heavy on the bleu cheese but I'm glad I got some greens to balance out my otherwise totally unhealthy meal.\\n\\nI love the aesthetics of Hopdoddy, too. It's clean and upscale, a good twist on the diner feel.\\n\\nIf only I did not hate waiting for food."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I know a lot of people who are from Germany or who have visited Germany.  Which of course means I also know a lot of people who love to point out how inaccurate \\"German\\" things here in the states are.  They say Schmidt's is nothing like actual German food.  They hate on Oktoberfest at the fairgrounds, because \\"It's nothing like M√ºnchen!\\"  \\n\\nThese people are major buzzkills.\\n\\nLet's put all the cards on the table-- Schmidt's is as authentically German as I am.  Which is to say, at one point long long ago my family came from there, but we're pretty thoroughly Americanized. But rather than judging Schmidt's on how authentic their sausage is or how historically correct the servers' dirndls are, just roll with it.  You'll enjoy yourself a lot more!\\n\\nHoused in a historic brick building in German Village, Schmidts' decor tends toward a cliche-Deutsch-y style.  It's campy, it's fun, and when I went, there was an accordion band playing.  Again, just roll with it. \\n\\nOn our visit, we got the \\"Famous Pretzel Nuggets\\" appetizer, which were way better than your typical soft pretzels.  They tasted like they had been deep fried-- the outsides were crispy, the insides were soft, and the dough was slightly sweet.  There was a tangy mustard dipping sauce that came with them.  Give me a pair of stretchy pants, a cold beer, and hide me from judging eyes, and I could eat a whole basket of these on my own, no joke.  \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the Hoffbrau Schnitzel, and received a plate of lightly breaded and fried pork loin, with a tasty brown gravy.  On the side I got potato pancakes and apple sauce (which were awesome like potato cakes generally are, but nothing too special) and sweet kraut (which I could eat all day long). My husband got the sausage sampler, which came with four different half-sausages.  Overall, the food was nicely flavored and I felt like the portion size was quite generous.\\n\\nFor dessert, order the cream puff.  It's the stuff of Columbus legend.  Light, tender pastry filled with not-too-sweet cream.  Delicious!  Not authentically German... but once more, just roll with it. \\n\\nYou can be the kind of person who looks for the authentic German experience in Columbus, deriding anything that doesn't come close to the ideal you have in your head.  Or you can be the kind of person who eats their Bahama Mama and enjoys the experience for what it is.  If you're that kind of person, you'll really enjoy Schmidt's."},{"name":"Gusto Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great meal! Great service!

Chez Vincent on one side, and Hannibal's on the other - same food, same restaurant, just two different names. We walked in through the \\"Chez\\" side. None of the servers looked up although we attempted to get their attention, \\"Perhaps the entrance is on the other side.\\" We walked over to the Hannibal's side. The place had a handful of patrons dining at their tables, and another handful at the bar.

We informed him that we had a reservation and he said, as he pointed, \\"pick a table - we have two here, and one in the back.\\" We were surprised that he simply pointed to the tables and left us to choose one - even more so that a restaurant of this caliber, and price-tag, would not walk their customers to a table, pull out the chair, ask if that table is ok... you know, the normal thing that a ma√Ætre d' normally does. \\n\\nWe chose the table furthest to the back of the room... and patiently waited for about 10 minutes... no one came to the table... no one said, \\"someone will be right with you...\\", nothing...

Not complaining, though, since it just got real excitingly convenient for me. Located on the outside of Perimeter Mall, it's a quick hop and a skip away from my place. \\n\\nThe new location is pretty big and roomy. It has somewhat of a different vibe from the Buckhead location or any location in NYC. I came here to meet with a few girls from my small group for dinner. You order right at the entrance: the line to order is a bit crowded and small - quite possibly not worth it. However, there wasn't much of a line on a weeknight, for whatever reason. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken shack with a 16oz Shackmeister beer. The chicken shack was juicy and quite picturesque. The beer was satisfying, as usual, and a good serving size for a good price. I enjoyed both, as the beer helped washed down the fried chicken. I mean, c'mon, fried chicken and beer is a classic. \\n\\nI really had no complaints. Food came out in a mostly timely fashion, or maybe because we were able to occupy each other's time with conversation.

Desta Ethiopian Kitchen is located just south of the Clairmont Road I-85 exit at the corner of Briarcliff Road.  You can eat family style, sharing a huge platter of food with your family or friends, or grab an individual order.  There's even a wait on a Wednesday evening at 9 PM.\\n\\nHighlights: My group ordered the Meat Lovers, which is a giant platter of three meats of your choice along with two vegetable sides and injera (the soft bread served with Ethiopian food).  We weren't sure if that would be enough, so we also ordered the vegetarian platter.  Splitting between four people, that was definitely more than enough food.  Our meat choices were the lamb, the salmon, and the filet mignon.  Everything was moist.  Everything was well seasoned.  In summary, everything was delicious.  The lamb had a very slight hint of gaminess, but it wasn't off-putting.  Each meat was blended with a mix of appropriately chosen sauteed vegetables.  The injera was soft, not too sour, and was replenished promptly upon request.  As for the vegetables, they were also well seasoned.  Presentation was great - the plate was colorful.  Make sure to eat all of the injera sitting underneath the food as well - it's amazing after it soaks up all of the juices of the meat and the flavors of everything on the plate.\\n\\nCritiques:  I can only criticize myself for not trying this restaurant earlier - this is the best Ethiopian food that I've eaten to date.\\n\\nOverall: One of the best places to eat family style that I've been to in Atlanta.

Weekends are especially popular, more so than on a m-f so be prepared for a bit of a wait. We put our name down at 9:30 am, and were seated by 10:30 (give or take ten minutes).  They do not have a texting waiting service here (or maybe it just wasn't being used) but regardless, we walked around downtown a bit before making our way back to Medina.\\n\\nThe host is organized and cordial even with all the guests who crowd inside by the door. It is recommended that you wait outside and form a line along the restaurant windows.  Surely, while you wait to be seated, you can also browse Yelp ;) and read the reviews and look at the menu items, or even ask for a menu so that you can be ready to decide what to order. \\n\\nThere is a generous variety here, starting with latte flavours (try the salted caramel! I have had the lavender latte a handful of times but wow salted caramel is YUMMy and was kindly suggested by our awesome server with the cool purple/grey hair) and in addition to your caffeine section, I noticed a KOMBUCHA section (woah is it picking up in popularity?).  There was a variety of food options to choose from, but it was not overwhelming. \\n\\nWe were trying to choose two big items, and I love that our server was kind enough to give gentle suggestions, which totally helps when you are unsure and do not want to miss out on trying something that you will regret not having tried. We ordered an avocado toast (yum and the focaccia was soft and fresh!), a Harissa \\"Burger\\" they quoted the word burger on their menu because it is more like a pita and the patty is inside of it, and thirdly Les Boulettes.  (Bonus: as a girl who loves to hydrate on H20, this business does a great job of leaving a bottle at your table to pour into your neato pretty gold/stainless steel? cups).  \\n\\nLastly, but not leastly (hehe) we ordered a white chocolate rosewater pistachio waffle. I did not regret it at all! For anyone who loves baklava, this waffle is like a decomposed baklava (ingredients wise) on a freshly made, toasty yet gently crisped and soft on the inside waffle, dusted with a good snowing of powdered sugar. As I write this, I feel bad for those with a nut/gluten/sugar allergy, but for the rest of us, this flavour is a big win. I want to go back right now to have that flavour. I want Medina to have a portable food truck close to my workplace so I can snack on this deliciousness. Can Medina read this and invent a waffle food truck just for me?

To begin with, the salad dressing was a little thin, but still pretty good; lettuce and vegs were fresh. But then came the gyro special. The tzatziki sauce was very watery and had no taste. The gyro was meat was pretty good given that it was pan fried and a little crispy. But the bread was either stale and toasted or just toasted to death to the point of seeming stale. It was hard and had a greasy coating. The accompanying tomatoes were mushy and the onions were tough and obviously from the outer layers that should've been trashed. Even the potatoes, usually very moist on the inside but slightly crispy on the outside, covered with a light delicious oregano lemony flavor were bland, mushy and unappetizing. All in all, very disappointing. I've loved this place for years but held back for a while to give the owners a chance to 'settle in.' But I'm afraid I won't be back after this.

The only hesitation I have was that the skin wasn't crunchy. I like really crispy chicken; however, the chicken was not soggy at all.

No suggestions, no hospitality, minimum terse interaction just to get an order placed.  \\n\\nThen there's the prices.  I am happy to pay for great food and service.  Gigi's was ordinary, overpriced food.  Chopped basil does not elevate every dish Gigi.  \\n\\nHere are a few free tips from \\"Pete's handbook of hospitality, the key to great service, great reputation and repeat customers.\\"\\n\\nTry being courteous and consultative - even just a little bit.  You have every tool and ingredient to make pretty much whatever anyone wants.  When patrons are trying to decide, talk to them.  Indicate that you're happy to \\"customize this\\" or \\"toast that\\".  Suggest that you can put together a cheese sandwich for the kids no problem, or make some noodles with butter when your patrons are asking questions.  The point is, you've got us in the door (and that's the hard part) now do something with it.  Instead we got inhospitable staff who agonized over how they were going to toast the bread on one of the sandwiches.  \\n\\nHave some recommendations for kids.  I get that you think you're going to be known for $16 gourmet sandwiches which might be fine for me, but if I can't bring my kids there and place a simple order for them then why would I return?  At Gigi's you have to try to Frankenstein something together for kids, with no recommendation from the staff.  Ok so we paid $9 for a small portion of plain pasta with butter for one of the kids.  The other two kids got cheese sandwiches with no meat and were still charged gourmet sandwich pricing.  Huh?\\n\\nIf you're going to charge me $12 for a BOBBY ROSSETTI that claims \\"Buttermilk chicken cutlet, cornflake crust, mozzarella, house pomodoro, roasted red peppers\\" then do it right.  My chicken cutlets were dry and didn't seem to be crusted with buttermilk and cornflake.  I didn't get roasted red peppers I got saut√©ed orange and red bell peppers which are nothing like roasted peppers.   \\n\\nThere were five of us.  All five felt let down by the ordering process.  (No recommendations, no suggestions, just say what's on the menu and alterations will be accepted begrudgingly if at all.) \\n\\nWe were all let down by the food too.  It took a very long time, was expensive, was ordinary food.  \\n\\nLooks like they might be closing down.  All merch was 50% off and the place was empty...  wouldn't surprise me!\\n\\nFarewell Gigi's!

Not bad but it leaves something to be desired.\\n- Butcher's Cut: A little too strong on the bleu cheese but otherwise a fantastic burger. The meat was soft enough to melt the moment it touched my tongue and the vinaigrette, jam and veggies made for an interesting taste medley in my mouth.\\n- Farmer: Pretty much a standard burger but the apple chutney gives it a nice sweet tang that you should enjoy.\\n- rBQ: Standard BBQ fare on a burger. I was a little disappointed by the quality, considering that we were in the South, but I had to remember we were here for burgers, not BBQ.\\n- Fry side sampler: Fries were average, nothing to write home about. The sweet potato tots had me hooked, even though I actually don't like sweet potatoes. Something about tater tots... And the onion rings had a very lightly fried batter that paired perfectly with the juicy onion inside.\\n- Nutella+Burnt Marshmallow: This is why I love Chef Blais.

I actually went 2 times in the first 2 days it opened and it would have been more if I had no conscience for my health.

We brought our kids and they loved it too since they can handle spicy stuff.  \\n\\nThe sides definitely leave something to be desired, although the slaw does a good job of balancing out the kick in the chicken.  Another warning: if you want extra bread, they charge $0.15 per slice for any extra, which is unnecessary when it's just plain, cheap white bread (not even homemade).\\n\\nThat being said, I'm planning to eat just the fried chicken and tenders every time I come and simply enjoy.

I have not tried their pho yet, which I understand is very good. I didn't specifically go to Pho Van for the banh mi but was there for lunch, so decided to try it. I think the vegetables (cilantro, pickled carrots and daikon, jalape√±o) are what makes banh mi unique and tasty. The meat is important but kind of a second player. For my taste, the grilled pork banh mi at Pho Van had too much meat on it and it was a bit too seasoned. It really overwhelmed the sandwich. The bread was also not great. It was just kind of a sub roll, not very toasted on the outside. It was a decent sandwich but not a great banh mi.

I had made an error with my reservation but luckily, they were able to accommodate us, albeit at two adjacent tables.  The reservation snafu was my fault so I was just relieved that they were able to help us out.\\n\\nService was good; it was busy so our server wasn't able to check in on us as often as I would have liked but that's understandable.  I had the pesto chicken quesadilla.  It was rather tasty; I enjoyed the contrast of the dried cranberries to the chicken and pesto.  I also tried the tuna tataki (yum!).  I believe something may have been spilled at our other table but our server graciously comped us for item in question.\\n\\nOne thing of note is the women's washroom.  I normally don't include the washroom in my reviews, but this one was huge with a sitting area on one side and a large open area in the middle.  It only had 4 stalls, but I swear that this washroom is bigger than most bachelor apartments downtown.  I wonder if it was designed with those women who go to the washroom in groups in mind.  Also, the toilets don't have a motion sensor flush, or even a conventional manual flush.  Nope, their toilets have an \\"Exotic Foot Flush\\" (no joke, that's what the sign inside the stall said).\\n\\nMy only gripe is the price.  It's what stops me from giving this place more than 3 stars.  Like others have also mentioned, I guess Cactus Club thinks that having Rob Feenie as their chain's executive chef justifies their prices.  I suppose they have come a long way; from \\"family fun restaurant\\" to upscale casual eatery.  Am I the only one who remembers back when they were a family restaurant with a cow mascot?

I've never had poorer customer service and I've stayed at Days Inn a variety of places.  I arrived on Saturday, Christmas Eve, bringing my mom as her gift, my 66 year old mother with a bad hip.  Their elevator broke the night we got there but thank goodness we'd taken our bags up...to the 8th! floor...already.  We had also fully unpacked.  I even brought a little Christmas tree and put all our presents out, clothes in the drawers and closets, and sundries out.\\n\\nWhen I asked what time the elevator would be fixed, remember it's Saturday...they said Wednesday!!!  Are you kidding? They said they had to wait until their elevator people were back from vacation?!  Seriously!  Um, there are emergency services for these kinds of things.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I think they didn't want to pay the type of extra fees/overtime it would've cost.\\n\\nThen, I talked to a supervisor who said she'd talk to the manager about returning my points for this stay (which she must've never did as I had to re-ask staff upon departure).  She also said she \\"would have\\" offered us breakfast daily but their restaurant was closed under renovations or something.  Well when I checked out I expected all my points returned but since she hadn't talked to the GM about what we discussed I had to talk to the current staff, who then talked to the GM.  Apparently the GM thought one night covered the ridiculousness.  This is unacceptable!!\\n\\nHow unacceptable you ask - their own staff didn't want to walk up the 8 flights on one occasion.  Case in point - I lost a hand-made crocheted Christmas beanie from my mom :( so I called down to the front desk - they told me to go knock on housekeeping's door and ask them - um, excuse me?!!!  I'm calling you, that is your responsibility, it's your job, uh - what the heck.  Ooooh, I know why - house keeping was on the 8th floor they said.  So they don't want to walk up the 8 floors once - which is their job if something is requested - yet I have to do so multiple times daily?  That was not my understanding when I specifically booked this place because they had an elevator for my mom.  I felt so bad as she had so much trouble.  Then trying to get our bags down?  I can't even go there.  I'm so mad still and will again ask that the Days Inn refund my entire stay.  I'm also telling Wyndam, their hotel group as I used points since I've earned them staying at other Days Inn with good customer service, and hopefully they will do something about this.\\n\\nI mean I was offered \\"my points back\\" and daily free breakfast...again if their restaurant had been open.  So I'd like to say don't expect the GM to do much for you...I didn't even get a face to face or actually, now that I think of it...a real apology.  Don't stay here if you want real customer service (i.e., people who care about what you're going through when things go a little wrong)."},{"name":"PDX Six Seven One","address":"5235 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So excited to try this place out when it re-opens!

I have to say I was a little \\"let down\\".\\n\\nThe ordering experience is exactly like 4 Rivers.  You get in line and menus are available for review.  You go to the counter and order and are given a number and food is brought out when it's ready.  I have to mention I wonder why the FIRST encounter to order food takes place in front of the DESERTS ?  They looked great but my focus was not on Deserts.  I think they should be moved to a different location to better entice me to try them.\\n\\nAnyway, we ordered and the food was out fairly quickly.  The chicken fried steak (should be a no-brainer in chicken focused restaurant) arrived and it was rather dark.  Ok no biggie lets see how it tastes.....  I was unable to easily cut it and once I did it was so rubbery and completely inedible.  So for the first time in more than a year.... I had to send something back.  They apologized and were very polite and said they would have a new one made and brought out right away.  Ok so not the end of the world...mistakes happen.  After about 10 minutes (a bit longer than I expected) they brought it out but.... NO GRAVY on it.  I was told that they ran out of gravy and would bring some out soon.  Um... Chicken Fried Steak without the gravy is NOT Chicken Fried Steak.  Ok, so again...I figured at least it will be fresh and taste great.  About 5 minutes later I started to eat it plain (no gravy).  I guess it was OK tasting but nothing remarkable.  I continued slowly eating and after 15 minutes (or more) I was brought a cup of gravy.  I was glad I started eating without the gravy because my chicken was no longer hot..more of a warm.  The gravy was OK but again nothing remarkable so while they were polite, the execution of getting my food was a disaster.\\n\\nOn the plus side the appetizer Chicken slider things were amazing !  You can order 2 and they make a great meal just by themselves.  I returned a month later and that's what I did.  I got 2 of them with some sweet tea and yummy.  They are basic Chicken on a biscuit with their tasty maple bourbon sauce and pickle.  Simple and tasty.

Our waiter was along shortly to take our drink order. After our drinks arrived and he went through the night's specials, another waiter came by with what I can only describe as herb, cheese stuffed bread. He filled an olive oil plate with a light varietal of olive oil from the local shop Con Olio, (per the bottle - and one of my favorite places) and grated parmesan. It was soft, warm, and very fresh - a very  nice start.\\n\\nAmid our bread, our waiter came back to answer questions regarding the menu and offer suggestions. Our party ordered the following:\\n\\nAntipasti for the Table: Salsiccia della Casa - House made sausage with pickled peppers that was divine. It had a bright, but light spiciness and was fantastic. \\n\\nGuest 1: Caprese Salad, that was really good, and the night's special House Ravioli - Wonderful ravioli with excellent sauce, lots of wonderful flavors. \\n\\nGuest 2: Rigatoni alla Boscaiola - Ample amount of food, excellent pasta and a different type of sausage than the Antipasti, she loved it. \\n\\nMe: Involtini di Pollo - The chicken and procuitto was fabulous, lots of flavor. The pan sauce that came with it really made the meal. The mashed potatoes were light, fluffy and buttery. The wilted spinach was a little oily for my tastes, but were still very flavorful. All in all, and excellent plate. \\n\\nDessert: We ordered two cheesecakes and a tiramisu. All of them were divine, of course. The tiramisu had ample rum soaked in the bottom which was a nice punch. \\n\\nThe one thing that I really loved here was that the timing in between all ordering, drinks, and courses were very well timed. As soon as our waiter took away our bread, our appetizer was out. As soon as he took away our appetizer when we were done, our entrees were out. Very well done. Our waiter was also friendly, knowledgeable, classically trained, polite and mainly spot on with service. \\n\\nMy party did feel that the prices were a little bit high for the fare, but everything was very quality and very well done.

Additionally, I'm a Jersey gal, who grew up with diners pretty much on every corner, which I did not care for at the time.  Now that I'm older, I'm downright nostalgic about diner food and gathering there with friends on an afternoon, or for a late night bite after going out for a few drinks in my own neighborhood.  So my expectations were quite high, based upon my years of diner experiences throughout the country, but sadly, I was very disappointed.\\n\\nThe patty melt served was raw cold meat, with a side of stale chips, which must have been cooked the day before, or even longer.  The chips had a rancid taste of not being freshly cooked, not to mention the patty melt, which was cold inside and raw.  I returned the order and asked for a beef tip salad, with dressing on the side.  How can you go wrong with a salad?\\nOMG - I was wrong.  The beef on the salad was ice cold and RAW inside.  It must have been cooked earlier in the day, or even before then because it was not even slightly warm.  It's a shame, because it did seem to be a decent cut of beef and would have been terrific had been freshly cooked and warm.\\n\\nSince my server was not the least bit engaged with me as his guest, I asked another server cleaning a booth what was going on with the food.  Her comment to me was that they are having high turnover in the kitchen, which is evident in the quality of food being produced by the current staff.  When I asked to voice my concerns, the floor manager came to the table rather than the chef, which speaks volumes. \\n\\nPerhaps I went there on an \\"off\\" day, but they should be producing the best food ever, every day if they want people from the neighborhood visiting them repeatedly.

We got ribs, brisket, sausage and split a pulled pork sandwich (because it was freaking ginormous!!) They also have a smorgasbord of sides to choose from! Mac and cheese, green beans, baked beans, potato salad....the list goes on. They also have dessert and beer, as well as fountain drinks and sweet tea to wash everything down with.\\n\\nWe got a little of each and stuffed our faces all afternoon. The price is a little more than what I typically spend on food (it was about 50 bucks total for the two of us, so not at all expensive considering how much food we got). However it's the price you have to pay for the best barbecue in town! Totally worth it. The only downside is that the parking lot is a bit small. But you can always park your car across the street at the park for free! Which is what we did. \\n\\nHighly recommend going here for any special occasion you might have coming up. I decided to go back to take my mom for her bday and she loved it! And if you don't have any special reason to go, definitely make one up because you have to taste the deliciousness that is Terry Black's Barbecue BBQ for yourself!\\n\\nALSO! You can take a free tour of the bbq pits out back where they cook the mouthwatering meats to perfection. And there's also a fun little set up to take pictures at. Totally worth checking out"},{"name":"Pintxo Pincho Tapas Bar","address":"385 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent place! Taste just like your in Spain.

I hope it's good.\\" And good it was! \\n\\nThe Cowfish is exactly what it sounds like. They serve cow and fish. Not really, they serve really good burgers, sushi, fusion dishes like \\"Burgushi\\", and apps like  Crab Rangoon Dip. It's probably the best dip I've tasted in my life. Seriously...it's that good! \\n\\nIt's located at Perimeter Mall and sits next to The Cheesecake Factory. Because it's at the mall, parking is easy and plentiful. The dining space is open and the decor is modern. On my visit I ordered the Crab Rangoon Dip to share and the Granny's Southern Pimiento Cheese Burger with a few modifications. All burgers are 1/2 a pound and the burger can be made with turkey, bison, lamb, beef, chicken or veggie. The dip as I stated earlier was out of this world! The wonton chips were light and crispy, and the sweet chili drizzle was the perfect balance to the cool, creamy dip! As for my burger, it was pretty darn good. I kept looking at other tables like, \\"Ooohhh I'll try that next time!\\" So I'm sure everything is tasty. \\n\\nThere were quite a few large parties during my visit but the staff handled them with ease. My server was attentive and efficient. On the way out I stopped to take a few pics out front. There are a few games and a little play area for kids. I would definitely recommend Cowfish.

December of last year, Thierry lost my cake order for my mom's birthday cake. One manager told me that they would give two of their cakes (two smalls to compensate the lost order of a large tiramisu) for free but another manager ended up saying they had to change me. Which was fine since I did not want to waste another half an hour trying to get my mom's birthday cake. Fast forward four months, I put in my wedding cake order (I wanted individual tiramisus like the ones in the cake stand) via email, as told by one of the managers. I was very detailed in what I wanted so there wasn't any miscommunication since it was by email. I received a quote for my order and went through three managers (confirmations for the order, delivery, etc). Two weeks before my wedding, I went in to pay. I pulled up the email and showed it to the second manager who confirmed by order in the email. The bill he gave me was FOUR TIMES the amount that I was quoted in the email. I'll repeat myself, I was VERY specific in what I wanted so there WOULD NOT be any errors. It was also CONFIRMED by THREE managers. Clearly, that wasn't the deal. Even if I did my due diligence in making myself clear and confirming it multiple times, something still went wrong. I sat there for 15 minutes before the first manager, who replied my email, came over and told me that they had to type in 'canapes' to fulfill the quote they gave me in the system. *flag* I asked if they will be the same size as the ones in the case and he reassured me. That manager went into the kitchen with the second manager and the third manager processed the payment for me. I asked the third and forth manager what size did they (the first and second manager) give me. They both said that it will only be an inch or so smaller than the ones in the case. Already tired of hearing a billion different stories about the same order, I just didn't bother with arguing anymore. So after FOUR managers (I'm not really sure if they were all managers of the same level or what, it seemed like they were in charge of the front), on my wedding day, I received these tiny, TINY tiramisus (the size of a sable cookie and about 3/4 of an inch tall) in three 30 cm by 30 cm plastic take out boxes. I just couldn't believe that after being careful and detailed in putting my order in, going through FOUR managers, being reassured that they won't be tiny cakes.... I got these ridiculous looking tiny cakes. \\n\\nI've been a loyal customer since 2012 and although some people might not think that's a big deal or not, I've ordered their cakes for every family member's birthday and celebration.

We felt up for an adventure, so said we'd sit in the cellar.  \\n\\nWe were led down the steps into a low-ceilinged room that was dim, though there were many votives lit.  At first I thought the room was too hot, but I think it was just residual heat from our mile-or-so walk from the hotel.  \\n\\nI ordered water to drink and my husband ordered iced tea.  Those were fine, and came promptly.  When our drinks came we ordered samosas as an appetizer.  \\n\\nThose took awhile to arrive, luckily there was an Austin Chronicle nearby, so we read it together as we waited.  Finally a person who wasn't our waiter sat them down at the table and left.  Two samosas for $4.50 doesn't seem like a good deal ... and as soon as I cut into mine, I saw that it was heavily spiced, so I knew I'd need some raita in order to be able to eat it.  So I waited while my husband ate his samosa.  The waiter showed up a few minutes later and asked how they were, so I asked for my raita then, and he brought it shortly.  I'd expected to get more than a tiny metal cup (smaller than a shotglass) of raita, but it was more than enough for me to dip the pieces of my samosa in.  I enjoyed my samosa quite a bit once I got the raita. \\n\\nFor our main dishes, I ordered the Khuroos-E-Tursh (\\"Medallions of chicken-breast stuffed with seasoned spinach, mushrooms, onions & cheese, simmered in a rich cashew-almond cream sauce\\"), and my husband ordered the Lamb Roganjosh (\\"Tender morsels of lamb cooked in true Kashmiri style creamy onion sauce with a unique blend of spices\\").  We also asked for two orders of naan.\\n\\nSince we'd waited awhile on the samosas, we expected another long wait.  But our food came out quicker than we thought.  I was so happy to see that we got ample rice for our food.  The naan was plentiful as well, soft texture but not too soft, and wonderfully buttery.  \\n\\nOur entrees were really good!  I'm glad I cook Indian food at home though, and therefore know what-all goes into the sauces (dozens of vegetables, spices, and other ingredients in every one), otherwise I'd be disappointed to get just four silver-dollar or so size stuffed chicken medallions in sauce.  As it was, I was sad to give up one of my medallions so my husband could try my food, but I still appreciated the rich, creamy sauce, which if anything was a touch too sweet, but was really flavorful nonetheless.  The chicken was more done than what I usually get in Indian food (which is the reason that I generally order vegetarian dishes at more \\"traditional\\" Indian restaurants), but a couple of bites that I got did have that \\"only just done\\" chicken taste that I don't like. \\n\\nMy husband's food was also really great.  We'd both ordered our food medium-spicy, but his was spicier than mine just because of the nature of the dish.  It was in a red somewhat oily sauce, maybe a bit different than what we'd expected from the description.  But the lamb was amazing!  So often lamb is too tough, too fatty, or both in Indian food, but this was really tender and good.  He used the rest of my raita to cool his dish down a bit.  \\n\\nOur waiter tried to take our plates/serving dishes several times before we were finished, and each time I had to tell him that we were still working on it (mopping up sauce remnants is what naan is for, after all!).  But I guess I'd rather have that than inattentive service.\\n\\nWe finished everything except for two lonely segments of naan.  We were so full, but so happy, since our food was so good.  All in all, it was a great anniversary dinner for a reasonable price (slightly over $40)."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a perfect place to take your out of town friends desperate for \\"famous Texas Barbecue\\".

The co-owner Christopher Myers has an exemplary record co-owning several iconic Boston-area restaurants (e.g. Rialto, Via Matta, Flour Bakery).  Joanne Chang also worked at Rialto and other notable restaurants; her specialization is pastry chef.  Thus on paper, Myers & Chang would seem to have the recipe for an outstanding dining experience, rising above the plentiful assortment of Asian restaurants in the Boston area. The reality falls a bit short.  On the positive side, is well, the positive energy (\\"vibe\\") this neighborhood restaurant projects. The staff seems to really enjoy their work and their attitude is contagious.  The restaurant has a bit of a hipster vibe but not to an annoying extent.  Importantly, the food follows the trend that seems to have taken hold over the last few years: increasing spiciness (hotness) of the menu. This is somewhat to be expected at an Asian-themed restaurant inspired by flavors from Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Korea. Note: if you cannot tolerate the heat, then Myers & Chang's kitchen may not be for you.  We were dying to try the Duck Kebob but as early as 6:15 on a Sunday they were all out (this is a pet-peeve; how can a restaurant be out of a featured dish this early?!).  Our next choice, the octopus, was mostly potatoes with a few bits of tentacle.  The \\"tea-soaked\\" ribs were flavorful; the fish taco, however, was nothing you cannot find better-prepared elsewhere.  The quinoa/kimchi was excellent. Best of all was the whole lobster with ginger and scallion. Without a doubt, this is among the best I've ever had and may alone be worth the trip to the South End. The fresh rolls and the vegetable fried rice were very good,  too.  Food is served tapas-style. In other words, relatively small portions inversely proportional to their price. This is a style often found in Spanish restaurants and has creeped into nearly every hip-new restaurant.  In contrast to what you might expect, portion sizes are perhaps enough for three to share if you are not too hungry. Who goes to restaurants as a third wheel anyway?!  This seems like a diabolical calculation to maximize the revenue from every table. It has become a common practice and not at all unique to M+C.  At the end of the meal, we looked over the dessert menu. There are some promising items to choose from (Thanks, Joanne!) and we settled on the coconut cream pie. Again, tapas-sized but full-priced. The cream was fresh; there were shreds of coconut meat and a bit of lime. The pie crust was serviceable and did its job containing the pie. Although the dessert had a lot of potential, the flavor was a bit mild with the lime at times threatening to overwhelm the coconut. The addition of a bit of banana would bring all back into balance.  And this in a way is a metaphor for Myers+Chang: a restaurant with tremendous culinary potential that has not quite brought all its elements into balance."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Worst place ever for TOURISTS!!!

We've been to other bertuccis locations and had great experiences with friendly servers and fresh, delicious food. \\n\\nTo start, our waitress with purple hair (can't refer to her by name as she didn't introduce herself) approached our table as soon as we sat and said \\"all set?\\" With her own and paper ready. We hadn't even picked up menus, but decided we'd have water as we look over. She came back in about 5 minutes and we were set to order. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, buffalo flatbread appetizer, a salad as my entree and my boyfriend decided on their version of the meat lovers pizza as his entree. \\n\\nWe've both been eating super healthy lately and silly or not were really excited to calorie splurge on bread cheese and wine. \\n\\nBread immediately comes to the table and is rock hard cold. I can honestly say I've never passed up the bread at a restaurant but we hardly touched it after the first bite. Luckily, our app flatbread came out super quick. Waitress drops it at the end of the table as she's walking by. I assumed she was getting us plates to share and maybe the plate was hot, but she didn't come back. I slid to the end of the booth, grabbed our app and placed it in front of us as we used our hands as plates. Quite disappointing but hey maybe she just forgot.\\n\\nI've finished one slice of the app and I see her coming towards us. I'm about to ask for sharing plates but she makes no eye contact and drops our entrees at the end of the table. Again. I don't know how our food came out so fast or why the waitress would not pay attention to us because there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant at the time, both of which were being waited on by other servers.\\n\\n At this point all hope is lost with this waitress and I just hope the food is good as the app had been. I have absolutely no complaints about my seasonal shrimp salad besides that I wish it would've come after I had taken more than one bite of my app. It tasted fresh and I finished the entire thing.\\n\\n My boyfriends pizza, on the other hand, did not look like the delicious melty fresh pizzas we are used to getting at other bertuccis locations. The entire pizza looked like a heated up frozen pizza, which is the opposite of what we love about this chain. I honestly think a frozen pizza would've tasted better as this one did not have melty cheese or meat that wasn't grey.\\n\\nNot even halfway into our entrees, the waitress drops the bill (at the end of our table again).

The night we visited they were offering a special, $5 growler + the usual $10 fill. Since I wanted a souvenir of our visit, my babygirl bought me a Burnside labeled growler and a fill of what was my favorite beer out of the sampler, the Burnside Stout. \\n\\nWhere this story takes a turn for the worse is the next morning, when I opened the refrigerator in the hotel room, there was delicious, dark brown beer running down the insides of the fridge. I cleaned up the mess, then we headed back to Burnside to replace what I thought to be a faulty cap. \\n\\nAfter waiting my turn, I told the bartender what happened. She asked if I had opened it, I said \\"no\\". She then poured a bit into a glass to taste it. This I found odd since \\"what if\\" somebody had tainted it? She said it tasted fine and I should have made sure the cap was tight. Trust me, I have minor OCD so I checked for tightness of the cap at several points throughout the night. When I put it into the trunk, when I took it out of the trunk, before I put it in the fridge. Check! Check! Check!

I stopped in with a friend for brunch on the strength of a vaguely remembered recommendation and the ambience hitting all the right notes. Organic and local promised attention to food quality on top of simple preparation, as did the prominence of coffee in its signage. The bar which runs along one wall knew all the right secret winks, eagerly displaying its Campari, Chartreuse, St. Germain, and related in-the-know liqueurs. The menu was on the short side, but coherent in a way that spoke to it being well thought out. The brick walls, center bar-seating, and general clean black lines spoke of modern understated class.\\n\\nThen our coffee came. I picked up the spoon and stirred off a bit of the heat (remarking how good the silver felt in my hand; seriously, the cutlery may have been the best part of the meal). But liquid to lips, the brew was over-roasted and over-extracted. My friend's espresso was apparently no better (and our waitresses \\"how would I know if this were a double?\\" might have tipped us off that she was not a barista par-excellence).\\n\\nWe sipped on our coffee while waiting for our food, which considering they were both eggs and there was only one other party in the restaurant, you may have been forgiven for expecting to come sooner. I got two over-medium, and one was definitely spot-on, but the other was just as definitely over-hard (which may be a picky distinction, but if I'm ordering eggs at brunch, I expect them to be done perfectly. I can make inconsistent eggs myself at home). I think overall neither of our dishes were bad in any meaningful way, but neither was anything special, either, and given the density of places to get decent eggs, any demerit is going to outshine any adequacy.\\n\\nIn the end, the brunch experience was a decided meh. I would believe that they might be more on their game if we had come earlier in the service (this was pushing one, and the staff was clearly a bit wearied), and I would also believe that their lunch/dinner/bar menu might be better, but I also wouldn't be surprised if it was the same well-presented but ultimately unexceptional fare that we found at brunch."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The d√©cor of this place is amazingly beautiful.

The \\"corn battered pig face\\" was overly seasoned so that the only flavor that was present was cinnamon. The spicy pork cheek overrode the scallops' flavor with a heavy-hand of chipotle.

They have a nice patio for the warmer months but get there early because it fills up quickly."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I generally dislike coffee houses for a few reasons:\\n\\n1) They're almost always small and cramped.  \\n2) People go not so much to drink coffee, but to use as a sort of a library/free workplace.  (This makes #1 on my list even more of an issue.) \\n3) The coffee I make at home tastes nearly as good and costs a fraction of the price.\\n\\nBut even though most coffee houses already have a few strikes against them in my book, I really like Cherrywood Coffeehouse.  \\n\\nFood and drink is served quickly (even when there's a large line) and is quite good and reasonably priced.  It's a big enough building to accommodate many (both inside and out) without feeling too big.  But perhaps the best thing, and really this only applies to those with kids, is that they have free kids entertainment on Sunday morning.  \\n\\nOther than the parking situation, which is woefully inadequate, I came away very impressed with Cherrywood and likely to come back again."},{"name":"Sea Level Oyster Bar","address":"94 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I met my brother for lunch.  The weather was iffy so the sides were down on the deck.  The sound level was deafening and the service was slow.  I ordered the \\"special\\" which was coconut shrimp that with came with daikon and carrots with salad.  I got my plate and it had 4 large unshelled coconut shrimp - heads included - over a few greens with almost no carrots or daikon.  The shrimp had to be de-shelled and de- headed which of course removed all of the coconut.  My husband said later - \\"that was the most unappetizing presentation that I've seen\\" !   I had to remove all the shells and heads and was left with little  actual shrimp.  The salad was small and only after I had a slice of my husbands pizza, I felt full.  There were no wet naps etc for this finger messy meal.  It was not what I expected and it I'd known that the shrimp weren't shelled,  I would never have ordered.  And to top it off, it wasn't very good."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Service sucks and so does the timing of brining out your food.

We've gone on a few occasions for drinks.  Great wine selection, but, I've also taken a liking to the pure bliss drink.  It's great!  Other than the meat and cheese plates (which are good for snacking), I've had the scallops and steak.  All were very good.  Nice place for a quiet low key night.  If your looking for a fun live atmosphere, this probably isn't the place."},{"name":"Hungry Howie's Pizza & Subs","address":"3424 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Typical Hungry Howie's pizza with the flavored crust.

As a Counter Culture devotee I was excited to see Render serves it and gets such high ratings.\\n\\nOur experience was great; most importantly my latte was fabulous, if a touch sweet. We decided to have lunch there and the bacon cheddar (!) quiche was really wonderful, while Rich's chicken wrap was pretty mediocre. The service was excellent and they have high chairs, something I didn't expect of a place this size/hipsterness.\\n\\nParking would be a huge bonus here, as would about triple the space. Oak Square, while most definitely not the South End, would be thrilled to have a first-rate coffee shop. Just saying..."},{"name":"Sea Level Oyster Bar","address":"94 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"Went on a Friday evening for a nice meal with my family. The crowd was more drunk loud and rowdy here. They messed up my order, but I just ate what they gave me anyway. Didn't want to bother shouting over people to talk to the waitress. Wherever she was... The food tasted just ok I guess. Overall uncomfortable atmosphere. Even down to the seating. I definitely prefer finz next door"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Bravo Hopdoddy! \\n\\nThe menu is straightforward, has just enough variety to please the burger lover and their non-burger eating buddies (Ahi tuna burger, veggie burger, lamb burger, turkey). The staff  knows what they are doing, I imagine they are extremely busy their entire shift, yet they still maintain a friendly and accommodating nature and you can tell they care. We went for the first time on a Saturday night. We hit the place right before the line became intimidating and would have made my low blood sugar hubby cry. I do not eat burgers very often, so when I do, I want it to be better than what I can make at home, use quality ingredients and not be cooked beyond recognition. Hopdoddy is that and so much more. The buns are made in house, fresh. They source local products when possible, I love, love, love this. They recycle, thank you!; foodservice establishments do not have to do this and this takes time, effort and $ on their part. They make their own fries with a Kennebec potato which is less starchy and more flavorful. They make their own ice cream for shakes, get out! Best of all, they know how to cook a burger, this is unfortunately a rare talent, seriously. It was juicy, ample in size and not over dressed with toppings, a nice balance. They serve great beers on tap, a few wines, have a sports bar urban chic decor. Great for family, dates, hanging out with buddies. Keep it up Hopdoddy!"},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"this place is crazy expensive BUT well worth it!! absolutely delicious [we had the chopped beef, turkey, bean, green beans, mac 'n cheese & peach cobbler] we will definitely come back if we're ever in austin!!"},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Placed a reservation online for a Friday night and to our surprise they were booked solid until 8:30 so we took that reservation.  I arrived at 825 for our 830 reservation and was greeted immediately and given a table near the sushi counter.  I sat for about 5 mins before anyone approached me and the person who finally did was a manager.  The manager took my order for water and returned about 2 minutes later and since my date was not in yet I assume no one approached my table again think about 5-10 mins after said date found me and sat themselves as nobody greeted or attempted to assist them as they entered.\\n\\nOnce we finally placed our orders the server apologized for our wait and took out food orders which included - appetizers: spicy tuna poke (date did not enjoy and neither did I as it was pretty bland) and blackened tuna nachos (also bland despite the mounds of different sauces, capers, feta, etc that adorned the dish and not blackened at all; our entrees included the black truffle cheese burger lettuce wrap for my spouse and the lamb burger for myself and both were way too salty.  My spouse also tried the seaweed salad and cucumbers which were both a miss for us.\\n\\nLastly we did have drinks of course which were decent but I mean it's a cocktail.  The prosecco was bubbly and sweet (thumbs up) while the sake sampler was good, but we've had better.  My spouse ordered a beer from Athens and I can't remember the name but it is a very floral IPA and very acquired.  \\n\\nI can not say this will be a place we'll recommend or even return as for us it definitely did not live up to the hype."},{"name":"El Potro Mexican Grill","address":"156 Highland Ave","city":"Malden","stars":"4.5","text":"Local \\"hoodie\\" here.  Was hoping to find an alternative to the Mexican chain in Station Landing, so I Yelp'd Mexican food and El Potro comes up.  What a wonderful surprise!  Food was fresh and delicious.  Service was attentive and respectful.  The Mariachi band was a BIG BONUS and found them so entertaining.  We went full boat; appetizers, mains, deserts, drinks.. so the bill wasn't cheap and I wouldn't call this place cheap.  We were happy to pay the bill that night.  Everything was GREAT."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I finally got around to eating here today and i must say i cant understand any rating less than 4 stars.  The burgers and appetizers here are out of this world.  I had the steak tartare burger.  Since it was a burger i didnt know if it was going to be true, uncooked steak tartare.  Let me tell you, its the real deal.  Completely uncooked, raw, and seasoned perfectly.  Its nice that a casual place like this serves steak tartare because usually only very high end places serve it.  Fries and onion rings are great too.  I went with a friend and she had the flip burger.  She said she ordered it medium but it looked to both of us to be on the rare side.  It was to rare for her to eat so i ate the second half of her burger too.  Didnt try any of the shakes because i'm not really into sweets but its neat seeing them boil with the liquid nitrogen.  The burgers are what i like though and that is why i'll go back."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Eh... I don't really see what all of the fuss is about this place. We went the other night for a quick dinner and overall found the experience to be very disappointing. The patio area was way too hot, the tacos were way too greasy, and the flavors were overwhelmed by too much salt. In a place like Austin where taco stands are more prevalent than Starbucks or McDonald's, you really need to step it up a notch if you want to stand out, and I just don't think El Chilito really does that. I'll stick with their more upscale brother El Chile in the future."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went back to Flip after my initial experience, and I found the service to be just as good as the good.

Went here after brunch and I got the cinnamon vanilla sugar and it was sweet but not too sweet. I'm not too much of a donut person but if I could have ordered 82748832 of them, I probably would have. My friend got the blueberry bourbon and that was just as good. To top it off, there was no line! You could tell that the donuts were made fresh, comparing it to Voodoo where I thought the donuts were kind of stale. We heard there was a blue star at the airport and just had to bring some home! Definitely worth coming back for!"},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love this place since it's in the neighborhood and they have good food. But the best part is the Happy Hour. It's Mon-Sat 5-7 and all day on Sunday. My favorite is the Green Mountain roll which is spicy tuna and what seems like tempura flakes wrapped in avocado for $5! There are also a lot of other great $4 rolls and I like to get a side of fried rice and miso soup to round out my meal. Definitely recommend this place!"},{"name":"La Mamma Pizza And More","address":"190 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3","text":"I wish I could explain the \\"Sicilian pizza\\" but I can't it tasted like middle school cafeteria lunch pizza.

For our entree we split chicken fried rice, which was my favorite of the dishes we tried. We also split the house chow mien, which included plenty of shrimp but they were very small and the whole dish was nothing special.
