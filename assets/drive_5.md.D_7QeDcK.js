Say it isn't so! But it is. When I first heard about the idea for the COOP--a fast casual style restaurant offering up chicken and general homestyle Southern foods, I was undeniably excited. Our first attempt to visit was thwarted due to the fact that the line was wrapped around the block and we had both worked long work days, so we were unwilling at the time to get through the wait to quite literally get in the door. Our second attempt was more successful, and we waited in an approximately 45 minute line in order to receive food that, in my humble opinion, is only worth about three stars. \\n\\nAside from the crazy long line to get served (which I can tolerate for great food), the fact of the matter was that the COOP's fried chicken really was not that great. I decided to get the fried chicken strips, which were small and wimpy looking on my plate. I also went with a side of carrots, which were ok (for some reason they were luke warm and not as sweet as I prefer them) as well as cornbread (which was actually very moist and delicious). My partner in crime had the chicken and waffles, which he also felt was not as warm as it should have been (temperature-wise). \\n\\nThe one thing I did enjoy about The COOP though would have to be the decor of the restaurant. The look is definitely modern vintage southern flair if that makes any sense--wood tables and light colors, combined with mismatched hand carved chairs around every table, complete with a porch/patio area. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, if I do go back to the COOP, it will be a little further off in the future once all of the hype from this new restaurant dies down.

At Barley Swine, each and every course on the regular menu was creatively (even robustly) matched with a stunning vegetarian option.

The pies were the closest thing to real Italian pizza we have had in the United States. In fact, they were better than most of the tourist area places in Italy.\\n\\nThe restaurant is well lit and has a clean atmosphere. Husband's fears of a crowded wait didn't happen. The owner (Mike) gave us a friendly welcome and moved a table around so we didn't have to sit by the door. The restaurant is small - probably seating less than 30. The door opens right into the eating area, but that is the only potential drawback we saw during the whole evening. Many of the tables (including ours) would not be bothered.\\n\\nThe wine list had a good selection of Italian reds and whites. Husband was delighted to see \\"Le Fin Du Monde\\" on the beer list. The menu had a list of their special pizzas, but might said they could prepare others. The interesting thing was that many of the ingredients on their specials weren't the usual ones you see in America. These were like the ingredients we saw when we lived in Italy. They even had Buffala Mozzarella which is a premium cheese (from water buffalo - not bison) used  in Italy.\\n\\nWe ordered a large Margherita  (15 inch). About three minutes later it came. They said that their wood burning oven can turn out a pizza in 90 seconds. It was everything we had hoped for. Thin crust with a light puffy edge and a fresh, naturally sweet sauce. We finished it quickly and ordered a their spicy pizza which Husband always ordered in Italy. Another winner.\\n\\nCaution: This is not your 'high school date night'  or 'Friday night out with the family' pizza. It is expensive compared most local places, but with the quality of the toppings and sauce it can be a totally different experience. We like some of our local pizza places, but Piccola Napoletanio is just at a different level.\\n\\nOn the ride home, all we could talk about was how much we missed the food in Italy and how we wanted to come back to this restaurant again.\\n\\nWe had a good conversation with the owner after the meal who told us about the restaurant (Prides Osteria) he has about a block up the street that tries to prepare \\"farm to table\\" products in a northern Italian style. He said the chef was from Genoa. \\n\\nWe said we'd try it. The next morning, Husband had checked their website and we made plans to go their that night.

Cocktails were good, but tiny for the price.  We ordered the dip combo meze, also very small servings of dips served with lavosh bread, not even pita.  Any greek knows these dips need pita.  The crunchy lavosh takes away from the taste of the smooth dips.  We asked for some pita instead, which they happily provided....for another $5.  The red peper feta dip was the only one id order again.  Others were unremarkable, even the tzaziki, which is hard to go wrong with.  The grilled octopus was delicious, so tender with a lovely charred smoky flavor.  Would love that again, but doubtful we will return.  Hubby ordered the lamb shank, which he couldn't eat.  It had a lemony/vinegary taste,  quite tangy for what should have been a savory hearty dish.  I had the black grouper which was nicely done overall, however, no clams in the clam leek ragout, maybe it was supposed to be leek clam-juice ragout?   We had the dessert trio, which besides being very small, included ice creams atop the baklava and galactaboureka which masked what may have been good pastries.  We also started off with only one knife, and no serving spoon when we got our appetizers.  When the combo dips and desserts were served there was no explanation of what each was, the dishes were each just placed without comment.

I really wanted to like this place and am giving them this feedback in the hopes they improve their menu items so I can become a regular here. \\n\\nWe started by asking for a wine menu, which apparently they don't have. The waitress was pleasant, but not knowledgeable.  The prices are a bit high for the quality you get.\\n\\nThe bottle of wine we got is typically $25 at other restaurants, here it was $33. We also ordered a glass of it once we finished the bottle and they charged us $10.02. No, that's not a typo - what an odd price. Also, a glass should cost about 1/4 of what the bottle costs (~$8.25 would have been reasonable)\\n\\nWe started with oysters, which were fresh and there was a nice selection. We followed that with the heirloom tomato salad priced at $13. It was fresh and a good sized portion. We then ordered a small plate of Maine crab cakes ($9) which were a nice portion and while it was real crab, it was not fresh and had a fishy taste to it. \\n\\nInstead of us each ordering a meal we decided to share the lobster role, which unfortunately also tasted fishy. At $25 I better love it! But unfortunately it was not fresh and the slaw that came with it was doused in vinegar. The waitress was attentive enough to notice that we didn't eat it and offered us something else. We figured we'd steer clear of fish and try the BBQ ribs which are an odd item on the menu. I'd say they are just ok, but not something we'd get again. I'd recommend they replace the ribs with a burger or a steak which is something the menu is missing.

Both times, the owner, Uwe, came by our table to say 'hi' which I thought was a nice, personal touch and he actually remembered us from the first time we came! \\n\\nSo on our 2nd visit, we decided to do the 6-course tasting menu ($95/pp) which was a way better deal than ordering individual plates.  We had a tasty amuse bouche to start of pate and apple gel, followed by our 6-courses consisting of scallop & fois gras, char, onsen egg, 2x lamb entrees, and one of the best tasting desserts we've ever had (see pictures). Dessert was hands-down our favorite, followed by the scallop & fois gras with the beets done 3-ways,  and the char. These dishes all played with different textures and different flavor combinations which we really enjoyed. I enjoyed the onsen egg in its hearty thick broth as well but my hubby didn't.  Unfortunately the lamb dishes were a bit too salty and not very imaginative, but I see these as the dishes to fill us up- they weren't bad, just not memorable.  \\n\\nThey also offer a 4-course tasting ($75/pp) and a 5-course tasting ($85/pp) menu.  I could probably do with a 5-course but hubby said he felt 6-course was just enough to fill him.\\n\\nI'm definitely glad we choose Bauhaus for one of our rare, baby-free date nights.  When you enter, it doesn't feel pretentious or really high-end - which I feel is fitting for the Gastown area that they're in, and also fitting for the restaurant's name. But the food is really fine dining and really, I'm all about food.  The service was also OK- our waiter was friendly but absent a lot and took a while to take our order.

As we sat there my cousin got some kind of tangerine drink and I a coke no alcohol.

Then I ask for a little guacamole this I expected to pay, ok that being said I got a tiny bowl with about 2 tablespoons of guacamole. This guacamole cost $6. $3 for the fountain coke. When I ordered I asked for extra sour cream, big mistake that also cost $6 it was maybe a quarter of a pint. Then to top it all off the tacos had to be the toughest tacos on earth. It wasn't just the meat it was the tortilla, everything. So for 6 tacos 1 nacho ex sour cream a small thing of guacamole and I mean small, and 2 drinks, and chips and salsa. It cost $58.

But how about with these dishes: Bacon and oyster omelettes, with saut√©ed onions and  an ever-so-slight bite (from cayenne in the oyster breading, I figure). A delectable, tender omelette, creamy on the inside, and filled with excellent gruyere, herbs, and a fistful of chanterelles (our waiter said: \\"Our forager has been bringing us basketsful of chanterelles this season\\"). A hash of cauliflower tossed  with black olives, home fries, and feta and seasoned with harissa, topped with the afore-mentioned soft scrambled eggs. That one just might have been my favorite.\\n\\nSome of these dishes were accompanied by a small green salad of really fresh greens, dressed with a light vinaigrette.\\n\\nAccompaniments are also excellent. Fresh-squeezed orange juice clearly was: one day, it had a slightly tart, acidic bite; the next morning, it was a bit sweeter. Berry muffins one morning had just enough sugar in them to develop a slightly crunchy exterior, but not too much to be cloying. My colleagues enjoyed their (Illy) coffee [true confession: I'd had my caffeine fix at Stumptown, right next door).\\n\\nThe room at the Bijou is light and airy--or it was on the days we were there, when the Portland weather was fairly sunny in the morning. And service is friendly and professional, but not overdone. And truly, that's in keeping with the food: first-class but delicious and approachable, with unexpected tastes that are very well balanced between bolder flavors and more nuanced ones.\\n\\nMy first visit to the Bijou was in 1982 when friends took me there for breakfast. At the time, there were many abandoned buildings on Third Street and I clearly remember how the cafe's lights beckoned to us. I also remember how much I enjoyed the food then: I ate my first marionberry muffin at the Bijou. So it's with great delight that I returned and found that the cafe wasn't only in business--having survived the intervening years--but that it's in fact even better than it was in those days. That's no mean feat in an industry where it's very tempting for long-established restaurants to coast on their reputations and grow slowly worse every year until they suddenly close. So, congratulations to the owner and staff: and rest assured that when I'm in Portland, I'll be a regular. Bacon and oyster omelette, anyone?"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"One of the best burgers in Austin.  It's always obscenely busy so go for an early or late meal or just at an odd time to avoid the crowd.  Buffalo bills was the first burger I had there and loved it.  I am a huge fan of their tuna burger (I know it sounds weird but it's amazing).  The wasabi adds great taste to it.  Their fries are also good although I don't usually have the stomach room for them but they have all kinds of condiments to add to your burger/fries.  I personally love their chipotle ketchup.

This spot is definitely a mix of pluses and minuses. The cocktails are very nice, though priced a little on the high side for what you get. I've tried a few of the shakes and while the descriptions sound interesting and unique, what you get isn't really anything special. (If you're a big shake fan then there's certainly nothing wrong with them.) On the menu it states, \\"All burgers at FLIP burger boutique are fully composed dishes created by our chef. Each element of the burger has been specifically chosen for flavor profile, texture, and presentation.\\" I assume that's code for, \\"Please don't try and customize these burgers,\\" because depending on who your server is, if you do ask to make substitutions you can be made to feel like it's a huge inconvenience - and honestly that's not the service level I'd expect at the price point of the restaurant.  The buns they choose definitely don't pair well with some of the burgers - the bun is a bit greasy and crumbly and the times I got the bun I regretted it because it definitely lowered the quality of the burgers I ordered overall. I definitely preferred the lettuce wrap. The sweet potato tots are good and worth ordering if that's your kind of thing.  The brussels sprouts were a little soggy when I tried them.  Also, watch your bill because one time I went I received my bill, checked the amount and handed over my credit card. When the credit card was returned to me with the bill to sign, the base amount I'd been charged had been increased by almost $3 (not cool).

It wasn't bad. The salad bar was well stocked and fresh. We were trying to make our way through it and there was one lady in front of us, but she was fundraising her way through the line and every couple of seconds she would completely stop and be yammering at the employees. UGH!!! My husband told me to move around her, but there were 4 of us and I figured that would be kinda rude. I guess the jokes on me.\\n\\nI wasn't terribly impressed with the soups. There were a lot of them, but I really only had a desire to try 2 of them. I sampled the tomato soup and the clam chowder. The chowder was simply ok, I didn't really care for the tomato soup at all. It was just missing something, maybe that sweetness that I enjoy in my tomato soup. I don't know, I just found it to be very boring. The chowder was creamy and nice, I added bacon to mine which brought up the salt level.\\n\\nThe breads were delish. They had a macaroni and cheese bread that I thought was fantastic and clever. The bread didn't have macaroni on it, but it did have cheese and the cracker crumble that homemade macaroni and cheese has, and lots of it. It was this crunchy, salty, cheesy, soft breaded goodness that is such a unique combo that I fell in love with it on the spot.\\n\\nI have to mention that I got a baked sweet potato and that poor little thing had been charred to a crisp. The foil and the bottom of the potato were blackened and it ruined the whole potato. Sad. I shall mourn that poor little sweet potato.... it was so young, take me instead!!!!\\n\\nThe dessert options left me wanting. I didn't care for much of any of it. The \\"ice cream\\" tasted more like ice milk, the brownie was sitting in this sauce that tasted thin and non fatty. I get it, it's healthy. Healthy desserts suck. That wasn't a brownie, it was a frownie. It made me frown.\\n\\nOverall, the place was clean and the salad bar had lots of options. If you are in to the whole health scene, this is the place for you. I'm waiting for Cracker Barrel to open up a buffet place, so you can just guess where I fall on the whole healthy subject. \\n\\nMy biggest complaint was the entry set up, needing to drag my purse along the salad bar (it was a weird set up) before even getting to just be seated. I did NOT like that. Additionally getting stuck behind that woman who was trying to multitask and would not step aside, my issue here was the employees that LET her do this.

Looking at the menu and bar I had visions of drink specials dancing in my head, las it is not to be.  My appointment was at 12:30 and I stepped in and checked in to the restaurant at 11:45a. This is a texas bbq joint that looks better than the surrounding area. Prices are definitely above normal for the area especially considering the competition I'm putting them up against, Heirloom market BBQ, which is 5 minutes from work. \\n\\nI order the 3 meats and 2 sides @ a total of $22. I'm sorry but that is ridiculously priced, especially for someplace out of the way as this. Sliced brisket @ $2 extra instead of chopped. BTW who gets brisket chopped? Texas sausage and pulled pork. My sides were collards and coleslaw. I asked what type of slaw wondering if its vinegar or mayo based as I was just wondering. The nice waitress said it was vinegar. Okey doke I placed my order.\\n\\nAt 12:20 I received my plate. Not good, it shouldn't take 1/2 an hour to get a plate of pre-cooked food. They forgot one of the sides and the slaw was vinegar not mayo, not a ding against the mayo but the server should know the menu. The \\"plate\\" was served in a cast iron skillet that was refrigerator cold, why. Why use a skillet if you're not gonna heat it up? The presentation was nice but I was underwhelmed by the portions expecting 3/4 of meat. I just didn't see it.\\n\\nThe slaw was alright, the collards were really pretty good, the pulled pork was cooked well but no smoke flavor that I could tell. The sausage could have been good, i couldn't tell as it came sliced and drenched in this vinegar/mustard based sauce that took over the sausage completely. The sauce was alright but unneeded as they serve it table side as well plus sausage is spicy and flavorful alone or it should be. The brisket, supposedly the saving grace of Texas BBQ was dry, overcooked and tough.\\n\\nIn short the value is low, the flavor and portions are equally low but they have drink specials with free popcorn for what its worth."},{"name":"Sip","address":"3029 SE 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love their fresh juice!

As visitors to Portland for the first time, we were not in the know about certain things. Long story short: we were biking around, stopped in for a drink and food, forgot something in our bike saddle bags. My partner went out to get it and happened to commit the terrible sin of walking through the restaurant without shoes. Hey its Portland right? I was immediately confronted in a kurt and rather unfriendly manner by the manager. I apologized immediately and began to gather his shoes to meet him at the door. The manager then confronted me a second time, for some reason, to say that he could not have my partner walking around with bare feet. I told him that I understood and that I was taking his shoes to meet him at the door for when he returned. Then he confronted my partner at the door when he returned in an equally surly and hostile manner. I know because I was right behind him waiting for my partner at the door with his shoes. Obviously, we don't want to break any rules and so we would not have minded being corrected in a polite manner, but this did not happen. Minutes later, we stepped outside for a smoke, and again the manager stalked us outside and rudely told us we had to go around the corner of the building and could not sit at the benches outside and have a smoke. We were all too happy to comply; we just wished he could have displayed a little less naked hostility. \\n\\nIf you ask many people of color after interactions like this one, whether they felt skin pigment could have played a role, I think most will tell you that it at least crosses your mind. I cannot and will not say for sure that this was a factor in our thoroughly negative experience. But it crossed our minds, because his reaction seemed far out of proportion of the provocation. I hate even feeling that this could be a possibility. \\n\\nWe are polite, civic-minded and thoughtful people. We all err.

Got seated by the food bar and got to watch a single guy butter buns, a guy toast buns, and another guy actually plate the buns. They got their  assembly system set. Ordered the lamb burger and nutella shake. The lamb burger looked really darn good. Pretty small sized, about the size of my palm, but it made up for it vertically, thick slab of lamb and some sauteed veggies. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as it looked. Bun was nicely toasted, but the burger itself had no kick or tang or any real flavor. If I'm going to pay $$ for a burger, I want it to kick me in the face and burst in your mouth with flavor. The yogurt sauce they had on there just didn't cut it. Fries were decent as well as the onion rings, meaning neither sucked enough for me to remember not liking it. Now the nutella shake is the only reason I gave this place one more star than I think it deserves. I'm such a sucker for science and freshly toasted marshmellows. So I practically squeled when they placed a gaseous foaming, toasted marshmellow concoqtion in front of me. Just the right amount of chocolate with nutella goodness. Not too sweet ad the perfect icey consistency. I dream about it on some nights.\\n\\nI probably won't be back here, because the food didn't do it for me.

I have eaten in small cafes in the back streets of Spain to the Haute Cuisine of France, never have I been as happy with my dining experience as I was with Barley Swine.\\n\\nAs a HUGE Foodie, I was thrilled and excited to be seated at the bar, right next to the chef while he was orchestrating his masterpiece evening performance. \\n\\nMy dining companion and I eat out in one of Austin top restaurants once a month. She is a pescatarion, and I am a carnivore. The waiter suggested we order 6 dishes and share. That was not going to happen. \\n\\nShe ordered the Arugula, grilled potato, goat cheese fondue, pine nuts salad. Her comment was that is was very well balanced and a perfect starter. \\n\\nMy first course was the Sweetbreads special. I am a huge sweetbreads fan, and they were perfect!\\n\\nWe shared a plate of Scallops, spicy pork cheek, curried sweet potato, raisin relish. We both agreed the curried sweet potato was an extremely intelligent part of the dish.\\n\\nNext she had the Chickpea fritters, sesame dressing, sweet potato. I believe this was her favorite dish. The texture and flavor combinations were mindblowing.\\n\\nI was presented with the Duck special. I have had duck many places, and it has always been too dry. This duck was perfect. It gave me hope about this protein being served in restaurants. The portion was perfect and the flavors bold. Who would think to encrust a duck breast in Morrocan spices?\\n\\nMy friend's next dish was Fried shellfish risotto, soft scrambled egg, lobster mushroom and mine was the Butternut squash ice cream, grilled foie gras, sage funnel cake. For both of our dishes we marveled at how Chef Bryce would create such delish creations. Does he stay up at nice dreaming up how to put grilled fois gras with butternut ice cream and combine shellfish in to a risotto with a scambled egg? I think the most intruguing part of this course was the maple snow that topped the butternut squash, fois gras and sage funnel cake. I loved the texture and the mouth feel of this maple snow.\\n\\nHer next dish was the Hopelessly blue cheese, corn bread. The cheese was perfect and the corn bread was perfect flavor and texture. If there was a miss for me, it was the corn bread. I didn't care for it as much as she did.\\n\\nMy final dish was the Smoked pecan fudge, marshmallow, cocoa nibs, salted caramel ice cream. This is one of the best desserts I have ever consumed. It was paired with a Vanilla Porter.  Fantastic!\\n\\nThroughout our meal, we enjoyed a bottle of 2008 BR Cohn Cabernet. It was on the menu as a 2007. \\n\\nAs a whole, after dining together in Austin for the sole purpose of finding fabulous \\"foodie\\" establishments for the past 3 years, we found Barley Swine to be our top or within the top two restaurants we have experienced. \\n\\nNot only do I Highly Recommend this foodie think tank, I am planning on going back...over, over and over again.

Other than not being spicy like i enjoy. the food was fine. I will even say it was very good.  portions were fine. I had specifically asked for fresh chili peppers on the side to give some kick to my food. It just may have been a communication gliche  because the waitress brought me dried chilli powder. Both orders had lots of fresh vegetables and they were crisp and not over cooked. which is perfect. Briocolli, zuchinni, carrots, onions, mushrooms. and plenty of them. And fresh mushrooms not the rubbery tinned mushrooms that many restaurants use to save money. They have brown rice which is a big plus also. \\n\\nThe only complaint i have is the price. drunked noodles at $11 and spicy eggplant(augurgines) at $13 .

That all being said, the actual dining experience has recently been less amazing.\\n\\nFirst, the setup. This is the oldest restaurant in Columbus and is famous for their german sausages. Typically when you come, you get the all-you can eat buffet which includes few sides (and good ones) along with access to all the different kinds of sausage. They also have cream puffs bigger than your fist that are to die for. My wife is from Columbus and this was one of the places we *always* went whenever we visited.\\n\\nWe had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and found out they have an amazing private event space upstairs with two room set up off a hallway made to look like a cobblestone street complete with street lamps. The set up the buffet in \\"street\\" and your guests can go help themselves as they see fit. It was amazing.\\n\\nThat all being said, the last few times we've been I've felt like the sausages in the buffet, while good, aren't as good as they are when I grill them at home. I don't know if they're boiling them instead of grilling them, or grilling on a metal hot plate instead of over fire, but it's just disappointing. Not that they aren't good--they still are--but they are not as good as they could and should be.\\n\\nStill, the ambiance is great, the sausages are good, the sides are great, there's even some local craft beer on tap now.

All of the stars here are based on the environment, location, and convenience of being able to get decent Ethiopian food. The food quality itself did not impress me.\\n\\nDesta is a great option for those not familiar with Ethiopian food. It has a cute and trendy environment, especially to sit on the outside porch when it's nice outside. However, the food itself was ok for Ethiopian food, but not great. I would say quite pricy for what you actually get. To accommodate unfamiliar customers with the cuisine, this place does individual entrees... which is so odd to me. Honestly because I'm used to sampling many types of dishes at once because Ethiopian food is almost always served with family portions, I ordered the Veggie Platter to get a little bit of everything. However, it was disappointing because it was just a tiny drop of each selection---and brought out cold when I got it. I felt like this was almost an appetizer... and I was left unsatisfied. I filled up on injera, of course. The injera itself was really good. If I were to get multiple entrees here, it would probably be too complicated, expensive, and not worth it because of the individually-accommodated portions here. Service was incredibly slow, so make sure you are patient and have plenty of time.\\n\\nNonetheless, it's an ok option with a better atmosphere than most places.

I went to Render's this morning as my typical coffee spot of choice, Farmer Horse Market, was closed for renovations and I have heard other neighbors mentioning good things about Render as a coffee shop that has been in the neighborhood for a long time. I am sorry to say but I did not enjoy my experience in the least bit and we will not be going back. \\n\\nFor starters, the person behind the counter was just a tad rude and unwelcoming to my dog, which I found weird considering the neighborhood is so dog friendly. The person said my dog could was allowed in the shop (with my fiance) while I ordered but that she could not linger; I accepted that without any problems as we were just on our morning walk and had no intention of lingering and different establishments have different policies; I understand my dog isn't entitled to go everywhere and 100% respect that.\\n\\nHowever, at the end of our transaction, the individual once again repeats \\"Like I said, your dog can only be in here while you order\\" which felt somewhat aggressive since I had already agreed to those terms just thirty seconds earlier (or however long it takes to order two coffees; meanwhile, my fiance was sitting with our dog at the entrance of the shop just waiting for us). \\n\\nI was annoyed and replied \\"yes, that's what I'm doing...\\" but it wouldn't have been a dealbreaker if the coffee was good -- and it was not good. In fact, the cold brewed coffee was the WORST I have ever tasted. The cold brewed coffee was so bad, in fact, that I contemplated returning it. It was bitter and acidic. Either the beans are low quality, reused, or the coffee isn't actually cold brewed at all. I couldn't stomach drinking more than half and just threw it away. \\n\\nA good cold brewed coffee should be so smooth that you taste no bitterness or acidity. It is an enjoyable experience all on its own. A good example is from Farmer Horse Market on Mass Av. next to the T-station.

I mean, if Costco can sell me bottle after bottle of $9-10 wine that was rated 89 or 90 by Wine Spectator, why can't Andiamo sell me something decent for $25?  Mirabelle can...\\n\\nService was very good - we had the type of waiter who wouldn't constantly intervene, but would hover at the back of the dining room and then jump in the second you made eye contact.  That makes me feel important and even a government peon like myself needs to feel important from time-to-time.  \\n\\nBut the main reason I'm going to give Andiamo 4 stars instead of 3:  when we arrived, the owner/manager/somebody who looked to be in charge gave us a complimentary glass of Prosecco simply because we had to wait 20 minutes or so for a table.  Where do you NOT have to wait for a table in Austin on a Friday night?  Well done, Andiamo.

There is some magic in their dough, I don't know what they do but you can taste it especially on donuts without the frills, like the simple OG. Seasonally I really like the Chocolate Peppermint. The matcha one's good too just eerily a little too similar to a matcha latte. Chocolate buttermilk is to die for and so is the apple fritter.

In April, I came at 5:45 and had to wait 1.5 hour.  This time, I played it smart and showed up at 4:55 and was maybe the fifth party in line.  We were seated promptly when doors opened at 5 PM.  Chose to sit at the bar.  The menu changes month-to-month with whatever fresh ingredients are available to Chef Gilmore.  The menu consists of all small plates: think tapas or dim sum.  They say a person would eat approx. 3 plates.  This time, instead of choosing off the menu, we decided to ask for a chef's tasting menu: 6 of the chef's favorite dishes.  This is what the chef sent us: 1) grilled carrot salad with goat ricotta and almond brown butter; 2) beer-battered zucchini and mussels with basil dressing; 3) quick-grilled scallops in shishito pepper and cucumber; 4) olive oil poached halibut with summer squash in a pancetta vinaigrette; 5) sweetbreads with green bean salad, potatoes, and braised bacon; 6) spice-rubbed bandera quail and beets in a roasted shallot yogurt; 7) grilled lamb with goat cheese grits, nicoise olives and carrots; 8) hazelnut chocolate crunch topped with honey nut nougat and caramel pudding.  We went over our 6-plate limit as we couldn't help it.  Can you say H-E-A-V-E-N?!  This chef is incredibly creative--I am amazed at the culinary concoctions he dares to piece together.  But that is exactly what makes something so gastronomically pleasurable.  My favorite plates were the beer-battered zucchini and mussels (they use Brooklyn lager in the batter)--the batter was incredibly flavorful but light enough so that it did not overpower the zucchini and mussels.  I also love the sweetbreads (which are thymus glands or pancreas of an animal, btw); they were battered and fried like little chicken nuggets.  Of course, the dessert was amazing: a small portion of rich chocolate with a crunch hazelnut wafer to add texture.  I normally like sweeter Belgian beers sometimes with a wheaty aftertaste so the knowledgeable and friendly bartender gave me the Allagash White.  I liked it when it hit the tongue initially but found the after taste a bit mettalic.  Next I tried the Real Ale Devil's Backbone which had less of a bitter bite at the end.  My husband (who likes IPAs and stouts) enjoyed his Real Ale Real Heavy.  The gastropub only seats about 30 people so come early to avoid a wait.  The food and drink list are phenomenal but the ambience is unpretentious.  It is the perfect mix for a good dining experience.  The decor and furniture is wooded with the occasional metal piping--all looks very industrial.  You can see the kitchen with 3 cooks at different stations and Chef finishing off the dishes before sending it out to the floor.  (My girlfriend said last time that Chef is rather cute so sit at the bar to get a good view but it's definitely warmer being next to the kitchen.)  The oven uses wood logs, giving the grilled foods a real fire smoky taste...yum.  My utmost compliments to the chef.  You must try this place.  It is in my top 10 best dining experiences."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"real neat idea, not very many places you can get sandwiches conceptualized by some of your favorite chefs around the area.

My husband and I used to eat here frequently.  We enjoyed the yummy food which was priced fairly.  The restaurant was always clean and busy.  While visiting Salem recently, we decided to stop in.  As soon as we entered, it was clearly a different experience.  The floors and tables were soiled.  The employees were the only ones sitting in the restaurant, and seemed annoyed at our arrival.  They also looked unclean.  The manager was having a loud, vulgar conversation on his cell phone at a table in the middle of the restaurant.  He was a crass and unpleasant man.   \\n\\nSadly, my former favorite menu item, the steak tip dinner was no longer offered.  Instead I ordered a slice of pizza.  My husband had a ham and cheese sub, and an order of fries, and our son had a grilled cheese sandwich.  We were told that they had only rye bread available for the grilled cheese sandwich, and reluctantly ordered one anyway.  Our food was served to us on cheap, thin paper plates, not the actual ceramic plates that Engine House used to use. The pizza slice was disgustingly greasy and soggy.  There was grease dripping down my arm as I tried to eat it.  I know pizza isn't health food, but this just tasted awful.  My husband's sandwich and fries were mediocre at best.  My son's sandwich was also incredibly greasy.  He would not eat it, and we ended up throwing it along with most of the fries in the trash where they belonged.  The food was overpriced.  We spent over $30 on food that was mostly inedible. \\n\\nI happened to visit the restroom during our visit to Engine House Restaurant.  It looked to be under construction.  There were various building supplies thrown around the restroom.  There were no soap or paper towels at the sink.  It was about as pleasant as using a port-a-potty.  \\n\\nWe were not acknowledged, thanked, or noticed by the staff other than having our food basically thrown at us.  We felt like intruders on a private party as the staff continued to socialize while we dined.  \\n\\nAs we were walking to our car, I was literally chocking back vomit.  I spent the ride home trying not to vomit up greasy old pizza that must've been sitting out too long.  I was violently ill with food poisoning all evening.  I'm thankful my son was smart enough to refuse his nasty meal.  \\n\\nBottom line: I will never dine here again, and I will be happy to tell anyone who asks me that Engine House Restaurant has become a trashy slum.

Follow that with the veal piccata (impossible to find it as good anywhere in Atlanta), or the cassoulet (perfect for a chilly evening).

I'm a late-night person and was delighted to find that a restaurant would be open until 11. However, when I arrived at 9:45, I was told that they could only do take-out at that hour. Why that would be baffles me, given that they clearly had waitstaff still there and they advertise being open until 11. If you publish that you're open until 11, you should accept guests who travel to eat at your restaurant more than an hour before you close. Period.\\n\\nWhat I like: Clearly delineated vegan options, generally robust menu, and generally flavorful food. Ordering take-out is great: it arrives quickly and they get the order right.\\n\\nWhat I don't like: While the sauces that the food come in are tasty, they mostly lack any diversity of ingredients. So, if you order chana saag, what you get is chickpeas in a spinach base - no additional veggies. Other than getting mixed vegetable curry (a great choice), pretty much everything is this way - one ingredient in one sauce. I agree with anyone else who has pointed out that their service is slow (and somewhat unfriendly as well). Restrooms are abysmal. Their booths are constructed in a flimsy way that means that, if the person in the booth next to yours leans back, it causes the backing material to hit you and forces you to lean forward.

The patty is thick but cooked to perfection and seasoned well (albeit, a bit too greasy for my liking), the cheese is melty and cheddar-y, the veggies are crisp and cut through the richness of the rest of the burger for a refreshing crunch, the bun looks so good that it could be in a commercial. Together these components come stacked together as bliss on a tray that pays you later in the form of a serious food coma. Their milkshakes are spot-on, esp the salted caramel. Their fries are well-seasoned and crispy (not as good as Shake Shack's...but close).\\n\\nNow, there's the issue of \\"the wait.\\" This isn't a place you come to if you have an instant gratification need for a quick burger. This is a place you make a trip to with a few friends when you're teetering on the edge of being hungry. As you wait your place in a line that snakes around the corner of the building, into the main dining area, and up to the cashier's, your anticipation for that first bite of burger bliss mounts. If I had to wait at any establishment for a ridiculous amount of time (it's actually not that ridiculous...maybe 1 hr from end of line to sitting at a table), it would be at Hopdoddy. Along this behemoth of a line you are given umbrellas to shield yourself from the Texas sun, staff come to take drink orders from the bar, fans and water misters shower you with cool refreshment, you stare at a menu debating the perfect burger-fry-milkshake combo, you're given your table number...and finally, you order. Remarkably, all the waitstaff are super cheerful and polite despite the chaos and hungry people all around them.

As I entered and approached the display case, I was initially disappointed because it looked as though they had completely sold out of croissants - bummer! - but was then very excited to see a whole tray of them sitting out for all to see on the counter behind the case. At this point, I happily asked the guy at the point of sale terminal for one of the croissants and was completely floored by his reply, \\"You can't have one, those are for tomorrow\\". \\n\\nI told him that I had made a special trip to Matchstick for one of those croissants (that were sitting right there staring at me!) and all I got was another \\"You can't have one, those are for tomorrow\\". I then tried to appeal to his logical sensibilities by explaining that I was a paying customer here right now, looking at the croissants right there, and that whether they sold one today or tomorrow, it really didn't matter. He just kept annoyingly repeating his mantra of \\"You can't have one, those are for tomorrow\\" and then walked away leaving me alone at the till. \\n\\nAt that point I was understandably fuming at this pedantic, \\"those are the rules\\" attitude. Firstly, the guy was refusing a potential paying customer - and for no real reason. Secondly, would it have really killed the guy to be nice to someone who had made a special trip to his store? Thirdly, don't keep the baked goods out on the counter where everyone can see them if you don't intend to sell them - it's pretty simple!\\n\\nSo, in the end, what did this \\"those are for tomorrow\\" rule accomplish? I have since found another place with equally fantastic baked goods and much friendlier, less pretentious staff - something I wouldn't have looked for otherwise. My husband, who often stopped at Matchstick on his way to work (but had had his own negative customer service experiences) figured this was the final nail in the coffin for him and likely won't go back.

We ordered:\\n\\nXiao long baos: very soupy and decent, but the skins weren't as thin as I like (i.e. Shanghai River or Din Tai Fung).\\n\\nSmoked fish appetizer (cold dish). When it comes out, the fish looks like tofu, but it was really good, with a sweet sauce and a meaty texture.\\n\\nPan fried juicy dumplings: lots of soup inside and crispy on the bottom, but I prefer the Xiao long baos.\\n\\nSaut√©ed pea tips: decent.\\n\\nSong shao fish soup: this dish tasted pretty god, especially on a cold afternoon. The bowl was enough for four. \\n\\nRice cake with salty vegetable: Rice cakes were nicely sauteed, and the veggies provided the right amount of seasoning.\\n\\nFried spring rolls: nicely fried, but a little bland.\\n\\nOverall, I was impressed with Modern City. Kerrisdale is a little far for me, but I would stop by again if I was in the area. The price is very reasonable, with the prices and food matching Dinesty."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I surprised my boyfriend on our anniversary by taking him here. Things to consider; we live in Dallas and drove 3 hours just to eat here, only to turn right back around to go back home, as we both work the next day; he is a chef at one of the nicest restaurants in Dallas and of course our 2 year anniversary. All of which was either made aware at our time of making a reservation or being seated. He has been raving about this place for a while now and just hasn't had the time with his schedule to make it down to get to physically experience it all so, this was a real special occasion for us. We have made one other special trip to Austin to do a tasting at a different restaurant where we felt like it was a truly exceptional experience and TOTALLY worth the trip. Unfortunately, tonight was not the case. Upon arrival and being seated.. Everything seemed fine. Nothing spectacular. Decor was nice but after 3 hours of driving and being greeted just like we had walked across the street.. No big deal type. It was a mediocre start to an even more standard night. Especially in comparison to our last trip.. \\"Hello Chef.. Hello (to me).. Welcome, we've been expecting you. Happy birthday! right this way please\\" chairs pushed in, hand written letter.. The works! Service here could be so much better. Watching my boyfriend expressing how excited he was about what the \\"amuse\\" may be was adorable! Only to be dampened by the first course being set as he was in mid sentence about it :/ all in all he said the food was \\"solid, nothing bad yet, nothing particularly standing out\\" although I saw him write some notes and kind of mumbling that he'd like to play with some ideas at home but, for the price, the drive, the occasion.. We'd like to be wowed.. In some way shape or form. Whether by food, service, or overall atmosphere.. Feeling special or taken care of on this special trip. Or God forbid all of the above. None of which came to fruition. He got the beverage pairing. Said it wasn't on point and left unhappy as he wasn't buzzed in any way or \\"high on food\\". After the money spent and the 6+ hours of driving just for dinner we were both not happy.. At all! Didn't even get a happy anniversary on the way out just a couple complementary \\"how was everything\\"s. The best part of the experience was when I made the reservation. Let the hostess know where we were coming from and what he did for a living, she was excited and welcoming! I made a special request saying that he would love if the chef could say hi at any point. It'd be nice to meet the talent behind the food for my boyfriend as this is what he does 12 hours a day 6 days a week. I figured at least that would be a highlight as we were practically in the kitchen and none but 10 feet from the chef. Being one of the last people there and to watch the chef walk right out at the conclusion of our meal.. Really just kind of completely killed it for us. I saw the bf finish the last of his drink.. Kind of angrily and get ready to leave. So sad. It would have been such a more appealing anniversary to just stay home and had invested the money at the store and have had my BF cook a crazy meal for us. We both would have enjoyed it more that way :/ going to love this pointless trip back home. Won't be back. Maybe not even to Austin. I'd hate to make the trip again just to be dissatisfied.. It's just not worth it.\\n\\nThe \\"boyfriend\\": \\nIt was a joy getting to watch the kitchen work. Everything was executed and seasoned well. The chef touched almost every disband examined before leaving the kitchen. The flow was done very well, even though, they were quite busy. There just seemed to be a lack of communication from the front of the house."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"825 Battery Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place is pretty pricey considering the food is not good at all.

By the time we had joined our wives in line after grabbing some food, they had just made it to the front after 20 minutes - and the line was still going out the door just after 9 AM on a Sunday. It's not as atrocious as some other places I've seen in other cities (and certainly nowhere close to the mayhem that was the Cronut line a few years ago), but it can still be a bit of a wait. They finally made it to the front, and we ended up with a half dozen donuts amongst the four of us. It turned out to be a bit of a snack on our drive out to the Columbia River Gorge, as well as a late-night snack.\\n\\nWhile the donuts themselves had some pretty decent puffiness to them, I was actually a bit disappointed when I took a bite - it definitely seems like the donuts have a bit less sugar than I would have thought. As such, even despite the frosting spread over the top, it ended up tasting a bit plain with each bite. Additionally, I felt that some of the frostings had flavors that didn't quite mix well together. The glazed donut was probably the one I liked the most, but the tartness of the lemon was a bit strong in my book. Nothing wrong with chowing down a lemon donut, but I don't think it's the best twist one could take on a classic flavor. We also got the blueberry bourbon basil donut - a mouthful of a tongue-twister, to be sure - and I felt that the blueberry and basil clashed a bit strongly, with the bourbon being a bit more muted. To be honest, this would probably make a fantastic cocktail, but on top of a donut? It definitely struck me as being a little off. The last one I had was the passion fruit donut, which also was a bit too strong on the bright, tart side.\\n\\nPerhaps the issue is that I'm not a big fruit donut fan - I have had a fantastic blueberry donut before, but it was definitely more subtle (and the bread itself was also blueberry-based). I just think that with a donut that wasn't as sweet as I would have liked from the get-go, it ended up tasting like you were eating donuts with fruit on top of them. The technique to distill the flavors into the frosting is great, no doubt, but I just didn't feel like it really ended up working well together. I'd come back to check out some of the other flavors, but I'm not ashamed to say that I've had donuts elsewhere that, objectively, I feel are superior to what I had here."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Sad to write a one star review but this place deserves it. \\n\\nTerrible coffee beans to begin with, and the baristi aren't consistent with the preparation of drinks.

That being said, the customer service has always been poor, and then tonight led to atrocious. There's usually long wait times of up to 30 minutes and then upon arrival, it's not ready. Grilling a piece of chicken and putting it on a pre-made salad takes that long....\\n\\nTonight, I ordered two Greek salads with chicken and an order of mozzarella sticks. I got home and realized I didn't get any dressing with the salad.  I called up immediately and was put on hold. The person picks up a minute later and I explain my situation. I was offered a refund of $1.50 for not having the dressing, $1.50 being the cost of the two missing dressings. What am I supposed to do with two salads and no dressing? I was graciously given the other option of coming back to this poor establishment to pick up the dressing that should have been put in the bag in the first place. I was told by the person that answered the phone that they were training new people and I was made out to be insensitive by not accepting the mistake and to just come back and pick up the dressing. Usually training involves a trainer, which did not exist at the point of purchase. I asked them to take some accountability for their mistake, some argument ensued, and we were still at the $1.50 standpoint. \\n\\nAnd now we get to the salad. They give this great piece of bread, nice amount of feta, and a worthy amount of chicken for the slight additional cost. I was now eating my salad after I drove back to pick up my dressing, and realized it had no tomatoes. It also had what appeared, and tasted to be, some sort of dried fruit like an apricot. Definitely a traditional ingredient in a Greek salad, and absolutely included (not) on the website ingredient list. \\n\\nJoe, if you're reading this, I expressed my concerns to your employee that answered the phone and was offered $1.50.

I have to say the food and service has gone downhill. We started our meal with their guacamole. I was looking forward to the homemade tortillas and was disappointed when the guacamole came out with pre-made and very thin tortillas. It only came with four so when the waitress asked if we wanted more I said yes and the replacement batch only came with two. They are no longer the thick and flavorful homemade ones. Then comes the meal. My friend ordered a bowl with chicken. The server brought out carne Asada and we had to wait another 20 minutes for them to fix their mistake by which time I was as almost done. Other than a simple apology there was no additional effort taken to rectify this mistake. Now on to my meal. I asked if I could get the bowl with pork and the waitress said absolutely. I saw there were other menu items with pork at the same price so figured I was alright at the price my meal was set at. When I got the bill I was rather angry. I was charged six dollars for substituting pork and two dollars for the extra tortillas. A dollar per small pre made tortilla. I would gladly pay that for the homemade ones but not that. At no time did the staff state there was an up charge especially one that was close to half my meal cost. One of the servers came around and asked if we wanted anything else. I asked for another ice tea that never came. This place was so disappointing especially since it used to be so wonderful. Go to Meri Mole.

However, from the service to the food quality it has all gone way down hill in the past year or so.\\n\\nWhen Ruths first started offering happy hour food and drinks at $7/item this became my favorite happy hour spots. They had $7 blueberry mojitos that came in large glasses and had about 8 or 9 items on the happy hour food menu.

It seemed to have many options for a meal including lasagna (my next choice), gyros, spaghetti, some unique appetizers, and home made cakes. I had a hard time picking what else I would eat because of the choices. Pizza was a safe bet, and did not disappoint.

It is not for those who count calories or worry about clogged arteries. It is definitely not for those who require nice silverware, glasses or incredibly chipper service to mend an ego at the end of a long day. \\n\\nSantarpio's is for survivors. It IS for someone who requires nothing more than various cuts of meat and pizza options on the menu for a satisfying dinner - since that's pretty much all there is. I HIGHLY recommend starting off with a kielbasa or other cut of meat as an appetizer while you wait for your pizza - just get you drooling a little. Then when the pizza comes you may continue to babble between bites about how awesome it is and why didn't you ever know about this place before. I have rarely consumed pizza the way I do here!  The wait staff may or may not check in on you - but WHO CARES, you are busy savoring your amazing slice of the pie.\\n\\nPrices are incredibly reasonable. The wait for a table, not always so much - check it out on a weekday if you can.

Dark, dreary and cold!  We opted for the bar which seemed more inviting due to better lighting.  Now to tackle that menu...  I immediately had unpleasant flashback to Cheesecake Factory visit where I developed a headache reading the 50 page menu.  BJ's menu is overwhelming and overpriced for what they offer.  They are trying way to hard.  The cheapest beer in the house was 4.95??  Oh but wait its HH the beers are all 1$ off (menu page 15 stated).  So okay we try some of their specialty brewed beers and two appetizers (I'll stick to apps when a burger is 11$).\\nSadly the disappointment continued ...  The beers were the best part of the visit, though not great they were solid (hence the one star).  The app sampler plater that we ordered \\"to try all our best apps\\" was cold and unoriginal.  I could have put this platter together gathering samples at Costco on a Saturday afternoon!  The avocado egg rolls were literally disgusting (boyfriend disposed of his bite in napkin discretely).  They were tasteless, oliy and mushy with a weird yet horrific honey sauce??  The mini burgers were better but hard to mess those up and for 10$ I will make my own.\\nWe got the check as soon as possible still hungry and thirsty.

The bits of sausage that are mixed into the gravy made it so tasty! And if you like biscuits and gravy you know the gravy makes all the difference! This gravy was to die for. The biscuits were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle! And the eggs were cooked to perfection! I left no crumb behind. The service was also fast, friendly and helpful with all of our questions. There was also a live jazz band playing that gave a fun vibe to this little corner spot! I highly recommend!

Nevertheless, the bacon was bursting with flavor. Not too salty, more savory.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was great! The space at Medina is a little bit deceiving because the front area, which is narrow and long, makes you think Medina has a small dining space. But then you're taken to the back area where the space really expands! The back area has a modern log cabin feel to it (I got that mostly from their antler decor), but it was chic. Combine this log cabin feel with big windows that let lots of light in and you've got a space that's telling you, \\"Good morning!

Both were excellent.  You can really tell the difference between good quality grass-fed beef and the cheap stuff.  I certainly don't mind paying more.  The lamb burger was kind of like a gyro, but in burger form.  It had just a little bit of that signature gamy taste, but not too much, and was finished with feta, marinated onions, and cucumbers.  Definitely a winner.  The fries are of the shoestring variety, lightly seasoned with herbs and served with a selection of three dipping sauces.

I'm not saying it doesn't work - it's just needlessly complicated.  You arrive at the restaurant and wait in line to get in.  When you get in, you wait in line at the bar and order a drink.  The server gives you a number and reserves you a table.  Then you wait in another line to order your food.  Then, and only then, do you get to sit down.  The result is that you stand in about three separate lines, and even after you sit down, there are still people standing in line around you, which is kind of uncomfortable.  There is no need for this.  They already HAVE servers that come around to the tables to take additional drink orders.  Just convert this place to table service and be done with this convoluted mess of a line system!\\n\\nBy the way, if you are like me and are incapable of accomplishing the reverse-angle street parking on South Congress, Hopdoddy does have a parking garage and will validate for up to two hours."},{"name":"Chef Hung Taiwanese Beef Noodle","address":"4151 Hazelbridge Way, Unit 2800","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Tugged away on the second floor of the Aberdeen Centre Mall, they serve one of the best Taiwanese beef noodle soup in town. \\n\\nMy favourite are definitely he Champion Beef noodles and the other one in tomato broth.

My verdict - the migas TOTALLY deserve all the hype. Tied for #1 for me amongst Austin migas. What makes these migas so good are the house made corn tortillas - both the chewy/crisp chips cooked in with the eggs and other ingredients and the fresh tortilla wrapped around the hot, tasty ingredients. (As an aside, these migas share a trait with my other favorites at Cocina de Consuela. Both cook the chips to just the right consistency, kind of al dente, like you'd find in chilaquiles, which are a close cousin of migas). Of course, it also helps that the tacos are freshly cooked to order, a fundamental to any good taco.\\n\\nLike any good migas, these don't really need salsa because the salsa's all included inside - jalapenos, tomatoes, onions and cilantro. Nevertheless, I had to try all 3 salsas and they were good. For you Taco Deli fans, Veracruz's green salsa is basically the same as La Dona. My wife concurred on the excellence of the migas. I also had a taco al pastor. It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary, especially in the shadow of the migas.\\n\\nAt $3 each, the migas tacos are almost free! Next time, I'll get two for sure, maybe even 3. There was a bit of a line when we arrived about 9:45 and it grew steadily while we waited and ate.

It felt a little heavy for me at 10 in the morning but it was still damn good. Both dishes comes with a sunny-side up eggs (you can ask for over easy, etc.) and the eggs are really good omg.\\n\\nI love that both dishes have watercress because it went really well with the rest of the spices. It's rare that a Western restaurant uses watercress in their dishes (or maybe I just haven't been going out of my Asian food sphere) and I applaud innovation so +1 star for that.\\n\\nService is quite attentive and friendly. The waiters are really busy but they'll usually help you out. Check out their menu online http://www.medinacafe.com/menus/\\n\\nI'm disappointed in myself for not trying out their lattes!

In particular, this place and Dante were both perhaps 3.5 (not that Dante is anything like Locke-Ober, but both had some hit and some miss dishes, and the hits were incredibly good). But I had higher expectations for Locke-Ober, so I round down instead of up.\\n\\nThis place is a Boston institution - open since 1875 (originally as Ober's Restaurant Parisien). Duck around the corner from Sovereign Bank and find the cute, welcoming sign in the shape of a lock(e). Go inside and you're transported to Moulin Rouge-era Paris - ornate woodwork, plush carpets, frescoed ceilings, gold walls.\\n\\nThis is one of the few Boston restaurants that has an actual dress code. \\"No hats or shorts are allowed at any time.\\" If you're wearing jeans or a T-shirt, they make you sit at the bar. \\"Athletic shoes and sandals will be evaluated on an individual basis.\\"\\n\\nWith a policy like this, in a setting like this, I was expecting top-flight service. Heck, the waiters wear tuxes. I usually really don't care about service - I'm there for the food - but this was noticeable. Our waiter asked \\"Can I get you something from the bar?\\" without noticing that there were no drink menus (or any menus at all) at our table yet. Our water glasses stayed empty for awhile at one point. It took a long time between courses.\\n\\nAnyway, about the food. My friend and I shared 3 courses x 2 people. Both apps were actually a bit gross, in my opinion. The BRUSCHETTA was made from the same rustic French country bread that comes before the food. Fine, the bread was good - but it was drenched in a cheesy sauce that made it soggy. I get annoyed with the texture of prosciutto because you can't take a bite, you have to cram the whole darn slice into your mouth, but it was fine. A few unremarkable fava beans and an unidentified (unlisted on the menu) white cheese-like substance cut into cubes accompanied on the plate. The CALAMARI were rubbery and tasted \\"off\\" somehow. The dipping sauce was pretty good (a smoky take on the usual marinara, made with sundried tomatoes instead). But the arugula salad that came with these was inedible. You take a first bite and it tastes great - but then you realize that whatever dressing is on it, is so salty that you'd be curing your intestines if you ate the whole thing.\\n\\nThe MAINS were much, much better. I had roasted duck breast. They don't ask you how you want it cooked; the chef makes up his mind about how it *should* be cooked, and that's a good thing. It was medium rare, and it was good. A nice, tender cut of meat, in slices like you often find a seared tuna dish. Served with root vegetable puree (I think it was mashed potatoes and parsnips - yum) and orange miso sauce (also yum). My friend had veal saltimbocca with shiitake mushrooms and a sauce of mascarpone, sage, and lemon zest. This was the one dish where I felt the flavors really blended into a whole greater than the sum of the parts - it was like firecrackers in my mouth.\\n\\nOur wines - a $9 cote-du-rhone and a $12 pinot noir - were delicious.\\n\\nI wish I could say that the DESSERTS were the grand finale, but alas. The dark chocolate cake with strawberries and fresh-whipped cream was pretty marvelous, but I've had this dish at other places done equally well - I feel like it's not that hard to pull off. On my profiterole filled with coffee ice cream and topped with chocolate sauce, the dough was a bit tough. It was fine, but dining at Locke-Ober, I expected more than just fine."},{"name":"Ghion Ethiopian restaurant","address":"2080 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is by far my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Atlanta and I've been to almost all of them (including Desta).

We felt rushed at the pace they were bringing out the plates - just as we had a quarter-portions worth left of one plate, they brought out the next and this continued for the duration of the meal. The tables for two are pretty small so in order to create room for the next plate, we felt like we quickly had to finish the previous one so they could take it off the table.

It was nothing close to magical. We love to dine and for as educated as we may like to think we are with food and wine, we are far from critical and hard to disappoint, but they accomplished to leave us with a sour taste in our mouth.\\nFirst we were greeted properly at the door and brought to our table. My girlfriends chair was not pulled out and we were not told who our server would be. It was 8:30 and we were one of four tables which was understantable being that it was the middle of the week and raining outside so we expected good to great service. Our server (dont know his name because he never told us) explained the specials to us properly. After discussing our plan of attack we decided to order two apps before the magical dining menu.\\n Our first course (not on the magical menu) was a \\"house specialty\\" the mushroom soup and quail breast with a port wine and cherry reduction. The soup we found to be thin and under seasoned. As for the quail, the sauce was actually very pleasing but the quail itself was over seasoned with black pepper (almost unedible).\\nOur second course (first magical course) was the escargot in puff pastry with yet another port sauce and mussels in a white wine sauce. The escargot we found to be not very flavorful due to the thick pastry coating it and the sauce reminded me of beef ravioli from another chef, chef boy-r-dee. Having a 5 year old, i know that taste! The mussels may have been the highlight of the meal if there was one. The sauce was great although the mussels themselves were over cooked.\\nOur third course (the main course) consisted of corvina and a single shrimp done in a grand marnier sauce with steamed vegetables and rice and the other was a one bone rack of lamb with chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The fish was over cooked to the point that it was black, the rice was soft and overcooked, and the dish was under seasoned. The lamb was ordered medium rare and came out medium well, the chicken was dry and over cooked, the mashed potatoes were bland, and the vegetables were \\"ok\\".\\nWe finally reached dessert telling ourselves that a french restaurant cant mess creme brulee up, but as u may expect by now it was not even close to one of our favorites. The torched sugar was burned to the point that the dish the creme brulee was served in caused the brulle to be hot on top and cold at the bottom. Now one thing my girlfriend knows is creme brulee, she orders it for dessert where ever we go and she usually will rate a restaurant simply on that! \\nOverall it was quite dissapointing and after dining at Coq au Vin and Paris Bistro i will have to put this in the back of the pack when it comes to Orlando's french restaurants. Needless to say that will be the first and last time either one of us dine there. C'est domage!"},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I live in the neighborhood and could not wait for this location to open. My husband called for a reservation for last Friday evening and we were given a choice between 5:45 and 9:30.  We took the 9:30, but decided to try our luck and head over at 7:30.  Parking was very limited and I hope the garage next door will be available to restaurant guests in the future. The hostess said that she could seat us early. We saw many open tables.  Despite this, we were seated at a long table in the center of the room alongside an already seated party of 4. My husband and I could not hear each other across the table and it was rather awkward listening to the other group's entire conversation while touching elbows in a space with many available tables.  \\n\\nAnyway, the decor is rustic-modern and has a nice warmth or coziness to it. I thought it was a nice change from the minimalist stylings of many new Austin restaurants. \\n\\nThe drink list. I do not think there was a red under $16 and the selection was limited.  Seems steep for Austin.  We settled on beer.  I do not recall what we chose, but it was good.  My husband commented that he did not like his beer served in a daiquiri glass.  I thought it was cute.  Perhaps that was his problem. \\n\\nThe menu.  In full disclosure, prior to this visit, we had been getting really tired of small plates in Austin.  They were fun years ago, but enough already. Like many small plates offerings, Barley Swine's selection pairs unusual ingredients and the servers recommend a number of plates per person.   We had trouble selecting plates because neither of us found the offerings particularly appealing.  I'm a vegetarian and he's not.  We settled on the Sunchoke plate and the Shiitake Pasta plate to start.  Delivered first was the Sunchoke dish.  I needed to sit up in my chair and peer down into the bowl to see the food.  We then started laughing. Hysterically.  The portion was so tiny.  While we have lots of experience with small plates around Austin, this was the final straw. I cannot recall cost of this dish, but it appeared to contain a few pennies worth of food; there was enough for one bite each.  Neither of us cared for it unfortunately.  Next up was the Shiitake pasta, again just enough for a bite or so each.  I did not like this dish at all.  My husband said that he felt badly for the waitress and decided to eat it and tell her that it was good.  We then asked for our check and left to get dinner elsewhere. We were starving.  I think we spent about $50 for two beers, two small plates, and tip.  \\n\\nI'm sorry Barley Swine.  I wanted to love you.  I had been looking forward to trying this vegetarian dish I've heard so much about in the last year or so.  While we might stop by for a drink, we won't be back for small plates."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"We stopped tonight to try this place. Both of us got the 2 piece and between us we had smashed potatoes/gravy, okra, butter beans and rice/gravy. The gravy had a spice I could not put my finger plus there was no salt on any of the sides. The chicken fell flat, no seasoning and soggy. Maybe it's me that doesn't get what the fuss is about with this joint. My husband will even eat all the bones if it's good fried chicken but not tonight.  Our discussion during dinner was where we could get better chicken.

It reminded me of a lot of nice bars I enjoyed in NY and it gets my vote so far.\\nFirst time we went here it was for drinks only. It was pretty crowded on a Saturday night, but we managed to find 2 seats at the dry bar. The wait for a drink was minimal and the beer selection is pretty impressive. Not like Bukowski's or Cambridge Common impressive, but it's up there. I really liked the atmosphere. It was dark, not so loud you had to yell to have a conversation, and lots of TVs for if you didn't want to have a conversation at all. \\nSecond time we went it was for dinner on a Wednesday night. It was pretty empty, but I attribute that to it being the day after Christmas. The server we had was very friendly and helpful. Service was prompt and nothing to complain about.\\nWe both ordered a cup of clam chowder, which had bacon as a topping and lots of dill. It was actually very bacon-y and dill-y, and not very clammy. But I enjoyed it, it was different.\\nI had the spicy thai chicken salad and my fiance had the chicken parm meal. Firstly, both were very good. I've gotta say tho, I like spicy food which is why I ordered it, but this was SPICY. Not jerk chicken at Redbone's spicy, but man there were  A LOT of red pepper flakes on it. I suggest that if you decide to order it and you don't like things burning mouth/lips spicy, you should ask that they only put a little shake of red pepper flakes on it. \\nThe chicken parm was really good. It came with 2 homemade breaded chicken cutlets that were really large and cooked perfectly, and the most ridiculous portion of fettucine imaginable. He actually ate the entire thing which was pretty impressive, but he was really hurting afterwards. He said it would've been smarter to eat half and take the other half home, because it was definitely 2 meals in one.\\nOverall, we had a nice meal with friendly service and a  nice atmosphere since the TVs don't really bother us. I'm definitely heading back to try more of their insanely large menu."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Tip from a Portland resident: Please skip Voodoo and come here instead!

But it wasn't all bad.\\n\\nWe ordered the Samosa Chaat (consider it a single samosa covered in chickpeas), Chicken Pakoras (which I swear aren't supposed to come out as little Indian chicken nuggets), and lamb vindaloo - my bride wanted a spicy meal without meat bones, so goat was out tonight!\\n\\nThe Samosa Chaat was excellently executed, but poorly presented - it wasn't warm throughout. The chicken pakoras were hardly a step above fast-food chicken nuggets. The lamb vindaloo saved this review from something below three stars.\\n\\nThe flavor was mostly missing - they needed to add salt. The spice - we ordered (as always) their top spice level - was perfect. It could have been spicier, but considering how vanilla the rest of this place was, we were impressed with the heat. The server (a very helpful Tom) brought us spice paste unprompted to make our samosa chaat more spicy too. The rice was well done - we love our cumin seeds!\\n\\nIn short, what the Clay Pit did was encourage me to encourage my bride to learn how to make vindaloo at home so we can never be disappointed again.\\n\\nOne note: I'm always impressed when an Indian place has the little bowl of colored spice seeds on the way out. This place did, which also helped earn the three stars (though I forgot to get some on the way out!!!)\\n\\n+ spice\\n+ service\\n\\n+/- flavor\\n\\n- not well-heated food\\n- chicken nuggets"},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"718 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Stay away from this place had horrible service...the girls that work the line all have an attitude....

We stopped on the way out and told the manager that the food was great, but that he especially should have the employees to wear gloves. He gave us a small smile and thanked us for coming. \\n\\nLet's hope he realized the importance of this. I plan to revisit Flip, and I hope that they have enforced the glove policy at that point. I would have given them 5 stars if it had not been for this."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Fiance and I visited on Friday night; the wait for a table at around 7 PM was only 15-20 minutes, but we snagged two seats at the bar almost immediately. Also almost immediately, we saw Chef Blais walking around and gladhandling. He needs a haircut.\\n\\nThe menu is divided into beef and non-beef burgers, and sides are a la carte.  The burgers aren't mini, but they're not full-sized either, so the idea is to get 1-2 per person (though one bartender confessed that she watched a guest devour 5 in one sitting).  We started with 2 burgers and 2 sides. The pork belly and cheese burger ($7.50), which was Flip's play on a bacon cheeseburger, was tasty and perfectly cooked (which is funny, because the server didn't ask how I'd like it done-but it came out rare to medium rare, which suits me just fine), but I really couldn't taste the pork belly. The pickled cukes were a highlight of the toppings, which also included onion, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, and mayo. The shrimp po boyger ($8.50) was amazing-the patty had great texture, and the fried lemon and Old Bay mayonnaise were lovely compliments. In terms of sides, the vodka-battered onion rings ($4) were wonderfully crunchy, with just the right proportion of batter to onion. The remoulade dipping sauce was nice, too. The sweet potato tots ($4.50), while tasty, were WAY WAY WAY oversalted. The portion was also fairly small for the price (I didn't have either of those complaints with the onion rings).\\n\\nWe were still a little hungry, so we ordered the codfish burger ($8.50) and a Krispy Kreme shake ($7). Sadly, the shake came out first. Well, only the timing was sad-the shake was happy, happy, happy! I mean, it tasted EXACTLY like the iconic glazed donut. Except better, because it was frosty and creamy. Strange how Chef Blais took something so delicious when hot, and turned it into a fabulous chilly treat. Bravo.  The cod burger was very good, though I could have done with less tartar sauce and my fiance could have done with less of the pea shoot salad.\\n\\nService at the bar was mostly good, though one bartender clearly outshone the other. Beer selection was decent, but I found the wines to be unvaried and overpriced. For example, there were only 5 red and 5 whites by the glass, and a glass of Hess chardonnay went for $12 (which is more than I've paid for a bottle of the same in some instances). I'll stick with the suds until they start playing around with crazy cocktails.\\n\\nI think this place is going to explode.  It's an interesting concept.  Its price point is relatively reasonable. It's family friendly. It's going to be awesome in the warmer weather when they can open their patio. It's definitely going into my regular rotation!"},{"name":"Giuseppe's Ritrovo","address":"2268 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This is one of my very favorite restaurants in town and long due a good review from me.  It is a perfect place to go when you want to feel important.  \\n\\nThe list of things Giuseppe and his crew do right is too long for this review, but I will highlight the top:\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\n\\nGrowing up in an east coast Italian household, Giuseppe's (the chef) palate and look resemble my family back in New York.  I have yet to eat anything here that I haven't enjoyed.  I love the arugula salad, the eggplant parm is delicious.  The gnocchi pesto is nice although I always need to salt and pepper it.  Sometimes I order a plate of al dente rigatoni with a lone meatball.  I had a terrific short rib with a jus reduction plus mushrooms and gnocchi.  Wonderful!  I made sure to eat it slow.  My only sour note about the food is they serve lousy rolls.  I would prefer a really good slice of Italian bread or the option of paying a few bucks for a small bread basket with Omega bakery Ciabatta and Rustic French.  Aside from that, the menu spans a wide range to make anyone happy.  The specials are usually interesting and inspired, and the happy hour fare is also nice!\\n\\nAlso worth noting, the silverware is heavy, and feels perfect in the hand.  I cannot for the life of me understand why places like Sage (closed) serve a beautiful (and expensive) meal with Wasserstroms $1 diner silverware.  Clothing for a hot date, would you freeball, or worse yet, put on your pair of moth-holed white Hanes undies under a nice pair of Brioni slacks?  I sure as hell wouldn't.  The silverware is the underwear of the table, and Giuseppe's sports the Michael Kors, which is the right decision on such occasion.\\n\\nTHE WAIT STAFF\\n\\nThis is a subject I could write a whole book on.  While dining in a nice restaurant, I want one of two things, preferably both.  I either want a totally hot waitress/waiter (see Brania or Francesco), or someone totally funky looking/acting with an amazing personality who knows the fuck out of the menu (someone in likeness of chef Giuseppe).  Luckily at Giuseppe's, the wait staff is both attractive AND knowledgable.  What I despise is a meal at a joint on par with Giuseppes where the wait staff looks like they are on the cast of Hee Haw, add to that... no passion, pride, or knowledge of the menu.  And you can unfortunately find that exact problem at most restaurants in town.  Average service belongs at Best Buy or First Watch.  To be fair, this is really a management issue, but I don't really care who foots the blame, I want hot, funky, and knowledgable!  The wait staff's purpose is to hustle me into an experience (which will cost me a lot of money), one I should not forget because in Columbus, there's a plethora of competition for my restaurant dollars.\\n\\nThe bar is excellent, headed by smooth talking Sean, a perfect mixologist maestro. \\n\\nTHE ATMOSPHERE\\n\\nWhere in town can you grab a delicious semi formal dinner, and hear \\"Some Girls\\" on the speakers?  In Bexley, no less?!?!  And on Mondays, Kris (resident art photographer) runs a free jazz night that plays covers spanning jazz classics to Nirvana to Dolomite's Eat Out More Often opening self titled tune.  Amazing!  A reminder, in Bexley!  Giuseppis is the rare restaurant in the burbs where you sit intimately next to your neighbor, where you can freely converse about culinary recommendations without people reaching for the red button, despite being located in snobville.\\n\\nAll in all, this is my favorite Italian restaurant in Cbus, aside from a tie with John Dorn's Basi Italia in Vic Village (which I also love deeply).  The second time I went to Giuseppe's I was greeted by recognition, possibly by name.  This matters to me.  This is the art of service, a beautiful profession that people used to take pride in.  Giuseppe's preserves that tradition here.  I get the impression that the team Giuseppe's loves their respective jobs as well as their patrons.  I have closed this place down a few times over espresso driven conversation with Giuseppe and Kris.  Lovely!\\n\\nIt's home, it's delicious, and it's worth every penny!\\n\\n~ Keida Mascaro"},{"name":"Anna Bannanas NW","address":"1214 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"New owners!

About the time we were done eating fixes came for our meals brought by a manager (I think).  No apology for the mistake and a \\"your welcome\\" for bringing more food than we ordered?  Not too impressive given my burger cost $14.  When the waiter brought the check, out of courtesy I said \\"Thank You\\" and got a \\"You Bet\\" in return.   We spent $80 not including a tip.

I tried (i can't remember the name of it) a huge chocolatey donut dessert and nearly fell off my bar stool. It was GINORMOUS! I could not finish it, but it hit the spot and I was happy I had ordered it. As for the bar, I love the decor- I can barely tell Kerby Lane used to be there and that is a good thing! It feels cozy and romantic and I really like making out with my husband here. Usually we do our drinking and kissing at night but sometimes we start earlier in the day- we like early bird specials ; ) But the problem with doing this drinking and kissing earlier and at a bar that sells donut meals is that KIDS are also at these establishments. (SO, the one thing I hate about Austin is all the damn people with their damn kids hanging out in bars, UGHHH!). If my dog isn't allowed in a bar then neither should a person under 21 years of age. I will not de-star Gourdough's for allowing kids but it sure does upset adults like myself that like to drink and do adult things and then have to curb said adult behavior because a 5 year old is at the next table."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Being an \\"Austin\\" or an \\"Austiny\\" institution is not what it appears to be on the surface.\\n\\nIt's NOT simply slapping together a bunch of old , vaguely vintage items into a room - or throwing hubcaps up everywhere - or using old, wrinkled posters to line cracked walls - or having waiters who have dreads and wear faded t-shirts.

Gourdough's pub house managed to be clean without being sterile, orderly without being posh, and comfortable without being messy.

(It'd be nice if fries were offered, to be honest, but I LOVED the sprouts).  Don't be scared by the idea of the \\"Donut\\" burger - the donuts are savory, delicious things that work perfectly with a beef patty (my husband was home sick, so I get major wife points for letting him have the burger half i took home - he loved it!). \\n\\nFor dessert, I convinced my friend with an older boyfriend named Harry to get the \\"Dirty Harry\\" (we all giggled) and I got the salty balls (more giggles).

I  ended up bailing at the last minute.\\nSince then I've always had that 'what if..?' pang of doubt in the back of my mind. Not for the person, but the hedonist in me wondered if I'd given up a delicious lunch opportunity. I like Chambar (sister restaurant) and had heard nothing but good things about this place as well.\\n\\nSo when my current partner suggested we grab brunch here today, I was enthused. \\nThe location is good-- we found parking across the street without issue. Nice decor, and a good provision of seating for a cafe. Would not call it cozy, but the atmosphere was undeniably friendly, and energetic. The servers seemed genuinely pleased to be working.\\nAlas, brunch ends at 12 and we didn't get there until half-past, but the entire menu looked so appealing that settling for lunch was hardly a regret. (The brunch menu also has some items that are available all day, and our server let us know that side orders could be accommodated if were absolutely set on brunch.)\\nI ordered the Lavender Latte (good) and the Curry du jour, (Eggplant, bamboo, coconut, chicken, rice) which was so yummy that I ate the entire thing. (Big portion too!) \\nMy partner eats Paleo, and was pleased to see a number of options that would have worked for him.

The appetizer (a cheese plate) was somewhat small for the price, but the quality/freshness of the cheeses were superb and I didn't mind as much.  The entrees were also just as good in quality and taste.  I ordered the Gnocchi alla Panna, cause I usually like to keep it simple at Italian places.. Fettuccine Alfredo is my usual go-to dish, and this plate seemed to fit the bill (\\"Potato dumplings in a fontina cream sauce\\").  I was pleasantly surprised that this dish was anything but simple.. it was the best cheesy, mouth-watering deliciousness I've had to date.  I'm salivating just thinking about it!  \\n\\nThe vibe of the restaurant was somewhere between chic and relaxed, to almost snooty.  I can't really explain why..

It is in a super random place and really casual but fantastic. It's Haitian food and it is awesome. For anyone who has never had Haitian food it is kinda similar to Caribbean food with slightly different, more robust flavors. In fact, I think that Haitian food has ruined me a little bit for Latin food as I find that Haitian sauces and flavors tend to be more to my liking.  Some of it can be spicy if you are a wimp like me but there is plenty of diversity. Their plantains are my favorite I have ever had and I love the chicken creole. Also try the conch and the griot which is baked/fried pork and is addictive.  Basically everything I have seen anyone order has been fantastic.

The atmosphere and mood in the place is nice as was stated by several people.  The waiter was very nice and accommodating, even though we sent back two dishes.  Not because they were bad but because they just not what we were expecting.  Let me explain.  \\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered 3  - Veggie Samosa - Curry Mussels - Curry Crab cake..  Also, ordered the Garlic Naan and the Spinach and Paneer Naan.  I also had a Mango Margarita which was deli-sh! The samosa and crab cake were okay, a little heavy and greasy but we enjoyed them.  The mussels were outstanding and I got the rest of the sauce in my bowl to go and will make a shrimp dish with it at home :)  \\n\\nEntrees:  I ordered the Vindaloo with lamb and my girlfriend got the Mirch Masala with beef.  It came with jasmine rice.  The portions came in these small two handled metal bowls.  We looked at each other and said, \\"Really?,  for 14. and 15. and the portion is this small\\"  If we had not ordered that huge amount of appetizers we would have left hungry!  But, since we had already been stuffed by naan and appetizers we didn't complain.\\n\\nThe vindaloo was a bit sweet for me.  It tasted eeehh okay and my girlfriend preferred my dish to hers but I was looking for savory without that background of sweetness.  The waiter was very courteous and even took the blame himself by saying he should have mentioned which curry dishes were sweet.  He swapped it out for Lamb Roganjosh which was better and more what I was expecting.  I only tasted it because I was stuffed on naan and the appetizers.  But, the lamb on both dishes was excellent tasting and very tender.  I had ordered both dishes very hot and with the Vindaloo I could barely read the heat but the Roganjosh delivered the heat I was looking for.  My girlfriend's beef dish was just okay as well.  Oh yeah, both naan's were excellent!  I couldn't stop dipping them in sauce :)\\n\\nEven though we were stuffed to the gills, we did dessert.  My girlfriend got the Mango Cheesecake and I got the Thai Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend sent the cheesecake back because she said it was not heavy and dense like a traditional cheesecake and seemed like it had whipped air or something but she did not like the texture.  She swapped for chocolate cake to go.  Since I had gotten my Lamb Roganjosh to go, I ate my dessert which was deli-sh.  It had that perfect ratio of almost burnt tasting hard sugar on the top and the creamy faintly Thai Tea tasting creamy goodness underneath.  Again, small portion but deli sh,\\n\\nI spent 80. + tip on 3 appetizers, 1 drink, 2 entrees and 2 desserts.  I think that is a bit high.  I would give it 4 stars because of the service and ambiance, but  I have to give it 3.5 stars.\\n\\nThe best thing I had all night was the mussels.

On our arrival, we found four friendly young men (very friendly...their loud banter echoed off the walls the whole time we were there) who, though employees, knew next to nothing about the restaurant. \\"We're new,\\" they laughed, as if that excused 1. Being out of quinoa, 2. Not knowing what soups were available, 3. When asked about the potato soup, couldn't say what was in it, and 4. Being out of essential smoothie ingredients. Not an promising beginning, but we ordered. Salad, soup, and tea for me; sandwich, fruit, and smoothie for my friend. \\nThe sandwich and fruit came first: a sad-looking meal, unadorned, on a red plastic plate. I don't know what was in the sandwich, but the fruit, seved in a tiny plastic cup with a plastic seal (obviously not made fresh), looked suspiciously like canned fruit cocktail. \\nMy salad consisted of chopped lettuce, obviously from a bagged grocery store mix, topped with little chicken dices (picture Tyson frozen chicken strips, cut up) shredded carrots, and a drizzle of Thai dressing. And the potato soup, OMG. Served in a styrofoam cup with a tiny plastic spoon, it consisted of potato chunks and shredded carrot in a lukewarm, watery base. I can attest to it's not being freshly made because I saw it come  out of a freezer in commercial packaging. I still shudder  when I think of it. \\nIn addition to the really awful quality of the food, almost nothing in the place was environmentally friendly, which I was disappointed in, since I associate eating healthy (although this was not) with caring about the world around us.\\nThe young men said they'd been open since May.

Customer Service was excellent - as usual!\\n\\nWe are no strangers to this place and upon occasion do enjoy visiting for a good meal and superior Customer Service.\\n\\nWell, this past visit... we left less than happy with what we were served.  My husband ordered the Big Buzz Mac N Cheese Tavern with the bottomless fries and of course requested the Campfire sauce.  I know full well that the food we are served never looks as good as the pictures that advertises said food but this one was a bit extreme.  First off the lettuce was brown and wilted.  Secondly, the amount of Macaroni and Cheese on this burger was pretty much a joke.  The waitress said, they were preportioned, so  I am thinking they split this in three to conserve, they ran out, they scraped it off another dish, or they are just blind!\\n\\nMy hubby is a big fan of the bottomless fries and always requests the Campfire sauce with it - which is no additional charge.  The fries were fresh as usual and our waitress was very attentive to make sure he was not wanting for more.  If you have not tried the Campfire sauce, I suggest you do so. Its lighter than BBQ sauce, not as heavy, and creamy with a bit of smokey sweetness- its very delicious.\\n\\nOur waitress was very pleasant and went to get some more Mac N Cheese for my husband to put on his burger so he could at least taste it.  Management came by and offered to replace the lettuce when I mentioned it was brown.  I think they saw me taking photos and were trying to be proactive... not sure.\\n\\nOther than those two complaints, it was ok. He did say he would probably not order it again, but it was edible.  \\n\\nI ordered the Simply Chicken sandwich with no bun - wedgie style.  I LOVE that this is offered here as I am really unable to digest bread very well.  This item comes with the option of bottomless fries or bottomless freckled fruit salad - which is generally an additional cost to substitute- but not with this meal. Loved that! \\n\\nOk, so the chicken was ok, nothing to write home about for sure - thin and a bit salty.  Usually when I encounter a place I can sub the bread for lettuce and they do a wrap with it - the protein is wrapped - and generally with good quality lettuce and proportioned to the filling.  Red Robin could use a lesson from these other establishments...   \\n\\nThe lettuce was iceberg, ok, I get that - but it was the white part of the lettuce head which was quite bitter and there were layers upon layers. The lettuce under and over the chicken, as it was not wrapped, stacked higher than my husbands big burger.  I think I paid for a lettuce plate lol. \\n\\nI requested their homemade Ranch dressing and was pleasantly surprised.  Typically I do not like Ranch dressing as too many places use bottle dressing and I only like it homemade.  Well this was homemade and super creamy without being overly seasoned. It balanced well and I was happy to have ordered it.  \\n\\nThe Freckled fruit salad was pretty good. I understand its not the season for much fresh fruit but was again pleasantly surprised at the variety of fruit there was in the bowl; strawberries, pineapple, apples, and mandarin oranges. I really enjoyed this also.\\n\\nThe service was super amazing and if I was not so bad remembering names, I would definitely recognize the nice young lady who helped us - and listened to our complaints with a smile.  She rocked it!\\n\\n\\nGiven the few issues with the meal, this visit I have to rate 3 stars.

Both the leg and thigh were moist and hot, but hot in a good way.  I enjoyed every bite of that chicken.  The mashers and gravy were also really good.  The coleslaw was ok, but that's fine, the other items made up for it.  The biscuit was humongous and the butter was such a surprise that my wife laughed at my expression of surprise and enjoyment when I took my first bite.  \\n\\nMy wife had the cornbread and onion rings which she said were both really good.

I've been looking forward to coming here since they just opened recently and seemed to have a nice new interior and a wide menu. \\n\\nThe experience was less than stellar though, which I attribute mainly to the food.  I chose to keep it simple on my first visit and opted for a Hamburger and mixed salad, and my friends tried the onion soup, white truffle macaroni and cheese and a jalapeno stuffed burger. Well, the burger gets my award fot the worst I've tried for 2007- it was small and burned to a crisp, and I mean burned so badly it crunched everytime I took a bite. If I overlook that it was overcooked, it was very small and seemed like it was no more than a 1/4 pound if I'm being generous. Very dissapointing...However the fries were crisp and plentiful. Unfortunately the large pickle accompanying the burger was painfully soggy and a bit warm. The salad was fresh and chilled.\\n\\nAs for my friends dishes: the onion soup was extremely salty and the macaroni and cheese was a bit soupy and gritty. We ended the meal with what turned to out to be the highlight: a chocolate cake with ice cream. The cake itself was pretty mushy and spent too much time in a microwave, but the two scoops of Ice Cream accompanying it was surprisingly excellent.\\n\\nService was fine, with a friendly waitress, however there were long waits between orders and deliveries. The decor is fine for what it is, with a typical modern Boston sports bar interior. Although the back of the bar with large windows facing into a small mall give me the feeling that I am indeed sitting in a mall, which doesn't give me the warm cozy tavern feeling.\\n\\nThis is a solid 3 stars for me.

The plates were traditional both in style and flavor, a detail I can easily see some American not understanding. Plates ranged from $3 up to $12 and the selection of Paella's were $30 and $35. We got many including several types of croquettes, Spanish sliced ham called Iberico Ham, Potatoes Bravas, a kind of bruschetta and lamb meatballs. The croquettes came 2 per order each slightly smaller than a golf ball, for $6 an order. They were perfectly made, cheesy, hot and perfectly browned. The bruschetta like thing was toast rubbed with garlic and tomato then generaously seasoned  and doused with olive oil, I can see many people complaining about its minimalism but it was perfect. The best were the shrimp cooked in garlicky oil your choice of spicy or not. We got both and the spicy were as advertised. Holy Toledo! But they were so tasty. Last we got the Fidua, think paella but with broken angel hair pasta instead of Valencia Rice. The seafood was cooked perfectly and the flavors were big, really big. This is where some locals might be turned off, but I know this dish from my travels and I can tell you it was sublime. We shared a bottle of Rioja for $35, I thought the prices were reasonable. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the staff, they were extremely professional for such a small place and they worked in unison with little chatter. Even though our waiter was young he was familiar with the menu and was attentive to all the steps of service expected at a nice place. I was so blown away by this place, I will be back. All done dessert and all we spent $150 plus the tip, but we tried a lot of dishes and we left beyond satisfied, dare I say full. By the time we got up every table was seated and there was a party waiting for a table at the door, this was a Monday night mind you.  Pepe, you have hit a Home Run here!

None of us had ever been here before so going off the opinions of other yelpers we ordered:\\npork belly buns: as far as pork belly buns go these were definitely good. They weren't however something I feel the need to order again.\\n\\ntea smoked ribs: Had the highest expectations for these and I was not disappointed. They didn't taste anything like I thought they would but were delicious, tender, and fell right off the bone.\\n\\nshort rib soft tacos: this was actually the only dish i did not really care for. I guess asian fusion doesn't really fuse well with mexican classics.\\n\\npanko crusted lemon chicken: I didn't even want to order this but after trying it I'm glad we did. It was a nice change of pace from all the other spicy dishes and the lemon was clearly fresh squeezed and refreshing.\\n\\npork and chive pot stickers: these were good, definitely not the best potstickers I've had but good nonetheless. Huge complaint, for whatever reason no one I was with could keep the meat inside the wrapper for the life of them. I've eaten a lot of potstickers and I've never seen the dough break apart like this before.\\n\\ndan dan noodles: These were great. Cold noodles with a slightly spicy peanut sauce.

I liked these a lot.\\n\\ngenami fried rice: overall I liked this rice, it was spicy and came loaded with various vegetables and things. There was something in it though that was extremely bitter and unpleasant when you got a bite of it.\\n\\nOverall this was a very enjoyable and different dining experience. I liked the open kitchen set up where I could see the cooks at work. Next time I would definitely try to get a seat at the bar in front of the kitchen so I could see exactly how they were preparing the food.

The dan-dan noodles were alright and the Genmai fried rice was great, but the spicy chili sprinkled on top seemed to be an afterthought.  The tea-smoked ribs were dry and tasted slightly bitter.

My dad mentioned we were studying German and how interested they were in their restaurant and they actually invited us into the kitchen to meet Otto and Anita! They were all so kind. \\n\\nThe main thing I love is the dill pickle soup (yum) their rolls (OMG) and Anita's pastries. Everything has so much flavor it's incredible!

From a conversation I had with the waitress and then a follow up call with the manager I was told the waitstaff doesn't carry change so they round up the bills.

The atmosphere is nice.  The food average to above average.  The pricing isn't  cheep but reasonable for a Boston Restaurant.

EVERY TIME I've ordered pizza here the pizza is so undercooked that the toppings almost always come off as soon as you try to remove it from the box, and that is with the hand tossed crust. The pan crust is delivered raw and doughy , so it's definitely not an option. I've had to ensure my husband stops ordering from here since the pizza is never cooked thoroughly. \\nThe only redeeming factor is that they have a couple of ingredients that other places dont(i.e. Peruvian chili peppers and drizzles). Other than that, I would never order here. \\nAs a teenager I worked for Pizza Hut in another state, and the quality was very good. I know the temperature that the ovens were set for and can remember how long it took to cook them, so it makes me wonder if this location undercooks in order to get the pizza out faster? I do know they don't seem to care and have no idea what quality means.\\nWe have tried everything possible to eliminate the problem, like only getting 1 topping, no drizzle, light sauce, and change of crust. But it always comes in the same-slimy crust that wasn't cooked through. \\nWe've stopped ordering from here and taking our business to their competitors for the most part, but last night we ordered here because of price. I was hoping to give them one last slice. And as usual, I wasn't pleasantly disappointed. Pizza toppings slid right off of my husbands first slice, and my slice was slimy.\\nThe people running the restaurant don't seem to care about their customers, judging by all of the complaints on here and other sites-so I'm not only going to be in contact with their manager, but also the corporate office. So that even though I will never order here again, hopefully other possible customers might get better quality pizza.  If this doesn't work, I truly urge anyone reading this to do what I'm doing-that way, either corporate will either fix it or no business will.\\nAs for me, I will be taking my business and money to the competition from now on.

My Barley Swine review. \\n\\nAfter showing up here after a play at Zach Scott, and discovering it is closed on Sundays...\\n\\nAfter watching Anthony Bourdain and the indie band Ume inexplicably eat chicken testicles here on \\"'No Reservations: Austin\\"...\\n\\nAnd after months of teasing and cajoling from my fellow Yelpers every single time we got together, because I have--for some insane reason--NOT had the pleasure of eating at this restaurant...\\n\\n...Errol M. had had enough, and to save me from all of this, we spontaneously decided at an earlier ROTDC to meet here Saturday evening, and end this crippling Barley Swine barrenness in my life once and for all.\\n\\nWe arrived at 5:15, believing they opened at 6. But on a Saturday it happened to be at 5. Therefore, they were already full, and our wait for \\"2 at the bar\\" would be 60-90 minutes. No matter. A wait at Barley Swine is to be expected; Errol even believes it adds to the anticipation. He pointed out there were a ton of different places to go to kill the time: wine and cheese at Henri's next door; coffee at Opa's merely steps away, or even Lick Ice Cream, if you're a \\"dessert first\\" kind of person. We opted for Opa's, and one iced coffee and a spanikopita later, we were texted that our seats were ready.\\n\\n(Side note: I think we were lucky we hit it during the UT-West Virginia game, as that culled some of the potential dining crowd. I also pointed out in my check-in that I was unofficially tailgating, too. But Nathan-style...with wine and foie gras, naturally.) \\n\\nThe space is simultaneously warm and intimate, yet without any sort of gimmicks or pretentious decor. It was vastly smaller than I expected, and can only seat around 40 people at a time. Errol explained that for a first-timer, a seat at the bar is preferred, especially if you want to get acquainted with the food without having to do so while seated \\"family style\\" next to strangers. Although to my credit, Errol insisted I was gregarious and fun-loving enough to where not only could I handle a table of other diners, I'd probably end up being elected their unofficial leader, and then proceed to hold court for the remainder of the evening. \\n\\nThere is a reason I was partial to the selection of Errol as my Barley Swine guide: as a well-respected and well-known regular, he knows people. And by people, I mean the INCREDIBLY friendly and amazing staff that includes the sweet and charming likes of Billy, Cassie, and Melissa...all who not only welcomed Errol back, but embraced me--not as if I were a newcomer--but as if I were a new best friend. Our reception and the subsequent service we received left me with one of the best impressions of customer service in the restaurant industry...ever. \\n\\nThe menu reads like a cacophony of innovative and fascinating flavor combinations, and really, you should just make it easy and order everything. Errol decided that for two people to share, 6 savory plates and 2 sweet plates were the perfect combination. With a bright smile, Billy promised we would be having all the best plates coming our way. \\n\\nThat included:\\n\\nSoft poached duck egg, zucchini salad, popcorn, goat cheese (An excellent starter, a variety of textures and flavors)\\n\\nRedfish, brioche, smoked ham grits, turnip, apple (I could eat an oil drum of those smoked ham grits; the fish was cooked beautifully)\\n\\nSweet potato, chipotle, house made bacon, Oktoberfest pecans, meyers lemon (It was the first cold day after summer; and this dish tasted like autumn on a plate; Billy said it was Barley Swine personified)\\n\\nScrambled egg, blue crab, english muffin, papaya, avocado (A less heavy, more refreshing selection)\\n\\nRabbit, schnitzel, rabbit tenderloin, shishito pepper, radish, chanterelle mushroom (Delectable, esp. the intensely savory tenderloin)\\n\\nCrispy stuffed pig ankle, foie gras, pinto beans, hot sauce (My favorite, and Errol correctly dubbed it the deconstructed version of pork and beans; for me, seared foie gras is always a winner) \\n\\nHefeweizen doughnuts, smoked pork ice cream, whiskey, fermented chile (Excellent soft doughnuts; however, we agreed the pork ice cream was perhaps \\"one toke over the line\\")\\n\\nOlive oil mousse, meyer lemon, parsley sorbet, chickpea cookie (A light, subdued, and superb finish to our parade of amazing plates)\\n\\nThe menu changes rapidly and constantly. If the above plates are not on there...clearly, you are still guaranteed other fantastic selections.   \\n\\nEvery new plate was explained thoroughly by the staff. All of the action--and all of the focus--is right there behind the bar, where I could watch the talented chefs turn out every beautifully-plated and exquisitely-combined dish. Also, little touches such as folding your napkin when you leave to the restroom all worked in tandem to send this visit into an entirely different dimension of restaurant dining. \\n\\nThank you, Errol! This wouldn't have been the same without you.\\n\\nAnd thank you, Barley Swine. \\n\\nSeriously. \\n\\nYou deserve 10 Stars."},{"name":"Thai Lagoon Bistro","address":"888 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"The best thing about this place is the hospitality.  \\nAte here becuase we made the mistake of booking the hotel. \\nThats another review.\\nThe food was ok.

On a fairly empty Monday lunch time it took an inordinate amount of time to prepare the basic and common Speedy Gonzalez and when it did arrive, the \\"crisp\\" taco was soggy and fell apart when I lifted it.  The enchilada was uninspired, the beans bland, and greasy fingerprints on my platter only added to the experience.

For relatively basic fare, everything was delicious and nothing felt overpriced given the quality, and the cocktails were fantastic.  It's not the greatest place you'll ever try, but if you're in the neighborhood and looking for food and drinks, it's worth checking out.\\n\\nFood\\nI ordered the Campbell and my date got the Bristol.  Both sandwiches were larger than we expected and really delicious.  Mine came with a small side salad of cucumbers and tomatoes in balsamic that complimented the sandwich nicely, and overall the flavor was great.  We saw another table get an order of onion rings that looked delicious so we ordered a half order - those I would say are worth skipping, nothing very special.  Overall, the food was pretty good.\\n\\nCocktails\\nI tried an Oxley Spritz and a Watermelon Margarita.  My date got a Swift Water and liked it so much she had another.  The Oxley Spritz was fantastic, nice subtle cucumber notes, and not overpowering the less Gin-y flavor of the Oxley.  The Watermelon Margarita was not nearly as good, being more tart than I would have liked.  The Swift Water had a nice lemonade-y sweetness to it without being overpowering, and seemed like the kind of drink you could get in fun trouble with.\\n\\nDecor\\nI mention this only because we ate outdoors and I was favorably impressed.  Parish Cafe has a large out-door seating area, and it's not crowded or overly difficult to move around in.  That was nice enough that I thought it was worth a mention.\\n\\nService\\nService was largely unremarkable, except for the outside host who had a great sense of humor.

They are located near the shop with hanging pinatas and another food truck nearby. The lot looks sketchy but just park and walk toward the white school bus. Their menu is pretty big, you can customize certain tacos. The prices threw me off because it's pricey for street tacos but you'll see why in a little bit. I asked the lady how big the tacos were since one taco was about $3, and she made them seem like they weren't too big. I ordered two with the thought of coming back and ordering more if I was still hungry. Man, was I wrong. \\nI ended up getting 2 al pastor tacos on flour. Another perk about this place is that they don't charge you extra for flour. They don't charge you for not eating it authentically! They give you a beeper and you can wait and eat at picnic tables nearby. There are even porta-potties so don't stress that you're eating at a food truck. It didn't take too long, once it beeped, you pick up your tacos at the other end where all the sauces were. The tacos were HUGE. They were each wrapped in foil paper to keep them warm and I didn't even time to take a picture after opening up the foil. These tacos were the biggest street tacos I have ever seen and the size of the pieces of pork were giant cubes. It is definitely worth the $3. The al pastor does stain your hand so have hand sanitizer handy or you can grab some near the sauce. This place looks out for you. \\nThey also have a wide drink menu. We tried cucumber juice which is super fresh and light. We also tried the mango juice and strawberry smoothie. They all tasted super good and come in large containers.

Squeeze the pipette to inject the Cointreau into the donut and let it sit for a minute to infuse the donut with boozey goodness. There's also the Blueberry Bourbon Basil which actually tastes like all those things as a complex wave of flavors roll over the palette, you can actually taste the bourbon notes. \\n\\nI'm sure I'd have great things to tell you about these donuts if I was ever allowed to eat a whole one to actually be able to comment on mouth feel and texture rather than just having been teased to the brink of climax with the thought of a whole donut, then left with some culinary equivalent of blue balls.\\n\\nI hate this place and I hate everyone I've ever gone with that made me share my donut.\\n\\nOne day when I get to eat an entire blueberry bourbon basil donut, I will write a novel that will rival Moby Dick in detail that will make the 32 pages describing the wale's blowhole seem fleeting in comparison!

My boyfriend and I decided to come here for Valentine's Day after hearing everyone rave about how amazing it was. We were running late to our reservation but the staff was very friendly and accommodating even though it was a busy night. The restaurant is dimly lit (too dim for photos without flash) but very lively. I love this kind of atmosphere because you can chat with your date comfortably rather than whisper like you might at other quieter restaurants. I'm not sure if they bring bread to the table automatically, but we needed to ask for it. The bread was warm and crusty with a soft center -- so good!! Our server was also very friendly and helpful. \\n\\nWe ordered tapas to share: grilled hanger steak, farroto, and grilled pulpo. Since we were at a Spanish wine bar, we figured we should also try the seafood paella and sample their wine. My glass of Riesling was great and my boyfriend enjoyed his glass of Sauvignon blanc as well. They also had their wine sommelier in for the night, which was cool to see him help the couple next to us. The food was delicious. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and well-seasoned. The pulpo was a bit too salty but it was so tender -- you never would've been able to tell it was octopus because it wasn't chewy at all. The mushroom farroto, a risotto made with farro, was probably my favorite of the night. It was creamy and cheesy without being too heavy. Note about the paella: we assumed the paella would automatically be for two since it says minimum two servings in the menu, but were surprised it was one instead because we hadn't specified. We were fine with having just one serving because it was quite large but if your party wants multiple servings, you should specify to the server! There was a very generous amount of seafood, mostly mussels and clams. To finish the meal, we shared the flan and a glass of port. The flan was delicious and just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy our sweet tooth. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend Barcelona for date night or a night out with friends!

Seems like pretty standard fried rice with pork and pineapple and a bit of nasi goreng flavor. \\n- Kimchee Quinoa Bokkeumbap with Bulgoki: Pretty different dish here, especially using quinoa in a bokkeumbap (which is like a Korean fried rice). It definitely tasted the most healthy out of our array of dishes and was very unique. \\n- Wild Boar Dan Dan Noodles: Dan Dan noodles were good, but it was hard to share with a group of 6 because the portion isn't too big.

I am very disappointed in the service my siblings and I received. There was 5 of us and the restaurant looked steady. Food took awhile but that was expected because we ordered a lot of food. My sister received her soon tofu combination, but didn't get the usual egg with her soon tofu. We continued to wait and my other sister and I received our entrees. My eldest sister finally got her kimchi spicy pork dish, by then we were already halfway done with our entrees, she realized she didn't have a lot of pork in her dish. My brother was still waiting for his stone pot bibimbap. Our pancake (appetizer) finally came, but the waitress did not bring plates or serving utensil for us to split the pancake. We then realized that the table across from us (who was seated after us) was served the stone pot bibimbap. We can see that the staff began to discuss the entrees served at that table - possibly a mistake. That customer had already ate the stone pot bibimbap. My brother continued to wait. A waitress came by and reviewed our orders and \\"assured\\" us that the stone pot was comings. No apologies. A few minutes later another table (customers who was seated much later) was served a stone pot bibimbap. What we began to realize was both tables that were served the stone pot bibimbap before my brother, were white customers. I felt very disappointed from that point on. I was not comfortable. I was furious. To receive less than decent service all because my siblings and I are Asian. My brother finally got his bibimbap with a quick apology. The shop was about ready to close since the cooks were leaving and the waiting staff were having their dinner. We were waiting for our bill and boxes to take our food home. A waitress quickly walked by and mentioned boxes and grabbed ONE container. Dropped it off and went back to eat, not giving us a chance to even ask for more containers. We continued to wait. She returned to take our payment and quickly left again barely giving my sister a chance to request for more containers. Another waitress brought more containers and went back to dinner. The staff were having their dinner right next to us. We got up to leave and nothing was said by the staff. By the time I got out the door I finally heard the staffs say their farewells. But, they weren't bidding farewell to us. They were saying their goodbyes to the white customers that were leaving right behind us. I've experienced such racist service from other Asian restaurants before, but I never thought I would experience it here. I am very disappointed in the service that my family and I received. We weren't complicated customers. Yes, we took awhile to decide what to order  and came in the last hour. But, we didn't deserve that kind of service. We didn't have an attitude. Even with the staffs lack of attentiveness, we continuously waited patiently.

Gnocchi were quite hard (too much flour, maybe the wrong kind of potatoes? Perhaps they are peeled before boiling?) \\n\\nEssentially the food is okay. Nothing too spectacular, but not bad at all.\\n\\nWhat lowers the rating to 1 star is the service.\\n\\nThe restaurant is very small (some might say \\"cozy\\" I would say almost claustrophobic) and packed with tables, as many as you could squeeze in the little room. \\nThe staff should be enough to cater for the needs of every client (I believe there were 3 waitresses, maybe 4, for 30 people) yet we had to request silverware multiple times throughout the dinner, as some of us had received the food but had no fork to eat it with.\\n \\nBecause of the disposition of the tables, the staff needed to squeeze in between chairs to get to the clients, causing interruptions during other people's meal, not pleasant. \\nAlso, since everyone is basically sitting on a stranger's lap, physical interactions are inevitable. However, when the gentleman sitting behind my friend elbowed him for the 20th time, it seemed necessary to ask to please (key word being \\"please\\") be more careful. To this request, the waitress (a blonde wearing glasses) stepped in and said that she would not be serving us anymore because we had been rude to her father (presumably the elbowing guy) \\nNow, \\"the rude party\\" didn't make a scene, didn't call the manager, didn't even not tip her (on the assumption that the girls all share tips, we didn't want to penalize her colleagues) however, had I understood at the time what was happening (I was sitting right across the table, but the room was so packed and loud, I couldn't hear it) I would have definitely called the manager.

I know it was renovated recently.  They did keep the hand carved bar (oldest in America), which is absolutely beautiful.  We sat in the lounge.  There are 3 TV's in the bar, including one big screen.  They only have a few beers on draught.  It was noisy in the lounge, but very warm.  I am often cold in restaurants.  The bathrooms were freezing though.  The restaurant area was quieter.  This is not a dressy place at all, and the waitress was so friendly.  She couldn't have bee nicer.

The prices are great, especially during \\"happy hours.\\"  I love Japanese food, and have been delighted to find the \\"green phoenix\\" and shrimp tempura on the low-priced happy hour menu. The green phoenix sashimi is a combination of perfectly ripe avocado on top of tuna--really yummy. The tempura is authentic and perfectly cooked, but should come with rice. We almost always start with the shrimp shumai, which is flavorful, and comes steaming hot. My sister loves the yellowtail roll. I have had the cold sesame chicken noodles, which has a peanut sauce--it is filling and delicious. I recently tried the pork buns and wondered why I hadn't tried them before--the BEST I've ever had--the buns were freshly steaming hot and the pork w sauce delicious--surpassed anything I've had in NYC Chinese restaurants! I've noticed there are almost always more Asians than Caucasians (that's me) which makes me believe that the foods I haven't tried must be authentic and very good--I'm looking forward to experimenting with some of the the noodle dishes. I personally think the sushi I've had is as good as I've had elsewhere, except I recently had a sushi roll--I can't remember whether it was tuna or salmon--which just didn't have much flavor, and was disappointing. The service is always good and this has become a favorite place to eat out--so good and so close. Service is always good to great. The wait for our orders is never a problem. The decor is fun--especially the avant guard floors--very cool!  However, as happens with good food,  it has been \\"discovered,\\" so sometimes we have to wait, although not too long, and also noise levels are getting to be more of an issue--usually fine, but sometimes bordering on noisy.  Xian will only get busier--apparently they don't take reservations, but I think soon, they may want to consider it--at least for the busiest times."},{"name":"The Crepevine","address":"249 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"We stopped in a breakfast restaurant very close to this lovely little restaurant and inquired about gluten free options at the host stand.

Speido's opening in the Seaport district in Boston, I was excited.  I'm very aware of the talent and skill and of Marc Frasier and Clark Gaier, the chefs responsible for this Boston restaurant because I've been to their celebrated Arrows restaurant in Ogunquit Maine.  After having several amazing meals at this beautifully bucolic restaurant supported by their own organic farm, we chose to have my daughter's wedding there.  Every aspect of the wedding was superb and their attention to detail was a lesson in presentation and service.  Arrows is currently closed and I'm not sure if a sale is in the works.  The chefs have now moved forward with the MC brand and own M.C.Perkins Cove and now M.C. Speido's.  So, their reputation proceeded them.  However, when MC Speido's opened in the Rennaisance hotel, I was puzzled.  The food in hotel restaurants tends to be a compromise and by nature of the location, the ambiance can feel like a convention center.  But, we trusted the talent of these two leaders of the local food revolution\\n\\nMy husband and I had dinner at Speido's this summer and liked it somewhat.  The food was good..not great and the ambiance was theatrical, impersonal  and overdone.  The elegance and tastefulness of Arrows was hard to find..but hey..Marc and Clark wanted a change, so we said to ourselves.  Unfortunately, we went back for another visit a few weeks ago and what a disaster.  First of all, this is a BIG restaurant physically with a large seating capacity and it was almost empty.  The holiday season brings a bustling, brisk business to the Boston restaurant scene so we were concerned from the get go.  It also just felt weird...cold and vacuous.  In the summer, the server was a real professional but this visit felt like we were at Wendy's.  The poor fellow told us he was trying to learn the wine list but was not yet through the first page.  Too much information young man!!  And instead of asking for direction from a more experienced waiter, he sort of let us fumble (we don't know Italian wine well) and then took another 15 minutes bringing us our wine. What he was doing during the period of time, I can't say.  The menu is intended to satisfy the various meal needs of hotel guests but there are several nice entrees and salads.  Speido's features the Leonardo salad...the dressing of which supposedly came from Leonardo DaVinci's notebook...which was good....hard to mess up a Master!  My entree however was glum and it contained artichokes which hadn't been cleaned properly.  If anyone has prepared an artichoke....the name contains the world choke for a reason!  Without scrupulously cleaning the hairy indigestible center, one could truly choke.  No one had cleaned the center and if I wasn't aware, the staff might have been calling 911!!  At this point in our experience, it felt like mentioning this would fall on deaf ears so we just picked through our food. Someone behaving marginally  like a manager inquired about our meals and I mentioned my hairy artichoke.  He never apologized, took it off my plate to show the chef and that was that.  No complimentary cappuccinos, no taking that entree off the bill, none of the gestures that would have revealed a glimmer of the service and professionalism of Arrows.  In conversation with our waiter, he spoke enthusiastically about learning about Marc and Clark and Arrrows.  When asked if they showed up much, he said that he hadn't met them yet because now, they spent a lot of time vacationing.   There you have it.... Marc and Clark, MIA.

They are popular on a Saturday night, and rightly so.  The ambiance is just the right blend of exotic, trendy and casual.  There were several families with children, older people and family groups, and hipper young types.  The service is welcoming and prompt.  Everything we sampled - wild mushroom arepas, empanada with a manchego cheese salad, crisp-fried red snapper with tostones, and fried sweet plantains - was just excellent.   The black beans in our son's white rice & black bean dish were smoky and delicious, literally the best I've ever had  - and I've traveled extensively and lived in Latin America.   The only reason I'm not giving Orinoco 5 stars is because the meat in another dish, the arepa with \\"mechada\\" or shredded beef, was overly sweet.  Also, although my sangria went down easy, it wasn't like a real sangria because it had no fruit and tasted more of rum than of red wine, and it gave me an instant headache.

Otherwise, I'm in jeans and a t-shirt and my chucks and that said, i don't really do a lot of \\"upscale\\" places but, I LOVE good food.  So we go in and as soon as we get there i feel weird being there in my attire.  We sit at the bar and the bartender, Bruce, didn't bat an eyelash.  He took our beverage orders and brought us a bar menu and pointed out the ones that were half off.  They had a live jazz band playing that was very good and tasteful.  I really enjoyed the decor of the place being that it felt like it was an older building or that the restaurant had been there for a number of years.  The crowd there was very eclectic as well.  I ordered the Corn and Crab Chowder and it was heavy on the corn, which is fine by me and had four bay leaves in it as well.  I wasn't sure if it was bay leaves or crab claw meat when i got it b/c it's kind of dark.  I quickly realized it was a bay leaf and remember eating at a tex-mex place back home and my friend bit into his burrito and started choking on a bay leaf and him saying \\"they're trying to kill me!  f*@king bay leaf!\\".  Next up, we had the crab cake.  Boy, do I love crab cakes.  I am going to mention that i ordered three things.  I'm a bit of a glutton and i enjoy trying things at new places, think of it as a tasting menu but, i usually eat ALL of it :( .  That said, the crab cake was HUGE!  It was around 4-5 inches in diameter and around 1 1/2\\" tall.  I was in shock.  It was served with a chive remoulade sauce.  I liked that it was just a touch of the sauce and not just slathered in it.  The sauce really brought out the flavors but, didn't overpower anything.  Lastly, i had the tempura scallops with sugar snap peas, mushrooms and a spicy black bean sauce.  It came with about 6 jumbo scallops, not quite U-10's but, close.  They were delicious.  There was a guy sitting next to me from Chicago that was obviously in town on business but, a regular and he was suggesting EVERYTHING i was already thinking of getting.

I have no problem paying a few bucks more for something high quality and made with pride and passion. You won't find your typical north shore sub shop menu with 110 items at GiGi's. What you will find is a compact menu consisting of high quality fresh food. You can order one of the menu sandwiches or build your own. Personal favorites from the menu are the Vinci, Bobby Rossetti and the now gone Smitty. :(   I've been building my own sandwich lately using the chicken cutlet, which by the way is amazing, add some bacon, lettuce, onion, melted cheddar, and mayo and clamp it together on a Scali and you got serious case of The Itis after you're done. If you're into salads then I would suggest the Fresca, its a next level taste experience as far as salads go. I need to eat more salads instead of sandwiches, but I have a weakness for that chicken cutlet and Scali. The staff and owner are friendly and always happy to see the regulars. Its a tough market full of bad food in the north shore area. People will pay $10 for a low quality sub on soggy bread from one of the sketchy roast beef pizza seafood places but don't understand that $2 more gets them a way higher quality food experience at GiGi's.

There are a bunch to choose from, and I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their beef burgers.  None of us tried their non-beef options, so I can't comment on those.\\n\\nThe fries are nicely seasoned but were a little bit limp -- wish they were crunchier.\\n\\nTheir milkshakes are all made from their homemade ice creams -- really cool.\\n* Peach Cobbler milkshake: 4 stars. Most people liked it, but I thought it was only OK.\\n* Vanilla Bean milkshake: 3 stars. SUPER sweet... not my favorite.\\n* Nutella & Pretzel milkshake: 5 stars. Loved it. Just the right amount of sweetness, plus a nice crunch from the pretzel bits. I was worried the pretzels would be annoyingly salty but that wasn't an issue at all.\\n\\nOverall: I recommend eating here, BUT try to avoid peak times & try to avoid Fridays/weekends if possible."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"These are hands down some of the best donuts that I have ever eaten. They are soft and dense with a nice base flavor. Add on the wide array of changing unique flavors and they are a true dream. The lemon poppy seed is hands down the best donuts I have ever eaten. They also have one that has peanut butter powder on the outside and jam filling, the powder on the outside is what makes the donuts so tasty. But my absolute favorite is the lemon poppy seed, the lemon is bright and beautiful without being overwhelming.

I only wish the noodles were a bit thinner and softer, and that the broth was a little richer. I realized later on that I should have ordered the miso broth instead of the shoyu broth, but that was my mistake! I'm a big fan of having things on the table that I can add in my soup, like garlic and seaweed, but unfortunately they have none. It was very good ramen, they are fast, and the staff is really great, but it just didn't quite make it to 5 stars for me. \\n\\nUPDATE:\\nSo now that we realized we should have been ordering miso broth all along, my fianc√© and I decided to give this place another try. Two things happened: 1. I'm a vegetarian, however I do make an exception for broth, and I think vegetarian ramen is disgusting so I don't order it, I just order regular ramen with meat on the side which I give to my fianc√©. (Don't judge) This usually works fine, however this broth is just swimming in meat bits. I spent have of my time (both trips) picking out meat pieces. Again, I did not like the thickness or firmness of the noodles. They gave me hardly any broth, literally half a bowl, and it tasted almost like it came from a powdery mix. It lacked depth in a big way. I thought, yeah, I won't be coming back here again, and I'm lowering my score to 3 stars. Meanwhile...2. My fianc√© across the table says, \\"This is probably the best ramen I've ever had! I love the noodles, the spiciness, the broth, and the meat chunks!\\" \\n\\nSo really, it comes down to your personal preference. I did not like it, but my fianc√© loved it. I'll stick with 4 stars, but he is pretty insistent we come back again  and I try the vegetarian one. We shall see. \\n\\nANOTHER UPDATE:\\nI came back with friends and they so graciously strained my soup and cooked my noodles more. Now that I could concentrate on the flavor instead of inspecting each bite for meat chunks, I VERY much enjoyed my ramen. I tried the corn butter miso this time and it was so tasty...my mouth is watering just thinking about it now..."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Delicious.

My prayers have been answered.  So happy when I read about it on Yelp and got over here as soon as I could.\\n\\nSo SKD is a lot like the Korean tofu houses down in LA.  Similar formula of a menu of different types of tofu soup, you choose how spicy, and it comes with rice in a stone pot.  I have to say they did a really good job with the menu which was easy to read and not so overwhelming like the typical Korean restaurant menu.  I like that they mainly focus on certain Korean dishes (tofu soup and bbq) and don't try to do it all.\\n\\nWe got a medium spicy, kimchee tofu soup which was pretty darn spicy!  The little bits of seafood were nicely cooked.  We had a combo with the spicy pork, which is a rockin good deal for a nice amount of meat.  I'd have to say the pork was actually a little harsh and too spicy.  It's supposed to be spicy, but typically there's a little bit of sweetness too, which was missing...  My husband and I actually shared the soup/pork combo as well as an order of japchae and extra order of rice.  This was actually a good amount of food for us (along with the panchan that comes with the meal).  Although if you really want to feast, I recommend you get your own soup!\\n\\nThe japchae which was super tasty, a bit different than I'm used to.

I loved the variety of both noodle dishes and soups and salads.\\nDislikes:  I wasn't excited about the sushi, I have very high standards for my sushi and you can tell they were stingy with sashimi/ raw fish rolls. They didn't have inari, eel, tuna or salmon (raw), or fresh seaweed rolls.

We had an absolute blast together and interacting with the bartender (who ended up being from Georgia Southern as well). \\n\\n1. Atmosphere: We went to Pour on a Tuesday, so it wasn't too busy. We love to sit at bars, so we took a seat right in the middle of the bar area. It is a cute little place with exposed brick and a big wrap-around bar. It has a very intimate feel and was relatively quiet, but it was a Tuesday. Some wine bars feel very pretentious, but this place felt sophisticated without the ostentatious \\"wine-o\\" effect. The bartender mentioned that it gets pretty packed on the weekends and that there's live music now, so I want to go back and check it out on a Friday or Saturday. \\n\\n2. Service: Since we sat at the bar, we got to interact directly with the bartender. He was so informative about the wine without being too pushy toward the more expensive bottles. He was funny, personable, and took the time to describe each cheese to us when we were trying to decide on a cheese plate. He was great about keeping our glasses full and had some great stories to share with us. By the end of the night, I felt like we were old friends - he even called us by name as he told us good night!\\n\\n3. Drinks: We knew we wanted a Cabernet, but couldn't decide on one, so the bartender had us do a blind tasting to figure out which one we liked best, which was fun. We ended up with the Bridlewood and it was a perfect selection. I liked it more and more with every sip - it was smooth and had a great flavor. We're not exactly wine connoisseurs , but we loved it. \\n\\n4. Food: We didn't have dinner here, but we did get the cheese plate. We got the four cheese sampler for $14 and it came with a bowl of crostinis and was served over a bed of shaved almonds, blueberries and figs. There were 8 cheeses to choose from, but we ended up with the Gruyere, Heat (an infused cheddar with peppers), Red Dragon (a cheddar with mustard seed), and Brie. We liked the Heat and the Red Dragon the most. The Heat packs a punch, so if you're weak when it comes to spicy food, you might want to do something else. The Red Dragon is also very mustard-y, so if you're not a mustard fan, run the other way (But I'm pretty much obsessed). I think the Gruyere cheese went best with the wine that we were drinking. \\n\\nOverall, it was the perfect amount for us and it was fun trying all the distinct flavors. \\nPour Bistro is the perfect date-night locale. Granted, we didn't eat dinner here, but the wine, cheese, and bartender are certainly worth the trip. We kept teasing the next day that we just want to drink wine and eat different cheeses every night! ;)  I can't wait to go back for dinner and to listen to the band on the weekends."},{"name":"Common Ground Coffee Roasters","address":"1727 Revere Beach Pkwy","city":"Everett","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I finally got in here on my lunch break the other day.

My only complaint was not having any instructions on how to eat such a small (argubly 3in in diameter at most), but tall burger (mine seemed to be about 5in high) without making a mess. The fries were good, but trying the fried pickles made me wish I had that instead. Using the mayo mix on my fries was fun for the first few minutes but was old soon after. I'm not a huge fan of Krispy Kreme so the shake didn't impress me. It does taste like the doughnut (probably because they add some in there) so Krispy Kreme fans will enjoy it. The shortcake shake was good, but was old after spending a lot of time trying to suck bits of cake into up my straw.\\n\\nIt's hard to write a review about the dishes here because opinions will vary based on topping preference.

With that caveat in mind, here's what I thought about Southland:\\n\\nWe started with the fried green tomatoes appetizer. The tomatoes were a lot more red than green and missed that zing that you find in a good fried green tomato.\\n\\nFor the main meal, my wife and I had the catfish and the brisket, respectively, and shared between us. The catfish had a great flavor and texture, but the greens that accompany it could've been cooked a bit longer. Southern greens need not be crispy. Great flavor on them though. Also, the red beans and rice were excellent.\\n\\nThe brisket came by default covered in their house sauce, which is really good if not a tad bit tomato-y. Personally, I liked making a mix of their sweet and spicy sauces (available at your table), so my suggestion would be to order it dry and go your own way on the sauces. For my sides, I got the baked beans and the grit sticks. While the baked beans were standard fare, the grit sticks blew my freaking mind! They're grits... in cheesy \\"log\\" form. Think cheese grits disguised as cornbread. They were definitely the highlight of the meal, and I'll probably be getting them as one of my sides from here on out.\\n\\nSo, the meal was solid. Some things weren't like \\"back home\\" (oh, boo hoo!) but all in all, I have no real complaints. Probably the 3rd best Southern-style meal I've had in PDX, behind Po'Shines and Screen Door. That said, if you don't want to wait an hour+ for good food, Southland is your boy. I'm definitely looking forward to taking down their ribs and fried chicken at some point. And apparently, there's whiskey here as well! :)"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"One of my favourite brunch places!

This was coincidentally the same location of Tom Catherall's sushi restaurant Goldfish. There's plenty of mall parking out front - unfortunately there's also a huge area roped off for the valet so you will probably need to walk a bit unless you can stand waiting for your car when you're ready to leave (pet peeve of mine).\\n\\nI have a bit of a love-hate relationship with The Cowfish - it's near my work so it's convenient and I think in general the food is good here. To understand this place, think of two contrasting food types, in this case hamburgers and sushi, and mash them together into interesting combinations. I have eaten here a few times and did not have a high opinion - the food flavors work but in general, I thought it a bit pricey for what you received (more on that later) and really, why eat here when there are so many good burger and sushi joints nearby? My opinion improved during a Yelp Elite event when I was able to taste much of the menu and met one of the owners (from Austin Texas). This owner-chef really gets things and I could tell he had a genuine love of food and was all-in regarding the success of Cowfish.\\n\\nThe interior of The Cowfish is Industrial-Modern with concrete floors and plenty of tile and wood finishes. The place gets packed during lunch and dinner, but a bit less so during the time in-between so I would recommend either a late lunch or early dinner - or if you're by yourself sit at the bar and avoid any waits. I love the homage artwork on pretty much all the walls - these are common graphic designs with an intentional Cowfish element working into the graphics - it takes a lot of time and talent to do this and these artists do it well. There's well designed elements everywhere you look - even the bathroom signs on the doors add an element whimsy you rarely see - I like a restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously. There are also as you would expect fish tanks so you can stare at what would otherwise be food (make sure you visit an actual Cowfish behind the bar).\\n\\nThe initial meal I had here got me into a negative path - the restaurant was newly open and my expectations were fairly low. We started with the Crab Rangood Dip and it was unusual and good. I ordered a Burgushi Bento box and my friends ordered burgers with fries. I figured the Bento would give me an overall taste of what the restaurant was about as it included a slider and a few pieces of sushi. The problem with both dishes has to do with the amount of fries and fodder included to keep the pricing low. I love fries and edamame as much as the next guy but if that's all I remember from what I've eaten it puts me in the wrong mindset. In a word, the bento was just not worth what I paid for the little bit of real food compartmentalized in the box - and frankly the slider was tiny, maybe 1.5 inches square (small enough that I could have eaten it in one bite - instead I tried to stretch it to two). Ugh.\\n\\nSince that initial visit I've had pretty much everything on the menu. For appetizers I'd go with the Blackened Tuna Nachos or the Spicy Poke Dip. I also like in general the salads and the burgers, provided you sub a salad for the fries (unless you really, really like fries as there's a lot of them) or get their very good cucumber salad. If you opt for the a side-salad then get the Parmesan Bacon Truffle Fries as an app. I think the sushi here is good and the rolls tasty - but I prefer nigiri over rolls and fortunately the fish here is fresh (not that frozen crap you get at buffets).\\n\\nThe service here can be a bit hit-or-miss but has improved to the point where I've revised my opinion, rounding up and give The Cowfish 4 of 5 stars. This is an improvement over my initial opinion of 2.5 rounding to 3 stars.\\n\\n(Also posted to my food blog)"},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome fried chicken.

These guys do the thing with the lettuce, where they include lettuce, which I'm not totally on board with - I like it just onions and tomatoes, that's how I was raised. But it's nice with the rice cause you got a little bit of like a side salad happening, esp if you get some extra white sauce. Get extra red too because they don't put much on there and the interplay between the cool white sauce and the spicy red sauce, along with the yellow rice, is what puts this over the top. And the gyro meat is fantastic, a little greasy and very tender - this isn't like Verts where they give you like shaved boot in what appears to be a whole wheat waffle. This is like the real thing. My wife got the chicken kabob over rice and she went nuts, she loved it.

My party ordered two pies with a carafe of wine. I expected the carafe to be standard size filled about halfway up, the way most people do it. The one they gave us was the size of a lemonade pitcher and filled to the brim. The legendary Boston pizza that I've heard so much about is, in fact, good. I walked out of that restaurant fat, buzzed, and happy.\\n\\nBut it's not as good as it's reputation says.\\n\\nThe word I'd use to sum up all their problems is \\"inconsistency\\". Not every pizza is made the same. After we were served, I looked around the room at everyone's pies and realized that each one was a different level of cooked. That's just poor quality control. I'm not gonna lie, this was a little bit disheartening for me especially because I heard that Santarpio's cooks to their pizza well-done & with a hint of char, like the way they do it in New Haven Connecticut. That's how I like it and that's how the pizza made for the frat boys next to us turned out... but not ours. Our cheese pizza was served more as a Regina's style (*gasp*) with that soft little \\"loin\\" in the center where the pizza gets a bit soggy.  I mean, it was a fine cheese pizza if you like it that way. But that's not me man.\\n\\nAnd... I almost feel awkward bringing this up... but there was a Muslim couple sitting next to us. They were having quite a lovely date getting lamb tips and a pie... until the restaurant accidentally served them a pizza with pork on it. If you didn't know, that's FORBIDDEN in their culture. It's like a Hindu person being served beef or a Pats fan being given a Giants Jersey. It's just sacrilegious. What's worse, the waiter didn't admit he was at fault right away and tried to play it off like that's how the dude ordered it. I mean, I know part of this joint's reputation is the \\"get in, have this delicious pie, and get the **** out\\" east Boston townie style but.. c'mon man. (Luckily, I'm pleased to say the waiter eventually apologized and this turned out all right)\\n\\nAight, now that I've spend two paragraphs being a pizza snob let me finish this off by saying the Pizza was, in fact, delicious. The whole \\"toppings under the cheese\\" things works. In fact, I think the pepperonis on my 2nd pie were some of the best I've ever had (both in terms of how they were cooked and the quality of the ingredients). The cheese... ow wow the cheese... That was some goooooood cheese. And the hot peppers complimented the pepperonis perfectly. The crust was good and crunchy too, even with the inconsistent pie to pie baking levels. But it also had that chewyness you expect with a good pie. I LOVE the corn flower they use to coat the bottom of the pie. It adds a certain nuttiness to the whole thing. And I could tell the tomatoes were fresh. The whole thing just pops when you put in in you mouth.\\n\\nSo yeah, solid pie. Not the gold standard of it's reputation but I had a great time and enjoyed my meal. Our waiter was very impressed that we ate two whole pies. Might come back again and get one with the works. Hopefully it's cooked to the same level as the one that the frat boys next to us got."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My love of the zuni roll brought me to buy a panini grill just so we could make them at home.

Maybe even two.  I don't know, I don't know if I'll have enough time.\\n\\n  So I got the Fish Taco platter based on other people recommendations and the fact that I'm a huge fish taco fan (yes, I know that's a double entendre.)   I got one hard and one soft (again, I know that's another entendre, get your mind out of the gutter.)   The platter was $7 total, not bad but not a steal either.\\n\\n The hard taco shells didn't seem to be homemade as I saw all the shells and they were uniform in size and shape, but who knows?  If anyone can confirm or deny props to them.  The hard taco was pretty good,   The Fish was good as well, lightly battered, no heavy fish and chip type batter which is terrible on Fish tacos.  The fish was very moist on the inside (last double entendre for you and me.)  Not  huge serving of fish, but nothing to complain about.  They topped it with lettuce and salsa.  Now here's where I have a little problem, every fish taco connoisseur knows you gots to have the red cabbage for fish tacos.  But at least it came with a very tasty chipotle sauce (seemed like a mayo based sauce).  Then came the soft taco and here's where they dropped the ball a little bit.  I like soft tacos more, and it seemed like it was going to be very good.  They put 2 soft taco tortillas on the flat grill and and doubled them up for one taco.  But when I ate them, they were very chewy and seemed not so cooked.  Trust me when I say I know my soft tacos, if I liked the hard taco more than the soft, that's not a good thing.  Maybe this is a one time thing, but based on what I ate today that dropped them down a peg.\\n\\nIf I could I would give them a 3.5 based on today, but with the soft tacos and the no cabbage, I'll round down to 3.  Also I will say I am going to be a little of a tougher grader, a three for me is a place I would go to again, but wouldn't go out of my way to go to.\\n\\nAlso, not included in this review, I got a Chicken Mole burrito from their stand once.  It was good, but the mole sauce wasn't too flavorful and they could have steamed the tortilla more.

However, this time around, we heard about Blue Star being the \\"new Voodoo\\" and were super excited to try it after hearing people rave about it. \\n\\nWe stood in line for 45 minutes in the cold rain and finally as we entered the store, we realized how unorganized everything was. On a Sunday morning of a holiday weekend, they only had 1 register open. The lines were just ridiculous with no clear direction of what was happening. Anyway, we ordered our box of donuts and just decided to try 4- Old Fashioned Buttermilk, Basil Bourbon Blueberry, Maple Bacon, and Apple Fritter. To be fair, I didn't try them right away as we had just eaten a huge breakfast but instead had them the next morning. I was sooo disappointed. :( I couldn't even eat the Maple Bacon...it had a really weird flavor to it. I think it would've been better if the bacon were cooked prior to being put on the donut. My favorite was the old fashioned....though the icing was extremely sweet. The consistency of the donuts were really dense and I felt like they used too much lemon zest in their glaze. Inside the store, you're able to watch the employees package up the donuts for you. There was no sense of urgency to their motions even though the line was out the door. I almost wanted to go help the lady individually wrap each donut in paper before putting them into the box. It was just a really strange experience that didn't make a lot of sense from an operation standpoint.\\n\\nOverall, I did not feel like it was worth the 45 minutes wait. We ended up going to Voodoo the next day and only stood in an organized line for 20 minutes. Their Maple Bacon donut is to die for!

The bread was too soft for my liking and lacked that element of chewiness. But serving bao with dipping sauce? What a faux pas! Bao should be able to stand up on their own without a dipping sauce masking the flavor. In my personal opinion, there shouldn't be so many dipping sauce options.

When I looked it up it, was a bit out of the way but holy kitten titties I'm glad we did go.\\n\\nI don't know why exactly but we got VIP treatment. I chatted with the front-of-house manager about my culinary prowess with southern and cajun cooking (I've studied and cooked both for 15+ years) and when we sat down our server informed us we weren't allowed to order and that the kitchen was going to give us a tour of the menu. When does that ever happen?\\n\\nThey started with a small plate of fried green tomatoes which I know from experience are hard to get right. These were spot on. The tomatoes held firm and were meaty. The cornbread breading was lightly salted and really lifted the experience. The remoulade was made in house and was phenomenal. It was creamy and poignant but not overwhelming and the whole dish was very well balanced.\\n\\nNext was a kind of southern charcuterie plate with a couple ribs, a pile of pulled pork, and a stack of sliced brisket. Now I'm a sucker for brisket but the ribs were out of this world. You wouldn't expect a place like SWK to compete with Roper's in St. Louis or a rack of \\"extra bark\\" from Central in Memphis but they did. They held to the bone just enough for me to manage slathering them with the house and spicy sauce and they were smoked just enough to taste the meat still. The brisket was unique in the way it was presented. It was what brisket should be, not pulled, and it was less smoked then most others I've had. It was a great vehicle for the gold sauce (a mustard, tamarind, jalapeno blend not soon forgotten) but my favorite and a complete surprise with the brisket was the white sauce: tangy, sweet, and savory. While it didn't pair particularly well with anything on the plate, I couldn't help slathering it on everything and even mopping it up with the cornbread.\\n\\nOur next plate was the fried chicken... served as hot as possible as only the best southern fried chicken should. It wasn't heavily breaded which was nice and made for a lighter plate. The chicken has been brined and really shined through. I lot of places put the salt in the breading and hide the chicken under it but not at SWK. Those were some of the cleanest bones I've ever returned to a plate. The garlic mashers and gravy were as expected, I'd have like them to have a bit of cream worked in and maybe whipped them a bit more but they came off as \\"homestyle\\" and I'm ok with that. The chicken came with a side of beans and collards. The collards were some of the best I've had outside of the south and could've been a meal in themselves. They had to have been locally sourced.\\n\\nNext up was the heavy-weight champion of the night, shrimp and grits. I've had some good downhome grits in my life but these were so much more than grits. The shrimp was grilled with a sweet lime dressing and the grits themselves were creamy and light with a flavor so intoxicating I needed to take a moment between bites to reassess my life.\\n\\nAfter the grits we were given a moment to call our parents and tell them we loved them before we were presented with an amuse-bouche style dessert plate with bites of key-lime pie, apple crumble, and sweet potato pie. The key lime was a bit pudding-ish and was pretty standard otherwise but not bad. The apple crumble was nicely caramelized and had a lot of depth of flavor. The sweet potato pie was so light and sweet I could've taken home a whole pie if I wasn't already struggling to exist. Another bite might have killed me. \\n\\nAnd now I find myself 1,000 miles away dying to go back.

If you want good Indian in the JP area go to the Himalayan in West Roxbury.\\n \\nMy husband and I went on a Friday night and had a 7:30 reservation. Walking in the door we ran into a crowd of about 8 people all standing by the hostess station. We all stood there for 15-20 minutes without anyone greeting us or taking our name. Finally when a waitress came by we grabbed her and told her we had a reservation. She looked in her book and walked away. 10 minutes later she came back. During this whole time she never acknowledged the other customers waiting to be seated or even asked for their names. \\n\\nWe were finally seated at a tiny table at the back of the restaurant. I had an ice cold breeze on my back emanating from the crack of the bench I was seated on. This was solved by shoving my coat in the crack.\\n\\nOur table was tiny and sticky but we were happy to be seated. No one came to offer us a drink for a good 10 minutes. Once our waiter arrived we quickly ordered drinks and food. The food came out fast. The apps were ok but had that distinct microwave taste (chewy on the outside and burning hot in the middle). The main courses were horrible. Really the worst renditions of staple Indian dishes that I have ever had. We had Mali Kofta, Lamb Vindaloo and a chana dish. All 3 tasted like canned tomato sauce. There was no spice in any of them and the potatoes and chickpeas in the dish had no flavoring. You could tell that they had been tossed into the sauce right before they were brought out. All of the sauces tasted exactly the same. Also the wine I had was horrible. It tasted as if it had been open for days. The women at the table next to us refused to drink her wine it was so bad.\\n\\nThe service was no better then the food. I am not even sure who our waiter was since we never saw him. They did not clear plates before bringing more food. The food runner even placed the naan dish in my hands since there was no room on the table. It was burning hot and I almost dropped it. He walked away as my husband and I tried to find room on the table for it. The end was no better then the beginning.

I will start with the pros. \\n  The place is spotless, open and welcoming. \\n   The gentleman behind the scenes was very friendly and helpful when he came out.\\n  The meatballs are good. (I know this because there was so much basil on my son's sandwich he wouldn't eat more than one bite so I tried it). \\nSalad was fresh and dressing was very good. \\nCons:\\n 40 minute wait for 3 sandwiches and a salad. This was at 7pm mid week. A family of four ordered behind me and were finished eating before I got my take out. I asked if there was a particular reason for that and was told to order ahead like they had. I pointed out that I was standing there when they ordered and they did not call ahead. The woman replied \\"Oh, just call it in next time.\\" I understand that there are mix ups on occasion, but own up to it.  Don't lie. If the food was outstanding, I don't think I would return just because of the dishonesty, but that's not going to be an issue. One son got chicken cutlet. NO PEPPERS. Said this 3 times, just to be sure. The sandwich had so many roasted peppers on it, the chicken, as well as the bread tasted like nothing but peppers.  No one in the family likes roasted peppers. Also got a pastrami sandwich which would have been ok but it has some kind of bitter pickle on it.  $59.00 for 3 sandwiches a salad and four drinks. Would gladly pay that somewhere else with accountable customer service and the food that we ordered. So disappointed . Was hoping this was going to be a place for a good Italian sandwich. Why is it that a little it's like Everett has 3 or 4, but there isn't one on the north shore?  I'll drive to Bucci's.

The bartender there was a complete snob and everybody seemed out of sorts, as though they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\nThe food was nowhere near as good as we remembered from last time. The chicken samosas were bland-ish; the tikka masala was completely standard; the chana saag was fine, but not outstanding. The only dish that we found to be somewhat memorable was the seafood in garlic and red wine, which suffered from not having that many pieces of actual seafood (i.e. two shrimp). Overall, pretty good, but would be run-of-the-mill in a bigger city.\\n\\nService sucked all around: it was hasty and inattentive.

Monday nights all wine bottles are 25% off so that was a nice surprise. We had the Ramspeck Pinot which I recommend - lighter and spicier than most pinot. But I'm not really a wine expert so I'll leave it at that. \\n\\nFor the foods, we tried the mista salad and an arugula salad from the specials menu. Holy crackers. That arugula salad was fuckin' dope. Baby arugula leaves, an orange-olive oil vinaigrette; toasted pine nuts; red onions; and three peppadew peppers stuffed with goat cheese. My man don't even like peppers or goat cheese that much and he ate a whole one and then was eyeing the other two! Damn, man! Keep your eyes on your own salad! The mista salad was good, too, with a light coating of balsamic vinaigrette. \\n\\nAfter that, we shared three small plates: meatballs, polenta fries, fritta mista. The meatballs were awesome. You get 5 stacked up in a pond of fresh tomato sauce with some cheese on top. Great texture - firm but tender. Polenta fries were also really good: crunchy outside and creamy inside. Plus they were served in a super cute paper bag. The sodium level was a little bit of a creeper, though. Meaning, it creeps up on you until you realize, 'Whoa this is salty'.  Fritta mista was a combo of lightly battered (tempura style) calamari, artichoke hearts, shallot rings and lemon slices. Kinda loved the shallot rings the best; they were like tiny onion rings. \\n\\nEven though we were super super full after all that, we still had the dessert special of chocolate bread pudding. Honestly I have never had a bread pudding that I liked until this one. The texture was like a dense chocolate mousse, but with crispy edges all around. It was liberally sprinkled with walnuts and a caramel sauce with a  blob of whipped cream on top. Sheeeit. We ate that whole damn thing. \\n\\nAnd the decor. I can understand some people's complaints of it being weird or whatever, but it reminded me of a restaurant you'd see in a movie set in 1960s Italy, minus the go-go dancers that I also imagine would be there.

But don't let looks deceive you- the food coming out of this place is fricken awesome (and really affordable!), and I regret not living closer because I would order from here multiple times a week if I could. \\n\\nTo start, we split the Aloo Chat (awesome, a must-try), the pan-fried veggie momos (well-made and came with 2 very spicy sauces), and garlic naan (perfectly crispy yet pillowy, just how I like it). I had the Chicken Dhaniwal Korma, and it was excellent- like a really good Indian korma but with the addition of tomato flavor (and probably some other spices?). We also got the Goat Curry which happily had large chunks of goat (unlike other places where it's mostly bone), and the Jeera Aloo which was full of flavor. Note that when you order 'medium' spicy here, it's actually pretty spicy but in a good way. We were thrilled with everything we ate, and can't recommend this place enough.\\n\\nShoutout to the owner's brother Jay, who was a consummate host while we ate in and was so excited for us to enjoy their food.

But finally my husband and I went on a Monday night (no line), and I'm so glad we did!\\n\\nDRINKS:\\n\\nLet's start with drinks, because that is literally where you start at this place. GENIUS idea to have the bar right by where you wait in line! The wait definitely doesn't seem as bad as you lean against the bar sip on some delicious cocktails. The bartenders are very helpful, and they have an awesome chart on the beer taps to help you decide what kind of draft beer you would like (great selection according to my husband- a lot of IPAs). I got a giant goblet full of margarita and beer, and it was amazing. \\n\\nFOOD:\\n\\nMy husband got the Llano Poblano, and loved it, and I got the Continental Club (with no bacon), and it was honestly one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had. We also got a side of friend and green chile queso (why not?)- another great decision. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\n\\nThere isn't really service, although once you sit down you do have someone to get you anything you need (refills, condiments, BAR DRINKS) which is pretty convenient.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nYou don't get to pick where you sit-simply bc the line moves as tables get up. This is similar, I know, to a lot of restaurants on a wait- but you can normally request certain locations. Normally we are patio people- but the outside tables are a little too close to the street for me- so I wasn't bummed that we were inside. And inside isn't bad- not too noisy, and the vibe was good. So unless you are VERY picky about your table choice, this isn't really a con. Another con would be waiting in line- I said before that we didn't have to wait outside- and I honestly don't think I ever will. I will wait inside with a drink in my hand, but a 2 hour wait outside on a summer day? No thanks. So, when I go back, I will definitely go on a weeknight so I can beat the traffic.\\n\\nOverall, this place has great food, great drinks, decent prices, and a pretty unique atmosphere that obviously PLENTY of people love.

There was no ketchup, but when asked about condiments the waitress brought us a small glass full of  \\"pepper juice\\" -- a yellowish liquid that must have come out of the peppers while cooking. Interesting...\\nI heard that the place hasn't changed in the past 50 years, if you're into that kind of thing. I'm not the nostalgic type myself.\\nOur waitress was great but the place was packed and it took forever to get our order. And they didn't have any menus (?!). Nor ketchup (did I already rant about that?).\\nConsidering that it's not in my neighborhood, I'm not sure if I would take the pain to come back. But if you live next door, good for you!"},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Incredibly fresh, modern feel.

All in all good experience."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Super good! I'm new to Austin, and during my past few times out on South Congress I saw long lines out the door at Hopdoddy and wondered what it was about. It's just burgers, right? Why the line? So last Monday night I dropped by around 7 to give it a try, determined to wait in a long line if necessary. There was no line out the door this time, which was good, but I still had to wait about 15 minutes in line inside. - The way it works is you wait in line to order at the counter in the back of the restaurant, and while you wait, a line-person (not a server - this person just works the line) takes your name and number in your party. They'll get a server for you if you want to order a drink. (The beers are great, and come in HUGE, ice-cold glass goblets. -- The name of the restaurant comes from the combo of hop (beer) + doddy, which according their website is the nickname for the native cow in Aberdeen, Scotland....  k) When, a table comes up, the line-person tells you what number table you will be at, where it is located and who your server will be. You give your table number to the cashier when you order, and then your server brings your order to your table. So with the long lines, it can be a bit of a wait, but holding a nearly-frozen beer the size of your head makes the wait much more bearable. \\n\\nA big sign over the hallway to the ordering counter lets you know everything is natural, locally sourced and house-made when possible - you can buy their fresh buns if you want - and they list their suppliers and locations on a chalkboard next to the line. The menu board has12 burgers to choose from, with some pretty ecclectic options (the Magic Shroom has Angus beef, Texas goat cheese, field mushrooms, mayo and pesto; and the Janis Joplin has a hemp seed veggie patty, avocado, sprouts, Tillamook cheddar and horseraddish honey mustard), ranging in price from $5.50 to $12. I chose the Buffalo Bill (bison, blue cheese, Frank's hot sauce, apple-smoked bacon and Sassy Sauce) at $10, with an order of Kennebec fries (regular fries with a sprinkling of parsley -- or you can choose chili cheese fries) at $2.25 (chili cheese fries are $5.50). With my $6 beer, the total came to $18.25 before tax, tip and additional beer. Not cheap.\\n\\nEach table has it's own large napkin roll (think brown paper towels) and your assigned number hanging on a hook. The large roll is needed. My burger was excellent - really juicy, with just the right amount of blue cheese and hot sauce -- a combo you might not think would work welll but does. I'd never had bison before, and I really enjoyed it. The flavor was a lot milder than I had expected - not gamey - and very tender. -- The fries were only ok, which gets this burger joint 4 stars instead of 5. \\n\\nOverall, great food and a fun atmosphere. I will definitely be bringing family here soon, and my friends/family when they visit Austin."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I would really like to give this place a 3.5 or 4 Star review, but the service killed it...

The server was very \\"cold\\" and had somewhat of an attitude from the beginning: she was really \\"in a hurry\\" to take our order, didn't take time to explain the menu or anything at all, although we did mention it was our first time there... In a few minutes the place kind of filled up, and her attitude just continued to be bad or even worse...\\n\\nAfter some good recommendations from the people sitting next to us, we ordered our food and it came pretty fast. I had the German Sausage Sample Plate with 4 kinds of house made sausage including their famous Bahama Mama, sauerkraut, german potato salad, chunky apple sauce and toast. Food was delicious. My girlfriend had the German Meatloaf plate which was also delicious!\\n\\nThe Cream Puff had to be \\"To Go\\" since we were stuffed, but that was a Bad Ass 1/2 pound Cream Puff! \\n\\nAgain, the server then stated in a somewhat apologetic way at the end that they were \\"short staffed since it was a Monday night and it was cold out and they sent some staff home early since they didn't expect it to get busy that night\\"... Again, this is a popular, well-known place in German Village, with good reviews and plenty of good advertised food on numerous Food channels and websites.
