Sushi on one end, hibachi another, and a mix of different foods throughout. As more people arrived it became difficult to navigate to the different food stations. \\n\\nI also noticed that some of the fish had bones and there should have been a sign warning you of this. My friend almost choked when eating a stuffed shrimp. Why are there bones in stuffed shrimp (clueless)?\\n\\nI checked the reviews beforehand but I wasn't prepared for the bill. I thought for my experience it wasn't worth it. I don't like buffets and I had a small plate of food that was picked over.

I ordered the clam chowder which I figured for 10$ would be a dinner size. It was not. I stopped for food shortly after going out to dinner. Another issue was burned bacon in the chowder - not good. I previously looked at the menu before going to the restaurant as I am a very finicky eater. The menu in the restaurant comes out on a piece of folded paper......Also, it's different than what is online. I mentioned it to our server and he said he'd been getting a lot of that vibe from people. Our service was great, don't get me wrong. For two people who only have a glass of wine and one beer, 85$ is a bit steep to not fully enjoy dinner. On that note, my boyfriend got the bouillabaisse which he said was amazing. For 28$, it should be. I would return for appetizers and a drink or two but the food selection is not for me."},{"name":"Korea House Restaurant","address":"1155 W State Rd 434","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"The food was really good, but I was there but myself and there was only one other table occupied and I still couldn't get my water refilled.

BUT. I ended up super disappointed. This place is overhyped... \\n\\nLet's start with the cons:\\nThe place is extremely small - I felt squished. The wait was almost an hour and there isn't really a place where people can just wait. (There's another Thai place right across the street, which was closed during my visit.) Pricey af especially for the quantity they give you. For example: 6 pieces of their wings for ~$16...\\n\\nService: Slow and horrible. It took them sooooooo long to ask for our order. So our total wait time to be seated + getting our order + getting our food + getting the check was, I want to say, probably close to three hours. They never checked up on our table or refilled our water. A lot of ppl working, too, but it doesn't look like there's teamwork/ good communication. They tried to compensate for horrible-ness with 10 pieces of peanuts? Lol thanks I guess?\\n\\nAmbiance: There will be a lot of chatter, because a lot of older folks in suits love to eat here and just sit and talk and talk which is probably a reason for such a long wait. The bad and slow service and squished seating arrangement gave me a very enhhh feeling to this place. I did not get that Thai/Vietnamese feel to the place at all. Music was... punk rock? Then mixed with other songs? I can't even describe it. \\n\\nI would not suggest this place as a good family sit down spot even though their menu says it's what Pok Pok is about. \\n\\nNo parking lot so good luck finding street parking.\\n\\nOkay on to the goooood:\\nTheir wings were delicious!! It's definitely why Pok Pok is \\"popular.\\" I mean, if you look at the pictures on Yelp, all you'll see are pics of wings. First bite into the chicken def gave me that Ratatouille eating/describing food moment. With the fireworks and etc. Sucks that they only give you a few pieces for such a high price but it was ...worth it. We also ordered their ribs. It tasted sweet and had a lot of meat on the bone. Note: these are not the fall of the bone type of ribs. It came with two sauces a spicy and mild sweet chili sauce. I enjoyed the spicy one a lot! Lastly, we had to get rice. One order of jasmine rice and one order of coconut rice. I've never had coconut rice, and I have to say, it was pretty yummy. Yet, I'm sure I can have a better tasting coconut rice elsewhere. \\n\\nOverall, if you're visiting Pok Pok as part of your Portland to go/do/eat list, I do suggest ordering take out and IF the day is beautiful, find a nice park and have a picnic. Saves you a lot of time and saves you from smelling like fish sauce. \\n\\nYes, order the wings."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I dunno, man.

One very important thing to remember is that this is French-Vietnamese FUSION, not strictly Vietnamese. I love the creative creations, like lamb Bourginone, for example. My dad ordered it last fall and said it was amazing. He ordered it medium spicy and a little extra on the side and thought it was one of the best dishes he had ever ordered in a restaurant. \\n\\nMy husband and I were seated inside (although the outside patio is also very nice - in cooler weather, as there are no fans, and this is August...). The music is a little funky techno-ish, and the servers are all polite and knowledgeable about the menu items. Overall it is a pleasant space and not too noisy. I had the chicken curry with jasmine rice, which was delicious. I ordered it mildly spicy, and it can also be requested medium or very spicy.  My husband got the flat rice vermicelli with pork. He loves how fresh the ingredients are, and the rice wrappers are easy to manipulate. You get a set of flat rice paper wrappers which you soften in warm water, then wrap your ingredients. By the way, we always order spring rolls before our meal- they come with a delicious vinegar-peanut sauce for dipping. Don't plan to share if you are really hungry - you only get two which are cut in halves. (I don't like to share). In addition, Com Dunwoody has a nice wine list (not a long one, but nicely selected) and a really interesting bar menu. Check it out and be pleasantly surprised.

Nori Nori has a hot food section, sushi, soup, and dessert sections(at least at lunch, I'm not sure how it is at dinner). Their hot food section was decent but many of the items just didn't taste good. For instance, my buddy tried the shrimp tempura and the shrimp was cold and the tempura part which is supposed to be light, flaky and crunchy was cold, hard, and whatever the opposite of crunchy is, it was that. The sushi section was decent sized with several types of rolls, however the rolls execution was poor. The freshness and quality of ingredients here just weren't up to par. I wouldn't mind paying more money for better quality for sushi, but oh well. Instead of having nigiri out, they should've had sashimi which they didn't at all which is disappointing.

A couple of their pastry items were good that's about it. They have had a soup section, my friend got the miso soup and said it tasted watered down. I tried their udon, which they prepare for you in a small bowl that has the capacity of 1 metric cup, so yeah it's very small although it was decent.\\n\\noverall experience: 2.5/5.I think buffet's have a bad reputation for low quality food and service. However I try new places to see if they can change my perception, I mean how cool would it be to find a buffet that was actually good? So I came here for lunch today, 2/23/17, after hearing lots of good things.

And its expensive.  The awesome, this place is huge, it takes up the whole block, they have maps at the entrances to help you find what you want and so you don't get lost !!!  They have everything, lots of hard to find stuff, and if you don't find a certain book one day, the next day they might have gotten it in.  There is a cafe so you can refuel , and you can spend a whole day here so you might need to.  Deffinately the best book store I have ever been to.  Now for the expensive part...its expensive !!  A used book you would get for $2 at most used stores, you will pay like $6 for here.  That is the only knock I have on this place, although I will say it doesn't keep me from buying stuff, cause like I said, they have stuff I have a hard time finding elsewhere.  Some tips, use public transportation to get here, not alot of parking around this area, and if you have never been here and you are into books, and you think you will be here an hour.....plan on more like 4 hours.....this place is that cool !!!"},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I was super excited that this place opened up because I live right down the street...and the patio will def be a great place to chill once the weather is pretty.

The grits were really great, but the shrimp, etc. was cooked in a bit too much oil so it made the dish a little extra greasy.  My friend got the egg white omelet, which she said tasted fantastic, but was literally like 2X3 in. big.  For the price, I felt like we got half meals, but it's good for a light brunch.

Came in around 6:30 on a weeknight and there were plenty of tables available. First thing that struck me was the decor: hip, sleek, modern, with lots of open space, which I love. I sat at the bar and treated myself to a light meal.\\n\\nStarted off with the Snug Harbor Smash cocktail. Great, well-balanced drink, especially loved the blend between the rum and lime. The bread that came out with the cayenne-honey butter was very good. Had to stop myself from spreading some more of that salty and sweet butter on the bread, which I hear is also made in-house.\\n\\nYou can't come here without trying oysters. I mean you could, but it's just not right! I sampled a couple: Island Creek, Kumamoto, Misty Point, and Wild Wellfleet. They came out quickly and were all cleanly shucked. My favorites were probably the Kumamoto and Misty Point.\\n\\nI also tried the famed crispy oyster slider, and it was indeed delicious. Nicely cooked, although I would have preferred a little less of the onions and of the lime chili aoili in order to capture the great flavor of the oyster. At $4/slider, maybe a little pricey, but definitely try one if it's your first time there.\\n\\nService was very good-- definitely a step up from the service I received at Neptune Oyster, which I would have to say is maybe their main competition. Also have to love the bigger and more accommodating space.

At this point, much to my dissapointment, so much time had passed that the ride for 2 of my friends had come, and another 2 just decided they had had enough of the drama and would go home. \\n\\nSo 4 of us got seated at a 2-person table.

There wasn't anyone standing up front to greet us but immediately the manager did and asked if we minded waiting while he checked on the tables. Soon after he walked away 2 waiters also asked us if we could be seated/ helped. The customer service was excellent. They made us feel very comfortable.

We were a little taken back by the price of the meals (and yes, also the drinks. lol no cheap beers here). $10 for an open sandwich which our waiter informed us not to get because although he said they were very good, they were also very small. Our waiter also had what I think was a french accent so that just added to the vibe that poured out of the walls here. Very nice. We finally decided on 2 filets. They were beyond delicious!!! One of the best steaks I had in a long time, also one of the pricier ones ($20 a piece for a steak and some french fries) It's not Outback though so I can't argue and it was d**m good. Did I mention that? It was gooood. lol \\n\\nAll in all I suppose I should give the Globe 5 stars because I loved the vibe, the employees were extremely friendly and on top of their game, and the food was great. Our bill ran about $80 or so which isn't technically bad but not inexpensive either considering we were just gonna grab a bite to eat, hop into Blockbuster, and head home for a pretty tame evening.

We went to the bar across the street and had a drink. The host called us and told us they were ready for us. We got our table and when we met our server Grey or Greg he didn't seem to happy. He looked very moody. We ordered our drinks and I tell you the lady bartender had more energy than the server we had all night. We ordered the catfish dish (that was mentioned that it is a must try), the fish sauce wings and the game hen with side of papaya. The catfish was plain, the fish sauce was to salty for my taste but my boyfriend thought it was good. The game hen was nothing special but the papaya salad was decent. The server checked up on us once and that was fine with us because I don't like to be checked on a lot. I felt like the food and service was okay. I probably wouldn't come here again.

This consists of a couple eggs whipped up, flipped and wrapped with some very thin bacon (paper thin) with a couple pieces of processed cheese in the middle. On the side was some decent home fries that thankfully didn't seem to be from a freezer and two pieces of toast.

What did come to mind are the exotic vibrant spice and goodness of coconut milk, peanuts, curry, garlic, tamarind, turmeric, parsnip, fish sauce, chili paste, coriander root, lime, cilantro, mint, and lemongrass.  Now if you have a tingle of inclination towards these ingredients that make Thai food unique along with lastly but most importantly \\"the heat\\" of Thailand, by that i mean literally loving to have a delicious mouth-watering experience, you will not only love Pok Pok, but you will remember the flavors that will challenge and expand your palate.  You will taste, not only Thailand, but influences of Burma, Vietnam, China, and even regionally Chiang Mai, using the best ingredients the Pacific Northwest has to offer, from Carlton Farms pork loin to Cascade Natural flank steak to lastly and least known locally grown fiddlehead ferns.\\n\\nAnd if you can't handle the heat, the Whiskey soda lounge gives more than enough variety of drinks to cool you off.

No where is the pool very deep at all though. If laps are your thing, I don't think you will like it. \\n\\nI loved the look of the provided coffee/tea chest and complimentary spice cookies. You will need the provided bottled water because Orlando has terrible tasting water, so it was very smart of them to provide bottles.

My favorite sandwich is the philly seitan. Processed soy cheeses win over few eaters, so I'm thrilled that proprietress Sue has created a savory and satisfying cashew cheese to punctuate the Philly Seitan. Another treat available during special events are the mini corn dogs. The batter for the dogs was well spiced and enjoyable to my omnivore mom as well as myself, a vegan who hadn't had a corny dog in a very long time. The PacMan Ceasar Salad has a compulsively edible dressing. I don't know what's in it - no fishy stuff that's for sure. Hyuck Hyuck. Another tasty morsel is the raw donut hole - a healthful sweet to cap off a tasty meal.

We found this place by mistake and came across it on our way to Fredericksberg.  My husband and I didn't want to stop for fast food and he found this little spot on Yelp (YAY Yelp!)\\n\\nIt throws you off a bit once you walk in as you are literally walking into small library, but the owner was great and greeted us immediately!  We sat down and the service was on point!  It seems like a small family establishment with everyone helping out anywhere they can.  The place had about 12 tables each sitting about 4 people.  This is definitely made for those that are stopping for a quick bite to eat.\\n\\nThe menu is extensive, but not overwhelming.  I had the liver and onions (which I never normally get, but something told me to try it here) and my husband had a plate off of their all day breakfast menu!  The food was AMAZING!  They are very generous about their portions and the owner stopped by more than once to make sure we were doing alright.\\n\\nI had the chicken fried corn for one of my sides, which is just a corn on the cob battered and fried which was unique, but not mind blowing.  The liver and onions were great!  Very meaty... not gritty...\\n\\nMy husband thoroughly enjoyed his breakfast plate as it disappeared faster than I could get a good look at it.  The biscuits looked homemade and fresh and my husband is a bread snob... so when he says \\"wow\\" I believe him :)\\n\\nBefore leaving we stopped at the restrooms and for some mom and pop shops, the restrooms are an afterthought.  This place was so clean and HUGE!  It gives you enough room to change if you need to and a counter top to place your bags or even change a baby if you need to.

That's an insane deal! \\nSecond - Its HALAL! \\nThird - Service\\n\\nYou have to review this place and walk in expecting a hole in the wall style Indian restaurant in Cambridge. From that perspective it is 5 stars - very clean and everything is great. \\n\\nI tried everything. \\nThe bhendi masala or OKRA was one of my favorites, they did the dish justice in terms of complimenting the flavor of the okra with other veggies. Also the paneer with peas or matter paneer masala, not too spicey but will balanced with more of a liquid curry base.  I am a harsh chicken tikka masala critic and this one was AMAZING! Perfect balance of flavor and chicken. It wasn't too watered down and the chicken wasn't just chunks of white breast meat. It tasted like real chicken and you can tell looking at the curry there were multiple ingredients used.  Also the tandoori chicken pieces?! They were certainly well marinated before hitting the grill. Too many places do not marinate the chicken and just use bright red food coloring, not here though. The chicken leans more pinkish but the spices are all there. There was also another creative chicken dish which resembled chicken jalfrezi with onions and peppers, also quite good.\\n\\nI have zero negative comments about this place. I also give thanks to the server who was so friendly when I asked to buy a cup of masala chai to go he told me I could take a cup on the house! He seemed shocked I would even ask and encouraged me to take more. He asked me my opinion of the food. Also When I bought samosas to go for my boos he included three different sauces and a PAPADUM for just $3.25! Wrapped in a box, foil, brown bag, and plastic bag!

We chose to sit upstairs, which has a stiffer, quieter, more French ambiance than the bar area downstairs.\\n\\nWe were quickly seated and brought menus. After consulting the very very extensive wine menu, we settled on a couple bottles of wine and then turned to the food. I ordered the Grilled Spanish Octopus, Baked Hake, and the scoops of White Peach and Coconut sorbet. The staff first brought out some bread, which was good, and then the appetizers. My octopus was delicious! I loved the consistency and the eggplant sauce that was on it. The presentation was lovely and I could've eaten way more of it. \\n\\nBefore getting the entrees, one coworker had to take a phone call. To be super polite, the restaurant staff wanted to wait for him to come back before serving the entire table. However, he took a while so they ended up serving ours first. When he got back, they made him an entirely new entree since they wanted it to be very fresh. Unnecessary, but really nice. I enjoyed my Hake, which was well-seasoned by the lobster consomme and perfectly cooked. The massive prawn was also fantastic. Although we were pretty full, we ended up ordering dessert. I had a scoop of white peach and coconut sorbet. The white peach sorbet tasted more like regular peach and the servings were very small, but I needed a little something that was cold and sweet so it worked perfectly.

The decor is gorg - feels like you're in an izakaya in Tokyo. That is probably because it is actually a chain restaurant from Japan. I like the booths with the foamy cushions that give you the feeling of sitting in a tatami room but without the sore knees (they have authentic tatami rooms too). You do have to know what to order at this place. Anything from the grill is delish, especially the shiitake mushrooms. Their tonkotsu ramen is pretty darned good - next time I'll add butter and corn to the mix as well. The sushi is just o.k. Some of the food is so-so (katsu curry for example) and a bit overpriced.

As for the kids!.....they were able to make their own pancakes and select  the toppings and fillings of their choice.  We didn't think it was high priced at all.  For $6 you get 8 ounces of pancake batter, which made so many pancakes of varying sizes.  Then they ordered bananas and chocolate chips.  It was the right amount of toppings for them, and then they had coconut syrup and maple on top.  They both loved the experience of designing the shape of their pancake.

They have 5 different types of sashimi: salmon, white tuna, red snapper, surf clams, and regular tuna. All of which was decently good quality. They also served nigari (fish on rice) of all the previous sashimi types as well as eel, squid, and razer clams. super tasty. \\n\\nFor the hot foods, there were king crab legs, steak, chicken and beef teriyaki, roasted salmon, clams, mussels and your obligatory fried rice, just to name a few. The salads were all pretty tasty and fresh. The dessert for dinner was top notch. All of it seemed to be made in house, and all were served in small portions so you could try it all out without feeling guilty. The unique thing they have for dinner is a crepe bar, which I definitely used a few times with my friend. (word of advice, the less fancy you are with your crepe, the better it will turn out). The crepes were well made and didnt fall apart the instant you cut into it. \\n\\nAll in all, definitely worth the 26 dollars or so. My favorite dishes there (besides the fantastic sashimi and sushi) would be the sliced steak from the hibachi grill, the chicken teriyaki, and the cream puff from the desserts. (PS my favorite sashimi there are the white tuna and the eel). Don't forget to sign up for the card. Its free of charge, (basically no downside except for a fatter wallet), you eventually get a free meal, and you get to go free on your birthday. I probably will."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Obviously, it isn't as good as home cooked vegan food, but for a food stand it's pretty darn good.

The food can be bland, but you can always season to taste.\\n\\nI saw someone say the Jackfruit BBQ was mushy - you must have gotten a bad sandwich! Mine was crunchy goodness. The Philly Seitan is definitely the one you need to try, though. And the bruschetta... *sigh*\\n\\nThe best part is when you're done. You feel full, but not heavy, and energetic - like you consumed calories your body can efficiently utilize for energy.

This place can definitely accommodate large groups. definitely come early to get seated fast. Your whole group does not have to be there at once for you to get seated. Noise level is average, not too loud. \\n\\nService: Fast, efficient. A-ok!\\n\\nFood: I had the LUNCH buffet. This is a large buffet with hot food options as well as plenty of sushi options. There's a fresh hibachi grill, lots and lots of sushi (both cooked and raw), kalbi/bulgogi, amazing fried rice, crab cakes, wings, friend shrimp, etc. There is also a nice sized salad buffet with pre-mixed salads incl. seaweed salad. There is a soft-serve ice cream machine with vanilla and green tea flavors with cones. There is a decent sized dessert buffet, but they don't do a good job with replenishing their dessert station as well as their ice cream cones. Their sushi is pretty good for a buffet and no they do not stuff their sushi with lots of rice. Their hot food items are also very good, especially their crab cakes, fried rice and korean chicken. Because of the sheer volume of people, the hot food and sushi gets replenished fairly quickly, so nothing is sitting out for an unsafe amount of time. \\n\\nPrice: lunch was about 20 dollars per person, so definitely come if you want variety or are super hungry! \\n\\nOverall: Great for both sushi and non-sushi asian food lovers, easy seating, good for groups, good dessert, fairly priced sushi buffet. I would say this sushi buffet is pretty good and I've had the king of all buffets (the Baccanal dinner buffet at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas).

Most Portable Poboy and Best Dressed Poboy.\\n\\nMost places don't completely \\"dress\\" their poboys. The sauce is on the side. There's no pickles. There are tomatoes sticking out of places so that you wonder how one actually eats their sammich. This place gets it right. two sauces on their bread, lettuce, tomato and pickles all nestled into the bread without displacing the meat of the sammich.\\n\\nMost places also don't have what I'd call a Portable PoBoy. They overstuff with vegetables or seafood, making it impossible to actually pick the sammich up without it falling apart.\\n\\nI had to get my order to-go, since the counter guy told me that Darque Tan would likely tow me if I didn't move it immediately. So, on the way home, I decided that if I can organize a burlesque show I can certainly dodge coeds whilst trying to eat a PoBoy. I wanted to eat it as soon as possible to give them a fair shake, after all. Amazingly, I dropped not a single crawfish tail while eating at a couple of red lights. \\n\\nThe crawfish were of the smaller variety. Mama Roux blows them out of the water in this area. The breading was just right, though. The bread, lettuce and tomato were all fresh tasting. The pickles were a nice touch. The sauces provided a nice flavor to round out the experience. For just less than $10 with fries and a drink, I'd say this one's a winner.  \\n\\nI can't wait to find out how their Mediterranean food is. It all looks delicious. I wish I'd known you can get a mediterranean side dish subbed in for the fries for a buck extra.

The food was fresh and well prepared. The service was attentive. The price was high, but it always felt like a worthwhile experience. Unfortunately, my most recent experience was really bad. I didn't just come straight here and bash them; I contacted them first and explained the situation in the email that I have pasted below. For some reason they chose not to respond. I still wanted to work things out with them rather than condemning them publicly so after five days of no response I followed up. They still didn't respond. Below I have copied the emails that I sent to C&S. (I made a couple small tweaks to them so they will make more sense to an outsider.)\\n\\n\\n============\\n\\n\\n\\"Hello, \\n\\nWhile I don't live in the area, for special occasions I'm happy to make the drive to C&S to for an exceptional meal. Unfortunately, last night's meal (December 27, 2013) was not exceptional in service or food.\\nIt took our waiter an extended period of time to acknowledge us, probably because he was busy drinking and goofing off with other tables. He couldn't help us with selecting the oysters on offer and we ended up getting very different types of oysters than we asked for. We wanted small, briny and minerally and got just the opposite.\\n\\nI didn't get the beer that I ordered when we were finally first acknowledged until after we finished our oysters. This beer was served with more than 60% foam in the glass. The server said something about topping it off, but never did, probably because he was too busy drinking and goofing off with other tables.\\nOur entrees were not up to the usual C&S standards. The Parmesan-crusted flounder was burned on the bottom (see Rachael W's review on here for more on that dish) and the crab in the stuffed shrimp was a bit off, not so terribly that I thought I would be sick, but still somewhat unpleasant and far from what I expected from a restaurant of C&S's caliber. Our waiter wouldn't know because he never checked on us, probably because he was busy drinking and goofing off with other tables.\\n\\nOur bill for two entrees, 9 oysters, 1 soft drink and a (half full and flat) beer was $97. That would be a fine value had the food and service been at its usual quality. However, the neglectful service and carelessly assembled food resulted in a disappointing dining experience at C&S.\\n\\nThank you for your time.\\"\\n\\n\\n============\\n\\n\\nI waited five days after sending that email and received no response. I really didn't want go public with my complaint if it was just an off night and they were willing to make it right, so I followed up with the email below. I then waited another day before posting this publicly. If they don't care enough to try to make things right with a disgruntled customer, I suppose they don't mind this kind of \\"publicity\\" on social media. \\n\\n\\n=============\\n\\n\\n\\"Hello, \\n\\nI sent the email above 5 days ago and the (lack of) response has been more apathetic than the service and food preparation at my disappointing recent C&S experience. \\n\\nI tried to be respectful and give C&S management the opportunity to respond to my situation before going public with my review. Since C&S has chosen to ignore my email I will be posting it on Open Table and Yelp with an explanation that C&S was given the chance to respond before I went public. \\nI'm truly sad that C&S has shown such lack of concern as I had been a longtime fan. I will miss the good food and service that I had previously experienced, but I will not spend my money on bad service, mediocre food, half-filled beverages and disinterested customer service.\\" \\n\\n\\n=====\\n\\n\\nI know it's the holiday season and things can go a bit differently than the rest of the year, but this was a special post-holiday meal for my husband and me and we were given no reason to expect anything less than the usual high quality food and service for which C&S are known. Also, is there some reason they don't answer email for a full week during this time of year?\\n\\nI won't be returning to C&S. In the future my money will go to any of the places in town (Kimball House, Fontaines, Atlanta Fish Market, Shucks, Goin' Coastal, The Optimist, even Bonefish and Steamhouse Lounge) that have repeatedly proven that they value my money and time more than C&S."},{"name":"Burtons Grill","address":"1363 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"i've only ever had great food here (3 visits.)\\n\\nthe last time, i was so incredibly impressed with the service.  so important.\\n\\nmushroom ravioli and the crab lobster whatever pasta were both delicious (and i even hate mushrooms).\\n\\nget the ravioli."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"What is there to say that hasn't already been said in the 4000 reviews lol? This place lived up to the hype; the place itself is cute, really feels like a bungalow you'd find in Thailand and their menu has a ton of options. Service is great, and the food itself has the right flavor and spices to feel authentic despite being in the middle of Portland. We ordered the wings (as does everyone), the pork belly stew and the flank steak salad and it was great. My only qualms were the portion size relative to the price (15 dollars for the salad which wasn't that huge), there was a tad bit too much citrus that started to overpower the dish, and rice you had to purchase extra despite it being crucial to a stew, but they did provide plenty of meat and I was plenty full at the end. If they came down a bit price wise the place would be 5 stars for sure. Not sure my check book could handle this place that often (75 dollars for 2 ppl). Otherwise definitely worth the visit."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"If you're like me, just the thought of a sushi buffet is enough to bring questions of quality control to your mind. Most of us have been to various Asian buffets around Atlanta where sushi was available, and usually these experiences serve to disappoint on a grand scale. Not so with Nori Nori!\\n\\nI've been to Nori Nori at least 10 times since I first discovered this truly amazing journey into Japanese cuisine. In that time, I have never had a service problem, nor a quality problem. The food is always exceptional and the sushi unbelievably fresh! It's all enough to make one wonder how they do it for the affordable price? The variety of rolls is enough to cover anyone's particular taste and preference. The sushi selection is also as expansive. There is even a selection of at least four kinds of sashimi. For those who prefer cooked food, there is a wide range of Japanese/Asian style dishes from tempura to hibachi grill (cooked to order).\\n  \\nSome of my personal running favorites from the cooked food section are the snow crab legs, oysters Rockefeller, the grilled squid, and the short ribs. From the hibachi grill I usually get the scallops. From the soup bar, I usually get the noodles with everything on them. Of course, all of this only comes second to the sushi and sashimi! Additional favorites of mine, when I can find the room, are the raw oysters, smoked salmon, and the seaweed salad. Essentially, it's hard to go wrong with this place. There is even a fresh crepes station for dessert.\\n\\nAs I previously mentioned, the service is top of the line for a buffet. I always leave a full 20% tip, versus my usual $2-$3 for buffets. The restaurant has a nice, friendly atmosphere, and the restaurant is immaculate. My only real word of caution is to stay away from weekends. They charge more for the same items you get during the week and the crowds make it very unpleasant while everyone rushes to raid the food stations. Go during the week and at night. It will be the all-you-can-eat experience of a lifetime!"},{"name":"C&S Seafood & Oyster Bar","address":"3240 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 118","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great oysters every time I visit.

We came across Ajitaro and decided to eat here. Japanese food seems good at any time of day so why not. We were seated soon after we got inside. We waited a while before our server came to get our orders which was a little annoying, considering how hungry we were. She took our orders of katsu-don and teri-beef son. My brother's katsu-don came out fairly quickly but then mine and my uncle's teri-beef don didn't come out for more than 20 minutes. It took so long because they forgot about our orders. The server went to the back to ask about our others and it wasn't even made and so we could see the chef scramble through the window to make our dish. Our dish came out fairly quickly afterwards, but it wasn't very good. My brother's katsu-don looked really good and everything was made well but my teri-don wasn't made well. For whatever reason, my rice was oily, more than the amount that would come off the beef. The texture and taste of the rice was bad while my brother's was fine. I don't know if it's the dish itself or that the chef rushed it, but the teri-beef don sucked. I don't know what miscommunication occurred between the server and the kitchen for the almost missed order, but I didn't have such a good experience here and my food wasn't good.

Sure enough, after a game of kick ball I asked that we try out The Nook instead of grabbing fast food Mexican. Everyone was hesitant until I mentioned the menu full of tater tots. You really just can't go wrong with tater tots. You know you loved them as a kid, and you know you still love them now.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty extensive for such a small place, and the portions are plenty large. The signature, unique dishes to this place ARE the tater tots... which are called \\"totchos.\\" Totchos combine the best of both worlds: tater tots (which we've already declared awesome) and nachos. There are a few different styles, such as Philly and traditional Nacho. So far, all have been great! You can even order a side of tots and add just one or two ingredients. At 50 cents a piece, that's really not a bad deal if you're only wanting cheese. I've also had the mac and cheese (good) and the house salad (great dressing!). You really can't seem to go wrong if you're wanting a bite to eat!\\n\\nI admit that I've not really explored the beer selection here. Coming after a kick ball game and being hot and sweaty, that's probably the last thing on my mind. Everyone else on my team enjoyed the $1 beer on Sundays, though, which gets you a large plastic cup full of whatever the $1 beer on tap is for the night. Great deal! I did go for a fish bowl with friends and can highly recommend the Drunken Astronaut. Remember how I said you loved tots as a kid? Remember how much you also loved Tang? Imagine a fishbowl full of tang and berry vodka - a childhood memory gone so wrong that it's so good.\\n\\nI've always found ample parking around the park, so I've never had an issue with that. It's probably easier if you really know the area and all the best free streets to park on, so there's not really a good reason to use the lot unless you need to be closer for physical reasons. There's never been too long of a wait, and the staff is more than willing to let us see just how many people can we cram into a booth.\\n\\nAll in all, a delicious meal made of tatchos and a fishbowl.

I actually went in with no expectations, but hopeful. However,  by the time I left, my only hope was that I never go back. I got the rack of ribs and they were just awful. The meat was very dry and I struggled to even cut it let alone chew it. The sauce that was on the ribs was very tangy and overpowering. Bottom line, the ribs were an abject failure. The sweet potato fries were under cooked. The potatoes in the potato salad were too. Also, the taste was off yet I can't quite put my finger on why. My wife got a Caesar salad that was just ok. On top of the food issues, our waiter was not very pleasant. He seemed like he couldn't be bothered with us, though his level of attentiveness was adequate. It really ticked me off when he brought the check and never said a word about my barely eaten ribs. Then when he ran my card, he just tossed the bill on the table and walked away without a word. I guess he wasn't angling to save any face. Like I said, he didn't seem to care. As for the atmosphere, it was pretty loud, but I expected that so I'm not knocking it. Lastly, aside from being right across from Fenway, there's nothing special about it whatsoever. Yes, it's been there forever, but the place was remodeled at some point so it doesn't even have the throw back, nostalgia thing going for it.

I pulled the lettuce off and put it next to my plate to tell our waitress Katie when she checked in at our table. So when I discreetly told our waitress Katie, she said, oh, you're right! and threw away the lettuce I had plucked off and placed on the table. She didn't take the sandwich off the bill and  had forgotten to bring us our bill altogether (maybe wrongfully assuming we would not tip; not her fault there was a fruit fly on my sandwich!). My friend had to pick up her son so after waiting around a long time and not seeing our waitress Katie, I had to go inside to the bar and ask the bar tender to get her from the kitchen. So while the interior is nice and the food was really good, the fruit fly and lack of service made me not want to return."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place!

Perfect for a couple of drinks before and after dinner and I think it's brought the value up of the homes in that neighborhood. There is ample indoor or outdoor seating. We sat indoors and I felt like I was transported to a (hip) restaurant in Southeast Asia...but safe and without the fear of getting food poisoning or mugged. \\n\\nFood/Prices: We went to town and ordered 7 plates. I'll try my hardest to remember them. If you want the details, brace yourself and read on. If not, skip to \\"bottom line\\".\\n\\n 1) Cha Ca La Vong $14.00 - Catfish marinated in turmeric and sour sticky rice, fried in turmeric oil with scallions and dill, served on rice vermicelli with peanuts, mint and mam nem. This is a popular Vietnamese dish and if you are familiar with the combination of flavors, this is what you'd expect. They did a great interpretation. 2) Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings $12.00 - Fresh natural chicken wings marinated in fish sauce, garlic and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Phu Quoc fish sauce and garlic and served with Vietnamese table salad. This is, I believe, what Pok Pok is known for and boy was the gossip, indeed, truth! It went beyond what I was expecting and then some. Perfectly (Vietnamese-style) seasoned wings; perfection. 3) Kai Yaang Half Bird $7.00 / Whole Bird $12.00 - Roasted natural game hen rubbed with lemongrass, garlic, pepper and cilantro served with a spicy sweet and sour dipping sauce. Once again, delicious. Tender and perfect flavoring. 4) Muu Sateh $9.00 - Carlton Farms pork loin skewers marinated in coconut milk and turmeric, grilled over charcoal and served with peanut sauce, cucumber relish and grilled bread. We ordered the pork. Again, delicious. Tender and perfect flavoring. 5) Papaya Pok Pok (available vegetarian) $8.00 - Green papaya salad with tomatoes, long beans, Thai chili, lime juice, tamarind, fish sauce, garlic, palm sugar, dried shrimp and peanuts. Not too spicy and perfectly seasoned. Fresh and delicious. 6) Half crab. It was a special and was not on the menu. Moist, sweet crab meat, fresh, flavorful and delicious. \\n\\nBottom line: Food tasted of high quality ingredients, authentic, perfectly seasoned, and tasty; I swear there must have been little old asian women cooking in the kitchen. \\n\\nThey also have a variety of yummy and unique asian inspired cocktails, hard liquor, and whiskies to choose from.\\n\\nService: Fantastic.

Friendly staff, and superior service makes the dining experience something special that you can share with you and your group. This is a Tapas Bar, meaning that its smaller entrees that are ordered in numbers (for the purpose of sharing). The way we did it was that each bought 2 tapas (for a total of 10 between the group). They brought them out one or two at a time so that you have time to share. Every single dish was one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life. We've got a friend that is a heavy and picky eater (who usually never shares his food and lacks a diverse food pallet), and he absolutely loved the place. He didn't mind sharing because he knew that the next dish to come out was going to be just as good if not better than the last.

I've always found the portions wanting, the bread stale, and the staff friendly but not terribly knowledgeable.

My husband could not stop exclaiming how incredibly wonderful it was. \\n- the decor. After hearing that the restaurant runs a mainly takeout business, I was worried it would have a Bottega-like picnic table set up (shudder). But, they had a number of tables and we had no problem getting a seat right away at 8:00 pm on a Saturday night.\\n\\nWhat could be improved: \\n- the pesto was good (hello garlic!) and there was a lot of it but it was very, very oily. Next time, I would buy the pesto to go and then I could portion out how much I wanted. \\n- the pasta was a bit overcooked and certainly not al dente \\n- we were asked if we wanted \\"cheese on top\\" of our entrees. I figured this meant some grated parmigiana. Apparently, it meant a very generous portion of something softer (perhaps mozzarella?).

Fluffy, light and eggy and not a lick of oil to be seen anywhere.

I thought for sure it would be better than the jackfruit. This was not the case.. it barely had any flavor. I'm not sure either how moist seitan is supposed to be, but I thought it was pretty dry. \\nRaw donut hole - covered with finely chopped nuts (walnuts?) and coconut.

A long winded review of the process follows:\\n\\nAfter I submitted a request on their website for a private space for our group on a Saturday, I heard back from a Private Dining Sales Manager (Sheila) that Monday.  She was helpful and accommodating.  She made it easy to pick a menu, customize the evening with special touches, and assured me that guests would be taken care of for dietary necessities.  She provided menu enhancement opportunities (pre dinner hors d'oeuvres, for example) but wasn't pushy in the slightest.  The process was relatively simple and seamless. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were actually 17 guests instead of 16 but the staff handled that quickly and without any fuss.  The private space was beautiful and overlooked the Common.  Drinks came fast and were well made, the timing on the food was perfect, and it was delicious.  If there was one negative I heard from my guests, it would be that some portions were a little on the smaller side (tuna tartar), but I think you expect that in a fine dining French restaurant.  People left satisfied, if not stuffed.\\n\\nThe real star of the evening was the service.  Waiters took special care of the four members in our party who had dietary restrictions (one dairy free, one gluten free, and two vegetarians).  I was seated next to the individual with the dairy allergy and when his main course arrived, he turned to me and said \\"I'm not sure what those white drops are, do you think it might have cream?\\"  Almost before he finished the sentence, the waiter was over his shoulder to explain what those drops were and that the dish was absolutely dairy free.

What's not to love about swanky home cooking? However last  night I took several clients out for dinner and we were all less than impresssed. \\n\\nFor starters we had the calamari, which while served nicely crisped, was overwhelmingly salty. My mouth puckered it was so doused in sodium. We also ordered the homemade potato chips, and while they were cooked well, the gross warm sour cream sauce was stomach turning.\\n\\nFor \\"supper\\" I ordered the broiled trout with polenta cake. The trout was swimming in salt!! My feet were literally swelling out of my high heels and I had to take them off. My eyes were puffing and my wedding band was getting tighter and tighter around my finger. Salt is a lazy chefs crutch! My polenta cake was hard and dry and served with a marinara sauce that tased like Ragu from the jar. My other companions had the chicken almondine- again, salty and swimming in butter. The Waldorf salad got good reviews and the BBQ Dr. Pepper chicken was very dry. The winner of the bunch was the chicken fried steak with mac n' cheese, but this was also overly salted.\\n\\nThe highlight of the night was the warm fudge brownie that was easily shared among the 6 of us, but I left the restaurant doubting I will return. After gulping down over a liter of water before bed, I still woke up looking swollen and puffy. I suppose my honeymoon with Moonshine is now over and we've settled into a mediocre and unfullfilling existence, so I think I need to ask for a divorce and move on."},{"name":"Clay Oven Indian Cuisine","address":"7696 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Good but pricey food.

My friend had just gotten a tattoo a couple of hours earlier, so we decided it would be best for her if we waited for an indoor table.  We send a friend back in to get a pager and he comes back out...about 30 seconds later a guy comes out looking really annoyed and says \\"The hostess said for ya'll to come inside...she has a table ready for you.\\"  \\n\\nSo, we go inside and ask her if our table is ready and she looks at us like we're insane (seriously...I'm not exaggerating) and then says in the most belittling tone  \\"No.  You have to wait here.

The short ribs that come with the dish are tasty, but overpower the lobster a bit I think. The fried oyster slider appetizer was good as well.

My only complaint about the sushi is that the rice is pumped out from a machine so it tends to be stiff and less than stellar. That's why I stick to the sashimi. Most of the rolls are good, but watch out! Some of them are funky. Perhaps I'm a prude because I don't like mango in my sushi rolls. Whatever floats your boat.

It's a very busy place but the service leaves much to be desired. Rushed and they never returned to our table. We explained we wanted to share food, but we were not brought any plate or utensils. I'm fond of tempura but skip it here as mine was limp instead of crispy and tho it was supposed to have a sauce added, none could be found and the rices was lumpy under the tempura.  Chicken wings were good and crispy.

There are some other things on the menu that are good, like there's a bok choy dish that's good, and another vegetarian dish (don't recall what it was) that was also good, but mostly I just get the duck and I'm happy.

I think they could switch up the dip to a more tzaziki-like dip and try making it without batter. The lamb souvlaki was yummy! The lamb was very tender & well-cooked accompanied by potatoes & rice. I would reduce the amount of carbs & increase the amount of meat in the dish. As for drinks, the house wine was very reasonably priced at $5/glass. However, it was bubbles that I craved. They did not serve this by the glass, but said they plan to refine the drink menu in about a week's time. They will have more options, including drinks with bubbles. I would return.

We also split the pepproni with hot pepper flatbread which was properly cooked and very tasty hit on flavor points. Only downside was when pulling apart the pieces the toppings came right off.

We also read so many great reviews about the huevos rancheros we ordered those, the chicken fried bacon, and made our own pancakes.  The pancakes we made were the best item.  I was not in the love with the bacon - it was definitely made earlier in the day and slightly reheated which was not good so maybe if you came at a time it is fresh it would taste better?

The first few bites were good but after the first wing it was just way too salty. The pickled veggies on the side were okay. The worst part was the sausage plate we ordered. $15 bucks for ONE sausage cut into 7 pieces with half a cabbage, string beans tied into knots, pork rinds, mushy squash, and mints!! That plate just sucked! How are you going to advertise \\"family style dining\\" and give us ONE sausage!? The Thai coffee had a sour taste to it. Sticky rice was the size of my palm for $3. The best part of the meal was the spicy peanuts they give you to start with....\\n\\nI seriously blame their style of menus they give because it's a list of small font and no visuals of what the food will look like. \\n\\nTerrible prices for salty small portioned food.

I can tell they are doing this to promote a relaxed vibe and probably to make it simpler to just charge all you've ordered in bits and pieces over several hours at the end instead of as you go.  But sometimes they do ring me up in the beginning, and I'd appreciate just paying for things as I get them.  Familiarity makes the experience more accessible. \\n\\nThere's also quite a bit of variability in terms of customer service.  Sometimes the staff is proactive about greeting you and helping you pick out a game, set it up, explain the rules...and sometimes you have to ask.  Which isn't that bad, but depending on the person, it can feel like you are disturbing them since they are often sitting at a table playing a game themselves.  So it can make people feel uncomfortable to interact with the staff and get the full enjoyment of the experience.  Even just being more alert as they are playing or chatting, and asking anyone standing around the register if they need assistance would help. I don't think anyone needs to be dedicated to walking around the tables or standing behind the counter.\\n\\nI think that for a relatively new business, they are doing well, and they bring a unique way to have fun in the Brookline area.  I hope they continue to grow their customer base, and hopefully these comments help streamline their practices. :)"},{"name":"Thuyen Vien","address":"Mills 50 1216 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Went there for lunch today with a vegetarian friend.

From the outside, the only thing that announces it is the name on the awning; inside, it's clear that the space used to be a deli.\\n\\nThis first impression makes one's surprise at the ambition of the food all the more enjoyable.  The menu is equally split between what one might term 'modern American' cuisine, mostly in the form of sandwiches, salads, and soup, and pretty much straight-up Korean dishes, reflecting the diverse heritages of the husband-and-wife team that run the place and prepare the food.  (It's worth noting that the husband of the pair, Paul Yow, used to be the executive chef at Barcelona.)\\n\\nWe went on a cold, rainy day, and consequently opted for the Korean dishes (sandwiches never appeal to me in the winter).  The jap chae was well-prepared and true-to-form, accompanied by kim chee and a homemade beet salad.  As I've mentioned in other reviews, sometimes it's the details that set a dish apart; in this case, that accompaniment of the pickled beet and watercress made run-of-the-mill jap chae something entirely distinctive.\\n\\nWe also got one of the specials, a mung bean pancake with broiled cod.  Basically that traditional Korean seafood pancake you would find elsewhere, again that attention to detail - in this case the broiled cod - made the dish something entirely unique.\\n\\nNormally we don't do dessert at lunch, but when the server went through the list, we couldn't turn down the white chocolate mousse with pomegranate seeds and dark chocolate.

I felt like Pokpok took me back there. The papaya and long green bean salad was so good, very flavorful and fairly spicy, served like you would get on the beach. The fatty braised pork was good, but this dish, like the others, were really small. Pretty much everything on their menu was good. It was pricey, though, relative to the other Thai places in town. I thought it was worth it, still. The wait is annoyingly long though, unless you get there right as it opens or have reservations; I did these things for both occasions.\\n\\nThe second time was strange. It was greasier and bland. What the hell, it left me confused considering my experience the first time. By this point, I had tried just about every dish on their menu including the special dishes (boar, giant crispy fish, etc) -- we had a group of 14 and order way too many entrees -- and was completely underwhelmed. The only good thing was that the Vietnamese wings were still good, kinda like how my mama makes it. And by mama, I mean actual bar/street food in Vietnam. Their drinks were also still good.\\n\\nSo, I still leave this at 5 stars, praying that my second experience was an anomaly. Pokpok also offers too many dishes prepared in a way that isn't common in other Thai places in Portland, and so, sadly, because I won't be back in Bangkok for a while, Pokpok is as good as it gets."},{"name":"Basta Pasta Trattoria","address":"319 Western Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"My go-to pasta place.

We have been big on trying new places and after googling a few things, we ended up at Kevin Rathbun Steak. When we arrived, we were seated quickly (thanks to a reservation via Open Table) and our waitress was at our table shortly there after. We started off w. the thick-cut siracha bacon, which was absolutely delicious. We sopped up the sauce w. the focaccia from the plate of fresh bread placed on our table. We followed that with the steak for 2, creamed spinach, jalapeno corn, and au gratin sweet potatoes. \\n\\nThe steak was perfectly cooked ....sliced in the kitchen & presented at our table. After looking over and approving the doneness, we were served slices on pre warmed plates, doused in au juis. The sides were large enough to share (with a modest portion to still take home). All the food was just delicious. The steak was simply seasoned...well salted and seared. Tender, juicy, and delicious. The sides were stand outs on their own .... jalapeno cream corn was divine, the creamed spinach was classic and velvety, the sweet potatoes were the obvious standout .... a mix of sweet potatoe and white potato in a cheesy cream sauce. The only downside of the meal was probably the house steak sauce ... not that it was bad, it just wasn't necessary...so we ended up not using it. My husband had also ordered the seared scallops ....which he enjoyed. We finished our meal w. the salted caramel bon bons. All in all ... our server was appropriately attentive ...she checked in periodically, she silently & seamlessly refilled our drink as needed, she was perfectly in place without distracting from our time together. \\n\\nThe overall ambiance is a bit loud....but they have a handful of intimate booths and nooks to tuck away in and be intimate either w. another person or a group of people. It's dim and intimate ....it feels very rich and luxurious without being gaudy or pretentious. The attire is upscale casual so you don't need a suit and tie (although I saw plenty of suits and loosened up ties at the bar). The price point is pretty high end but not overly so. Our check topped off at about $190.00 before tip, I would think adding in wine or liquor would drive that up easily over the $200.00 range. Appetizers are in the $9.00 to $25.00 range .... entrees are from about $18.00 (for a wagu beef burger) up to $120+ for a dry aged steak. The sides are $9.00 each, and they're easily split between 2-3 people. (so ordering a few for the table offsets some of that cost). I don't have much insight in the way of wine (I drank tea...unsweetened but they bring a small decanter of simple syrup for you to self sweeten) but the liquor selection on the dessert menu ranged from $10.00 to over a $100. Expect at least an entry of $150.00 a couple, bare minimum and go up from there. \\n\\nAll in all .... 100% worth it. Completely, 100% worth it."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best meal we had in portland.

You make the final decision.\\"\\n\\nFirst of all when it comes to food, I hate making decisions.  I want to eat it all.  If I could, I would combine all world cuisines in one central area and cut them into little pieces, enough to savor, but small enough for variety.\\n\\nBut life is about decisions.  And thus after doing due diligence on Yelp, I finally went with Baraka Cafe.  I was feeling adventurous--African food was outside my comfort zone.\\n\\nIt's hard for me to judge the food because it was so exotic.  Deciding to take advantage of the cheap small plates, we went with the Bekloula, Zaatar Coca, and Bedenjal Mechoui.  The zaatar coca, a hand-stretched flatbread with caramelized onions, was delicious.  The onions had a sweet, tangy flavor, and the wonderful aroma of sesame seeds.  The bekloula was an ordinary salad; the dressing a tint above average.  Meanwhile, the Bedenjal was a huge hit-- the eggplant and olive oil--served cold--really complemented the thin pieces of flatbread.  And lemonade?  It's embedded with a taste of herbs, so subtle that when don't pay attention, it's gone.  \\n\\nThe service was disappointing in that the waiter messed up our order, giving us Karentika (the savory custard was just too foreign to my not completely diversified tongue) instead of Zaatar Coca, and then getting angry and charging us for both.  That was what brought it down to three stars.  The food was exotic but made with enough care and detail to be worthy of praise; the cute interior was heartwarming and a perfect place to catch up after an entire summer.  But the tension in service brings it down.  The bad apple spoils the basket.

I ordered the fettuccine with shrimp. It was ok, but definitely wasn't oh my God amazing. Friends got mussels and thought they were good. The mussels pasta with red sauce was ok.

We were seated after about 10 minutes, which wasn't bad at all considering that the restaurant is so small. The tables are close together, you can see where the food is prepared three feet from where you sit, you drink your wine out of plastic cups and the menu is written on a blackboard on the wall - the epitome of a home in the wall restaurant. Needless to say, we were SO excited to eat, as all of this usually makes for the perfect storm that is amazing food. However, I am sad to say that we were disappointed by our meal. The fried calamari we had as an appetizer was chewy, We also got the famous $80 lobster dish that we heard so much on Yelp, and again, for $40 a person, were let down. The sauce tasted like watered down tomatoes and the pasta was overcooked and chewy. The seafood itself was fresh, but the way it was prepared definitely did not do the food justice and was not worth the price or the hype.

My first time here, I met up with Kathleen M. for a quick meal and a drink.  In the past few years, I've noticed that the once-sad dearth of restaurants serving tater tots is now becoming a surplus. Thus, following a quick perusal of the menu lead us to sample the totchos, the cleverly-named-yet-far-too-small-for-the-price amalgam of nachos and tater tots.  That evening, I would choose the pulled pork sandwich which was quite tasty.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, my beverage of choice left a lot to be desired--I asked for a Caipirinha, and found the cocktail to be completely devoid of one of the key ingredients--the sugar.  \\n\\nSo when Uncle Randy thought to celebrate his birthday here, I thought it an appropriate time to try the Nook again.  I ordered the Caipirinha again, and this time found it with the requisite sweetness at the bottom of the glass (if I can be pedantic, however, the sugar was completely dissolved in the cocktail).  I would order a burger with tots, and sample a few wings from Gretchen O's plate.  For the most part, both items were passable, but nothing exceedingly special.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was mostly pleasant on the patio.  There was a chill in the air, however, and the heaters provided didn't cover the area with enough heat for everyone.  \\n\\nWe started at a smaller table and ended up splitting into two groups when the numbers in our party became too unruly for a single table.

Finally I tried it recently. Per some yelp reviews I was prepared for a long wait, some pretentiousness and small portions, and overrated food, but I had to see for myself. Maybe it was because my expectations were lowered some but I was happy to find that in my opinion, it definitely still deserves 5 stars! It is a very unique spot, so keeping that in mind some of its eccentricities added to its charm. The whole experience was fun for us. We got there at about 8:30 on a cold and rainy saturday night, but still there was about an hour wait. On the sheltered patio there are heat lamps and picnic tables, so we ordered some drinks out there and huddled up under the heat lamps. The tamarind whiskey sours were great! \\n\\nThe shining star at Pok Pok is obviously the food, and I was very excited to try a style of Thai cuisine that was new to me. Though its been said, I have to echo that the Vietnamese chicken wings were totally amazing and addictive, sweet, salty, sticky, crispy, so full of flavor...I feel anyone who likes chicken and keeps an open mind will love these. The order also came with about 10 or 12 wings, which I felt was a generous portion. We also got the papaya pok pok salad which was crunchy and flavorful, and the Kai Yaang: a whole roasted game hen. It was moist and tender chicken with a crispy, subtly smoky skin. It was very tasty, but with a menu full of so many other unique items I recommend trying something more adventurous.   With 2 of us, we ordered 3 dishes and drinks - there was more than enough food and the total came to $40. I felt that was reasonable for the quality of food and atmosphere, and maybe we just got lucky with our menu selections but we had to struggle to finish all the food (which we did of course!) and I am no small eater.

Too bad du Midi is just not up to snuff at all.\\n\\nThe service was simply bizarre.  There was a food runner, bread/water server, waiter, and head waiter/maitre d'.  Yet, somehow, it took us 30 mins to get a bottle of sparkling water and A FULL HOUR to get one glass of wine.  This was after asking for them 3 times.  Now, mind you, at one hour, we still had not ordered food.  And the restaurant was only about half to three-quarters full.   To cut to the chase, dinner took 2 hours and 45 minutes, without coffee or dessert.  There was no way we could allow the meal to stretch to 3 and a half hours.  And this did not seem to be the result of a purposely pleasantly paced meal, but rather because the service was disorganized and amateurish.  Staff would disappear, claim to be coming right over, and otherwise attempt to not make eye contact.   That said, while they were engaged with our table, they were all polite and upbeat.  \\n\\nThe food was also not terribly good.  The bottom line:  Everything was cooked to perfection.  Technique was remarkable.  But the actual preparation and presentation was never more than the sum of its parts.  Everything was literal and boring.  And oddly, the food we were served often did not resemble what was on the menu.  In one case, aside from the protein choice, it was a totally different dish.\\n\\nThe olive and eggplant tapenade was sour and had not a single hint of eggplant.  Tasted like something you would get at TGIFs.  The green olive one was subtler and somewhat better.  Their bread and olive oil were very very good.\\n\\nWe ordered the prawns that were supposed to be served with coco bean, tomato and prosciutto.  Inexplicably, they instead were prepared with small white beans, basil pesto, and croutons.  At this point we were nearly 2 hours into the meal and the last thing I was going to do was send it back.  The prawns were cooked to perfection.  But, not only did I not order this preparation, it was also boring and seemed like an after thought.  \\"Just throw the prawns on top of some beans and uhmmmm how about a squirt of pesto, and well that might seem too mushy, put on some croutons.  They won't notice that it's NOT AT ALL WHAT IS ON THE MENU.\\"\\n\\nI ordered the sea bass.  Again, the actual fish was treated with all the care and love I could have hoped for.  But, it was supposed to be served with a sauce vierge.  Instead, it had a dry rub of herbs and salt that formed a dry, crumby, overpowering, and SALTY SALTY SALTY crust over the fish.  It stuck in your teeth and was unpleasantly crunchy.  There was nothing \\"sauce vierge\\" about it.   I scraped most of it off and was left with naked sea bass that I could have cooked myself.  The fennel accompaniment was really quite nice, but was way, way, way over-peppered.  Again with the scraping to make it more edible.   \\n\\nA somewhat more minor point, the rest rooms.  I would have expected that with the rehab, they would have been smart enough to put one upstairs.  Instead, you have to go downstairs and around the entire bar, wading through a tight, drunk crowd of faux-upscale 20-somethings in heat.  Yeah, elegant.\\n\\nPerhaps it was an off night or they were training staff.  Maybe I just ordered wrong.  But there is no excuse for not preparing what is on the menu and not really caring what is going on in the front of the house."},{"name":"Royal Punjab","address":"251 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I have lived in East Cambridge for a few years and this has always been my go-to for Indian food.

I am just going by the rating system and I have had better. Much better.  All I can say is this place is a bit of a disappointment. The other yelpers gave rave reviews, and I was ready for an outstanding Italian meal...  But there really is nothing special here.  It just seems as if a couple of obvious conventions were missed leading me to believe that I was attending amateur hour. They give you a lot of bread and refill it with out asking, but the Oil /balsamic vinegar is served in a somewhat deep container so it is hard to get to the vinegar that separates to the bottom.  So basically you just get olive oil.  For appetizers we had the minestrone soup and the insalata caprice.  The insalata caprice was just a couple of beefsteak tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and basil.  There was no balsamic and olive oil marinade here , which would of made the dish a lot better.  The minestrone that is 8.50 a bowl, is not worth 8.50 a bowl.  I really am unsure how such a price is justified.  It is good.  But not great.  The lasagna is like no other lasagna I have had before being that it was absent of ricotta.  If you broke it down it was just some baked mozzarella and pasta on a baking dish.  The one shining light was the lamb shank aka osso bucco.  They call it a lamb shank even though the menu is in Italian, but they still call the lamb shank.... Lamb shank.  Maybe Portland is not ready to call it what it is, but it is osso bucco, and it is fantastic.  If I went here and just had the osso bucco then I would of given a much better review.

I ordered the Khanom Jiin Naam Phrik here for lunch and was not impressed AT ALL.  Not impressed to the point that if someone from Pok Pok is reading this - PLEASE, for the sake of everyone involved, remove this from your menu.  I have had $5 food cart noodle dishes that not only taste WAY better than this, but that are about 50 times better prepared than this was.  If you can't properly prepare a rice noodle, you need to remove those dishes from the menu.  Period.  Additionally, it should be illegal to charge $15 for said monstrosity.  Actually, I will go one step further and say that even if this dish had been perfectly prepared, it does not warrant a $15 price tag.  Rice noodles, fibrous veggie stems and coconut curry sauce does not a $15 lunch make.  \\n\\nThis was my first time at this restaurant and I am kinda sickened when I remember this dish, and by extension, the restaurant.  And just in case you are mentally constructing a defense against these charges: I am a very adventurous and well-traveled eater.  I love fish sauce, shrimp paste, rice noodles etc. and use these products at home on a regular basis (though when I overcook my rice noodles into a gelatinous mush, I start over and DO NOT serve them to people and when I add shrimp paste to a meal, I don't market it as including prawns!).  \\n\\nMy experience:  I sat at the bar.  The bartender was my 'server' and the service was great even though he was very busy.  I did not order any well drinks, but there seemed to be a lot of interesting choices.  Maybe if I'd tossed back a couple, I would have felt better about being fleeced of $18.50 for a very small and not very appetizing LUNCH with tea (though, of course, that would have brought my total closer to $40).  The description of the meal was a bit deceptive on the menu, as it stated it was thin rice noodles with \\"a thick Southern Thai curry of coconut cream, prawns, and mung beans.\\"  It also said that it came with boiled egg.  The prawns, which were the selling point for me, were actually just shrimp paste added to the coconut cream.  Yeah.  Not a prawn to be seen (though it took me awhile to figure this out, as some of the congealed globs of rice noodles were similar in size and shape to prawns).  The 'boiled egg' (I think I mentally added an 'a' to the front of that when I read it) was actually a quarter of a boiled egg cut in half.  Yeah.  \\n\\nMy description of the composed dish would read like this:  Overcooked, gelatinous noodle globs drowning in a shrimpy coconut curry sauce with fibrous vegetable stems and pickled vegetable stems (these were kind of interesting).  Accompanied by a 1/4 of a boiled egg, a leaf's worth of shredded cabbage, and one sprig of cilantro.\\n\\nI saw a lot of yummy looking stuff at other tables - the wings seemed very popular, as well as some glass noodle dish that looked like the noodles were cooked properly.

And thankfully, Pok Pok was only a mile or so from where we were in East Portland, so we put our name down on a Saturday night, went to Imperial for some beers, and waited for that text message in 60-90 minutes that would let us know when we could try to spice ourselves to death.\\n\\nNow, call me an ignorant half-white person if you wish, but walking into Pok Pok felt like walking into a small backyard restaurant in Thailand. The ambiance, the music playing overhead, and the decorations all felt equally parts welcoming and Thai.

While some areas of Portland come with wishy washy service, this service was so friendly and personable, that you would have thought we were in Canada.\\n\\nAs far as the dishes went, everything here is served Thai family style and recommended to be shared. And trust me, this is the way to go. Cast aside your plate greed and get some dishes you can all agree on sharing. Oh, and start with the wings.

It's impossible.\\n\\nRegardless of what the wait is, put down your name and number, and go hit up a bar, kava or otherwise, while you wait. Trust me.

Our experience here was good, less than perfect, better than bad, and better than poor, for that matter.\\n\\nThe ambiance here is stellar. There's modern decor, great lighting, and most excellent Feng Shui. The workers all look pretty polished, as well. If you're looking for that lazy waitress look with hardly any makeup and her greasy hair in a bun, you won't find that here, friends. Expect soft curls, brows on fleek, and clean clothing, wrinkle-free, even. Other things to expect based on our initial experience: cocktails coming out after the appetizers (ugh), good-tasting cocktails, a dish you've already finished appearing again (ugh), long delays between dishes (ugh), someone else's dish arriving at your table (ugh), and a bill that you have to send back because they've charged you for the correct items and incorrect quantities, which, according to my calculations, gets them more money if you don't happen to notice (ugh). On a positive note, I feel that the sum of all of these negatives will not stop me from returning (lucky MF!). But, they've been open for some time now, and we all know this is not the first MF to exist in the ATL. You should have these kinks worked out by now, you MF'ers! See how I did that?\\n\\nThe quality of the fare is great, though. It's fresh, tasty, and beautifully presented. We had some miso soup, some edamame, the spicy tuna roll, a couple signature nigiri dishes, and this dreadful roll with plum paste and mint leaf. I'm quite confident that it tasted how it was supposed to, I just wanted to break out of our comfort zone just a bit.

The chicken was flavorful and crispy but not overpowering to where it clashed with the waffles. I tried a sweet potato fry from our friends and they were pretty yummy too. The maple vanilla cookie will make you want to slap yo mama. My mouth is watering at the thought. I would eat a dozen of those in one sitting.

Our taxi driver said \\"oh, that place\\" when we mentioned our destination. You see, Pok Pok is apparently very popular with long waits, but I figured we'd be safe so late. We arrived and only a few people were there waiting. With the zeal of two opponents in the abortion movement, the two hostesses debated whether we'd be waiting 1 or 1.5 hours, and subsequently directed us to the Matchbox Lounge across the street. \\n\\nWhen the FTC finishes with Microsoft, Google, AT&T, and Apple, they can come investigate these two places' business practices: Matchbox was packed with people - all waiting for Pok Pok. \\n\\nEventually, our table was ready. We ordered food and the waiter asked if my wife was OK with spicy food when she ordered the Papaya Pok Pok. I don't like to brag, but when we go out in Seattle to Thai places, I order 10 star heat when they have a 1-5 scale: I'm clearly OK with the heat; of course we said yes to spicy food. \\n\\nOh my god this was hot. We consumed only about 5 bites of the Pok Pok because it was just absurdly hot. Thanks for the underwhelming warning, Mr. Waiter. \\n\\nLuckily, I had ordered the fish sauce wings: damn, they were excellent.

But, once we walked in and were seated, nobody else came to talk to us for at least 20+ mins. The table next to us arrived after us, and had their drinks and their first appy before anyone even came over to our table for a drink order. Finally my husband got up and got someone to come by because he was really getting hangry! So we put in our food order, and she's about to leave when I'm said \\"we'd like to order some drinks as well\\" pfft!\\n\\nWhen the food arrived, it was delicious! We ordered the dips/spreads, the saganaki cheese, Greek salad, and the souvlaki combo plater. Again, everything was delicious. I've definitely had better Greek salads though. We were in Greece for 2 weeks this past summer and ate it everyday lol\\n\\nAnyways, back to the service... they rarely stopped by our table. My husband ordered a cocktail and was going to share the bottle of wine with me after his cocktail... the waitress originally brought a wine glass over for him but took it back saying \\"we're short on wine glasses\\". (That night was 50% off bottles of wine... if you're going to do that, maybe invest in more wine glasses!) When he was ready to have wine, he didn't have a glass and there was no one around to ask. So he goes to the bar and gets one himself. \\n\\nNext thing that led to the 2 star rating was the fact that they delivered our souvlaki platter to the wrong table. They delivered it to the table next to us and were completely clueless that they'd made a mistake. Luckily that table was confused and my husband said to them that it was probably our food and not theirs, so they passed the platter to us... staff was still clueless. \\n\\nAs we are ready to leave, it takes them a good while to bring over the payment machine (again we had to ask someone that was serving another table). We had some food to take with us and my husband asked if they had a bag to put it in because we were going somewhere else afterwards. Well she never brought it.\\n\\nAgain, the food is great at this restaurant, but the service is terrible. It seems they have all the waitresses serving all the tables.

My family visited the restaurant and the order was wrong, we complain and asked for the order to be corrected, The whole staff got involved with the complain, something I find very unprofessional.  Arguing in front of the clients was a true ambarassment for my family and I.  The order was from far offered to be fix instead everyone touched the food already bought and  the cheff came and put the missing food into the plate expecting for me to take the order after everyone has touched it.    I called the manager since he was not available at the time of my visit, he stated that for over 22 years of serving the clients there was 0 compliains and that he needed to talk to his staff about the incident.  Something is very hard to bellieve.  The way he responded with other comments made  me feel like if I was asking for charity and get free food.  I explained to him that my family and I are in 0 need to obtain charity since we are university graduates and work in the medical field, therefore we can definitely affort to pay for good food and good service and not for his crappy and unprofessional business.  \\nWorse experience in a Mexican Place and of course 0 recommendation to eat here."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I took my mom here while she was visiting and we absolutely LOVED the lemon poppyseed pancakes.

The only complaint I have is that they put the neon-green lime syrup on the plate.  I hate that stuff, and I don't think it has any place screwing with the already perfect taste of a good key lime pie.  Regardless, the pie was tasty.\\n\\nThe prices are very decent, considering the quality and portion of the food, and the great surroundings.  It looks like they have live music sometimes, as they have a small stage setup under the breezeway, and I think this would be a great place to relax and catch some good live music.\\n\\nOn a side note, there was a rooster running around the dining area.  Not sure if that thing was feral or if it is part of the restaurant, but it was interesting to say the least!  Either way, I would recommend anybody to try this restaurant.

It boggles my mind that someone could put in the work required to develop an entire chain of chicken wing restaurants, yet not manage to make decent chicken wings."},{"name":"Cairo Cuisine","address":"4800 Briarcliff Rd NE, Ste 1112","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Their food is as good as their service.\\nStaff is the best .\\nFood is very fresh and very tasty.\\nIt is always a pleasant experience to eat at this place."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has taken the meaning of incredible to a whole new level.\\nFirst, the restaurant has expanded to double the previous size but still retains a cozy feel.\\nSecond, the service and atmosphere is \\"over the top\\" amazing!

(If you're looking for air conditioning to escape the summer heat wave of 2015, that's another story. Only the chosen ones can enjoy the cool air conditioned room; all you other peons must humbly sit outside.) The wait wasn't terribly long at 3pm, so we only had to sip our coconut-infused iced water for 20 minutes before our table was ready.\\n\\nPok Pok's signature Thai and Vietnamese fusion makes for some interesting combinations on the menu, most notably Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings. If my taste buds were not already spoiled by San Tung's delicious dry fried wings in San Francisco, they would have been awestruck by Pok Pok's fish sauce wings. It commands a fairly steep price at $15 for six wings and lacks the crunchiness I like from my fried wings, but overall, the flavor was excellent. Definitely worth ordering a plate of these to share with a group of friends.\\n\\nHowever, the other dishes come in such small portions that you're bound to leave hungry if you don't order some rice. I personally prefer the coconut rice over the sticky rice; although the sticky rice comes wrapped up in an woven basket cube, it was still extremely hard by the time I got it. We also ordered the hoi thawt (mussel crepes) and the papaya pok pok (spicy green papaya salad), but neither dish was outstanding. If you're planning on ordering family style, chances are you'll need at least one more dish than the number of people in your party.\\n\\nOverall, I find Pok Pok to be overrated, but they do have the 2nd best chicken wings in the world."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We came here after church (Reality Boston) per the pastor's recommendation.

Before I get into the details, let me first admit that I didn't order any of the pho or pad Thai dishes. Now I'm aware that that majority of the readers are raising their eyebrows, and questioning whether to read any further. But when it comes down to it I cannot say no to a coconut curry dish. In my opinion, the glory of Thai food is attributed to the inverse combination of fiery curry paste and cooling coconut milk. \\n\\nI settled for yellow curry, the mildest when it comes to the Thai curries. The curry itself was very creamy and had the right balance of turmeric. The vegetables were also well presented and added color and texture to the dish. They were cooked perfectly, slightly tender with a crunch. The best part of the dish was the shrimp which was cooked well but more importantly, there were enough pieces to last the entire dish!\\n\\nI acknowledge that yellow curry is a somewhat \\"basic\\" Thai dish. The great thing about Pho Basil is its large and extensive menu with more unique and assorted curries (& noodles). For instance, my boyfriend got the beef cinnamon curry; although an unusual combination of flavors, it was delicious! \\n\\nThe sparking limeaid was also very refreshing and an obvious choice in the 80 degrees weather.

I might be responsible for some of the blame with very bad ordering choices - however C &S will have to share some of the blame. \\n\\nI will say that my server was very professional, the table set up was well done with white table clothes and good clean restaurant design.\\nOne star and three quarters\\n\\nI ordered a glass of Maker's Mark.  It was a fair enough drink but I was served a better drink for half the price at Taco Mac last week.  Recommendation: Improve your glassware and do a better job on the ice than the half melted ice that came with my drink.\\n\\nHere was my mistake - this is what I ordered Manhattan Clam Chowder and the Flounder with capers.   Strange, yeah I know.  I just was not feeling like Ahi Tuna or Sea Bass or Swordfish.   I felt like keeping it light.   \\n\\nThe Manhattan Clam Chowder was served in a strange bowl that resembled a gravy bowl with no pour spout.  Some genius in the back must have made the decision that I just love parsley because they dumped a heap of it on top of the clam chowder.  It completely interfered with the taste.   This is was the first clue that presentation does not  lead to perfect execution at C &S. \\n\\nManhattan clam chowder is served many different ways and I was envisioning an aromatic steaming bowl of chowder with a rich broth and pieces of clams.   NOT THEIR STYLE.  In fact it had the most unusual consistency for a soup and it almost reminded me a of a cooked,chunked and slightly congealed salsa and devoid of broth. I felt that the only three ingredients were tomatoes, onions and random bits of clam.  Any other vegetables were totally overshadowed.   Sounds strange but I just could not place how the recipe was devised. There was some clam included in the mixture but it was really light.    I would have to give this a complete F grade.  Not my style and I would be surprised if it was yours.      \\n\\nI prefer Manhattan Clam Chowder to New England style and I was really hoping for a great soup but was disappointed.\\n\\nI just read another review that said it was too salty.  I drank 3 full glasses of water after I ate the soup.    \\n\\nSo, I obviously whiffed with ordering the Flounder.  It was served over a bed of overcooked julienne carrots and snow peas.   They were overcooked to the point that I wondered if the thought I had really old brittle teeth.  I was also really disapointed to encounter several untrimmed snow peas.   Great snow pieces are served vibrant green but these were a depressed pea soup green.  I was served two uninspired dry potatoes....a depressing offering of vegetables. \\n\\nNow the flounder was served warm and COVERED in capers...every single inch and boy was it salty.  Let's not kill this situation.  It was not well prepared.  I have had great fresh flounder served to me and this was not it.\\n\\nI will say some positive stuff - the bread was fresh and I tried another person's Sea Bass in miso that was cooked properly but sort of drab.  I am searching for some better things to say here. \\n\\nToo many things missed on my soup and fish.  Originally, I thought I was to blame but in retrospect - it was mediocre.   \\n\\nI was the guest of another person and frankly, I ate most of my meal. I am a guy and I can eat just about anything and I would feel bad to stick someone for $50 and not eat what I ordered.\\n\\n I would be very cautious to return.   \\n\\nWhy?\\nIt was expensive - close to $50 for all of that.\\nNow that I think of it, I was not crazy about the bench seating that I had.  I felt like the dining companion I was with sitting across from me was looking down on me.  A strange set up. \\nThere are better seafood options closer to where I live. \\n\\nWhy ONE STAR?   It is too expensive a restaurant to miss this badly.  Really.  If I am complaining about an expensive cocktail and comparing you to Taco Mac....if I am the gm, then I would have some concern. \\n\\nAt the very least don't order what I ordered."},{"name":"La Fruta Feliz","address":"3124 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Based on the other reviews, I'd like to go back for lunch, but the breakfast is pretty good.

That said, La Fruta Feliz has excellent corn tortillas.\\n\\nWith migas, the other differentiator is the potatoes (excellent) and beans (average).\\n\\nOther things worth pointing out... the tacos had about 4 eggs in them (WAY out of proportion), and prepare to use your Spanglish... they speak almost zero English (which should never be a problem in a taqueria if you know what you like - if you don't know what you're ordering, prepare to eat a part of the animal you might not choose to otherwise)."},{"name":"Bollywood Cafe","address":"135 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Lexington","stars":"3.5","text":"I haven't been a fan of Indian food since I can't tolerate spicy food lately, but I thought I'd give this place another try after an unsatisfactory order years ago.

The reason that I wanted to make a reservation is that we had a party of 15 and wanted to get in and out as most of our party was traveling from out of town. When we arrived, the first thing they asked was do you have a reservation? This part was told to me second hand as I arrived approximately 10 minutes after my party. I informed the hostesses that I had called and was told that they only did walk ins.  The hostess then informed me that they do take reservations, but they had already taken as many as they could for that day. Well, great, but that would have been information that I should have gotten on the phone and not standing with a dozen plus people in your foyer.

The property is beautifully landscaped and nicely maintained. Pool area is huge (hotel is very family-friendly), restaurants were all very nice, concierge was helpful. Spent a day at Universal and took the hotel shuttle (that's included in the $25/day resort fee, but free Wi-Fi isn't?). Also used the hotel's town car service to the airport - $50 but much nicer than a cab.\\n\\nHowever...\\n1. Free Wi-Fi only in public areas, in-room is $14.95 daily. Really, Marriott?

However, there is nothing within walking distance (save for a gas station across the street from the hotel entrance) so they can charge whatever they want.

Whenever I try a new restaurant, especially one that's far from me, I always try to sample as much as possible to really get a good idea of food. I chose the calamari sampler to start off and it was amazing. The calamari was crisp and the meat itself was plump and juicy. The calamari meatball was different than a normal meatball. It had a seafood flavor and it was more tender than a normal meatball. The squid salad was so good, I'm sure the next time I go I'm gonna order 2 salads to start. It's made in a cerviche style and that allows for the meat to retain that great texture and freshness. It's such a simple dish but they do it so well. \\n\\nThe Sicilian Mussels were so good. That broth that it comes in could have been poured into a shoe and I'd still eat it. All the garlic and herbs really bring out the mussels flavor without overpowering them. At one point I was just drinking the broth out of the shells. Some people overlook simple things such as how seafood was prepared, but not me, I noticed that they took the time to make sure the mussels were cleaned properly. I like that.\\n\\nThis restaurant is best known for their squid ink pasta and I have to say, it did not disappoint. We chose the minced calamari with garlic and oil to really keep it simple and taste the pasta. That minced calamari and the garlic.... yum. It's amazingly savory. I ended up putting that on the bread, the clam chowder, and eventually just eating it by the spoonful. Serving it in the same pan it was cooked in it gives such a great atmosphere to your meal. But then again, the restaurant is small so you're right next to your food while they cook it. It's cozy and it brings people together while you eat. That's what good food does to you, it makes you happy.\\n\\nThe food was so good that I wanted more to try. I ordered the clam chowder and got the last bowl, IT WAS FATE!!! Good thing I ordered it because it was a great sample of what Boston Clam Chowder is all about. The creaminess of the soup and the texture of the clams and potatoes. Not even small potatoes, CHUNKS of potatoes. It wasn't salty and the balance of herbs and seasoning made that soup so enjoyable. That richness of the soup with the meatiness of the clams really made the meal, especially with the snow falling outside.

I've been here a handful of times, and have enjoyed every visit.  Even though it's located in a touristy area, I've never had to wait too long (if at all) for a table.  The d√©cor is super fun and playful...picture bright colors, hub cap lined ceilings, and other funkiness...there's even a giant Elvis statue waiting to greet you at the entrance.  Every time I come to Chuy's I get excited to order a margarita.  I've tried a few different ones, and they have all been delicious (Grandma's Rockin' Rita is probably my fav).  There's nothing surer to ruin your Mexican meal than a margarita that tastes like cheap mix with no alcohol.  The complimentary salsa is also quite good...it tastes fresh and has a nice kick to it.  For food, I think my favorite thing I've tried so far is the Elvis Presley Combo (Beef Tex-Mex enchilada, cheese Ranchero enchilada, chicken Tomatillo enchilada, a seasoned ground sirloin crispy taco & homemade tostada chips dipped in chile con queso).  It's so much food, that it's usually enough for me and Hubby to split.  For rice you can pick between Mexican rice or green chile rice, and for beans you can pick between refried or charro.  I like all of them, but the green chile rice and charro beans tend to be a little more on the spicy side.  And on a side note, they make all their tortillas and sauces from scratch every day.  Gotta love that!  Service is always spot on too.  Really my only complaint about this Chuy's is that it's far away from mi casa (which is in Debary).

Every bite was flavorful - and if anything, a little too much flavor. Nothing that coconut-infused water can't wash down though.\\n\\nIke's fish sauce wings are a must. Make sure to get it spicy! The spiciness is fairly mild, so folks who don't like spicy foods can still tolerate it. But the difference between spicy and non-spicy wings are night and day.\\n\\nThe Kai Yaang (whole roasted chicken) is perfect for 4 people. They recommend eating it with sticky rice, but I enjoyed eating the chicken even without the rice. The chicken comes with 2 sauces: sweet chili sauce and tamarind sauce. Mix 'em both together and get a super awesome mixture that's sweet, spicy, and sour!\\n\\nOn the other hand, Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar meat) definitely needs to be eaten with the sticky rice. The sticky rice really isn't meant to be eaten by itself and it IS a lot firmer, so that you can mold/flatten a chunk of it in your fingers. Then you can grab the meat with your flattened rice. Alternatively, I just put the meat on the sticky rice and rolled it up like a taco. The meat is actually fairly spicy (much more so than the wings) but it comes with a plate of iced lettuce to take the heat off your tongue if you need it. \\n\\nThe Khao Soi is a bowl of curry noodle soup and is a great filler. Order a bowl of coconut rice so that you can soak up every drop of the delicious curry.

I was pleasantly surprised that the salad was warm and it was also delicious and filling without being heavy. I grabbed a Jive Alive juice which was really tart. I could tell it was fresh because I could taste all the individual ingredients in it especially the lemon. I liked that they didn't add any ice to dilute it but it did make it a bit on the warm side so just a warning if you're expecting a nice cold drink.\\n\\nOverall a nice place to grab a hearty and delicious salad. The people behind the counter were really courteous and efficient given the long line of people they were serving. I grabbed my salad to go since there didn't seem to be a place to sit.

When I got there there wasn't any weight which was nice on a New Year's Eve afternoon. I was greeted by one of the friendly owners, I'm not sure which one. I ordered a vanilla latte which with a dollar tip came out to $5.50. That was a bit more than I expected to pay for a 12 oz latte but oh well, I was here to try something new so go with it. They had bourbon brown butter Rice Krispie Treat samples on the counter and I gave one to try. They were absolutely delicious! I don't think I would pay almost $4 for one but they were good none the less. I got my coffee and took about two minutes for it to be cool down enough to drink normally. I prefer my coffee still be a little hotter but no big deal. The taste was the same as a lot of superhit places I've tried in Portland. The roast definitely stood out which wasn't really my thing. I tend to like a smoother more mild drink. I can definitely see how this would rank a five-star on some people's taste list but this wasn't really my jam.

Our server was quick and cordial.  We had the wings both ways (mild and spicy).  Though both were good, don't bother with the mild because the spicy really aren't that spicy.  Boar collar was dynamite!  Had great flavor and intense heat!  Papaya salad - pretty good - not overly excited about it.  Note: there are two catfish curries.  One is ground where you can't even find the catfish and other has catfish medallions.  Order the one with the medallions.  Our server happily and quickly swapped curries for us once we realized that we ordered the wrong curry.\\n\\nGrilled prawns.  I thought they were tasty but a little spendy for just two prawns.

I personally think the pork belly at Biwa is much better.  We also had the Rainbow roll and Alaska roll.  The rainbow roll was much better than the Alaska roll. The salmon salad in the Alaska roll was very dry and there was too much Salmon eggs that made the roll too salty. After the first bite, I had to pick the Salmon eggs aside. I wasn't impressed with the price and the flavor of the sushi rolls. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute. Especially the tables where you take off your shoes and sit on a bean bag.

We are glad that we did. \\n\\nAmbience: Quite pleasant. There is an open kitchen area so one can watch the preparation and the tables have cloth coverings. All in all the seating area is comfortable and quiet, our group was able to converse easily through the night. I found myself comparing the experience favorable to Le PIgeon. Le Pigeon mind you is in all respects finer dining, but not as quiet. Yet, at Le Pigeon you will easily drop twice to three times the money.\\n\\nService: The wait staff are all students who do a rotation through the restaurant. As such there is a little hit and miss in their presentation, but they were all pleasant and eager to help. The errors were small, not being knowledgeable about all aspects of the food. (our waiter thought that the torte was milk chocolate, it was surprisingly dark- and good) That said our food was brought and served properly, ladies first and all was brought together. Our waiter did not notice that one salad was missing hazelnuts, but he did fix the problem quickly.\\n\\nFood: Four course prix fixe for $22 this hasn't happened in the real world for 25 years or more but at OCI it is the evening menu. There were two choices for the first three and three choices for desert. \\n\\nStarters: Leek and Celery Root Soup. Creamy and savory, but I had the Pork Rillette and the table agreed  that I made the right choice. It was served with an apricot jam, smokey honey and a dollop of mustard along with three toasted baguette slices. I felt that the night was truly off to a great start. The rillette was light, fresh and the accompaniments all blended like good music.\\n\\nSalads. Three of us had the Roasted Golden Beet and Endive Salad the other was a citrus and greens that looked good, but the goat cheese, endive, beet and hazelnut combination was better than we had expected and by now our expectations were rising.\\n\\nMain: Two had the hanger steak served at the chef's recommendation of medium rare and it was indeed perfectly cooked and tender in a way that made us very happy. One had the mussels and per him they were savory, sweet and delicious. I went for the Confit and I will have to say that it was as good as any I have had, anywhere and the accompanying lentils and squash just added.\\n\\nDesert. We again went 3 and 1. Creme Brulee was the popular choice and it came properly crisp on the top though I found it a little thicker/heavy than I like  the others found it to be spot on. The torte would have been more popular had the server not led us to believe it was a milk chocolate. There is a picture of it in one of the reviews. Just looking at that makes me want some!\\n\\nWine: The surprise of the night, yes I know I have used the word too many times already, but the wine . . . a 2015 Girardet Baco Noir from Oregon at $28 a bottle. Baco Noir is a strange grape you can look it up but the long and short is a very deceiving dark color for a wine that is hard to describe. Body wise it is like a Cru Beaujolais with a good acidity that complements the food well. I felt a little cherry present and that screamed perfection for duck, but it held up nicely to the steak as well. We had a second bottle . . .\\n\\nSo go, enjoy and with the money you save, go back you will thank yourself."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Simply the best sandwiches in Boston Massachusetts sam Lagrassas I recommended 100%... my favorite sandwich is the grill chapollet pastrami mmm delicious!!!!"},{"name":"Johnny B's","address":"1212 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Cute little diner, the wait staff was very nice, and the food came quick (it wasn't too bust but about 80-90% of the tables were filled) my husband liked his breakfast (egg, meat, hash browns) I had the chicken fried steak...rubber, bland, and no flavour! same with the biscuit and gravy.

I'm not opposed to returning in the future, but I surely wasn't quite as impressed as I'd been expecting. \\n\\nIt sounds like their blackened chicken with bow tie pasta is a must try, so I did. A solid four stars. The chicken was cooked well, but the pasta was a tad overdone and therefore a bit softer than I prefer. The pasta is cooked in a light Alfredo-type sauce. Meanwhile, atop the chicken is a teriyaki glaze, which surprisingly comes together well with the pasta sauce. The dish is also presented as a flower, which I would've surely taken a photo of back in my food photography phase. We also ordered their gator gumbo, which was a fairly big disappointment. It's got some good chunks of meat and a good assortment of okra and bell peppers, but the thickness and saltiness combined with just a tiny amount of rice made it somewhat difficult to finish. \\n\\nNow, onto the reasons for just three stars. First off, the young man at the register (bless his heart, as he was trying) just wasn't prepared to be on his own. He charged for two drinks when we only wanted one (I don't drink soda), told me they do accept American Express (only to be told otherwise by the manager following a few failed swipes), and wasn't very sure about either dish we inquired about. But mostly, the biggest issue was the wait. We waited a good 30-40 minutes from the time of our order to when we received our food. Fortunately, Wheel of Fortune was playing on tv to pass the time.

The atmosphere was dim and romantic, and very in-theme with Spanish music playing in the background all night.\\n\\nInstead of bread, we were served complimentary plantain chips with yogurt dip to start. The yogurt dip was light and delicate, and served as the perfect complement to the mild taste of the plantains.

The gizzards were tender and succulent. \\nSandwich de bistec (beef tenderloin, saut√©ed onions, crispy shallots, ketchup, $12): The beef was marinated and seasoned well. I thought this dish was a bit too similar to the chicken gizzards (both types of meat were served on the same crusty bread).\\nChoripan (chorizo and guava wrapped in puff pastry, $16): a stand-out and my favorite dish of the night. The chorizo was wonderfully savory and came wrapped in a sweet puff pastry and covered in a sweet fig sauce. The interplay of sweet and salty was excellent. \\nCarne mechada and gnocchi de yuca (Puerto Rican pot roast and yucca gnocchi saut√©ed in a sage & brown butter sauce, $18): The meat was tender and melt-in-your-mouth, while the gnocchi was soft and chewy. A great combination.\\nAtun salteado con ajonjoli (sesame seared sushi-grade tuna served over sweet plantain and wasabi aioli, $16): By this time I was almost too full to eat this. The tuna is very salty and crusted with seeds, but serves as a good complement to the sweet plantain base.\\n\\nThe service was well-timed, with roughly one tapas coming out every 20 minutes. Our waiter was very attentive, and was constantly topping off our water and asking if we were enjoying the meal. \\n\\nFor dessert, we had the tres leches (three milk cake (condensed, evaporated, cream) with Taza Chocolate ganache, soft merengue + cinnamon, $12). I highly recommend this dessert. The cake was spongy and moist, and the meringue on top was light and airy. \\n\\nThe total came to $105 (before tax and tip), which is not bad given the amount of food that we ate (we were both completely stuffed by the end).

I walk by it no matter what, at least four times a day and this essentially makes it one of my go-to spots for lunch, especially since it's so customizable and healthy. \\n\\nThe line unfortunately can get very long but those brave enough to sit through it will be rewarded with a very friendly staff making you a custom, delicious salad. They do have pre-designed, signature salads you can pick from like their populate Kale Caesar salad (~ ($8.50) or their District Cobb (~ $11.50) which all you can really customize is the amount of salad dressing you can add to it (light, medium or heavy) but you can also design your own from scratch as well.\\n\\nThey do use some great ingredients and so far the various salads I've had there, about four different ones have been terrific; filling, tasty and fresh. They do have a limited option of drinks and they also have soups.\\n\\nSome of their salads feature grains (quinoa & farro) while others include soba noodles. One of them even has Sriracha in the dressing! The possibilities are numerous and despite a slightly hefty pricetag, eating there so far has been rewarding; My 2:30PM feeling (IE: crash!) hasn't been as bad as usual.\\n\\nAnd if you can't wait in line you can always order online and pick it up 30 minutes later. That will help you avoid having to wait upwards of 20 minutes, in line, if not longer. \\n\\nOverall Sweetgreen is a solid addition to the area and I'm a big fan of their Kale Caesar which I've ordered many times already. This is one of my go-to lunch spots since I work so close to it and while the lines are often long, I should really start ordering online more. I just wish that their website wasn't as limited as it is. My only complaint about this spot are the prices which are a tad too high for salads, preventing me from going daily and the fact that it does take a while to get through the process if you go in person. I'll try ordering online though - stay tuned for an update."},{"name":"Mad Mex - Columbus","address":"South Campus Gateway, 1542 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Half off most food after 10pm ?!

They take their time to clear the tables, which I appreciated, but when we were seated, it was another 15 min before we were even served water. In fact, we had to ask for our waiter. Again, totally fine. We ordered food, and I asked our waiter about their  oyster sliders. I was told they were sufficient as entrees even though they were listed on the appetizers. Dont get me wrong they were amazing, but they were the size of fingerfoods. I didnt want to order more because they took about 30 min to come out with our food. They were only $5, so I should've known they wouldn't be full-sized entrees. \\n\\nFood on the other hand, was very good. We had:\\n-Dozen Oysters, very good, though I felt our waiter was less knowledgable about oysters and I was (and this is an oyster place)\\n-Fish & Chips, beer battered fish, not too oily, on top of a heap of cajun seasoned fries. the aioli had a nice kick\\n-Lobster Roll, good amount of lobster on buttered brioche served with homemade chips\\n-Fried Fish sandwich, the most flavorful of the dishes\\n\\nThe ambience and layout was great, just like their sister restaurant ESK.

I will be living in Atlanta next Fall and am absolutely obsessed with my beautiful city. The Nook helped to brighten my ATL experience on my 18th birthday! \\n\\nI like the idea of a hole-in-the-wall restaurant (please don't give that term a negative connotation; I mean it in a positive way!). You can rest assured that the food will always be authentic and the atmosphere welcoming. The Nook is a a perfect example of such a place - the ambiance is warm with just enough of a fiery side to excite you, and the food is rich in taste and Atlanta culture! \\n\\nThere is something good to be said about a place that has created its own unique dish - Totchos! I HIGHLY recommend them! The word comes from a combination of \\"nachos\\" and \\"tots\\"; they're basically an epic pile of tater tots complete with delectable toppings. There are several different varieties; I recommend the Black and Blue! You can also order a snack size if you are less hungry (the normal portion is a liberal amount, but if you're hungry it is worth it). The Nook also has famous burgers!\\n\\nThe decor of the establishment is hip yet classic, like the perfect little tavern in your imagination. There is a full bar in addition to the advertised \\"drink for the trees\\", a cute little alcoholic lemonade that my parents got (They let me have some and it was delicious! Some of the proceeds are donated to Piedmont Park conservation!)\\n\\nThe staff is just as hip as the decor! Our server, Edward, talked with us about an Imagine Dragons concert and Music Midtown! I am obsessed with the culture up in this place! He was a little flustered because the place was relatively busy that night and it took a little long for us to receive everything we ordered, but on a larger scale, the service was polite and entertaining! \\n\\nThe only downside to The Nook that I noticed is the minimal parking. They offer valet into a cramped back lot, but otherwise you will have to park on the street nearby - not a huge deal if you're used to this in Atlanta! \\n\\nOverall, The Nook was warm and inviting with exceptional food and an educated wealth of Atlanta culture! I highly recommend it for a more laid-back, happy-feeling evening to binge on some Totchos, or as a place to bring your closest friends for a relaxing drink in  a welcoming environment that won't make you feel like a gross barfly at all. \\n\\nI will definitely be going back to The Nook (especially for more Totchos!)"},{"name":"OPA Grill & Tavern","address":"18 S Sandusky St","city":"Delaware","stars":"4","text":"Being a Chicagoan, I was hoping this was legit Greek food, but not even close.

The second negative is the music--it is Asian music, played VERY loudly.  It is an Asian restaurant so perhaps we should have expected the atonal music--but it was loud and unpleasant to our ears and relentless.

After all, it was those same awesome reviews that made my decision to try Piazza Italia a reality.  So now I write my review, with the hope that, if you decide to go here, you will understand my lower rating.\\n\\nThe food was OK.  Not excellent.  Not bad.  OK.  The menu is pretty much all pasta.  My wife had the Pesto Penne and I had the Linguine Carbonara, although it is described as something different but is considered \\"Gino's Favorite.\\"  The flavors were good, not to heavy, not to light.  However, it was pasta.  And not even house-made pasta.  There is not a lot that can go wrong when serving pasta.  The service however, was spotty at best.  We had a reservation for an outdoor table.  We arrived a few minutes early, and when our table was ready, the server pointed down the sidewalk and said, \\"there is your table.\\"  We sat ourselves and then waited for menus.  After several minutes, they arrived, and the specials were expressed.  However we received no wine menu.  I had to ask for that.  A good 15 minutes went by before we were able to place our order for both wine and food.  Fortunately we had a nice basket of bread and some oil and vinegar.  However, the oil and vinegar was served in a deep ramekin, which made it impossible to get to the vinegar without soaking the bread in oil.  And there was no salt on the table to compliment the oil and bread.  Basically, the server seemed a bit hurried, even though there appeared to be no reason for it and it was not like she was spending any time at our table.  She did not listen well, giving me the listing of white wine by the glass when I asked for reds.  She was nice, but needs to slow down a bit, listen without interruption and just give a bit of attention to her customers.  That is what we pay money for, since all we had to eat was \\"pasta.\\"  \\n\\nBottom line - the food was decent.  The service, so-so.  The atmosphere - street side eating.  The prices - a bit high for non house-made pasta.  My wife and I love to experience different restaurants around Portland, but sometimes we wished we had just gone to Cafe Mingo's.  We never are disappointed there.  If you want so-so pasta, you might enjoy Pastini, since they serve pretty much the same menu.

The bartender who served us was great and talked us through the menu and the cocktail and wine lists.  You could tell he had passion for the place.   Everything about Burdock & Co tells you it's well thought out -  the cloth napkins and vintage silver cutlery, the dishes, the beautifully printed menus,  even the music.  You just know that there's pride and talent.\\n\\nAnd then there's the food.  We shared the roasted squash and barley miso Ramen,  with spinach and smoked chili oil - a smooth, rich, almost creamy broth with perfectly cooked noodle and in addition to the spinach, some spicy arugula - just enough kick and crunch to make it brilliant.   All I can say is WOW.  Then came the fried chicken - small pieces of chicken coated in panko and perfectly fried, served with pickled vegetables - and two sauces - a garlicky romesco and a homemade mayonnaise.  Another winner.\\nLastly, we shared a sunchoke terrine - crispy outside and deliciously earthy tasting on the inside.  Amazing.\\nAlthough we weren't drinking  - my partner had a cocktail that he said was one of the best he's ever had - we did look at the wine list which is wonderfully thought out with only sustainable wines - so mostly old world wines -  but some very affordable choices, at least for Vancouver.  We contemplated dessert but couldn't manage it - then to our delight - we got 2 delicious macarons with our cheque - I  can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Authentic izakaya fare by a restaurant chain from Japan.

No, not as tasty as some of the oilier barbacoas in this world, but a satisfying lump of meat with queso fresco nonetheless.\\n\\nThe Baja shrimp taco stacks up with the best in town with more of a Mexican flare courtesy the added escabiche, which was definitely an eye opener.\\n\\nThe Crossroads: their brisket taco. Alright. A bit dry and crumbly but pretty good flavor.\\n\\nPerhaps, the most noteworthy: The Dirty Sanchez. Damn them for coming up with that name. There is no end to the jokes and I don't feel like going there. But it's a great and innovative breakfast-lunch taco hybrid. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, it's the bold flavors on many of the tacos, if not all, that seem to have sucked me in.\\n\\nWatch out! This place has been packed of late. There is nary a good time to go for lunch. Threading the needle between the 11am, noon and 1pm lunchers is next to impossible.

After reading the reviews here, I opted out of the meat and got a pizza with feta and artichoke hearts. I sat down at a table which had been bussed but still had water rings from glasses on it, and the table next to me had the same plus chunks of pizza on it. It was only an hour after opening and I was the only person in the store. Why not wipe down the tables? I waited for a long 45 minutes for a very small pizza. The girl said \\"did you have the feta and artichoke pizza?\\" And I couldn't help thinking \\"Is there anyone else here?\\" I agree with others here that the crust is like soggy crackers. The toppings and cheese were good and I enjoyed the pizza for the most part. It did upset my stomach a little (probably because it was so greasy) and I could never justify $15 for a \\"small\\" pizza (I had hoped to share with my husband) which was really just an individual pizza. But ants?! I almost threw the pizza away...good thing I was hungry."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Holy crap this place is amazing! I thoroughly enjoyed the Thai restaurant scene back in Silicon Valley and thus far enjoyed the restaurants here in Portland. Pokpok blew off the roof! Tasty with unbelievable flavors. Spicy, but not blow off the roof of the house hot. I now have a new favorite Thai restaurant!"},{"name":"Pepper Lunch","address":"5951 No 3 Road, Unit 150","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"We went twice as the first time we went was crazy hectic and grand opening so we thought we'd give them the benefit of the doubt..\\n\\n\\n\\nFIRST VISIT:\\n\\nSeen a line outside the door and people were crammed like sardines in a can. Everyone was confused but thank gawd the girls in front of us told us pass everyone in the line and get our names written down.\\n\\nSo after 35 min wait, we were called and placed our order and paid first.. I guess no Dine and Dash??\\n\\nOrdered beef pepper rice $8.95 and $1.50 extra for egg and $1.50 for mashed potatoes. My bf ordered extra beef pepper rice with additional egg and purchased the combo which was $2.00 extra that comes with bland miso soup and soda with 1 refill ONLY. DO NOT order the mashed potatoes.. Waste of $1.50. Was fun experience cause was new style but after we left, we were still hungry!!!\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND VISIT:\\n\\nBF was craving fried rice and it was almost week and half since grand opening so we thought lets go for lunch.\\n\\nThis time I got Pepper beef hamburger steak and he got extra beef pepper rice. Ordered extra egg $1.50 x 2 and he got a drink $2. Noticed after 1.5 weeks the combo price has increased to $2.75. So we skipped it. Basically came out to $29 including tip. Once again cool concept but we've decided that for the amount we paid, we could of gotten our own ingredients and made crazy ass fried rice for cheaper. \\n\\n\\n\\nService is 3/5\\nFood 3.5/5\\nCleanliness 3.5/5\\nParking 1/5 WARZONE!!! \\n\\n\\nWe ended up hungrier than ever so we went to beard papas and got some cream puffs.. If we're in area we might stop by but other than that for the price, amount and quality, rather go elsewhere in Richmond as there so many cheaper eating establishments!"},{"name":"Thunderbird Coffee","address":"2200 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I often go to work another way, prefering other eastside coffeeshops to this funny place. . . although I was hankering for mi madre's breakfast tacos and I hit clem's up for a coffee if I gotta.

Maybe not though, because it was much, much smaller than I anticipated.\\n\\nGot seated right away, and then the waiter disappeared for a little while.  Hrm.  Once he came back though, the service was great.  Hubby and I each got a glass of cabernet sauvignon (we were looking for a quick eat before the VP Debate, hence the lack of bottle purchasing).  He got the grilled buffalo chicken salad, which was basically bacon wrapped chicken skewars and salad, and I got a side of the mac and cheese.  We both moaned in delight as we noshed.\\n\\nIt's so cozy in here, I really dig the atmosphere.  Would totally come back and chill out by the spot where there should be a low fireplace but instead just has some candles.  \\n\\nThey were playing some kickass Indian music.
