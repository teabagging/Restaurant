Cha-ching!\\", but eventually you realize the massive size is these burgers' Achilles heel.  Cooking something that thick sucks all of the moisture and flavor right out of it.  Yeah, Thurman's offers all kinds of tasty-sounding toppings, but true burger lovers don't eat for the toppings-- we're in in for the beef, baby.  \\n\\nI will give the Thurman Cafe some points for excellent historic dive-bar ambiance (the menu printed in Comic Sans made it even better), and some more points for the pretzel bites, which were delicious.

We were first in line and waiting about 20 minutes.. not too long but when you're in the cold it feels double that time. The food was subpar.. there was nothing GREAT that made me go YUMMM after trying it.. maybe because im from LA where there is Asian food in every corner but it just wasn't worth the price. The wait till the food came to the table was another 20 minutes.. do not come here if u had a long hike, long day and haven't ate all day.. that was our first mistake. We hadn't ate all day and it was 3:00 didn't fully get our food till about 3:45. So last thing, I used my card to pay for my table... I have the chase app so I'm notified once I'm charged. I was charged TWICE. The first time for $60 the second for $55. The waitress wasn't going to tell me (it seemed) until I mentioned that I noticed. She said \\"oh yeah.. I accidentally charged  you for an order that wasn't yours.. so I canceled it and then charged the right one.\\" First of all, who said I even had enough account balance to cover a double pay, of a big meal? Everyone knows it takes days to get a refund back. Here I am, on a trip, on a budget.. and was charged twice. The appropriate thing to do would be to come back and let me know you ran the wrong charge, and allow permission for me to let you run my card again. What if that second charge made me go negative? I could have have paid in cash the second charge... or even split it with my friend so that I wasn't minus over $100.. I won't be seeing that $60 refund until I'm back home in LA. Very disappointed.

The piece of fish is rather large and good, but the amount of tartar sauce was minimal (not a fan of having to ask for more after just a few bites) and they included some cocktail sauce for some unknown reason. My chips were good, and my wife seemed to enjoy her food as well.\\n\\nOverall, Cork and Fork was a fine little restaurant.

I am not much of a buffet person but I could appreciate all the piles of naan, tandoori chicken, pakora,  and the vats of saag paneer for a reasonable price. \\n\\nMy family and I have tended to prefer dinner though and always appreciated the warm but not annoying service and the frankly funky atmosphere. \\n\\nNow that the Kmart center has been flattened to build more  (do we really need them?) apartments, Abhirruchi has found a new home down the road at Millikan and Murray next to Sushi Hana and Cafe Yumm. The little parking lot can be somewhat of a disaster during busy times, be warned. \\n\\nWe got take out on a not so busy Saturday night. I appreciate that \\" a la carte\\" includes naan and rice. So many places are charging for that separately now and the rice being extra bugs me. We ordered mutter paneer ( peas and yummy cubes of Indian cheese) and butter chicken which has a different name on the menu now...not makhani but something close. Two entrees were under $30 and fed three of us. \\n\\nThe bread was perfect. The rice was fine. The mutter paneer had less peas but more cheese (my cheese focused teen was happy). The spice level was perfect. The only complaint we have is that the chicken in the butter chicken was dry, which was not great. Like it was cooked separately, then added?? But the sauce was fab as usual. Pro tip: dunk your naan in the sauce. Eat less carbs tomorrow. \\n\\nWe are still fans of Abhiruchi.

That's something I've never seen before. The menu is near the turnstile and it's hard to see once you've gone through the turnstile. The atmosphere was a little uninviting because the workers seemed like they wanted you to get out of the store. We ordered the special of the week which is Italian sausage with peppers and onions. We waited for around 5 minutes for the sandwich to be toasted which felt unusually long but it went by fast since you can look around the store at all of the Italian goods. We paid for our sandwich just around the corner from where we ordered. Near the cashier, they have fresh pasta which looks really good. \\n\\nThe sandwich was warm and it was cold outside so I was excited to eat it. When we opened it, we saw cheese all over the sausage slices...the menu didn't have cheese on it. If it's mozzarella, I'd be fine with it because it's the cheese I like, however, it was provolone. It's a pungent cheese and I'm not a fan of the smell but my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the smell nor the taste.

The glassware is crystal. The drinks are innovative.

Himitsu will be one of my go to spots in Atlanta from now on, despite the heavy price tag. \\n\\nThere were a couple disappointments that occurred during the visit. I view mixology as an art form, however the art here was not to my taste. As a matter of fact, others at the table did not enjoy their cocktails either. I realize that it's a matter of opinion and perhaps taste, but it did seem that it wasn't just myself that found some of the drinks lackluster and others horrific. Even the ones that I did think were decent, it wasn't anything to be blown away by in taste or presentation.\\n\\nThe other disappointment were certain service elements. The waitress was very nice, but not attentive whatsoever. She couldn't notice that we are sitting without drinks for extended periods of time. I had to repeatedly turn around and look for her. It was a little annoying, especially given that this is a very small establishment. On a positive note, food did come out very quickly and was spectacular.\\n\\nHimitsu wouldn't last long in a city like New York or Chicago, but it's a step in the right direction for Atlanta.

It's Neapolitan style, And it's better and tastier than New York style. \\n\\nYes, this Antico location is busier than the one in west midtown but the quality of the pizza is the same - still very good. My boyfriend and I have been here twice before Braves games so yes this place is extremely busy and has a line out the door, but they make the pizza extremely fast. Our favorite pie is lasagna but if you're not a meat on pizza person Margarita and the White pizza looks great too. For 20ish bucks for 2 people with one pizza at the ballpark is not a bad price.

The problem is they don't care about the quality of the ingredients or the cleanliness of the oven. If you order any bagels with seeds (sesame, poppy, sunflower, etc) the seeds taste like mold and/or dirt.  This is not a one time issue, this has been the case for years and at each of their locations.  They are either buying surplus ingredients or storing them in a damp and unsafe environment.  You can steer clear of the seeded bagels and go for something else but then you still have a bagel that is coated in burnt cornmeal.  This shows that they are too lazy to scrap the ovens.  As long as the lines are out the door and there are no other bagel shops in the area they have no reason to change."},{"name":"Chrome Yellow Trading","address":"501 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My favorite coffee shop I visited while traveling for a week throughout Georgia and South Carolina. Highly, highly recommend!\\n\\nWithout skipping a beat... They have free, non time permitted parking in both the private lot form and a one way street block. So many options!

Thank you Chrome Yellow Trading for being one of the few cafe's that doesn't contribute to my road road and parking anxieties.\\n\\nMoving on.. They have Oat Milk! Can you hear it in my words? I'm stoked on this place, guys. I had an iced oat milk latte while plugging in my laptop and sitting at the bar, feet dangling with joy knowing and the free thought I will not be getting a ticket while enjoying my time here. Pure ecstasy, really. My latte was fantastic and gave me the most long lasting, casual yet effect caffeine buzz. It also paired oh so wonderfully with my Gluten Free banana muffin that was warmed and crisped to perfection.\\n\\nCYT has their own local Atlanta roasts, as well as Stumptown and Methodical for sale in bags at the counter. As wonderful as Stumptown is I would recommend shopping local at this one with the Chrome Yellow Trading roasts. Take a stroll around the cafe before plugging in or sitting down for breakfast. They have tons of cute merch including very hipster home decor and office options. Their stickers and mugs are very well branded and a little out of my price range but you got to treat yourself sometimes. \\n\\nI'd 100% recommend visiting this spot for a coffee with friends, plugging into work, meeting colleagues, writing to your long lost lover over seas, and rediscovering your passions in life.

The noodles have a great texture about them as well; chewy but still satisfyingly slurpable. And the meat, oh the glorious mound of meat below the surface. They put a considerable amount of meat into this bowl so be prepared for that meaty brisket and the thinly sliced rare top round. I personally dip my meat into a mixture of hoisin and chili oil on the side and leave the broth as is with no additions. I know tripe isn't everyone's favorite thing in the world,  but it does provide some great texture. Add that squeeze of lime, basil, and bean sprouts and you have something magical before you. I go here during off hours so I can really savor it and not feel pressured to free up my table for the few dozen waiting outside. But hey, the line is there for a reason!"},{"name":"Greenhills Traditional Irish Bakery","address":"780 Adams St","city":"Dorchester Center","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend & I live in Dorchester, we come here ALL the time, our parents came to this same place as kids.. we absolutely love everything they have to offer.

I am more of the lettuce wrap person than the flour wrap, but I came by for a family dinner. \\n\\nThe place is super cramped, and our table barely fit all 7 of us. To give you an idea of how small the place is, the chair I was sitting on and the chair behind me basically cut off the tiny walkway to get through the place. \\n\\nThe reason why my uncle wanted us to try this place is because they make their peking duck with the meat still on, and for him it seems healthier. With the flour wrap, it tasted okay, but I only ate one flour wrap because I wasn't into it. We were also served the skin part of the duck to dip in sugar, and that was so bad, it was like I was drinking oil with little bits of sugar. So oily and I did not like it at all.\\n They also fry the duck bones, which was so good! My only complaint was some parts were too crispy it was sharp. Maybe fry a bit less, but it tasted amazing! The last dish with the peking duck was the duck soup, it tasted bland to me, didn't taste fresh. If they served it fresh it probably would've tasted a lot better.\\n\\nWe ordered a lot of side dishes and honestly I can't remember any of their names. But my favourite ones were the spicy stir fried napa cabbage and pig skin jello like cubes (idk my mom said something along the lines of pig skin but there is a picture so see for yourself). The zhajiang mien was really good, the noodles tasted like the ones you get at Chef Hung's and the sauce was nice and not too salty. The fried pork balls were meh, you'd think they'd be sweet & sour because of the smell, but it is just a dull flavour. \\n\\nService was pretty inattentive, we never got a tea refill, and we asked them about 3 times to refill but they kept forgetting until they came by with a pot right when we finished our meal. \\n\\nI probably will come back here if my family wanted to, and try some new dishes.

I can't imagine eating the entire lobster roll with the fries as they give a lot of fries, but the salad was the perfect side to the rich lobster roll. They do not skimp on the lobster meat.

The dish was extremely oily, the pieces of duck we were given barely had any meat so they were practically just duck bones, and the roast pork had basically no skin. The amount of meat given compared to the rice portion is so off.

This restaurant previously existed in Stone Mountain roughly 10 years ago and has reemerged. It has the look and feel of a chain, but at the time of writing this review, this is the restaurant's only location. You can think of it like Zaxby's with a Japanese twist. The business name is presumably derived from the panko breadcrumbs used to coat the chicken. The chicken is quite delicious.\\n\\nA wings joint (Gemi Wings) used to exist in this spot, but Ponko has come in and spruced the place up, adding plenty of fenced-in patio seating, with umbrellas and heat lamps, as well as a dining room (during our visit, the dining room was still under construction). From the outside in, the renovations look nice. The brand has a fun and playful theme. The interior is simple, clean, bright, and modern. The kitchen is semi-open. Orders are placed upfront. Water, condiments, disposable cutlery, napkins, etc. are self-serve. They also have a USB hub which can charge multiple phones/devices.\\n\\nThe menu is straightforward with $10 plates (includes 2 sides), salads, and sandwiches (includes 1 side) and $7 sandwiches (no side), rice boxes, and salad boxes. A difference between the plates and boxes is the chicken tenders are served whole on the plates as opposed to chopped for the boxes. You can also order the tenders by themselves in 2, 4, 12, and 20-piece sets. The tenders work out to $1.50 a piece no matter how many you buy. All of Ponko's chicken is boneless and they come in 3 flavors: original, spicy, and BBQ.\\n\\nAlong with fried chicken tenders, Ponko serves veggie patties, tofu, and grilled chicken cutlets. The sides are fairly basic and include white and brown rice, Ponko and \\"sweet\\" fries, coleslaw, Hawaiian-style potato salad, a garden salad, and seasonal specials. The seasonal side during our visit was \\"South Central\\" fries. These were the house Ponko fries, which are seasoned with roasted seaweed and toasted sesame seeds, with a seasoning made of Flamin' Hot Cheetos added.\\n\\nFor dessert, they offer cookies, \\"CakeCups\\" (individually portioned layer cakes inside clear plastic cups with snap-shut lids), and mochi (Japanese rice cake) ice cream. Beverage-wise, in addition to the usual fountain drinks, they've got coffee, tea, green tea lemonade, beer, and wine.\\n\\nI tried all 3 sauce flavors. The original was excellent, the spicy was very good, and the BBQ was average. One thing I like about Ponko's chicken tenders is they seem to have the perfect balance of meat and breading. The tenders aren't so thick that you're overwhelmed with just meat. Instead, you get lots of crispy, nicely seasoned breading in every bite and each tender stays appetizing and moist throughout. The original and spicy tenders are actually some of the best-tasting tenders I've had. The original flavor has an addictive, sweet, and honey-like taste to it. The spicy flavor has a noticeable kick, but nothing extreme; enough to have you coming back for more. The BBQ flavor, expectedly smoky and vinegary, is par for the course. To me, it tastes like most other run-of-the-mill BBQ sauces out there.\\n\\nIf you order the sandwich, the chicken is placed inside a standard, soft, white, hamburger bun with slaw. Whether you order a plate or a sandwich, your meal comes with small sides of Asian-style pickles (which I believe are prepared with sweet seasoned rice vinegar) and buttermilk ranch dressing.\\n\\nWhile the chicken is yummy, the sides leave something to be desired. I tried the Ponko fries, South Central fries, slaw, and potato salad. The fries were good, but they could have been better. They were hot and fresh, but were seasoned inconsistently between plates. I really enjoyed the seasoning mix, but it had a hard time sticking to the fries. What often resulted were relatively plain-tasting fries with a pile of seasoning leftover at the bottom of the tray. As for the South Central fries specifically, I couldn't taste any of the Flamin' Hot Cheetos powder.\\n\\nThe slaw is an Asian-style slaw made with coarsely shredded green and red cabbage and carrots. The potato salad is a mayonnaise-based, Hawaiian-style potato salad. While OK, both were mostly unmemorable/unremarkable.\\n\\nService was great. The staff was nice and our orders came out pretty quick.\\n\\nThere were 4 of us and one of the employees tried to sell us on the 4-person group meal for $40.

The turkey tips had some really awful sauce on it which I guess did hide the dryness of the turkey a little if you can stomach the awful sauce. I will say that the sides were actually very good...red bliss mashed potatoes and brocolli on the steak plate and rice and butternut squash on the turkey plate.

Last time, they served it with lobster (they were going to serve it with salmon but I asked to sub lobster instead), calamari, and shrimp with a marinara sauce. I felt there was zero depth to it. THIS time around, I got it with mussels, calamari, shrimp, and the fra diavolo sauce. What a difference the mussels and fra diavolo sauce makes. I couldn't get enough of spice so I asked for crushed red peppers on the side for extra FIRE. \\n\\n4) Costata di Vitello alla Griglia con Salsa al Vino Rosso: essentially a grilled veal chop---a hearty, thick cut of veal served in an veal jus sauce and veggies.

It's only $10 before tax.\\n\\nMy friend got the baked sandwich with eggplant parmesan, which takes longer to make because they bake it in the oven, but it comes out crispy and steaming. The cheese was melted, and the bread was crunchier. When I come back, I'm definitely getting the chicken cutlet parm on a baked sandwich!"},{"name":"Kkoki Korean BBQ","address":"10325 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I visited for a friends birthday.

We ended up having more people join than originally planned, but they kindly added a table so we all would fit. They did check several times to see if we were ready. When we got there and throughout our time there as people in our group kept showing up. The food was all fine, but just not something I personally enjoy.

Made the trek out here from Cambridge with my boyfriend to try the rolls, but they were all surprisingly very bland and lackluster. The bread used was phenomenal and buttery. The shrimp roll was pleasantly good and was probably my and my boyfriend's favorite out of the three. The crab roll was the worst: when the crab meat was eaten by itself, it was tasteless. Same goes for the lobster.\\n\\nAs my boyfriend puts it, this place is fast casual, and they do it well. For a light lunch, the shrimp roll combo is probably the way to go ($9 + $3 for chips, soda, and a pickle). This place is priced well for what it is (except for the cookies), which bumps it from the 2 stars I wanted to give. I'd gladly pay $4-6 more for fresher, tastier lobster, crab, and shrimp. If only this place served the same lobster as Alive and Kicking Lobster, or if Alive and Kicking Lobster served their lobster in the same rolls as here.

I like restaurants that have the order at the counter and take a number concept; makes things easier and that's the way it works here at Pine State Biscuits.  The food came out very fast and I immediately noticed that it looked scrumptious and portions were large. Of the things we ordered, my favorite was the Reggie Deluxe with egg--the biscuit was perfect, not greasy or too heavy, and they gave a nice ratio of gravy so that one could pick up the sandwich and actually have clean hands.  The chicken was also excellent.  I did try the BBQ biscuit and it did not taste as good, the \\"BBQ-ness\\" wasn't strong and there didn't appear to be any sauce on it.  Instead, there was a sauce for dipping. As a side order (as if one really needs to order a side order here!), Cajun Fries were cheap and awesome with just enough spicy bite to keep you binging on them.  \\n\\nWhen I went, there were no crowds and it was comfortable enjoying the open-air restaurant.

The first sandwich I ordered must've been leftover from the lunch rush because the biscuit was dry and mouth-dessicating.  The second sandwich was much-improved.

This place is not the best for groups and if you have children, you may find it difficult for them to openly explore without getting into another person's personal space. Aside from that, I would highly consider giving this a try. Afterwards, stop by the movie theater or shop around. The plaza that this fresh kitchen is in is AMAZING and has so many things to do."},{"name":"Happy Lamb Hot Pot","address":"4755 Kingsway, Ste 200","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"I give this place a thumbs up and a thank you for their patience and great customer service.

The food was fresh, and thanks to the large number of options to choose from, there was something for everyone. \\n\\nWe went way beyond the time limit, but the waiter and waitress still came frequently to ask if we needed anything else and offered us more tea.

It can fool you into thinking it's just some off-the-beaten path, honkey-tonk BBQ joint serving up Southern food with a no-frills approach that only those who hail from this side of the Mason-Dixon line can appreciate. The amount of food that sometimes appears on your plate compared to it's coordinating price tag will appear to be unbalanced, erring on the side of rip-off. \\n\\nThe look of the place (a mix of mismatched coloring, random-ass shirts and dark, low-ceiling basement with tons of painted skeletons) may even frighten you, but would never lead you to believe that their beer list kicks ass, the service incorporates a hint of Southern hospitality and the food fills you up good, the way your momma would have made if she grew up just about a thousand miles closer to US-Mexico border.\\n\\nTake a gander at the menu and you'll see for yourself. Ribs representing every BBQ-loving state and their respective style, sides of resounding accompaniment, including fried okra, mac & cheese and candied yams.  Combo platters serve to let you sample these rich, artery-clogging dishes in multitudes, and they are just so gosh darn nice when you ask to swap components of this complied creations. Flexibility is appreciated.\\n\\nSo if you're hankering for some down-home cooking, served in portions that may look feeble but pack a serious caloric punch, head to Red Bones, grab one of their awesome brew selections and make sure you have a bowl of wet naps on the side.

For the Lincoln Tavern, that dish is the Kobe Sliders.  Served in a pair as an appetizer, they come cooked medium rare, slathered in bacon aioli and muenster, and topped with a compact quail egg that rounds out the burger perfectly.  An utter delicacy that basically addicted me with the first bite.\\n\\nBeyond my new slider fetish, I can vouch for Lincoln's ability to take traditional dishes (french toast, salads, pizza, mac & cheese, etc.) and put their own twist on them, upgrading the quality of what are typically straightforward bar menu items.  Apart from the food, the place just has a good feel to it.  High ceilings, roomy booths, a long, spacious bar area, and a density of young 20/early 30-somethings, often in groups, give it a neighborhoody feel that is still welcoming to outsiders (I'm a Back Bay'er).\\n\\nBottom line: if you're already in Southie, you ought to hang out here if you don't already know about it.

They are primarily a breakfast and lunch spot, but on Friday and Saturday nights they are open as well. I lucked out as they were offering all night happy hour!\\n\\nThe menu is quite a bit more extensive than Tom Douglas's Serious Biscuit eatery in Seattle. Having tried Pine State now, I can absolutely say that Serious Biscuit pales in comparison as it is pricier and not quite as good.\\n\\nThe happy hour menu had a selection of biscuit sandwiches along with a number of cocktail selections which is something not offered at Serious Biscuit. I decided to get the signature biscuit sandwich, the Reggie ($5 HH), a side of hushpuppies ($2.50) and a bourbon & ginger ale cocktail ($5 HH). If you want Maker's Mark bourbon in the cocktail, add a buck additional.\\n\\nThe Reggie comes with fried chicken, bacon & cheese with sausage gravy surrounding the biscuit. The sandwich was larger than I expected and delicious as advertised. With the gravy and the bulk of the biscuit to consider, I ended up mostly eating the biscuit using the silverware. If you decide to eat it with your hands, be prepared to get your hands dirty.\\n\\nThat said, getting your hands dirty isn't a bad thing. Particularly if it is covered with the sausage gravy which is heavenly and sublime. As my profile indicates, I propose my last meal on Earth to be chicken fried steak. If that is the case, may the gravy be the one from Pine State. In fact, forget the chicken fried steak. Just drown me in gravy.\\n\\nThe hushpuppies are another treat. The six piece portion is quite a generous helping. It also comes along with a spicy dipping sauce. This was a nice comfort dish to go along with the biscuit sandwich. Even the cocktail was impressive. I was surprised by how well the combination of bourbon and ginger ale works.\\n\\nThe ambiance here is quite nice too. There is outdoor seating available along with some countertop seating in which you can see staffers preparing the food.\\n\\nMy meal at Pine State was flawless.

We put our name in with the host who correctly predicted an hour wait.  We were hungry, but we figured it would be worth the wait.  We were seated and ordered our burgers.  We both ordered them medium rare.  When the burgers came they were both charred, dry hunks of hamburger,  I can honestly say it was the worst hamburger I have had in Columbus and I moved here in 1982.  It was so overcooked that it was bland and tasteless.  We should have sent them back, but instead we vowed to never come back.  It's the most over-hyped place in town.

Got here at 9:00am on a Saturday and although there was a line waiting for the restaurant to open, everyone waiting was able to be seated. All of the workers at this restaurant are incredibly friendly and helpful, 5 stars purely based on service. This is a more \\"sharing, family style\\" type of restaurant but I came here alone and only ordered 1 dish. I got the STEAK AND CHEDDAR EGGS and BISCUIT. My favorite part about the steak and eggs were the scrambled eggs and cornbread-ish pancake the meal comes with. Eggs were buttery and fluffy, and the pancake was something I have never tried before but enjoyed. It pretty much tasted like cornbread in the shape of a pancake. I got my steak medium rare but felt it was a but too dry, tough, and salty. There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu but just didn't have anymore room in my stomach. If I could do it over, I would of wanted to try the Korean Fried Chicken. Overall, I enjoyed my meal but felt the steak was a bit too tough and salty for my taste.

This was my splurge dining spot while in town. I was pretty much walking all over town looking for a nice restaurant for dinner when I finally settled on Little Bird.\\n\\nBy the time I had arrived, it was past 9 pm. Despite the lateness, Little Bird was at full capacity on a holiday weekend Sunday evening. This is the kind of restaurant that you will want to make reservations for as it just is that popular. Even so, I went the no reservations route and tried to see if there was a seat at the bar that I could scrounge up. Alas, there was not. But I was determined, so I agreed to wait the quoted half hour for a seat.\\n\\nIt did not end up taking that long however. Probably 15-20 minutes later, I was seated. The restaurant's menu is French, but not overly so. The bistro part is more evident. The space seems a little small on the outside, but the restaurant seems to hold quite a number of dining guests. There is a second floor here with additional table seating.\\n\\nSince I was quite famished, I decided to try the chicken-fried trout ($22) and get a cup of the soup de jour ($5) which was roasted garlic soup. And given this is Portland, you have to try a Oregon craft beer when in town, so I ordered the Urban Farmhouse Ale ($5).\\n\\nThe Farmhouse Ale had a smooth taste to it which is what I was looking for. I wanted the food to speak for itself. This was my first time trying roasted garlic soup. It is creamy, but not in the usual chowder sort of way. It has got a slight bite to it as well. My entr√©e seemed to take a bit to arrive, so I was pretty much munching away on their house bread which was tasty. So much that I asked for a refill.\\n\\nAt last, the chicken-fried trout arrived. The menu name intrigued me which is why I ordered it. The entr√©e was huge and covered with fried goodness. I was glad that they gave me a side of lettuce so it would go down better. Basically if you are trying to think of this dish, think Southern fried chicken except replace the chicken with trout.\\n\\nThe trout was quite crispy. The crisp is what makes this dish work so well. There was a tartar sauce on the side. Weirdly this dish made me draw comparisons to the Filet O Fish sandwich at McDonald's. The trout here is like a perfect gourmet version of the ingredients used to make that fast food classic. I am sure my description does not sound very nice, but this really is a must try here if they have it.\\n\\nEnding the meal, it was a nice extra touch that they give you a little macaron at the end of your dinner. It is little things like this and the wonderful service I received during my visit (despite the wait) that made my meal at Little Bird great.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a cosy restaurant with great food and service downtown, Little Bird would be worth a visit. Just make sure to make reservations here in advance as it is quite popular and understandably so."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"1143 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3","text":"First I love Hooters but it has gone down hill lately. \\nTonight I got out of work and wanted a beer and take out wings.

This place is filled with business people in suits and is a very trendy spot. The cocktails are tasty but not a bang for your buck in this department.

It's big, it's got weird looking stuff, and they have all those screens that you can do a good deal with (like, say, an election-night party).  There's also a lot of art and stuff.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, as many people note, the prices on drinks are steep.  $7 for a Sammie?  I know I'm not in Kansas (or the People's Republic) anymore, but I could probably buy a 6 pack.  Also, when it does get crazy, it turns into bar central:  it's next to impossible to order anything, and I couldn't tell if they had enough people behind the bar to deal with the massive demand.\\n\\nAnd the bathrooms?  I've never seen anything like that before.  In fact, I'm kind of frightened.  I've seen stalls, urinals, pee troughs (that would be Amherst's \\"The Harp\\"), and other random things, but never a monolithic silver box, ominously plopped into the middle of the bathroom.  There were four areas carved out of the pee box:  two to pee, and two to wash your hands.  Considering the people I saw nearly accidentally peeing in the hand washing ones, this set-up is a terrible idea.  Trendy, maybe.   If the ICA had these, I'd get it.  But they don't.  I've been there.  They have regular stalls.  \\n\\nLet me give you a visualization.  Remember the Michael Bay Transformers  movie, and that All-Spark thing that Shia LeBeouf uses to kill Megatron?  The stalls kind of look like that.  Except that no one, not Autobots, Decepticons, Constructicons, Dinobots, Gobots, whoever, are fighting over it.  Not even Unicron wants anything to do with that, and he eats planets.\\n\\nOverall, from an event standpoint, it's a big place.  But the prices are too high for my own personal taste, particularly on the mixed drink/cocktail end, and it can get a little wacky when it's too crowded.\\n\\n(1/3/2012 edit):  Not really any need to update, but in retrospect my rating was too high.

They have happy hour all day long on Saturday and Sunday downstairs at the Den. Appetizers are super cheap and their seasonal beers (Pale Ale, Celtic Copper, and Cascade Pale) are $3.50!

On Sundays there is live music from 3-7pm inside the Den. \\n\\nNow, onto the best bartender in the world EVER!:\\n-Davey, the bartender, was a hoot.

We also ordered the chicken nachos appetizer, which were delicious and hit the spot. \\n-Davey let me sample his Bacon Jelly Beans... I was warned they were strange, and pretty much just bacon grease in a sugary form.. And yes, they were exactly that. Slightly disgusting and slightly delicious at the same time. \\n-Davey also hand crafted me the best bloody mary I have ever set eyes upon, let alone sapped on. He proclaimed it was the coolest bloody mary ever. Is that possible? I'm a bloody mary critic.. Well, he made the bloody mary... And the garnish? A large celery stalk with THREE levels of extra garnishes: 3rd level (top level) had a slice of bacon, crouton, and Laughing Cow Cheese. 2nd level (middle level) had a tomato, green onion, and cocktail onion. 1st level (bottom level) had a cucumber slice, red bell pepper slice, yellow bell pepper slice, green bell pepper slice, and radish slice.

After ordering, you're welcome to sit anywhere in their large patio area, which is host to different events every night ranging from trivia nights to an adult comedy troupe. The water is self-serve, so drink to your hearts content, and there's often a bar right across from Patrizi's truck. \\n\\nExpect your food to cost $15-20 per person, which is a tad more than I'd generally like to pay for a meal, but it's well worth the money.

My wife and I took a long walk along SE Hawthorne Blvd, Buckman from our rental duplex to check out all the restaurants, cafes, bars and whatever. It was quite a long walk and we found a lot of options for lunch. We stopped in here on the way out and had a chat with a hostess named Lisa who said there was a 20-30 minute wait but things eased off around 1.30pm. The place was really packed with lines out the door at just after 11am. We looked at the menu and it was quite huge but mainly breakfast dishes however they did have espressos so we put them on our maybe list. In the end after looking at a lot of the dining options on the strip we took a lyft back here at around 1.20pm. Hostess Lisa spotted us when we walked in and showed us to a small table for 2 in the huge main dining room. I switched us out to a larger table for 4 in a better location. A hip looking server named Shelby  came by with plastic glasses of water and asked to take our lunch order. We told Shelby we wanted 2 hazelnut lattes to kick things off while we mulled over the limited lunch menu. As Lisa told us earlier this place is all about breakfast which they serve all day. The background hip hop music thumping out loudly was utterly horrible but this place was our choice for lunch and it was raining & quite chilly outside. Out lattes came out and tasted pretty decent. They use Merigold Coffee Roasters here. My wife ordered a Grilled Cheese Sandwich and I decided on a BBQ Pork Sandwich sans the bag of potato chips... who needs them ? Our orders arrived quickly and looked alright but nothing flash ! My wife's Grilled Cheese Sandwich had the disgusting Yellow Cheddar on it and my BBQ Pork Sandwich was on a Ciabatta which was very soggy. The slow cooked pulled Pork tasted fine but there is no way the ciabatta had been grilled.

I had to stop coming here even though I love it because the last 4 TIMES IN A ROW that I ordered food, there was either a long black hair, or short beard-hair in my food. It's nauseating to find it when you are 1/2 or almost finished eating your food. The 2nd to last time, I ordered a Allston Sunrise sandwich. They don't cut it, so I got a plastic knife and cut it in half. When I pulled the two sides apart, in the middle was a women's hair through the entire sandwich. I asked for my money back and went next door to Common Ground to get breakfast, because I couldn't keep spending money and not being able to eat my food. It's frustrating because it could be such a solid place, and I want to be able to eat here. I've heard that there isn't much incentive for the employees to keep high standards, as few of them get a pay raise and there's no solid management.

Instead, this man's humble opinion will focus on the unknown or underloved items offered by the North End icon.\\n\\nAnnouncing, Neptune's Goonies:\\n\\n- The Mikey: If Brandon is the lobster roll, then Neptune's soft-spoken clam chowder earns his asthmatic little brother's moniker. Bold in its own right, thinner than peers yet meatier where it counts.\\n\\n- The Fratellis: Tuna and cold veal is a winning combination Italians have known for generations, and Neptune's vitello tonnato sandwich ($19) will undoubtedly grab you by the gabagools or whatever the Sopranos call \\"your balls.\\" Easily my most ordered dish, roasted sliced veal topped with sushi-grade tuna tartare, cool marinated cucumber and a wasabi spread. Boasting the same amazing dark russet fries that side the lob roll, you've gotta give this guy a try.\\n\\n- The Data: Kumamoto oysters served regularly. Little, shiny, slightly fruity pearls of love. A mist of mignonette and I get slick shoes. Buy as many as you can with your FIFTY DOLLAR BILL.\\n\\n- The Mouth, aka Corey Feldman: Raw, fresh, remarkably delicate and surprising us daily, look to the Crudo Special.\\n\\n- The Chunk: A perfectly seasoned cheddar cheeseburger under fried oysters, aioli and a pickle relish.

This seafood restaurant started in 2004 and the restaurant was ranked #79 in \\"Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the US for 2016\\".\\n\\nI mean holy cow ... the door wasn't even open at 11 AM on Monday and the line had already formed! In fact, the line even went around the block by 11:30 AM! I was the 20th person in the line at 11 AM and was also among the first wave of customers (generally speaking the first wave of customers are the first 30 people in line).\\n\\nLet's get straight to the point - Neptune Oyster's signature item is HOT Maine lobster roll with butter (with an option of fries or salad for side dish). Unfortunately, I should not overhear and listen to the lady who sat right next to me at the bar seats because she influenced my decision and ultimately made me order traditional cold lobster roll with mayo instead. Five minutes later I tried to fix my mistake by asking my waitress whether I could switch my order from cold to hot lobster roll. And the next thing I knew, cold lobster roll came out and she simply said \\"oh your order is here already\\". The staff was definitely busy handling waves of customers, but I am still in shock that she couldn't even handle my simple request considering how many hot and cold lobster rolls they serve to customers.\\n\\nOh if you are allergic to seafood, you will only find two non-seafood option on the menu - rib eye steak and burger with fried oysters (okay so burger is not exactly a non-seafood option). Since it is also an oyster house, you will also get a ordering sheet for various oysters from different regions (with detailed descriptions on salt level and flavor profiles). I did notice that saltier oysters were more expensive than oysters with less salt.\\n\\n***\\n\\nMaine Lobster Roll (toasted brioche roll cold with mayo, market price $31): I got the traditional lobster roll and honestly it was a great lobster roll (better than the one at Red's Best Seafood) - just meaty lobster with toasty brioche roll. Salad tasted alright and nothing to write home about.\\n\\nSavage Blond (Bedeque Bay, Prince Edward Island, Canada - $3.30) and Kumamoto (Shelton, Washington - $3.50): Personally I like Savage Blond better than Kumamoto. The flavor profile for Kumamoto described it as low salt, but it still tasted slightly saltier than I expected.\\n\\n***\\n\\nVery solid cold lobster roll (even though I regret not getting hot lobster roll) and overall I would give 4.5-star on their food, but I have to round down to 4-star due to non-attentive bar service, long waiting line, and hefty price."},{"name":"Xiang Yu China Bistro","address":"1223 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"A beautiful setting for fabulous dining!

If you don't offer it be brave and say we don't serve it. It might be that it changes the flavor of the beans, it may cause cancer, shit it may even be against every fiber of your being. but give a dude an option. start by saying hi or instead educate me on why you don't serve it or build a dialog which reflects why you started your business in the first place.

I misread one of the lines as \\"lowering your expectations\\", which I thought humorous because it actually would make ordering (and eating) at Solly's a far less frustrating process. It actually says \\"exceptions\\". The last line asks that customers be kind and patient with their employees.

It seems as if there is a lobster roll joint on every corner in Boston...which is great. I love lobster. I actually had two lobster rolls during my 4-day excursion to the New England area. Thanks to Boston, my cholesterol level is probably through the roof at my tender age of 25. No regrets though! I stumbled upon Luke's Lobster by chance my first night and I'm glad I did.\\n\\nLuke's Lobster offers lobster rolls, shrimp rolls, and crab rolls all served Maine style meaning the seafood is chilled with mayo rather than served hot and buttered. If you're looking for hot and buttered - look elsewhere! Luke's does a fantastic job with their lobster rolls. Lobster meat is already really rich so when you pair it with a toasted bun, you can't go wrong. The bun has the perfect amount of toast to where it's got a solid crunch without the crumbly mess and the lighter taste of the bread balances the richness of the lobster well. The rolls here are pretty petite sized but it all works out because too much lobster gets old fast. Don't get me wrong, they definitely pack a LOT of lobster into the bun. Since the rolls are the size they are, that leaves room for you to order a side of Jonah crab claws or a small lobster bisque. In my case, I got both (I ain't afraid to chow down!)  The lobster bisque wasn't my cup of tea. It didn't have the smooth, creamy, and rich texture/taste that I am used to but it came with a good amount of lobster meat so they ain't skimpin'. The Jonah crab claws were so sweet and fresh! You don't even need the cocktail sauce it comes with. You can eat them by themselves. I like that Luke's lists the calories next to each food item.

The gargantuan burgers typically are not my thing I did decide to try it out since it had such great reviews. To my surprise it's a very quaint small building that sits in the middle of a quiet peaceful little Neighbourhood. It attracts many of the locals and regulars of the neighborhood so it seems to be very busy even in the middle of the day . prepare for a long wait if you're with company, if you were by yourself you may be able to snag a seat at the bar which is first-come. The atmosphere is very hometown and reminds me of a small town College bar the walls are covered in thousands of single dollar bills with people's sayings and signatures, which does have a very cool feel. Now the food, I ordered a western burger which had bacon cheese barbecue sauce lettuce tomato and onion with a side of fries and gravy. First comma I had ordered the burger medium rare however when it came to tableside it was well done. The fries work soggy and a little raw in the middle and mostly small little tidbits which you would find at the bottom of the bag. Since the burgers are so large it does take a while 4 then 2 cook,  so I did not have time to wait on another correctly cooked Burger. When one of the bartenders heard me tell the woman sitting next to me that she should order rare if she wanted it medium rare, she asked me if I wanted another one, when I had told her that I just simply don't have time I would have expected a possible discount on my check which most places would have done, but to my surprise they offered nothing. As for the flavor,  I simply  didn't  find that there was much flavor just a very large amount of ground beef  overcooked  with  small amount of cheese that I could not even taste ,over cooked bacon  that was flat and hard,  with a small drizzle of barbecue sauce.

Joey D's was within walking distance and the menu looked good. \\n\\nI was by myself this evening, and I had not made reservations. The hostesses suggested I wait for a spot at the bar. After about ten minutes of seeing that wasn't likely to be an option anytime soon, I put my name in for a table. 30 minutes later I was seating in the dining area. On a Thursday night. So, my first recommendation here, is you probably want reservations if you don't want a wait, no matter what day it is.\\n\\nMy server was very nice, he did a great job all around. The noise level is pretty high, but, like I said, it's super crowded, so it's not a surprise. \\n\\nI ordered the Onion soup and a salad to start. They were both good. I also ordered the ribeye steak, and it was good, but a touch underseasoned. Not enough to complain about, just enough for me to notice. All of these choices were good, they just didnt blow me away, as I go to a lot of steakhouses. this one is good for the price point. I took a slice of cheesecake to go. This was a great idea. The cheesecake was dense and rich and I was so glad I had it. I wish they had thrown in a little silverware, because my hotel room was not equipped. \\n\\nOverall, Joey D's is good. If I'm in town, I would probably go there again, if I wasn't closer to another steakhouse."},{"name":"Imperial Fez","address":"2285 Peahtree Rd NE, Ste 102","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"We were in Atlanta two weeks ago for the gift show and one of our vendors suggested going to dinner at the Imperial Fez since it was his favorite Atlanta restaurant. It was also one of our friends birthday, which made the evening more celebratory than a business outing. Since it was a Friday, we called in a reservation for 6 at 8:30 pm. \\n\\nWe arrived on time and were immediately greeted and seated. The server showed up a few minutes later and explained the menu options. We opted for the prix fixe (had to google spelling) 4 course dinner, soup, appetizer or salad, main course, then desert. 4 course dinner prices ranged between $35 to about $65 depending on choice of main course. One of the guests was allergic to cinnamon and the server assured her the chef will prepare her appetizer separately and he did. \\n\\nOur orders were taken, then our hands were washed at the table using some kind or kettle and urn, in case we decided not to use utensils and eat with our hands. \\n\\nWe received out drinks and then multiple kinds of breads and harissa sauce (extremely spicy hot), followed by our lentil soup, which was a little spicy but delicious. There was no rush and took out time with each course. The appetizer/salads followed and the consensus was more pro-appetizer than salads. Bastila is similar to a puff pastry stuffed with a mixture of chicken, eggs, herbs, nuts, and spices, and slightly dusted with cinnamon and confection sugar. It was an interestingly delicious concoction. \\n\\nHalfway through the meal, the belly dancing show started and lasted about 25 min. They took a break and came back out every 30-40 min. \\n\\nThe main course was the best part. Chicken kebabs, lamp shank, cornish hen, and best of all my branzini fish tagine. It was to die for! \\n\\nDesert consisted mint tea, a chocolate/coconut pastry, along with fresh cut exotic fruit including pomegranate, kaki (persimmon), pineapple, etc. \\n\\nWe let them know of the birthday and the staff/dancers came out to sing with a candle while playing an arabic version of \\"happy birthday\\" song. It was a lot of fun. There were at least 4 other birthday parties in the room. \\n\\nOverall, it took us about 3 hrs to finish our dinner and we didn't feel rushed and had nowhere else to go. Everyone was happy with the choice and decided to come back with more friends in 6 months when we visit again for the summer gift show."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was really excited to try this place, I had heard great things about the ambiance but sadly our experience was not so great.\\n\\nWe ventured here for happy hour with a group of 7, we found an awesome spot in the corner with amazing views. \\n\\nOur waitress greeted our group and we started putting in our drink orders. One in our group inquired if there was a possibility of a spicy martini. Our waitress excitedly said there was and it would not be a problem. \\n\\nAbout 5 minutes later we get our drinks, with the exception of the spicy martini. Our waitress advises that they needed to run to the back to get an ingredient for it. \\n\\nTen more minutes go by and our waitress returns to advise the original drink she put in for cannot be made but that they substituted it out and that they are \\"working on it\\". \\n\\nAt this point we are still missing on drink, the waitress stops by a few more times- no drink in hand stating \\"it is being made right now\\" etc etc.\\n\\nAfter the is being made it commented we waited another 10 minutes before one person from our party walked  up to the bar to request out check.

We just inquired how removing a drink we never got was taking care of it for us to which he said here's your bill and walked away. \\n\\nNeedless to say it was a really poor experience.\\n\\nI want to add we had 3 members of our table who have over 10 years of experience each in working in a bar so we are completely understanding that stuff happens... but to insure several times it was being made and never offer a replacement drink or any other kind of solution or just stand there and watch the bartender make the drink after realizing how much time had elapsed seems like a misstep."},{"name":"Koharu Japanese Restaurant","address":"6115 Peachtree Dunwoody Rd, Ste K120","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Koharu is a japanese restaurant that seems small from the outside but is quite spacious once your in.

Dinner was so disappointing that I would have given Frank two stars were it not for brunch. Maybe I should not have had such high expectations, but not only is this the project of the former chef of L'Espalier, but it is priced and styled to make it an occasion restaurant (I mean, not on the level of L'Espalier, thank goodness). We were there for a double 50th birthday dinner.\\n\\nWhat was so wrong with it? Service for one. Our server was well meaning but honestly, not competent. She knew little to nothing about any beverages we asked about (including beer, cocktails, and by the glass wines- a limited selection, which I don't mind as a diner, but staff really need to know when there are so few options). Team service ensured our water glasses were usually full, but a couple of times dirty flatware and plates were still cluttering the table when new food arrived. Our server also did not know details about some of the dishes and ingredients and never followed up despite saying she would. \\n\\nMost ridiculously service-wise, a manager - who seemed much more experienced and polished initially - cleared our final round of plates when one diner wasn't finished. We caught him and he returned the partially-full bouillabaisse graciously, and promised he would send bread service out so the diner could finish his dish as he wished to (soaking up the last broth is always the best part). Instead, so much time went by that the soup was stone cold by the time the manager came back......when he just whisked the rest of it away on his way somewhere else.\\n\\nBeverage program was not good. Starter cocktails took a while to arrive, which we were told we because the bar was busy but I think they just got forgotten. An Old Fashioned-type was half water from melted ice and much too sweet, and my seasonal martini (made with a very piney gin and seemingly nothing else) was room temperature. I did like the half pours of bubbly they gave us on the house with dessert, but I can't tell you what it was because I asked the server and she told me it was...wait for it...sparkling wine. \\n\\nFood was hit or miss. A duck egg starter was nice but forgettable. Sweet potato, charred romaine, smoked tomatoes and blue cheese had delicious components but hung together poorly. Smoky eggplant dip was very nice but came with disappointing olives- pitted, soft, not flavorful. The aforementioned bouillabaisse had pricey ingredients but was overwhelmed with saffron and unfortunately most of the seafood was way overcooked. A \\"pulled pork cassoulet\\" was mostly lentils and bore no resemblance to cassoulet whatsoever in terms of flavor profile or assembly- no big chunks of stewed things with different textures, just soft stew with some breadcrumbs on top. Duck breast: I was not asked temperature and it was served firmly medium, a couple pieces medium well. Not great, though it was still tender and decently enjoyable. I asked for a side of Brussels sprouts and those were crispy and roasty and fabulous though.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is just beautiful, with a thoughtful layout that makes every table seem like a \\"good\\" table. Bathrooms are the holy grail: single stalls, unisex, a lock that tells you the vacancy status. (They were not super clean during our dinner visit, though.) Lighting and decor and music are all tasteful and pleasant while leaving dining at the center of the experience. I hope to see it evolve to deserve such a spotlight, I was looking forward to becoming a regular."},{"name":"Pizza Lovers","address":"61 Essex St","city":"Lynn","stars":"2.5","text":"Stopped here on my way home from work, we didn't call in our order.

The salad is served cold/room temperature with mango, apples and pears.  The salad was dressed with a fish sauce, rice vinegar & cilantro base.  It was a refreshing and delicious salad.

I don't know why she was in a rush to get us out since the restaurant wasn't very busy and we were spending $300.

While it's a really clean place with a lot of natural light, it also has some grunge to it. It's hard to find a coffee shop (with tasty coffee) in Austin that isn't completely pretentious, but I feel like Epoch is a good happy medium. They have outdoor seating, but it's always to sunny to sit out there. I'm hoping that one day they will put up a tarp, so I don't have to go to Starbucks when it's too crowded!

Chicken fried rice was average.  The Mongolian Beef was 2/5....since it's not on the menu, they basically gave me pepper steak without the peppers and different onions.  Mongolian Beef and Pepper steak are cooked two different ways in two different sauces...nice try though.  Egg drop soup was average as was the wonton soup.  Prices for lunch are decent, $5.95 for most things including a drink and fried rice or soup. \\n\\nThis will be my goto place in Powell when I went General Tso's.\\n\\nI've lowered my rating because this place just screws up all the time.  One time we ordered online and they forgot part of our order.  Another time they gave me the wrong size portion of food, the solo dinner meal vs. the family size.  They have over charged me a couple times and another we ordered and waited 15 minutes to go get it and they forgot to cook our food or misplaced our order so I had to put it in again and wait."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here w/ friends during happy hour and I came out full and satisfied.

We wanted to have lunch here. There was a short line and as I approached the host, they would take down your name and number and call you whwn your table is about ready.  I really appreciated this system because we didn't have to line up outside and wait for 2 hrs..which is when we were told we would get served.   2 hrs of wait....it was okay. While waiting for our call, we toured the area.\\n\\nFast forward 2 hrs later, we got to be seated and I knew already what I wanted! We had to have their fresh oysters, the lobster roll and local beer. Then, we added mussels.  \\n\\nSince we aren't locals, we had to try their local oysters. We got to try 4 varieties. Ask your server for suggestions if you want local ones which we did.  They were all delicious and superbly fresh!  Next, we got the lobster roll with salad. You can have it with fries too if you prefer.  The lobster roll is amazing! Fresh, sweet and juicy. Cooked perfectly.  We also ordered the mussels with spicy chorizo which gave the dish a nice kick to it.  It comes with grilled bread to dip into the flavorful broth.  Simply heaven! I was so happy like a little kid enjoying this seafood treat while on vacation. Everything we ate was a perfect match with the beer we drank.\\n\\nI am glad that 2 hours of wait time didn't steer me from not trying out this place.  Our server was also superb!

The wait staff was excellent, quite friendly, and we got our coveted lobster rolls very quickly. We could hardly sit still as the waitress brought our food to the table. The grilled bun was almost falling apart because it was packed with so much lobster meat and dripping with hot butter. The first bite had me singing praises to Neptune, God of the Sea. If I had to choose between the two sandwiches, I would (after much thought) say the cold with mayo was better, but it would be a difficult choice because both were excellent. I felt that the butter in the hot with butter overpowered the taste of the lobster. I was able to taste the lobster flavor a little better in the cold with mayo, but if you prefer a warm sandwich or are not a fan of mayo definitely stick with the hot with butter.

You gotta admit, the idea of a secret door with a pass code/retina scanner entrance sounds prettttty cool.\\n\\nMy friend got a reservation here so we did ladies night with a group of four. You put in the pass code and the door opens to a tiny dark anteroom, where we were greeted by a bouncer and the hostess stand. Once the hostess confirmed we weren't riffraff, they pressed a button that opened up the next door to let us into the cocktail lounge. We entered and the door automatically closed behind us. I felt a little bad for hostess and bouncer. That room was barely bigger than a walk-in closet. It must get pretty boring in there.\\n\\nThe lounge is chic and sophisticated without being stuffy or uncomfortable. However, the music was a little more *unce* *unce* *unce* than what I would expect from a high end speakeasy. Something slower and more chill would better match the overall atmosphere, like the song from their website (http://www.puraibeto.com/himitsu/) or pretty much anything that could be in the background of James Bond sipping on a martini.\\n\\nFrom the Barracat on the table to the bidet in the bathroom, it's obvious that Himitsu strives for first class quality and attention to detail in every aspect of the experience. If you've never heard of Barracat, they make crystal stemware and other knickknacks for rich people, e.g. $500 candles and $38,000 vases. If I'm drinking out of something I can't afford to break, it better be nothing short of the fountain of youth. The Toryufu cocktail came pretty close. Made with pear-infused vodka and white truffle honey, it's a must try for truffle oil fanatics. For those who aren't weirdly obsessed with truffles like I am, I would recommend the Raichi instead ($16, lychee-cello, lemon grapefruit, and rosewater), which is also delicious and one of their most popular drinks.\\n\\nTheir food menu is limited to small bites that are best for sharing. We ordered the following:\\n--Edamame ($6): really good even though I'm usually against ordering it because it costs $2 to make at home\\n--Edamame hummus ($10): comes with refills of pita chips, it didn't really do it for me but I'm not a big hummus person\\n--Ito-Gio pizza ($15): sashimi tuna on flatbread with truffle oil, small portion but delicious\\n--Scallop Tiradito ($18): scallop sashimi with cilantro and sea salt similar to Peruvian-style ceviche, holyyyy crap it was amazing I didn't want it to end\\nThey also have a dessert menu with a green tea creme brulee that I really want to try next time. \\n\\nAll in all, this is a great place to grab a drink before dinner or a nightcap and dessert. Pricey but overall a solid spot worth checking out with a date or small group if you have the chance.\\n\\nYas: Drinks (Toryufu, Raichi), food (Scallop Tiradito, Ito-Gio pizza), atmosphere\\nMeh: $$$$ (and no free tap water)"},{"name":"Big D's Neponset Cafe","address":"497 Washington St","city":"Canton","stars":"4","text":"Had great homemade dinner tonight great pasta and sauce and meatballs .

I came here with a group of 19 for a friend's birthday party.  From what I heard, Joey D's does not take reservations, but instead has \\"priority seating\\" (whatever that means).  We told the restaurant we'd be there at 8:30pm on a Saturday night.  While they were very busy that night, they were still able to seat us on time, so kudos to them for that.\\n\\nJoey D's is a classic American restaurant with an old-fashioned, upscale look.  Atmosphere is somewhat country club-esque.  The restaurant has an open kitchen and a massive showcase bar with hundreds of spirits on display.  The bar looks pretty cool and is the centerpiece of the restaurant.  The crowd at this restaurant is generally middle age and above.  The servers are straight-laced, wearing white shirts and black ties.  The men's restroom has mouthwash and lotion.\\n\\n\\"Steaks, seafood, and salads\\" are the specialty here.  Items I tried:\\n\\nHoney-butter croissants\\nGrilled grouper\\nChicken BBQ sandwich\\nShort rib ravioli\\n\\nThe honey-butter croissants are one of the most popular menu items at Joey D's.  Not a bad appetizer by any means, but it's just a croissant with honey-butter glaze on top.\\n\\nI ordered the daily fresh fish, which happened to be grouper on the night we went.  This entree came with a house or Caesar salad and one side for $28.95.  I chose creamed spinach as the side.\\n\\nSad to say, this entree was fail all-around.  The grouper amounted to a small char-grilled filet with no flavor whatsoever.  Actually, it did have some flavor -- the bitterness of the burn marks from the grill.  The grouper was sitting all by itself, naked, on the plate.  There was no sauce or other small foods to complement the fish.  It did not taste very good and I forced myself to finish it.  It's never a good thing when you have to force yourself to chew and swallow a restaurant's food.\\n\\nLike the grouper, the creamed spinach was seriously lacking.  I'm not trying to be mean, but the creamed spinach you can get at Boston Market or in the frozen food aisle at the grocery store are better than Joey D's version.\\n\\nOne of my tablemates ordered the chicken BBQ sandwich.  It consisted of pulled BBQ chicken inside of a thick bun.  The server who took our order recommended it to her, telling her it was a popular selection and \\"really good.\\"  She took two bites of it (and a couple bites of the cole slaw) and stopped there.  I tried a bite and realized why.  The meat was dry and bland.  The short rib ravioli was okay.  The Madeira sauce helped a lot.\\n\\nOne of the girls sitting across from me ordered the Southwest chicken penne.  She ate about a quarter of it and put the rest of it in a to-go box.  When it came time to leave, she decided to leave the leftovers.\\n\\nI rarely (and don't enjoy to) rip on a business, but Joey D's was one of my worst ever dining experiences (food-wise) in Atlanta.

They offer traditional (on the bone) and boneless options, and also have fries and other sides available. Perfect for a late night snack on its own or as bar food if you choose to get a drink at Lustre Pearl, the bar this food truck is located inside.\\n\\nAs several other reviewers have pointed out, you do need a valid ID just to get food from this food truck. They do not allow you to order from outside the bar. So, steer clear if you have kids or are under 21.\\n\\nThis would have been a five star review if it weren't for the following: \\n\\nThe wings take at least 15-20 minutes to be prepared. They're made fresh, which is great, but it also means that unless you're drinking at the bar, you're pretty much going to be hanging around waiting for the food to be ready.\\n\\n$7 for 5 chicken lollipops isn't really great value, plus you have to pay extra (75 cents) for a dipping sauce (ranch, blue cheese, or any of the sauces the wings are prepared in). They do not give celery or carrots with the wings, so there isn't a lot to cut through all the heaviness.\\n\\nThe spice level of the sauces might not be accurate. I ordered the OG (sriracha based with a hint of sweetness), which was at a Medium on their scale, and it was definitely spicier than sriracha and should've been ranked higher on the spice level. However, this is much more subjective, so I'm not holding it against them.\\n\\nI'd love to visit again and try out one of their other offerings!"},{"name":"PHO NAM ATL","address":"99 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I loved my pork vermicelli bowl that had fresh and bold flavors.

We ultimately opted for some standing space by the bar.\\n\\nBetween two, we ordered the Grilled Octopus, Foie Gras, The Driver's Seat (with vodka), and a Kentucky Peach. Everything was splendid--the Grilled Octopus was a perfect balance of charred, crunchy, and chewy; the Foie Gras couldn't have been seared any better and it paired so well with the pineapple jam and toast; The Driver's Seat was a refreshing and unique twist and blend of earl grey tea syrup, peppermint, lemon, Yerba Buena bitters, and soda. I didn't try the Kentucky Peach, but the bf seemed to have enjoyed it. Faves from the night: the Foie Gras (the foie + pineapple jam pairing surprised me) and The Driver's Seat (with vodka).\\n\\nThe second time we came back was on a Sunday, around 5:30p, and the place was already filled w/ a small waitlist--we were able to snag two seats at the bar though! This time, we tried the Seared Scallops, The Driver's Seat (with vodka, again), and the Toki Americano. The Seared Scallops were so sweet and fantastic with its light crust and tender insides--not to mention it came drizzled with a mouthwatering green Romesco sauce. The Driver's Seat (with vodka) was as expected and I didn't try the Toki Americano.\\n\\nIn hindsight, I really wish I had ordered the Foie Gras again on our second visit. It was so good.....dang it.

I was a little surprised at how quiet it was, but I blame that on the laziness of millennials in making their way out to this part of the South End. It had a dark and sexy vibe, like many of the other cocktail bars emerging in Boston, which provided for a nice, intimate spot to catch up with some people I hadn't seen in awhile. I arrived late, but luckily my friends had all secured a large high top table in the back. Food and drink seemed reasonably priced - all cocktails are $13, which is market for Boston, and the portions of the food were generous. My friends tried the burger, fries, and churros, and everyone seemed pretty pleased. I've seen other Yelpers call this one of the \\"best burgers in Boston\\".\\n\\nOur service was great, we had a waitress who would check in frequently and made sure we never had an empty glass for long. I had the \\"fizz\\", but substituted gin for the bourbon and it was a great drink. A little on the sweet side, but a very flavorful balance of liquors I normally wouldn't think of and the sprig of rosemary topped it off with the earthy finish you want from a cocktail with gin. We ended up switching from cocktails to a bottle of malbec, and half a bottle of wine later, I realized I had stayed at a bar until last call for the first time since college.\\n\\nGood spot for a more upscale, yet laid back, drinks and snacks with friends.

On the way to our cars, one of my fellow diners summed his experience up by saying \\"I felt like I just ate glorified Luby's cafeteria food\\". These are blanket statements, so I'll try and be more specific:\\n        Let's begin with the setting. There isn't any signage whatsoever for Mae. Instead you have to walk to another restaurant and get directions (awkward), some people came in behind me and did exactly the same thing. Must be awkward for the other restaurant as well. So, after walking behind this restaurant and through their parking lot you get to Mae's. My party was already seated. It was a chilly night, yet no heat in the space. I saw many fellow diners put their coats back on. You're seated communally which I am never a fan of. And, it's BYOB so many of our fellow diners had copious amounts of alcohol (on a Monday no less), so they were plenty loud. And the space is small, and the acoustics make for quite an echo. This makes many fellow diners get into what we affectionately called \\"talking shouting matches\\". Plainly put, this place is LOUD. As in you can't speak to the person next to you and be heard. Also, you can't hear the chef explain her dishes to you either. Bummer. And those dishes........\\n       Our party of three were all very underwhelmed by every dish. The cornbread was dry and airy, such a strange way to bake cornbread, as we were all accustomed to more moist cornbread. We also thought the presentation was very off- the cornbread was baked in one of those cast iron mold tins shaped like small corn cobs. I think cornbread is at it's most beautiful and sublime when it's flipped out of a big cast iron skillet. But, that whipped sorghum butter sure was tasty. The salad was just a huge mess. No other way to put it. The fancified buttermilk ranch dressing was just fatty as fat can be. The delicate beautiful spice inside the salad \\"sumac\\" was barely noticeable as it had to fight with all the fat from the dressing. Onto the mains and sides......\\n     The fried chicken is good, but hey when is fried chicken terrible? I will say this, the batter has little to no seasoning or spice in it. It had a good texture though, but I've had better fried chicken all over the place- Nashville, Memphis, hell even in Brooklyn I've had better fried chicken. The sides. My god the sides. The poor collards were a salty salty mess. Inedible. Seriously, we had to force ourselves to take a second bite. The mac and cheese was yummy, but again just an absolute gut bomb of fat, fat, and more fat. We could barely eat a second fork full, and we are three big guys. This dish needed more of the salt and vinegar chips to offset the 3 day dose of fat. \\n      Dessert was banana pudding. The chef explained to us how important this dish is to Southerners. As Southerners, we of course knew this. This version of the ultra classic dish was good, but not anything we hadn't had before and better. \\n      No coffee or tea was provided. We didn't ask for any because we were ready to leave. Then they hit us with the tip jar. My brother, who had kindly and generously paid for the meal, was shocked. On top of the $75 per person tickets, they add gratuity?? And it's BYOB? Wow. Just wow. I've eaten at Michelin starred restaurants in NYC for less than this. This was absurd. My brother was livid. I paid the tip. We promptly left. On our way to our cars we all agreed that it's an issue of smoke and mirrors- a very branded product: \\"Southern Appalachian\\" cuisine is offered and suddenly it's in vogue in PDX. What many of the people raving about this place probably have never experienced is a Sunday meal in the South. Because everything you eat here is a lesser version of those dishes. \\n     If you want to be wowed by a chef doing imaginative, inventive, and poetic things with food, but still holding to American traditions, I'd suggest you book a seat at places like Willow or Beast instead of visiting Mae's."},{"name":"Golden China","address":"9673 Sawmill Rd","city":"Powell","stars":"3.5","text":"Ordered General Chaos chicken.

The line was about 3 people deep to order and pay and about another 5-7 people waiting for their food. Easy to spot- right off the freeway. \\n\\nIt's a two people operation with the husbands doing the cooking and the wife makes the hand pulled noodles and takes order (no worries, she's clean and changes her gloves).\\n\\nSimple menu with noodles and dumplings, but it feels like there is so much to choose from. \\n\\nI got the chao mian (8) which is the #2 on the menu with the chicken option. You can get tofu if you want. Hand stretch noodles served with stir fried veggies and protein source of your choice. PS. They spelled that way, hence why I spelled it that way. IT SMELLED SO GOOD and looked even better. So much color and grease on it with a generous amount of veggies and chunks of chicken. The flavor was spot on with a hint of spice that didn't over power or leave you feeling like you just over consumed MSG.\\n\\nI also got an order of the pan fried beef dumplings (8). Holy snap, omg omg. If you know me, I love dumplings however they come. These beef ones were no short of perfection! The skin was so so so so crispy and a little brunt. Thick enough to hold the filling in but thin enough to snag the skin with your teeth to let some air out and the juices out so you don't burn yourself. It comes \\"spicy\\" but just meant a little bit of chili seeds and oil on top. If I could eat it, then you'd be fine. They couldn't change it because that's the way the dumplings are made- so I ate as it.\\n\\nThe portions are insanely over generous, especially for the price. They were still delicious, the next day.\\n\\nThe wait took a little bit longer than expected, but you get told that up front as well. I mean the noodles have to be boiled and the fried and then tossed and same with the dumplings, which was fine by me considering how much I had to eat already. \\n\\nLike most carts, card and cash are welcome. I do appreciate that they write food contains peanuts for those with allergies. There's a sign up front that tells you to be patient due to crows and how to eat the noodles right away for the best quality and unique consistency. \\n\\nSuch an amazing new find in Portland since the last time I was here.

Lincoln's was a \\"must\\" on this list. We might have been hungover, and we had a lot to do that day, but nothing could have prepared me for what Lincoln really is.  The only way I can describe it is it's like the college bars, with good food, good atmosphere, and all happens between 10am-2pm.  The place was jam packed, with everyone between the age of 22-30. Every girl was all done up, and every bro was ready for a night out, all at noon. Everyone was in massive groups, with huge champagne bottles and ridiculous amounts of food. Hangover cure, or recipe for a hangover, I am not sure if it matters since the only goal here seems to be to get drunk, find a fling, and relive college. BTW, these are all good things. \\n\\nWe sat at a bar, and figured we might as well cure our hangover with a drink and greasy food. I'm not gonna lie, the pizza and food was surprisingly really good. Like not what you would expect at a college bar, which I guess is the point of Lincoln. To be able to socialize and drink in a way similar to college, except everyone is young pro's now. I also will add the decoration was festive, with beautiful christmas decor.. The space was also massive. My question kept being, \\"How did I not know this existed? How does this exist? Why haven't we been here?\\". Hopefully the answer isn't that we are too far out of college."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Spin the wheel!

The fried tofu salad was a very decent attempt at a healthy somethingerother, but I wouldn't want to order it again. The Coconut Curry Bowl is $14, yet it tasted like something I could make myself and my wife banned me years ago from making any Asian cuisine because I made things that very closely resemble the Coconut Curry Bowl.

The logo, handpainted on the front windows, looks like something I might have doodled on my Trapper Keeper during my brief Born-Again phase when I was about 14. The branding might lead you to assume that this is (a) a breakfast place, (b) a hippie-dippy place along the lines of Sweet Melissa's, (c) not a restaurant at all but a storefront church of some kind. They do serve breakfast, but otherwise it's completely different from what you might expect based on the exterior. The food is very sophisticated (and not inexpensive), as are the wine/beer/cocktail lists. The service is casual but professional. Everything I've had here has been a truly elevated version of classic Southern food.

While the remodel certainly makes the old steamboat appear groovy and chic, it ultimately just masks an otherwise overpriced Disney restaurant that doesn't have much more to offer than some scenic views of Disney Springs.  To start, the acoustic are absolutely awful.  The place is so loud, yet somehow every word you say gets lost in the room so it's nearly impossible to hear anything that's going on. Second, when I went to the restroom, I noticed that the kitchen door is right next to the women's bathroom door & the waiter/ waitresses literally bring your fresh food out of the kitchen and run into women exiting the bathroom.  This is seriously disturbing considering how many germs come flying out of that bathroom every second of the day.  \\nThe food was good, but for the price you pay for a steak or piece of fish, I would'e expected a side to be included.  The size of the side of potatoes that we had to order in addition to our meal was unfortunately small.  We ordered the sea bass & the black cod, and while the bass was very tasty, the cod was unbelievably bland, as I found myself reaching for the salt shaker multiple times.  The complimentary bread is disappointing, however the lobster corn dogs were very tasty and something I've never seen before.\\nOverall this place has some serious design flaws as well as execution flaws in delivering up to the standard of their theming.

It's still good but to us, it's not great anymore and not worth a long wait for food.\\n\\nWe found out why it has slipped.

Extremely chewy (perhaps cut the wrong way or just bad quality) over a bed of beansprouts and a tad of other veggies. Hence, the sizzling plate incurred a bed of liquid in no time. Sizzle me no more!

I suppose the cabbage is cheaper than the noodles.\\n\\nChicken Wings Korean Style - 4 pieces for 7.95! Technically, 2 wings cut into 4. I never had such gourmet wings before! And never will again.\\n\\nYook Hwe -  Raw beef is my favorite Korean dish. This generous portion of beef was not complimented with a generous portion of julienne pears.

We scoped this place out online soon after we checked into our airbnb in nearby Buckman. The lure of wood - fired pizza, house made ice cream & craft beer was the perfect bait. Of course the high rating reviews were just our model so we decided to have dinner here on our first evening in Portland. We drove slowly down Mississippi Ave but it was packed out around 6pm so we found a parking spot in a back street for our huge SUV rental. We walked a few hundred yards down the main drag past various eateries & bars but decided none looked tempting enough to change our mind. The restaurant was very busy when we walked in around 6.30pm but a lovely hostess soon spotted us and escorted us to a table with a bird's eye view of the Italian wood - fired oven. A charming unpretentious male server named Jeremy helped us with our selection of a 12 inch pizza. We selected the house made Fennel Sausage with mixed Kale, Reggiano & Rosemary from the select menu. These guys are using the best quality ingredients and that is reflected in the $22 price of our pizza. I chose a 12 oz glass of the Boneyard 'RPM' IPA on tap which Jeremy earnestly suggested was a very good tasting beer. We were very happy with our choice of this eatery already just sitting at our table admiring the well oiled activity of the servers and the female pizza chef. I had no idea how long they had been in business but this crew knew their stuff ! They make their pizzas on sourdough bases here so that was something new to look forward to and we LOVE great tasting wood - fired pizza. Jeremy brought waters to our table followed in quick succession by my glass of beer and then our lovely looking pizza. My ice cold IPA tasted spot on and we both loved the texture and rich flavor of our pizza. With the pizza totally gone it was time to examine the ice cream menu. I knew which one I wanted the moment we walked in the door.....Rum Raisin while my wife chose the Meadow Foam Honey with Hazelnut Toffee. A female server came by and took our order for the ice cream which she brought back to our table. What great service in this place ! Well my bowl of Rum Raisin ice cream ( just one scoop ) tasted out of this world. It was always my favorite flavor growing up in Australia but really hard to find anywhere in the USA.

I've tried \\"The Johnny\\", \\"The Blazin' Burger\\" and \\"The Thurmanator\\" - and everytime I've felt as if my hands and fingers met with Mr. Gooey on the first bite.  That's due, in part, because I order my burgers medium rare (all burgers at T.C. come medium well; all about size of the meat patty).  The other reason is T.C. buries their 3/4 Pounders with surprise sauces, tomatoes, and delicious add-ons.  Every beef pie sandwich will come to order and in a large portion.  Very cool.

Mine was served to me *without* pickles, which actually turned out to be a good thing because I think the burger was perfectly just with cheese, beef, and onions.  The pickles are housemade and thick, with LOTS of flavor.  I enjoyed them as if they were a chip on the side.  The fries were fine but I might try another side another time.  Hubby got the fish and chips, which he thought were pretty good.\\n\\nService was a little slow, but we weren't in a hurry and were also seated at the bar where folks were spaced out in the bar and on the patio, where it made it difficult for the bartender to quickly reach all the patrons.

While we have had more good times than bad times (see my previous review), there have been some experiences at this location that have been subpar.\\n\\nWe stopped in for a visit during Cinco de Mayo. While the restaurant is generally pretty clean and large, it was a little weird how empty the place was (especially during an NBA playoff game). \\n\\nWe sat down and were helped my a waitress who was either very new or just didn't know what she was doing. While we weren't in any type of rush and were just generally relaxing, her various mistakes with both food and drink (wrong drink, wrong wings, wrong size of wings, not paying attention to the table) would have been pretty annoying on most other nights. That plus the very very weak alcoholic drinks my wife ordered (I know it is I-Drive, but a martini shouldn't taste like water) killed a little bit of our buzz (I recommend sticking to beer at this place). Fortunately, the manager noticed these issues and gave us a little discount for our trouble. \\n\\nOverall, this isn't a bad spot to have some good wings and watch a game if you are on I-Drive.

My girlfriend's brother was visiting from Southeast Texas, so we were in the mood for a brunch buffet.  Little did we know of the horrors that awaited.\\n\\nWe arrived to an almost-packed parking lot, so we weren't hopeful of being seated anytime soon.  Much to our surprise, we were at a table within 2 minutes of walking in the door.  Every wall is adorned with televisions each displaying a live NFL game.  My girlfriend, a football fanatic, found the environment very much to her liking.  There were even neat little placards under every set displaying which teams would be shown on which LCD.  Overall, a well-organized setup that appeals to the sportsfan aesthetic.\\n\\nOkay, so we've been seated and taken in the ambience.  5 minutes pass.  10 minutes pass.  My hungry party begins to get impatient.  Girlfriend: \\"I think they forgot about us.  Can you go talk to the hostess?\\" I see multiple servers walking about, chatting happily around the hostess stand.  I see an increasingly frustrated girl in front of me.  The guest of honor is surfing his phone, so as far as he's concerned, the restaurant could be burning down.  Our waitress finally arrives 15 minutes after we've been seated.  She explains their peculier buffet system.\\n\\nWhat is the normal limiting factor at a buffet?  The capacity of the stomach?  The amount of food the kitchen can bring out?  Well, here, at the Park, it's the plates.  Your waitress/waiter must bring you a clean plate each time you wish to visit the buffet.  With the typical Austin restaurant waitstaff, that isn't a problem.\\n\\nThis past Sunday, I finally realized how it feels to be a lonely grandparent.  I constantly hoped against hope that out of the goodness in their hearts, that someone would come visit me.  Perhaps, to fill my empty water or to replace my plates.  10 minutes pass.  15 minutes pass.  Our first plates have been cleaned and collected by the extremely attentive dirty-dish-collector.  If I could've given all of my normally 20% tip (or more) to him, I would.  Finally our waitress returns and asks us if we want clean plates to revisit the buffet.  \\"Sure!\\" we reply.  \\"I'll be right back.\\"  10 minutes later, she returns with 2 plates and water refills.  Hopefully, you've been paying attention, because she wasn't.  We were a party of 3 and we needed 3 plates.  It would be another few minutes before she returned with the 3rd plate.\\n\\nThe entire reason we went to a Sunday brunch buffet is because we didn't want to wait for our food to be cooked and that we wanted to stuff our faces with delicious brunch foods.  We failed on both accounts.  We were only able to complete 2 plates of food after being in the restaurant for nearly 2 hours.  \\"A third plate for dessert?\\"  Sure, why not.  I wait the now-predictable 10-15 minutes for my third plate.  10 minutes pass and our waitress returns after having chatted up the nearby Saints fan.  \\"Did you want another plate?\\"  At this point, I was thorougly defeated.  \\"No, check please.\\"\\n\\nAs we were filling out our separate checks, my party and I looked at each other with befuddlement.  We were weighing 3 things.  1: Do we want to appear like cheapskates?  2: Do we want to discourage this terrible customer service?  3: Will we ever come back?  Just to fill in the complete story, we all tipped under 15%.\\n\\nIt's funny.  Normally you'd expect some mention of the quality of the food in a restaurant review.  However, the service stuck so far out in my mind, that the food was entirely forgettable.  Average, in my opinion, compared to the other offerings in Austin.\\n\\nWill I go back again?  Not with this experience in mind.  In fact, we were faced with finding a restaurant just tonight in the same area.

Actually, it's the first Vietnamese place I ever tried. It's relatively inexpensive, flavorful, and food comes out fast. \\"So, why the three stars?\\" you may ask. There are a few reasons. Pho Pasteur's food is A-OK, but it's not actively amazing. Also, it's just not that clean (your feet shouldn't stick to the floor in any restaurant, ever). And finally, the service lands everywhere on the spectrum. You're not here for frills! \\n\\nThere's a culture-wide argument over whether pho or bun bo hue is better. Personally, I like them both, and Pho Pasteur has good versions of both. There's a very generous amount of chicken in the pho ga (#24), and the meat is always tender in the pho tai (#22). Like many Americans, I'm not used to the texture of tendon or tripe, so I'm not a fan of their bo vien (meatballs) because of the gritty/fatty texture. I do, however, love their canh chua tom (#82) which is a spicy and sour clear soup with tail-on shrimp. Their bun thit heo nuong (#50 - grilled sliced pork with thin rice vermicelli noodles) and bun thit bo nuong (#52 - grilled sliced beef with thin rice vermicelli noodles) are good options, but bun is better around the corner at NDK. \\n\\nIn Vietnam, we regularly had to request water and napkins, both of which often had a cost. This isn't Vietnam, you shouldn't have to ask for those things here, but we always have to. Also, it's usually quite busy, so they expect you to order quickly, but then you can't get ahold of a server for the rest of the meal. \\n\\nOn the plus side, food always comes out right away, fresh and hot. And there are servers who have been working here for 20+ years, who are terrific. Also, a relatively recent review complained that Pho Pasteur doesn't take cards -- maybe the reviewer misunderstood the server, because they absolutely take Visa and MC. Perhaps they don't take AmEx or Discover, specifically. \\n\\nAnyway, we still go here from time to time because of nostalgia (or laziness), but I prefer NDK in Chinatown or Pho Hoa in the Dot."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The best.

Aaron, my BYFAD rep, reserved me a spot here towards the back. While I thought we were getting more space, the amount of space we had actually worked out just fine. A little tight for a group close to 40 people but we managed. \\n\\nWhile their drinks may be on the pricier side ($12) for a signature martini, they were delicious! And while off of Newbury Street, I don't know if I can justify the cost of a $12 martini on a normal day. However.... they were delicious and I wouldn't mind going back just for the martini's as that is what they are known for. On the other hand, my dear friend Ryan, spent over $100 on my drinks that night which consisted mostly of SoCo and coke. THAT I can not justify the cost of! Sorry but a handle of SoCo is about $20 - $30 depending on the size/proof you get. \\n\\nWhile their costs of their drinks and burgers ($5-8 each slider) are high, their entrees are actually moderately priced. I had ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken for dinner and it was like I had a party in my mouth! The combination of the wine and mushroom sauce with the chicken and the sauteed spinach just perfectly complimented one another. \\n\\nBased on the evening and the large amount of people in the crowd, I actually felt that our server did her best to serve all of us, especially when it not only was for drinks but also included food and people jumping around all over the place (well not literally). I have to say I was impressed that she was able to keep her cool. I'm sure she was probably in the back cursing us out but heck I don't blame her one bit if she did. \\n\\nSo let me raise my glass up to Match and say thank you for opening up your space and allowing me to have my 25th birthday party here.

We only had an hour before we had to be at the airport so I was worried we would run out of time. Although the line formed outside the door, the wait was maybe 10-15 minutes before we got to the front of the line. Here's how it works, stand in line, order, pay at the counter, get a table number, seat yourself and someone will bring you your food. \\n\\nRecommended is the Reggie which is the most popular/famous one on the menu. If you want an egg in it like the other Yelp pictures that would be the Reggie deluxe. It was relatively smaller than I pictured but it filled my boyfriend up (he ate some of my food though). He got it with the shiitake mushroom gravy rather than the heavier sausage gravy. The biscuits which this place is known for was more bread like and soft rather than the flaky exterior we were expecting. Still enjoyable. It had a piece of fried chicken, cheddar cheese, and bacon. Delicious but the chicken was on the drier side. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken pot pie. Wait time is 20 minutes. It has mushroom gravy and a biscuit crust. It was a bit bland (needs more salt) and had way too many vegetables. Thought it was a chicken pot pie and not a veggie pot pie? I liked that their chicken was cubed and crispy/fried rather than shredded. That is something different. I probably wouldn't order this again as it was all veggies.\\n\\nAlso ordered a side of biscuit and apple butter. Wanted something kind of sweet and was just worried my boyfriend would still be hungry. Not bad. Biscuit could be flakier but either apple butter or honey butter would be delicious with this.\\n\\nOverall the food was good but not amazing. I wouldn't wait an hour to eat here.

This was my second visit here, with my first being approximately two months ago.  I didn't review my first visit, but obviously I came back, so it must have been good.\\n\\nService was off the charts, all in a good way.  I walked myself into the bar area, and before I had even taken a seat I was greeted from behind the bar with a warm hello.  I didn't know it at the time, but the person greeting me was Ash, who I later learned to be the 'manager' (however I do note that he has also been referred to as the owner in previous reviews).  He was incredibly attentive and provided a warm and friendly introduction that day.  I asked for a beer, and within a minute I had a refreshing cold Grolsh in my hands.  I also asked him about a couple of menu items, and he took the time to explain how each was prepared, and offered his suggestions.  I ordered the Greek Wrap, with South West chicken soup as a side.\\n\\nThe soup was awesome, with a touch of heat to complement the flavour.  Ash mentioned that they don't serve this every day, but if it's being served the day you're there, I suggest you order it, assuming you like chicken, and a bit of heat!\\n\\nThe Greek Wrap was very good, with fresh ingredients and plenty of healthy stuffings.  The flavours were nicely blended.\\n\\nService:  Here's what I'm confused about, after reading previous reviews.  When I left the restaurant I said to myself that I HAD to take the time to write a review because the service was outstanding, and equally importantly, the entire staff was upbeat, attentive, and seemed to be having a great time.  Honestly, everyone from the bartender, to Ash, to the entire service staff seemed as though they had just been given a huge raise, as they all seemed so happy.  Personally, I had three different people attend to me for various things, and all were pleasant.  Obviously I hit a good day!\\n\\nAnd the kicker:  As I was leaving, I glanced around as I had wanted to say thanks to Ash for the service, but he was busy with other things behind the bar so I simply worked my way towards to the exit.  Literally as I was leaving, I heard \\"Thanks Marc, hope to see you again!\\".  (He had asked my name earlier, when I had ordered my beer.)  I turned around and there was Ash, still behind the bar, just wanted to say goodbye.  Exemplary management.\\n\\nThere you go.  My two cents worth.

But the food is real lobster and crab so I understand why it was higher in price. I just felt like there could've been more lobster meat on both sandwiches for the price it is. The lobster roll was about $17 but they price it at market price. The lobster grilled cheese was about $15. Their chips are made in house but were like tortilla chips. I think they may be better if they were like house made potato chips, but they were still pretty good with their salsa. The bread on the lobster grilled cheese was burned so it deterred from the taste of the sandwich but I bet it would've been superb lol. My daughter got the kids meal with the hamburger which was pretty tasty. I will say that I also would've liked to see more selections other than seafood just for those who might not want seafood or for kids meals, but then again, who goes to a place like this and wouldn't order something with lobster or seafood in it?  fyi - They also have selections that can be fried or grilled.

The food and service used to he great. 6 months ago, I would have given this place a rave review. Sadly, I can't d that now. \\n\\nThe tl;dr is: It's under new management and the quality of food and service has suffered greatly. It isn't the same. It isn't even an acceptable level of different. I'll outline both of my visits post new management below. \\n\\n On my first visit to Yakitori Jinbei under new management, I was part of a party of 5. I was not greeted when I came in, and waited several minutes to be seated even though they weren't very busy. Throughout the entire time our water was not refilled and we were never checked on. I peeked into the kitchen to alert them that we were here, and we were finally seated. We ordered, but noticed that there was no silverware. No one came out in 15 minutes, so I eventually grabbed my owl silverware from the stand where the wait staff usually got it from. I ordered tonkotsu ramen with extra chashu, and requested that my egg be hard boiled instead of soft boiled. The waiter told me when I ordered that the egg would take an extra few minutes, which was perfectly understandable and acceptable. Our food came quite a bit (half an hour) later, minus my bowl. The waiter put down a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with a soft boiled egg and no extra chashu, which was what my friend had ordered, not me. I pass the bowl over to my friend. Another half hour passes and my food still isn't out. At this point, I figure that there's no way it could take 30 minutesto boil an egg, so I ask if my food is coming. At this point, the waiter is puzzled, and says that he brought us our food. I tell him no, that he has not. He told me that he placed a bowl of ramen in front of me. I informed him that he did, but it wasn't my ramen, as it didn't have any of my special requests, but was instead the ramen that my friend ordered. He tells me that he misunderstood my friend's order and that he thought she was splitting a bowl of ramen with the person next to me, as that was mentioned at one point. He said that the ramen he put in front of me was in fact for me. It's an easy enough mistake to make, but even if that had been the case, the ramen placed in front of me was not at all made to my specifications. There was no hard boiled egg nor extra chashu. He brought out my bowl later and was apologetic. The food was just as good as ever, and I received 6 pieces of chashu in my bowl (this is relevant for the second visit). I know that servers are just humans like the rest of us, so I was a bit annoyed but not angry. After all, he was the only server working that night so we figured he was just overwhelmed. End first visit.\\n\\n\\nCue the second visit 8 days later. Once again, we were not greeted and had to wait to be seated despite the fact that the  restaurant wasn't busy. Whatever, though. I came for ramen, not to make friends with the wait staff. Of course good service is nice, but as long as the food is good I'll return. I order the tonkotsu ramen again, again with extra chashu. Our food takes 30 minutes to arrive, and this time there are only 3 pieces of chashu in the bowl (remember how I got 6 last time?) I inform the waiter of this (the same man as last time), and he says that the order of extra chashu entitles you to one extra piece of chashu. Sounds inconsistent based on my visit from last time, but okay. I go to eat the noodles, and they're...sweet? I don't know how they managed to mess up noodles, but I'm certainly not going to pay for bad service AND bad noodles. I push it to the side of the table and wait for someone to come by so I can tell them what's going on. No one does for about 15 minutes. Eventually one of the wait staff notices (they had more than one person working on this night) and I tell her the problem. She goes to get our waiter, whom I've been led to believe is the new manager. I tell him that the noodles are sweet, that I've been to this restaurant many times, just as recently as last week, and that the noodles don't taste right. He says \\"well this is how we make them\\". At this point, I'm not gonna argue with him. If he wants to run his new restaurant into the ground then he can be my guest. I just want to leave. He asks what I'd like to do and I tell him that I'd like to send the noodles back, and he hesitates for a moment, but eventually agrees to take the noodles back to the kitchen and off of our bill. I left after that. I won't be returning. There's another ramen place opening in Atlanta in 2 weeks.

I feel like i'm being generous giving up 2 stars.  I've lived in cbus most of my life and have been to Thurman's before you actually had to wait to get a seat on a Tuesday night.  Hadn't been in a long time so we went the other day and it reminded me of why I never found it memorable.  Simply put, the burger is just not that good.  The meat is flavorless and bland (I don't think it was even seasoned), the cheese on my Thurman burger was not even melted and the mushrooms are straight out of a can and were still cold...Blech.  I left over half of it on my plate.  \\n\\nI firmly believe I was the victim of a cook that just didn't give a shit that night because I have had better burgers here.  Still, Thurman's on its best day does not compare to an actual great burger.  I'll take a double 185 with cheese over a Thurman burger any day of the week and twice on Sundays...and I wouldn't have to wait for it either.  The fries were fucking disgusting.  They were still raw and they actually served them.  They are cut way too big...try taking a hint from the dozens of other places that serve fresh cut fries and are actually successful at it.  If you have never been to Thurman's I encourage you to at least try it if you can stand the ridiculous wait. Hopefully your burger is better than mine...but it probably won't be.  With so many great restaurants in our town it's sad that this is the place people talk about in Columbus.   I don't know... maybe fame has gone to their head here because I did not enjoy my meal at all...actually now that I think about it, it really sucked balls.  \\n\\nUnless I'm dragged there by out of town visitors I will not return for a long long time.

I decided to try it after getting back from holidays out of town and not having anything to make for lunch. \\n\\nThai food has been a very hit/miss experience for me. Having experienced some very authentic Thai cuisine I feel like a lot of the offerings that Americans come to associate with Thai are dumbed down, not very flavorful, or very muted compared to the actual authentic dishes. I always get the same thing the first time I got to a new Thai place - Tom Kah soup and Pad Thai. This gives me a pretty good idea as to the type of establishment I'm eating at and helps me baseline my experience if I choose to get a little more \\"adventurous\\" in later visits. \\n\\nThe Pad Thai tasted fresh, the noodles still had a bit of \\"chew\\" to them and were not a ball of mush. It did not have a bunch of oil added to the dish creating an \\"oil-slick\\" in my mouth. The added spice (requested 4/5 heat) was basic, adding flavor and heat without being overbearing. There were no sprouts in the dish but it did have the scallions/green onions and egg which are basic parts of the dish. The shrimp (which I chose among a bunch of different protein options) were plump, fresh, and perfectly cooked. While there were not a ton of them (4 large-jumbo to be exact), it added to the sauce used to cook the noodles and I'd rather have fewer higher quality shrimp than a bunch of lower quality to seem like more is better. Was it the best or my favorite Pad Thai? No, but it also was nowhere near the worst I've had either. It is pretty much smack in the middle of my spectrum of experience at about 2/3 the price of what I normally pay for such a dish which is a great value in my mind. \\n\\nThe Tom Kah experience was better but similar in the spectrum of the various types I have had over the years. It brings that same creamy, spicy, and tangy profile with a good amount of mushrooms and chicken (or veggies if you aren't a meat fan). The spice used was your basic chili peppers and not overbearing, but once you get to the bottom there can be a deposit of them which if you take in the last gulp can give you a pretty good sweat at the end of the dish (I again did 4/5 spice level). The chicken was not overcooked and the mushrooms still had their integrity and meatiness intact which can be a little more difficult for soups unless they are added at the end of the process. \\n\\nI'm kind of perplexed by the negative reviews... and maybe that is just an expectation versus experience consideration on their part. However, what this place offers is great value, convenience (for me at least), and quality food. While it is not my favorite Thai in the area, for the price and convenience it offers it is a great option for a quick lunch or cheap dinner. It'll be put in the rotation for me whenever I am grabbing lunch (which is not very frequent) during the work week."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place has been on our list to try since we saw Man Vs.

I love that the interior hasn't changed one bit since the day it opened decades ago.  It's right out of 1970's Nashville.

The steaks are limited to a ribeye, two different sizes of strip, two different sizes of filet, a t-bone and a 32 ounce Porterhouse.  They are char-grilled as opposed to broiled which does add a different flavor profile.  Most importantly they train their grill cooks right.  I have never nor have I ever heard of anyone sending their steak back because the cooking temperature was wrong.   I've never seen it happen at any table around us when were there.  I cannot say this for any other steakhouse I've ever been to at any price.  That's some mighty fine focus on what counts if you ask me.

The pricing is very fair for seafood and the Taste of Maine is actually super reasonable, may I say cheap for the amount of food you get. But I wish for what I pay I would enjoy my food more.\\n\\nIn my personal opinion, the 3 different rolls tasted the same. I am not a fan of their \\"secret seasoning\\". It -looks like- it's very light on seasoning since you don't see a lot of butter or mayo that other lobster roll places would use but for me the seasoning is overpowering. I'm pretty sure it's the cumin that I am not into. Is cumin typical with seafood pairing? I guess so. Do I dabble in a little cumin now and then? Yes I do, but I am not into this. Let my lobster shine! I can't even compare how the lobster v crab v shrimp taste since they taste the damn same to me here and it's a shame.\\n\\nThe lobster bisque is pretty good, not the best, but after not enjoying my lobster roll, it's a nice comfort. \\n\\nAs stated before, my favorite part have to the the crab claw. It's so fresh, the crab flavor is not inhibited in anyway. A little cocktail sauce just for fun but the crab claw sings it's own song and it's just so good. If this was a review for just crab claw, I would have given it a solid 4.5 star. But sadly with Lobster in the name, I expected more. I wanted more, I am greedy and I love my lobster and I wanted to love this too.\\n\\nI guess they're going pretty strong with more location opening, so I'm not hating at all.

Our table of 6 ordered the prime rib ($48), tajarin pasta ($32), pork chop ($38), pappardelle pasta ($31), lemon risotto ($25), and salmon ($35). I personally tasted the risotto and salmon.\\n\\nI'll start by saying that I have never been so at odds with a dish as when I first tasted the risotto. Though I liked that it was cooked well, the taste and smell was completely nauseating; every bite of it tasted like gorgonzola cheese and literally no other flavor was present. The soft shell crab was great, but the main portion of the dish was virtually inedible. I had to switch plates with my fianc√©e, and fortunately she was more understanding than I. The salmon, while certainly more edible and actually very decent, was over cooked. The skin was crispy, however, and the mashed potatoes and lima bean accompaniment were tasty. Still, the fish was leagues better than the risotto. I truly cannot wrap my mind around it, and everyone at the table agreed.\\n\\nThe pappardelle pasta was serviceable and came with lamb in a meaty sauce. I'm told that it was okay -- nothing amazing, but definitely not bad. I also heard great things about the porkchop so I would recommend that. The prime rib also received very solid feedback.\\n\\nAll in all I was severely disappointed in the evening. Service was generally very poor -- we saw the waitress maybe three times throughout the meal, and in intervals of what felt like twenty minutes.

The menu is still a mix of 50s & 60s era dishes like beef stroganoff, oysters Rockefeller, and King Louie salad, with some new offerings like a kale & apple salad and Ahi poke. Prime Rib is still the name of the game and it shows up everywhere: as prime tidbits with horseradish sauce during HH, in a French dip sandwich, as a cold sandwich, and of course as the star of dinner served with mashed potatoes and veggies. \\n\\nThere are plenty of seafood, salad and chicken options for those not into prime rib, but we were definitely there for the dry aged prime. It did not disappoint. The very thick slice was cooked perfectly medium rare, and was oh, so flavorful. The mashed potatoes with au jus (we requested) were on point as well. Veggies over cooked. \\n\\nThe atmosphere and decor remains the exact same but feels cleaner, even has a scent of bleach, but in a good way. The restaurant is still dark with circular booths but there is now a patio out front so you can enjoy your meal in bright sunshine, a first! \\n\\nThe lounge is just as it's always been, red walls and half circle red leather banquets that shout 50s Mafia or Tony Soprano. There are several wooden tables and chairs plus stools around the bar too. There are 4 video poker machines on the side of the bar. Seriously. \\n\\nThe improved food quality is most important; second is Clyde's now has live music every single night, not just weekends. They post the calendar on their website and the list of Jazz, R&B and Blues bands is impressive. Music starts at 9 and goes until 12:00-12:30. When the band finishes, the people all disappear instantaneously. Poof, like a magic act. Everyone in the lounge, gone. I always wonder where they go? Years ago the crowd would magically appear in mass at The Candlelight. But now...I think most are there for the music, drinking water, so when the music is done, so are they. \\n\\nWe went to see the Norman Sylvester Band last night and they are fantastic. Saw them at the Mississippi Street Fair several times and I now seek them out, they are that good. They  perform at Clyde's on the last Friday of the month and draw a fun crowd. Last night they played their rendition of Bruno Mars Uptown Funk and had everyone on their feet. \\n\\nThe crowd is diverse: all ages, races, dancing skills! Lots of plaid, lots of hats. Some look like they could have been extras on a 70s sitcom. All good, all fun. \\n\\nI used to go to Clyde's a few times a year but when it morphed into a characetuer of itself, I stopped coming.

They came hardly sauced and I had to ask for more buffalo sauce on the side.\\n\\nMargarita Pizza: Tasted exactly the same. The bartenders were confused whether the pizza came with a balsamic drizzle. One said it did, but when the pizza came out the balsamic was missing. When I went back up to the bar another bartender said it didn't.\\n\\nThe fries tasted EXACTLY the same and were the same price.\\n \\n* New Item: Philly Cheesesteak: This was good. The meat was cooked well, but with a price tag of $14.25 I'll hit up Laspada's instead.\\n\\nThere's no reason to frequent a place with higher prices for food which tastes the same or has declined.

I'm a little biased since I'm not a huge mustard person so take that with a grain of salt. The bread was perfectly toasted and buttered so it held up well with the fillings. We ended up subbing the duck fat fries for an additional $3 to taste them and they were OK. I haven't had the regular fries so I can't speak to the difference but duck fat fries tend to have a bit more flavor in my opinion.\\n\\n+ Steelhead with mushroom risotto & pesto - This was a nice cleaner meal option to order. They give you a HUGE order of salmon with the entree on a bed of half risotto/half pesto with a caprese salad. The salmon was grilled perfectly and not overcooked. Can't go wrong with a caprese salad in my eyes since anything with mozzarella is a winner in my book. The risotto was a little runny for my taste but pesto was a nice flavor contrast. \\n\\nOverall, food here is pretty decent but I can't say both entrees blew me out of the water. Service here was attentive but not super chatty if you're into that. PCG is a Portland staple so it's going to be worth it to check it out and enjoy the view."},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Y'all -- Barcelona is BACK. \\n\\nOkay, maybe Barcelona never really went anywhere; maybe it was me? Let me explain... When I first moved to Cbus over 10 years ago, Barcelona was *the* place to go.  And maybe this was just in my head, but I started to lump it together with some of the other original \\"fancy\\" spots that never seemed to evolve or keep up with all the exciting and delicious things happening in the Columbus food scene. \\n\\nWhether it was my imagination or not -- I stayed away for several years.\\n\\nBut recently a German Village friend told me how wonderful his most recent experience had been... I was intrigued. Fast forward a couple of months and a friend's uni graduation was the perfect excuse to re-try this old favorite. \\n\\nIT WAS PERFECT.\\n\\nSeriously, it was one of the most perfect dining experiences I've had in my 10+ years in the city. The three big wins for me were: service, ambiance, and of course -- the food. \\n\\n*Service*\\n\\nFrom the minute we walked in, the service was spectacular. It's exactly the style I love -- technically perfect, but still warm and friendly. All the staff we saw seemed to be genuinely having a good time and enjoying themselves. Our particular server, Layla, was one of the loveliest I've ever had. She was kind, funny, and confident, and she never left us wanting for anything. She made awesome recommendations and actually gave AF about my wheat allergy, easily navigating me through which menu items I could have. (And it was a ton!)\\n\\n*Ambiance*\\n\\nOne thing that's never changed at Barcelona is how beautiful it is. It's dark and romantic with the wood and bricks everywhere, and don't even get me started on the gorgeous patio. But that patio is no secret -- everyone knows it's the best in the city.\\n\\n*Food*\\n\\nI've always thought the menu here was a little seafood heavy... and I totally get it... Barcelona is coastal... This time, though, I felt like there were so many more non-seafood options! Not that I don't like it; I'm just super picky. \\n\\nThe current menu is glorious and should please just about anybody and any food restrictions/preferences. There's a perfectly-curated list of sausages and cheeses, which I 100% recommend. Nom nom nom. Then there are the tapas -- so many delicious choices! Olives, goat cheese-stuffed avocados, braised short rib, patatas bravas, sauteed shrimp, etc. And of course all the different paella options! We had the short rib and scallop paella, and it was EVERYTHING.\\n\\nWhen it comes to dessert, Barcelona is one of the few Columbus spots who still takes pastries seriously. This is one place you *don't* want to skip it, trust me. They even make an almond cake that just so happens to also be gluten-free! It was perfect even for my gluten-loving friends. \\n\\n*In the end*\\n\\nI'm so excited that Barcelona found its mojo. But then again, maybe I was the one who was lost... Either way, I'm thrilled for both of us. I can't wait to share more special meals here!"},{"name":"Maitland Breakfast Club","address":"745 Orienta Ave","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4","text":"This place is great.

My significant other and I waited OVER AN HOUR for a seat only to be told that we weren't on the waitlist and then after further research discovered we were on the \\"old list\\" and supposedly contacted with no answer. Absolutely ridiculous and incompetent service. A wrinkled up piece of paper was obviously not a sophisticated enough system for the hostess to keep track of the waitlist and actually contact the appropriate numbers. \\n\\nUpon review, the phone number was correct, she just never bothered to actually contact us as promised. We met several people outside complaining about similar experiences. I'd rather be at Pearl Oyster bar in New York than this knockoff. At least when I wait an hour there, I know I'll actually be seated and enjoy an amazing clam chowder and lobster roll. \\n\\nAfter being told we would be seated next, we waited outside again for another twenty minutes and realized this hostess was obviously not going to seat us unless we waited inside where there was no way for her to avoid us. Amazingly, we were then called.\\n\\nWe were finally seated in the middle of an empty six person table and served water... only to be asked to MOVE a few minutes later. At this point the service was laughable and we had put up with such incompetence we figured the food must be their saving grace.

Didn't taste bad, just overhyped. Would probably warn against coming here, just because there are so many better options (but again, the food is not bad).\\n\\nSo this is a little food truck with a lot of outdoor seating. The service is fast and pretty friendly. Even though they told us the food would take 20 minutes to prepare, it came out relatively quickly (~10 mins), so that was a plus.\\n\\nThe food itself was not stellar. I came with a friend and we got: roasted beets, carbonara, and cacio e pepe (without the pepper because my friend is a picky eater lol). The great thing was that they complied with the no pepper request (esp considering it's cacio e pepe lol).\\n\\nThe roasted beets just tasted how you would expect. The cheese that came with it was very mild, and didn't really add to the dish. Over all, not bad, but also not special in any way. Price was reasonable given the taste!\\n\\nThe pastas were both super salty. You can also tell that the pasta is made in-house, and not greatly. The pieces of the pasta were all SUPER short (like would've-had-more-success-eating-with-a-spoon short), which made me think that they either are not great at making pasta, or they just threw in the scraps left over after cooking the longer pieces. Nbd, but the taste of the pasta was also not outstanding. The carbonara was super greasy and the taste of the sauce was too heavily pancetta and not enough cheese/egg. The cacio e pepe was especially salty, to the point where it was hard to finish. Neither of the pastas had that silky finish to the sauce you normally would expect. Pretty disappointing in that regard.\\n\\nOver all, this place is just eh. Food doesn't taste bad, but over all quality falls below expectations (too salty, too greasy, pasta is not great). Given that there are so many better options, I would not recommend.

First, my wife stopped coming so I would make a special trip to get her something if I was getting Pepino's. I then noticed a difference in how my food was being made. I was turned-off to a couple of things I had purchased before but shrugged it off, telling myself that my \\"El Cheapo\\" would remain the everlasting standby, impervious to any changes they could make. But even that, somehow, has been ruined. Hard to put my finger on it but I've ordered it now three times tasting \\"different.\\" They won't put on as much sour cream when I pay over $1 for \\"extra.\\" They stopped giving me as many chips also, until today, when they told me chips that no chips came with my dish. Besides this being the first I'd ever heard of chips NOT coming with a dish at Pepino's, I wasn't told of this fact before hand. Before I ordered and walked away with the line doubling behind me. \\n\\nI've been trying to eat this baja bowl but it is inedible... I've wasted $10 on something that tastes worse than Taco Bell. When I paid for a small drink, the cashier gave me a water cup. Chipotle's bowls are ten times better, plus cheaper. I just wish we had some more in close-in PDX, so independent mom and pop establishments couldn't just take everyone's business for granted. Let's see, we have some rice and beans plus two kinds of cheeses. I added steak for 3.50, which tastes horrible, and I added lettuce, which retrospectively was a huge mistake. \\n\\nMonths ago, I would have complained that Pepino's seemed under-staffed. Now it seems like every time I go into the Hawthorne location, I'm dealing with someone new while someone else that's new makes the food. The last three times I've been, I've had dismal experiences and find it hard to find an excuse to go back.

On the one hand, I love, love, LOVE some of their pizzas.  The crust is baked perfectly.  It's chewy and crispy at the same time.  Not, as I've heard some people complain, undercooked.  It doesn't have that golden brown look of other crusts, sometimes, but it's definitely cooked to the right level.\\n\\nI like the non-red sauce pizzas infinitely more than the red-sauced ones, though they're all good.  Their version of a meat-lovers option is pretty heavy on salt, and as a result of all the meat, much greasier than the other options (which are not generally very greasy at all).  Haven't tried the salads or the dessert pizzas, but I'm sure they're good, too.\\n\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it takes a REALLY long damn time to get a pizza, even though the place is not moving fast.  Other people here have griped about hour long waits, (despite, near as I can tell, sometimes as many as 5 people in the kitchen, some of whom may or may not be counter staff).  Add me to the list.\\n\\nAnd while the service is friendly, it's also often nearly nonexistent.  The decision to not have refillable fountain drinks means that if I buy a soda and drink it up while waiting that sometimes interminable length of time, I have to buy another bottle of soda or switch to water.  I'm really not happy about that.  And if I get water, and drink it up, either during my meal or while I'm waiting, I have on several occasions ended up simply walking to the counter and filling it myself from the pitchers sitting around there, because NOBODY SEEMS TO BE AROUND TO DO THAT.  What are they going to do when they start offering beer?\\n\\nI'll take that from a relaxed bar like the Gulu.  But not a frigging pizza joint.  Really hope they shape up, because they're offering something totally different than the legion of Greek pizza shops that serve Salem, and a much better experience than the Upper Crust (at the very least in that they aren't treating their employees like literal slave labor)."},{"name":"Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld","address":"6677 Sea Harbor Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment!

A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.\\n\\nNext, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.\\n\\nThe food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.\\n\\nLastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door?

I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \\"too late.\\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen.

The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service.\\n\\nI hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. \\n\\nTried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! \\n\\nOverall really good food and service.

The restaurant is gay owned and operated, and definitely is a staple of gay Atlanta, so it is well worth mentioning.

We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a/c not working so well, I didn't like the size/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.\\n\\nShould I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.\\n\\nPeabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out.

My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \\n\\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \\n\\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \\n\\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \\n\\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\\n\\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \\n\\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \\n\\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\\n\\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place.

The plus is when one happens to magically choose the \\"freshest\\" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily.   I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing  flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite.   On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good.  If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins,  and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared.   The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon.\\n\\nOur consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and  the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall.

Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.

Good, light sauce and healthy but flavorful feel overall.\\n\\nOne friend had the gemelli with shrimp and scallops which actually sounded like the best thing on the menu but was slightly disappointing to me. The sauce was a brandy-gorgonzola, which was GOOD and quite unique but a little watery for the dish.

Let me say, though, that when I come here now, I don't come here for the sushi. I'll say right off that bat- don't have the rolls. Even for the price, they are not worth it. They are obviously pre-made and refrigerated, and they're probably not what you're in the mood for anyway (you won't find anything fresh-made, nothing hot, nothing deep-fried, nothing fusion- just the basic regulars, pre-made and retrieved from the fridge when you order it). Back when I first started coming to Banzai I only ate nigiri, so I didn't know how bad the rolls were. Don't get me wrong, they won't give you food poisoning or anything- they're just not good. The nigiri, though, is decent, if a bit over-priced for the portions. It's great for a quick bite though- the service is decent and fast and the servers are friendly. I also LOVE their bento boxes- they're a really good deal and delicious, especially the salmon one. You can also get an assortment of those Japanese fad drinks, which I like because you can't get those at most other sushi places. The tonkatsu is also good- with pork the way I like it, as opposed to with chicken the way it's offered at almost every other Japanese place in Austin. The lunch specials are okay- they give me the same pre-made and thawed impression I get from the rolls, but they aren't bad tasting, although the portions are a little small. Overall the place is decent. Not worth going out of your way for, but if you know to avoid the rolls you won't leave unhappy."},{"name":"The Storm Crow Tavern","address":"1305 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The Storm Crow is a gem. It has come a long way since it first opened its doors, particularly the food. The menu has a good hearty selection at decent prices. The original $5 menu was enticing but a little off the mark with the quantity and quality. However, that being said the revamped menu has a wider array of delicious options. For example the Elvish Veggie Burger, Chickpea Fries, and Nachos Supreme. I am a vegetarian, and the veggie burger was so good. Also, the chickpea fries were so awesome, definitely recommend them.\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my favourite spots to game, that is board game! The array of games is quite the feat. My favourite is Apples 2 Apple and Cards Against Humanity , but I am expanding my horizons. I am pretty sure they have most games your looking for!\\n\\nLast but not least, the ambience of this place is probably what it is best known for. A fantastical homage to everything fantasy.

Most recently, we unknowingly walked in 5 minutes before close (which is 9pm, FYI), and still received the same friendly greeting. We offered to leave, but they insisted we stay and even fired up a few things so we could get everything we ordered. They were patient, personable, and showed no sign of frustration or disappointment.

Two, the dining room was very large and quite noisy, even at 8:00 at night.  Still not a deal breaker. My main issue was with the ambiance.  With a restaurant called The Wave, with a waiting area that is all lit up in ocean blue, it was very confusing to have an orange and gold, retro vibe throughout.  Kind of confusing.

We finally chased down a manager to find our checks and she said she would do me a favor and remove the pizza. I pointed out I had never received a pizza and she told me I had. The entire interaction was baffling. It took about another half an hour to get a check for the one drink I had, which the manager then decided to comp. They did also offer a free play card, which I declined as I needed to leave and eat, and didn't care to ever return. I really wanted my 3 hours back more than the free drink or arcade time. I was utterly starving at that point so I left and went to the Chipotle up the street, 3 hours after I had sat down to eat at Main Event.

It was however early and empty enough that I was wondering why we weren't seated elsewhere.\\n\\nWhen I first sat down I thought the beer menu was the regular menu, it's that big. The menu for food is something that just fits on your placemat, but the beer menu has pages upon pages of drinks. The guys got beers, while I got an Ice Box which tasted more like an iced coffee than anything alcoholic, and my cousin got Peach Bellini which she also enjoyed.\\n\\nAlthough I really enjoyed my drink I found my food average. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Breakfast Club. I loved the tater tots, those were delicious, but I found the sandwich itself kind of clunky and dry. The chicken breast wasn't heavily battered, so it tasted more like a slightly floured piece of chicken as opposed to the crunchy \\"KFC style chicken\\" I'd been expecting. The egg was also overcooked, although I probably should've asked for over easy. But basically there were two layers of the sandwich, or three pieces of waffle bread. I thought there would be a tomato or something else with moisture in it since the egg wasn't runny, but no. Because of this I found the sandwich very difficult to eat, I had to drench the entire thing with all of the maple syrup I was given and that still wasn't enough.\\n\\nMy family seemed fine with their choices, and I actually had a pretty good time here despite the mediocre sandwich.

It could stand to have more lemony flavor, but as an iced tea, it's very good. I'm slightly less enamored with the punch they offer -- it's decent enough to buy, but it's missing something.

For those of you that are unfamiliar with the DDP it is a prepaid dining package that you can purchase if you are staying in a Walt Disney World resort. Essentially you pay for your meals in advance and if you are a crafty diner -like me- you can really get a lot of bang for your buck and end up saving some money in the long run. So take my review with a grain of salt because I went BIG at Artist Point and did so without regret. \\n\\nOf all the WDW eateries Artist Point is firmly entrenched in my top three. Artist Point gets huge bonus points for featuring an extensive wine selection from the under appreciated Pacific Northwest. I'm a pushover when it comes to a good wine pairing and always ask my server to match a glass to each course. Since they are trained in this and I am not I leave it to the professionals. \\n\\nI am a big fan of the artisan cheese course and like a typical American I treat this as an appetizer instead of an end of the meal treat. The trio of cheeses covers a safe yet broad selection of fromage including a nice cheddar, a creamy goat and a tangy blue. This was matched nicely with an Oregon Pinot Noir. \\n\\nThere are two dishes Artist Point is famous for; the cedar plank salmon and the buffalo. Choosing between these two wonderful dishes is almost a Sophie's Choice caliber decision. Of course if you know that Artist Point has an off the menu surf and turf option where you can have both you won't have to decide. It's kind of like getting your burger \\"animal style\\" at In-N-Out because unless you know to ask for it you wouldn't know it is there. Both dishes are wonderful and served in smaller portions when combined so you can enjoy both without being wasteful. \\n\\nDesserts leave a little to be desired at Artist Point. The signature berry cobbler just doesn't do it for me. The chocolate cheesecake and the clafouti (a rustic baked custard pie with fruit) are better choices.\\n\\nArtist Point is a popular restaurant so make sure yu contact Disney Dining for a priority seating time."},{"name":"Miel Brasserie","address":"510 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I cheated and ate here for lunch on restaurant week.

Elbow out the meat eaters or come early. Bring the dogs. Almost all the menu items are adaptable to vegan without compromise. For example they have vegan cheese and avocado so when you veganize an item you don't give up several essential toppings and pay the same price as omnis. At breakfast the \\"how latin\\" is the major winner, with tofu and vegan sausage, wonderful but oiley sauce, black bean mango salsa, extra toast because the biscuit is not vegan, and vegan cheese grits. At $9 is also among the best values in portland. No more nickle and diming vegans to sub cheaper ingredients that their carnivorous counterparts. Don't forget about dinner, they have a happy hour where you can get a vegan quesadilla or tacos for $4 and a beer for $3.  This place trumps vita for vegan alberta st breakfast, and is the winner for vegan dinner on the street as well. Don't sleep in and get slammed with a wait with all the omnis, go early and bring your dogs, it will be a great experience.  They open at 7am and there is never a wait till about 8:30ish.

This one I must say was pretty bad. We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. \\n\\nOur server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.\\n\\nAfter we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.\\n\\nAfter waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. \\n\\nAfter another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.\\n\\nWithin the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.\\n\\nShe ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock.

Oh and did I mention the liberal sweet sweet mustard sauce that was all over this thing!\\n\\nI picked up the sandwich and the bun was soaking in it, inside and out, I could not taste anything else but the sauce.\\n\\nNo where on the menu did it say anything about that sauce, and the server never asked me what I wanted or did not want on my sandwich.\\n\\nAnd the final slap on the face, the two guys running the kitchen never even bothered to come out of the kitchen, it was too much for one of them to take my order at the front counter.\\n\\nThe same guy who made my food also passed my the debit terminal without cleaning his hands or wearing any gloves.\\n\\nSomeone needs to learn some food safe and customer service."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We give it a DAVLIN rating of 23-Food 25-Decor 22-Service  (0-30 possible score)\\n\\nUpdated review: just went there a second time. Not good. Don't go here on hot days!!! Their Air Conditioning is NOT sufficient to cool inside, it was miserable and they had all windows closed and manager (she) refused to open windows early evening when it was windy outside and cooler than inside!! Scratching my head in that decision. Carne Asada Fajitas were great but flour tortillas in enchiladas are like 'Rubber' very disappointing and it was the same comment from two different people other than myself! \\n\\nWell after reading some of the negatives it reminded me that bad news travels fast and good news travels slow. If you're reading this you should remember to read between the lines and differentiate if you can, who's being accurate and who is not worth listening to. \\n\\nThe other reviews made me realize that there are a lot of people who live around here that have no concept of attending an adult restaurant. I always scratched my head why some parents bring children to restaurants that are clearly for adults when they SHOULD be taking their children to Denny's or some other 'family' restaurant! The last thing people want to do is to go to a very nice place and listen to annoying children being loud!!!! Or worse, a baby crying! \\n\\nThe fact is this is an obvious restaurant geared for adults. Our kind of place. The first compliment I want to give is to the ambience.  It is fantastic--from the decor to the very large windows that open to the street on both sides of the building. The staff was very friendly and down to earth. Prices were inexpensive, I think they should raise their prices! This would help keep a more high end clientele. In viewing the menu I knew the food was going to be good just based on their flavorings and descriptions. 95% of all Mexican restaurants make generic Mexican food! Yes, that food is good as well but, once in awhile you will come across a rare find. The only other upscale Mexican restaurant I have found is Javier's in Newport Beach, CA. \\nAt Matador, the food was good. I like how you can choose a traditional dish but then they have variety of flavors and spices from which to choose for the preparation. The Queso was just ok, it's more of a bean dip with some cheese. They need to reverse it and have less bean dip and a lot more queso. With the Street Tacos they should allow you to pick what meat you want inside. Here they give you 5 tacos, each with a different meat and flavor. We found we preferred 2 of the 5. Chips and salsa were good. Salsa could be a bit more spicy. But the way they make it will allow more people to enjoy it. I would recommend having 2 salsas and let the customer get what they want. I like spicy, my wife doesn't.  The best plate I had was the Spicy Mexican Shrimp with habanero sauce and a Jalape√±o Corn Bread. This plate was amazing! At the end of the day I told my wife, \\"Why would we go to any other Mexican place when we can come here for the ambience?\\" Most people take pics of the food. To me it's all about the atmosphere. \\n\\nWe just moved to The Pearl and have not been to another Mexican restaurant in Portland prior to The Matador. No need for us to look any further!\\n\\nWe'd like to thank Corah our server. We enjoyed her company, very friendly and knowledgable."},{"name":"Hyatt Regency Orlando","address":"9801 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This Hotel is amazing.

The streams have fallen and the quality is horrible. They could have easily prepared and actually payed for a quality stream, for example the dedicated Bein Sports 3 stream that was showing the game, rather than trying to cut corners with free but bad internet streams. The management was not prepared at all for this event and there were not enough seats as well. I had to sit on the floor. If I could give 0 stars, I would. I would not recommend coming to an establishment that would cut corners in-spite of obvious profits, which hurts its own clientele, and that would so sloppily prepare for such a big event that could further its name and business.

There was already a long line going down the sidewalk and if we had arrived any later, we may had to have waited to get a table. When the restaurant doors opened, Vikram Vij himself, the owner of the restaurant, greeted everyone individually as they walked in. He also would stop by our table a couple times throughout the meal to ask us what we thought of the food.\\n\\nMy favorite part of the meal occurred even before my table ordered any food. The servers stop by the table with a tray of goodies where one could just grab a piece to eat in a single bite. Each one is flavorful in spices in its own unique way and they really do end up whetting the appetite. One of these things they bring to the table is their chai tea which was particularly excellent.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered a bunch of dishes which included samosas, eggplant curry, mutton kebab, and much more. What I loved about each of their curry dishes is that the sauces are different for each one and are quite distinct from one another. Three of the more memorable dishes for me are their lamb popsicles, portobello mushroom curry, and spicy goat curry. The lamb is super tender and has it's signature gamey taste laid atop a pool of yellow curry which was my favorite sauce amongst all the dishes. The portobello mushroom curry includes a thicker and creamier curry sauce with meaty and hearty mushrooms that were cooked perfectly. The spicy goat curry was great in that.. well... unlike the other sauces, this one had a nice spicy kick to it.

The ambience seem nice with the tasteful decor, with good comfortable seating that is not too crowded.  \\n\\nBut that's where the good side ends.  Our server seemed very rushed to take our order after we sat down (at 11am just when they opened).  She came to our table 3 times in a short span of 5 minutes.  We did not realize why until we placed our order for a couple of appetizer dishes (Hand shredded chicken and 7-flavor deep fried squid) and a couple of entree dishes (Fried noodles with chicken, Mapo tofu rice, Sauteed shrimp).  It took almost 35 minutes until our first dish showed up which seem an eternity when one is hungry for brunch.  \\n\\nWhen the food dishes showed up at last, we were very disappointed at every dish.  The hand shredded chicken was more of cut-up pieces of chicken with little taste and too many pieces of skin thrown in.  The 7-flavour deep-fried squid tasted bland -- I tasted salty which is just one flavour as I tried to find more flavour.  The fried noodles looked good but lacked anything special (including taste!).  The sauteed shrimps were not well de-veined so tasted bitter.  We all thought what could possibly go wrong with mapo tofu rice?  Well, the mapo sauce was definitely from a jar so that was pretty hard to mess up, but the rice was too hard (tasted like rice left in a refrigerator overnight).  Very disappointed at the food at Lucky Plus!  \\n\\nTo add to the poor service and bad quality food, we were presented with the same dishes we had already eaten 3 times over!  If the food quality was better we might have taken up their offer!

And I have complained to head office .the service,and food ,and conditions just get worse ,no matter what olive garden u go to . 3 hours to get one bowl of endless soup and salad ,bread sticks.that is UN eatable is ridiculous.

Went in to escape the rain and get a coffee (cash only and don't look for milk or cream cause it's all vegan). Wow. Certainly an eclectic group of individuals hanging out here. And I do mean hanging out because it didn't seem like anyone was going anywhere or had anyplace to go anytime soon.  A little sad (some people were obviously struggling and on hard times) but also refreshing to know that places like this exist. It's real. I got the sense that this place cares and has compassion toward people.  I liked it, energy was good, people were friendly, music was cool and the coffee was excellent.

I insisted we would order more than our share of drinks, oysters and salads but was informed that local zoning laws did not allow for seating outside of patrons who did not order an entree.  So that would mean that someone who preferred 2 dozen oysters and a salad would be breaking the law if they sat ouside.  I could have easily said we were going to order an entree as I noted most outdoor patrons seemed to have \\"claimed\\" but I always prefer to be up front.  No matter how I tried to explain how illogical that this appeared to be, the hostess was not listening and continually repeated the management's rules as explained to her.

I didn't want to write a negative review after my first experience (which was horrible), so I decided to give it a second shot. First time I was here, I had the chicken burrito. It was so bland. If you're going to put rice and beans in all your burritos, make sure they're well seasoned. Their onions are just very huge sloppy chunks. I felt like I was just biting into onions. For my second visit, I decided to go with their popular pork and Chile burrito, chicken quesadilla, nachos with the meat chili and guacamole. Burrito was once again super bland. Half of it didn't even have any meat in it, I thought they accidentally made the vegetarian one. Once I got to the meat, it was once again flavorless... the nachos came out with no meat chili which I had to pay $4 something extra for (good thing I checked my box before I left). The quesadilla was super soggy and dripping with liquid. The guac was under seasoned and didn't even have cilantro in it. Just overall another horrible experience.

How disappointing.\\n\\nIt was a hot summer night, and there's no ventilation inside the restaurant. It's like a sauna in there -- we walked in, and almost walked right out. If it weren't for the fact that a table for two was available right away, we probably would have left. Maybe we should have.\\n\\nWe ordered the chicken liver with capers crostini ($6) which was just ok. It was basically pate, and I like pate, but I was expecting chicken livers -- something a little bit different from pate smeared on toast. Capers were fried beyond recognition or taste.\\n\\nWhen the caprese (buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes & basil, $10) arrived, we nearly gasped. The portion was so small, given the price -- maybe 5 cherry-size tomatoes sliced in half, with a chunk of cheese. It tasted okay, but not worth $10.\\n\\nWhen the pancetta (and... I can't remember) pizza ($15) arrived, we actually gasped out loud because nearly half of the pizza's surface was charred black. We looked up at the waitress, and asked in disbelief, \\"is it supposed to be this burned?\\" She sheepishly answered yes, but offered to do it again if we didn't like it. Uh huh. \\n\\nWhen she took it back to the man-in-charge-of-pizza (not the owner-chef) standing no more than 10 feet away, he angrily tossed the whole pie into the trash. It took another 15 minutes for the replacement to arrive, and though not charred on top, the bottom was still severely burnt black. I don't know -- crispy is one thing, but why would I pay money to eat soot?\\n\\nThe pancetta was super salty, as pancetta can be, but there was nothing else on the pizza to offset or balance the saltiness. It was almost inedible, but we were so hungry by then. In short, the pizza was a disaster.\\n\\nIn conclusion. Strike 1: I was fanning my face with the menu the whole time because it was so unbearably hot in there. Strike 2: The Caprese is a ripoff. Strike 3. When the table next to us cleared, a waitress used a scented chemical-smelling cleaning spray and a rag to wipe it down, and we had to sit for the rest of the evening smelling Pinesol-like fumes.

The decor includes random stuff dangling from the ceiling and each of the tables has Plexiglas over the top-the restaurant put a composer for each table but there is of course the random array of items from past occupants of the table. There are three tables that are considered to be \\"trick\\" tables. One moves up and down-from hitting your knees to hitting your chin, another in and out of the wall (not entirely sure how that works without sending everything crashing to the floor...), and the final is the table for groups that works its way around so you end up with someone else's dessert and/or drink in front of you. Zany and unique topped off with live classical or original music most nights a CD player of instrumentals if no one is performing.\\n\\nThis is also one of the few places where I will talk about the bathroom. I hate public restrooms, I don't care how clean they are I can wait. However,  I would encourage EVERYONE to use Rimsky's restrooms if only to wash their hands.

Yelp does not allow for 1/2 star ratings so i had to opt for 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars because as the law of contracts states when there is an ambiguity within the contract, it will be construed against the party who chose the construction of the contract. \\n\\nStraight to the point as to why I want to give BHOP above a four star rating: Their food is simply the bomb. Always tasty and delicious, their food never disappoints. I'm generally just a straight up Za and Hoagie guy from Pizza Shops. I usually will just stick to the main varieties of what someone would think of when they order from a shop like this Chicken fingers/wings, all sorts of Pizza including cheese when i want to keep the Za pure but will go from anything ranging pepperoni to sexy bacon and jalapeno. I will usually let burger joints stick to burgers IE Five Guys, Big n Tasty, Micky-dees. But BHOPS burgers are out of this world. Simply unreal. I can't forget about their Za either as the BBQ chicken pizza is mouth watering. You can't go wrong with a cheese Za either. But honestly, i can't stop thinking about their suprisingly amazing burgers. \\n\\nLet me tell you one thing about myself before i go further so you can understand the context of this post. I'm an average chiller who likes to play his share of xbox, watch boston sports, and go about my day to day business. One would say i'm an average bro that really appreciates a good bite to eat: burritos, pizza, chinese food, sushi, you name it. I like food. \\n\\nNow lets get to why i didn't give them 5 stars. BHOP deserves 5 stars for how good their food is but i simply cannot do it. They are consistently late with delivery and often forget items. Although I feel bad even saying it because their food is really good but I hope they read this so they can make their service better. Although i hate not getting a can of pepsi, or a missing slice of succulent bacon on da burger i ordered, or when my AMAZING spicy curly fries are not there, I can't hate on them too much because they deliver me delicious BBQ chicken pizza and burgers.  That being said, get it picked up and make sure they don't forget to give you your goods. \\n\\n\\nSincerely Yours,\\n\\nTeam Pizza"},{"name":"Boca Bar","address":"11 Pine St","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"Food was pretty good -- the portions were decent.

The first one involved horrible service.  Most of the dinner was fine, but as we were finishing up our waiter (one of the \\"younger\\" ones - which means 40s or 50s) was so rude and obnoxious in rushing us out it was embarrassing to my (then) girlfriend.  Even after he rushed to get us the check, he came back in 2-3 minutes (no exaggeration), almost literally got up in my face and with a sarcastic tone said \\"thank you for coming\\" -- meaning \\"get out.\\"  I didn't want to make a scene and further embarrass the girlfriend but it was all I could do to keep from it.  Had he not picked up the check I would have marked through any tip and left nothing.   After a while, I decided to try it again and had the shrimp marinara.

Ahhhh)  here in Orlando for a week and I hate chain restaurants.  So I searched Yelp and Groupon and came up with Boteca. Location wise, this restaurant is a little out of the way in a strip mall right across from the Premium Outlets.  We came from the Universal theme parks and your cab driver (who claimed to know all the steak restaurants in the area) had no idea where it was even after we gave him the address and showed him on our phones.  Nonetheless, after a little time, we made our way there.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately.  Surprisingly, it was not busy at 8pm on a Saturday.  However, we discovered that the local Brazilian community must have a later dinner hour than Americans as the place started to fill up around 9pm.  One good sign was that most of the patrons appeared to be South American and not tourists like us.\\n\\nOur server, Leandro, was very friendly and explained all the more unusual Brazilian dishes well and even brought out some farofa for us to try before we ordered.  Surprisingly my 10 year old daughter loved it and ate it all up!  We started with the shrimp with garlic and olive oil.  It was yummy.  Great flavor.  However, we did suggest to the waiter that butterflying the shrimp prior to cooking would make the shrimp more flavorful with the wonderful garlic and olive oil mixture and easier to peel.  The accompanying sauce was wonderful and we ended up keeping some for the rest of our meal.\\n\\nI had the rib eye with fried yucca and grilled vegetables.  The rib eye was delicious, possibly one of the better steaks I have had from a flavor perspective.  It was a little over the medium rare that I ordered but extremely tasty so I didn't mind. The yucca was battered and fried, had a great light batter and was very tasty, especially with the sauce from our appetizer.  I also had both the lime and kiwi caipirinhas.  Both were very strong but I strongly recommend the lime one.  It was smooth, refreshing and quite a nice cocktail.  My husband had the Oswaldo Aranha Filet.  It was well cooked and tender but lacked the flavor of my steak.\\n\\nWe also ordered and shared the beef empanada and a side order of rice and black beans.  The beef empanada's were very nice.  My \\"not hungry\\" 9 year old ended up eating three of them.  The beef is nicely seasoned with olives and had a depth of flavor that was a pleasant surprise.  \\n\\nWe ended a very pleasant meal with the passionfruit mousse and the Brazilian chocolate cream.  We are not big rich dessert people but the passionfruit mousse was a big winner.  They come in petite sized glasses and just the right size after a very filling meal.  All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised by Boteca.  While a lot of the reviews on Yelp were very positive, one never knows when traveling to a new city.  I am so glad we decided to venture off the beaten path!!  Leandro even called us a cab to get us back to our hotel.  Thanks!!

Some of the rooms have a nice view of the gardens, especially from the higher floors.\\n\\nThe one bad experience I had at the Taj was quickly rectified. We were given a room that looked out over the roof of another building and there was noisy air-conditioning equipment right below our window. We asked for a different room and were given one immediately. The experience reinforced my positive feelings about the hotel.\\n\\nThe Taj has some special features--the service, the bar, the bath products and the overall quality of the rooms--and I have had a good experience there every time.

I got the ground beef burrito bowl with potatoes and while it was good it wasn't anything spectacular. I think if I had added cilantro it would have been better. That being said after I added some cheese dip to the bowl it  was much improved.  The cheese dip and chips were the best part of the meal.

Their taco flavors range from standard, to pretty unique. I've tried the baja fish, mojo pork carnitas, cauliflower, tuna tatako, and fried avocado, which I believe may have been a special that day. They were all fantastic and the prices are fair. Drinks cost a bit more and if you are on a budget, you may want to take it easy on that front, but it's still a great place to hit up. I need to stop by the check out the\\"not tacos\\" part of the menu as well as the desserts.

They didn't put anything in this second container - no ginger, wasabi, or shredded daikon/radish as a cushion so the sushi fell over and fish roe went all over the container (see picture).

However, the service was horrible, possibly the worst I've experienced in Portland. This is my first Yelp review ever, which shows how blown away I was by how bad the service was. First of all, my friends and I waited 20 minutes for a server to take our orders, despite there being at least a handful of empty tables. Then, when we got our check, the server automatically added a 20% gratuity to our bill. When I politely asked her about it, she said that it was because we had such a big group (4 people...really?) and that this policy was stated on the menu. My friends and I read over the menu a couple of times and saw nothing about automatic 20% gratuities for a party of FOUR, a very typical group size, if you ask me. No one had told us about this policy until we had already gotten the bill. The combination of the awful service and forcing my friends and I to pay a 20% tip when given the awful service, we would've tipped at most 15% made for a truly horrible experience.

I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.  The woman taking our order wasn't sure if the Pot Pie was included.  She asked someone on her headset and was told that it was...

So, I ordered turkey instead with Squash Casserole & Sweet Potato Casserole.  She said it would take 10 minutes for the turkey.  I got my drink, unsweetened tea. I had to go back to the counter to get Sweet n' Low because there was none next to the fountain.  Another woman handed me Equal when I asked for Sweet n' Low.  She said that was the only sweetener they had (I stopped using Equal years ago when it was deemed the number 1 worst sweetener on the market) I drank Lemonade instead.

No, they do not take reservations and this is no secret so don't go there and then complain that you waited!  Having said that, Vij's is awesome for making the wait worth your while with free chai tea and finger food while you wait.  How many other places do that?\\nThe service is attentive, informed and very pleasant.  Our party of 5 had several servers and each was helpful with suggestions and explanations of dishes.  Although Vij's is busy, we never felt rushed.  I guess some people are dazzled that Vikram comes by each table to welcome his guests, because he has become more recognizable as being on Dragon's Den.  However he has always done this, from years ago, it is not just a gimmick.  He truly appreciates his guests and enjoys engaging with them.\\nWe all loved our dishes, which of course included lamb lollipops, galub jamun and a couple of chicken dishes.  Unless you really do prefer Curry In A Hurry, you can see and taste the care and time that goes into preparing each dish.

They have updated equipments. The tvs are flat screen and big and the mics are wireless and produces sharp clear sounds with no buzzing. The karaoke rooms are quite big, maybe enough for 6 people. Their is also a table where you can eat while singing. They dont have mic covers though, so thats a minus. Their korean songlist is updated, but im not sure about western songs though(I only sing korean songs). If you follow their instructions on using the remote, you wont have a hard time.

First, you choose which type of sandwich you want.  They have the Wicked, Beef, Pork, Turkey, Comfort, Breakfast, Seafood and more.  Based on what type of sandwich you want you choose a bag, then take a red Sharpie and choose what you exactly want on the sandwich.  \\n\\nThe sandwiches come in all kinds of varieties.  The Wicked has 5 kinds of meat on it.  You can get all kinds of sandwiches from turkey and roast beef, to egg salad or seafood salad, or even spam and meatloaf.  There are easily 40 different basic sandwiches that you can choose from.\\n\\nNext, you choose the cheese.  You can choose between cheddar, swiss, provolone, mozzarella, pepper jack and even cheez-wiz.  Then you choose the type of mayo (4 different kinds), mustard (multiple types) and the condiments which range from the ordinary (ketchup) to the unique (salsa, pesto or A1).  Next, you choose onions and what type then the toppings which range from lettuce and tomato to hot pepper mix and olive salad.  Finally, you can even choose the oil, vinegar, herbs and spices you'd like on the sandwich.  All this is filled out on a paper bag!\\n\\nYou take the bag to the cashier and he/she attaches it to a zip line and slides it over to a sandwich assembly line.  Because of the customization, the only problem is that it can take a little while for the sandwich to be made.  However, it is grilled to perfection and delicious when it's done.\\n\\nIn addition to the sandwiches, Which Wich has home made, fresh baked, while-you-wait cookies.  They are divine.  You can also get chips, soda and a shake if you want.  I liked that both Diet Dr. Pepper and Mellow Yellow were an option at the soda machine.\\n\\nThe service was really friendly.

Simple, clean tasting food, healthy, fresh, made right before your eyes.  I REALLY appreciated watching the employees washing their hands frequently.  I can't stress that enough.  People give me shit about grabbing the pepper shaker with a napkin in my hand, but they're also the same people who get sick five or six times a year.  Those things NEVER get wiped down, and Franklin Fecesfinger probably just used it prior to you.\\n\\nThere are two sizes of bowls.  The large bowl is a certified gutbomb, legal ownership requires a background check in Kentucky and Vermont.  it seemed as though I ate for about twenty minutes before the level went below the rim of the bowl.

I honestly could have eaten a bowl of them with the stew.  Certain death would have occured, but oh so worth it.\\n\\nI should point out for the man-bun wearing hipster crowd that the whole place is gluten free. Even the water and napkins.  \\n\\nNow, having recent back surgery made the seating a bit challenging, the whole restaurant has maybe three or four actual chairs with backs.  This is the only reason for a four and not five star review.  The south end has a booth bench which was occupied by a mommy, three year old, and the arsenal of baggage that follows such things.  The other table that had two \\"backed\\" chairs... occupied by some web monkey who felt it was necessary to fill the  other chair with his man purse while shamelessly looking at terribly important doccuments on his notebook, obviously a diary of not bathing and the benefits thereof.  The rest of the seating is fixed wooden stools with no backs.   Cool and trendy looking, I must say I felt very chic sitting there as a fifty some year old fart eating GF Brazilian food, wishing for more crack rolls.  \\n\\nAll in all, I'm glad they're there.

The hostess who was nice but unfortunately works under bad leadership said the restaraunt is low on wait staff. Not sure why the manager has not hired new wait staff yet, speaking of the manager. As soon as he saw me his face looked pained, like how are you the manager and you looked pained to talk to someone!! Anyway, so I asked him why he did not have a waiter for the patio area and he said you can order at the bar and take the food outside and eat at the patio area, but who should have to do that at a restaraunt. Then I asked who is the Franchisee because I would like to speak to someone to rectify this because this is unacceptable(because it is) And he looked even more pained, and was like he is gonna get me the info and to take a seat. So my mom and I take a seat, then we see two ladies leaving and one said I need to talk to the manager and I asked the other lady what happened and she said the waiter waited on people who came after them first and they said they were going to Red Lobster instead. After that we got up and left and said we would meet them there. So my mom and I go to Red Lobster and we walk in and there is no hostess and ppl are sitting down in the front(I guess waiting to be seated) and we wait a good min and no hostess comes up so we leave. As we are walking out we run into the ladies from Fridays and we tell them basically Red Lobster sucks ass too regarding service and the restaraunt had an odor too so we were leaving. My mom and I ended up getting Panda Express and eating it in our car- which ended up being the BEST thing we ever did, because we weren't around anyone with a stank attitude and didn't have to tip a bad waiter.  I say all this to say that CAMP CREEK has SO MUCH POTENTIAL but does the bare minimum to get by regarding service at the restaurants up there and a much needed stop light in the middle of the road across from the Chic Fil A and the Wendy's and whats even worse is that the beautiful amazing black people that live over there DO NOTHING ABOUT THIS. WE NEED A TOWN HALL MEETING or to attend a CITY HALL meeting about Camp Creek because the people in this community should not have to leave to go to Midtown or Buckhead to get decent service. Also NO ONE SEEMS HAPPY at ANY of these restaurants but that is because people still go to camp creek to dine in knowing that the restaurants ain't shit! This restaraunt has 2 stars and I don't even think the owner cares. There is NO professionalism at these places and people put up with it. Not me though, I would rather eat in my car then pay to deal with bul shit and a stank manager. This was typed out of frustration so sorry if there are any typos lol.

The atmosphere in the larger more open spaces is charming, decidedly hipster.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I visited on a pleasant Saturday afternoon and the place was only sparsely populated.  20-30 people in a space that could easily fit 100.  This is likely due to the fact that everything is priced about 59% more than you'd expect for a hip Union Square cafe.  A 16 ounce cup of regular coffee is nearly $3.  The sandwiches almost $9.  For these prices I expect to at least be able to finish my sandwich without constantly having to swat away fruit flies.  I even had to crush one with my index finger when it got itself stuck to a bit of jalepeno jelly.\\n\\nWe both got different hot sandwiches and exchanged halves.  They were both delicious, though the \\"alder\\" was a bit too sweet for both our tastes.  This was the one with the fly trapping jelly.  The \\"Davis\\" was great.

The dollop of high carrot content coleslaw was a nice addition.\\n\\nBathrooms were clean, but the sink drain was a bit clogged in the  men's and the automatic hand dryer didn't work; a roll of those institutional low absorbency brown paper towels was sitting on the sink, soaking up a bit of stagnant sink water on it's edges.  Fine, but at these prices I expect a bit more.\\n\\nThis cafe seems a bit out of place in Union Square.  It would fit in better in Davis or Harvard, even Inman.

I am the kind of person that has to try the place with the big line at least once, to see if it's worth the hype.  The fact that I've gone again is a testament to its quality.  The 45-60 minute wait is mitigated by the self-serve coffee and water available inside.  I wouldn't say that it's worth throwing punches to get a mug in the shape of a cat, but it's probably worth at least a strong elbow or two.  Once you get inside, or the outside seating that's functionally inside (trust me, this is a good thing), expect a pleasant and good-natured server.  That's before the food gets there, and once it does, wow.  I had one of the stacked breakfasts on my first trip.  As of the date of my second trip, I'm working on dropping some pounds.

Basta's is one of the best Italian restaurant's in Portland.  It has survived for so long while so many others have failed because it has remained true to its roots.  Marco started this restaurant as strickly Italian, he and his mother (who would fly over from Tuscany) taught the chefs and developed the menu at the begining.  Over the years Marco has adapted the recipes and the wonderful local ingredients we have here in Portland into the menu, especially the specials.  But the tried and true items on the flip side of the menu always bring us back.\\n\\nThe idea of judging a restaurant by its happy hour menu and service is absolutely insane.  If you are looking for cheap food that taste good go have some tapas.  If you want a good dinner, eat and expect to pay for it.  \\n\\nMany of our personal favorite menu items are the Fennel salad, grilled calamari, any special involving wild mushrooms, Sage and cream chicken breast, my personal favorite is Uncle Victorio's ragu.  The fairly recent addition of gnocchi and pork tenderloin is a good choice as well.  \\n\\nThe service is usually spot on but can be a little slow for American tastes.  Especially if you are coming with children, ours love Bastas.  The special wine dinners and other special meals though out the year are outstanding.  \\n\\nAnd the complaint about the winelist?  Ok I can see it if you don't like Italian wines, because that is the whole list.  But the staff is very good at helping you out with matching wine to your taste and the prices are very good for the amazing store of wine and vintages available.  If you can't find something you like wine wise I think you missed the boat as there is something good for every price range.\\n\\nAnyway I encourage anyone who wants a good meal, a nice dining experience (with or without children) to give Basta's a try.  In my opinion you will not be sorry.  If you want to gripe about the happy hour menu go ahead, I don't go to restaurants for happy hour food specials, thats like going to your favorite restaurant on Valentines day and expecting to be happy."},{"name":"Conin Mexican Cuisine","address":"9111 S Barbur Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Really good fresh food.

La Sabroza had some pretty weak offerings in my mind, with mediocre meats (asada had very little taste) that were slightly overcooked. Tacos Guerrero had good tacos for both breakfast and lunch with ingredients that were nice and cooked together, but both fell woefully short of Granny's, which were exceptional. \\n\\nMy pastor lunch taco at Granny's was marvelous, with a fresh lightly toasted tortilla, wonderfully flavorful pastor, and some nice peripherals like freshly chopped cilantro and just a smidge of pico that brought everything together with their excellent salsas. Wonderful.\\n\\nTacos Guerrero: Single Star (3)\\nGranny's Tacos: Two Stars (4)\\nLa Sabroza: No Stars (2)\\n\\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\\n\\nGranny's? Yes.

The Chicken Katsu came with an iceberg lettuce salad and 2 large ice cream cone scoops of white rice.  The chicken was pounded very thin to give the illusion of quantity.

Didn't see her again for another 5 minutes when she finally came back to take our order.

It was awesome - we had never heard of it, and were so pleasantly surprised by the fun concept, the amazing food, the great service and the abundant wine, we lamented going back to our very new home of Columbus. However, we were overjoyed when we found out there was a location just a mile from our Short North apartment. \\n\\nWe were soon regulars and found ourselves eating garlicky bruschetta, marghertia pizza and glasses of rose as often as we could, on graduate student budgets. The visits trailed out a bit, over the years, but what we started to notice was a number of little changes that have culminated in our most recent bad experience that leads me to believe that we won't be going back. \\n\\nMany things have changed over the years, and at first I assumed it was just me, like the new Buca-for-two menus that didn't really fit with the concept at all, or the lunch items that were of much lesser quality than the dinner entrees (maybe because of lack of volume). Then the wine prices started going up, and they started removing clear favorites from the menu (like the warm tomato salad that we saw other tables around us ordering EVERY time we were there, until they axed it). \\n\\nTonight's experience was sad. I called a week ago to make reservations for 4:30 on a Sunday, which isn't a terribly busy time, but it was after a downtown commencement ceremony, so better safe than sorry. We arrived on time, and our party of 9 was shuttled to the back cramped corner of a tiny room and split into a booth and a nearby table. It took us 15 minutes just to figure out how to fit everyone in. When we asked if there were another table we could be moved to, the waitress (who was very nice and accommodating) said that there weren't enough servers to open up some of the bigger rooms. I mentioned that I had made a reservation, and she said that they were actually having this problem with 4 other families. She did find a table we could move to, but by that time we had already been settled.\\n\\nOne look at the ridiculously heavy, impossible-to-navigate, spiral-bound, laminated menu and it felt like we were at a TGI Fridays. All that was missing was a kitschy cocktail menu...oh, wait...there is one right there. Gone was the placemat and wall menus, and gone is the fun of choosing your food as a family. We ended up just delegating a person (me) to decipher the items and choose a few dishes. \\n\\nThe prices, by the way, were astronomical, and the small/large size thing was confusing. At one point our server was trying to explain, and said \\"well, the pasta large is the same as an entree small, so if you're going to get three entree smalls, get 2 pasta larges and that should be good for our party.\\" My suggestion? MAKE LARGE BE LARGE AND SMALL BE SMALL.\\n\\nWe got the bruschetta and I almost cried. It was basically a huge grocery store hamburger bun, brushed with cheap olive oil with canned diced tomatoes dumped on top. There was no garlic, just a whisper of old brown basil, and, most of all, no flavor. I literally spit it out on my plate. The antipasti salad was fine, but drenched in dressing and not as good as I remember it. The margherita pizza was also still tasty.\\n\\nWe got the rest of the dishes quickly; most of them were luke-warm and over-sauced, while the spaghetti and meatballs was undersauced. I felt sick after dinner because of all the heavy butter and unnecessary oil in the dishes. \\n\\nAs silly as it is, this experience depressed me and we won't be going back any time soon. I will miss what it once was, and certainly won't be recommending it to anyone. Buca's hired the wrong managers that changed way too much from what was working about their restaurant, and I have no doubt their time as a company is limited."},{"name":"La Boite Caf√©","address":"1700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm in love with this place. their drinks, their sandwiches, the treats, the staff, the interior and whole idea behind the place.  props for carrying local Zhi Teas. \\n\\nheaven is their salted caramel macarons."},{"name":"50 Plates","address":"333 NW 13th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"50 Plates recently overhauled their menu, and I have mixed feelings about that.  The old menu had an impressive list of entrees (many of which were fantastic) and smaller dishes.  Entrees came with these wonderful biscuits and rolls, and you got a spoonful of chocolate ganache at the end of your meal.\\n\\nThe overhauled menu only has about 4 entrees on it, and is now mostly a tapas-style restaurant.  It's probably for the best, as \\"50 Plates\\" sounds like a tapas restaurant anyways.  I had the shrimp and grits (official name: Gulfish's fresh wild Louisiana shrimp), which was really really really really really really good.  If you go here, you should definitely get this dish, as it was very flavorful.  I also had the fajita which was also delicious.\\n\\nI would highly warn against the happy hour at this place.  It looks good on paper, but it's one of those happy hours where you realize that you are paying half the price but only getting a quarter of the food.  Also, the happy hour food isn't very good (the mac n cheese in particular is bland and boring).  In other words, you're better off ordering off the regular menu.

We got lucky and only had to wait 30 min for a table of 4 around 8 pm, but I would be fine waiting an hour to eat here, it's that good.\\n\\nThe food here is not authentic Indian food but it's more like an American/Canadian modern-tapas, with a more unique combination of ingredients and ways of preparing food. You won't find this kind of food in most other places in the world. This place and Dishoom (in London) are my favorite Indian places and I would definitely come back here on another trip to Vancouver.\\n\\nAll the plates are meant to be shared, and you can get the entrees as half plates which are smaller but not small enough to share. All the appetizers and the half-entrees were plenty of food for the 4 of us to share. We ended up getting 3 appetizers, 3 half-entrees and one dessert and it was more than enough food for the 4 of us.\\n\\nCornmeal flatbread topped with spiced greens, tomato masala, lentil sprouts and black chickpeas ($14.50) - I really loved this - it was so unique. I love anything cornmeal / corn, so the base of this flatbread was great - not like a tortilla or a pizza but more like a thick tortilla / masa, with a generous amount of toppings. It is a bit spicy so beware if you don't like spicy food. I loved this.\\n\\nGaram masala saut√©ed portobello mushrooms in porcini cream curry ($15.50) - Another unique dish as you don't see a lot of mushrooms in Indian dishes, at least not portobello or porcini mushrooms. Definitely not very healthy because of all the cream but really tasty and unique with different flavors of mushroom in the sauce and the veggies.\\n\\nEggplant in thick yogurt and garlic curry ($16) - Another winner. Not very healthy since the eggplant was deep fried, but the taste and execution here was great.\\n\\nBC seasonal coconut curried vegetables on green lentil and brown basmati rice pilaf ($26.50, full size, $16, half size) - This was my least favorite of the bunch. It wasn't bad but it was pretty basic: vegetables in a coconut curry sauce. The veggies are fresh but pass on this.\\n\\nPunjabi style goatmeat curry with spiced vegetables  ($30.50, full size, $16, half size) - My Dad loved this; I really loved the curry sauce - it was spicy but still edible. The meat is a bit tougher and almost more like lamb which is not my favorite. But the curry was awesome for dipping the naan into. Worth a try for something different.\\n\\nRainbow trout in coconut and fenugreek seed masala ($29, full size, $16, half size) - This was my favorite of the entrees that we got. I loved the coconut flavor and the fish was fresh.\\n\\nThey give you naan with the appetizers and then brought out more naan and rice with the entrees. The naan was fresh, hot and fluffy, and the rice was also very good.\\n\\nWe finished with a rice pudding but I didn't love this much as I thought I would. The texture was a bit runny, but the taste was good. I don't think I would get this again.\\n\\nOverall, wonderful place with lots of options for sharing everything and lots of interesting twists on Indian food.

Some things were great like the smoke cobia. The hen of the woods mushrooms were cooked perfectly in the black grouper main course; the fish itself was good, but not special. The Pork Porterhouse (their specialty) was dry and tough."},{"name":"Gulu-Gulu Cafe","address":"56 Central Square","city":"Lynn","stars":"4","text":"I love this place. Coffee was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was excellent. I can't wait until they open in salem!"},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I've been to the Ravenous Pig on three separate occasions and each time was nothing less than stunning.  The menu changes monthly, though a few of the best items tend stick around. \\n\\nThe pub burger, with caramelized onions and truffled fries is great anytime, lunch or dinner, but if you're looking for the best experience, I would suggest dining in a group and ordering a few appetizers - the lobster tacos and artisan meat & cheese board are my favorites - and a few of the hearty seasonal entrees, followed of course, by a dessert or two. \\n\\nBe prepared to share. While most restaurants tend to serve portions that either too small or absurdly large, The Pig tends to provide just the right size but everything looks and smells so fantastic you'll want a taste of everything that lands on the table."},{"name":"Beacon Street Tavern","address":"1032 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"I have been here for a birthday booze fest, a quiet weekend dinner, and post-work cocktails. I very much enjoyed all three occasions. \\n\\nThe drinks here are great, especially the ones off the cocktail menu. I recommend the painted lady, a champagne and juice cocktail. \\n\\nThe one time I ate there I had scallops and sweet potato french fries, and the waitress suggested a white wine to go with that was good. Can't remember the name. Both were very good. My friend had the oysters and thought they were overpriced, but was happy with his beer selection."},{"name":"Five Horses Tavern","address":"535 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wasn't sure what to expect but it was very much a bar room atmosphere. I tried to get a reservation for 7 on Open Table and the only table was at 5:30 - problem was the place was empty all night. No idea why I couldn't get the res. multiple items on the menu not available. All that said the food was really good."},{"name":"Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld","address":"6677 Sea Harbor Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"not sure, if I ever saw such a huge hotel.\\n\\nvery professional organized, very friendly staff, very fast problem solving.\\nnice pool area with a separate kids aqua park.\\nfitness center was nice, not all days equally well prepared.\\nsushi bar (in the middle) with unfortunately limited choice.\\nbreakfast buffet very nice and affordable.\\nvery nice valet parking staff.\\nthe best concierge service we had in this almost 3.5 weeks trip in Florida."},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The service is touch-and-go and the food is consistently bland & boring.  The first occasion I went to the bar inside.  The bar floor was sticky & 'kritched' everytime I took a step.  It was worse than the stereotyped floors of Peep Shows, etc.  I asked (VERY politely) about the house draft.  The answer I got was 'look buddy its just a light beer, OK?'.  Jeesh!  What a way to guarantee yourself no more than 15% tip, and left on a credit card to boot in lieu of actual CASH!   The stickly floor & snappy answer all happened before I even got a menu to open up and read.  The food was bland as if it was done intentionally.  NO chances here, folks. \\n\\nI really had no intentions of ever going again and this would've been a one-star review if it were not for a non-profit fundraising event a local hospital was running at Brookhaven station.  Hudson Grille, Mellow Mushroom & Pub 71 all share a common patio area at Brookhaven station that each establishment marks off with movable gates, etc.  For the fundraiser, all three establishments removed the gates so folks could easily mingle between the locations & make for a fun outdoor party.  I sat over on Hudson Grille's outdoor patio & ordered a meatball sub.  The food was, once again, typically uninspired Hudson-Grille bland but the service & bartender was top-notch this time around.  As such, I bumped them up to 2 stars from 1 star."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"8687 W Highway 192","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"Worst Dominos.

I base this on texture. Congee otherwise doesn't have much flavor and it's not supposed to. It's made in it's purest form then complimented with meats or vegetables and seasoned as you like it.\\n\\nTheir dimsum is also good but it's the Congee that brings me there and brings me back every time."},{"name":"Cactus Club","address":"939 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The food was decently priced, and the drinks weren't too bad either. The bar usually gets really crowded and loud, so if you are going there to get drinks and talk, you better sit in the dining room, or outside. I didn't think that their food was all that great, though."},{"name":"Taco Mac - Lindbergh","address":"573 Main St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"This Taco Mac is a great local place for me to have a beer, but every time I try to eat here the food is just a let down.\\n\\nLet me reiterate - the beer, as everyone knows, is awesome. I love coming here to try different micro and craft brews on tap. Plus the place it within walking distance for me, so that's a huge plus.\\n\\nThe food just always lets me down. The burgers are eh. The buffalo chicken fingers were actually bad (how is this possible?), and the wings not much better. The southwestern stuff here is your best bet, but I never find myself wanting a burrito in a sports bar setting. I've learned to just stick with the nachos (either version - one has chicken and one has beef and chili), which are actually quite good.\\n\\nSolid place but don't make a trip for the food."},{"name":"Swank Restaurant","address":"808 SW Taylor Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"In Portland briefly, couldn't get into the \\"must go\\" places, and ended up here, partly because I know a chef here, from SF. I know it's new, and it was Sunday night, early, but should have been busier. \\nStarted with oysters, so good we ordered another round. A touch of seasoning, subtle and perfect. Fois gras was a must, coming from the deprived state where it's now not legal. Coffee cured, with red eye gravy and peaches, a generous portion in thin slices, unctuous, delicious. Shared the crisp, perfectly cooked sweetbreads next. Another twist on breakfast, served with bacon, maple syrup and an egg filled ebelskiver. Yum! Segued to a light, refreshing salad with a generous amount of good greens, pickled white strawberries, cherries, goat cheese, then shared an entree of sous vide then bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin, crisp outside, pink and juicy inside, with a well balanced white bean salad, crisped cauliflower, and apricot chutney.\\nWine list pretty pricy, but the bottle of Anderson valley Pinot matched well with the food. We didn't order dessert, but our friend brought a plate with the dessert of the day, and they definitely have a good pastry chef. \\nWith the meal starting with a little amuse, and ending with a little gift of house made jellies and caramel, we were impressed. Not overly costly for the quality, everything scrupulously fresh with a strong local emphasis and a deft hand with seasoning, a worthy meal in pleasant surroundings, with friendly, attentive service."},{"name":"The Pool Hall","address":"30 Irby Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This is another perfect hole-in-the-wall dive bar in Buckhead.

This is what a dive bar should be."},{"name":"J. Gilbert's Wood Fired Steaks & Seafood Columbus","address":"1 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Overhyped for the price. I thought this would be a special place for the wife and my anniversary. I was right about the romantic atmosphere at least but the rest, not so much. \\n\\nWe started with the onion rings which might have been our favorite part of the meal. I really liked all four sauces they came with. The steak was good and tender but needs a serious seasoning addition. My wife didn't like any of the sides, and I thought most of them were below average. The lobster mac was very bland and I ended up picking out the lobster pieces to eat and leaving the rest. I liked the asparagus but I think I got maybe 6 stalks in total. The wine list was impressive but most were out of my price range. I settled for a mediocre bottle of chardonnay that tasted like could have been had for a few bucks at a grocery.\\n\\nDessert was pretty good creme brulee but nothing to write home about. I'll take the creme brulee at Figlio any day. Also they got our order wrong the first time and brought my wife an incorrect side. For two people, the bill came to about 100 bucks which we both felt bad for spending given the quality.
