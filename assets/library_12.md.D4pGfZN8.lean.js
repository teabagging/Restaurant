We were early for the surprise dinner he had reservations for, and we quite literally stumbled across it while walking down the street. On coming into the restaurant you're immediately informed by the tenor and the atmosphere that this place is swanky af. There's a wall covered in corks, the d√©cor is painfully contemporary, and the lighting is dim enough to put you in a wine-drinking mood but not so dim you wonder if they're trying to keep you from getting a good look around. And (in case the wall of corks wasn't enough of a nod to the name) they have bottles of wine everywhere - even hanging from the bathroom ceiling. The host was great and let us sit wherever, the bartender slash server was also great and answered our innumerable questions with a smile. It might have been a 'customer service' smile, but it sure convinced me.\\n\\nI'd love to tell you about the food, but since we were only there for a pre-dinner drinks we didn't actually eat much. We each ordered 1.5 glasses of wine from their very long, very impressive, and very intriguing wine list. I mean, that is kind of their whole thing. So, 10/10 lived up to the hype. Despite the fact that I am a budding wine snob, I don't quite remember which wine I ordered. It was a delicious ros√© brut that another patron sitting near us had ordered. I'm not usually a ros√© gal, but this one looked so pink and inviting in the glass. It practically glowed in the dim light from the bar. When it came time to order, I attempted to discreetly inform the bartender (read: pointed and whispered loudly) that I wanted \\"whatever wine that was\\". I think the bartender laughed a little. She was a good sport. Looking at their menu online afterwards, I believe that it was the Camille Braun from Alsace. It was delicious and drinkable and not too sweet, and the bubbles were so fine that as a habitual $10 champagne drinker I felt almost unworthy. Husband ordered the Les Hospices Chenin blanc, which I of course tasted and I of course found lovely.\\n\\nThe food menu was long for what you'd expect from a wine-focused joint, but it was full of variety and it all sounded very very good. The portions (we shamelessly observed the diners around us) looked large enough to satisfy, but really only just. Personally, that's a plus. Got to save room for more wine! We did end up ordering something to munch on, although 'munch' is not quite the right word. We got a board with prosciutto and their 6-month aged pecorino, and bread and olive oil. The prosciutto was paired with pickled red peppers and these little baby gherkins and a delicious sort of... mustard-flavored mayonnaise? I'm not quite sure. And the pecorino was paired with some simple walnuts and honey. The prosciutto was sliced very finely and it was wonderfully soft and buttery. It was great all on its own, but I tore off pieces (with my hands, like a savage) to go on top of a piece of the bread spread with that mustard/mayo concoction. It was heavenly. The pecorino dunked in the honey was unexpected and delightful. I know now, after a quick google, that pecorino and honey is actually not at all an unexpected pairing to anyone who knows anything, but I alas do not fall into the category of 'someone who knows something'. It was a mouthwatering education.\\n\\nIn the end, I must say, it was all exquisite. This restaurant is definitely geared towards your serious wine drinkers, but as baby oenophiles they made us feel just at home as the regulars you could spot dotting the bar. However, I will reserve final judgement until we can come back and have a proper meal."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me paint a picture for you.

I grabbed a couple of friends and colleagues at a conference I was attending and we walked to the closest Gladys Knight (yes, in GA there's more than one). \\n\\nThere wasn't the 30 minute wait the hotel concierge had predicted. Our group of 7 was immediately seated. I ate mac & cheese, smothered chicken, hot cornbread plus fries so I wouldn't leave any of that amazing gravy on the plate.

Not sure why I've gone back every time, nothing really stands out for me at this particular bakery, but its close to my home and nephew's school- sweet tooth gets to me some days!! :/ \\n\\nStaff, overall, are not so friendly. There is a woman who works in the cafe side of the bakery, she's not very clear when she is speaking to the customers, and when I asked her a question during one of my visits, she answered me as she turned around and gave me her back. When I asked her to repeat herself, she gave me this look as if I had ten heads! It was fairly quiet and slow that day, I cant imagine how she'd behave with a crowd. \\n\\nTheir coffee isn't the greatest. The pastries are not my favorite, not fresh. They are decent, even that may be reaching. Their Gelato, is not good! Too artificial for my taste and not so smooth, when the worker was helping me, the Gelato seemed to come out in chunks as oppose to rolling onto the spoon with each stroke. The one thing I do enjoy is their packaged milk chocolate and packaged toasted sesame-seed cookies. Love them! \\n\\nI will not be visiting this place again. The last straw was today, Thursday early afternoon. The worker at the register, was obviously new. He was friendly overall, but seemed very lost and nervous when we presented two www.Groupon.com worth $10 each. My sister and I went in with one coupon each (mine was a gift from her). If anyone is familiar with these sites, they understand that even when you buy a voucher as a gift, both coupons, will have similar Voucher #'s except for the last digit- as long as they were purchased at the same time. Well, this turned out to be a major issue! He proceeded to call the owner, who then I spoke to. He said I couldn't use it, even as a separate transaction, only one per day was allowed. NOT MENTIONED IN THE VOUCHER. He said it's under the same account and doesn't matter if it was a gift. RIDICULOUS. \\n\\nI then said it was unfair because it was a gift and whether I use it today or tomorrow, I have already paid for it online and it wouldn't be an issue even if I had walked in 15minutes after my sister used hers! He then said I was trying to scam him- TERRIBLE BUSINESS MAN. I told him, it wasn't right and he asked me if it was right that he had to sell his pastries for less than what it's worth. I mean, reality is nobody pulled his arm to put his business on Groupon.com . Essentially, the reasons why you are putting your establishment on these sites, is to get more business, being cheap and obviously not knowing the *fine print* of what you're getting into, makes it even more frustrating for me- the customer. \\n\\nGranted I wasn't a regular, but doesn't mean you can treat me less than, or as somebody who is trying to scam you for $10 worth of pastries.

The decor was good - not knowing that it was designed by Taniya Nayak, we commented that it looked a lot like her work, which is a good thing! The setting was warm and inviting.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nI started with the special appetizer, a \\"kobe beef' corn dog with a jalapeno corn bread. It was luke warm at best, the meat was just ok, and the batter was a bit undercooked. A huge disappointment, especially since I'm a huge hot dog fan and was looking forward to a special corn dog.\\n\\nThe mussels were tasty, but the bread that was served with it was over-toasted (read: burnt) and the broth was salty.\\n\\nThe chicken wings were very tasty.\\n\\nThe seafood tacos got a positive review, except for the lime served with them - it was so dry and hard that it was impossible to get any juice from them. A second half yielded similar results.\\n\\nEntrees:\\nMy brother and I both got the crispy duck confit special served with cashews, some leafy veg, and mango sticky rice, all on a banana leaf. The duck was really unenjoyable. It was both salty and bland. The mango sticky rice was similarly bland and very mushy. Our two dishes looked fairly different from each other - one dish had more cashews and the it looked like two different rices underneath the pieces of duck. Oh, I did enjoy the cashews.\\n\\nOur friends both ordered the grilled ahi tuna. Compared to the portion size of our duck dishes, these dishes were tiny (but served on a large plate), with one serving of tuna being half the size of the other. Quite a disappointment. Our friends seemed to like it. The sesame rice is simply white rice with sesame sprinkled on top. Yawn.\\n\\nDessert:\\nGluttons for punishment that we are, we opted to get some dessert. We ordered two each of the banana-toffee jar and the chocolate peanut butter pie. Not a lot of care went into the production of these dishes which were served in small jars. Such a great opportunity to impress with presentation, and they missed the mark. The banana-toffee jar was very rich and very sweet which obscured the taste of the dish. More banana would have been nice. Also, the jar was very narrow, so hard to scoop up through they layers. The chocolate peanut butter pie was VERY heavy on the peanut butter.\\n\\nIf they can improve the quality (and get better exhaust fans so you aren't overwhelmed with smoke when you come into the restaurant) and consistency of dishes,it might be a good place.\\n\\nOne last thing - haphazardly throwing parsley on a dish isn't really finishing it."},{"name":"Marshall's","address":"1105 W 1st Ave","city":"Grandview Heights","stars":"3.5","text":"I personally love the crab & cheese omelet!

I've had Franklin's before, and while I thought it was decent, I really didn't get what the hype was about. The brisket here was incredibly moist, soaking the paper through, though some of my coworkers stated some of theirs was a little dry in the middle. I am guessing this was because we lost a lot of moisture to the paper. The pulled pork while tasty was nothing special.  There was a mixed response to the sausage with some of us enjoying it immensely and others stating it was a bit too coarse. The beef rib was fantastic, moist, flavorful, HUGE. The turkey was a disappointment as I wasn't expecting it to be completely chilled as if they had just pulled it from the fridge. \\n\\nSides were well received, the chipotle slaw has a bit of a kick so if you can't handle heat you may want to take a pass.

I said I'd wait for a table and see if one opened up soon even though the counter was wide open, because I was tired and really wanted a table.  The hostess decided that meant I didn't want a table or counter seat and didn't write me down on her pad.  I barely noticed this detail in the moment, but it became critical and painful later, when, despite having full knowledge of my presence there for the last 10 minutes, she proceeded to seat everyone that had gotten there before and after me first, since my name was not on the pad!!  I couldn't believe it.  I even offered to seat myself at the wide open counter, but apparently that is NOT ALLOWED.  She became testy.  Apparently, you have to be walked to the exact seat the hostess wants you to sit in -- or else!  \\n\\nTwenty minutes after I arrived, I finally got to sit down.  I had already considered walking out and going over to Life Alive where there is no nonsense getting a seat, and guaranteed tasty food, but I decided to forgive Veggie Galaxy for the terrible hostess, irrational unfair and lengthy seating experience, and move on to ordering food immediately.  Sadly, no one made eye contact with me, I was studiously avoided as I sat there confused, wondering how to order at the counter.  Normally there is a person behind the counter who takes the orders and provides water, but here all the young men seemed far too busy cooking to even glance at me or tell me that someone would be with me soon.  I resorted to asking a fellow diner for assistance.  From him I learned a waiter might someday take my order.  \\n\\nOrdering was fairly painless.  Let me note that the entire time I had been seated I was excruciatingly uncomfortable and felt like a two year old, as the only footrest was about a foot away from my feet.  I'm an average height female, so this place was made for people over 6ft tall...   I noticed every seat had this exact problem table or counter.  Never have I been to a diner or any restaurant with such uncomfortable awkward seating.  \\n\\nOk, food time.  I tried the daily vegetable special, the pancake and the tofu egg. \\nThe tofu egg was good, though a bit too salty.  The pancake was not whole grain, but was fine - the coconut whipped cream was fantastic.  The daily vegetable special was, however an utter disgusting disaster.  It consisted of collards, sweet potato, garbanzo beans and rice.  This was the only information I could extract from the waiter who seemed constitutionally unable to describe the dish in any further detail.  I asked him if the items were steamed and he half-heartedly agreed.  I like fresh plain steamed veggies so this sounded great.  Fast forward to meal delivery...  Nothing on the plate is steamed.  The collards were fine, though burned and in an oily sauce.  The sweet potato slices were undercooked and tasted not-fresh.  The rice was the disgusting piece-de-resistance.  It was cold, mixed with garbanzo beans, and tasted sour - not like fresh lemon juice or vinegar, but like something left out too long at a picnic, and then refrigerated.  The texture was mushy and congealed.  The rice was white and possibly of the minute variety.  It was very possibly the worst most disgusting rice I've ever had.  \\n\\nThis meal, easily consumed by one, cost over $20.  It also was awful.  The waiter did not seem to notice or care that I had left behind a large amount of my meal.  After I paid (including 15% tip) I told him I thought the rice was spoiled. He didn't offer any consolation - a free dessert, another meal on the house, or a coupon or gift card for future visit.  This may not have been in his power to correct, so I don't blame him directly, but it was bad policy either way.  I will not be back.  Awful service, awful food.  A tofu egg and coconut whipped cream are not enough to draw me back to such a bad experience.\\n\\nI also noticed that the gluten free food is not carefully separated, nor does it appear the grill is cleaned or any care is taken to keep bread away from gluten free items on the grill.  So I would strongly advise against this restaurant for the gluten sensitive.  \\nAdditionally at the counter I had a front row seat to food prep and noticed labels on bins of food indicating they had been made at least 5 days prior.  To me, this is unacceptable.  I pay at restaurants to have freshly prepared food not food kept in the fridge for a week and brought out for my consumption.  At that rate frozen dinners would be fresher.  \\n\\nPlease avoid this restaurant if you are a new vegan or trying to impress any non-vegan or non-vegetarian friends.  I suggest Life Alive up the street for a much friendlier, more comfortable, quality food experience."},{"name":"The Red Wagon","address":"2128 East Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Pulled pork pancake and JD maple syrup.

I perused the isles to see what stuff they have, and they do stock a lot of the same things you'd find in the Whole Body section section at Whole Foods or the same section at Central Market. However, the one glaring difference is the prices. There's quite a mark-up in the products they sell, and for some of them, you could save as much as $3-$4 by buying them at the aforementioned grocery stores.

We had a party of 5 and we ordered guac, which was ok, queso that was a congealed mess and then baha, chicken, vegetable and pork tacos. Lets just say that the baha tacos were essentially Gortons fish-sticks thrown in a shell. The chicken and accompanying soggy vegetables all had some gross spice dumped on them.

You can imagine my delight when I found out that there was a decent Thai place only a few minutes away from my office. I now order from Rock Sugar Cafe once every week or two to get my Drunken Noodle fix (don't judge). I must say that I pretty much stick to this one dish because a) I'm mildly addicted and b) the one time I did try another option (Cashew Nut Chicken) I was a bit disappointed, as it was lacking in flavor.

I figured the best restaurant in town might know a thing or two about delicious brisket in Austin, and they sure did. This was the longest I had ever waited for food, and after tasting it, I would have easily waited double the time. All in, on a beautiful Sunday afternoon in the 70s, I waited a total of 1.5 hours. While you wait in line and while you dine there, they offer free beer from a keg.. I am from Miami where nothing is free so this was a great treat. \\n\\nWe were a party of two girls and ordered the following: 1 lb of brisket (we originally asked for .5 but after tasting it, went for an additional slice), .5 pounds of pork ribs, 1 homemade sausage, 1 pint of bacon buttercream potato salad and 1 single serving of cole slaw. Keep in mind you have to order the fatty brisket... The most incredible tasting, melt in your mouth piece of meat you have ever had... And now that I've said that, it's a tie between the delicious pork ribs and that brisket... Juicy, flavorful, fall off the bone perfection. The sausage is also great but I am partial to pork and brisket. We did not try the beef ribs because they were sold out before 1PM. We got into the line at 11:15AM so be advised. That potato salad was off the chain delicious. It is not drowning in mayonnaise, and seems like it is made with a good grainy mustard- perfection. But my date preferred the cole slaw and I barely got a bite in. So either way, you'll be good. Seems to me you shouldn't waste your stomach on a sandwich, don't let yourself get full on bread.. That is not the game changer here. \\n\\nThe remains were taken home, and saved for yet another perfect and delicious meal.

Never having been abroad myself, it fits perfectly in my romanticized view of what Irish pubs should be- the design looks like someone's inviting home complete with fireplace, and the booths are thoughtfully placed to accommodate large groups or just the two of us. There are always regulars engaging in converation with the staff, but it never feels like you're excluded even when you're new to the place. \\n\\nGreat selection of whiskey; so far we've had a few of our mainstays, a few friend recommendations, and one the bartender offered after learning our tastes. \\n\\nThe bartenders will also make a Black Velvet with a bottled cider, since I'm not a fan of Magners (the only cider on tap) and they're really helpful when undecided.\\n\\nThe food! Holy crap, the food. The scotch egg is amazing, and the sausage rolls are heavenly (my boyfriend and I have to get two orders now because we don't want to share) The stew is perfect, with huge meaty chunks and veggies, and the shrimp & crab chowder is insanely good. Get the fries with a side of gravy- I dip EVERYTHING in this gravy. I can't wait to try more off the menu - the mussels, the sandwiches, any of the savory pies.

Back then, Shin Jung was a 'typical' Korean place, i.e. not very fancy.  We went 07/04/2013 and I was impressed w/ the interiors... they remodeled and have a more modern, nearly upscale look now, with an actual wait staff that isn't a bunch of family members. LOL.  The food was great, but as a half-Korean, I'm used to this sort of fair.  My wife, a non-Korean, really enjoyed the Kal bi and bul gol gi and the side dishes.  My mother ordered a 'chi-gae' (not sure how to spell it) and actually raved about it (to hear my mom compliment restaurant food is a once in a lifetime thing, ESPECIALLY in regards to a Korean restaurant).  What more, the staff was more than nice and accomodating (our waitress, who was NOT Korean, did this amazing thing where she faked her way through a conversation my mom tried to have with her in Korean... that is some excellent patience and intuition).  THere does come a price for this food, but the current price really reflect A.. The growing American trend/interest in Korean cuisine and B.. The fact that there's only really 3 or 4 Korean restaurants in the entire Central Florida area (Central Florida = across 2 counties and 8 municipalities), so the choices are extremely limited.  According to my mom's Korean friends, cities with larger Korean communities have more competition, and thus you may find this food priced less in other cities, like Atlanta and such.\\nOne should understand or at least try to embrace the culture of world cuisine to enjoy it.  The person complaining about having to cook their own food is an idiot.  If you went to Chili's or something similar and ordered a hamburger, would you complain that you had to eat with your hands? Not to mention in just about any Korean restaurant, they absolutely will prepare the meat in the kitchen and bring it to you cooked if you prefer (truth be told, most Korean restaurants would rather do it that way and will ask).  So certainly a dumb complaint no matter how you cut it.\\nWith so few choices in the Central Florida area, Shin Jung is definitely one of the better choices for more authentic Korean cuisine.  All the flavors were good and the meat was both season well and of great quality.  And mom only had nothing but nice things to say about the 'stew'.

Super casual spot but a great menu. Great spot for a laid back afternoon/evening in the neighborhood. Local draft beers as well as numerous quality imports and domestics, creative cocktails and a short but appropriate wine list. Snacks such as house-made pickles, olives and nuts, an ox-tongue slider (now, it seems, a staple of new age bar food), as well as smaller plates such as a delicious quinoa fruit salad including house-made ricotta and Fredricksburg peaches. The grilled cheese on house-made brioche is evil and the Dewberry Hills chicken served with patty pan squash and rainbow chard is perfect. They do rabbit & dumplings as well as a sausage-of-the-day. The ice cream of the day, this time a delicious pistachio gelato (also house-made), is the perfect way to end an enjoyable summer evening. The open-air atmosphere is enchanting and while the wait staff could be a little bit more attentive they are nonetheless quite friendly.

We were in line by 10:30 (about a dozen in line before us) and we were eating shortly after 11 because they started cutting and selling a few minutes before 11.  As others have said, the rib really was amazing.  Almost falling off the bone, but with enough tooth and beefy flavor to really enjoy chewing on it like a carnivore.  The brisket was like butter.  Fat rendered perfectly, bark just barky enough.  We tried the turkey based on other reviews and it was pretty good -- on the edge of dry but we were the first to order it that day and he was cutting from the end -- but I would get more brisket next time.  We loved the house-made pickles.  Just the right amount of spice and clean vinegary acid to help with the fatty meats.  Nice people behind the counter.  A decent mix of tourists (some even with suitcases getting their fix on the way to the airport after SXSW), and locals who seemed to be able to eat an inordinate amount of barbecue for their size.  Will definitely go again next trip to Austin."},{"name":"The Metropolitan Club","address":"1210 Boylston St","city":"Chestnut Hill","stars":"3","text":"Average.

The chicken was tender, flavorful and nicely charred with grill marks.  The teriyaki sauce had a thick enough consistency to stick to the food.  I like that.  (I don't like thin watery teriyaki sauce like some other places have.)  The accompanying salad was fresh and crispy too.

There were a few families with small children. Overall very comfortable.\\n\\nThe beer list was broad with a lot of old standards, but several craft beers that I was not familiar with. My wife had a Hops and Scotch cocktail which was fair. I had a Texas sliders appetizer which was good, although one of the sliders had dry bread. The Chicken Marsala and Burger were good. The Shrimp Po Boy was a little greasy but tasty. French fries were hand cut and cooked well.  Lobster roll had very little mayo but a lot of celery and other seasoning, so that you could not even taste the lobster. The desserts were very expensive, but not very good. They were freshly made or were made on the premise, with the exception of the flourless chocolate cake.\\n\\nAll told, very expensive and not as good as you would hope.

No one in the store and if they are slammed, that means they are slammed with delivery orders. So I ask how long just to make me a slice? They state ten minutes. Now come on, give me a break. I'm from New York and of course NY makes the best pizza. Every time I have entered a New York pizzeria, they always had a couple pies made and under a heat lamp. So if you wanted a slice, they just threw one in the oven for a couple minutes and you had it.\\nI guess Southside doesn't do things that way. So I left with no pizza from them and will never return to a business that places such a low priority on walk in customers.

The paloma was delicious and strong. The burro tasted like sour mix and not so much ginger beer. Bummer! I got the strawberry margarita.

On the other hand, the ice chunks were so big that it was constantly clogging up the straws and annoying to sip from the glass as well. Swallowing ice shards! Drinks at $9 each, but all beverages were nice and strong and worth the dollars.\\nWe decided to split a bunch of items, which turned out well. Complementary chips and salsa were given.. One was a blended mexican style salsa with a bit of a kick. This one was my favorite. The BFF like the tex-mex salsa better, which was more along the lines of pico de gallo. He looooved that one. We also got the mussels. It was spicy, like the server told us, but not overpoweringly so. They were delicious. Fish tacos were really good, but the shrimp, not as much. Ceviche tostada thingy was alright, but the avocado lime puree was overpowering, and whatever chopped peppers (I suppose it was jalepenos but there was absolutely no kick) were whatever.

There was, however, one glaring omission: no decaf! The barista cheerfully brewed a new pot of decaf (hot) coffee so she could make me a decaf iced coffee, but of course you then either have to wait a while for it to cool or accept that the ice will dilute it.

It's super easy to miss walking down 21st, it's a very small place in the ground floor of one of the Alphabet District's many older apartment buildings.  Several inside tables and a couple outside tables right on the sidewalk.\\n\\nOver the course of several meals here, I've gotten to try their pulled pork, BBQ chicken, and brisket, and all of them are excellent.  If I had to rank them, I definitely lean towards the pork or chicken (both of which are simply phenomenal, especially with a dash of their vinegar sauce to bring out the flavor), but you really can't go wrong with your order here.\\n\\nTheir sides are generally solid, but some are better than others--the beans and (as other reviewers have noted) the mac and cheese are both simply delicious.  The coleslaw is above-par as well.  As far as taste goes, their cornbread is similarly delicious (as is the honey that comes with it), yet it is also a little over-baked for my preferences.  But I realize that this is a minor complaint.\\n\\nThey have a decent selection of beer by the can, and their beers are generally reasonably priced (relative to, you know, restaurant prices for alcohol these days).  I have not tried any of their wines.\\n\\nTheir happy hour (3-6 pm every day) menu is alright as well--there's usually some sort of beer discount, and they offer sliders plus discounts on a number of their sides.\\n\\nService is informal but usually pretty good.  I received somewhat subpar service once but have received very friendly and attentive service every other time.  The staff definitely cares a lot, but they also do not seem take themselves too seriously, which is nice.\\n\\nFinally, I have to add that this is also a stellar place as far as bang-for-your-buck goes--you can get a sandwich + one side for $10.

This restaurant is GREAT. When I went, tonight, on a Saturday evening around 6:30 PM, the wait was long (~35 minutes). The service was really quite good for how crowded they were.\\n\\nNow, the real review.\\n\\nI just got done at Chicken & Waffles. I just walked back in to my hotel room.\\n\\nAs I said, I went to Chicken & Waffles on a Saturday night at \\"prime time,\\" about 6:30 PM. I took a taxi over from Atlantic Station and as we drove up, the driver said, \\"Whoa, there's quite a line.\\" That didn't deter me, though. I'm in town for a conference, which has now ended, and everyone I know left early this morning. I've got nothing but time. I was by myself, too. If the hosts and hostesses were irritated that I was going to take a whole booth to myself, they didn't show it. They were frank (about the wait), polite (smiling and courteous), and seemed to be getting things done without treating anyone like they were stressed or harried. \\n\\nMy advice to you? Plan an hour of wait time, then, when you get in faster than that, you'll be very happy. They told me 45 minutes and I got in after 30 or 35, and that was awesome.\\n\\nNow, I have to say--for a place that's called Chicken & Waffles, I was expecting more than one option for chicken and waffles--maybe a breast and leg plate with a waffle, and a leg and thigh plate, etc. etc. I flipped through the menu three times and could only locate one chicken and waffle dish, the Midnight Train!\\n\\nThat was fine; that dish sounded good to me. It's four jumbo chicken wings (but really, it's the whole wing, not just the little nubs you get on a hot wings platter--you get everything from the shoulder joint down) and a big round waffle.\\n\\nIt was sooo good. SO GOOD. I'm not a fried chicken person. I'm that obnoxious soul who gingerly peels off all the batter and skin and eats the meat underneath. I'm not much of a meat person, either, truth be told. Not so here. I pounded all four chicken wings and the big ol' waffle by myself. Oh yeah, I ordered a Coke, too--it was a lot bigger than I was expecting, probably a 32 oz., but I drank that dry, too.\\n\\nIn short, this place made a small eater who doesn't like meat into a hungry carnivore. Their coating is crisp and flavorful. The wings really are jumbo (I'd be scared to see the chickens they came off--they were probably more like turkeys). The waffle was like... what an Eggo would be if you made it homemade and with a lot of butter in the batter. It has that distinct, \\"Oh, this can't be good for me\\" taste--rich, and fluffy.\\n\\nI only took a star off for the long wait, and because I did get to the bottom of my soda quickly and it took a little bit before my waiter asked if I wanted it refilled. I didn't, but I appreciate being asked, just in case I do.\\n\\nFive star food.\\nFour star service.\\nTwo star wait.\\nFive star portions.\\nFour star ambiance.\\n\\nGO!"},{"name":"Community Smith","address":"866 W Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The service gets a one star!

Next came a basket of delicious little buns and three condiments: a smoky, oily pepper sauce that my husband loved and I did not, a citrus butter that I loved and my husband did not, and a small portion of escabeche (pickled vegetables). We did not order this, so it must be El Naranjo's equivalent of the complimentary chips and salsa basket. For our entrees, I selected Tampique√±a ($32) and my husband chose Chochinita Pibil ($22). My entree, the steak, was served with guacamole, refried black beans, a corn tortilla soaked in mole sauce, and pickled green peppers (rajas).

The salmon and p√¢t√© can be ordered separately as starters as well.\\n\\nMy one and only recommendation is as follows: SKIP HAPPY HOUR and try the amazing protein (YAY MEAT) dinner entrees and the aforementioned board. You can't go wrong with the pork belly, beef shoulder, or pork shoulder.\\n\\nCome back later for the happy hour drinks, duck fat fries, brussels sprouts, and deviled eggs.

First off, to enter the place you have to walk into a narrow hallway and past a beer/soda cooler.  The table we were sat at was in a small dining room which was decorated like any over the top tourist Italian restaurant.  Oh, you know what I mean, the poorly pained pastoral mural, the cheesy art work....\\n\\nI was with two office mates, we were quikly seated and served large pieces of Italian bread which had been left out for quite some time.  You know how one side of the slice of bread is stale and the other side seems perfectly fresh.  Well that is what we were served.  \\n\\nI ordered off of the dinner menu and settled on the vitello saltimbocca which was described as being served in a white wine and sage with prosciutto and mozarella...yeah right.  What I was served was veal marsalla.  I decided not to complain because I like Marsala as well as saltimbocca.....but here's the problem.  A marsala is made with Marsala wine and is not a simple brown mushroom gravy poured over tiny slices of medium well done veal.  The veal was badly over cooked and when I say it was a tiny serving, it was a 2-3 ounce portion of veal which was flavorless and tough.\\n\\nOur lunch tab was $86.00 and to be fair both of my companions enjoyed their pasta dishes.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, the waitresses were decorating for Christmas and one particular woman was hammering somthing into the wall 10 feet from where we sat.

Totally understand!\\n\\n2. Adam clarified the coffee refill charge is not a standard policy here at all. It was probably a miscommunication or an error made by my server.\\n\\n3. Adam invited me to go back and have a meal on the house. I had to kindly decline for two reasons. One reason is that I am not comfortable to get a free meal when the business is still young/developing. Second reason is that I don't think yelpers in general should expect these free meal privileges (even though they are really nice perks) just because they write an online review!

I couldn't really taste anything else. That was disappointing because the sides were so amazing.\\n\\nAlso, they charge extra for everything. Extra 50 cents for gluten-free bread and extra 50 cents for coffee re-fill. It was weird because my waiter brought out the bill to my table and it says \\"refill, 50 cents.\\" By the time bill was on my table, my table hasn't even asked for coffee refill yet.

The beef shoulder fell apart just with your fork, and the mashed potatoes and juices from the meat were so good together. We also shared sides of green Chile grits and collard greens.

I think one of the main reasons is because of the location.  It is on a main busy strip and taking a left into the place can be tough.  So with that said, I've never attempted to try any of the restaurants that has been at this location.\\n\\nI've noticed Su Su Sushi but once again didn't want to go but I heard someone talk about it at nail salon and how it's all you can sushi BUT they make it for as you order them (AWESOME)... especially when you are dealing with raw food, you don't want it just sitting there.. waiting for someone to come in and take it and you don't even know how long it has been sitting there.  So after hearing about it, I obviously went onto Yelp to see if there were any reviews and there was!  I love Yelp.\\n\\nSo my friend came over and we headed over to SuSu Sushi.  It was a monday night so it was pretty quiet . Our waitress was nice and attentive.  \\n\\nSo there is an la carte menu and then the buffet menu.  Not sure why you would go for the a la care menu because a lot of it is on the buffet menu.  From hot/cold appetizers, to maki, sushi, sashimi, udon noodles, fried rice.... everything all for $25/person!\\n\\nI've had my fair share of sushi in the past so I know when sushi/maki is made crappy or using poor quality items but Su Su Sushi seems to not be doing that (yay!).  We ate so much salmon, red tuna, white tuna sashmi, makis' seaweed salad that we were about to take a nap after eating.  \\n\\nI just hope that people make an attempt to try it out because I'm afraid either the quality may go down if not a lot of people go in or they may shut down, like the other failed restaurants.

My biggest criticism here is that they should cater their wine list to the dishes being served. Many of them don't pair well in my opinion. A few dishes will pair with 5+ of the wines, but other dishes, you will find it more difficult to find a pairing from their short menu. You can also of course purchase anything from their bottle shop and drink it there. They have a corkage fee, which makes absolutely no sense to me. Charging a corkage fee for a bottle brought from home, makes sense. But charging for something you buy from their shop, is silly. \\n\\nSERVICE: Excellent. This is where they shined.

Also, It's nice to have affordable choices and not be forced to buy a $10 hamburger no matter what ingredients you eliminate. You can order half original fries and sweet potatoe which is a dream. The milkshakes are hit or miss due to the variations of ways people prefer their shakes on top of who's making it.

Or if you're into sports they've got you covered with multiple tv's but not intrusive like most sports bars and how they have enough tvs you can't concentrate on what your company is saying.  The only dissapointment I've had here is the fries. The sweet potatoe fries are wonderful but this burger joint is a quintessential burger joint with the acception of decent fries. I've ordered them three times now and they are thin and mushy because of being saturated in the oil.

I tend to be indiscriminate in my food choices and will accept mediocre pizza most certainly, but I find, usually, Beau Jos to be extremely good.  \\n\\nI could give a rats ass about the service.  It is a college town.  You take what you get and suck it up.  I've had far worse service and much better service.  It is adequate usually and some servers are very pleasant if not highly skilled.

I've had one bad experience, where the pizza was not cooked fully.  I still ate it.  I like the thicker crust with the heavy outer edge.  I think the cheese used is good quality and the flavor of the sauce is not overpowering.  I like the balance - they do not oversauce their pizza which I despise.  \\n\\nI always get pepperoni & black olive and I eschew ridiculous toppings like goat cheese and artichokes - just more ridiculous ways to ruin a perfectly good pizza.  The pepperoni is of good quality and moreover - it is crispy, not soggy like some places give you.  I can name two places in town that sell pizza by the slice that slop the toppings on pre-cooked cheese pizza and warm in the oven - sacrilige!  Disgusting as well.  \\n\\nIf you prefer thin crust NY style or are a staunch Chicago style this falls outside of both those categories. It is also a starch lovers dream with the heavy outer crust.  \\n\\nI like it very much and my friend will tell you I seldom go on and on as I just have about any food items because I really am indifferent about food, not a foodie at all.  \\n\\nI may be delusional about this, it is possible, but I prefer to think this is truly good pizza.  If you concern yourself with quality service over quality food - pick a fancy restaurant and leave the seats for the rest of us.\\n\\nOh...and I never pay more than $10 for a small pizza, which feeds me 2-3 meals, which is $5/meal - a very good price if you ask me."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We have lived in the Austin area for 3 months and have been to more restaurants than I'd care to admit.

The bread broke easily when you bit into it, but it wasn't soggy or messy.\\n- Pecan stuffed dates wrapped with bacon with a maple drizzle: I, unfortunately, did not think to drag mine in the maple drizzle.

After reading excellent reviews on this place a group decided to try if out for a friends birthday dinner. We were seated outside at two tables back to back. That would of been totally fine but it seemed the table I was sitting at received mediocre service compared to the other (same server). I am a server at one of if not the busiest restaurant in Austin so I almost feel bad for even writing something negative about a fellow service industry worker. Maybe he was super busy (not sure since we were one of a couple tables outside) but I expected so much more as far as service. Food looked excellent but for the price I was let down. Nothing was horrible by any means but not WOW either. The Brussel sprouts we're my favorite. Now for the reason I am writing this review is when we got the ticket.  SO DECEIVING. It has a suggested gratuity of 20% but is added on the balance due. Leaving anything less than 20% would look like you are almost shorting the bill.  Since I am a server I was planning on leaving 20% like I usually do but I was not only confused looking at the ticket it just seemed wrong. I know not being able to add gratuity for larger parties SUCKS (since the laws have changed) but the way the ticket is printed is absolutely ridiculous. Surprised they can get away with it.

Not to mention most restaurants can be a little hard on your wallet. Then came Cobblestone. I am already bias towards BBQ and grilled meat, as I do not consider myself to be a light eater. I am thin, but don't feed me bird food. Cobblestone offers a great selection of grilled meats to satisfy my carnivorous taste buds. \\n\\nI visited with a coworker and she ordered the Crab Cake Burger while I settled on the Cobblestone Minis.

The wait wasn't long, and with warm goodbyes we were off to chow down at the office. \\n\\nThe Cobblestone Minis\\nFor the price of 2.99 (got the two-pack) my first thought was, how good can they really be being the cheapest burger on the menu? The answer sure surprised me. The meat was seasoned well and tender,  the bacon and tangy 227 sauce only enhanced the flavor explosion in my mouth. The patties were also well sized too, no all-bun-where's-the-meat? scenario. The portions were right for the price and I had no feelings of being ripped off or short changed for my order. \\n\\nThe Crab Cake Burger\\nI am a huge seafood fan and will eat anything that crawls, swims, or sits in the ocean. Taking a sample of my co-workers burger, left me utterly disappointed especially after the awesome experience with my burger. While I didn't have to question where the meat was in the mini, the crab cake unfortunately was more cake than crab. It too was seasoned well, but was more like crab flavored stuffing rather than a crab cake. If I could I'd retrieve my second Cobblestone mini from my coworker and hand her back the crab cake, but I'm sure like me, the mini is gone while the Crab Cake burger  is left on the plate like the one kid who didn't get picked for the baseball team. \\n\\nWill I go back?\\nAbsolutely, but I'd probably stick to the traditional grill items like hot dogs, burgers and pulled pork (coworker said it was amazing).

For side, we had the hash browns which were okay but would have been unremarkable without the really good house ketchup.\\nBottom line: With so many good to great steak houses in Atlanta, you would be hard-pressed to find a reason to seek this one out over the others."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Tilt is a nice little neighborhood burger joint.

I'm glad I did. \\nNever knew it before it closed, but I'm glad they reopened because I think they're swell! \\n\\nWhen you get within five feet of the place, you can smell the heavenly bakery scent of cookies, melted butter and tempting carbohydrates before you even open the door. It's a swift moment of peace. From there, you walk in and look right or left at the wall of glass showcasing difficult decisions, such as which treat you're going to get.  \\n\\nTheir pfeffernuesse converted a nonbeliever.

They're aimed to please. \\n\\nHere's a little off the beaten path fact: the bakery is a fantastic lunch-on-the-go location, for lines aren't a frantic insane asylum and the lunch specials are exactly what you're seeking before you run out of time on your break. \\n\\nYes, their bakery is good, but I like their sandwiches and soups almost more than the sweets (if that's even possible). The soups are filled with big chunks of vegetables, no matter which soup you choose. Their sandwiches are also great, be it tuna, chicken salad or pastrami, I've yet to be disappointed with their lunches. \\n\\nOverall, the German Bakery's location is easy to miss if you're not paying attention. It's next door to a cleaners, the big, skeleton mini-mall and Home Depot.  So, once you find the Dairy Queen, turn right on the inconspicuous street and you're there.

They have a wide range of foods and desserts to choose from, though the quality of those things is varying. \\n\\nCons:\\nTheir tea list could be more extensive considering they're a tea house and their food is always improperly seasoned. Sometimes their food is very bland (omuraisu) and sometimes it's so salty it's inedible (beef brisket kakuni). Their hojicha and matcha lattes are too milky. Ogawa makes a better hojicha latte and Lime Red Tea bar makes better matcha. Their regular green teas are weak and watery unless you get the hojicha. Their service workflow is absolutely horrible and it's made evident by the way they always have a long line but many open tables. The line is so slow that I often see people leave the line before ever making it to the register to place their order. They have two registers, but are often only using one. Their staff is incredibly slow at punching in orders and has asked me to repeat my order on numerous occasions. If there's any pastries in your order, the cashier will slowly grab each pastry order then return to the register to complete your transaction and serve the next guest. They should really learn from other cafes like Starbucks and start taking people's orders before they've made it to the register, or have the pastries be self serve like at Tous Les Jour. After placing your order you'll have a pretty lengthy wait even if you just ordered tea. The wait in the line and the wait for your order makes it impossible to make this a quick stop for tea to-go on the way to work.

I love Thai food, and most of the places around here are Thai/Chinese, with the general rule in asian cuisine being that when you mix cuisines, it usually isn't good (except for the Cuban Chinese places you used to see in New York City), and 2. Westerville ain't known for having any diversity in the local restaurants. Well, let me tell you, my excitement was NOT misplaced, as the owners of Thai Grille seem to have done what is necessary to generate good business in the culinary backwaters of central Ohio.\\n\\nThai Grille is located just off State Street, pretty much right next to Old Skool Skateboards, in the building where Michael's Pizza used to be. The space is very clean and bright, and the decor is fairly minimal. The tables and chairs look very ikea to me, but what I really came for is the food. One thing I should note is that the kitchen is open, which I like, because it is nice to see who is making your food.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a health conscious twist, but you wouldn't know it, because the food actually tastes good. I ordered  Gai Kra Prow, which is Basil Chicken. Actually, this was not technically on the menu - Basil Beef was, but I asked about it, and the waitress told me that the meats in any entree could be substituted for each other, so that is what I did. I also ordered some Tom Yum soup. The vegetables and mushrooms were all very fresh and tasty, and you could tell that they sacrificed 100% authenticity, for the sake of fresh ingredients, which I will not fault them for. The shrimp were huge. The basil chicken was done very well, I could tell that it was made to order, including some delicious eggplant and zucchini. I don't normally associate Kra Prow with eggplant, but in this situation, it was pretty good, and I would definately order it again. The sauce was delicious, and there was just the right amount of chicken. None of the food was too spicy for me, but then again, I have gone to eat with friends who are from Thailand and been able to hold my own when it comes to spicy food. One of my companions (Read: Mom) does not really have a high tolerance for spicy food, but she also ordered the soup, and enjoyed it, so that bodes well for Thai Grille's appeal to the general Westerville population. \\n\\nThai Grille also serves tea in small pots - which will serve one person. They also have Thai iced coffee, which I enjoyed, and Thai iced tea, which my wife enjoyed. The staff was very friendly, and I think it is good to note that we ate there during a snowstorm at lunch time, and there were several other people dining in the restaurant.\\n\\nThe menu is primarily in English, so customers do not have to navigate Thai names for the dishes, but my one gripe is that the menu is small. This is not necessarily a bad thing though, because Thai Grille may be the first experience in Thai cooking that some of its customers have, so it is probably a safe bet to keep the menu small. Plus there is a natural limitation on fresh ingredients, so I doubt we will be seeing softshell crab on the menu anytime soon. The upshot is that the menu is pretty easy to order off of, for those not familiar with Thai food.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience. Probably the best Thai I have had in the Columbus area, and definately worth trying out.  If this place was in New York, I'd probably give it 4 stars, but I will add a star for the location and the decision to not sacrifice quality for quantitiy when it comes to the menu. Hopefully they will be successful in this location, and provide a spark for increased food choices in Westerville in general."},{"name":"Muddy's Coffeehouse","address":"3560 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"While the food is pretty good and coffee is OK, I just can't get past the stench of body odor that I smell every time I'm at Muddy's.

I don't know about that.\\n\\nHere are the four items I sampled:  Beef ribs, pork ribs, brisket, and sausage.  \\n\\nI also tried the chipotle cole slaw and I found to be truly great.  The crunch of the cabbage with spicy and tangy flavors added a nice compliment to all the smoked meats.  But we're not here to talk about cole slaw, are we?  \\n\\nI have to say I was most excited about trying the beef ribs before coming here.  They are massive hunks of meat, but surprisingly they were my least favorite of the bunch.  They're also extraordinarily expensive, too, so caveat emptor.\\n\\nThe pork ribs were a nice balance:  Good smokey flavor, but not too fatty or dry.   \\n\\nThe winner of the day for me was the moist brisket & sausage.  This is some FANTASTIC brisket with great flavor--easily some of the best I've ever had in Central Texas.  The sausage, with a nice snappy case and a coarse grind was bursting with flavor.  Excellent.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked La Barbecue.  Like many other BBQ establishments, they do some things REALLY well and other things just OK.  Ultimately, though, this rating came down to price.  My party of two spent $40 for a modest amount of meat.  I know this is gourmet BBQ, but that's simply too much to stomach.

Nevertheless, it comes with a lot of syrup or butter depending on what you like. Either way, it's good to eat.\\n\\n- Fried chicken: This was the BEST part. I've had southern fried chicken before but none really compares to this. Why? The batter was crispy but the chicken was also tender but thoroughly cooked. It melts in your mouth and melds the flavor inside your mouth. Definitely give it a try.\\n\\n- Grits w/ cheese: Really good for a first try but it can be a lot. They give you a HUGE bowl.

She was too much of an inconvenience for the owner and his staff to handle. The service we received was absolutely below par from what they usually used to give us.

Even though I didn't get a steak (it is a steakhouse), my meal came to almost exactly $51, and for the most part was worth it.\\n\\nWhen I first spotted this Figs replacement, I thought it was just a bar/lounge. Hard to imagine where I'd get that idea considering the dark exterior, dimly lit interior and name \\"Met Club.\\"\\n\\nIt's definitely trying to be trendy. It has a wide open lobby flanked by a fireside lounge area, dark furniture, white cloth table settings and very, uh, formal waitstaff. It's like Flemings meets The Fireplace, only somewhat less fun.

I mentioned it's a steakhouse, so I probably should have ordered a steak, but I went with the sole because it had sundried tomatoes and raisins on it... I hadn't had fish in ages and the description sounded really good to me. It was great actually. My friend loved it, too. The only thing about the dinner that seemed a bit ridiculous was the price of the side dishes -- considering their size. At a really nice steakhouse (i.e. Mortons), you'll get a side dish big enough to share and still have leftovers. A side dish (about one cup) of vegetables -- edamame, carrots and baby corn (that's all!) -- cost $7. I could have made that for .50 cents at home.\\n\\nLast but not least, we ordered a baked berry/apple cobbler for dessert, that really did take about 20 minutes to bake. The waiter warned us about two desserts that would take 20 minutes (the cobbler and a chocolate lava cake) -- but he forgot to come back and check on us during dinner to see if we actually wanted to order one.

I ordered a glass of the red Chateau and we snacked on the olive plate. The olives were a mix of salty and spicy, which I enjoyed. However, since the olives had pits it made them somewhat hard to eat while having a conversation (this did not stop us--we finished the whole bowl). Along with the olives we had the Ox Tongue Sliders. The meat was so tender--it tasted like a piece of juicy brisket and the fried green tomato was just the right amount of juicy to compliment the toasted bread. I would definitely order these again. Also, we tried the coppa charcuterie plate. Although I'm a big fan of coppa and peaches, I wasn't too impressed with this--I was hoping for more coppa and less arugula. Next time we will try the Landjager because I want to try the beer jelly. \\n\\nFor my main course I had the mussels. They were cooked to perfection! I devoured every single one of them and used the bread to soak up the broth--yummy! I'm already craving these again. \\n\\nFor dessert we shared the Texas Summer Melon, which has ricotta, pound cake, raspberry, watermelon and honey dew.

It was difficult to decide on one because they all sounded so good, but eventually I ordered the Screaming Queen. The others in my party chose the Cold Remedy and Hot Toddy. Both were thoroughly enjoyed down to the last golden drop. Unfortunately, I found mine overly fruity for my palate. \\n\\nWhich brings me to the staff. They are super accommodating and pleasant. When I mentioned my distaste to the waiter, he quickly whisked the drink away without hesitation and suggested alternatives. I chose a classic Old Fashioned. I found it to be well balanced and the house cured cherries were delightful! After another round of the same, we called it a night. \\n\\nI can't believe I have been oblivious to this fantastic gem located just blocks from my house.

I went in to ask the hostess how long it would be, and she said ten minutes so we decided to stick it out. She was super friendly and it gave me a good vibe about the place. We actually ended up getting seated in about five minutes. I can't emphasize how great it is to have a hostess who is friendly as first impressions can really make a place. \\n\\nThe server quickly came to our table to offer us a drink (we both had coffee, standard diner fare quality). They only had cream and sugar on the table, I asked for milk and got a tiny little cup of it and didn't really want to bother the guy for sweetener as he was pretty busy. They really should just have sweetener on the table but no biggie. \\n\\nWe decided pretty quickly and the server was there to take our order almost as soon as we were ready. I'd previously gotten the trucker breakfast which was GREAT but just too much for me, so this time I went with the breakfast banh mi as it seemed like an interesting concept. \\n\\nFood arrived pretty quickly (I'd say ten mins tops). The banh mi was so different than your normal breakfast fare but was a nice change. I recommend getting it with the pulled pork - goes very well with the pickled veg. They throw a couple eggs on it too and it comes with hashbrowns. My boyfriend got the benny with bacon and seemed to really enjoy it. We were both full and couldn't finish all the hash browns (we're both pretty big eaters too) so good portion sizes. \\n\\nWaiter was very quick to bring our cheque when we were done and had the machine with him so none of that annoying waiting when you're ready to pay. \\n\\nOverall I had a great experience. I'm giving 4 stars as the venue is a little tight and you end up sitting a little too close to other tables. The prices were a tiny bit high for the type of restaurant but only by a dollar or two so no big deal. Other than that everything was great! \\n\\nThey move people through pretty quickly so don't worry too much if there are people in front of you!

But I don't think I'll be gambling too much at Hollywood Casino.  There's a difference between spending money you've set aside for vacation, and spending money that you need to pay bills.  \\n\\nThat said, Hollywood Casino has the same look, feel and sounds (ching-ching-ching) of a Vegas casino.  Not the elegance of Bellagio or Wynn, perhaps, but one of the lower-grade casinos like Rio, maybe.  I've certainly never seen a coat check in a Vegas casino, but I suppose that's a necessity in Ohio.  No Vegas casino has free, serve-yourself Coke fountains, either.  But I'm told the (alcoholic) drinks aren't free here like they are in Sin City; I didn't attempt to get one.\\n\\nI don't typically play table games, and I'm sure not going to start here, with $15 minimum bets.  That's ridiculous.  This is Columbus.  The minimums should be $5 at the most.  (I laughed when I walked past the high-limits room last night and noticed not a soul was in there.)  There are multitudes of slot machines (though if there are any with actual reels, I didn't notice), and plenty of video poker (my favorite game, though I didn't see any with progressive jackpots... lame).  There are a couple of electronic roulette stations.  I didn't see any of the more interesting electronic games you see everywhere in Vegas, like electronic roulette with a physical spinning wheel, Deal or No Deal, etc.\\n\\nI still can't believe Ohio voted to move the casino from its planned location downtown, to the barren west side.

The ladies accompanying me went right for the specialty drinks. I sipped the rita and it was right, but for taste and show order the Zenjen. \\n\\nStarting our meal we went with what seemed to be the buzz over here on yelp, and that's the triple fried duck fat fries and the bone marrow, as well as some salmon. Honestly, salmon was ok but nothing dazzling - skip. As this was my first leap into bone marrow I've not sure how I can honestly compare but I got to say it was delicious. If you're afraid - order it. As good as I thought the marrow was, the winner hands down were the fries. Not to jump ahead, but those fries were also the best food placed in front of us for the evening.\\n\\nWhile trying our best to not devour the fries we moved on to some veggies: fried smashed potatoes, cauliflower & wild rice casserole and glazed turnips. The latter two I did not taste, though neither with me showered me with praise of their glorious taste. Fried smashed potatoes were cute and the gravy was spot on. \\n\\nTo be honest, this much food between the three of us was working its way to full, but I went ahead and ordered the pork blade steak. The pork blade was massive so if you're not full by now you will be. The marinade was delicious and helped in my desire to eat everything but that pork was just ehhh.

The buffalo mozzarella was fabulous, very flavorful.  There were four very good sized scallops, which were cooked great.  The cured meats and oysters were also very good.  The pasta sampler we had was one lobster ravioli, which was exceptional and another small plate of shrimp risotto.  All of the appetizers were excellent.  The bread they bring out with the pesto type spread is really good, for anyone fond of pesto.  For an entree I decided to be adventurous and try the wild game trio, which was quail, pigeon, and one other game bird.  The dish was good, my only complaint was that since those birds are fairly small to begin with they were partially de-boned.  This made it somewhat difficult to eat them, although I was particularly happy with the quail.  The prior instance I had dinner here I ordered the lamb four ways entree, which was excellent.

Hops N Scotch is a bit more upscale than the neighborhood bar Coolidge Corner desperately needs, but it doesn't try to be anything it's not and does a great job at what it does.\\n\\nThere's a good-sized bar area that has about 30 beers on tap, plus a good selection of whiskey (hence the name). They have a drink list that includes abv and prices for all the beers, which is much appreciated. Beer prices are a little steep, but at least it's all good beer. You're not paying $5.50 for a Bud Light.\\n\\nWe began our meal with appetizers of mac & cheese and southern scotch eggs. The mac & cheese has thick, rich, almost grainy cheese, which I thought was delicious. The southern scotch eggs are not to be missed. I was skeptical looking at the menu, but the soft-boiled egg inside a puff of chorizo was the highlight of the meal.\\n\\nI had the hops burger with bacon and blue cheese. The burger was above average, though not by much. It seemed a bit too dry. All the ingredients were solid though and the burger comes with hand-cut fries.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is casual, but certainly more restaurant than bar. There is one large TV behind the bar and one or two smaller TVs upstairs where there are tables. I think they would be better suited to have all the TVs in the bar. It is also a pet peeve of mine when bars don't pay attention to what's on the TVs and while we were eating the TV upstairs was showing \\"America's Got Talent\\" rather than a baseball game or the U.S. Open.\\n\\nAll in all, though, I'm glad to have Hops N Scotch in the neighborhood.

Maybe it was the name..almost sounds like something you'd find in China or some other Communist country.  Or it might have been the parking--when I would drive by, it looked like a tight parking lot, and I hate small parking lots (once I gave it a shot, the parking situation turned out to not be so bad after all).\\n\\nAnyways, one day I finally ventured there...\\n\\nFirst off, let's go over what I like...  I like that they support other local Austin businesses.  For example, they have Buddha's Brew Kombucha and Straight From the Vine Sauerkraut...in fact, I think it was People's that introduced me to these wonderful companies!  In general, they have a wide range of interesting products and some brands and items that other places don't carry.\\n\\nI can't put my finger on the main thing I don't like, but I think it is the employees and the atmosphere.  Sometimes, I have gone in there, just wanted to browse and felt almost accosted by employees wanting to help me.  In a similar vein, one time I felt uncomfortable by an employee trying to force a chocolate tasting on me.  I just had a question about the sauerkraut, and then he was trying to get me to try the chocolate right next to it.  I really didn't want to try it and he *finally* let it go.  Then, at other times, I needed help, and the one person on the floor was busy for quite a while.  Then, there was the time I asked the Pharmacist an honest question, and he condescendingly looked at me like I was crazy.  His helper did try to subsequently help me, although he wasn't able to help much.  Maybe my question was off the wall, but I was still kind of hurt by the way the pharmacist responded to my question.  Which I guess comes to the gist of what I can't put my finger on...it's almost like the employees are sterile.  Maybe they're trying to be like mainstream pharmacies or a doctor's office, and that's just the type of people that work in those places, but the employees in the pharmacy section just seem a little cold.  Additionally, even when the employees have \\"helped\\" me, I don't know that I've found them that helpful (at least over finding where a product was located...I guess I am thinking more about informationally helpful).  I also kind of get the feeling that if you're just a normal person without a lot of money and have to choose your purchases carefully, they look down on you.  But if you're affluent, they'll coo over you saying, \\"Oh, you should get this and this and this...\\" knowing it is pocket change to the person, and they'll walk to the cash register without a second thought.\\n\\nThat brings me to my last point--they are a little pricey.  I know that needs to be taken with a grain of salt...maybe their brands are more reputable...you have to consider it is a local business...but I'm just saying...\\n\\nI hope People's changes my mind, because I like the concept of a health business that mixes the traditional with the alternative."},{"name":"Your Mom's Burger Bar","address":"1701 E Cesar Chavez St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Recipe for Hipster Heaven:\\n\\n*Hard to find location\\n*In East Austin, but all of the customers are white\\n*Divey decor\\n*Giant flat screen TV... turned to the Smithsonian channel\\n*Ashtrays on the table full of cigarette butts\\n\\nI kid, I kid... but yeah, I felt pretty out of place since I wasn't wearing skinny jeans.\\n\\nThe burgers here are good, but with all the 5 star reviews I was expecting mind blowing burgers.

YES PLEASE.  Soon enough, we were at the front, ordered all the sides, with 2 types of sandwiches and a 1/2 lb of brisket (which was totally a full pound), got our food immediately, paid, and sat at a super clean, covered, roomy picnic table.  And had the best sausage of my life (that's what she said). :)  Seriously, I hate sausage - I only get brisket - and this sausage was completely different and completely amazing.  Its a must try.  And the brisket was the moistest melt-in-your- mouth flesh I've had in a long time - amazing.

They occupied the corner space, above the skating rink, and down from the arcade.  They'd often be handing out nugget samples, and I enjoyed more than a few.  Super tasty!  I didn't really lament their departure, or really even notice for that matter.  It wasn't until years later, and the same-sex marriage controversy with the chain, that I remembered they even existed.\\n\\nObviously their grand opening was an \\"event\\".  Initially I visited the store a few weeks after it opened, and was greeted with 40+ cars in line.  I've only been through the drive-thru.  The line went fast.  Their customer service is top notch, and it's a nice touch that they ask for your name at the beginning of the order.  I think the prices are reasonable for high quality fast food.  So the sandwich, yes, it's very good.  Tasty fried chicken breast, with pickles, on a bun.  That's the standard version.  I recommend the following - upgrade to a multigrain bun.  Omit the pickles.  Add cheese + bacon, and dump the sauce of your choice on the sandwich.  Honey is a good choice, or any of their other sweet sauces (Polynesian, CFA sauce).  Optional: put the waffle fries directly on the sandwich as well.  I've had their nuggets too, and while tasty, they're tiny.  If you're going this route, get 12, and not 8.  You'll be able to finish them, I assure you.  For a drink, I like to go with an Arnold Palmer (with unsweetened tea).\\n\\nSo yeah, it's good for fast food.

So then why - after that exchange - did I decide to go to the \\"second best\\" barbecue in Austin (and quite possibly ZE WORLDO)?\\n\\nBecause, apparently, the barbecue master came from the #1 place (also in Austin, quite famous, starts with \\"F\\"). So, if you've got the best behind the scenes...it's basically numero uno, right? Well, that's the logic he gave me and - since I'd only be there for a little over 24 hours - I went ALL IN.\\n\\nThat type of \\"all in\\" brought me there about an hour before opening to gauge the line...which was basically non-existent. The truck is located in a gated area; and it was still locked. So, I perused the neighborhood. Long story short, there isn't much around there.\\n\\nWhen I returned (within 15 minutes of opening), I was about 3rd-4th. Now, that may seem lucky and/or this place \\"unpopular\\"...but - literally - within those buffer minutes, the line grew exponentially.\\n\\nEveryone was SO RIDICULOUSLY KIND. I chatted it up with both of the people in front and behind me. The person before me was a repeat customer! She spoke wonderfully of LB and the illustrious barbecue scene in Texas - setting hype mode into overdrive. (My knowledge of bbq is small: limited to places in the Bay Area, like Smoking Pig.) Just like the kind lady, the person patiently waiting after me was also approachable - turns out he was from the Bay Area too! More on that later...\\n\\nBecause, really, we're here for the food. Right before ordering, they offered samples of their brisket. Guys. Seriously. It melted in my mouth. MELTED IN MY MOUTH. *high shrieking* MELTED!!\\n\\nHad I taken meat from the gods? What was this delicious, smokey gift? How has this graced our Earth and why was I so lucky to have it now? I mean, I already knew what I was gonna order, but this just solidified it even further! And, that process happened fast and easily. (Again, everyone - staff included - was awesome.) My tray consisted of the essentials: brisket, chipotle slaw, potato salad, and dat white bread. As much as I would've liked to try everything, I had neither the wallet nor the stomach.\\n\\nHowever, I truly believe food brings people together. Turns out the fellow Bay Area-nite was waiting for his travel buddy, but he also ordered EVERYTHING. (Well, nearly everything - he didn't get the hot link.) And, nobody should have to eat alone; so, he kindly shared what I shall now dub \\"the ultimate meat tray.\\" Wowzahs! What a lucky, probably karmic, turn of events!\\n\\nHands down, their brisket is where it's at! I really wish I could've taken 3-4 lbs. of it home. The magic all came together with the white bread, slaw, and brisket! The beef rib, although humongous, falls off the bone easily with a plastic fork. Pulled pork is all right - a wee bit \\"dry\\" for my tastes. Lastly, the pork ribs are sauced perfectly and - like the beef - fall apart in all the right places.\\n\\nOverall, la Barbecue may be considered #2, but it's #1 in my heart...and stomach.\\n\\nAs they say, \\"Keep Austin Weird\\"...and \\"Keep Brittany Full.\\" No?

I ordered a pizza. Everything looked really delicious. As we sat on the comfy couches and waited for our pie, a lady across the restaurant from us started asking if we had girlfriends or wives. She was visibly intoxicated and I was surprised to see they served her more alcohol. We told her we didn't have girlfriends at which point she started calling us derogatory terms in Spanish. One of the workers in the kitchen began joking with her in Spanish about us. At this point I suppose she felt comfortable calling us these things in English, and she did. She pretty much let loose with a stream of hate speech on us while the staff did nothing but look uncomfortable, except for the guy who thought it was funny. Finally, I had had enough and told the guy she was with to get her out of there or it was going to get ugly. He didnt and started to verbally retaliate, the staff did nothing. Finally, when i had to start shouting at her, they asked her to not say those things or she would be asked to leave. She continued and they didn't ask her to leave. They chose to serve them, instead of making them leave as soon as the first F bomb was dropped. Yes, THAT F bomb. This was extremely hurtful for me. I have lived here for 10 years and have never encountered something like this in my neighborhood. And for one of the cooks to be colluding with this behavior is just out of the question. They didn't even say anything to the woman until I decided to make the environment more hostile, which is exactly why I did so. If they need money from people like THAT, they certainly don't need mine or anyone's money who stands against marginalizing other human beings. THE STAFF SHOULD HAVE ASKED HER TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY!

Not a bad line at noon, maybe fifteen people, waited maybe 20 minutes, no big deal. My decision on getting a beef rib was made for me when someone a few places in front of me got the last one. Which was fine, it saved me some money, and more than a few calories from fat, which I don't need, I can assure you.\\n\\nI decided to just go with the basics, couple pork ribs, slice of brisket, and some of the homemade hot sausage they serve. Order at the window, get your BBQ, (and sides) and move over to pay at another window.\\n\\nOutside seating, but it's covered, and there's shade to begin with anyway. The sausage was very good, not super hot, but it did have a little kick to it. There was a little grease towards the ends, but not so much it was a negative thing.

The ones I got had a heavy coating of it, in fact, so much that I was wiping some of it off. However, ribs were fantastic as well, and your tastes may vary, I just found I liked them better with less of the rub, which easily wiped away. Ribs were tender and meat came off the bone easily, also some of the better ribs I've had.\\n\\nThey have a a couple of sauces on the tables, a regular, and a spicy one. Both were good, and I used them about equal, but I think the regular would be the one I prefer.

Thank you for taking care of us Jade!"},{"name":"Rishi Sushi Kitchen & Bar","address":"114 N 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"My friends were always talking about this place because they are ramen fanatics and eventually I got the chance to try it. Walking in, the place seemed almost out of place in the downtown area on Long Street and 3rd with it's hip vibe and modern decor. There is a lower level and an upper level with window seating and tables. My friends were up on the upper level and as the evening got darker, the lighting up there can get super dark. On less busy nights, they might forget to brighten it up so just grab a waiter/waitress to turn up the lights! \\n\\nSo the first time I went, I had to try their ramen. I got the It's Gonna be Amazing ramen which is a spicy seafood ramen with well, seafood, and kimchi! Well that's certainly a twist. I forgot to mention that this place is a sort of...Asian fusion restaurant that likes to put an interesting twist on foods. We'll get to that later. The broth wasn't flavorful though not as a spicy as I would've expected, actually it wasn't now that I think about it but those with more sensitive tongues may think otherwise. One of my friends had the There's Always Tomorrow made with a beef broth. The broth wasn't as good or impactful as the mine. Now, if you're at a place with 'sushi' in its name, you gotta try the sushi. And so I did. When you look at the sushi menu, you have a right to be suspicious because an Asian fusion place that has a very simple sushi menu such that it says a cucumber roll has...cucumber (6pc) in it is not right. When the server comes around, ask them what exactly is on your sushi for it might not be what it expected! I love scallop so the spicy scallop roll appealed to me. I asked our server and she told me what it was made with, you know, scallop, cucumber, Japanese mayo, spicy sauce, and mozzarella cheese, all baked in the oven. Wait, cheese? Hold on what. She said yeah, it might be a bit strange but it tastes pretty good. So I went with it and what do you know, it wasn't too bad! If you don't like cheese, perhaps asking to remove it or just avoid it all together.\\n\\nThe second time I went, I went with the Salmon Sushi Panini appetizer, Wu Sah Salad,  and the Passion Fruit Cr√®me Brulee. The sushi panini was delicious! It's basically spicy salmon (tuna or crab) sandwiched between panko crusted rice patties. A nice twist on an onigiri. The salad was a wedge salad topped bacon, egg, bleu cheese, tomatoes and a wasabi dressing. Unfortunately the wasabi dressing didn't really do it for me. It had a nice kick but perhaps a bit too much. But if you love wasabi and bleu cheese, go for it! As the rest of friends finished their entrees, I had to wait quite a bit for the creme brulee to come out. It took a good 10 minutes after we were done eating even though I stopped eating quite a while ago (I boxed most of the salad) even though I asked the server to just bring out the creme brulee as I was ate the salad. Finally it come out and it was certainly very pretty. As we dug in, the presentation unfortunately wasn't up to par. The taste was very fruity as expected but the creme wasn't as solid as it should've been. It was somewhat liquidy and not too creamy, so that was a disappointment. \\n\\nLet's see, other things...the loaded fries were delicious, think cheesy fries but combine that with bacon, kimchi, and sloppy joe. Calorie inducing so share with some friends! Sometimes they get very fresh seafood in so ask what's on the menu, like oysters!

I explained that we would like to sit at a table and he told me to get up and proceeded to call a family over to sit at the table.

It wasn't the \\"orgasm in my mouth\\" as some Yelpers indicated, but the balance of lamb to sausauge, the subtlety of spice in the sauce, and hint of mint was good.  My entree, the Egg Ravioli, was overcooked, and had no real flavor aside from the red sauce that was drizzles over it. The presentation was sophisticated, but it fell flat.

Once we were seated, the service was friendly and efficient.  My friend and I started with the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer.  It was my first time eating them, and I guess I was expecting more of a cherry tomato (ignorant northern roots), but was pleasantly surprised by the near-eggplant-like taste of them.  Delish!  And then I ordered the fried chicken with a side of the squash casserole and mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese can hold its own, and the fried chicken was very well done, but the squash casserole really pushed this dish over the top and into the realm of heaven.  The squash just kind of melts in your mouth and falls apart into sweet goodness.  Really, as a fellow Yelper said, you can save this for dessert it's so sweet.

It's a refurbished warehouse and they definitely embrace that. The food is served on metal trays and they have shop towels instead of napkins (very environmentally friendly). I really enjoy visiting in the summer when they open the garage doors and let the rare (but appreciated) sunlight in! You order first and then find a table while you wait for your food. Last time I visited, we waited about 20 minutes to order. It's tough because you can't see the menu very well while you're waiting in line. They should definitely offer smaller menus to those waiting. I decided on the bacon cheeseburger with a large side of TILT fries and a Peanut Butter Oreo Pie Shake. The pie shakes are basically a piece of pie and ice cream blended together, so you can pick from whatever pies they offer that day. I absolutely loved the pie shake -- great depth of flavor and thickness. However, my brother got Apple Pie and the texture kind of resembled sludge... They have to make sure it's blended enough! For a family of three, the large TILT fries were PLENTY. We even took some home! The gravy was thick, hearty and had small pieces of pork which was a nice surprise. The bacon on top was perfectly crispy. The bacon cheeseburger was juicy and flavorful. I don't have a bad thing to say about the food at TILT! The only thing that bothers me is the price.

Sometimes, the chefs mess up on the amount of sushi ordered... and there is a charge for wasted food. \\n- Also, the servers have to manually put in the orders into the system, which understandably gets confusing especially when a variety of food is ordered. However, they screwed up many times. One time a good amount of sushi we ordered was never bought to our table, so we asked a server. She had the audacity to accuse us of never writing down the order instead of just putting a new order in or admit her mistake. Someone at my table got pissed from her lecturing us and asked her to bring our original ordering sheet so we can prove that we did order it... instead she bought the electronic one she made that didn't have the missing orders. When asked for the original again, she just shrugged if off and gave new ordering sheets to \\"reorder\\" the items\\n- Servers also rush you to finish eating after an hour, even if it's not packed in the restaurant.

Free parking around back.  Price for meal was inexpensive.

It was a rare day in February when it was actually nice to walk.  I had been intending to visit this adorable shop for quiet some time.  I love the color scheme of the place...pinks and sherbet lime is what comes to mind.  The d√©cor is modern and cozy.  Today, I came alone, so decided not to stay, but made a mental note to get my friend to join me at a later date.  This place is more than just a bakery.  There were espresso, wine and food menu  posted on the wall.  It was so dreamy walking in.  There was a gal behind the counter that had pink hair...she was so beautiful, I couldn't stop staring!  I was so mesmerized by all the treats behind the case and on the counter, it took me quite a while to decide what I wanted.  I thought I had heard that Petunia's was completely vegan and gluten-free, but some of the names or descriptions confused me a little.  I saw items that said cheese, so I had to ask the lovely lady if everything was vegan and gluten-free, and she said yes.  So finally made my selection. I got the German chocolate brownie and the Millionaire bar.  I also decided on a shortbread cookie in the shape of some animal.  I wasn't overly fond of the shortbread cookie.  Maybe it was a little thick and big.  Perhaps smaller would be more?\\n\\nAnyways, both brownie and bar were deliciously decadent! Or maybe that's decadently delicious?  But truth be told, I cannot wait to go back and sample more of their wares.  They have a punch card for cookies.  I have to go back and get more punches!  Oh, and the walk did me good, since I indulged in a wonderful treat that is Petunia's!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This was my first visit to Austin, and considering that you can't swing the proverbial cat without hitting a restaurant of some kind, I spent several months reading Yelp and other reviews to figure out places I wanted to check out so I could get a varied range of what Austin has to offer. I decided on the Salty Sow as my way of saying good-bye on my last night in town (which was Friday 11/8/13).\\n\\nFirst, if you are looking for ambiance (white tablecloths, a maitre d' -- things I also love); moderate to quiet levels of talk, or somewhere to take the family, then the Salty Sow isn't for you. (In fact, I saw someone come in with a child of around 10-12 -- very inappropriate because this is an adult restaurant and the language can get 'loose' if you know my meaning). \\n\\nHowever, if you want excellent food and a great take on \\"country\\" cooking or the so-called \\"farm to table\\" concept, then you might give Salty Sow a try. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, I went here on my last night in Austin, and I definitely recommend reservations as the place was packed that Friday night (I had mine). There are so many various rooms I lost count as the hostess guided me through the seeming maze, but we finally arrived in one area which was a little more quiet than the other rooms but still LOUD -- I think this room was called The Trough, or at least I'll call it that as this was the name emblazoned above the very busy bar. (And this is another thing, the noise level in this place is HIGH, so if that bothers you, you might reconsider your choice). But I ignored the noise and concentrated on a menu I'd been studying for a week or two. My suggestion is that you go over the online menu and get a general idea of what they have so you're not completely taken aback. \\n\\nMy server was sweet, took the time to explain a few specials to me (although the poor thing kept calling the lemon sole \\"lemon soul-a\\"), but she was on the mark with the wine suggestions, as well as honest about how big the portions were. (I nearly ordered the Charcuterie and Cheese Board for the appetizer and was told it had enough for 2+ people; since there was only me, and this likely would have filled me up, I passed). I started off with the Hogwash ((Don Q rum, watermelon, pineapple mint, and lime); great choice for me and hit the spot. As someone else mentioned, I, too, am a sucker for goat cheese, so if you love or even like beets, try the roasted organic ones with the mound fresh goat cheese and a pistachio vinaigrette with the whole pistachios as a part of it. Incredible way to start a meal -- not too filling but just enough. For the entree, I went with the seemingly popular candied pork belly, which was set atop fresh collard greens in the pot likker: WOW! The collard greens were cooked just right, tender, flavorful (reminding me of my mom and grandmother's home cooking), and I could even see bits of what was likely country ham cut into it for seasoning! I didn't try any other sides as I was unsure how big they would be, and besides, I had to leave room for the Bananas Foster Beignets, which is more than enough to share (unless you're not the sharing type LOL). I don't even like bananas and this dessert was such a treat, I dug right in -- I didn't finish the whole thing, but it is a wonderful dish that I highly recommend for an end to the evening.\\n\\nAlthough I had plenty of time to eat, the service was so fast that I had to call my cab driver and advise him that my usual 2 hours at dinner would likely be over in about 90 minutes (service was so quick in fact that my entree was at the table while I still had a few bites left of my appetizer). \\n\\nWould I return if I was in Austin again? Probably -- and would take a friend to share the Beignet! With so many different restaurants in Austin, you have a hundred choices. Again, check the menu and see if The Salty Sow might be up your alley."},{"name":"Koko Japanese Restaurant","address":"2053 Hastings St E","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"There aren't that many Japanese restaurants run by Japanese people anymore in the Lower Mainland, so it's always a surprise to find one. It feels just a tiny bit more authentic, but that's not the important part. The sashimi was fresh. The Koko Maki Roll was tasty and packed with real crab (not imitation), salmon, and tuna among other things. The seafood sunomono was also a good pick. They have both ramen and udon choices, not just one or the other, and a good selection of rolls and cones. The staff are all super-friendly and it's clear there are quite a few regulars when we went because the sushi chefs knew them by name. Definitely a hidden gem on Hastings and explains why they've managed to stay open at the same location for so many years."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Man, the reviews are all over the place on Contigo. Because of that, we had no expectations when visiting on Saturday night. Pulling up, my first impression - love the building. It fits the Austin aesthetic very well and they are smart to create a mostly patio style venue. There was a bit of a wait but it didn't matter. We ordered the two smoking gypsies, a moscow mule and a classic hot toddy and huddled around the fire. Nice touch adding the blankets. We drank, chatted and just generally enjoyed ourselves. Interesting people watching for sure - there was a crazy mix of people at this restaurant that I expected to only see the east side cool kids at - seriously, there were kiddos, old folks, super cools and not so cools all existing harmoniously together. Love it. \\n\\nAfter about a 25 minute wait, we were sat inside and experienced our only disappointment of the evening. I do believe that the waitress did not realize we were her table. We waited another 20 minutes or so to be acknowledged and brought water. Finally, our waitress showed up and was very present for the remainder of our time. Good service = all is forgiven. \\n\\nWe proceeded to drink a couple Mexican monks, Texecutioner, espadin tea, all perfect drinks. The additional of the variety of toddies are a brilliant idea. Especially for the couple of days a year that you actually want a warm beverage in Austin. Seriously, this place gets props for good drinks.\\n\\nProceed to the food. Our favorite of the evening was the pork liver p√¢t√©. The honeyed eggplant paired with it was genius. And I don't even like eggplant. I want to eat it all again, and again, and again. Can you have p√¢t√© for breakfast? White beans with duck fat (ooooh yeah, I said duck fat) - awesome. The fried green beans were lightly fried in a tempura batter and nicely seasoned. We also enjoyed the brasaola very much. We also had the meatballs (loved the fresh pasta) and the rabbit and dumplings (maybe our least favorite of the evening). \\n\\nWe are going back. Actually. We are going back tomorrow night. More p√¢t√©!!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I could write an entire review just about the cocktails!

I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to home fries as well, and I love the home fries here.  The home fries aren't an afterthought here.  And if you're a fan of corned beef hash, you MUST try it here. It is freshly cut and mixed perfectly with onions and peppers.  It's a small place in a typical \\"street car\\" type diner setting, but it's worth the wait if all the tables are taken.

However, the food was lacking in every way shape and form.

There was no flavor in the very soupy very thin hollandaise sauce. The yokes in my eggs were broken .. And the homefries appear to be the frozen pre prepared kind, not the kind you would hope to find at a hometown cafe, maybe the only thing on the plate that may have had flavor, but again so much sauce it just tasted like buttery water. My husband got the country fried steak and eggs.. Also received cold and flavorless. Country fried steak should be bursting with flavor. Steak should be pounded out dredged in buttermilk then SEASONED in flour. This was just a slab of steak dropped in flour and fried,... Over fried. Overcooked and flavorless! Grits were under cooked and extra pasty.. We also ordered a pancake to share. The simplest thing to make didn't even come out to us until after they had already cleared our plates. VERY disappointing, it was just barely warm enough to melt the butter. Since I barley ate my breakfast soup, we were hoping the pancake would make up for it. Again, nope, Just add water Maybe?..

The owners make sure their ingredients are all fresh and do not compromise that for any cost. All appetizers fresh too.. ground up chickpeas for basil hummus and all deserts made by Anka from scratch daily! Complimentary bread and olive oil too! The place also gets a thorough cleaning every Sunday night and daily upkeep. Being a seasoned server these are some of the things I was looking for when searching for work and I found that and great people as a bonus! Now I hear people talk about the price of pasta .. but making fresh pasta everyday and all the sauces and toppings is definitely more work then most think it is. Trust me I was a skeptic when I first interviewed..But watching what goes into it I just want everyone to know that it's not Easy! No one complains when they spend a fortune on sushi w a little piece of fish rolled in rice or Chinese food or drinks that cost more then a meal at Twyrl! And you never leave hungry! Also wine and beer prices are best I've seen ANYWHERE! I've paid more for a couple cocktails or beers in the area then a whole bottle of wine at Twyrl. Plus for those that have kids I know you might have bought these LPS toys for 20 plus dollars when you know they're made in China and costs pennies to make! We could go on and on about what is cheap yet we pay so much for .. but when writing reviews about Twyrls pricing, ask yourself who pays for the employees that work there , rent, electricity , gas , heat lamps to run on the patio.. if you were just paying for pasta you'd go home and make it, same for a steak or burger .. a dining experience is what you pay for and you at Twyrl are getting all fresh handmade ingredients.. I'd pay for that over most meals I pay for at establishments! I love my job and our guests and that's why I decided to write this review. Wish this place was a little closer to home but regardless if I am here in the future, I hope this place stays forever as they deserve all the kudos for having an establishment I find worthy enough to drive all that way.

Everywhere I turn is a tasty piece begging to come home with me; it's like being at the Humane Society if only the pups were pies, cakes, brownies, and cookie sandwiches.

Red Wagon is a wonderful diner that I had to try out after watching that show on the Foodnetwork which is one of my favourite shows BTW. I drag along my roommate who is off today to try it out and I had their so called signature dish, Pulled Pork Pancake Sandwich with maple syrup infused with Jack Daniels rum. I had to say, I love the casual diner experience and atmosphere and the food is good. My roommate is impressed with his burger and salad as well. I was blown away at the richness of the Pulled Pork Pancake sandwich. I love it especially the sweetness of the maple syrup combined with the salty and spicy pulled pork and with the tang of rum as an aftertaste.\\n Only thing I was not impressed was with the girl server or busperson that showed us to the table. She was not smiling or friendly at all. The male server who is our table server however was much nicer and friendlier. Overall, I think the place deserve a recommendation and hey, they got featured in the Foodnetwork show, so they are good enough.

She knew the menu inside and out, and answered every question with a smile and a detailed answer.\\n\\nTo start, we each had the lamb grilled pita.  The portion was so large, it could have been shared or would make a nice meal with a salad.

I asked for the potato salad in place of the side that came with it.  The potato salad alone is worth coming back for.\\n\\nAnd then we had dessert.  O-M-G.  The MOST delectable home made small donuts with a wonderful mascarpone cream topping, homemade butterscotch sauce, and fig jelly.  We are not big dessert eaters but I'm glad we opted not to share one order.  They were outrageously delicious. \\n\\nThe other really neat thing was that the front windows which look out onto Tremont Street actually fold open so that when the weather is nice - as it was the night we were there - they can be left open and it's as if you are sitting out in an open air bistro.

I've never had such a conflicted dining experience.  Service was excellent and the quality of the ingredients was fantastic, but much of the taste was bland and what's up with the terrible mish-mash decor?  I usually don't care about the decor when it comes to food (even though I studied architecture), but L'Atelier actually had decor that bothered me.  \\n\\nBack to the food.  The bread is good-- nice ratio of crisp on the outside to soft on the inside.  It was only slightly sourdough, which is what I like, but my friend thought it should've been either sourdough or not sourdough, rather than something in the nether region.  To each her own.  We started with the mussels.  The PEI mussels were fantastic-- juicy and plump.  The spicy tomato broth on the other hand was boring and didn't even complement the flavor of the mussels.  Not spicy either.  We started to sort of like it when we got to the bottom of the bowl... For the main I had the duck.  The portion was good with leg confit and duck breast along with sides of farro, chard, and fig.  I requested medium rare for the duck but it came only barely medium (i.e. overcooked).  Not tender enough and way too much chewing required in addition to the nonexistent duck flavor.  However, the skin was great, crisp and tasty.  See what I mean about the conflict?  The leg was plenty flavorful, but then almost too much.  I did like the farro with cherries quite a bit, as well as the fig, but then the chard was way undercooked and required even more chewing than the duck.  My friend had the filet mignon-- it was an excellent cut of meat in terms of tenderness, but then there was the lack of flavor again.  A good cut of meat doesn't require much seasoning, but somehow they took all the flavor out of the steak and thus made it a necessity to dip it in the sauce.  How does that happen??\\n\\nIn sum, definitely not a 5 star restaurant and for me, not worth going back to."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Brisket is fantastic.

I think it's getting popular enough that a queuing and seating system is overdue. A BUS (literally, like a tour bus?) of people showed up today and staked out most of the tables, clearly having a couple people hold their spot in line while they secured seats. We were among those who showed up an hour before the bus arrived and were actually standing in line, so when we got our food, it was really difficult to get a seat. Yet, you had all of these people sitting at the tables with nothing in front of them. \\n\\nSad to say this might be the last time I go back. This is a great spot to take friends visiting from out of town, or to fill that craving for melty beef, but unless they fix the seating and line issue, it's become a hassle. Come on, people.

We were awkwardly place right in front of the bar; it is nice to have the bar close so your drinks will come quickly, but hearing all the glass breaking and clinking killed the ambiance a bit.  But the food mostly lived up to the rave reviews.  I was lucky to try the Charcuterie special, the duck fat fries, the Brussels Sprouts Caesar salad, and the Bacon and Gruyere bone marrow as my entree.  Quite frankly, the fries were nothing special; delicious but not out of this world. I have had duck fat fries before, the only significant thing about these fries that it came with a delicious Bearnaise sauce and a runny egg on top.  The charcuterie special was excellent; it came with classic pate, a \\"greek\\" pate with olives and red peppers, which gave a sour bite to contrast the decadent meat.  It also came with a nice herb goat cheese in which the herbs did not overpower the natural flavor of the cheese.  The rest of the plate included cheddar from Wisconsin, soppressata salami, and your typical pickled vegetables, nothing much to write about those components of the plate.  For a place specializing in meats, they had a quite excellent salad.  The brussels sprouts were cooked nicely, and added a hearty factor to the salad; the Caesar dressing tasted truly home made, I could have sworn they made it from scratch, but forgot to ask because I was enjoying it so much.  \\nSadly, the most disappointing dish was the one I was looking forward to the most, the bone marrow.  It looked quite appetizing when our waiter arrived at our table, but I realized as I was eating that there was very little marrow in the medullary cavity.   I tried to \\"scoop\\" out as much as I could, but all I could feel was my spoon sliding against the spongy bone inside and got little marrow.  I mostly ended up with at most 2 teaspoons total of solid marrow from both halves with plenty of liquid fat to sop up with my bread.  Also, I could not distinctly taste the Gruyere or bacon, the melted marrow of the bone may have overpowered the fixings, but It was quite tasty, nonetheless.  It may have been that I was the unlucky customer who received the bad femur that did not have much marrow in it, but I am curious to see if it was a mistake or a reoccurring problem.\\n\\nDespite the unsuccessful marrow, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant and would love to return to try the candied pork belly!

It came highly recommended through Yelp and friends in Austin, so I had high expectations. But the end result was just meh.\\n\\nWe were seated on the cute patio on a Thursday night, in front of a massive industrial fan blowing in our faces. The waitress mentioned she couldn't turn it down any, so we waited for a table next to us to clear and asked about moving out of the wind tunnel. After gathering up our things and moving over, the waitress came back out and turned the fan off. Ummmm. Awkward. On to the food.\\n\\nFor starters, we had a poutine app special. Instead of fries, it's smashed yellow roasted potatoes, topped with cheese, brisket and sour cream. These were decent, but the sour cream was a bit much. The cold mixed with the brisket was kind of off putting, and what's poutine without gravy?!  For a main, I tried ordering the \\"crispy chicken thighs\\" but I referred to it as \\"fried chicken thighs\\". (Rewind a minute: I discovered Salty Sow by searching \\"fried chicken\\" in Austin, TX. First mistake.) Turns out, these aren't fried, but grilled. So I ordered the crispy pork belly and asked to swap the collard greens for another vegetable. Heads up, there are no substitutions on this menu. Your only option is to ask for something without a side, and order another side off the menu. I understand food costs, but can I really not swap some collard greens for carrots? The pork belly was *fine*, cooked well but could use a glaze instead of a broth-like sauce. And the collard greens are probably fine if you like collard greens, but I just don't. \\n\\nSalty Sow seems like a place I'd like to go for happy hour cocktails and snacks.

Casablanca isn't reinventing the burger wheel, they just do the best they can with some very traditional components. What basically reads as a very traditional, almost cliched burger (bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato) is surprisingly delicious. Sometimes you just can't account for that \\"it\\" factor. Even upon arrival, the burger is mostly unassuming; the cheese is kind of melted, the lettuce and tomato sort of look okay, and the bacon appears to be mildly crispy but unspectacular. All of that changes during the first bite, which yields a ridiculous amount of juiciness in a way that I've never seen before. Post 390 was similar, but that lasted for about three bites before turning into a dry oasis of beef. I lambasted them for not letting the meat rest a few minutes before serving, and I could almost criticize Casablanca for the same issue. Except of course, this burger is juicy down to the last bite, some lost on the plate, but most contained in the burger. And that's a good thing in my book. (book pending)\\n\\n\\nThis is a culminating example of a burger being on a menu just for the sake of having a burger on the menu. Inspired by classic Mediterranean Cuisine, this could have been their chance to do something differently. Maybe a lamb burger? Muhammara? Olives? Feta? Something off-the beaten-burger-path might have appreciated, but it's a classic version and lucky for them, it's friggin' divine. Although not perfect, it's juicy and salty and beefy. Good enough for some, and mostly great enough for me, while still being a shade over the requested medium-rare, the burger remains unaffected. Which is another point I have to stress; I've been critical of over-cooked burgers in the past, but isn't the entire point to have it taste good?\\n\\nThe fries are fair, golden and crispy but needing salt, which I quickly remedy myself. Isn't it funny how salt almost always fixes everything? A decent tomato and not-so decent piece of lettuce top the burger as does the curious bacon. Curious because it's not quite crispy, not quite chewy and definitely not bad considering its lack of crunch. It's an excellent Apple-wood smoked bacon at that, and even though it isn't cooked up to par, the flavor is impeccable. The cheddar is also fair in the melting department, because it's so thick it never really has a chance to fully melt onto the burger. But again the flavor is the saving grace, any thinner a piece and it would be melted but would also probably be lost in the burger. The thicker the cheese, the more flavor it imparts, add that to the juicy burger, the smoky bacon and we have a winner. At $13 it feels more like a $9 - $11 burger, but we're arguing over a couple of dollars so who the hell cares. While there are some technical issues in the way of under-seasoned fries, less than crispy bacon and not quite melted cheese, the flavors and juiciness of the burger make it noteworthy. Even if I have my own desires for it to be fancier than it probably needs to be, the burger at Casablanca is damn good, and should not be overlooked."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"2855 NE Town Center Dr","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"Great food, fast and friendly service and clean tables.

I noticed the same thing...   a mess...  almost every table dirty...  garbage station... dirty...   condiment / drink section... dirty.   And...  my time in there...  same thing.   There are like 5-7 people in front of the service line... one person right next to the check out person was only responsible for asking if I wanted a drink or chips and salsa...   could not the register person ask that question and reach back for some chips, and ask the salsa person for a cup of salsa while getting a cup out while waiting for said salsa?  After I had finished my meal, and the wife was putting on her finishing touches, a guy came by and cleaned up a table near us (just one)...   but there had been 2 other people in and out of that spot before that happened.   Yes, it's a fast food type environment...  but I know I just paid a higher than A&W price for that food.. and it usually looks a lot better from the window than this place.   I think a little more time/money spent on the dining area would go a long ways for people having a better experience here (and the downtown location).\\n\\nGo back again...  if the lines dropped and I was ok with the state of the dining room ... yes.  The food is decent.   But...   those opportunities may be few and far between....   2 1/2 to 3 stars."},{"name":"Green Lemongrass","address":"1086 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I had never tried sugarcane before, so I went for the spring rolls and chopped shrimp on sugarcane vermicelli bowl.

Gitto's Pizza was a welcome experience. I was looking for a pizza place and Gitto's was the best-reviewed on Orange Ave. It lived up to its lofty expectations. The pizza was superb: bursting with flavor and the right amount of crispness that I love in a pie. Their slices are enormous for $4 and I was full after just one. They offer a garlic knot with each slice, which was also very delicious. I also sampled the mild wings, and I didn't think they were anything to write home about. My wife also didn't like the gluten-free pizza, calling it bland, uninspiring, and tasteless.\\n\\nMOOD: 5 stars. I loved the atmosphere. It truly made me feel like I was in Brooklyn at a pizza shop. The ordering is done downstairs and then there is pretty cool seating upstairs replete with a New York theme. I'd never seen such a hole in the wall place that transformed into an actual restaurant in Orlando, so I was fairly impressed. The one strange thing is that the restroom is located in the kitchen. You have to pass directly through where the pizza is being made to access the bathroom. It's a little odd but if there are no health code violations being broken, it's A-okay with me.\\n\\nLOCATION: 5 stars. It's on Orange Ave between Church and Pine streets, so it's absolutely in an accessible location easy to see and spot. We parked in a nearby parking lot on Church Street and it cost us $1 for an hour. I didn't mind the short walk. I love being in and around downtown, so just about any restaurant located there is in prime real estate in my opinion.\\n\\nSTAFF: 5 stars. The staff was very kind. They exhibited patience when taking our orders, they made friendly jokes, they gave us a bevy of options when we were unsure of what to get, and did all with smiles on their faces.\\n\\nVERDICT: 5 stars for a great time at Gitto's.

I wasn't going to front a couple hundred dollars to play some games I probably would have just lost at anyway.  So unless you just want to blow a bunch of money on slot machines, there's not a whole lot to do here if you're going to operate on a small budget.  Also, beer here was insanely expensive.  A Budweiser was $5+, and I don't think they had anything local on tap.  Other reviewers have mentioned the poker room.

They were out of that dish and our second choice the blackened shrimp and grits (yes we were splitting a dish, and yes I know that is the bane of every servers' existence but we couldn't take any leftovers since we weren't going home), so third choice it was! Eggs Benedict. It was an interesting take on the traditional: poached eggs atop tomatoes, sliced turkey deli meat and half a hoagie roll with hollandaise sauce and \\"potato pancakes\\" which looked more like flattened tater tots but were better than expected. Overall, a decent dish but nothing ground breaking. The server was attentive and pleasant, clearing plates as needed to keep the table clutter free.

It is a very nice little spot, not too dressy or casual. The menu board outside alerted us to their lunch specials. I highly recommend their lunch specials. For under $8 you get a giant platter of food with about 6 different portions of amazing homemade Italian food.  My mom and dad each got the special which consisted of a tasty frittatta, something delicious called vitner's sausage, assorted pastas, lasagne, and eggplant. It was all good and each platter could have probably fed 2 people. There were leftovers a plenty.\\n\\nI wish I'd gotten the lunch sampler. Instead, I got chicken fettucine alfredo. Normally I shy away from alfredo sauce, finding it to be too heavy, overly processed, etc, and I wanted to try it from a more authentic italian place. It was good, I just liked everything else on the table better. The chicken was lightly breaded and there were generous chunks of it, as well as a hearty serving of broccoli. As most cream sauces, it doesn't reheat very well so either share, or be content to eat the grainy portions afterwards. You could probably add some milk to reconstitute it but we didn't have that luxury in the hotel room.  This could feed 3 people easily, with plenty of chicken to go around.\\n\\nI think my brother's dish won the day. He got spagetti bolognese, which sounds simple, but it was perfect. The sauce was flavorful, the meat  was a blend of various kinds of meat, ground to a very delicate texture that almost melted in your mouth. I kept stealing bites of his, and when it came to leftover night, his reheated the best and was the most sought after. Good pick, little bro. Even his 16 year old appetite couldn't finish off more than half, so again, something like this would be easily shared.\\n\\nThe service is great, the servers are friendly and will answer all your questions and help you pronounce anything.

I love Caribbean cuisine and have found some of my best dishes at local hole in the wall family owned Jamaican joints around town, dining on huge portions of Jerk Chicken with rice and peas, plantains and cabbage and my all time favorite of Oxtails w/ Brown Gravy. Therefore, I was intrigued to see what Entice-A had to offer. I decided to meet a friend there for dinner on Friday. \\n\\nWhen I walked into the restaurant it wasn't what I expected. It was definitely more of a bar/lounge than your traditional restaurant. I had perused the menu a few days prior to going to the restaurant. When I arrived, the server told me that they had a special of $5 martinis and a small selection of $5 Tapas. While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I ordered the Pineapple martini which tasted very tropical. I then ordered the Jerk Chicken Dings which ended up being plain fried chicken wings with barbecue sauce as a side. I hardly tasted any jerk seasoning on the wings and thought the barbecue sauce took away from the whole Caribbean vibe that I was expecting. I next ordered the Passion Fruit martini which was just as fruity and tropical as the Pineapple one. \\n\\nAfter my friend arrived, we ordered the following Tapas dishes: \\n\\nBraised Short Ribs with curry rice. This was the most Caribbean inspired out of all of the Tapas dishes we ordered. The short ribs were very tender and well seasoned and the curry rice gave the dish that island twist that I was expecting. \\n\\nCurry Chicken Wings with a side of mango salsa. Not good. They were just plain fried chicken wings again with no curry flavor. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the Crab Cakes which he enjoyed. I tasted the last bite of the dish and thought that it was well seasoned and tasty. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the Curry Tofu with Rice. This was his first time eating tofu. The curry sauce was more on the sweet side. The white rice pilaf was bland though. \\n\\nMy friend ordered a Mojito which was not good at all. It tasted like the drink was a mix of Club Soda and Sprite. He returned the drink to the server. \\n\\nOverall, we really liked only two of the dishes. \\n\\nSummary: Good happy hour or late nite spot. Great for large groups. Food is not authentic Caribbean. The Martinis are great. The service is good. However, they were real slow bringing out the dishes. The server kept apologizing and saying that the kitchen was backed up. They definitely need to improve. If you're in the mood for good Caribbean I would NOT recommend Entice-A.

It was so unpleasant eating in the bowl. \\n\\nNext the broccoli is in GIGANTIC pieces and barely cooked, and you only get a fork.

We're all about new grub and if the food is good, why not?! I was just excited to get out of the hotel and venture!\\n\\nAssaggio is located on Prince street right in the heart of the Italian district. Rolling up to the joint you know its going to be good on the inside! Little red awnings and wooden panel give a very authentic Italian feel. When you enter, you go through a narrow hallway, pass a steep staircase going downstairs and then you're seated in a jaw dropping dining area. Low lit lights, Roman looking statues, mural ceilings and walls giving the feel of an old century European town. This place was pretty! The staff was alright. They were nice and cordial but didn't really take time to make a memorable experience. At one time, we ask for some recommendations as the menu was pretty extensive, but it didn't seem like the server wanted to give us some suggestions. No worries, we decided on things anyway. Here's what we got:\\n\\nWe got the Elk Cove Vineyards, 2011 Pinot Noir bottle for $50. To me, I wasn't a big fan about it. Although I got the cherry notes in flavor and scent, it was more of a tart flavor. The finish was more sour than smooth and savory.\\n\\nFor dinner, I got the Three Mushroom Risotto for $16.95 and added chicken to it for an extra $5. Risotto rice, cooked with shiitake, portobello and button mushrooms. This was THE BEST risotto I've ever had.The arborio rice was perfectly cooked al dante, not too creamy but certainly not dry. The mushrooms really took the dish to new heights with its earthy flavor. I HIGHLY recommend this dish!!\\n\\nListen, if you're in Boston's \\"Little Italy,\\" you really need to try this place out.

I've heard nothing but great things about this place and their selection of beer. I would gladly give them 5 stars based on beer selection alone. I'd then take away a star because price is a bit excessive. I'd probably give it back because of access...i mean damn...130 taps is insane...GREAT JOB ON SELECTION. But then I'd take it away again because really...do we need that many options...at once? I mean with 130 taps, it's not so much of a selection as it is just beer en masse! But then I'd take away another point because honestly, it's not the easiest place to get to. I imagine if you worked in the area, it'd be a great lunch place and it is within walking distance of several parking garages but when I think of all the cozy bars, tap houses, and pubs in suburbia where you can park just outside the door and not have to worry with long drives home (especially after a drink or two) it doesn't make as much sense. Sometimes a better option than 130 taps is the option to just walk home :) Anymore, there are plenty of places with better accessibility that have upwards of 16-50 taps...grant it...it's no 130 taps but location location location! So here we stand at a 3 star review...but then there's food, that will earn a star...maybe two back? \\n\\nNot so fast...the menu sounds amazing. It sounds like it will really knock my socks off with lots of little plates, appetizers, burgers, international food, and expensive main courses. But then...I turned to my Yelp friends to guide me on what to try. What I find is a community torn on mediocre food...I'm always a sucker for the burgers...but I had to pass after multiple yelper's disgraced their burgers. So rather than spend a fortune on the steaks and pasta dishes, I stepped back and thought I'd spend my money on beer...after all, I know it will be good! I settled for just a chicken finger basket. What I found there was the foundation for losing another star. Tenders that were a deep, dark mahogany color...and smoky tasting...simply because someone in the kitchen thought they could keep frying chicken in the same old oil that they've been using for far too long. This is my biggest peeve with chicken restaurants...too many places try to get one more batch out of that oil and it always backfires...and as busy as they were that night, I doubt they changed that oil anytime soon. We also had spaghetti, pizza, fish and chips, and poke tuna. All of which were mediocre at best and some just meh... The poke was best, but honestly, given it's surrounding entourage it wasn't hard. It would be the equivalent of what you could get at a local grocery store...just with better presentation.\\n\\nThe service was a spectacular 5 stars. She was attentive and informative and prompt. The beer and the waitress were the stars of the show. I'm not trying to destroy this place, but in all honesty, it has an identity crisis that I could liken to it's inconsistencies. It wants to be a sports bar but it's full of families and young couples on romantic dates...so there are kids screaming, sports blasting, and little Johnny and Sue trying to snog in the dark corner. Meanwhile, the menu is bar food, family friendly, and high end American fare, but also international swagger...you can't possibly be great at one thing when you're trying to be everything. It's just as confused and awkward as the crowd that is mingling together. It's 130 beers when all you really want is 1...or 2...or 3... I get this business plan, I do, and I'm sure there are people who will sacrifice quality for quantity and variety. If you're trying to please a crowd of people who might get closer to trying all 130 beers in one sitting, then by all means...this is the place. It'd be a great place to go and watch sports with a crowd for that reason. However, for families or Johnny and Sue...please, for the sake of your taste buds and your wallet and your chances of a second date...go elsewhere. This place just has too much going on."},{"name":"Dimassi's Mediterranean Buffet","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I've been wanting to try Dimassi's for a while but it never passed my Official Buffet Rules until yesterday. Rule #1 is if the parking lot is empty; keep driving. No crowd means no food turnover so you don't know how long its been sitting there.\\n\\nWith the rain coming down, at least a dozen cars finally were enough to convince me that I should give it try. Little Rooster and I sorted out the good from the bad; all three plates worth. Is that Aljazeera on the flat screens? \\n\\nAcceptable fare included the salads, Makjuba, Moussaka, and the Falafel. The stand outs in my opinion were the Kabob Chicken and the fresh pita bread. On the lower end, the Hummus was a let down. It had the look of the strangest Gelato; the flavor matched its appearance. I was wishing for some Out To Lunch Green Chili Hummus from HEB.\\n\\nI kept thinking while sampling the dishes that the flavors were kinda moderate with no real punch especially in the Garlic department. Desserts rounded out the experience and would satisfy any sweet tooth this side of a South Austin Airstream with a cupcake on top. When comparing other local buffets; Dimassi's needs some help to really compete with the big boys like Buffet Palace. I'm rounding up to the 3 star realm as little Rooster enjoyed his lunch.

It's tucked in a small business complex right outside of the Highlands. It's not off a busy street with no signage. I'm not complaining because it makes it more of a foodie retreat, safe from the chicken fingers with ketchup eating fan club.\\n\\nSafe to say Star Provisions didn't food poison anyone this time as last year when I took the gf to Bacchanalia for her birthday it concluded with the most expensive vomit money can buy. The setup is pretty nice inside with a kind of weird outdoor seating. The outside seating is right before you walk in so everyone gets to see you chowing down coming through. The seating outside is in the business complex hallway. The inside almost looks Identical to Bacchanalia. The food is also comparable to Bacchanalia at a fraction of the price. So if you're thinking Bacchanalia this is a great step up to get a feel for if you would like it. \\n\\nThe menu filled with pastas, pizzas and entr√©es, but by no means is an Italian joint.

It probably will be good for the winter cold, but felt like it wasn't entry friendly.  Maybe there was some hallucinogens being smoked nearby.

It was a build your own veggie burrito experience, and I'm uncertain if anything is extra, but as it turns out, it's all inclusive in the price. Guacamole too. ! \\n\\nNext, I go outside to eat it while waiting for the 66 bus. There is a seating area outside where you can eat, but I discover it's not accessible from outside; you have to go back inside to get there. Not a biggie, but unclear til after I exited. And as the access to run for the bus wouldn't be easy if I go in and out to eat right there, I cross over to sit on the bench to eat while waiting for the bus. \\n\\nNow to see if the first bite will be a squirter, and do my clothes a nasty. I unwrap it and set the bag carefully to eat over my lap. No squirt, but Yummmm! Delicious. Rice (two kinds?), beanage, sour cream, salsa, guac, tomato, other things... I'm in warmish coolish veggie burrito heaven. Every bite was a pleasure. And not one spill on my clothes. Perfect outdoor bench food, lovely clouds, and the bus doesn't come 'til I'm finished.

Their salad is absolutely delicious, it's huge too! Their meat is definitely juicy and has a ton of flavor. My favorite part of this restaurant though is their red salsa, it's extremely spicy and has tons of flavor.

The risotto - so often effed up - was light and flecked with parmesan. The reduction married the veal to the risotto. It was a truly transcendent dish. \\n\\nMy house made pasta with mushrooms could never compare to the Veal- but in its own world it was exactly what you would want - woodsy, creamy, textured.

We ordered the Sea Scallops, Duck, Spring Salad, and Lamb Gnocchi (in order of favorites, best to least best). The sea scallops and duck were very good. The spring salad was a nice light option. The lamb gnocchi was bland and a miss. \\n\\nFor our entrees we had the Osso Buco, Swordfish, Cod, Seafood over spaghetti and Veal Porterhouse, again in order of favorites, best to least. Osso Buco was great - great flavor, tender. Swordfish and cod also very nice choices. Cod came with poached calamari which was cold while the rest of the dish was warm - how dish was intended but would have been better if the whole dish was the same temperature! The seafood over spaghetti was pretty good but I would skip it if you're wrestling between options. The veal porterhouse was \\"uninspired\\" and tough, to quote my co-diner. \\n\\nThe desserts -  cranberry cobbler, apple tart and rum baba. Cranberry cobbler was decent, apple tart was not, and rum baba tasted like a few pieces of warm bread dipped in rum sauce. The desserts were all disappointing and the rum baba should have been served in the bread basket before the meal, not after. \\n\\nOverall, food was good, a few surprising misses given the reputation of the restaurant, and everything was just warm (except the poached calamari!). Nothing came out hot. \\n\\nDrinks - You will notice we did not order any drinks. We are a table of non-drinkers. The waiter seemed pretty unhappy about this from the very beginning of the meal (way to make non-drinkers feel comfortable!), which completely changed the waiters tone and set the stage for our overall experience. See service below. \\n\\nThe (really) bad: Awful service. The food came out quick and the drinks (water!) were kept full all night. Cannot knock that. But our waiter and his assistant's attitudes were awful and both were completely unprofessional. (I think) it started when we did not order drinks (see above). After that our waiter was not just unfriendly, but was completely unhelpful and had an attitude that we should be waiting on him, not the other way around. He did not give is any feedback on the menu when asked (but was more than helpful with the tables next to us, asking questions, making suggestions, etc.). The person who ordered the seafood and spaghetti squash dish asked for Parmesan and the waiter said he does not recommend that, so we took his advice to the detriment of our enjoyment of the dish. Maybe ten mins later the same dish came out to the table behind and he OFFERED Parmesan! It was shocking. He did not once ask how our meal was or smile. He checked on our neighbors and asked how their meal was a few times! And he smiled! At a few times during the meal him and his assistant were at the staging area looking at us, turning away to talk about us (we overheard them!) and then looked back to smile. Our waiter smelled like he had taken a cigarette break between each course, which is extremely unpleasant when he's leaning over you to put your food down. When we got our check he added a few drinks to the bottom of our check, which is quite the coincidence. \\n\\nOverall: The food was good but not in line with its yelp or zagat ratings, priced a little high for what it was (if it was actually a 27 it would be priced fair), and needless to say our service was not good.

When my friend and I walked into the small dimly lit dining room, we noticed that the place was full of men.  We were the only women in there the entire time.  \\nI'm not saying that this means anything...\\n\\nOne thing that I found odd right off the bat was that there was only one server.  The  place was packed.  She was running around, frantically.  Once she got to us, we ordered a rice dish with bay shrimp, Udon noodles with Chicken and Peanut sauce, Shrimp on a stick, kimchi, and of course, Sake.  Everything came out in a timely manner, accept for one of the entrees.  When I informed our server that we hadn't recieved our second entree, she spasticallly looked through her ticket book, and asked, \\"well, do you want me to put another order in?\\"  I then asked how long she thought it would take, and she proceeded to say, \\"It's up to you if you want it or not,\\"   With a flustered attitude.  And no apology.\\n\\nI have to say that my experience at Tanuki was immediately tainted by the way that she spoke to us.  I looked at my friends and she decided for us that we wouldn't be waiting for our second entree.\\n\\nOverall, the food at Tanuki was good, but nothing that spectacular.        I really don't have too many complaints.  I would definitely recommend the food to my carnivorous friends, not so much vegetarian though. \\n\\nOne more thing, when our server returned with the check, she apologized for the mix up, and proceeded to inform us that the \\"Chef\\" only has one hot plate back in the \\"kitchen.\\"  I'm sorry folks, but what kind of an establishment seats 25 people and plans on cooking for them with one hot plate.

I called them to find out if they have sopes. The woman that answered the phone, told me they don't have sopes but they do have huaraches. My next question was ?if they make them fresh at the moment you order? She told me  yes indeed they make them fresh at the time your order them.\\nJust so I'm understood. I make a point to ask this question whenever I order sopes. Why? Because some Mexican food carts, and restaurants buy the sopes premade from a factory and I don't care for those ones at all. They tend to be very dry and tuff. Also, they almost always have to deep fry them just so they aren't dry and tuff. Which makes them crispy and full of oil and grease. I also asked her if they could heat or cook my huarache without deep frying; I heard her asking some body I assume was the cook, she relayed to me that yes they could heat up the hurache without deep frying..  Off we went to El Coyote.\\n\\nI got one Huarache vegan. My friend got chicken  enchiladas plate. I was going to get a jaimica to drink but they were all out. My friend got a Mexican coca cola. \\nOn top of the Huarache were mashed up pinto beans lettuce, chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, and guacamole. It was very good. My friend enjoyed his Enchiladas. Are only complaint was the beans had to much salt. \\nThe guacamole color was lite. Which prompted me to ask if they use dairy, or mayonase. I was assured that their was no dairy.  They offered 2 salsas red and green the red was ok. But I did get a roasted chilli. Which was a nice addition .50¬¢\\n\\nIt's $6 for the huarache. With no meat. It really should be about $4 or $5. Because it's not huge. However El Coyote is no different then all of the of places that offer sopes. This is a typical price. I know of one other place that charges $4.75 and their was one place now closed which charged $3 or $3.50. \\n\\nIts strictly street parking.

You can imagine my surprise when a coworker recommended we check the area out and I had never even heard of it.  But since I'm open to trying new things, and am not one to like being left out of the loop, I wanted to know this new craze a little better.

Their beer and alcoholic drink selection is excellent as well.\\n\\nI took a leap and tried their lunch buffet one day and found it to be exceptional.

Go for the wine bar\\n\\nHeard good things and went in for a last minute celebration date on a Monday evening. We had reservations just in case and arrived/got seated right away. It took the server a couple minutes to come over to take drink orders but we didn't think twice about it. He helped me pick a wine based on what I told him I liked, which was nice, but when I asked for a half glass, he just poured the rest of the sample glass and walked away, and was never given the half glass I asked for. \\n\\nMoving on to dinner, my date and I ordered 2 apps to start/share and, no joke, those took almost 30 minutes to come out. There was no apology or update while we were waiting or when they finally arrived, and our server was nowhere in sight for the entire time we were waiting. (I should note that it was not busy at all, there were only a few other tables seated and maybe 4 people at the wine bar). It took another couple minutes for the server to come over to retrieve our app settings and mise the table. Then we ordered our entrees.\\n\\nThose took just as long to arrive as the apps did, and again no apology, notice, or server to be found. When they arrived, my date and I nearly laughed. We expected little food on big plates, but not this bad. Very tiny portions for the price, and each dish was incredibly salty and was nothing that good. Vaguely reminiscent of things you could buy frozen at a store and microwave it at home and save $100. Not awful, but not very good. \\n\\nBy the time we were maybe halfway through our meals, my wine glass was empty and, yet again, our waiter was nowhere to be found. Couple minutes later and my water glass was empty. He never came by again to ask if I needed more of anything and never came by to ask how the meals were. Once we were done, he finally emerged from wherever he'd been and took our plates, asked how it was, and then said something like \\"well they would have been better with the meat left it\\". (One dish was ordered sans the meat) Ok thanks. Check please.\\n\\nHe brought it over after a normal amount of time, and when we opened it, it was for another one of the three tables in the dining room. Again, he disappeared so we had to flag down the host who came over and took it to be replaced. Our magician server returned to give us the correct one, and not a single word was spoken, let alone a simple apology. And that set us over the edge. We paid, and when he came back to take the bill, he finally re-filled my water (about an hour too late), and we got up and left, still hungry, and went to our favorite bar for better food.\\n\\nIt would take much convincing to get me to return to Bin 26."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I love it Glenn was our waiter he was great their was eight of us and we all are ladies he took our orders without a pen are paper yes he mesmerized everything and a couple of us changed our mind several times ....

The girl at the coffee bar said there was NO sharing allowed.  I had to get the pot that has 4 cups of tea to be able to share with another person.  Seriously?   We are living in America land of the free, not 80's commie Russia.  Why can't I share my tea?  I didn't want two cups of tea I wanted one cup.

We had our own semi-private table so we might have avoided some potential issues with seating and noise.

Normally I don't really pay much attention to the service unless it's really bad, but this time I really noticed how good it actually was.  \\n\\nAll the food I had ranged from very good to excellent.  We had the calamari and the gourgeres to start.  The calamari was fantastic - light, crispy, salty, citrusy.  Probably the best or second best I've had.  The gougeres were good, but not really my thing.  I got the steak frites for my main course.  This dish was amazing.  This is certainly the best steak frites I've ever had and I'm sure the best in the city.  The steak was well seared and cooked perfectly.  The sauce on it was delicious as well.  The fries were really great too.  Light and crisp.  Probably some of the better fries I've had around the city.  Seriously, I know it's just \\"meat and potatoes\\" but this dish was pretty much perfect.  I sampled some other main courses, such as the mezzalune and the chicken, which were great but not quite as amazing as my dish.  For dessert, I had the toffee cake which was excellent.   I also tried some of the profiteroles and a few of the other desserts which were all very good as well.   \\n\\nThe only criticism I could maybe bring up is that the location (basically a small office park) is a bit odd.  For example, the restroom is shared by a bunch of other businesses.  So the atmosphere is a little strange, but that's a pretty minor quibble.  \\n\\nEverything really was on point here.

Service was a bit slow to start, but we ended up having a really nice meal. The bread/pesto and olives they bring out were a great start.\\n\\nThe waiter was very nice, giving us an honest opinion that a lot of the appetizers are really small (i.e. lobster pasta is one ravioli, meatballs are really small and you only get 3, etc.) and to gauge what you order with how hungry you are. We ended up splitting the oysters (there were 5), the duck, and the carpaccio. The menu changes daily, but the combo of these 3 apps was a perfect amount of food. Each appetizer was delicious; the oysters were baked Florentine style, the duck was tender and fell off the bone, and the carpaccio had great texture.\\n\\nI got the beef tenderloin with foie gras, asparagus, and macaroni. It was a really tasty dish, with a couple of faults. Firstly, the piece of foie gras was extremely wimpy. Maybe the size of a quarter. I suppose I should have expected that, but it was still a bit disappointing. Second, the macaroni was luke-warm verging on cold. Again, a bit annoying when you're paying $34 for an entree. And last, I asked for medium-rare beef; it ended up medium-rare on the edges and rare in the middle. This was an OK mistake, as I'd prefer my meat under rather than over done. But again, I'd have preferred hot macaroni and steak the way I ordered it, instead of the opposite.\\n\\nAll in all it was a delicious meal. Everything we ate was good, and I had a great time.

The side door was locked, so I and another customer had to walk around to the front door. I didn't mind the 5 second walk but I do wonder why the side door was lock. For safety reasons? Maybe they lock the side doors once the sun goes down? Who knows. The lady that was my cashier was awesome! She was super friendly and great. She was making jokes and knew how to smile. She was great --honestly. I asked her about one of the drinks they sell (Mountain Dew Sangrita) and she immediately offered me a sample. Who knew you could sample at a fast food restaurant? The interior was clean too. I didn't notice any dirty messes or I cleaned tables. When it was my turn to order, I ordered my three Doritos tacos which came out in less than 5 minutes (expected because it's a fast food shop).

Pizza is my comfort food, and I can never resist a good wood fired pie. We were able to snag a spot at the bar very quickly, which was wonderful. We were in the mood for great food, but not for standing around for hours waiting for it. We split a mixed greens salad - simple and fresh, the fennel sausage pie - incredible, and a build your own with pepperoni and basil - spicy and delish! The meal was exactly what I wanted, and I'm sure I will return. \\n\\nKeep in mind this is one of those hybrids between a restaurant and a quick to go spot. There is plenty of seating, and it is decorated beautifully (I'm really into the light fixtures!), but you order at the counter and set your own table, refill your own water, etc. The only interaction we had with the staff was at the counter when ordering/paying. I'm not sure what the protocol is for tipping on this system, but it definitely isn't sit down restaurant service by any means. Not that that is bad thing, just something to keep in mind, especially when you're paying. \\n\\nI'm sure I\\"ll be back for a delicious pie without the fuss or 2 hour wait.

I ordered Roti, Beef Satay, Pad Thai, and Spring Rolls.\\n\\nThe roti was rather interesting.  I was expecting a crispy crepe-type of bread, but received what appeared to be scallion pancakes with a curry that wasn't spicy at all, even though the menu listed it as a spicy item.  The curry was delicious, but the scallion pancakes were just plain odd.\\n\\nThe beef satay was good.  It lived up to my expectations.\\n\\nThe pad thai was good as well.  It was good in the sense that it tasted good, but did not quite taste like the pad thai that I am used to.  It did not have the slight acidity of lime juice, and did not have much spice if any, in it.\\n\\nThe spring rolls were where this place shined.  The spring rolls were crispy and delicious despite the time it took for delivery.\\n\\nNow that I have mentioned the delivery time, I'll mention that it took longer than the 45 min estimated delivery time to arrive.  Now, I forgive them on this as delivery times are estimates, and that as long as the food arrives hot and delicious, and the crispy foods aren't soggy.  This is why this place receives 4 out of 5 stars for the food, and none were taken away for delivery time.\\n\\nThe delivery driver was a different story.  He had a bit of an attitude when he arrived, and scoffed at me when I tipped him.  Do yourself a favor and visit this place, sit down, enjoy your food, and tip the waiter; someone who deserves your money.  I probably will not get delivery from this place again although I will most likely eat in or get take-out."},{"name":"Thai Grille","address":"15 E College Ave","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"love this little gem hidden in downtown westerville.  everything ive tried has been fresh and flavorful.  the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) is worth the trip alone. gf friendly too."},{"name":"The Red Wagon","address":"2128 East Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The taste of that crisp pork belly haunts me.\\n\\nYou know, you'd think I'd be more annoyed at having to wait 45 minutes in line for a diner.

I emailed using their contact form about making reservations and requesting a dessert to be brought out after our dinner. I received an immediate response from the owner, Darren, asking me what time I'd like to come in and what kind of dessert he would like. I replied, then heard nothing back. But, I figured it would be okay. My mistake.\\n\\nWe arrived and I said I \\"might\\" have a reservation, told the hostess my name, and was greeted with a completely blank stare. Then, she looked at her book and said, \\"Um, no....\\". Fine, no big deal, I should have called to confirm. We waited at the bar and ordered drinks. Less than 5 minutes later, the hostess came over to the bar and started calling my name while looking around. She stared right at me, then continued to call my name. She had just seen me literally 5 minutes ago.\\n\\nShe brings us to a table where our butts brushed the faces of the patrons on the left and right of us while we got ourselves into the seats, a pleasure for them I'm sure. I understand making the most of the available space, but *no one* likes sitting so close to the people next to them that you can be a part of their conversation and touch their table with your elbows.\\n\\nOur server came over, we ordered two appetizers, the mac & cheese with chorizo and bacon wrapped dates. When the appetizers arrived, she said, \\"Let me take these menus out of your way.\\" to which I replied, \\"Well, could be put in an order first?\\" I then ordered a drink off the drink special sheet that was inside my menu. She tells me, \\"Oh sorry, that's for our Prohibition Night, they're not available now. They shouldn't have been in that menu.\\" Um, okay. To her credit, she did recommend a delicious drink that included the same ingredients. \\n\\nAfter she left, the table next to our left grabbed her and said, \\"We're ready to order please!\\" They were already seated and had drinks when we took our seats, so who knows how long they had to wait to order. Then the table to the right of us had to ask about their appetizers. They had apparently ordered them quite awhile ago and had yet to receive them. The service all around was flaky at best. Perfectly pleasant,  but as if the hostess and wait staff had never worked in a restaurant before.\\n\\nThe food itself was delicious. There is definitely someone in the kitchen who knows what they're doing. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious, I could have eaten a dozen of them. The small plate mac and cheese was equally tasty, but a little watery and the chorizo barely noticeable. For our main dishes we had the carrot and cauliflower gratin and beef barley stew. The stew was flavorful and the cornbread crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The gratin was also delicious, cheesy, crunchy, and the balsamic glazed brussel sprouts equally tasty.\\n\\nThe food I give 4-stars, the service 2 stars. I can't say with confidence that I think this place will be around in a year. Maybe if the staff and service improve?

My guy was in the mood for bbq so I suggested that we finally try them out. It is actually super close to my house - less than 10 minutes. So I was really hoping to like this place. Parking was a bit confusing cause there is a shared drive. I wasn't sure if we had to park right by the building or if we could park further away. Parking right by the building is super tight. I couldn't pull in from the main drive so the attendant had me pull back into the street and up a little drive that really isn't intended as such. I kinda had to drive a bit over the curb. But it gets better. Upon leaving, some asshole was parked in front of us, completely blocking cars. So I had to back out into said drive/curb again to get out.

Chicken was DRY. Yes, it is smoked, but I think you can still have smoked chicken without it being dried out. It smelled real good, but my guy could tell just from looking at it that it was dry. I did not like the cole slaw at all. Took one bite and said forget it. Beans were just OK. Mac and cheese was just OK. I like mine WAY better. \\n\\nService was OK.

But, Beau Jo's was different because I saw it featured on the Travel Channel's \\"Man vs. Food\\" show and I am notorious for jumping in where Adam Richman has already conquered (sort of) . Knowing full well that there was no way I was going to attempt the 14 pound mountain high pizza challenge, I decided to give their pizza a try just because it looked so damn good on television. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. \\n\\nNow I know the camera adds pounds... but Beau Jo's pizza will undoubtedly add more pounds to your waistline than any 700 cameras ever could. The dough is puffy and delicious, crisp on the outside but oohey gooey warm and soft on the inside. All of the toppings are fresh, plentiful and piled high. And just for added measure, they have honey for you to put on the crust that's left over at the end of your pizza slice. Because, you know... when you think \\"pizza\\", naturally your next thought would be \\"honey\\", right? Don't worry, I had the same reaction... but oh my... it seriously hits the spot! \\n\\nThey also have a salad bar for those of you who go to a pizza place and don't want pizza. It's adequate and stocked with the usual fixings, but nothing that would amaze your friends or fool your enemies. A simple kid's menu is also available, but let's be honest... if your kid decides they want something OTHER than pizza, check for a fever. \\n\\nBeau Jo's never leaves me hankerin' for more. In fact, I've been known to tell my husband to pull the car around so I won't be forced to walk one more step than is absolutely necessary. I don't like to waddle in public if I can help it. \\n\\nThere are a few drawbacks to Beau Jo's, but it is NOT the food. Parking can be frustrating... no... infuriating is more like it. More often that not, the place is extremely busy, especially during the months when school is in session. I think I once saw the entire UC football team in there for dinner one night. It is also a local favorite for every parent with an unruly child it seems. There's nothing I hate more than trying to eat with a cute (but exceedingly annoying) child either running in circles around your table or staring at you while you chew.

We could not even hold the menus to look at what we wanted to eat. We were holding them by the side of the menu with our finger tips. Very disgusting.  So we ordered the avocado chicken salad for 10.00 the drunken chicken for 10.00 and come to find out the chicken was only the sandwich. So we ordered truffle fries for another 7.00.  We were the only ones in the restaurant the whole time we were there.  The food finally came out and the 10.00 salad came in a bowl the size of a small soup bowl. It was more like a small side salad. I was wondering if they ran out of salad. The chicken sandwich was ok. Nothing to write home about. And the truffle fries were the worst fries I have ever had. It seemed like they were soaking not fried but soaking in grease.  So with our groupon we ended up paying way too much for the food.

A nice flavorful but mild cheese sandwiched between Texas-sized pieces of crunchy toast that dripped butter down your chin.

Boring!) \\n\\nWalking into Petunia's was so amazing. It's open, airy, beautiful, clean, and with an amazing display case of gorgeous treats. I was overwhelmed with the menu - by default skipping over the tasty looking panini sandwich, mozzarella pizza, Mac & cheese, biscuit and gravy.... but alas, why? EVERYTHING is GLUTEN FREE people!!! And vegan (that's the part that blows my mind.) I don't mean to yell at you - I'm just really excited. When I hear food is \\"vegan\\" I probably feel like people feel when I tell them I've made something \\"gluten free\\" - oh here we go... but Petunia's... they hit the frosting on the cupcake. \\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered the mozzarella pizza with vegan sausage and kale. My teammate ordered the pesto sandwich (totally ordering that next time!) and everything was absolutely amazing. The crust of the pizza was just like a wood fired pizza - with the flour a little loose on the bottom, very Neapolitan style. Something that would usually require me to grill the cook (no pun intended) on if other flour products have touched the same surface and if they used a tray with my pizza - which is never fun for anyone and is way more stressful than enjoy full. But not at Petunia's! I was happy to eat every single last bite worry free of cross contamination. \\n\\nI was stuffed but you better believe that didn't stop me from ordering some tasty treats to go. I got a slice of the black and white cake and a berry bar (I'm 3 months pregnant and live in WA - don't judge me!) The slice of cake is the size of my head - and generally when you see cake that big, you can guarantee it's going to be dry. I can assure you that Petunia's treats are moist and fluffy! From the frosting to the light and moist layers of chocolate cake, it was pretty dang perfect. (How they make this taste THIS good and it be gluten free AND VEGAN absolutely baffles me). Up next was the berry bar - it was also crazy moist, and had perfect crumbles. I finished it all that night because I wanted to give an honest review and didn't feel leaving it in a to-go bag overnight was fair - I was just doing my part to give this pasty the justice it deserved.  My husband was also very shocked at how beautiful and \\"normal\\" everything looked. He kept asking me \\"how do they get the crumbles?\\" as if I'm in on their magic trick.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOk - so I finished my black and white cake on day 2 - that thing is WAY too massive to eat in 1 sitting, and OMG it's still so good! I refrigerated it overnight and it was still great this morning. You guys - this cake was better than my wedding cake, and I didn't have one of those nasty wedding cakes, it was decently good - this is SOOO much better!\\n\\nI have decided that YELP needs to give us 1 gold star to give out per year because I think Petunia's deserves so much more than just 5 stars!"},{"name":"TR Fire Grill","address":"7015 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Came here for a quick dinner after getting a hotel room nearby.

There is plenty of parking. It is light, clean, and bright and was not super busy for a Saturday morning. The young ladies working were very friendly and nice. There is indoor and outdoor seating. It is air conditioned!( This is good to know on a 100 degree day). \\n\\nThere are cubes filled with pastries to the right.  The process is that you grab a paper lined tray and a pair of tongs and cruise the cubes taking out what you want. They are labelled with the pastry's name and price. You take your tray full of goodies and your tongs to the register. It would be helpful if there were instructions posted. Other newbies were confused and either put dirty tongs back with clean ones ( just no)  or were baffled and did random things with them. They also stood around jamming up the process. \\n\\nSigh. \\n\\nPre coffee that can be annoying. \\n\\nMy child calls me salty. \\n\\nReally. Just put up some instructions. \\n\\nThe register ladies put the pastries on pretty white plates. I had to request silverware ( so we could cut everything in two for sharing). They brought our drinks to the table. \\n\\nIn addition to pastries and espresso drinks there are a selection of sandwiches on that fluffy white bread with the crusts cut off and a few cold beverages in the case at the counter. We had to request ice water at the register. It'd be great if that was available to serve ourselves. It was cold and lemony with ice cubes. Nice. \\n\\nMy friend and I ordered iced mochas, which were delicious. We choose several pastries to share: a strawberry one, a raspberry, an apple crumbly one, a little chocolate filled  one, a cocoa  muffin like thing, and  I took a cute cone  shaped one with eyeballs home to my daughter. \\n\\nOur favorites were the berry ones and the apple crumbly thingy. They had really nice textures and were lightly sweet. Yum. \\n\\nI enjoyed my visit to this bakery and would go again. With a few tweaks it would be a five. \\n\\nFor people saying it is expensive, I don't agree. It's less than a  Starbuck's trip and the quality is better.

Having lived in France and not to mention was taking a french girl on a date here, I can say that it was executed very poorly. Everything in our meals, from the 'grilled' vegetables to the duck and pork that we ordered as main plates was overcooked and burnt. Anyone looking for great cuisine should head elsewhere, especially if you're searching for good French. To add insult, the food wasn't composed of great ingredients that might justify the price tag, so it hurt to eat burnt food then pay approx $30/plate.\\nService was also terrible. You know how the waiter brings you over over a bottle of wine, uncorks it, then pours a little into your glass? So you can taste the wine you're buying and make sure it's ok? Yeah, when it's not OK, usually they bring you another along with an apology for not keeping the wine correctly. This was the first and only time in my entire life I've been faced with a corked bottle of wine (at a restaurant), and it tasted awful. After informing the waiter that the wine was corked and not good anymore, he said it needed to \\"breathe\\". Vinegar doesn't turn to wine when it breathes, so we humored him. After 15 minutes we told him again, and he said it was just a strong tasting wine. My date asked me to drop it, she hates confrontation, so I humored her and told him that we'd like another bottle- which he never brought.\\n\\nWhy two stars? Wicked romantic in there, it's got great ambiance. So, if you're interested in appetizers and a good long stare, go for it....if you're interested in good food and service, go somewhere else. Me?

(Acutally it probably does come with onion but I always ask for food without onions.) \\n\\nI've heard that the steak tips are supposed to be one of their standout dishes, but in my opinion Salem Wood Cafe in Malden serves bigger and more tender and juicy steak tips, and New Bridge Cafe in Chelsea definitely has a more flavorful marinade on their tips.\\n\\nNow the good news ... veal bona boca is outstanding. Three large medallions of veal, pounded thin, sauteed with mushrooms and topped with prosciutto and cheese in a marsala wine sauce, over linguini. The veal was tender and the portion was larger than expected.

That should serve as your 1st indicator of how AWESOME this place is. \\n\\nLiving in the Bay Area (San Jose, CA) for 13 years gave me the opportunity to experience some of the best Mexican Restaurants and Taquerias in the country.\\nAs a result, I'm passionate about my damn tacos! \\n\\nSince relocating back to GA in 2007, I have been unable to fill the void in my life when it comes to quality, authentic Mexican food.

I go, damn near religiously, every Saturday while out and about or running errands.\\n\\nYou really can't go wrong when picking any of the fresh meats for your tacos. But the star of the show for me is undoubtedly the beef barbacoa. Man, there is truly something special about that barbacoa. It's a gift from God. \\n\\nThe aforementioned, fresh toppings/salsa bar is always on point. I normally opt for the onions, cilantro and chile de arbol. If you like, you can add aguacate (avocado) or queso at the time of your order for an add'l charge (forgot how much, but cmon...the tacos are $1). \\n\\nThe only thing here that needs work is the refried beans (if you plan on getting the taco plate w/ rice and beans). I normally just get my tacos a la carte so it's not a big deal. Just a heads up. They're pretty bad. \\n\\nBeyond the food, the employees are very nice and accommodating.

WRONG we had just enough time to do  a shot of bourbon on the crowded north end street full of goombas and hipsters then 10 minutes later were being led to our table. The ambiance was good and our waitress was very helpful. She recommended the buffalo fried calamari that wasn't on the menu. that shit was great. Crispy and spicy, All the appetizers were pretty good, and my eggplant parm was tasty with a decent red sauce and im a picky sumbitch when it comes to my sauce. The girlfriend got the chicken broc with alfredo and it was pretty tasteless unfortunately but that's a boring dish anyways and  pretty much the adult version of getting mac and cheese when your out to eat. At least she didn't  ask them to cut up a hot dog into it for her. throw on a couple of drink between me and her and we got out for less than a hundo. If you dont leave this place with two meals worth of leftovers then you should consider cutting down on your carb intake."},{"name":"Peoples Rx","address":"3801 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"People's pharmacy is the best pharmacy I have ever been in!!

I came here for brunch after an event at the convention center and had brunch there.  The menu looked good--I had a lot of trouble deciding but everything was only okay.  The servers were very nice but the service was slow---not sure if it was because there were a lot of people heading there but they were just really slow especially for eggs.  It had a nice vibe and I got nervous after checking reviews and wanted to give this place a chance but feel that most of the reviewers had it right.  \\nOne note though, the chips and guac were good--many reviewers noted the chips were stale.  We were also the first people in the restaurant."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is pure heaven!!! $5 pies?!?! $4 delicious beers?!?!

The food is decently priced, not expensive by any means. Really liked eating on the back patio, they had big tvs to watch the game. I liked that you could order half and half with the sides as well, we did half fries half tater tots. Typical beer selections, we ordered a couple pitchers. Overall a good spot."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"First, the good, service was excellent. That is the end of the good.\\n\\nFood was subpar. Asked for the house specialty since I wanted to give them their best shot. Tried chicken parmesan and fettuccini alfredo. Quality was somewhere around Sbarro's. Alfredo sauce was basically cream and oil with no cheese.

Basically. And let me tell you, this place was kicking. I had the tofu coconut milk curry, and, and, I just dont know what to tell you, it was freaking SICK man. it was good. All the usual suspects in the clay pot: sweet peas, regular and sweet potatoes, zuchini, lightly friend tofu, spices, pepper green beans YUM YUMS. We had some Pad Thai too which was awesome (sweeter than Im used to but good). We had tofu satay, and the peanut dipping sauce was great. \\nFriendly service, good food, regular prices, the only downside was our food took a while and the place wasnt very busy (thursday at lunch time) so if you dont have a lot of time, be wary!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It's funny, I was searching for the \\"coolest vibe\\" restaurant in Austin, and Salty Sow came up.

I added an egg to the burger and it was out of this world ! The handmade cinnamon buns were excellent. Why 4 stars ? The gal taking our order was quite rude. Not only was she so nonchalant and clearly didn't care. Closed out order out before we were finished ordering and had to open a new ticket to take the rest of the order. Secondly, while washing our hands my daughter was grabbing a paper towel and the very same gal swung the door wide open knocking my daughter to the ground. Not even an apology but she offered her some milk... like that's going to do something."},{"name":"Hops N Scotch","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Cool at atmosphere and great food!
