We met the owner right away and she was a hard working sweet heart. The menu was pretty full of your basic Thai except no meat!

Next, we went for the coconut soup and my girl was hollering like Meg Ryan in Sleepless in Seattle. It was the best coconut soup I've ever had for sure.

So I vowed that this summer, I would make it over there. Somehow.\\n\\nI live alll the way in the westside, so my mom and I made the trek because I believed in the quality and goodness of this place. And I was not let down for sure. \\n\\nDonut review: crispy on the outside with a slight crunch while the inside is a light, fluffy texture that is absolutely divine. Not yeasty or doughy at all--Pip's nails it on the consistency. In terms of flavors, there isn't a diverse spread but the ones offered are indulgent. Raw honey + sea salt, lots of Nutella involved in some options, an apricot jam (seasonal I think), cinnamon sugar--we ordered six just to get a snippet of all the flavors. I also think it would be cool if Pip's incorporates dark chocolate as a ganache rather than Nutella. Nutella may be a crowd pleaser, but it's not the same level of fresh and natural sweetness as raw honey, for example. \\n\\nI also ordered the EmmyLou, which was decaf herbal chai with lavender, chamomile, and fennel. This, to me, was not exactly a \\"chai,\\" but it used a variety of different natural fresh herbs to create a drink that's pleasing to the palette. More elegant than spicy. \\n\\nAll in all--totally worth it. If I lived around the neighborhood I'd pop in here probably every week!

Instead they had a great selection of sours, stouts, and blonde ale's. The food was to die for as well. I had a barbecue pork steamed bun and a roasted duck bun. They were both incredible and only four dollars a piece. The bartenders were great, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable on the beers as well as the food.

Absolutely loved the elaborate, whimsical, steampunk decor and fun, vibrant atmosphere; the service provided by our awesome waiter, Leo, as well as the delicious food, both savory and sweet. There was colorful candy galore and beautifully crafted, delectable looking chocolates, cookies, caramel apples, cupcakes and more on display. The restaurant itself is quite expansive, consisting of 2 floors, gold and bright lights. We were seated downstairs in a cozy booth.\\n\\nUpon being seated, we were given the fancy menu, which is really a book of delightful sounding appetizers, entrees, milkshakes and desserts. On the first page, there is a cute story about the owner, Penelope and how the restaurant came to be. We even had a chance to meet Penelope and she was lovely. Very friendly and kind. \\n\\nOur waiter, Leo provided excellent service throughout the evening. Really one of the best waiters I have ever had. He was personable, attentive and funny. He was also very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 appetizers: Warm chocolate almond bread and truffle fries. The bread was a great deal -  a whole loaf for only $2.95. However, I did not taste a strong flavor of chocolate or almond, though it was served warm with lovely tasting salted caramel butter. I think adding chocolate chips to the bread would bring out a melted chocolate taste. \\n\\nThe truffle fries came with shredded Parmesan, fresh herbs and white truffle oil. This was so incredible - The taste of the truffle oil really stood out and the fries were perfectly crispy. \\n\\nFor my entr√©e, I was having a hard time choosing between the gnocchi with mole sauce and the shrimp and crab mac & cheese. I finally decided on the gnocchi, but sampled some of the mac & cheese from my friend. I preferred the mac & cheese but the gnocchi was still decent, which included grilled chicken, sweet peppers and rapini. The mole sauce was made up of 3 parts: chocolate, spices and cream. I was able to detect the spices and cream, but not so much the chocolate, however the sauce was still great. It had a slight tang to it and was incredibly smooth. I also liked that the dish was chock full of chicken and the sweet peppers and other vegetable was very fresh and mixed in well. The gnocchi itself was also cooked perfectly al dente and had a great fluffy, buttery consistency. All the ingredients mingled together nicely. \\n\\nThe Shrimp and Lump Crab Mac & Cheese was made with fresh garganelli pasta, fontina and mornay sauce, which is basically b√©chamel sauce with shredded or grated Gruy√®re cheese added. There were 4 shrimps placed on top of the dish and the crab was incorporated into the pasta. Even though it was imitation crab, it tasted so wonderful. I also loved how cheesy the pasta was - Very rich and satisfying meal. \\n\\nThen of course we had to order dessert. I was torn between one of their huge and beautiful looking milkshakes or one of the more traditional desserts, so I asked Leo for his opinion. He suggested the milkshake because after consuming it, you get to keep the cup that it was in, which is a really cool souvenir. \\n\\nI finally decided on the Marshmallow Crisp Milkshake, but didn't want a boring vanilla milkshake, so Leo allowed me to customize it. I chose the Nutella Milkshake and it came decked out with rice crispies, marshmallow fluff, fresh whipped cream, huge marshmallow and rice krispies treat. It was crafted so carefully and looked so pretty. The milkshake was pretty good, but didn't really wow me. I feel like it tasted more like regular chocolate, instead of Nutella, so that was a bit disappointing. The marshmallow and rice krispies treat were yummy though. I think if I had to do it over, I would choose a more unique milkshake. \\n\\nWe also tried the May Contain Nuts Sundae, which consisted of peanut butter ice cream, peanut brittle, Reese's peanut butter cups, chocolate peanut butter pie, peanut butter sauce, Reese's Pieces and whipped cream. This came on a tray so it was a bit messy, but I really enjoyed the peanut butter ice cream and the chocolate peanut butter pie. Very sweet and delightful mix of peanut butter and chocolate!\\n\\nWe truly enjoyed our time here and I would definitely come back.

First off I got free drink coupons from America's Great Escape Game which was the incentive to go here in the first place. Once we arrived, they wanted to charge $5 to park in the parking lot! So we parked at Don Pablo's and walked over. We didn't have a door fee like other reviews mention and we were seated right away. It was fairly early in the night and there weren't many people in the place.\\n\\nOur server shows up and points out what drinks we can get complimentary with my coupons (beer and a few mixed drinks). The three of us settle with 2 hurricanes and a margarita. When they arrive, they are literally in 6 oz mugs. They were gone in two sips and were horrible! My margarita was basically all sour mix and nothing else. We flag the server down and decide to try another round of something else. We should have left but we figured the horrible drinks were an indicator of the free coupons and not the place itself. We asked what all the beers were on tap because we couldn't see what two of the drafts were and we were told it was the margarita mix. Yup...it comes premixed from a beer tap. No wonder it was horrible. The boys each order a beer in one of their signature bone glasses and I ordered another mixed drink this time with grapefruit juice because I can't learn a lesson. \\n\\nOur drinks arrive and luckily you can't screw up beer so the boys were happy. I get mine and it's not horrible but it doesn't wow me either.

In the meantime, the stage is being rolled out, the dj has started to play and the place is getting busier. This is probably the time to tell you our server is moody and not attentive. Maybe it would have been different if we had gotten food. Our drinks are done and we have decided to get out of there except our server is currently dancing on stage. Yup, the dj invited all the servers to come dance to a song which means the entire place stops running. No one is getting seated. No one is getting drinks, food or checks. We are forced to wait till this 5 minute song is over to resume operations and none of the servers seem happy to be dancing and no one dining there is happy to be ignored. I watched one couple just leave and not pay their bill. I'm sure it happens a lot, the guys I was with wanted to do the same. I ended up sitting alone waiting for the check while the guys went outside because they had had enough. The check legit came to $56 for 3 drinks! So over priced, bad service and a total tourist trap.

Expecting to check-in, at midnight and after a long flight, with our fellow conference attendees we were told they had given our room away to someone else, but that Claire(front desk associate) had booked us a room at a Wyndham 3 miles away and would pay for it. She gave us a letter along with the front desk manager's business card(Ryan). She told us he would call us the next day, when we were promised to have a room, and make this up to us. Claire gave us taxi vouchers and sent us outside. Ten minutes later they ran outside to tell us that hotel didn't have any rooms and they would find us another hotel. We waited almost a half hour for this and were told they were sending us to another Wyndham 20 miles away, but that they would pay for it and the taxi. \\n\\nThe taxi finally arrived at 1am and drove us to the Wyndham. Once we arrived we learned they hadn't actually booked the room nor had they paid for it as Claire had told us. We ended up having to pay for the room because the management at Hyatt doesn't empower their associates to take care of situations like this(i.e. no access to a corporate credit card). We were told the next morning that the manager of the Hyatt had called the hotel and taken care of the charge. We then had to wait 40 minutes for the taxi company Hyatt had given us vouchers for to pick us up and had to wait over 1 hour in traffic to make it back to the city for our conference. Upon checking in at the Hyatt Regency Austin for the second night no one, including Ryan the manager we were promised would check on us, asked us how our stay at the Wyndham had been nor apologized for the gross negligence of the Hyatt team. All we found in our room was a note signed by Dan Johnson the manager personally apologizing for the inconvenience. I found this personal apology almost comical as it clearly wasn't written by him, but one of his employees(Claire?).\\n\\nThe disappointing element of this entire situation is that this review could have been avoided (I tend not to write them because I often sympathize with workers in the service industry.) had someone from management approached us, shown empathy, and asked how they could have made it better. They didn't so I've voiced my issues here.  I hope they learn from this situation, reevaluate their customer service goals, and reassess their management team.  This could have been an opportunity for them to demonstrate exceptional customer service skills, yet they approached it as nothing more than an obstacle to overcome.

I used to get donuts similar to these at an arena back home and they would make them right there in front of you. They served them with a little frosting cup and it was AWESOME.

And that's a very good thing. The drinks are perfect, the food is clever, the ambiance is happening. It's upscale industrial! Concrete and open ceilings! \\n\\nIt's not fancy as in white table cloths (there are none at all) or slick service. The kitchen (in the back) is open and fun to watch. The crowd is lively and so is the music. It feels more like a warehouse pop-up with cool food and drinks. In fact, I always sorta expect a food truck to come driving through the front windows (which is, btw, a nice place to sit on perfect Cambridge days -- about twice a year). Sometimes they DO team up with other chefs. There was the David Chang pop with Fuku chicken, which was totally fun and tasty. \\n\\nI've been there with reservations and without. And because I prefer sitting at the bar -- they give great cocktail! -- I don't mind walking in and putting my name on the list, which actually means giving my name to one of the bartenders. And in this regard -- that they take names for the bar -- they are totally civilized. I loathe that whole \\"bar is open seating, first come yyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeoooooowwww\\" because then instead of standing and enjoying the drink and the company, you have to keep an eye peeled in case some bro* comes in and assumes that the seats you've been patiently waiting for are up for grabs, leaving you no choice but to muscle your way past him, saying, ah, dude, wait-yer-turn, bro, or waiting another eon and a half for two more seats to clear. I hate that. All restaurants with scarce or desirable bar seating should take names. \\n\\nOn the most recent visit, we got the BLT wraps, which were great! We also got the foie gras but asked for a gluten-free version. They served it deconstructed with one small plate for the foie, and one giant plate for the crostini. (Still very good!) The bartender helped us navigate the menu to avoid the offending gluten. It turns out that the rice noodles aren't a good choice, which is, I guess, why it's good to make the server aware of allergies. We got the biryani instead, which was a disappointment. The spice overpowered the fish, and clashed with the rest of our meal. Oh well. Drinks were great. Date began with an oyster shooter with tequila and tomato, which he liked. Next time I might try one.\\n\\nMy biggest and most consistent complaint with Little Donkey is the host/check-in desk/whatever system. Because I wasn't sure we'd be able to get seats at the bar at 630 on a busy Friday night, I tried to get reservations earlier in the week. The on-line system would only give me 930 p.m. slot and so we decided to take our chances with the bar. But when I got there (early and alone), I thought it wouldn't hurt to put my name in for a table. So I went to the host stand to see if they'd have seats and was approached by a young guy. I told him what we wanted -- a two top for dinner-- and he said stuff about a 30 min wait and so I said okay, sure, but i'm going to also check at the bar. He says sure. But when I came back two minutes later, it was then that he tells me that he's not actually the person checking people in and that I had to put my name on another list, one that has already been populated by several couples who came in behind me. And then he starts seating people -- so much for the 30 minute wait. Meanwhile, the bartender calls me over for a seat almost immediately. He gave me a single and, when my date showed up a few minutes later, it wasn't long before he found us two together. He thoughtfully rearranged seating so as to maximize happiness for everybody involved. Yay!\\n\\nSo, on the best days at Little Donkey, you feel like a member of the club. On the worst, you feel like Spanky and the gang are reprising the He-Man Women Haters Club. \\n\\n(*Bros don't frequent this place. I'm still in favor of the list.)"},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Went for dessert.

Still so mad about my experience here last year. Not only was the food garbage (something I was willing to overlook bc it wasn't very expensive), our server stole the $20 in cash we put towards our bill. When we received our receipt our card was charged in the full amount. The server said there was no cash in the bill fold. There was. We had also mentioned it to her. She stole it. We asked to speak with the manager about this. We did not accuse the server of theft, rather said maybe it fell out or she didn't notice it. She said she knew we \\"thought\\" we put money in there but \\"clearly\\" we didn't. I told her i didn't appreciate her calling me a liar. She made a big show of saying how she didn't say we were liars (that's exactly what she was doing) then pretending to look around the floors of the restaurant (where the server never was) while schmoozing other guests. It took a full 45 minutes of this BS until She said she'd a take a few rounds of drinks off our order. There was only one round. We each had one weak cocktail, Which totaled about $14 ($14 is not the same as $20). So to sum in up, the food and drinks aren't worth it, your server might steal your cash, and the manager will say you are lying about your payment which was stolen by her staff.

We always start with the queso dip (as a previous review said make sure you ask for jalapenos!)  If you feel like something on the lighter side I would try either the chicken tortilla soup or the chicken fajitas, both great choices.  If you are really hungry try the chimichanga with shredded chicken.  They top it with their awesome queso which makes it delicious!  Obviously it's not the healthiest choice, but if you are dining at a Mexican restaurant, healthy eating might not be your concern for the meal.\\n\\nI would recommend Garcia's if you are looking for a neighborhood Mexican restaurant with traditional choices (ex. burritos, enchiladas, fajitas, chimichagas, tacos) and reasonable prices.

It has become our favorite restaurant in the greater Boulder area. Every time we go, the food, the service, and the experience are excellent. First, a few examples of the food, as follows:\\n\\nBread w/ Pesto Oil: Among the best bread we've ever had in a restaurant. So good, it could be a meal of its very own. A few slices with a glass of red wine? Perfection. And the accompanying pesto oil is fantastic.\\n \\nVongole: The sweetest little clams, in a white wine and garlic broth. Can't get enough of them.\\n\\nScampi: Excellent. Big, meaty, flavorful shrimp. So many places add too much garlic, such that the garlic overwhelms, but the Parma version allows the shrimp to shine, with only a hint of fresh garlic nicely accenting. And the olive oil-garlic sauce itself is so good that we always consume nearly every last drop (finishing it with the wonderful bread).\\n\\nPolpette: Best meatballs in Colorado. Perfect texture, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. And the accompanying sugo is delicious.\\n\\nPolenta w/ Gorgonzola Cream Sauce: Very good. The cream sauce has a wonderfully subtle flavor. My only quibble is that the polenta (which is good) is a bit lost under the ridiculously good richness of the sauce. (Suggestion? Twice the polenta, half the sauce.) But we will order this again, gladly.\\n\\nCalamari: Excellent. Only very slightly breaded, cooked perfectly so that it is perfectly tender, and served piping hot. Best fried calamari we've had in quite a while.\\n\\nPanzarotti: The best fried ravioli we've ever had. Stuffed with excellent mozzarella. But, oddly, we probably wouldn't order it again, only because it seems a bit unrefined and jarring compared to the simple elegance of the other food. (Unrefined by its nature, through no fault of Parma's.)\\n\\nAs for other aspects of the place. The wine list is nice, with a surprisingly wide range of offerings for only $7 and $8 per glass. One in particular, a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, seems perfectly suited to much of Parma's menu. (I'm using the word perfect a lot, aren't I?) Service is always good, and sometimes excellent. No disgruntled millenials, not that we've come across (unlike most places in the general area). The atmosphere is pleasant, the place smells decadently good.

The ox tails are usually tender with a great flavor, the dressing is def homemade and not box, the mac and cheese is fresh, and the greens were also tender with a good flavor.

They cook their food quick, I would not say they put a ton of love into it though. It's simple but tastes good. However their Sunday brunch is extremely disappointing. There are probably times the food is all fresh and hot but that is really inconsistent. The food sits there wide open even when the place is empty. It's either cold or dried out. The slicing station meat is over cooked and dry. The toasters are not good enough to have st my house, they are a joke. And who wastes plastic containers with individual butter pads? That's really odd. The brunch Buffett looks like someone who had no idea what they are doing out it together. I think if they got some good advice or visited some other Sunday brunches that are highly rated and learned from it, their brunch could be improved. But for now I am going to take some time off from coming here. Also, often I show up and there are multiple empty tables, multiple people waiting to be seated. I don't get it?

There are two great restaurants in the Magic Kingdom but they are always booked at dinner time. Hmm I wonder why? People love good food. I was rocking the new Disney App which was not allowing me too book any of my reservations. So I had to go old school and call Disney reservations. Nothing works better then dialing a phone number and speaking to a human. \\n\\nWe were able to secure reservations but we learned the fancy place we had just booked on the phone needed fancy attire. Our operator was able to luckily switch the reservations for us. Disney charges $10 per person for no shows or late arrivals. At first our operator freaked out but she came through and moved them with no extra charge. Crisis adverted because we were actually talking to a human. We all know the computer would have messed it up. \\n\\nOn a side note you will not have to swim here. There are two ways to arrive. You can take the resort monorail which is the first stop or take the boat to the hotel which is the first stop also. So get out of the lake and arrive via water or land craft, we're not alligators, which you might see up close if you chose to swim. \\n\\nThe Grand Floridian is a beautiful hotel and employees some of the best chefs in the world because we saw it on the Travel Channel. Disney has to with room prices starting at $800 a night here. Rich people like good food. Ha! No popcorn or Mickey ear pretzels for them.\\n\\nSo we were able to come into the cafe with our Magic Kingdom attire for a dinner break. We arrived 30 minutes early and we were able to grab our table sooner then expected which was great because we needed to get back to the Disney Magic across the lagoon. \\n\\nOur waiter Paul was really nice. I would have expected a little more polish on a waiter at this type of restaurant but I'm sure this is just a stepping stone for him in the culinary world of Disney. Everyone has to learn somewhere. \\n\\nThere is a kids menu here. Our princess went with milk, soup, pizza and something called dirt and worms. Don't worry they weren't real instead it was some gummy worms over pudding and crushed Oreos. She loved everything and after walking for 11 hours she needed a good meal. \\n\\nMy wife and I decided to order a bunch of things. We started out with the French Onion Soup and the seasonal salad. Both were really good. We took turns passing them back and forth to each other. I would highly recommend them. We then moved on to the crab cake which was good but not the best I've ever had. The star of the show was the pasta with chicken, prosciutto, peas & an asiago cheese sauce. Probably one of the better pastas I've had in a long time. Ordering Italian is hard for me because I cook it at home and it never seems good in a restaurant. My compliments because now I want to learn how to make an asiago cheese sauce. Yeah it was that good. \\n\\nWe also had some wine. Perfection in a glass. The Magic Kingdom is no Epcot and it is hard to find a drink in the park. In fact, I've never had a drink in the gates of the Magic Kingdom. I hear drinks are available at Tony's and Be Our Guest but we've never gotten into those locations. The boat trip and glasses of adult grape juice is worth the trip over. Hey we all need to eat and drink!\\n\\nThe hostess also set me up with a power plug. Yeah my phone was going down for the count and we were staying until 3am. I needed juice for another 10 hours. So it was worth it to grab some food for my family and my iPhone. \\n\\nI learned do not ask for items from other servers because they will not bring it to you. Instead they go and find your server and he brings it to your table. So there is not a team effort among the waitstaff. I did not like that but I have no idea if this is a company policy or the staff not liking each other. Hey I'm at a magical place and I'm not getting involved. Just figure it out. \\n\\nOnce dinner was done we strolled down to the boat dock for our return trip back to the Magic Kingdom via the Polonesian Village. There is never enough hours in the day to experience everything Disney has to offer but you can sure try. I would really recommend leaving the park and visiting one of the many restaurants at the various hotels. There's always a boat, monorail or bus that can get you there!

We sat ourselves in the covered patio section which is screened yet open to the outside and air-conditioned at the same time. This wet, dreary day the AC was working too well and it was chilly on the patio. The layout is a little awkward because if you're on the patio and need to use the restroom you have to go outside before going back inside to the main dining room. \\n\\nThey serve breakfast all day so that's what we had. I got the platter with egg, bacon, sausage and a biscuit with gravy. I figured this would give me a little sample of everything. My son got a bacon egg and cheese biscuit sandwich and really enjoyed it. Mine was just ok- I probably wouldn't get it again. The bacon was good- cooked crisp with a nice flavor. The sausage link was tiny and looked just like one from a Styrofoam package you'd get at the grocery store. The sausage gravy wasn't anything spectacular and I couldn't even really taste the homemade biscuit hiding underneath. We also ordered a bacon waffle which comes with a drizzle of cream cheese icing over top. The waffle sounded better than it was. It wasn't bad (how can a bacon waffle be bad?!?) but it could've been better. The icing hardened instead of staying gooey and made for hard little bites in the grooves of the waffle. Our particular waffle came out late (due to confusion during ordering) and had fallen apart as they took it out of the griddle. But they ended up not charging us for the waffle.\\n\\nService was fantastic. Our server had an easy friendliness to her that endeared her to all the tables she worked. It seemed like this place gets a lot of repeat, local business because our server knew which regular liked what. While we waited for our waffle she kindly brought us a small bowl of fresh fruit.

The atmosphere is sexy and date-y and in the fantasy world where I have sexy dates, I'd take them here.\\n\\nThe bad: Every other member of the staff seems to be offended that you walked in.  I imagine it has something to do with the fact that this place is constantly packed in the most annoying Cambridge tapas place way (see: Dali, Alden and Harlow, Cuchi Cuchi).  There are also several dishes that make no goddamn sense.  The burger is thumb-size and served on a cold potato roll.  And it costs something like $16.

You'd think with the long line and the surly service that this was the only pastry shop in the neighborhood.  Luckily it's not!\\n\\nMy first visit was a year ago and I got a lobster tail.  I also stopped in in the morning and there was really no line to speak of, so that was nice.  Unfortunately, a lobster tail is not the best snack to take on a mini-roadtrip.  I got a few bites of the ginormous pastry in before it had a meltdown and I realized that all the cream probably wasn't the safest to consume after it had been sitting in a hot car for a few hours.\\n\\nOn my recent trip, this was stop three in a series of three north end pastry shop visits to see which cannoli we liked the best.

But I wouldn't say it's any better or worse than the one at Modern (just more choices).  Our conclusion was that you're basically paying for the spectacle of having the box wrapped up with string as well as the box that says \\"Mikes Pastry\\" on it.  After that, we just took our daily pastry visit (lay off, I was on vacation) to Bova's."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"If I was assembling a phalanx of elite troops in a global tapas war, I'd select Little Donkey as one of the officers.\\n\\nTo be a member of an elite group of warriors, you need to prove that you can crush every type of physical demand.  You've got to be great at push-ups (\\"All the way down, all the way up, pussy!\\"), pull-ups (\\"I don't care if you have to chew on that bar.  GET UP THERE!\\"), running (\\"You move like a wet noodle, Butters.  This isn't a 5K for charity!\\"), and a lot more.\\n\\nUnfortunately, not everyone is good at everything.\\n\\nThat's why I steer south of restaurants that put a lot of items from a bunch of different cuisines on their menus.  But, unlike dimly-lit shitholes called 'Mahmood's Super Fantastic Restaurant and Pawn Shop: Burgers, Pizza, Gyro, Subs, Bloomin' Onion, & Shakes, open 24 hours,' Little Donkey actually does almost every dish well.\\n\\nI had: A Jamaican tapa, an Indian tapa, a Middle Eastern tapa, and a Chinese tapa.\\n\\nAll but the Middle Eastern tapa were fantastic.  And that's fine.  Like the Delta Force trainee who just squeezed by with 70 push-ups, but crushed everything else, I can forgive one weakness.\\n\\nJAMAICAN JERK CHICKEN WINGS\\nMy favorite one, the Jamaican tapa, consisted of six or seven plump wings with jerk sauce on them.  Jerk sauce is an inviting, spicy green sauce.  It's not luminescent-green like chimichurri.  It's a subdued green that nevertheless conveys how delicious it's going to be, like the coy, nerdy girl in your class who Mona Lisa-smiles at you and looks away.\\n\\nThen you finally take her home and she's a maniac.  You better have strong hips because when those glasses come off, she's going to drain you like a tub.\\n\\nThe heat of the jerk sauce hit the roof of my mouth first.  It made me take a cautious step back so I could let the flavors register.  The heat sat there, punching but not kicking, and the herby flavors rushed in after the heat.  The heat was like the guerrilla attack in the middle of the night: It got my attention but only to distract me from the massive infantry right behind it.\\n\\nOnce the flavors rushed in, the heat became tolerable and enjoyable.  I'm normally not so cautious with heat but I've been cooking a lot more at home these days and I'm starting to appreciate how important it is to exercise self-restraint with heat.  It's so potent, it can put some serious hurt on your taste buds and, eventually, your asshole.  This takes the fun out of it.\\n\\nIf I'm going to shit my brains out, it should at least be worth it.\\n\\nThat's why I try to focus on the rest of the flavors as well.  You can't build an army on special forces.  Little Donkey's jerk wings strike the military balance perfectly, a goal that was achieved in part by the charred bits of pineapple.\\n\\nI hate pineapple in or on food.  Seeing it on a pizza is like seeing a pigeon shit on your baby's head.  I want to lunge at the morons eating it and flick every piece of pineapple away.  I know this is America but maybe it should be Iceland.  Ban this atrocity.  Why don't we just put gummy bears on steaks while we're about it??\\n\\nBut, thoroughly charred and softened, and combined with a hot jerk sauce, pineapple worked.  Now, I never said it can't work.  I just said I haven't tasted food involving pineapple that DID work.  Until now.\\n\\nTHE LENTIL STEW\\nSpeaking of monstrous shits, INDIAN FOOD!  The lentil stew, or dhal, was the only vegetarian dish we ordered and it had plenty of flavor, and protein, to keep us satisfied.  I liked it but I don't see it on their menu anymore so it couldn't have been that popular.  That's okay because you could always get dhal at a real Indian restaurant if you just happen to have the very specific craving of a purely vegan source of protein in soup form, you fruit.\\n\\nTHE ORGANIC HOMMUS\\nThe barbari bread that came with it was what eating a sheet of silk would be like if silk was edible: It was soft, buttery, and slid down my throat effortlessly.  It also had griddle marks that gave it a beautiful char.  I ate it plain with a little salt.  I avoided the hommus because it was not good.  It was like a massage at a shady parlor but without the happy ending.  I waited for a burst of flavor and, like the client at the parlor, it never came.\\n\\nTHE KUNG PAO OCTOPUS HEAD\\nThis dish was by far the most colorful and chock-full of flavor.  An Asian dish is a great choice for octopus because its mild but distinct flavor lends itself well to the tangy sweetness of Asian flavors.  I'm starting to get used to octopus but I'm not there yet.  I like it cautiously.  That's why I was happy with the familiarity of scallions, peanuts, and soy sauce next to it.\\n\\nHaving said that, don't expect an authentic Kung Pao.  It's delicious, filling, and nutritious but it's a few logs short of a bundle.\\n\\nStill, little Donkey took shots in every direction and hit its mark almost every time, including with service, which was lightning-quick.  It was interesting enough that it made me want to go back."},{"name":"Pizza Garden New Westminster","address":"255-800 Carnarvon Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"4","text":"Called for pick up and was told 15-20 minutes , came to pick it up they hadn't put my order in yet .

You might have already eaten at this spot before because it is owned by the same people that run the Mellizoz Tacos trailer on South 1st.  This location has order service at the counter and it is brought to your table.  Menu is the same as Mellizoz.  Different type of Beef, chicken, pork, breakfast or veggie tacos.  Cost is around $3 - 4 depending on the taco.  Chips and salsa were average flavor.  They serve several different types of tortas and enchiladas.  Layout of the restaurant is low key and basic and they are open during the evenings.  I feel in between about this place.  I have eaten at Mellizoz's plenty but didnt think they are anywhere near to the best in town.  Location is certainly convenient for any lunch people in a nearby office.  Service was fast and friendly.  Food is certainly prepared well.  I have the same opinion on this place as Mellizoz, that the flavor isnt very bold in these tacos.  Certainly cooked well, but it is right around the middle ground for taco selection and taste.

This is not the first place we visit for DIY grilled meat/yakiniku. The difference with this place is how they give you super small sized portions, and they bring them veeeery slowly. Every portion is about the size of 1-2 american slices of bacon. They only bring like 2 at a time max, and if they see you have even one piece on the grill they won't bring any more. It's so slow that by the end of the meal I was hungry again. The grill was smoking because we hardly had anything to grill. Also, the \\"appetizer\\" selection was very limited. White Rice, edamame, fried veggies and sea weed. They have a \\"pay if you leave leftovers rule\\", so I was also pretty shocked that they bought us an order of vegetables we did not request and put it on the table. Also, lettuce. We ended up eating it anyway because we rarely had meat to grill. Also, if you add for 2 servings of anything, they will bring you one at a time, and sometimes they skip things when you ask for more than one thing. The tip was 18% mandatory, and definitively not deserved. The person was nice in manners, but did not bring all we asked for or in the amounts we asked for(maybe instructions from the kitchen?). We ended up leaving early just because it was tiring to wait for such small pieces of meat.There are better ways to spend your cash for better experience and amount of food close by. By the way, this was not  considered when reviewing, but to lessen even more the value, if you wish to add sushi, you have to pay $4.00 per ROLL; this is crazy since many good quality places have sushi, sashimi and appetizers(real appetizers) included with no extra cost.They have a lot of room for improvement."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Food is bordering inedible but the drinks and view make it a worthwhile trip.

They offer vegan eggs in the am so I will definitely be going back for that and to try all the other things they have to offer! I see this place doing very well!

Our waiter Cole had great suggestion for food and drinks!"},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I almost made the fatal mistake of missing Pip's Doughnuts before we left for home because I mistakenly thought it was open later than it actually was. It was recommended by almost everybody to make sure I try Pip's, and after a relatively meh Portland trip, I'm happy that I was able to make it and end the trip with a bang. \\n\\nPip's is a doughnut and (chai) coffee shop in the Northeast area of Portland that opens daily at 8AM and closes at 4PM. We headed out as soon as we were up and packed, and made it to the shop at around 9, fearing that the line would be crazy. Surprisingly there weren't too many people in the shop, so I actually got a chance to take pictures and sit down before hopping into the car. \\n\\nSo Pip's is a doughnut shop that churns out hundreds (maybe thousands) of little mini doughnuts, slightly bigger than a doughnut hole throughout the day so that they get to you piping hot and fresh. When I think of the word pip, I think of something small/quick/minute. That's what you get with these doughnuts! They may be small in size but they pack a big punch of flavor! \\n\\nYou order the doughnuts by quantity - either four ($3.95), six ($5.95), eight ($6.95), or twelve ($7.95). You are limited to 4 dozen per visit. They have a variety of flavors - not sure how often they change, but on the day I visited, there was cinnamon sugar, raw honey and sea salt, Nutella and sea salt, candied bacon maple, the Dirty Wu (cinnamon sugar with Nutella and honey), and the season flavor - blackberry lavender. If you buy four, you basically pay $1 for one small doughnut, which isn't too worth it. I would say order more because they're so small to consume that you'll be done with 4 and you won't even realize it!\\n\\nI ordered two of each flavor as well as a cup of cold brew for the road. Not a big fan of Chai, but I've heard it's pretty good. Because of the open kitchen, you can see them churning out the doughnuts and sprinkling cinnamon, etc. which was really cool. I ordered them for here because I wanted the whole picture experience, which was super encouraged by the worker. \\n\\nWhile all the flavors were good, I think I preferred the sweeter ones. I would say that the raw honey and sea salt was the one I could do without because it was quite plain and a little on the salty side. But it was super fresh and doughy and slightly crispy on the outside, yet fluffy and pillow-like on the inside. I'm also not a fan of Nutella, so the Dirty Wu and Nutella & sea salt were just okay for me. Bacon maple was unique - I liked the sweetness of the doughnut with the savory hit of bacon afterwards. \\n\\nBut my favorites were definitely the cinnamon sugar and the blackberry lavender. Cinnamon sugar reminded me of a churro - loved the slight crackling as I bit into the doughnut before getting that warm and fluffy interior. But the blackberry lavender - while I couldn't get much lavender taste, I really liked the slight acidity of the berry along with the sweetness of the doughnut itself and the powdered sugar. It went really well together and kept the flavors interesting. I kind of regret not getting another dozen! \\n\\nThe cold brew - $4.25 - was also really good. Sometimes I feel like cold brews are too bitter, but the one here was really smooth and not too bitter. Loved the freshness of taste! Drinks are the same price for small, medium, and large (for all the coffees), so we went with the large.\\n\\nI also thought the interior of the shop was really cute. Felt very homey and the workers were all super friendly and very, very ... chill (is the only word that I can describe) because of their super accommodating ways. They have window bar seating that allows you to people watch, but the decorations are pretty aesthetically pleasing and perfect for photos. I've seen pictures of the Chai flight and they have looked amazing. The bathrooms were also really clean. \\n\\nI really wish they had a location in LA, especially seeing their birthday deal offer where you can get a dozen for free as long as you bring your ID and come within a week of your birthday. And don't forget to check in on Yelp for a discount on your order! \\n\\ntl;dr - LOVE, love Pip's and the fact that each doughnut is so miniature that you can eat several and not even feel guilty. Saw so many people walk out with several boxes of doughnuts (probably for the office) and I couldn't help but be jealous of the people that were going to eat them! Pricing is not bad at all, and I love the friendliness of the staff here. Highly recommend you try Pip's if you're in Portland and grab yourself some of these popular miniature doughnuts. In my opinion, they're better than Blue Star and Voodoo - especially when you eat them right away!"},{"name":"Flying Pie Pizzeria","address":"16691 SE Mcloughlin Blvd","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"3.5","text":"The pizza here is fantastic.

There was another waiter that assisted that was very friendly and engaging. They both checked on us often  throughout the meal. I did not feel rushed at all as some mentioned. They were very accommodating.\\n\\n  Since it was early we were given lunch menus that do not list the steaks as an option. He brought dinner menus. We asked about drink options after requesting water. He said they had wine, scotch, bourbon, and ability to make almost any drink. Most of the specialty cocktails offered were gin based.  I am not a gin drinker.  He did mention the Ray's Mai Tai was good so I ordered that. I have had better Mai Tais so would not suggest it.\\n\\n  We had the shrimp and calamari appetizer.

The asparagus was cooked perfectly and mashed potatoes were buttery and finely whipped. The lobster mac was okay. I could not put my finger  on what cheese was in it but 1 threw me off. It was good but not $25 good. The Delmonico steak was requested to be medium well.

I am a little obsessed with Disney more like Mickey but, you can't love Mickey without loving and understanding the magic behind Disney.\\n\\nDuring my recent visit to Disney Springs, ever since my move, I realized there was no nightclubs there which of course is a great thing. But, for nightclub goers, if you want to shake it up or dance the night away there's a ton of nightclubs in Downtown Orlando as well as a few on International Drive near the Orlando Eye."},{"name":"MAC‚ÄôD","address":"5145 SE McLoughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I really like what they are doing with this idea of a glorious mac & cheese shop but I was a little disappointed by the pricing.

Because of the two dollar add-on for having cauliflower my Mac and it up being $13 then when you go to pay by card they auto prompt you to tip a minimum of 18-25% Tip. Not sure why they think a minimum of 18% is necessary when it's just a window pick up basically a food cart that is a brick-and-mortar.

So hubby and I got two orders of tacos, the pork carnitas and the fish tacos.  Each order came with three big tacos, more chips and a little cup of non-descript, average queso.  But the tacos were GOOD!  I had to do a double take, like I said, to make sure I was in the right place.  I was expecting your run of the mill sports bar fare, and there's plenty of that to be sure.

Main event here is they steam all seafood here, fresh and raw with no seasoning, with congee cooking at the bottom of the steamer supposedly soaking up the juices dripped off from the seafood above.  The seafood were indeed very delicious, they tasted very sweet and fresh.  The congee/porridge was quite tasty and comforting too, but it did feel short in contrast, especially vis a vis our anticipation of juice-infused flavour.  \\n\\nNot knowing where to start, we chose the Fish Dinner Set and were offered to substitute with snow crab for a small price because they were out of the proper fish that evening.  Very pleased with this substitution (lucky!).  The set consists of one choice of congee, one appetizer, a salad, a snow crab (vis-a-vis fish), fresh scallops, fresh New Zealand clams, fresh prawns, beef with enoki mushroom, vegetable platters, and cheesecake as desserts.  Portions were generous, you get one scallop, 3-4 prawns, 6-7 clams per person, all decent sizes not cheap/tiny.  Once we've had the congee, we felt very full.  \\n\\nThere is a sauce bar where you can mix your own sauce.  From garlic to cilantro, soy sauce to hot chili paste, there is a variety to select.  They also have their own signature sauces, a unique one being \\"blueberry signature sauce\\" - yes it indeed has a strong sweet flavour of blueberry.  I do not know how I feel about blueberry and seafood, but I don't hate this sauce. I just do not have a strong passion about it.  \\n\\nAs the seafood and vegetable arrived, our server put them into the steamers without jamming everything in.  A timer on the table to minimize overcooking.  The Scallops and Clams were succulent and juicy, the meat were good and chewy.  Prawns were nothing surprising but still good.  Snow crab was very good, we dismantled the crab with our hands and ate each string of meats.  \\n\\nThe congee was slow-cooked over steam (not direct fire) with very little broth, so it was thick. They used a mix of long grain rices and mullets so the texture was different.  We chose mushroom and chicken, a very comforting mix, one you want to eat on a sick day.  I did notice juice dripped down to the congee but I didn't believe that would've added enough of a flavour to make an impression, evidently so.  Still judging the congee alone, it was still quite good.  We could only have the congee in the end when we were done with the steamed food on top obviously.  The menu said \\"cheesecake factory\\" for our dessert so I'm not sure if it was from cheesecake factory or just a name but it was a good - thick and creamy, no complaint.  We finished all our food and adopted a big belly.  \\n \\nPrice is definitely on the higher tier, seems to be a new norm these days, but the quality, variety, and portion of seafood we got definitely were reasonable and worth the price.  Not to mention the service attendants provided in steaming/serving the food for you at the table.   Overall, a very satisfying meal!"},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I suppose the agreement we have with airport travel is that we should not get our hopes up for any form of decent food...just grab and go...hope for the best.

Could just be a bad mood, but after having to wait a long time to get my food (the original pancakes), it gave me time to hear just how bad of an attitude she has. Brunch is not very enjoyable when you can hear this specific employee screaming into the kitchen that when the manager gets there, they're getting fired and her huffy attitude when another customer accidentally dropped a cup and it broke was a dealbreaker for me coming back to this establishment. Not to mention that the quality of the food was below average. The pancakes tasted as if they could come from a store bought mix, the cream that came with it tasted and had the same texture as cool whip, and honestly the fresh berries on top was the best part.

As the years passed, I have eaten fried chicken in a variety of other places, and as willing as I might be to try it, I'm often left disappointed by the quality.\\n\\nHowever, that was definitely NOT the case at HCT. I went in expecting pretty good things based on the reviews I've seen, but still being fairly cautious. My husband and I arrived fairly early, and there was already a bit of a line, but it moved along pretty quickly and everybody seemed to be in a pretty good mood, Parking was pretty easy in the lot (though some people seemed to have difficulty w/ the concept of not blocking the exit). All of the people working at HCT were quite pleasant and accommodating which always makes a food experience better.\\n\\nThen there's the food. The food is so good. I mean, the chicken itself is juicy and flavorful, and the skin is delightfully crispy. Now my husband is a spice lightweight so he went with the cold level of heat, and while he did enjoy it, he did say that there was definitely some spice to it. Before we ordered, I asked about the quality of the two spiciest levels because as a lifelong lover of spicy foods, it's been my experience that some places will sacrifice flavor for the sake of just making something super spicy. But I was assured that was not the case here and that all of the levels maintained good flavor and were well liked amongst patrons. Bearing that in mind, I decided to go all the way and try the Holy, which is the highest level of heat that they offer. It was definitely seriously spicy, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not the type of person that really likes spicy food, but it was SO good. And while I could taste the spice in every bite, it didn't linger in my mouth for very long. At most, it hung out on my lips for a while, but I didn't mind that. Plus, you do get bread, sides, and ranch to help temper the heat. And speaking of sides, I'm not really a cole slaw fan, but I did enjoy the mac n cheese quite a bit. It was just the right level of cheesy. I'm also not an iced tea fan, but my husband said it was really good.\\n\\nNext time, I plan to try the Hot level, just to see how it compares to the Holy. I also want to try that banana pudding because it looked pretty yummy as well."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"what a lovely brunch experience. arrive early if you can. crunchy French toast is what brunch dreams are made of! so good.

The place is immaculate, though not as stocked with snacks as some other places. The bread is baked fresh daily from their oven. During happy hours, 3-6, they're buy 3 for a dolla, and get 1 free. They're mainly a sub-specialty store, although they do sell noodles dishes. \\n\\nI love this place and think everyone should give this place a try because the owners are ethical, honest, hard-working people. They truly care about their business and customers. They approached my family and me with unmatched sincerity and concern for our satisfaction. For instance, we were going to load up on the bread seeing how it was 4 for $1 and the owner told us to wait a little bit for fresh bread to come out of the oven. While we were waiting he brought out a generous plate of Vietnamese ham for 5 of us to sample, along with a piece of flan and fermented rice! WTH?! How nice is that!? Not only that, he brought over some salt and peppa and shared with us how he likes to eat the Vietnamese ham with the fresh-baked bread he bought out for us. \\n\\nHe was very tactful and not pushy. He genuinely believed in his products. I like that and I believe Lee's Bakery deserves a shout - out from me. Also, we ordered about 20 subs for the road and I liked that they were conscientious enough to pack the herbs, jalepenos, and pickled veggies separately as to not taint the flavor. \\n\\nFor their conscientiousness and effort.

Ray Ray's is a little BBQ cart located in the parking lot of the Super Mart at Pacemont and High.  It's no-frills; the only beverage they had when I was there was birch beer (pretty sure it was birch beer).  Luckily, they are in the parking lot of a convenience store, so what they don't have, you can pop in and get.\\n\\nHow stupid delicious is this place?  IT IS FANTASTIC.  We're kind of having \\"budget dates\\" right now and we had no idea what the side dishes would run us, so we stuck to sandwiches; I had the brisket and my husband had the pulled pork.  After popping into Super Mart for chips and tea in a can, we were off to the park to enjoy a lovely picnic with our foil-wrapped (not Styrofoam-encased--I guess you don't get 'foam if you don't order sides) sandwiches.  The flavor of the meat was heavenly smoky, the meat was tender and not dried out--although, I did get a lot of the hard outer crust of the brisket in large chunks, so I had to disassemble my sandwich to break them into edible bite-sizes.  It was a big sandwich on a hoagie-type bun, quite filling for $4-6, but even if it were half the size, it's so good it'd be worth the price.\\n\\nThe only gripe I have about Ray Ray's--well, two, actually.  Two small ones.  One is that they skimped on our napkins--we got a napkin each for sticky barbecue.  That's a minor, baby complaint; if they gave us no napkins I'd still go back; I'd go back if they tied my hands behind my back and made me eat it with my feet.  My other complaint is that they don't have onion and dill pickle for my sandwich, which I'm used to getting at just about any other barbecue place.  The naked sandwich with just meat and sauce is stellar, but I like the little bite from raw onions and kosher dills to offset the sweet smokiness of the meat.  I know that once they start adding things here and there it makes the price go up, and I wouldn't expect them to go adding in all kinds of different condiments--but onion and pickle is pretty common for BBQ sandwiches in other places, and it's all one really needs to complement the tangy, smoky goodness.  Next time, I will come prepared with my own raw onion and pickle.

It's like fried soft tofu in a bowl of watered down soy sauce with MSG. That dish was over $5 for like a third or a quarter of a block of tofu. It probably cost them less than a buck to make.

We ordered four drumsticks for $6.50 which is an incredible deal. You can get wings or a dark or light quarter or a bone-in/boneless breast also for around $7. \\n\\nOr you can get a sandwich for $9.50, which comes with DOUBLE side scoops of macaroni and cheese (be still my mac'n cheese lovin' heart...).

First, we were sat right away, which was great. It took another 10mins for a waitress to take our order and another 40mins before we received our food. Couple things that I noticed in those 40mins was that NO ONE in the restaurant had food at their table but wait staff brought out everything for the buffet bar that was clearly not open yet. Once the buffet was finished you slowly started to see food come out to the tables. Two things, FOH manager was clearly not present or doing their job. No one came to update anyone's tables on the delay nor did anyone seem to care. Kitchen, either get more staff to do both buffet prep and service or pick one to do on busy mornings. For the chef or kitchen manager, man, you got a lot of work to do. Food had no flavor and was boring. The Irish curry sausages tasted like hot dogs. Honestly, the entire thing was a disaster and you should all be ashamed to be in service. There were too many people working there doing nothing because there was no leadership. You're clearly pooling tips, literally stop doing that because it's not working or keeping your FOH team accountable. Get new leadership or you will be closed in 6months.

I've been here quite a few times and really like it for brunch/lunch. They have a mix of traditional Jewish items such as latkes and kugel, and more American breakfast items, like omlettes and benedicts.\\n\\nThey do not take reservations, and the wait can often be 30-45 mins on weekends, however they give you a buzzer which has a bit of range (although they say you can't go too far), so you can pass the time by exploring Coolidge corner! Often, the actual wait is shorter than the quoted wait. The restaurant itself is a little dirty and very simple, but people don't come here for the ambiance anyway! Service is homey and friendly. The waiters always make you feel welcome and you can tell they're proud of the restaurant.\\n\\nOnto the food--this time I ordered the loaded latke with cheddar, bacon, scallions, tomatoes, and sour cream. I got a side of the turkey hash. The latke was the perfect size if you're not super hungry. There were 3 latkes and ample melted cheddar which I was very much a fan of. Fried potatoes, cheese, bacon--what more could you ask for? The turkey hash was somewhat dry and bland, so I wouldn't recommend this. My friend got the breakfast burrito and he was very satisfied. In the past I've gotten the Challah French toast with strawberries and it's AMAZING. The portion size is huge, so you can share with a friend or have a second brunch at home!

When we asked for \\"ha gao\\", they sent us \\"siu mai\\" (what the??). The only time I found the waiter attentive was at the end of our meal (Total $60).

How about cramped tables and mediocre waitstaff? Then Zaftigs is for you!\\n\\nI usually try to keep an open mind but I confess, I had expectations coming into here. A few Yelp pals of mine had positive things to say and well, shoot, if its supposed to be some sort of landmark for Brookline, then it MUST be good right?\\n\\nWalking in, the place lacked a sort of put-togetherness. Neon lights at the front, a slew of memorabilia, campy artwork scattered about the restaurant (it reminded me of that style you see at the back of TJMaxx in the artwork section), and then the kitchen in the back that's almost diner looking but not so cramped.\\n\\nThis \\"new-Jewish\\" restaurant has a variety of food items to offer: sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups, appetizers and a few entrees. The menu layout itself was very diner-esque and, of course, the vegan selection was pretty limited.\\n\\nI settled on the grilled veggie wrap with fries and my friend got the mac & cheese. We decided to also get a glass of their \\"premium wine\\" for giggles (Chateau St. Michelle Cab Sauv, not bad).\\n\\nThe wine came out in a pretty goofy looking juice glass. I mean it had a stem, but barely. Instead of bread we were given bagel chips and a creamy herb cheese; definitely an interesting concept.\\n\\nOnce food came I went immediately for the pickle spear sitting next to my wrap. It. was. so. good. Fresh, a good texture/flavor balance, and made me want more. As for the wrap... ehhh... I was so underwhelmed by the overcooked flavors of zucchini, peppers and onion. I felt like they had been steamed- not so much grilled. And, it was contained in this pretty heavy and super starchy wrap bread. Not a particularly good match. The fries were sort of meaty tasting so after trying one I was done. I understand not wanting to change fryer oil, but that sort of lingering taste seems to occur when the oil hasn't been changed in a while. After sitting dissatisfied and not wanting to eat the food in front of me, I snagged a bite of my companion's mac & cheese. It was so bland. Like, more bland then if you made noodles and mozzarella. I still can't figure out what sort of cheese they must have used to get something so boring.\\n\\nSo, summary: if you'd like to spend $12-$20 on diner food and enjoy listening in on others' conversations from 1.5 ft away, head to this place. I personally think I'll be fine with never coming back."},{"name":"Denny's","address":"25 Town Center Blvd","city":"Clermont","stars":"2.5","text":"Food was OK, pancakes way over done.

There wasn't an obvious system for ordering so there were lines here and there, but no one seemed ready to order when the staff would holler out \\"next\\".  Once you made your way to the counter you quickly needed to respond to \\"next\\" and rattle off the types of cannolis you wanted.  Given the sheer number of people in the shop, you want to get your cannolis and then get out of the way. Don't bother with credit cards or Apple Pay. Mike's accepts cask only. \\n\\nI'm generally not a fan of cannolis, but Mike's has changed my opinion of them. Of the three that I purchased, the Florentine was my fave. Followed by the ricotta.

The food was good. They sold cup Ramen for three dollars, which was a little steep in my opinion, but I understand they have a business to run. The overall experience was OK, but was completely ruined by the waitress. Some of us had two transactions. I had two transactions that were only $1 dollar apart. I tipped 25% on the lesser charge, and I did not tip on top on the larger. The rest of my party paid either with card or cash, but all were going to tip only in cash. Before we even had the chance to lay the money on the table the waitress stops us and starts asking if we are going to tip and complained to me that I tipped only on one of my two transactions. She wanted me to double tip her. She also went back and forth with my friends for a few minutes. All of them were trying to tell her they were tipping in cash but she didn't seem to understand? None of us appreciated being hassled for not leaving a tip especially when some of us already had and the rest planned too do so. It was quite rude and to be honest our waitress didn't greet us when we came in, only came to our table maybe three times. Once to put down water, once to take the order, and once to bring the food. I have never had a bad experience like this at a restaurant before and it really got under my skin that she was going to complain about a tip before we even had the chance to leave one.

This hotel is in serious need of updated decor; our room appeared to be circa 1975 with furnishings being drab, drapes partially off the rods and the king size bed very old and \\"rickety\\".  No blanket on the bed, just a sheet and a very thin drab (beige-ish) bedspread that creeped me out.   We booked the \\"Presidential Suite\\" at close to $200/ night at this hotel because we were part of a wedding and staying the night with our infant daughter.  When I made the reservation, I called the hotel directly and asked for a suite so we could bring a babysitter with us.  We were told the room had a separate bedroom and a pull out couch in the living room and two bathrooms.  I asked for an early check in (2pm vs 3pm) so we would have time to get settled before we had to depart for the wedding and was told that \\"would not be a problem\\".    When we arrived at 2:30, our room \\"wasn't ready\\".  After waiting, we got in and it was clear that this room had not been used for quite some time.  It was stiffling hot in the room and took about an hour to cool off.  Worse, the second bathroom had a sign posted \\"out of order\\" on the door thereby leaving us with only one bathroom that was through the master.   When we opened the door marked \\"out of order\\" we noted the entire ceiling in the bathroom had collapsed and the drywall was falling down and in pieces in the tub.  I felt like I was in an abandoned building.  Also, no pull out couch.   I wasn't very excited about having our 19 year old babysitter tip toe throught our bedroom to use the bathroom during the night (awkward for all of us)  so my husband called the front desk to complain.  To his credit the front desk clerk did his best to appologize for what was clearly an unacceptable room and offered to move us to two separate rooms although since they were not ajoining we didn't see this as feasible for our babysitter to be able to put our baby to bed as she would not be able to leave the room and would have to sit quietly in the dark until we got back. \\n\\nI gave the hotel one star because the staff was apologetic and tried to help us albeit unsuccessfully and a second star because despite the completely unacceptable condition of our \\"room\\" the one nice thing about it was it had a nice view of the flatirons in Boulder.  But, this room should NEVER have been reserved for a guest and frankly needs to be gutted completely.  I think a best western or anything better than a super 8 would be nicer.

The server was friendly, efficient and pre bussed, no complaints on service. IF only the food and desserts matched in taste to the rest of the themed restaurant. The food was not good. My son's dry grilled chicken w/rice and my daughter's waffle/bacon off the kids menu were the best tasting items on the table. The cheeseburger was bland and I didn't know you could order slice cheese that thin, the pretzel bun was too much, it overwhelmed the tasteless burger adding to the lack of flavor and was hard to the point of feeling stale. The onion rings, bland, just blah as was those odd tasting chicken wings. Incorporating chocolate into almost every recipe may not have been a good idea, in concept, but not in taste. We ordered to save room for desserts, which looked amazing and that's about it. The mousse was unedible, it tasted like powdered chocolate air whipped into a gel like consistency that was intense for even the most devout chocolate lover. IDK what kind of ice cream they use for their shakes but there is a fine line between enjoyable and disagreeable and they found it. The Chocolate Creme Brule' my husband ordered was the best tasting dessert we ordered and it tasted like true mousse with a thin crusted top layer...simple and I don't even think most would consider it a true creme brule'. We are a dessert loving family so my recommendation would be to order two and split amongst your party.

It's like a cupcake vs. a mini-cupcake (and everyone knows mini-cupcakes are abominable). \\n\\nBut, given the limitations of the above study, I would say that I preferred the crisp, crunchy shell at Modern. It was also more pleasant and less dramatic being able to fit a mini cannoli in one's mouth within a few bites. Much less messy.

There are fewer cannoli permutations, only 2-3 filling/topping choices.

When we lived in DC we usually to loyally visit Pho Viet on 14th Street and always got their spicy lemongrass pho. We recently discovered that it was essentially b√∫n b√≤ hue broth, so we usually just ask for the broth in a pho dish since we don't eat pork. \\n\\nWe had been to Pho With Us a few times before- the service was always mediocre. The last time we ate their food, we ordered takeout from their website. We showed up 30 minutes after we ordered and they apparently experienced downtime on their website. There was not an even an apology or offer to make it right (usually restaurants would give an app for free or comp a portion of the meal). \\n\\nToday, we decided to visit Pho With Us. It's closer to our apartment and the food is generally pretty decent. We entered the building, requested a booth, and took a seat on the bench until we were seated while they swept under the booth. \\n\\nOnce seated, we waited about 3-4 minutes before the host came by to say that the server was busy but that he could take our drink order. We both ordered waters and let him know that we were ready to order if he was able to get our orders. He acknowledged that he could and grabbed a pen and paper. We ordered pho with the spicy lemongrass broth, but he responded stating that he wasn't sure if they could make substitutions of that nature. I politely asked if he would mind checking. He leaves our table and talks to another server and returns to our table to tell us that they're unable to. He didn't even attempt to ask the kitchen - the people who prepare the food. We wind up ordering regular pho. My boyfriend requests a side of finely chopped lemongrass to accompany his bowl of pho. \\n\\nWe finally get our bowls of pho- well one of them. The food runner made the mistake of not stabilizing the tray the bowls were on. My boyfriend's bowl then (in what feels like slow motion) tips towards the guy. I honestly felt really bad because that broth had to have burned. The soup was all spread out across the floor. I should add that they forgot lemongrass. \\n\\nThe server comes by to ask us to relocate. I'd be lying to say I wasn't disappointed about being asked to move to a table when we had requested to be sat at a booth. We move to a table and she assists us in carrying over my bowl of pho, the carafe of water, and our glasses. Before she brings out the other bowl of pho, I thankfully check my bowl and I'm missing meatballs from my rare steak, flank, and meatball pho. My boyfriend reminds her of the lemongrass before she heads back to the kitchen. \\n\\nShe comes back out and delivers additional meatballs and lemongrass. My boyfriend finally receives his bowl of pho. \\n\\nThe food was good, no complaints there. The server presents the check and they comped $4 off of the meal. We pay. We leave. \\n\\nI'm thankful they at least apologized this time and took $4 off of our meal. \\n\\nI'm really just upset with the level of customer service of this place.  The host seemed annoyed the moment we walked into the restaurant for requesting a booth. It was not our fault that the booth wasn't cleaned. We didn't mind having to wait for it. He also seemed annoyed when we asked about making the substitution for broth. Again, we wouldn't have minded waiting longer for a response from the KITCHEN and would have gladly paid extra for the swap. Your loss on extra revenue, Pho With Us. We were trying to give you our hard earned money. \\n\\nMight as well call this place Pho Without Us now.\\n\\nSide note, after making this review we did receive a response from the business to apologize.

It was flavorful with spicy tuna, cream cheese and avocado but wrapped in a crunch crust. The Kentucky was not overly exciting but as described and I appreciated the chickens inside was not fried. We sampled their spring rolls which were served steaming hot but I didn't love some vegetable inside that had a strange taste like ginger but stronger.

We ended up not going on the tour this go around (but I can't wait to go back and try it), and were more interested in consuming the drinks and food. \\n\\nTheir drink menu is amazing, they feature about 20 cocktails or so, made with an array of their spirits. Some of our favorite drinks were the \\"Sencha been gone\\", made with Waterloo gin, honey-dew melon, sencha green tea, and lemongrass. And the \\"Prickly Pear Daiquiri\\", made with treaty oak rum, lime, and prickly pear juice. We then wanted to try some of their food, since you should never drink on an empty stomach, and we went with their \\"Chili rubbed smoked pork tacos\\", and the \\"Brisket Panini\\".

My family and I had just arrived from a 6+ hour drive from Atlanta, and I was on the hunt for a good cheeseburger.  The obvious choice was Hard Rock, but we go to a HR in nearly every town we go to (not taking anything away, the food and atmosphere are great there, too), but my better half convinced me to try this place out, and I'm glad she did.  \\n\\nWe skipped the appetizer, as we just wanted to eat good food.\\n\\nI ordered a burger, the \\"Pub it Up\\" to be precise, and wow, I immediately noticed the fresh-off-the-grilled flavor hit me, I took a bite before putting on the queso and mustard sides it came with, and was floored, adding the queso and cheese just improved the flavor, and made it messy!  In a good way of course.\\n\\nI can't speak on the chips, as I don't remember them that well, but I ate those, too, so they must have been good.\\n\\nI also had a beer, it's a chocolate concoction brewed locally (can't find the name, Two Chocolate Stout, I think), but it reminded me of Guinness with some heavy chocolate tones (breathe it in through your nose as you take a sip, trust me!).\\n\\nNow, the desert, there are three of us, it was getting late, so we split a \\"May Contain Nuts Sundae\\"...and my god, if you take nothing from this review, take this, eat light, it's clear the dessert is the star of the show, and they give you about a 10 inch bowl and it's nearly overflowing.  With all three of us, we may have knocked off about half before we gave up. Even my daughter who loves these treats had enough.\\n\\nIf you've been to Hard Rock before, but not Toothsome's, give it a try.

I took the time to read online reviews to find a comfortable place to enjoy a delicious meal as I'm not from the area. I can honestly say I'm all of my 40+ years I've never had been more disappointed in a sushi establishment. Maybe on off night? I won't know because I will not be returning. I waited at least 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged my presence. I finally had the chance to peruse the menu and was quickly ready to place my order. Again waited for an incredible amount of time for the server to realize I was ready. I'm a patient person and should have followed my gut to leave at that point. I finally order six pieces of nigiri and a roll. I forgot the name of the roll but it was $16.95. Again, an incredible wait. Now I'm starving and know that if I leave I may make a wrong decision. You know-hoping that the wait was worth it!? Big NO. The sushi roll was maybe the diameter of a roll of nickels. For $16.95 I fully except a size-able and gracious serving of all things yummy. I was unable to eat the role with my chop sticks as the rice was so loosely packed it fell to shred instantly. I abandon ship because at this point I can't eat it without a fork and move along to the nigiri. Did you know that sushi has tendons? I didn't! I hope that you never know what it's like to pull stringy worm like, \\"tendons\\"' from the middle of your raw fish. Again, never once in my many many years of sushi dining had I experienced this. Again, I was unable to enjoy the nigiri as it fell apart almost immediately. Appetite officially lost. The waiter was kind and asked how my meal was and I was honest. I showed him I was unable to eat my food without a fork or spoon due to the poor preparation. I sat again for ten minutes with no utensils beside the unusable sticks. I'm now standing up waiting for someone to help me. I wanted to leave because now I'm exhausted AND hungry for something I'm clearly not going to get here. If you want subpar sushi with string like, \\"tendons\\" as the chef affectionately called them-please proceed with caution. I'm whole heartedly shocked this establishment had such great review and again I'm hopeful that my experience was isolated.

We liked but didn't love it, but the presentation was so much fun. All in all, this is a really fun and delicious place to go for a date or with a friend. It's the kind of place that eating dinner at feels like an evening perfectly spent."},{"name":"Hyatt Regency - Austin","address":"208 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"As far as the Hyatt Regency group of hotels tends to go this is the only time I have had a pretty bad and somewhat concerning experience at one of their hotels. I will preface this by saying that I pre-booked this room several months in advance using a normal website I've used for several dozen bookings, and I do not blame anything that occured on how or when I booked. I will also start with the good before the bad.\\n\\nThe Good: The hotel itself is very clean and organized with a huge lobby and commons area that is very aesthetic and easy on the eyes after a long days travel with oversized couches and chairs for relaxing. The valet out front was very nice and was able to give us information on places to eat and things to see in town. At first check in the man at the front desk was very nice and it was very easy and painless to check in and get to our room.\\n\\nWe had a standard king room which itself was really nice. The bed was clean and not broken in any way, with a large bathroom with space for multiple people to get ready comfortably, same for the shower. The air system also worked which for me is the main thing I usually have issue with, but it was easy to control and worked throughout our 4 day stay.\\n\\nThe Bad: First thing to mention is that the parking garage for the Hyatt is $27 a day which is pretty high considering it was on the outskirt of the main city and part of the hotel itself it shouldn't be nearly that high. Those are the same prices I can find in downtown Denver proper, and even then realistically most are about $10 less. The only good thing from that is you can use your hotel room key to come and go from the garage without needing a new parking ticket, however the charged just get billed to your room.\\n\\nOur room itself was not even joking, located 6 ft away from 4 elevators. The design of the hotel room layout, means that on every single floor there is at least 3 rooms that are within mere feet of 4 elevators, which as you can imagine makes it really difficult to sleep with paper thin walls and 4 elevators going up and down all the time. Normally when I check in I am asked if near the elevator is ok or at least shown on the hotel map to see if its ok, but this time it was a surprise. That next morning after no sleep we were able to change rooms and they put us opposite of the elevators which was nice.\\n\\nThe biggest downfall that we had was with a very simple thing of creamer and cups for the room coffee. I know its a small thing but the following went down was a true glimpse to me into the customer service of the hotel itself. About 8pm we called to have some more creamer and cups sent up to the room. 45 minutes later we were given a small cup of cream from the kitchen and the ceramic coffee mugs. Not sure why it took 45 minutes, but ok. The next night the same problem arose as still out of creamer and called room service this time and asked for the table creamer again to which they transferred us to the kitchen and then hung up on us when we had to clarify what we wanted. We called back twice with no answer. Then called the front desk to which we were put on hold for about 10 minutes, but not on actual hold as we could still hear a couple ladies talking about their instagram photos. We hung up and walked down to the lobby and asked them face to face and the lady said she would take care of it. On the way back up to our room there was a plastic trash bag filled with the disposable coffee creamers numbering 27 (we counted) and a couple of the paper starbucks cups. Called back down and clarified for the kitchen cream as before and 2 hours later we still had no creamer and went back down to the front desk now manned by a new woman who said she would talk to the kitchen and get it. Finally about 25 minutes later a nice young guy brought us what we asked for almost 3 hours later. \\n\\nDespite to what we now refer to as the Creamer Adventure and having to change rooms which was pretty painless to change, the hotel itself was really enjoyable. The bed and cleanliness of the room was amazing, and everything else expected or wanted was taken care of or already provided. I'm not sure however if I would stay there again however other than the cost of the room itself which was about half the price of other Hyatt Regency's."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"My rating system is a possible star for: food, drinks, service, ambiance, and \\"other.\\"\\n\\nFood: No star.

That says a lot since pizza is never truly high on my list for dinner! \\n\\nBrace yourself when you visit- this seems to be the hot spot on Curry Ford and already seems to have a huge local following. The parking may be an issue since they're located in a small business plaza. I was lucky to pull in as someone was pulling out. \\n\\nMy friends and I came here for dinner and there was already a wait for tables. If you're not particularly picky, you can opt to sit at the community table with other diners. We ended up doing just that. The space is comfy with several tables taking up about half of the restaurant, a bar and the community table we were at but space does fill fast and the wait can be long if diners tend to linger. Also, this place is loud. Probably not the best for a quiet conversation but that wouldn't stop me from coming back. \\n\\n For starters , we were brought a complimentary bowl of olives. I also ordered the garlic knots for our group to share. When our server brought them out, I marveled at how massive they were. Like the size of Princess Leia's buns, lol!  We all ate them with a fork and knife dipping them in the marinara sauce. Soo good!  They were doughy and extra garlicky- perfect combination! As far as pizza goes, they have plenty of options. I opted to \\"build my own\\" - you pick white or red sauce(I picked red) and they have 3 separate lists of toppings based on $ charge. I added red onions, mushrooms, calabrian chilis and a farm raised egg.  I was pleasantly surprised but even moreso by the egg. The pizza dough is thin and can be eaten fork and knife style while that crust is doughy. One pizza is more than enough for 1 person. All 3 of us each ordered our own pizza and shared but we each still had plenty of leftovers.  I also noticed they have several salads on the menu if you want to add some greens to your meal. \\nThey also have a wine/beer list . I had the cider - they served in a glass which I always prefer. \\nWe ended the meal with the canoli. While it was good, it was just a little too sweet for my taste. I was impressed to hear that they are made fresh, in house, as is everything served here. \\n\\nAlready looking forward to my next visit back and it's probably a good thing this place isn't close to home..."},{"name":"Hello Chicken","address":"5295 Buford Hwy Ne","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Been here several times and have not been disappointed! \\nThe chicken is perfectly fried and sauced.

He was instructed to seat us at table 122, which was apprently already taken up, so thinking quickly he took us to another table (136, I believe) only to find that the table had not been bussed yet. Being courteous and trying to do his best, the young man seated us at a larger top table rather than having us awkwardly saunter back indoors to wait for a table ... Which is what should've happened in the first place to avoid all of this. \\n\\nOnce seated at the larger table, a few minutes pass before one female who had been standing at the hostess stand earlier comes by to give us a strange look and proceeds to ask if we had been seated there by someone, we respond \\"yes,\\" but what we were thinking was, \\"no, we just happened to stroll right past the host stand while being somehow undetected, grabbed menus from wherever it is they are held, and grabbed the first table we saw (which by the way was not easily visible).\\"\\n\\nAnyway, some more time passes and a different female who was also standing at the hostess stand earlier decides to come and rather than say, \\"someone will be with you shortly,\\" or, \\"someone will be right over to take your order,\\" she decides to ask the same question we had already been asked once more, only this time with a more annoyed tone. She then proceeded to inform us that we could not sit at that table because it was meant for larger groups (despite us not asking to be seated there) and informed us that there were no tables for two available at that moment. She then began to ask if we would mind moving before immediately doing a double take to instruct us to move because, apparently, there was a party waiting for a large table (one that we, again, did not ask to be seated at). \\n\\nBy this time we were both frustrated and irritated with the situation and asked to speak to the manager, we were escorted to the host stand and asked to wait there for the manager to arrive about 5 minutes later. \\n\\nTo the manager's credit, he did listen to us and offered to find us a table quickly but by that point the whole experience had left a sour taste, we opted to leave and told him we just wanted to inform him so it didn't happen to others in the future. \\n\\nThankfully, we hit up Lupe Tortilla instead where we were treated to food that may have been a bit more expensive but was likely much better and, most importantly, we were not asked to relinquish our seats. We then topped it off with a visit to Austin Beerworks...

The girl that served me had to scrape the bottom of each pan to get ingredients.  Needless to say that left me with very little meat that was overcooked and dry.  The guacamole is $2.00 extra and usually I don't mind paying the extra because it is good and there is a generous amount.

I had an amazing experience all around: upon arrival, we walked in through the back entrance from the Krogg Market and were immediately greeted by friendly staff who stopped what they were doing to point us toward the host stand. \\n\\nFrankly one of the highlights of our meal was the salsas. The tortillas chips were nothing special, but the salsa was so incredible they could have brought week-old stale chips and I still would've finished the entire basket. There were 2 salsas: a richer/traditional red salsa and an avocado salsa verde (the star of the show). For our meal, we had the chicken fajitas and 3 tacos; a pork taco, steak taco, and shrimp taco. The fajitas were unreal, easily the best I have ever had in Atlanta. Not only were the portions sizable, but one order came with a delicious pico, half a lime, melted Mexican butter (really thrilled about this stuff...) and free guac. Sorry Chipotle.... The pork and steak tacos were absolutely delicious, in particular the pork taco, and came with grilled onions and a side of guac/pico. If I have one complaint, my steak might have been a bit overcooked and was somewhat tough, but not to the degree of tasting unpleasant. To my pleasant surprise, the tacos were huge... I couldn't finish a whole one after eating the fajitas! The tortillas were my favorite part of the tacos, I'm not a huge fan of the texture of corn tacos so I was a good balance between a well-seasoned and authentic taste with a more smooth (as opposed to the grit of corn) texture. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I didn't try any of the cocktails, but I did see the bar staff juicing really fresh looking AND smelling grapefruits and limes, which I will take as a good sign!\\n\\nThe atmosphere was gorgeous, seats were comfortable (even outside where we sat) and staff was dressed perfectly for the vibe of Superica.

The box was like a prized treasure! After having sampled a variety of things from their menu, we've come to the conclusion that we just don't understand cannolis because we didn't actually love Mike's Pastry. In fact, we thought Mike's was just okay and average at best. We waited 45 minutes for their pastries and it wasn't worth the wait. They're very expensive also so I wouldn't come by often unless you enjoy burning a hole in your wallet. \\n\\nTheir best sellers are their cannolis and they have a ton of flavors. We settled on their classic ricotta cannoli and their chocolate chip cannoli. I preferred their chocolate chip flavor because it helped cut through some of that richness in the ricotta. It's hard to explain but Mike's cannolis are just too big. They taste better when they're smaller because the cream to pastry shell ratio is a little more even. I think their size hurts them. We also ordered a carrot cake cupcake, a lobster tail and some anise biscotti. My favorite thing from Mike's is definitely their lobster tail but DO NOT order if you do not have a group of 4. It's HUGE but quite delicious. If you have to order one thing from Mike's, I recommend the lobster tail. My husband really liked the carrot cake cupcake but I found it overwhelmingly sweet. It was drowning in frosting. As far as biscotti goes, their wasn't anything special. It was fine. \\n\\nI don't understand why Mike's is so popular. I understand that they are an old family run bakeshop but their pastries aren't anything out of the ordinary. Not to mention, they are cash only which is one of my main pet peeves. There's zero seating inside also so everything is to-go only. A good thing about them is that their lines are organized enough so that it isn't absolute chaos inside their store. I would say that you should at least go once to say that you've been there but I would never go out of my way to go to Mike's. 3/5"},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Great variety in the menu.

My girl and her sister and friend were in the bathroom. A security employee approached me and told me I had to get moving.

I was the only white guy in the club that we noticed. I continued to tell him I was just waiting for my wife. He did not care. I waited around outside of the place and continued to try and talk to a manager. He finally came to talk to me. To my surprise he did not care about what had happened and continued to defend his security employees regardless of how many people we had telling him what had happen. He basically walked away in mid sentence with no remorse. Avoid this place at all cost. I'm not saying the mistreatment was done because of my race but I do now question the securities motives. They also were very confrontational when I insisted in talking to a manger. They had 6-7 bouncers around me all threatening me.

Now, folks ain't lying about the service. They're kinda slow and disorganized. There may be a few mixups here and there,  but I get the sense that it has far more to do with the staff trying to find their rhythm rather than poor attitudes,  ineptitude,  etc. I would be surprised if they were still having service issues a few months from now.   They didn't seem any more chaotic than any other restaurant that's only been open for 2 weeks or so.  Besides, they all seem really positive and eager. They're trying and it shows, so I can respect that. Moral of the story, enter with a spirit of patience.  And it's DEFINITELY worth entering.  Why, you ask?\\n\\nBecause the food is SOOOO worth it.  \\n\\nI ordered the 3-piece dark (don't judge me) with mac n' cheese and greens. My friend had the 2-piece white.  Having never been to a Gus', I didn't realize their chicken is \\"hot and spicy.\\" Now, I'm a fan of spicy foods, but those who are not should take note. I didn't think it was crazy hot. It's not a sauce or anything,  just spicy seasoning added to their batter (which btw, was an interesting texture...not sure how to describe it - but it's good!). If you can tolerate the spiciness of Popeye's chicken or Chick-fil-A's spicy chicken (which is still a bit spicier than Gus' chicken), you'll be fine. I also loved that it gave you all the feels of comfort eating Southern food, but minus the grease. When I was finished eating,  I was full but I didn't feel heavy,  like I needed a nap. I ditched the sides that came with it (baked beans and cole slaw) and paid the $.50 extra for my preferred sides - in this case,  mac n' cheese and greens. \\n\\nSon.  \\n\\nThis was HANDS DOWN the best greens and mac n' cheese I've ever eaten in a restaurant.  Like,  it legit tasted like something your mama n' dem may have cooked. My friend had the baked beans and cole slaw, and while she loved the cole slaw, she thought the beans were basic. \\n\\nBecause it's nearly impossible for me to visit a restaurant for the first time and not try a dessert,  I ordered the chocolate chess pie to take with me.  I didn't know what the hell chess pie was, though a patron (saint of Nom) described it as a sweet custard filling nestled between a thin layer of sugar, on a pie crust.  Not sure about the layer of sugar, but that sounds about right.  Let me warn you,  it's not a pretty slice of pie, but it's delicious.  Somehow it managed to remind me of a brownie pie - flavor-wise.  \\n\\nDrinks came in a cute little branded plastic cup that you can take with you - a nice touch for first-timers.\\n\\nThey have fried okra, pickle spears and green tomatoes for appetizer options. I heard the fried green tomatoes were delicious. I ordered them but they never made it out. Im hoping to try them on the next visit. \\n\\nLast note, since its summer and people may be wearing sleeveless tops, shorts, etc., and for those who are cold-natured, consider bringing a little wrap or something.  I thought the temperature was normal inside the restaurant, but my friend was apparently freezing the whole time.  So keep a wrap or cardigan handy,  ladies (eh, and gents opting-in on that romper life this summer).\\n\\nBut yeah, low-key, this might have been one of the best comprehensive meals I've had in a minute.

From \\"Fix it Felix\\" and \\"Pac-Man\\", to \\"Galaga\\" and \\"Tapper\\", they've got all of the solid classic games. There is a room with several pin ball machines and they also have a lot of the newest gaming systems if you don't happen to be feeling nostalgic. I personally enjoy the pin ball games, so I spent much of my time on those. There are also tables with board games. When it comes to gaming, this place really does have it going on. Something else that I noticed is that all of the games work perfectly. Every little light, every button, every joystick and even the gaming artwork were all in great condition and working well. You can certainly tell that the owner takes pride in what they have going on. You can reserve a table for a party, order food from their menu and they also offer gaming wristbands for an hour or unlimited time. All of the games are free play, so you simply press start and away you go! I could honestly play here for hours. With my son's birthday just around the corner, I think he's already eyeing this place for his party. I wouldn't talk him out of it.

Driving there i kept missing the parking lot (my fault for not listening to GPS) I must have circled the block like 3 times acknowledging that the truck was parked n the parking lot at a local bar like a dummy. I finally parked behind the actual parking lot and walked up. Luckily, there wasn't a long line at 6pm and the line moved swiftly.\\n\\nI noticed that once you've ordered your meal they wait until they complete your order before taking the next person in line (probably due to them having one window instead of a order and pick up window) regardless of this the wait was really short in between orders.\\n\\nFood review:\\n\\nI ordered the 3 st louis style ribs with spicy dry rub, 1lb of beef brisket and a small baked beans. \\n\\nThe spicy dry rub on the ribs tasted amazing! Packed full of flavor with a small hint of heat it was a dry rub that was really well done however, the ribs wasn't fall of the bone as I liked and could of been smoked a little longer actually, i cant tell if it started as a smoked rib or cooked first, the bark didn't seem too apparent and he meat didnt shrink to exposet he ends of the rib bones like good smoked ribs do.\\n\\nThe brisket though, the brisket was smoked perfectly was a sexy bark that was really flavorful and leaving a really flavorful and tender piece of meat. Bite after bite I just couldn't get enough of the brisket it was definitely the highlight and deserved a 4 star on it's own. The bark had the perfect smokey flavor with a great texture when you bite into it with the meat meat being smoked so well it kind of just melts in your mouth, no sauce needed.\\n\\nI did regret getting the baked beans. Upon opening it, it looked really legit with pieces of pork in there and good coloring, until i took my first bite into it. This side dish is so.... sweet i just couldn't take anymore bites after the second one. The sweetness overpowered everything that could have made this side dish really good.\\n\\nEnd of food review.\\n\\nThe staff were friendly and the guy who gave me my order even double checked to make sure I got everything I ordered without me asking. The spicy dry rub was perfect in flavor and a nice kick although the ribs could have been smoked longer. The thing to get in my opinion is the brisket and could be one of the best one i've had. Avoid the baked beans as I should have followed everyone else and got the coleslaw (these two were the only available items at the time I went; I waned to get the collard greens but no avail.). \\n\\nThe concept is really cool that you have a truck and outside displays 2 smokers and 2 grills to cook the chicken.

The only downside is that it's quite far from Magic Kingdom and the other parks and there are no direct shuttles between Magic Kingdom and Downtown Disney.  We had to take the monorail to the nearest hotel (the Contemporary) to catch the shuttle to Downtown Disney and it took an extra 30 minutes for us to get there.

If Boston were to have a Travel Channel Food War between Mike's and Modern, I know my allegiance is now sworn to Mike's. \\n\\nTonight we headed to the North End for dinner and since I was already starving, why not just get a cannoli before dinner? So we headed to Mike's and muscled our way in through the 7:00 crowd, bringing our prize (ricotta filling only, no chocolate, and this time with pistachios for a change) back outside. As we were walking to find a good restaurant, we took that thing down. It was as it always was - creamy, tangy, just the right amount of sweet, and crispy. I can't stop raving about it when I'm eating it and my thoughts are drawn to someday swimming in a big vat of that luscious ricotta filling. OMFG. No joke. I've always thought if I were to do one crazy thing in life, it would be to swim in a pool of M&Ms like Scrooge McDuck and his gold coins. I think that has changed now to Mike's ricotta filling. Oh god, it's sOOOooooOOOOooooOOOOooooo GOOOOOOOOOOD.\\n\\nAfter dinner, since we had shared a cannoli, we totally deserved another b/c half a cannoli per person would have been preposterous. So since the line out Mike's was RIDICULOUS, we decided, what better time to start the smackdown than now? Well the line was much shorter at Modern's, and it has a cute, old world charm and cozy feel. I was feeling optimistic. After hearing about the filling-upon-purchase of the shells, how could it not be good? Well after getting the plain shell, ricotta filling, ends dipped in almonds cannoli, we headed outside to try the thing. Smaller than Mike's, a quarter more, but no big deal. Bit into it and . . . . NOTHING. I felt nothing! No whoosh \\"OMFG I LOVE cannolis and I can't believe I thought I never liked them!\\". It was quite the disappointment, and I chomped down again, trying to figure out what magical thing was missing. The boyfriend initially thought it was pretty much the same, but by the time it was gone, we knew it just wasn't as good as Mike's.\\n\\nHere's my analysis: During dinner I had mentioned how I thought that Mike's put something extra in their ricotta filling - cream cheese perhaps? There's something just very very slightly and delightfully tangy that reminds me of the cream cheese frosting I made this past weekend that really hooks me. And its cold, which Modern's wasn't, which made me wonder if theirs is chilled properly. The shell also just tastes a bit more rich at Mike's somehow. Or perhaps Mike just laces their filling with crack. That doesn't bother me - what does bother me is that I don't know what it is!! I neeeeed it. \\n\\nEnding the night with Modern's cannoli actually made me a little miserable. Normally my stops to the North End finish with Mike's cannolis and I am on cloud 9, envisioning my pool of ricotta filling and how I am going to infiltrate the shop to figure out what the filling is made of. Instead, I ended it with a lackluster cannoli that made me think \\"Huh, that kinda sucked.\\" ARGH! I woulda gone back to Mike's to get another cannoli just so I could rectify my mistake, but I was too full by that time.\\n\\nConclusion: between Modern and Mike's, Mike's wins the cannoli challenge hands down. I always thought I wasn't getting the whole cannoli experience because Mike's might be the more touristy, less authentic spot, but no, their cannoli's are OMFG amazing and I really want another one right now."},{"name":"Yaletown Brewing Company","address":"1111 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Truly bizarre experience.

But, for all the Chinese residents there, Felico's might be their few exposures to Greek cuisine.  Their clientele was all Chinese.  During my last visit, they actually had a tour bus pull up and about 40 Chinese tourists disembarked to enjoy a pre-ordered \\"Greek feast\\".\\n\\nThe menu is quite expansive with both surf and turf options.  Prices are approximately 15-25% more expensive than typical, but probably indicative of the types of customers.  Service was very good; our waiter was attentive and quite conversational.  But, that might have been because we one of the few customers who could actually speak English.  Food took a while to arrive, but our entire table's food all arrived at the same time rather in staggered measures.  Water was refilled several times.\\n\\nThe Mediterranean Salmon was noteworthy for its flavour and presentation.  The steak I ordered, on the other hand, looked a bit lost on its plate as the serving size was a bit small.  But, the steak was otherwise cooked the way I liked it, and it was flavourful if a bit on the small side.  The roast lamb, interestingly, was served boneless in a bowl rather than as a large chunk of roasted flesh like typical Greek restaurants.  This made the serving size appear small, but I am assuming there was just as much edible meat.\\n\\nThe Lamb Souvlaki was served far too rare; bloody and very chewy.  It was sent back for additional attention and returned properly cooked.\\n\\nIn a vacuum, Felicos is a decent Greek restaurant.  But, compared to the ones in a world-class city like Vancouver, Richmond is definitely under-served."},{"name":"Karma - Concord","address":"105 Thoreau St","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"I Was very disappointed in my takeout order.

There's not a ton of good Korean food in PDX, and when Koreana was sold to the new owners, the only even decent Korean place I knew of went down the shitter.  \\n\\nFinally, thanks to Yelp, I have found some halfway decent Kimchi Chigae in the PDX area. This place has a better (and more authentic) selection of Korean soups and other favorites than any other place I've been to around here.  They serve soft tofu soup, Kimchi Chigae, and a few other soups and stews (but alas, no Kong  Biji Jigae).  They also have bi bim bap, some fish dishes, some chap chae, and other noodle things.  They offer some bbq (bulgogi, kalbi) but no table-top bbq.  \\n\\nThe lunch prices are reasonable ($6.95), and they accompany the soup with the usual selection of pickled Korean sides:  Kimchi, pickled cucumber, pickled bean sprout, pickled mushrooms, and squid jerky (with some sweet sticky sauce).  They offer a bento for the same price, with choice of chicken, beef, or pork bulgogi, salad, gyoza, tofu, and rice. \\n\\nI was not super impressed with the stew, but it was good enough to bring me back. Its way better than what Koreana has become, and better than any other place I have found in PDX.  My dining partner said that the chicken bulgogi bento was tasty, and he's a pretty anal and picky person, so it can't be all that bad. \\n\\nThey offer soju on the drink list, so I fear that I will end up here for some dinner at some point in my life. Nothing quite like drinking soju and eating some good  (hopefully good - I have not tried it yet) Korean bbq.  \\n\\nThe workers (owners? - looked like it) were really nice. A bit light on the service, but otherwise very friendly.  I saw quite a few Koreans dining there, which was a good sign.  I always balk when an Asian food place is full of white people. There was no balking here.\\n\\nI am excited to try some more dishes here, even though the Kimchi Stew was not super amazing.

They recommended some items which were great, it was served promptly. Everything about that was great. The reason for the 3 stars, is the drinks. If I'm going to pay that much for a martini, I want a martini. The glasses are not very big and they will only 3/4 full. And I'm really trying to struggle to find what alcohol was actually in the glass.  If ordering a pear martini I want vodka in it. Not a watered down drink.  And you should be able to taste that. They should really visit some other bars in the area and see what their drinks are like. When you're competing with places like Sabotinos, Artichokes, cafe italia, public kitchen, you really need to step up your game with the drinks.

The fabulous view is the only thing that keeps us coming back and it is nice to have a full lake to look at. \\n\\nWife ordered chicken lettuce wraps and got some strange combination of chopped dry chicken and mini lettuce leaves that were hardly large enough to fold over much less hold any meat. Don't mistake these for anything you've ordered at an Asian restaurant. \\n\\nFor the second time in as many outings I ordered fajitas as they frequently do a decent job and they taste pretty good. For some odd reason the last two times I've ordered them the only vegetable on the hot skillet was onions, not a bell pepper in sight. I tried shrimp for the first time and they were pretty bland so I would stay with either chicken or beef and save the extra money. \\n\\nMy son enjoyed his fried chicken sandwich and fries.

I remembered walking in briefly during another Orlando vacation a few years back and had been wanting to try it out since. As a chocolate lover and fan of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the concept of this factory-type restaurant/chocolate shop intrigued.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, this place doesn't seat you right away and doesn't take reservations, so bare that in mind during your visit (it makes sense being in the heart of the busy City Walk). That noted, the wait time isn't normally more than fifteen-twenty minutes unless you come on a busy Saturday night, which it tends to run up to an hour. I came three nights in a row.\\n\\nWhat I tried:\\n\\nIt May Contain Nuts: Peanut Butter ice cream, peanut butter pie, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Reese's Pieces, peanut brittle, peanut butter sauce topped with chopped peanuts and whipped cream. This is dessert is extremely indulgent and only recommended for true peanut butter lovers. The peanut butter ice cream is creamy, peanut buttery and right up there with other artisan peanut butter variations I've tried; the best part of the whole dessert is the peanut butter pie, which reminded me a lot of a peanut butter mouse tart from my favorite cafe back in LA. I enjoyed this dessert the first time, even the second time, even the third time, unfortunately, it does have its flaws. For one, the peanut butter cups tasted stale every time I ordered it. Secondly, the peanut brittle was unpalatably hard. Overall, a 3.5/5.\\n\\nThe Strawberry Shortcake: After trying the It May Contain Nuts two nights in a row, I wanted to venture out and give some of the other menu desserts a go. This specific sundae consists of peanut butter-strawberry ice cream, chocolate covered strawberries, a white-chocolate almond bark, an entire slice of NY cheesecake, it's drizzled with strawberry sauce and topped with whipped cream. The peanut butter-strawberry was superb; the cheesecake was creamy and tasty, but nothing set it apart from other cheesecakes I've had. Its biggest setback is the chocolate covered strawberries and white-chocolate almond bark; the strawberries were tart, the chocolate tased subpar, which for an establishment that specializes in chocolate desserts, was a major shock; the white-chocolate almond bark tasted, for lack of better words, almost tasteless. Overall, a 2.75/5.\\n\\nThe Birthday Cake Sundae: What blew me away about this particular sundae was its presentation; a vanilla ice cream cone, whole slice of Funfetti cake, sprinkles, and whipped cream. My friend ordered it and let me try a bite, so I went for a spoonful of the cake and ice cream; the cake was dry but the vanilla cream was pretty tasty. Overall, a 2.75 for presentation and as aforementioned, solid vanilla ice cream.\\n\\nToothsome Chocolate Emporium gets four stars based on the establishment's design (love it, love, love it), the warm service staff, and the \\"It May Contain Nuts,\\" which would make for a nearly excellent dessert if the Reeses's Peanut Butter Cups we're rotated more frequently in the prep station. I'll be back to try more of the desserts and even have an actual meal given its various entree and sandwich options."},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"8440 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2","text":"This location always has a line around the building for the drive through.

The interior can be described as Buddha meets Broomfield.  Hardwood floors and rock-encrusted walls peppered with Tibetan and Buddhist symbols thoughout.  Prayer wheels, masks, scrolls and a tranquil waterfall feature all working together to create a, dare I say it, \\"zen-like\\" atmosphere.\\n\\nAfter being seated and ordering a \\"Good Karma\\" beer (hey, what can I say, I need all the help I can get), we were brought a basket of papadam with four dipping sauces (including mint chutney, cucumber raita, mango chutney and a fourth I couldn't identify).  We ordered an appetizer of saag dig (creamed spinach) with naan (flatbread cooked in the tandoori oven).  Now, I'm not normally a big fan of cooked spinach, but oh_my_Dalai_Lama, this was the best spinach I've ever had.  Mild, smooth, and totally delicious.  And the portion was HUGE!  We ate like a couple of ravenous yaks, and still had plenty to bring home.  The naan was also cooked perfectly, with a flawless match of both crunchy and chewy.\\n\\nSince I'd never had Tibetan food before, I skipped the more Indian-centric offerings and went for a Momo platter which included 8 dumplings (I chose a mix of veggie and beef), a cup of dahl soup, and a side salad.  The salad, while beautifully presented, was totally forgettable.  The dahl, on the other hand, was also an image of perfection.  Hot, smooth, and exquisitely spiced.  The dumplings were great.  The veggie dumplings were similar to a Chinese dumpling, with cabbage, carrot and whatnot inside.  Good, but not amazing.  The beef dumplings, however, were out of this world.  Delicate, yet hearty, with a wonderful flavor profile.\\n\\nMy wife got the tikka masala with lamb.  It too was delicious, but I think the lamb might have been too strong of a flavor to go with the rich, creamy sauce.  All in all, the meal was fantastic, and it's obvious that the chef executes an uncommon skill to the food that he puts out.\\n\\nWe'll definitely be back, and I encourage others to make the trek to Tibet's.

I was hungry and excited!\\nSeveral minutes pass by, and the server brings my friend's drink, and places another in front of the acquaintance we were with. Nothing for me, and still no water. In the afternoon. In Texas. \\nAfter a few minutes we figure out the drink she placed in front of my acquaintance was mine, despite the fact she never acknowledged me, let alone put it in front of...me. When she passed by again I asked for the water. No apology or acknowledgement she hadn't brought it. \\nAs she brings the water, she says the grills are down. They might be back up, but it doesn't look hopeful. She returns a few minutes later to confirm they aren't working. For the 4th time this week! But we are welcome to stay and finish our drinks. Which would be fine if we hadn't all ordered and were expecting to eat dinner. \\nAnd that was pretty much that. My cocktail was mostly ice. Our server was inattentive and unapologetic. Nothing was comped or offered in lieu of the fact that we all ordered burgers and waited 10 minutes to be told they weren't going to come. I'm giving 1 star for ease of parking and 1 for the fries, which a friend ordered and were tasty. \\nOverall a disappointing experience and not one I'm likely to repeat or recommend to friends and family visiting when there are so many other options in Austin."},{"name":"Muzzarella Pizza & Italian Kitchen","address":"7780 Lake Underhill Rd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Arrived around 20 minutes before close, server was very rude, presumably for this reason, but we were very quick to order and be ready to leave since I am a server and I also dislike when people arrive directly before close, but I never treat guests with contempt.

I've got to try it someday. But you never go inside.  You just drive past it day after day, maybe even for years. I was in that boat with this restaurant but today, today I decided to go inside. \\n\\nFirst off let me say that the staff was polite, courteous and very professional.  I ordered the oxtails, with mac & cheese and collards. The food was... atrocious and that's being kind. I don't know if they cook their oxtails in a pressure cooker or not not but they should. The meat was so tough I though I was chewing bubblegum. The flavor wasn't too bad. It was by no means seasoned perfectly but I could live with the mediocre flavor. \\n\\nI love mac & cheese, almost everyone I know does. It's crunchy, it's cheesy, it's gooey, it's perfection... when it's made right. I don't know if I can say this on Yelp but this mac & cheese was total shit!  Who ever made this mac & cheese gave 0 fucks. When I tasted it, I felt like they were mad at me. It was almost like when Octavia Spencer brought that chocolate pie over to the people's house in \\"The Help\\". When you bite into this mac & cheese, just know that somewhere inside that restaurant someone is telling you, \\"Eat my shit\\". \\n\\nNow for the collards, point blank they were seasoned poorly and slightly undercooked. I think that for me one of the most offensive things about the collards was the fact that they felt it so necessary to add enormous chunks of stem in with my meal. Because the stems were so plentiful in my greens I will not accuse them of being canned, so there's that. I will however go ahead and say, they probably weren't fresh either.\\n\\nI gave this place one star because I couldn't give it any less. Do yourself a favor: SAVE YOUR MONEY. Don't eat here.

The shells were a bit more bready/buttery in flavor and texture than a typical east coast cannoli. The ricotta was extremely cheesy. Probably the most savory cheese filling i've had in a cannoli- not bad at all per sey, but I prefer a bit more sweetness. The pumpkin spice cannoli was a hard pass- very overwhelming synthetic and almost almond extract taste. The pistachio and normal were heavily dunked in the respective toppings. \\n\\nThe lobster tail was also non traditional. It was instead made with cream puff thick hearty bready dough, rather than the flaky light crispy puff pastry i'm used to. This thing was seriously enormous though. I ended up just eating the inside and leaving the shell. The cream was more of a chantilly light cream but felt like it had been made only minutes ago. \\n\\nI also ordered a \\"neapolitan\\" thinking it was a neopolean (same top and layers in appearance) this was somewhat disappointing. the layers were very very thick, again not flaky phyllo/puff pastry but more of a hard porous bready cracker. The custard was not sweet at all. \\n\\nI also got my first paragina. this thing was just not for me. the top and layers almost were like a rye cracker and bubblegum flavored filling. maybe this is standard but per google it appears it is normally a bit different. \\n\\nall in all definitely stop by for something, whether it'll be the absolute best pastry of all time is debatable and depending on your personal tastes."},{"name":"Okiboru Tsukemen & Ramen","address":"6125 Roswell Rd, Ste 800","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Good Fundamentals and Potential; A Number of Kinks to Work Out ||\\n\\nOkiboru bills itself as the only Michelin-rated (Bib Gourmand, not the more well-known stars) ramen shop in LA as well as the only Michelin-rated tsukemen in the world,** so it's all in on the tsukemen dipping-noodle style that is well-entrenched in Japan but still has some ways to go in the US.  They've just set up an outpost in Atlanta, and a friend and I visited a few days after their initial soft opening.  What we could discern was that Okiboru has the fundamentals to be an excellent tsukemen-ramen shop, though there there are a number of teething kinks to work out.\\n\\nI chose the Buta Paitan Gyokai (pork bone and seafood broth, usually referred to as tonkotsu-gyokai) as it's the stnadard tsukemen style, where the broth is thick enough to stick to the noodles as you dip them.  I was happy that the broth was rich and concentrated as it should be, with plenty of porky flavor and smoky/sour notes from the seafood.  However, it was very salty; its ratios definitely need to be tweaked.  It also came out fairly lukewarm even for tsukemen broth, which I will chalk up to opening-week issues.\\n\\nThe noodles themselves were made in-house and were nice and thick as they should be, unlike many shops who just re-use thinner ramen noodles in their tsukemen.  However, I thought my noodles were a little limp, probably from being overcooked but maybe also needing more kansui alkali water in the recipe for that additional bite and snap. \\n\\nOkiboru uses pork belly for their chashu.  That's fine, but the cuts were very fatty and were waxy in taste.  With such a rich tonkotsu-gyokai broth, perhaps torching the pork belly with an Iwatani torch would've introduced a more desirable charred texture to the chashu while cutting a bit of fat.  In addition, my friend got three slices while I only got two--some consistency here in the future is necessary for preventing tussles over chashu and broken friendships.\\n\\nThe rest of the bowl had a few more hit-and-misses.  The ajitama egg was quite runny, which I don't mind but really should be more jelly-like in its consistency.  The bowl also came with a lime wedge: you are supposed to squeeze it over the noodles halfway through to open up some new flavors.  Yet I would recommend against doing so, at least for this tonkotsu-gyokai: there are plenty of sour notes in the broth from the seafood, so the lime juice creates a lot of gustatory dissonance.  \\n\\nThere's also an extensive appetizer menu.  The ebi (shrimp) karaage were unsurprisingly delicious, but the inclusion of pickles as a palate cleanser after each bite was a very nice touch.  The chashu wraps--a slice of chashu, a bit of tartar, perched on top of a slice of daikon, and with a slice of habanero pepper on top--was very nice.  I'm not usually a huge fan of daikon, but this was a very nice package, and I'd rather eat this instead of Momofuku-imitative bao buns any day.\\n\\nOverall Verdict and Caveats: The shop owner Naoki was kind enough to chat with me and my friend about our dining experience and patiently listened to my comments about their noodles and broth.  He expressed the caveat (which I understand and recognize) that they just opened a few days ago and are still in the streamlining their recipes and kitchen ops.  I'm sympathetic to the their initial set-up challenges: my opinion is that judging from their methods of preparation, Okiboru fundamentally knows what it's doing and makes tsukemen in a style similar to what I would expect in Japan; it is not just another generic American Ippudo/Ichiran knock-off.  It has a lot of potential, but for now there are a lot of kinks to work out.  I hope (and am confident) that a later visit will see a lot of these issues excised.\\n\\n**This is also where I must mention that Okiboru needs to change some of its self-promotional material.  While it is indeed \\"The Only Michelin-Rated Ramen Restaurant in LA,\\" it is NOT \\"The Only Michelin-Rated TSUKEMEN Restaurant in the World.\\" As the tsukemen style has taken off in Tokyo for well over two decades, a majority of ramen shops feature it on their menus: of the first 10 of the 22 Michelin-recognized ramen shops in Tokyo, 6 have tsukemen on their menus.  As such, Okiboru's claim that is is the only Michelin-recognized tsukemen shop in the world is untrue, and frankly unnecessary given the impressive LA recognition.  I strongly urge them to take the latter claim down from their website."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great places for a the family.

We also had an order of the truffle fries but it came in a regular side order size even though it's listed as an app for $7.50? The shrimp and lump crab pasta wasn't amazing but still good. I had the forest mushroom flatbread, my only complaint is how dry and plain the bread itself was. It was like they just took the bread and sprinkled some mushrooms, goat cheese crumbles and an excessive amount of arugula. The patty melt was massive! But delicious. As for dessert we were pretty stuffed so we shared a brownie jar milkshake, if you're a chocolate lover like myself do yourself the favor and try it. Overall service was good, Justin the manager walked over a couple times to check on us. I just suggest you do something for birthday's just to add that special touch. They wouldn't even sing happy birthday which was a bummer."},{"name":"Huong Vietnamese Restaurant","address":"1270 Morse Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Been here a few times. They cook some foods authentically, and some that had cut corners. But, what they do best is there com suon (rice platter with porkchop), and there pho. The pork chop is marinated very well, and grilled on charcoal, giving that authentic flavor. My dad who is of Vietnamese descent is really picky when it comes to food and he gave his approval of the dish. The pho is super rich with flavor and you can tell that they cooked the bones for hours making that pho super rich in flavor. We had got some other specially made things which Huong's has occasionally. Some were a miss, but theres never a problem with trying it! There banh beo is also very good, and there nuoc mam is on point! You judge a Vietnamese place by there nuoc mam, and Huongs got it right! There banh mi is huge! But, the taste isn't really quite there. It is a good fix though, if your wanting banh mi. Just don't expect it to be the the traditional banh mi. The bread they have is a bit heavier and banh mi bread traditionally is crispy, airy, and light. There isn't enough pate and buttery mayo. Overall, this is the place I usually go to for Vietnamese food."},{"name":"Crawfish Shack & Oyster Bar","address":"2013 Wells Branch Pkwy, Ste 106","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I love little hole in the wall kind of places.

Small ad cozy, so reservations are recommended, even for 2. They have a small but good beer selection. I had the Four Winds Pale Ale from Delta, BC. If you're going for something non-alcoholi, try their Sparkmouth ginger-ale. Most flavourful ginger-ale I've ever had, w/out being overly gingery, like ginger beer - which I don't like. Food-wise, my husband had the Brisket sandwich (on a Portuguese bun) along with the regular sides of navy beans, cole slaw and Kennebec fries. Heard no complaints. Unfortunately, I didn't think to take a photo of his food, but I did for my meal. I had the 1/2 rack of pork ribs. I don't like navy beans, and am picky about cole slaw. I didn't want anymore fries, because I can never eat all of them. These are somewhat smaller portions than the 1/2 of a plate you get most places. Very manageable. The cole slaw really surprised me and I ate every bit of it and really, could have eaten more. Instead of the navy beans I got cornbread. But I figured I'd be giving that to my husband, cuz I'm not big on cornbread either. This was delicious and the only reason he got a piece was because I was full. The ribs were enormous. Usually, there's more bone than meat on a 1/2 rack of ribs. Not so here. They make their own bbq sauce, and even their own ketchup! Staff are very friendly and the service is quick. We were in and out of there  w/in about 45 min. to an hour. We didn't have dessert, as we were going to a movie (gotta save the calories for M&Ms). I would highly recommend this place. If you go via transit, it's just a few steps from a bus stop.

Service was a tiny bit slow in the beginning (prob exacerbated by the fact that I was hangry) but then they checked up on us just enough for the rest of the meal. The sauces that come with the meal are also really good.\\n\\nAnother positive - yelp says they close at 10:30 so after dinner we sat around for a bit talking and took our time getting the check, getting ready to leave ~10:25. Even though we couldn't see any other people eating, I figured it was just because people eat earlier in Texas / it was slow on a Sunday night. When the waiter came to collect our check, I asked him what time they closed and he said 10. Not once did we feel rushed and they didn't bring us the check before we asked.

However, when we went inside, we were very happy we hadn't given up on our quest to find this magical zen oasis from the busy Cambridge street outside.\\n\\nThe interior itself is nothing to write home about - it's actually kind of dark inside, and the seating situation is sort of weird. There are cushioned benches to sit on, and small tables, which make for a less than comfortable experience if you're trying to chat with someone over one of their delicious drinks. However, the drinks themselves are the real standout, and even though we only went once, I am excited to go back again to try more of the unique creations on the extensive, mixology inspired menu. I got the Black Widow, a creamy strawberry black tea concoction that was as tasty as it was complex, and my boyfriend got the Holy Grail, the lavender sea salt coffee, which he did not like as much, unfortunately. Perhaps lavender and coffee were never meant to be together. Oh well. There are tons of other options for next time! They maintain a great social media presence, and are always doing popups around Cambridge and Boston, so give them a follow and keep an eye out for these unique events - there was a fabulous one during the summer where they made elevated versions of Sno-Cones with tea and fresh fruit.

Back Bay is home to many colleges. Last week was move in week around town. \\n\\nThe secondary problem is that the hotels do not offer complimentary parking for their guests so if you are traveling on a budget, it is very challenging to find a space. During college move in/out if you bring more than one car, as we did, then your parking challenges are doubled. The Marriott Copley place charges their guests $54/ night to park one car. Their excuse is that they do not own the garage. The garage is privately owned and operated. Since guest are already paying astronomical prices to stay in their hotel, Marriott should have an arrangement for their guests to park at a discounted rate. This parking expense is a problem at all the major chains in the area.\\n\\nI'm giving this hotel 3 stars because we experienced some good qualities and some horrendous qualities. First the good. The hotel is clean. The restaurant on site, Champions, is good. Reasonable prices and good food. Friendly staff at Champions. The hotel has a very efficient automated elevator system. In all my travels, it is the only one I've seen like this and it is very good. Gets you to your floor very quickly with no wasted time stopping at multiple floors. Location is ideal. Right across from the prudential Center and a short walk all around BackBay.\\n\\nNow the bad. All double rooms only have double beds. Queens and kings are only in rooms with one bed. So if you are traveling with more than 2 people, be prepared to squeeze into a tiny double bed. This may not be an issue for some people, but if you are used to sleeping in a queen or king at home, sleeping in a double with another person can be challenging. Another negative is the parking which I mentioned earlier. \\n\\nThe main negative experience was with the front desk. We arrived after 11pm after being on the road for 11 hours. We were greeted with nothing but attitude and negativity. Not what you would expect from a reputable chain, especially given that a guest is checking in after 11 and obviously has had a long day. The man who checked us in should not be working the front desk or any customer service job. Terrible customer service and obviously no training on how to interact with people or deal with anything. \\n\\nFortunately I was able to report him the next morning to the manager on duty. I hope this employee gets reprimanded, taken off front desk, and gets the training required for this type of job. The manager on duty was very nice, well trained, and accommodating. To make amends, he gave us complimentary wifi. A nice touch to say he was sorry for the way we were treated the night before. \\n\\nTo summarize, all Boston hotels are pretty pricey. Be warned. Parking is very challenging unless you are prepared to pay a lot. This Marriott is fine other than their personnel issues. We have stayed here before but I don't know that we would stay here again. It will depend on availability of other hotels in the area. Prices are pretty comparable between all the major chains."},{"name":"The Diamond","address":"6 Powell Street, 2nd Floor","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We wanted to hang out in Gastown for the night!

In our opinion this restaurant has to be the best in its class. They serve diner standards however the preparation and results are unparalleled in any diner we have ever eaten at. The prices are affordable and the portions are very generous. It is not the intention of this owner to just serve generous portions as each dish has exquisite taste and is artfully presented.  Anne our waitress gave us warm, sincere and friendly service and checked on us frequently. She made us feel welcome. \\n     The signature omelet although quite large was amazingly light and filled with very nice tasting vegetables that danced on your tongue with an array of flavors you could really taste. Home fries were well cooked and delicately seasoned. Our bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich was literally the best I have ever had. I realize this is strong language however I am sincere in telling you this. Sandwich was a roll up with thin bread and stuffed with fresh lettuce, diced tomatoes and really crisp great tasting bacon with mayonnaise. There is a choice of side orders with the sandwich. Our choice, pasta salad did not disappoint. The pasta salad had bits of ham and various fresh vegetables chopped up in it and tasted great. There is not much more we can add about the food however we will be coming back soon to try some of the other dishes.\\n     The location is convenient and has an ample parking lot that even offers shade in some areas. There are outside tables that seem like they would be pleasant to eat at if you like outdoor dining. The staff seem to be happy which is always nice to see.

The Reese's Pieces we're only sprinkled over whipped cream balls, not ice cream. I was quickly disappointed when my spoon fell right through the whipped cream letting me know you're not getting ice cream with these pieces sucker. It was SO much whip cream. I can't even stress how this $13 Sunday comes with $1 worth of ice cream at $4 worth of whipped cream. They have to be whipping it up in the back and serving more whipped cream then ice cream. After ordering this Sunday this is the point at which I realized in life that whip cream is so much cheaper than ice cream. It was highly disappointed, I didn't expect to learn a life lesson about whipped cream from a $13 Sunday at what's considered a high-end chocolate Emporium.\\n\\nNow the candy store downstairs was full of wonderful looking stuff and I mean wonderful! No prices were posted and I chose a chocolate shot because the glass was made of chocolate and I want it to feel like Willy Wonka and eat my cup after I ate the insides of it. It was a pretty cool experience and concept. However, the one shot was $8.50 if I'd known that beforehand I would not have gotten it. But you know YOLO I probably won't be back again.\\n\\nOverall I felt a little underwhelmed however satisfied but disappointed with the desert. If I wanted to swim in a tub of whipped cream I probably would have gone to Walmart I got $12 of Cool Whip and dumped it in the hot tub and jumped right into it and felt just as silly as eating a plate of whipped cream.\\n\\nOn a side note, it was a little odd that our waitress kept asking us how do we taste. I was unsure if she's trying to get very personal or if this was part of the script.\\n\\nAnd if you order coffee and Order creamer with your coffee be ready to make a mess. The spout on the little coffee creamer picture wasn't big enough to pour the creamer out of the picture it just Pours Down the side of the little picture and out over the table. Including the video just so you can see a very basic function of a very basic item \\"coffee\\" is failing. But on the other side, the coffee is served in a mini French press and it's pretty good coffee!"},{"name":"Menya Ramen","address":"331 W Bridge St","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"We used to live in Japan and love ramen, so this was a must-try!

So many things were wrong and improperly managed that at times it seemed like we were in a sitcom.\\n\\nDay 1: We arrive at midnight after a long day of travel.  We'd paid for a superior room, which will give us a lovely view of the mountains.  We're thrilled to hear that our room has just been remodeled.  However, when we get to the room there is a hole in the ceiling, with water and plaster dripping down on the arm chair.  We're moved to another room.  By the way, both rooms smell like smoke.\\n\\nDay 2: We wake up to discover that the outlet between the beds isn't functioning.  However, when we try to call the front desk to report the problem we discover that they haven't turned our phone on, so we have to go downstairs to report the problem.  They come up to fix the outlet, but then we discover the clock doesn't work and so they return to fix that.\\n\\nWith that settled, when I try to close the sliding door to the bathroom it comes right off the tracks in my hand.  I wedge it back into the slots and make a mental note to ask them to fix it later.\\n\\nWhen we return in the afternoon the TV doesn't work.  They send a person up to check on it, but he disappears never to return.  After about an hour I speak with a person at the front desk who says that he went to check on the main cable connection for the tower, but now they can't find him.  He's not answering his phone.\\n\\nDay 3: Sill no TV.  That's when I discover there's no hot water.  In fact, none of the \\"superior\\" rooms have TV or hot water.  After some wrangling I get temporary access to a dingy low-end room that has hot water just so that I can wash up.\\n\\nIn the afternoon I run into a contractor in the elevator who says they've been working on the roof but can't figure out what the pitch is so they're not sure what direction the water is flowing. That explains the leaks.\\n\\nI go to the ice machine.  It doesn't work.  After some hunting around I find one on another floor that does.\\n\\nDay 4: It's 3:00 and the cleaning staff still hasn't gotten to our room.  I call the front desk.  The phone rings and rings and rings.  When someone finally picks up, they hang up before I get a chance to say anything, so I call back and after many rings they finally answer.  They say that they have until 4:00 to clean rooms, but they'll send someone.\\n\\nI call room service and it goes straight to voice mail.  They say to leave a message and they'll call back. Thirty minutes passes with no return call and so I head down to the front desk.\\n\\nI  talk with Jessica at the front desk.  I say that at this point I am incredibly frustrated, that we stayed in this hotel specifically because it could provide room service.  \\n\\nShe says that we need to be patient because they've run into a string of problems.  I say that I can understand that they have encountered problems, but the fact of the matter is that I have NEVER stayed in a place were so many things don't function, and I've traveled a lot.\\n\\nShe says, \\"but you need to look at this from the perspective of the employees.\\"  Up until then I have tried to keep my cool, but at this point I've had it -- the customers are paying for service that they are not receiving, not the employees!  With each of the earlier conversations I have tried to be empathetic, and the staff has been gracious up until now -- great at diffusing frustration.  This response doesn't cut it.  In a curt tone, she then says, \\"what do you want me to do?\\"  I say, \\"I want to talk to the manager.\\"  She says, \\"I am the manager.\\"  I say, \\"then I want to talk with your boss.\\"  She says \\"he's not in until Sunday\\" (it's Friday).\\n\\nSo I get the information to write a letter of complaint and then head out to the dining room, where I ask if I can order room service and mention that my voice mail message hadn't been returned.  She says, \\"I'm sorry nobody got back to you, I'm the only one here.\\"  I feel for her, but I also think that a hotel that provides room service should have enough people working in the dining room to field calls.\\n\\nBack in the room the food arrives and we settle in to watch our now-functioning TV.  \\n\\nThat's when we see the mouse run across the top of the dresser and onto the floor.  I call downstairs and the custodian comes up with a broom and a box, with the idea that he will scare it from one end of the dresser and I will scoop it up into the box on the other side.  That doesn't work and I ask if he has something like D-Con they could put in the room.  He brings up a mouse trap and tells me to call him if I hear something snap.\\n\\nLong story short.  The $200+/night superior rooms have AMAZING views of the mountains.  Almost everybody on staff is polite and patient.  NOTHING works as it is supposed to.  And Jessica the manager doesn't know how to deal with customer complaints. Can't make this stuff up!!"},{"name":"Gold Garden Restaurant","address":"1818 SE 122nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This spot is one of those hole-in-the-wall places that deserves much more love than it actually receives.

Long story short, we decided to have a good meal inside of Epcot, which isn't that easy to do. We booked our reservations two weeks in advance and got in for a 7pm dinner when the park closed at 9pm on Superbowl Sunday. \\n\\nHere is what we ate: two orders of the crab salad with cucumber, one lobster green salad, one ravioli dish and this was my order: lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach with mushrooms. My parents loved the crab salads, saying it was very fresh seafood and wonderful presentation. Both of the parents had tilefish (something common from the east side. They loved it, but my mom felt the vegetables were too spicy for her. On the other hand, my hubby had the lobster salad with me, which we both loved (mixed greens with watercress, avocado and lobster with a very light dressing) and the vegetarian ravioli. Be forewarned, these are extremely heavy with a rich butternut squash mix inside. I wanted to have something different and ordered three sides. I shared my lobster mac and cheese with my husband, which I think was lighter in broth than his ravioli. Also, it had great chunky lobster pieces. \\n\\nThe creamy spinach and the mushrooms were excellent and not too heavy. Also, the restaurant offers you to try three different types of bread: pretzel baguette, a multigrain and a sourdough. These were excellent, especially with their pink salt butter that has a light maple syrup hint to it. \\n\\nThe bill came to $230, with one order of a house chardonnay and a blueberry ice wine martini.

Beef-filled dumplings didn't pair as well with the slightly spicy Asian broth; the dish would have been much better if these had been shrimp or pork-based dumplings.\\n\\nService was friendly and attentive without feeling rushed.

My friends live literally right across the street. It's also great that they are open late. They have their own small parking lot right out back. The service was also super quick. The food however I have some mixed opinions about...\\n\\nSorry to say, the Dan Dan noodles just weren't for me. It was my first time eating Szechuan peppers and I honestly just didn't like the flavor nor the slightly numbing sensation in my mouth. \\n\\nThe Sherry Drunken Shrimp were gigantic but the downside is you only get three of them with this dish. They are well seasoned but they are served with the heads, shell, tail, and legs. This is also not my cup of tea. When I eat and prepare foods I am meticulous about cleaning them. For example I typically devein my shrimp on both sides whereas most people only do one side. I did eat them anyway and they were good.\\n\\nHonestly I still think I would come back to this place even though I wasn't exactly thrilled with the food because I did like the restaurant itself and the ambiance was nice. The waitress was also very helpful as well because we had a picky eater in our group (it wasn't me I swear). She took the time to explain all of the ingredients in each dish and was very knowledgeable.\\n\\nMy husband enjoyed his soft shell crab po' boy as well.

The sides are pretty large, and with the drink I thought the price was more than reasonable.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the well balanced macaroni, and the coleslaw was more refreshing than the mayo laden kind.  I'm not a sweet tea fan, but I tried it and it wasn't too bad.  It sounds like it's a pretty a good version according to sweet tea lovers.  I wish they had an unsweetened version.  I also had what was easily the best banana pudding of my life.  \\n\\nThe chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The holy temperature had plenty of heat that made me sweat, but I didn't get that pain I look for when trying something that supposedly pushes the limits.  The only reason for my 4 instead of 5 star is that I'm not one for community style eating and I would like to someday try a \\"holier/est(?)\\" heat level.

The food was not only good, and very fresh, but the place was spotlessly clean, not often found in any restaurant anywhere!\\n\\nAlso, the family run and casual atmosphere of this beautifully decorated restaurant was perfect for our family's liking. The food was perfectly balanced with such great tastes that it challenged my taste buds, and after sampling several different dishes, we closed off the evening with wonderful homemade desserts like their flan, carrot cake and great rice pudding washed down with tamarind soda.

The food is fine. Good even. The atmosphere is nice. So if you're just looking for somewhere to sit and drink something and maybe read a book to pass the time, and you are not at all hungry, this might be your place. But if you are wanting to eat within 30 to 40 minutes of placing your order, go somewhere else. I tried heading this off by calling ahead for a pickup order. On the phone she said it would be waiting for me when I got there. We get there 20 minutes later and go to check out. They take our money like they're going to give us food, but then we wait. And wait. And wait more. Finally I ask and it appears they haven't even started cooking it. I get that a kitchen can get backed up, but tell people that ahead of time. Especially phone orders when people are just trying to grab food and get going. But at least tell us when we get there and you take our money. Let us know it's not ready (and not even started!) so we can decide if waiting for it is worth our time/money. Further, the place was by no means packed. So empty tables aren't going to be an indicator of how long you're going to wait for food.  I know there aren't limitless options for restaurants in East Point, but at this rate you could just hop in the car and drive to another part of town and get food before these guys will even put your order on the griddle."},{"name":"Shabusen Yakiniku House","address":"755 Burrard Street, Suite 202","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Crazy fantastic at a more than reasonable price for all you can eat."},{"name":"Dalina","address":"687 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"When they first opened they were awesome!!

Food was good but servers were best part."},{"name":"Nikolai's Roof","address":"255 Courtland St NE, Fl 30","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"True story: I planned on proposing to my girlfriend of five years (now fianc√©) at Nikolai's Roof this past August 1st, and our lackluster experience there caused her to jokingly say halfway through our meal, \\"if you propose to me, I'll say 'yes,' but I won't be happy. I want to leave.\\" I nervously and replied, \\"Oh, psshhh, I wasn't going to. Ha ha ha\\" and then my soul temporarily left my body for a good minute or two. I still feel bad for lying, but I couldn't dare tell her the truth.\\n\\nAnd sadly, I've been putting off writing this review, because 1) writing less than three-star reviews aren't fun; 2) I didn't want to relive this experience, again; and 3) I genuinely wanted to provide constructive criticism. Consumers need to know, though, so here's my take:\\n*****\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nWe visited on a Saturday night for dinner. The menu and staff encourage diners to take part in choosing either three, four, or six courses. I went with three and my lady went with four. (We wanted to split dessert.) No problems ordering. \\n\\nOf all the dishes we ate that night, we really only liked the seared diver scallops. The non-memorable dishes include a rack of lamb with mushrooms on top of polenta, some kind of grilled fish with drizzle, shrimp and (crunch) grits, a raspberry ice cream, and an earl grey tea cr√®me br√ªl√©e. The non-dessert menu items lacked flavor and freshness. The desserts had a bad combination of flavors, especially that creme brulee.\\n\\nI wanted to send a few of the dishes back, but we were way too hungry to do so by the time the food came out.\\n\\nI will say, though, that they definitely know how to beautifully plate food, and I did enjoy the several Moscow Mules I downed. (After all, I was a wreck awaiting to propose to my girlfriend.) \\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nI forget the nice gentleman's name, but he provided honest recommendations and apologized for the slowness of the kitchen. More about it the kitchen, our entire meal lasted 2.5 hours, and it seemed that it took about 20-30 minutes between each course.\\n\\nIII. AMBIENCE/ D√âCOR\\nPerhaps the saddest part about our experience was that the main dining area (which is to the right once you step out of the elevator) overlooks a part of Downtown that  is... undesirable. Fellas or ladies, if you plan on taking a loved one out for a romantic night, know that the combination of bustling Highway 85, the gigantic Coke sign, and the infamous Grady Hospital does not work. More about Grady, we watched helicopters e-vac accident victims back and forth every ten minutes or so. Ironically, my lady works at Grady, and she was not amused at the view\\n\\nThe reason I mention this is because Nikolai's Roof has an entire floor, and only half of it is used. The roomy non-dining area of the restaurant overlooks not only a part of Downtown, but also Midtown, and then Buckhead. Plus, having a half empty restaurant really kills the vibe. I mean, get a DJ, a piano player, a fortune teller, an old woman knitting, turn it into a hookah lounge, have it as a space where people shoot heroin. I don't care. Anything! Just don't have stacked chairs in a room of sadness there. Like, do y'all even care? \\n\\nSpeaking of the space, their interior needs a facelift. The hues of light pinks and lime greens as well as dated fixtures really scream, \\"I'm corny and from the 1980s.\\" Damn, someone needs to make it feel more high-end or lounge-y. \\n\\nThey also need to play music, in order to make the space feel more lively.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\nI will pay a premium for great food, but I don't think $60+ for three, mediocre courses is worth my hard-earned dollars. And when factoring in the bourgeoning, diverse, and competitive ATL food scene, I can't recommend people that love to support local and foodies to spend their money there. \\n\\nMy total meal neared close to $200. I could've had a tastier and more satisfying meal for less than half the price elsewhere. Easily. \\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nNikolai's Roof has the immense potential to be something special, but they need to better invest in their quality of food and space. I really do wish them well, and maybe sometime in the future I'll return, but I simply cannot recommend this place no matter how hard I try. \\n\\nTD;LR I ended up cooking my girlfriend a meal at home two months later, and she said yes."},{"name":"Bits & Bites Cafe","address":"912 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"I am a soup person and hands down they have the best chicken lemon rice soup I have had in years!

The restaurant's location is perfect.  It's near the Kenmore T Station, and close enough to be a very short walk to Fenway Park.  (You can see the ballpark from the restaurant.)  Yet it's enough away from the bars & restaurants immediately surrounding the ballpark which can get way too packed and sometimes unruly.  I feel that people who write negative reviews are usually looking for little things that somehow make it a \\"bad\\" experience anyways, and they really need to loosen up.  (I highly doubt they would take the time to post a great review; even if they miraculously felt they had a positive experience.)  So don't pay any attention to them.  Go to UNO's, grab a cold beer, order some tasty nachos, wings, or a deep dish pizza, watch the game on the big TV's, listen to some tunes, shoot the breeze with your friends, family, and the restaurant staff, and just ENJOY life.  This is a solid casual restaurant right by Fenway with great eats, drinks, and a top-notch staff.

I don't mind too much, but I know some people hate that. A couple small TVs, no audio. Music was classic rock hits (lots of Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks, Bowie, Tom Petty, CCR, Pink Floyd, etc). But thought I heard Danzig too. I had a nice wooden table, steel frame, stool high, by a window. But I noticed other tables were laminate topped, kinda cheap looking. The high tables are a smart choice, kudos to Loowit for that. I think there might be low tables on the other side, but I didn't think to look. It was warm on my January visit, even by the big old window, and I appreciated that. The Loowit branding was evident, but not oppressive. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nIt's that order-at-the-bar-and-we'll-bring-it-to-you format. So I don't have much to say. No problems though. \\n\\nBEER: \\nMy RIS and Baltic were fine, but the Mexican Stout was a bit unbalanced, perfumey, soapy (but not nasty). I've had at least two bottled Loowit products. Overall, I'd say they know what they're doing. I appreciate that they're slightly adventurous, but at the same time, because it's 2019, IPAs were over-represented. \\n\\nFOOD: \\nThere were some interesting menu items. I had a grilled cheese sandwich, which was described as \\"Grilled cheese sandwich on toasted sour dough\\". Well, yeah. When I saw \\"grilled cheese\\" in the sandwich section, I knew it was a grilled cheese sandwich. No need to describe it as a grilled cheese sandwich. Oh, and it's sourdough, not sour dough. Grilled sour dough would be really unsatisfying, I suspect. Anyway, I admire them for offering a grilled cheese sandwich with onion, tomato, and fried egg. It inexplicably came with bacon too. For my side, I had Deep Fried Brussel[sic] Sprouts. Seemed risky, but I'll try anything once. They were salty and buttery, as if they were sauteed in butter. The separated leaves were overdone, but easy enough to avoid.  The blueberry cheesecake balls were just three little spheres of sweet frothy cream cheese sprinkled with a little graham and drizzled with blueberry syrup. Disappointing, but hey, you can't expect much for $3, and they were undeniably tasty.  \\n \\nPRESENTATION:\\nPaper on a metal tray. Tacky, but I've seen much worse. Glassware was appropriate, no complaints there. Looked to me like they serve 32 pours in a mason jar with a snap-on handle. I wasn't quite sure what the deal was there.  \\n\\nPRICE/VALUE:\\nFair. I spent $28 for essentially a big snack with 26 oz of beer, but if I hadn't looked at the prices I would have expected around 24, and there's tax to consider, so I'll say they're in the ballpark.  \\n\\nRESTROOMS: \\nTwo, single occupancy, genderless. Two of my biggest gripes about restrooms: Lock didn't inspire confidence, and my paper towel dispenser jammed.\\n\\nOVERALL:\\nIt was a pleasant place to hang out for an hour or two.

This includes barring late arriving patrons, popcorn in buckets instead of bags because they are less noisy (seriously?) and a low risk smattering of low risk/broadly distributed Indy movies mixed in with the mainstream fare they actually trade in.\\n\\nThe thing with ArcLight is they seem to have lost touch with the times.  A pioneer in reserved seating, that's now available pretty much everywhere.  And the stadium seating that their pre-movie commercial acclaims as such a great thing is such a very decidedly 90's sort of innovation it barely qualifies as quaint that they would try to make something of it.\\n\\nBut this is an ArcLight with a difference - recliners!!!!\\n\\nAnd so Ive awaited its opening with hopes it would deliver something no Aarclight Ive experienced has done before:  film obsessive compulsive purism plus creature comforts that serve the customer buying a ticket rather than the director or actor who want you to hang on their every word and gesture as though your life depended on it.\\n\\nAnd there's the rub.\\n\\nOn arriving I was struck that unlike the Icon in Seaport, the garage doesn't deliver you to the theater.  You have to walk around the building on an outdoor sidewalk to get to the front door.  What a privilege for your parking fee (more on that later).  That will be fun when it starts snowing in earnest.\\n\\nAnd the entry is pretty starkly utilitarian in a modern sort of way.  But once up an escalator you are delivered to a mini lobby, with a mini bar and a fully automated mini concession stand.\\n\\nThe AMCs entry in Somerville looks like a football stadium in comparison.\\n\\nHmmmmm.\\n\\nAnd the menu?  Literally just 2 preparations of hot dogs, popcorn and a half dozen candies.\\n\\nHmmmm.\\n\\nAnd on to the theater.  A nice sized hall with recliners.  All is good, right?  Yes?\\n\\nNo.  The seats are firm to the point of therapeutic and of the most bizarre design.  Hard fabric covered things with narrow arm rests, tall backs and 8 inch tall headrests on top.\\n\\nSitting in one I was struck by a few things.  They are hard.  The top of the seat back leans back so far that if you recline the seat and lean back to relax your head it will be pointed at the ceiling.  So to see the screen you have to lean your head forward while reclined.\\n\\nLet me tell you just how comfortable that is.  On the other hand, let me tell you the truth - it really and truly sucks.  Did no one sit in these things before they bought them?   The ArcLight hype is that every seat is designed to provide the optimum viewing angle.  Apparently that only occurs if you torture your neck and leave with a crick in it.\\n\\nI moved forward in the largely vacant theater a few rows at a time as the movie played.  The closer to the screen I got, the better the seat angle worked, but unfortunately, by the time it did, the second problem presented itself.\\n\\nThe 8 inch tall headrests on the the rows in front stuck up in front of the screen as though the heads of patrons of a cinema from the 60s.\\n\\nWonderful.  Hard, uncomfortable recliners that are torturous to sit in in any way other than not reclined that cause pain when they are unless you sit where the seats in front of you obscure your vision of the purity of true cinema.\\n\\nThe only way I could sit that didn't hurt (initially) was to scoot forward in the seat so far my head rested on the seat back with my legs hanging half the way off the kick out reclining foot rest.\\n\\nThat is literally half as comfortable as it sounds.\\n\\nI left 3/4ths of the way through Knives Out in spite of the promised post movie prerecorded interview with the director.  It felt as if I hung around for that I would have needed orthopedic surgery.\\n\\nSo forget the recliners.  Buy a ticket to a non reclining seat in the back third of the theater the way god (ArcLight) intended and take your movie medicine.  Sit bolt upright, transfixed on the screen the way Hollywood intended without the slightest concern for your own comfort or preference, never mind a superior user experience served up at AMC Assemby Row, AMC Southbay, Icon Seaport, Superlux....fill in the blank.\\n\\nOh yeah.  The parking.  That was the saving grace.  Parking in the North garage on a vacant night only cost $40.\\n\\n$40 freaking dollars.

Our food took extremely long and then everything was brought out at the same time. The soup flavor was mediocre as was the cheese on top. By the time I finished the soup my entr√©e was getting cold.

However I would save your money to spend at the many shops and restaurants.\\n\\nThere are 62 dining options.  We  have eaten at a few including Boathouse, and the Edison. Of course dessert at Ghirardelli's is always a treat  Many of the restaurants are upscale and run by celebrity chefs (Chef Art Smith's Homecomin', Frontera Cocina (by Rick Bayless), and the upcoming Jaleo by Jose Andres. Some restaurants like Raglan Road and Rainforest Cafe are more middle of the road. There are also plenty of reasonable options like Blaze and the Chicken Guy!  If you want to eat in a sit down restaurant during popular hours, I suggest making a reservation. \\n\\nGet your steps in as you check out the 110 shopping options at Disney Springs. This is definitely not discount shopping but there are a large variety of items. Of course there are stores with Disney merchandise, including a Disney Pin Store. You can also find merchandise of all kinds:  Clothing, make-up, jewelry, food, shoes. glasses. The day after Black Friday there were no sales. At Under Armour I found a jacket I liked.

We planned a hiking trip to stop by this place (though the weather didn't work out). It didn't live up to our expectation. We ordered the chicken karaage, spicy miso ramen and Shoyu ramen. The chicken karaage with the Yuzu mayo is lovely. The chicken is juicy and the yuzu flavour adds an extra taste of freshness. We did not like our ramen. The Shoyu ramen is salty. You can't taste the broth in the ramen other than salt. The spiciness in the spicy miso ramen overpowers all other flavours in the bowl. The noodle is cooked perfectly. It's chewy and not over cooked. The chashu has a nice char and fragrant but it's not cooked in the traditional Japanese way where they braised the pork. The presentation of the food is good. The bowl is not big though(inverted triangle kind of bowl). For the price they charge, it is on the expensive side. The plus side is that the place has lots of street parking around. Anyways, from chatting with our server, the place was opened by two Canadian Japanese siblings who named the place after their grandfather. I think that is so cute."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Mustard & Brown Sugar Crusted Prime Ribeye. That's all you need to know.

Shares a parking lot with a bunch of other shops in the same shopping center. There are some parking spots in the back if the front lot is full.\\n\\nService: 3\\nThe service could be improved. The first time I barely got any service but I figured it was cause it was super packed. The service still lacked when I went for the second time and there were hardly any tables. They don't really check to see if you need to order more dishes unless you signal the waiters to come over. And it seems like they can only bring over 1 dish per item even when I ordered more than one. So be sure to order a lot of varieties the first time when you fill out the order form. Both times they missed 1 or 2 items that I ordered, which is really annoying. \\n\\nFood: 4\\nI have to say, they do have a good variety of meat and vegetable dishes! And they all seem pretty fresh. They slice the meat on the spot and the quality is very tender. They also have snow pea tips, water cress, lotus root, and some other relatively expensive vegetables. For the super FOBs or Asian parents, they also have pork intestine, liver, tripe, and other interesting parts of the animal. There are also many flower based products such as soup dumplings, meat buns, sesame pancakes, fried dough, and dry ramen. These products taste mediocre, nothing too special. They probably bought it frozen from the grocery store. One con for the menu is that they lack on seafood, and most the seafood items cost extra. I guess you can't ask much for $18.95. I usually get the double soup base - 1/2 spicy 1/2 nutrition - and the nutritional one is fairly bland.\\n\\nOverall: 3.5\\nI would come back if I'm craving hot pot one day and don't feel like putting in the effort to prepare it at home."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I feel like this place is a must if you're visiting Boston.

I tried the ricotta, the florentine, and the expresso with the florentine being the pricier out of the three (probably because it uses a different cannoli shell than the others). The florentine was probably my favorite out of the three as well. If you prefer simple flavors, the ricotta is a good option.\\n\\nWhat I liked about Mike's is that their cannolis weren't overly sweet. They're also super fresh so you should eat them as soon as you get them. I did manage to transport some back to CA and Mike's packaging survived my flight home. Although the shell wasn't as flaky by the time I got home, they still tasted great.

I must admit that I was surprised at how long it took to get the sandwiches, but I was also quite hungry, so it could have just been me. \\n\\nThe grilled chicken was decent, but it was the pork that was my favorite.  Unfortunately for me, I'd read Sean M's review about the mayonnaise, so I was a little uncomfortable when I saw it coming out one end of the sandwich, but opted just to wipe off the excess and keep eating.

It's a little pricey for the atmosphere but the food was of good quality which made me visit again and again. \\n\\nHowever, things have been changing (in my opinion) and going downhill with each visit. My first poor experience with SC was probably a year ago when they wouldn't let me in to eat without paying a cover charge. Mind you, I wasn't there to sing or to be entertained. I had 2 other people as well. I guess they didn't need the business because we only wanted to eat and leave but paying $15 just to get in before we even ordered on top of what would have been another $55 easy for food... Needless to say I didn't say. \\n\\nJust a few months ago I took a friend for her first time. We went on an evening and to their defense they were busy but the food alone took over an hour. Not to mention in the meantime I couldn't have a glass of water while I waited I had to pay for a bottle or buy a beverage even though I ordered food. No one ever checked back on us and acted annoyed when we tried asking for something. The food came out... and it was delicious. So I let the service and wait go without complaining. \\n\\nThis time I had company from California (and she too used to love SC before she moved away less than a year ago)! Since she's 79 and not sure when her next trip back across the country would be we decided to come in for dinner. This time was absolutely the last straw. We waited 15 minutes at our table without a single ounce of acknowledgement. I proceeded to the bar to place a drink and the bartender looked at me and said it would be a minute but never acknowledged me again, so again I stood waiting. Luckily someone else was working and offered to assist me. I explained I wanted to place a drink and food order and expressed how we waited for a while before anyone came over and the bartender snapped at me and basically said they were busy without any kind of sympathy. \\n\\nI placed our order, waited 45 minutes and finally the food arrived. The blackened chicken was tough and over cooked, the once creamy mac and cheese was cold and dry and the other part of my order was wrong. At this point another guest I brought (another first timer as well) wondered why we hyped this place up so much. The staff wasn't very friendly or empathic at all but removed one of the meals from the bill. They were incredibly rude to us from the time we got there until the time we left. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I'll absolutely not be returning. Customer service is important. Kindness in general is important. I'm truly sorry to even have to write this review but have a right to share my experience. \\n\\nI believe this place has potential but lately it's really lacking. I remember the days of great customer service and delicious food I once had here, but won't be visiting anymore. \\n\\nThis tonight is by far the hands down worst restaurant experience I've ever had."},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Two words...Thanksgiving.

Basically what this means is that you have a reservation but you may not get seated immediately. They also take walk ins. With priority seating we only waited about 20 mins. \\n\\nSo this restaurant stresses business casual so imagine my surprise when I see people with jeans, flip flops, tank tops...the ambiance in this place was severely lacking. Ugh. Let those people walk in their on any other day...but I digress. \\n\\nThe buffet had a pretty good variety of food. Turkey, Ham, Prime rib, Salmon, Blacked Fish...all very tasty. The turkey was a bit salty and I would have preferred it to be in slices instead of chunks. Other thank that everything was very good. Oh and the macaroni and cheese was the best I've ever tasted. I'm not kidding either. It was totally the highlight. The desserts were plentiful but a little lackluster. Save your calories for the food. \\n\\nService was excellent with two to three servers assigned per table. Overall, this was a great experience.

The band played a variety of adult contemporary crowd-pleasers, and they paid special attention to the birthday boy in our group to help him feel like the coolest guy there.

A wonderful surprise awaits with an updated, open, airy lobby. The Rooms are nicely appointed, large and updated with a fresh clean crisp look. Not the expected beachy tropical theme, instead you'll find a clean bright contemporary space. The bathrooms are spacious although the fixtures are outdated. The restaurant food is really good. Try the blackened fish sandwich and the mushroom fries. Very good!\\n\\nNegatives : restaurant - no corking fee option. Disappointing. \\n\\nBar service is non-existent and restaurant service is just a notch or two better. Slow with a bit of a language barrier in most of my interactions. The bartenders are not waiters. I mean i guess that's their marching orders so if eating at the bar, arrive prepared to be your own waiter. The bartenders rarely came to check on us and to get more drinks i had to leave our table to stand at the bar and order more. The bar is not open until later on the day so grabbing drinks to enjoy by the pool is limited as to what you are able to request the restaurant servers pull from behind the bar.

Finally got to eat here. Welcome to my veggie sausage mini-novel.\\n\\nWe came with a rather large party (8 initially, plus 3 more who joined shortly after) on a Friday night around 8:30. It was balls cold outside and had just finished drizzling. Indoors was absolutely packed and the wait was 1.5 or more hours. Outside, they were seating immediately. We were super hungry and planned on spending the rest of the night on Rainey anyway, so we just decided to sit outside rather than find a new place to eat.\\n\\nIt was a little strange that the outdoor area was completely open though - no heaters and no covering. The waitress explained to us that since it warmed up a few days prior, they took down and put away all of their cold weather gear. That's kind of really stupid when you consider a. it's February and b. It's Texas, where weather changes constantly. Four days of warmish weather in what is typically our coldest month of the year does not mean winter's over. But I digress.\\n\\nWe ordered several apps; cheese fries without the bacon, fried cheese curds, and spicy fried pickles. Everything was delicious, but my favorite was probably the cheese fries. So, so good. The fried cheese curds were very mozzarella stick-like but not as firm.. and the fried pickles were pretty damn spicy.\\n\\nAfter reading Yelp reviews I was a little afraid they'd be out of the veggie sausage like so many others have experienced, but they had both kinds! I went with the beet goat cheese and asked the waitress for a recommendation between the preztel and kolache bun; she said pretzel, definitely, so I went with that. I chose the sweet peppers, caramelized onion, garlic aioli, and mustard as my toppings.\\n\\nThe sausage itself was great. I couldn't detect any beet or goat cheese flavor, but I also had a lot of other stuff going on. Loved all the toppings too.. the whole thing was messy but it was great. The only thing that wasn't great was the pretzel bun... fuck that bun. It was super dry and dense and way too bready and just not enjoyable at all. I ended up pulling most of the bread off and eating the sausage & toppings alone. I noticed one of the other people in our group who got the pretzel bun doing the same. Dammit. Should have gone with the kolache.\\n\\nI also got the jalapeno creamed corn on the side. Jesus, it was delicious. I love spicy everything but this may have been erring on the side of too spicy. It was easy enough to eat around the jalapeno slices though when it got to be too much. My biggest complaint with this dish was that it was served in a short and fat mason jar. I get it, it's a cute idea (freaking Pinterest), but the narrow opening on the top? Not good. It's not easy to eat out of and I couldn't get the corn out of the bottom at the end... which made me sad. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the other veggie dog, which was asparagus-mushroom, on the pumpernickel bun. He loved it. He's a pescatarian who generally doesn't go down the fake meat path and was pretty hesitant about the whole veggie sausage thing, but he was all over that dog once he got it. I got to try a bite and indeed, it was good (so was the pumpernickel bun. Dammit!!). I think I liked my sausage a little more though.\\n\\nLooking forward to going back, but under three conditions: when it's not balls cold, I will get the kolache bun, and I will not stuff myself silly. Following your dinner at Banger's with several hours of standing and drinking on Rainey while stuffed silly completely sucks."},{"name":"Asian Gourmet","address":"794 Elm St","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"I almost gave this restaurant 4 stars, but the food was too good to not give a full 5.

Chilaquiles were top-notch: the most appropriate level of spiciness + hot chips + runny egg + avocado = random cravings, and paired great with the drinks. The egg in a whole was also very good, but not as memorable and felt significantly heavier (note that Boston brunches serving banana bread with something savory seems to be a trend?) - the combination was fine, but it did feel like eating disjointed elements, especially given that we were sharing.

We arrive shortly after they opened so we were seated at one of the tables up front.\\n\\nFirst off--their menu online is a bit different from the one that is in the restaurant, which is a little pet peeve of mine. I was excited to try their pastrami steak and scallops, but those dishes have since been taken off the menu.\\n\\nFor our meal, we decided to try a number of small plates and split them:\\n\\nFlatbread and spreads (4 stars): This dish was pretty good and consisted of three different spreads and a good helping of sesame flatbread. My boyfriend I agreed that the cauliflower tzatziki spread was our least favorite, but the other two were very good--with the piquillo-almond being our top choice.\\n\\nSteak tartare (4 stars): This is one of the new dishes on the menu. I can't even remember all of the ingredients in the tartare, but it was delicious all paired together on top of the crispy crostinis. This was almost a 5-star dish for me, but I would have liked to have a little bit more flavor from the steak overall.\\n\\nCarrot and citrus salad (4 stars): This was a new dish on the menu as well and was a nicely plated dish. The flavors were all very complementary and paired well with the cheese at the bottom of the dish. I thought that the price was a bit high for what was on the plate, but there was great flavor throughout.\\n\\nDuck meatballs (5 stars): This dish was a good size as it came with 4 meatballs on a bed of almonds, grapes, jicama, and mint. The meatballs reminded me a bit of falafel as they were sort of dry, but they went very well with the fresh mix of salad below. The complete bite of meatball and mixed salad was quite tasty.\\n\\nLamb neck (5 stars): This was definitely my favorite dish of the night. I LOVE lamb, and this dish did not disappoint. Pair perfectly cooked lamb with delicious ricotta dumplings and you are in heaven. There wasn't a ton of lamb in this dish, but every little piece was packed with flavor.\\n\\nDevil's Food Cake (3 stars): This dessert was pretty good--but didn't blow me away as much as I had hoped based on our waitress's recommendation. The cake had great flavor and was very rich, but neither the boyfriend or I really cared for the ice cream that it was served with.\\n\\nAfter-dinner chocolate (5 stars): If we had not gotten dessert, this would have been the perfect ending to our meal. Nevertheless, it was still a great finale after our dessert and had just the right amount of sweetness.\\n\\nOverall, this place has some great dishes and the food comes out quickly. One of my main gripes about this place is that the menu is somewhat limited and they feature a couple of ingredients in several of their dishes.

We got there at 8 pm and still had a 50 min. wait - fine, no problem - but after waiting 55 minutes, we walked in and half of the place was empty and remained empty (not even the \\"busy cleaning tables from people who just got up\\" but these tables were dry and set) so it begs the question, why the wait?  Our server wasn't even busy and could be seen standing around, chatting with some of the other staff.  Then we waited an hour for our food to come out - again, not busy, 1/2 empty restaurant at 9 pm at night and we had to wait an hour???  The food, like last time, was literally just \\"OK\\" - nothing terrible but also nothing to write home about (it was a little like airport food - you don't expect good cuisine from the lone restaurant that's near the gates but you expect to find \\"OK\\" food, not really hot, not really flavorful, but you aren't starving after).  My son had some type of allergic reaction from his meal breaking out in hives - while the manager did stop over to see if there was anything that could be done (I told him I had Benadryl for him and he'd be fine), nothing was taken off of our bill - even the tea that I ordered but didn't take more than one sip from (it wasn't fresh brewed tea but rather a tea mix - this is the south, if you can't brew your own tea you don't belong here) and had replaced with water was still on my tab.  This place is really not worth the wait.  Go to the chocolate store in the front - that place is awesome and the chocolates are delicious - but save yourself the time and aggravation and don't visit the restaurant."},{"name":"Cartopia Food Carts","address":"1200 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food and experience of the atmosphere while visiting Portland.

Luckily, we decided to leave the restaurant for Sunday, prior to departing back to Miami and I'm so glad that we did.

The food definitely did not disappoint. I was in a table of five and we each ordered an appetizer and an entr√©e because we wanted to try it ALL. From the apps, the Crab & Artichoke Dip was definitely my favorite along with the Totchos. For my entr√©e-- I had ordered the Shrimp & Crab Macaroni but I substituted shrimp for chicken.

(Pictures included for all entrees, appetizers, drinks, and desserts.) \\n\\nService- **** Our server was very sweet and attentive-- however we waited an HOUR to get our appetizers. We were very upset and since our table was next to the kitchen, one of the managers overheard us talking about the delay and ran right over. He asked us what our appetizers were and I kid you not,  in a matter of 10 minutes we had all five apps that we ordered at the table. If it wasn't for that, I would have given a five star rating, but service and the pace of it is extremely important.\\nPrice- ***** The priciest plate at our table was mine-- totaling at $19.95, it was extremely reasonable. To be honest, their whole menu was reasonably priced and I would've even expected higher for its location. Most of the entrees were valued at $14.95 with the exception of maybe three or four which were the meat cuts and my dish.\\n\\nThis was a great experience and I definitely want to return once the restaurant has some tenure.

They put a lot of gluten/flour in it so the texture was distinctly unmeat-like and the meat itself wasn't very good quality. \\n\\nThe steamed rice noodle was decent.

They're flat and made with rice flour; it was sweet and satisfying without being overly so. Both my dad and I were big fans. \\n\\nThe sweet milk buns were good but very filling due to the heaviness of the lotus seed and the fluffiness of the bun. It was well made though. My dad wasn't a huge fan of these, but I liked them. \\n\\nFried sesame balls are one of my favorite dim sum dishes. These were decent but not great. I usually like mine to have some give in them, but these were fried to the point of us being unable to pick them up with chopsticks. \\n\\nThe short ribs were the only meat dish that actually tasted like meat. Probably because you can't really add any flour to it to cut costs. The meat was decent though the flavoring a little too sweet. \\n\\nOverall, not a bad dim sum place, though I still prefer Windsor. China Pearl doesn't have the selection of dumplings that Windsor has. They have a few steamed ones and \\"fried\\" ones, but when the cart for the fried ones came around, they looked greasy and unappetizing so I passed on that.

I'm happy for them.  Unfortunately, that means that you can't go in and order a few doughnuts without wading though a looong line in a packed, tiny space that is poorly designed and has no seating while you wait for even a simple order.  \\n\\nAnother Portland place that's a victim of it's own success.  Pip's has already joined the ranks of pok pok, voodoo etc.  Meaning that you will be enduring the company of many people from LA, families visiting their hipster children, lots of yuppie/hipster parents with \\"cute\\" kids, and other gross moneyed folks.  It's no longer a actual food establishment, now it's a ride in the theme park of Portlandia.  \\n\\nThe first time I went in, the line was out the door.  It took ten minutes to get to front of line.  I asked how long the wait was for a dozen doughnuts, and the counter person shrugged and said \\"no way to know\\".  The counter person is also responsible for helping with drink prep.  So, after waiting in line for ten minutes, rather than take my order the counter person steps away and begins steaming milk in a long list of drink orders.  The wait for my doughnuts after ordering was about 15 minutes.  25 minutes to get a few doughnuts.  They're good but they're not that good.    \\n\\nThe second time I visited,  there appeared to be very little customer traffic, so I took another chance....But, the couple in front of me (from LA by their looks and overheard convo), ordered multiple dozens of doughnuts....that all had to made to order before my small order was prepared.  Again, before taking my order the counter person walked away to prep drinks without a \\"I'll be with you in a moment\\" or even eye contact.  There were 4 people behind the counter and only two other customers at the time, but it looked like I'd be waiting a half hour again to get a simple order!\\n\\nSo, I left, with a sigh and a resignation that I would probably never eat another Pip's doughnut, as good as they are.

She's a chocolate fiend, so, natch, we had dinner at the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium & Savory Feast Kitchen (whew, that's a mouthful, and yes, they make the servers refer to it in full).  Wait time was about 40 minutes on a Thursday night at 7 pm, which is right when Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure kick out the hordes and they filter out through CityWalk maybe looking to extend the day at the nearby bars and restaurants.  The process was easy enough though, thanks to modern technology (SMS text messaging through your own phone).  The schtick is Steampunk Willy Wonka, the draw is beautifully, quality, chocolates and sweets (crafted lollipops and marshmallows, to name a few) and ridiculous, behemoth milkshakes.  The savory side of the kitchen does a pretty good job, considering we're in basically a theme park.  Decided to go with a pile of apps rather than traditional entrees.  Roasted Brussels Sprouts were very tasty, plenty of creamy jalape√±o mayo and cotija cheese, had a decent kick and nice smokey heat from the ancho chile powder dusting.  Fried Zucchini were fine, golden brown, well-fried sticks, very eggy bound breading, ordinary.  Truffle Fries were crispy and shiny translucent with grease, well-seasoned, and scented with that synthetic truffle oil (2,4-dithiapentane) that has the strong, musty, artificial mushroom essence.  They were tasty, but seriously, a theme park is not blowing a $1000 per pound item on flocks of pasty tourists.  Coffee and Chocolate Stout Chicken Wings had a sticky sweet-savory glaze, tasted like it was made from a stout (and soy sauce), not necessarily from coffee or chocolate, in case you were misled.  Pork Belly Sliders were enjoyed the most of these all.  We liked the fatty, moist pork on the tender pretzel rolls, def needed more of the mustard schmear (rather than just a plate garnish), and do enjoy the chocolate dipped bacon.  Of course, being in a them park, there were fully garbed characters wandering around, interacting with the patrons (loudly, in bad English accents).  This was not our thing, but the kids in the dining room really seemed to enjoy the act.  We had a rock star view by the panoramic window on the 2nd floor of the dining room by the bar.

I grew up spoiled so sue me! But I will say that the pie exceeded my expectations here at Broadway. It wasn't perfection but it should satisfy my future pizza cravings here in Altamonte Springs. In addition to the pizza, I ordered a Greek salad and Broadway bites. The salad was really good but I specifically asked for no olives and managed to get them anyway. Not sure if it was a server issue or kitchen issue but I quietly picked them off and let it slide. The bites were another tasty starter. They had a good ratio of garlic, butter, and cheese. The marinara dipping sauce served with it was also on point. A really yummy red sauce. \\n\\nNow, here's where I found fault with this place. TOO MUCH PLASTIC! Yes I'm yelling but they served salad dressing in plastic containers and the dipping sauce in a plastic container as well. I understand that this is necessary with take out but why on earth would you do this for dine in patrons? Why not just use a small ramekin? Cut your footprint down, Broadway! \\n\\nOtherwise, this place seems like a good go to for pizza, drinks, and late night bites.

The menu offers traditional sushi rolls: our favorite is the yellowtail with jalapeno.  We also love the dynamite sashimi (again yellowtail with ponsu and fresno chilis).   Potstickers are good - fried are better than steamed.  I also enjoyed the Korean bibimbop on this visit. \\n\\nThere is one main drawback, however, that has been manifested on EVERY visit (we have been here about 10 times over the last 5 years)...let me preface my comment that it is not the restaurant's fault...\\n\\nSo, here goes: there are ALWAYS (and I really mean that) very poorly behaved children whose parents let them scream with nary a correction or word.  Your experience will largely depend on your proximity to said screaming children.  On this visit, the offender was in the back, so we sat at the sushi bar towards the front, and the noise - while still audible - was somewhat buffered.

Although they offer taco Tuesday's it's very rare to be able to attend an event here, from what I could find.\\n\\nMy husband and I have attended several cooking classes throughout Columbus and the east coast, we like learning to make meals at home.  I was most looking forward to making pasta.  My in laws are Italian and I thought this skill may really come in handy one day!  But this cooking instruction left me disappointed.  We only rolled the pasta through an attachment in a Kitchenaid, and no we don't own one of those at home.  It would've been really great if they demonstrated how to make the dough or had the attendees make dough ourselves.  \\n\\nThe other stations were dessert and a salad.  The salad was pretty simple and the dessert was partly completed for us. There was also a rabbit tomato sauce they made for us without instruction.  It was just OK.  I find rabbit too gamy for my taste.  The noodles were great though!  Yum-mers.  I can't remember the last time I had homemade noodles. Would've loved more instruction there.  I was also disappointed we didn't get to take any food home. At $60 per person the price was high in comparison to other cooking classes and some complimentary cocktails or homemade noodles to take home would've been a nice touch.\\n\\nThe space was really beautifully designed and I could sit and chat there all day, I felt so at home.

The food was good, but not what I was expecting. Here's what happened:\\n\\nSo, at the Columbus Food Truck festival, they delayed the opening of the truck seemingly to a) create an absurdly long line to give an inflated sense of demand and b) take their time setting up. One star gone. And once I got up to the window, they informed me there was a \\"limited menu\\". So I only was able to get \\"chicken bites\\": little pieces of cut up breasts, one half slice of bread, and a pickle. No sides other than ranch dipping sauce and pudding were offered. So there's another star gone. And once I did get my food, it was served in an open tray, with no cover. The delay in them opening meant I had to get back to work; my lunch break was over... So when I asked if they had a clamshell container and a bag, they had neither. So I had to walk a half mile back to the office holding uncovered chicken and hoping it wouldn't spill out. It was cold by the time I got back to my desk. Another star gone. \\n\\nSo, just for ok chicken that's not normally on the menu, no sides, and ill-consideration for their patrons, they get two stars. I might give the North Market standalone another try, but I'm hesitant to give them more money.

Back then, it was called Downtown Disney and was kind of a disjointed hybrid of shopping, nightclubs, and restaurants. After a major overhaul, it became Disney Springs - a sort of perfected vision of what was originally intended. While it's unmistakably Disney, there are a number of non-Disney shops and restaurants that give it a feel that you're not really in Disney. As such, I feel it appeals to vacationers as well as the locals. \\n\\nI really applaud Disney for doing a great job with their take on the whole eat-play-live-entertain design of DS. I've seen a number of these multi-purpose complexes pop up in New York but none really come close to DS (having that Disney money doesn't hurt their cause ;-). Shopping is abundant - there are a lot of designer stores like Coach, Kate Spade, etc as well as Disney-centric places like World of Disney (which has recently been beautifully renovated). I'm really impressed with the dining selection too - a number of counter service spots as well as sit down restaurants. I've dined and sampled from a number of places here and there really is something for everyone. \\n\\nOverall, DS is definitely an upgrade from its predecessor, and worth stopping by while in Disney for some hardcore shopping or dining."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is just a review for the Chocolate Shop as we had a group of 14 and the wait for the restaurant was over an hour.

However the decor is really cook with a strong steampunk vibe. \\n\\nThe candy cases are neatly arranged and tagged with the items names, however if you want to know prices you have to ask an employee.  This is also where the in-efficiencies begin. When you want to purchase anything from the cases you wait for an employee to help you, which is normal, however different employees manage different cases. So after you have made your picks from the chocolates case, they give you a number and put your items aside while you move to another case and wait for the next employee to assist you and so one through the 3 different sets of cases. Once you are finished you take your number and wait in the line to be rung up on the register. It took my friend at least 20 minutes to buy 6 chocolates and a chocolate mousse cup.

But alas, things didn't go quite according to plan mainly because we played \\"Drinking Around the World\\" (11 countries, 11 drinks) at Epcot right before our dinner reservation. Let's just say that we took most of our food to go to eat the next day (still just as good the next day after we microwaved it) since my husband could barely keep his head up during dinner. I highly suggest making recommendations MONTHS ahead of time because we tried 3 months ahead of time and was only able to secure a 9:30PM reservation time. Anyways, Le Cellier is a steakhouse located in Canada, Epcot. \\n\\nBecause we were technically in Canada, we HAD to start our meal with the Le Cellier Signature Poutine (Fresh-cut French Fries, Canadian Cheddar, Truffles, Red Wine Reduction). I have to say that everything about the poutine was fine except for the red wine reduction which unfortunately drenched everything. It was completely unnecessary and actually took away from the actual poutine itself because it just tasted of vinegar. I would pass on this next time for sure and just fill up on their delicious house pretzel bread (refills please). For our entrees, we ordered the Le Cellier Filet Mignon (AAA Canadian Tenderloin, Mushroom Risotto, Asparagus-Tomato Relish, Truffle-Butter Sauce), and the Black Angus Rib-Eye (Crisp Fingerling Potatoes, Nueske's Bacon Vinaigrette, Fris√©e, Heirloom Carrots, Cabernet Butter) with a side of Smoked Macaroni and Cheese. \\n\\nBoth steaks were melt in your mouth delicious but if I had to pick one, I highly recommend the filet mignon. It was seriously tasty and super tender. I absolutely loved the mushroom risotto it came with also. The rib-eye was also cooked properly but when compared with the filet mignon it fell a little short. It just wasn't AS tender. This microwaved beautifully the next day though! The macaroni and cheese had an excellent smokey flavor running through it and it was a decadent side to our steaks. We enjoyed it immensely. Our server was also very kind and patient throughout our entire meal. It was very obvious that my husband was sick from drinking but the server remained very professional about it and tried to just make it out like he was tired from a long day at the park. He even packed us a complimentary dessert to go (Chocolate Mousse) since we were on our honeymoon! \\n\\nI really wish that we had been sober for this meal since it's one of Disney's signature restaurants but it tasted really good even when slightly inebriated. I highly recommend dining here while at Epcot because it's probably one of the better meals you can get here. I mean who knew that you could get such a good steak at a theme park!

When I got it home and pulled out my first slice I was immediately disappointed.  The dough was raw! Not a little undercooked, but raw in the center. I was not too concerned as everyone makes mistakes every once in a while- figured I would pop it into the oven and enjoy this delicious pizza in a little while. My wife decided to call and inform them of the situation just in case there was something wrong with a oven or maybe a newer employee made a mistake.  When she called she was greeted by a person by the name of Kayla who was very nice and kindly handed the phone off to somone who stated he was \\"Thomas, the manager/co-owner\\". As my wife kindly explained the situation to him she was immediately treated like a criminal.  Thomas informed her that they could not do anything about it, and if she would like she could bring the pizza back tomorrow to show them proof of the uncooked pizza and maybe he could do a partial refund. Shocked at the lack of concern, she handed me the phone. When I kindly began explaining the situation to Thomas,  explaining to him that the money was not a cocern, I was just concerned that the pizza was not cooked, he quickly told me that he could not do anything about it and as far as they were concerned the pizza was cooked perfectly. I told him we were not going to drive all the way back because we do not live near the restaurant and that we thought we would bake it longer in our own oven- he sarcastically said, \\"Oh you already ate it? Big surprise!\\" He then told me to hold, set the phone down on the counter and in a very loud voice sarcastically explained the situation to someone else. When he got back on the phone he informed me that he called and spoke to the \\"big boss\\" and that they felt the same way. I am very disappointed.  These pies aren't cheap but in the past it was worth it for excellent quality food but not for a pie i have to bake myself after being talked to the way Thomas did to me and my wife. I have been going to flying pie since I was a kid, starting at the original location on Stark street in Portland.

Cumin mussels was lovely, especially if you have rice or bread to soak the sauce up. Lemongrass prawns was next, super tasty, filled by peppercorn lobster.....nicely done. Seventh item was Assam Scallops, cooked perfectly. I also have to commend them on nice cute china for the appetizer sized taster plates. Nice presentation all around. Rending beef came next, no complaints there. The samba okra is very tasty.....could have spent a few more seconds on the wok as it was a bit crunchy. The sable fish was tender inside and of good flavor. The coconut rice was very fragrant, and the Pisang gored was beautiful presented. However the batter did not taste as good as other Malaysian place. Overall good. To compliment the dishes, we ordered Char Kuey Teow, which was super delicious, and Nasi Goreng which hit the spot.

That way people - esp kids - who just want the standard food such as eggs, French toast, bacon, etc. can just grab their food quickly and keep the line moving.\\n\\nI paid a lot of money (almost $30/plate) and was only really able to get through the buffet line once.

Oddly people never talk about nightmares that artists and philosophers had during the time period. Perhaps even in those nightmares they never perceived that Renaissance hotel brand would exist. It is almost ironic that Renaissance hotels share the name, as many of them are as depressing as it gets within the Marriott brand. And that's saying a lot, because most of the portfolio is quite sad to begin with.\\n\\nTo start, this property is conveniently located to the airport and has comfortable bedding. I suspect that for most people, that's the only two requirements in an airport property. The lobby looks fresh and while nothing about it is notable other than the distressed fish at the check-in counter, it does not look as bland as your run of the mill Sheraton or Marriott. \\n\\nBeyond that however, things tend to turn quickly downhill. The room design is something out of a Reno motel, with bed design that could only have been selected by a heavy gambler and smoker at a cheap casino. Alternatively, it could be something that Rooms To Go Outlet would have had stuck on the floor for a year, waiting to be unloaded upon some unfortunate soul. The room is very cheaply decorated, very Fairfield Inn - ish. \\n\\nYet, the most depressing part had to be lounge. I can't say I am surprised after having stayed at other Renaissance properties in the US, but in their usual fashion, the bananas were basically rotten. The breakfast selections are extremely depressing. You've got the eggs, the mainstream cereals and the oatmeal from a Walmart shelf. It other words, a fairly typical Renaissance lounge. The airport shuttle is a nice feature and was on time. Checkin was quick and efficient. \\n\\nTo sum up, can't say this hotel is terrible, because I did get a comfortable night's rest and there were no major mishaps. It's bland, it's sad, it's underwhelming. It is the highlight Marriott Bonvoy brand's convoluted idea of Renaissance and the altered distressing reality in which their executives live."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"An absolutely must go here!

Disney several years ago started encouraging people to pre-visit reserve restaurant visits. I get it, but I also know we often don't know what our schedule is or how we will be feeling till a few days in advance as we only come down in preparation for a convention that is every 3 years & a long 5 days when it is going on.\\n\\nSo we decided to try for a reservation at a restaurant we had liked previously at Epcot. The lady that helped us seemed at the time super helpful and with it. We purchased Epcot tickets through her & the little watch like bands. She helped us find a reservation for the day we purchased tickets for. \\n\\nI HAVE NO IDEA what she did. Sooooo we received a confirmation for our preferred restaurant on the Epcot property. Great! The morning of our Epcot visit we were told that we had purchased Magic Kingdom tickets & wristbands. This is after we waited & waited on the bag check, then waited and waited on them instructing people on how to wave their wristband in front of the scanner. \\n\\nThen Disney gets all Big Brother & wants your finger prints. How do I tell them H#!! NO you may not have my finger print politely. Apparently there is no easy way to say this is a \\"freakin' amusement park & if I need to leave & get back in look at my freakin ticket & there is no reason you need my finger print for that\\". The brainwashed look at you like you are nuts for refusing.\\n\\nFunny thing -  the \\"my finger print is not gonna happen\\" statement still went faster than a grown woman trying to figure out how to wave her wristband at the reader & then smush her finger on the reader. \\n\\nSo after all that we had to relocate to the purchase tickets line... oh joy! At least I felt like we were at an amusement park, long lines, more clueless people in front of us & mediocre ending.\\n\\nWhen we finally got up to the window it was much like a \\"Who's on First\\" conversation. The lady whom I wish I got her name could not fathom why we were trying to get into Epcot when we had Magic Kingdom tickets & wristbands. After repeated explanations that a mistake was made by the Disney Services lady and several attempts by her to explain how to get to the Magic Kingdom property... she finally grasped the concept that a Human error occurred by a Disney person and we actually wanted to be at Epcot and not the Magic Kingdom. I didn't want to freak her out and tell her they are not all animatronic facsimiles of Humans. Baby steps.\\n\\nSo after several attempts she finally got our tickets & wristbands right. Now it is a CRAZY long security line & Good Lord give me patience for more people not getting the whole wave your little card or band & get finger printed like a good lil sheep. Upside is we did not get tackled by a prepubescent security person for trying to break into Epcot.   \\n\\nSo I guess the moral of the story is: make the person at guest services you bought the tickets & wristbands from confirm + paper document what park you purchased for along for what day."},{"name":"Massimino's","address":"207 Endicott St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I had dinner at Massiminos last night and had a wonderful dining experience.

The sushi chefs usually yell out a hello or a thank you as patrons come and go too, which I haven't experienced at other sushi places. \\n\\n-The fact that so many patrons are regulars says something about New Ginza's quality. Practically every time I'm there, I see the owner and other staff chatting away with other customers like they're old friends, and I've heard many people say that they go to New Ginza all the time because it's just so good.\\n\\n-Their lunch specials are pretty great deals. For $12, you can get salad, miso soup, just the perfect amount of sushi, and unlimited green tea. And that's only the special I've tried; there are a bunch of others that look equally as delicious and inexpensive.\\n\\nI can't count how many people I've recommended New Ginza to, and I know I'll be frequenting the restaurant for as long as I live in the area... and maybe even after that."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"YAY, I am a huge fan.

The house-made mozzarella was incredibly delicious! \\n\\nThe lasagna bolognese was killer good with a nice little kick to it. It was definitely better than your average lasagna.\\n\\nBoth wine selections we made were very good.\\n\\nThe ambiance and service were great. Our waters were constantly refilled, and our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. The music wasn't obnoxiously loud like you find in most new restaurants these days, so you can actually talk normally.\\n\\nTHE BAD:\\nWe ordered the pork chop daily special, and it fell far short of expectations. The risotto that came with it was perfectly al dente, but the porkchop was so overcooked that it was dry and almost crunchy. For the small portion at $38, I expect it to be cooked perfectly.\\n\\nWe got a side of polenta with what we believed was supposed to be a poached egg that should be broken at the table to add extra creamy richness to the dish, but what we got was a soft-boiled egg that we ended up just chopping up and mixing into the polenta.\\n\\nThe most unsettling thing of the meal was the water. There was some kind of grey, fuzzy sludge in my glass which I didn't see at first because the lighting was dim in the restaurant. Once I drank from the glass, the sludge went into my mouth, and I spat it back into the glass. I can't tell you what a disgusting experience it was. I tried to not make a big deal out of it and just alerted our server once she came back. She apologized, and when she replaced both of our waters, I suggested that she might find the guy with the water jug to clean it out. She assured me that she did. But the thing is, I kind of would have assumed that they would have gone around the dining room to change out everyone's water glass, because they'd been refilling everyone else's water out of the same jug. I definitely didn't see that happening. My husband kept telling me to switch to sparkling water or a flavored beverage, but I normally prefer plain water. I also assumed they had cleaned the jug and water dispenser, but honestly, I couldn't help but keep wiping my tongue off to get rid of the weird, fuzzy sensation from the sludge. I probably should have switched.

Bill was $45, seemed high on the phone, but were at Disney and it's 10 o'clock and I'm too tired to care. Turns out the prices aren't that bad, but they charge a $7.00 fee to deliver here.

The whole area around the restaurant is very beautiful and picturesque with excellent views of the mansions on Lake Travis and is in the perfect place to see the sunset on the lake. Many people thought we had a destination wedding based off our photos. We come every so often and walk around the shops or go up to the Oasis Brewery. In the Brewery we had the wagyu beef burger and the Beyond Meat burger. Both were excellent. I have never had a burger as flavorful as the wagyu beef burger. It has big windows all around and outdoor areas that give a 360 overlook!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Holy Cannoli! Rookie mistake.

The beer, the food, the service, and the build out of this location are all A+. \\n\\nThe build out here is huge. There's room to spread out, and they have many games available ranging from a Nintendo 64, to a board game library, to a large Jenga game, to a shuffle board table, and bocce ball court. \\n\\nTheir menu is a bit intense to get through. It's presented on a clipboard. There's a page for brunch & specials. A page for their beer, guest taps, and beers that will be available soon. A page for bottles. A page for food, and another page for dessert. It's all great, but there are a LOT of choices. \\n\\nPROPS: Overall great experience. \\nSLOPS: When I visited here, most of the stuff that they were brewing were IPAs and Pales. They were all great beers, but there wasn't as much diversity as some other breweries. (This location makes up for this, by the selection they have available on guest taps)."},{"name":"Hae Rim","address":"11729 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Delicious and extremely friendly service!

I think the main issue lies within the Grand Floridian itself and the Cafe just has to deal with it.***\\n\\nOn a rainy night, the night of my birthday, we came to see if there were any open reservations for dinner as room service was down for hours due to a huge lightening storm. Of course it was packed and they told us it would be an hour and a half wait. We did find a closer reservation time through the My Disney app so we made one for 8:35, about 30 minutes from when we originally inquired. When we came up for our reservation time, we were told we would have to wait..more. Never in my life have I had to wait 45 minutes after the reservation time to even be sat. Note that the time they close is 9:15 PM so the additional time would have pushed it over after the place closed. \\n\\nAfter speaking with the host stand multiple times, it seemed like the restaurant would stay open late but they \\"couldn't do anything\\" about the fact they had reservation spots opened yet could seat us until 45 minutes after that time. It was 9PM, I was sick, it was my birthday and the weather was crap so we had no other options other then going to the fast service place in the hotel. The craziest part was there were empty unbused tables and they just didn't have the man power to push two tables together. No pleas to the front staff did anything but luckily, our bell hop from a few days before saw us and went to talk to the manager, who quickly put together two tables and we finally got sat.\\n\\nIn my opinion, storms happen in Florida almost every day. If the restaurant can't handle more guests, remove the reservation slots online. Everyone may say \\"plan ahead, get an earlier table\\" but our plan was to do a fireworks boat cruise which obviously didn't work due to the storm. \\n\\nThe manager did make it up by coming over promptly to comp 2 appetizers and a bottle of wine. From there, our waitress was attentive and we had a good time inside. The food wasn't crazy special but I enjoyed my ravioli and my friends enjoyed their onion soup. Only food complaint was my boyfriend asked for medium rare steak and they definitely served him medium well. They even gave us a free birthday cupcake at the end which was excellent."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Every time I go to Austin I make sure I come here to watch the sunset.

They keep the room so dark that everyone is shining their phone flashlights on the menus, and those piercing lights regularly zap right into your eyes from nearby tables, just like the instrument that the ophthalmologist uses during a checkup. Why is this level of darkness necessary in a restaurant?\\n\\nThe atmosphere is like a club, meaning the music is LOUD while you dine. If that's your thing, fine, but forget about having conversations unless you like to yell. My ears were ringing after we left.\\n\\nThe food?
