I recommend the main dining room where you can enjoy the full experience. I've called Raglan Road my favorite Irish Pub but it's more like Irish fine dining. For our appetizer my wife and I shared a Scallop Forest. 6 lightly breaded sea scallops perched on cocktail forks. They literally melt in your mouth. I had the Braised Be. Beef, a 14 oz fork tender brisket served in a long handle pot with horseradish mashed potatoes and carrots. Brown gravy lined the bottom. Delicious. My wife had the \\"It's Not Bleedin Chowder\\" which is almost like chowder on a plate. Cuts of different fish and potatoes in a white wine cream broth. My wife is a very picky eater but she didn't care what kinds of fish were in the dish because it tasted so good. We shared a Black Forest Kiss for dessert. Perfect. The Guiness here is the smoothest and creamiest I've ever had. I don't know how they do it but it tastes so much better here than anywhere else I have ever had it. Scallop Forest, Guiness and Irish Coffee are automatic whenever we come.

Like many other places in Central Texas, the brisket didn't have much flavor.  It was good, but not as tender as many other places around here.  At other places (e.g. Smitty's in Lockhart), the brisket crumbles apart in your hands as you pull on it, and it will still do that at The Salt Lick, but you have to tug on it a little harder.\\n\\nThe sausage was really good, with a real strong smokey flavor.  The pork ribs were really good too - not baby back but very tender and not too salty and had a good flavor.  The potato salad was very tasty.  The veggies (pickles, onions, cole slaw) were all very fresh.  The iced tea seemed to be on the weak side - didn't have much flavor or personality.  The sauce was good, and almost had a mustard/vinegar base style.  There was spicy and original sauce - I liked the spicy better.\\n\\nThis place was very good, though, and all around is a very quality place.  Some places around Central Texas are really good in one thing (e.g. brisket), and everything else is just okay, but everything was high quality here, except ironically the beef brisket.  Again, the beef brisket was definitely good, but just not as tender nor flavorful as other places.\\n\\nIn terms of the top bbq places around Central Texas, this is definitely the most modern type place, with servers that try to give friendly professional service (e.g. like at an American Chain restaurant), and this place even had live music in the outside patio.  Heck, they even give you a plate, and a fork!  Note that this quality could either be a negative or positive thing, depending on what you're looking for.  If you're looking for an old-style bbq place, go to Smitty's in Lockheart or Louie Mueller in Taylor.\\n\\nThey also have all you can eat brisket/sausage/ribs for $20 including sides, which is unique and a good deal.  The prices for a plate tend to be very reasonable for a modern-type family-style restaurant, although I guess you have to top since there's waiter service, unlike a lot of the other top bbq places around here.  BYOB, which is also a nice concept.  Furthermore, they're open until 10 pm, which is pretty late for a bbq place around here."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've loved this place for so many years.

Was it some reference to YouTube? Was it a space themed club with sci-fi or futuristic decor? \\n\\nThe answer to all of that was no. It was literally just a long room with a bar and some tables with booths attached to the walls. I guess it was sort of a tube-shape? I still have no idea why it is called Tube. \\n\\nAnyway, the drinks were averagely priced for being downtown/Chinatown in Portland at a lounge or club. The lights were bright but the place was dim.

Like others have mentioned, you will walk into chaos once you pass the doors (during my visit, I started out my wait outside and then finally made it through the front gates, where there was a swarm of hungry people) and if it's your first time, be prepared to yield to those who know what they want to keep the traffic flowing. The better thing to do is to check out the menu and read reviews before going so that you can pretend you know what you're doing.\\n\\nThe price can be perceived as high, especially for people accustomed to getting 3 pizzas from Papa John's and the like for $20 but the pies here are pretty big and you know that the ingredients are top-notch. My group ordered the Margherita D.O.P. and San Gennaro that night and they were both pretty good. The problem is that the crust was charred more than most of the photos that my fellow Yelpers have posted, which ended up giving the pizza a bitter flavor that probably would have been nonexistent had the crust hadn't been left to burn too much. Finding a table was pretty difficult, but we knew that as we waiting in line and I had already read about the fiasco that the community seating area can be during busy times. You'll either love all the energy or hate it. I bet most actually enjoy this pretty unique dining arrangement but I quickly got tired of the hustle and bustle as parties shifted from table to table as space became available.\\n\\nI later tried Varuni Napoli, which is why I give Antico 3 stars.

They make ice cream out of liquid nitrogen! It's pretty fun to watch them make it and I imagine it would be very fun for kids.  Ice cream made from liquid nitrogen is supposed to be smoother with lots of small, uniformly distributed ice crystals so there aren't large chunks of ice. The ice cream was smooth but unfortunately not well frozen. I'm guessing they were being a little too stingy with the liquid nitrogen which is why my ice cream starting melting right away and had the texture of soft serve instead of ice cream. You can pick out the base, flavoring for the ice cream, and some mix-ins.  I chose Kahlua and oreos. They were apparently out of oreos and put in some oreo crumbs and substituted with mini chocolate chips.

Other than that the service was not too bad for a busy day.\\n\\nPirate paks:\\n\\n-Bacon Cheddar Burger (3/5): In the center of the ship sits the burger on top of some fries.

Tasted like a fast food burger. I could have sworn it tasted better the first time I came but that was at the richmond Centre location. The slaw was alright as well. Gave the meal a refreshing note. The fries were a big soggy and didn't feel fresh. When we ordered seconds, those were double fried and crispy. \\n\\n-Mediterranean Chicken Burger (2.5/5): Same assembly as the above. Chicken breast was a bit lopsided and was difficult to share amongst each other. In my opinion it was bland and a tad bit on the dry side. All other condiments were the same.\\n\\n-Toasted shrimp sandwich (3.5/5): Baby shrimps in white toast with some mayo, lettuce and chili sauce. The bread was golden and there was ample amount of sauce so that it's not too dry. This tasted the best out of the three PP we got. \\n\\nWe tried the vanilla (3/5) and strawberry (2.5/5) ice cream.

Back in the day when Mom would stand on the front porch of your Southern Lousiana home and call you in for dinner.  When dinner wasn't something thrown together in 30 minutes, but rather something that Mom had been babysitting for hours, maybe days.\\n\\nWho am I kidding?  I grew up in the suburbs of Houston.  But eating at Lola's left me with a sentimental feeling, yearning for the cajun childhood I never had.\\n\\nEating at Lola's is an experience.  You can't just look at the food or the decor or Lola herself.  It's all part of the package.\\n\\nFor me, the experience started at 5 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  We had decided to grab an early dinner because we were in the neighborhood, so we searched out Lola's.  It's interesting approaching her neck of the woods from the West side of I-35.  The East Side gentrification is very obvious, and there's almost a line drawn in the sand at the 11th Street/Rosewood split, where the old neighborhood is struggling to retain its character, as the increasing property value forces local favorites out of business.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at Lola's, a purple stripe amongst the beige neighbors, there was a sign on the door: \\"Around the corner.  Call ___-____.\\"  So we called, and sweet Lola explained that she'd just returned back in town a few minutes ago and was at the grocery store.  She apologized and said she'd be back around 5:45.  We told her to take her time, and that we'd definitely be back.\\n\\nWe decided to run some errands and returned at around 6.  Lola welcomed us in true Lousiana fashion into her restaurant.  The feel of the restaurant itself is homey with a lot of kitsch.  The sponge-painted walls were covered in collected memories from her home (New Orleans), bible verses, and bobble-head dolls.  \\n\\nAfter much debate between the two of us and recommendations from Lola, we placed our (huge) order: cajun tea (a mixture of fruit juices and sweet tea), a medium bowl of chicken and sausage gumbo, cajun breakfast rice with a fried pork chop, fried chicken wings with yams and green beans, and chicken, sausage, and shrimp jambalaya with smothered potatoes and black-eyed peas.  We knew this was going to be waaaay too much food, but we couldn't resist.  And everybody knows that cajun food leftovers are often better than the original meal. :)\\n\\nLola got to work, pulling pots of goodies out of her fridges and throwing meat into the fryer.  Our food trickled out as it was ready.\\n-Cajun tea: Delicious!  It tastes more like strawberry lemonade than anything else, but very good.\\n-Gumbo: Wow...so good!  If she uses a roux, it's a light roux, which I love.  The chicken was fall-apart, and the sausage (which I'm usually not a big fan of) added a lot of flavor and substance.\\n-Chicken wings: One order comes with 5, and it's a LOT of food.  They're perfectly crispy, and they came with some sort of seasoned-salt on top.  Whatever it was, it was tasty!\\n-Breakfast rice:  The name doesn't really describe it well.  It's more like eggs with some rice and peppers cooked in.  Still very good, though I'm not big on eggs.\\n-Fried pork chop: The preparation was similar to the wings.  She used a very lean chop, and the same seasoning was sprinkled on top.  This was my favorite part of the meal.\\n-Jambalaya: It was a little juicier than jambalaya that I'm used to, but the same flavors are there.  I took this to-go because I was so stuffed, and it made great leftovers!\\n-Sides: Wow.  I was very impressed!  I get the impression that the sides vary depending on what looks good to Lola in the store.  This is where it's at.  So good!\\n\\nAside from the unexpected egg-y-ness of the breakfast rice, I've got absolutely no complaints with the food.  5 stars all the way!\\n\\nThings to try next:\\n-Friday all-you-can-eat gumbo!  For only $10.  Ohhh...I can eat a LOT of gumbo!\\n-Beignets: They weren't available this time.  I wouldn't have had room anyways.\\n\\nThere seemed to be some confusion at one point about our order.  We had to remind the kid at the front of the restaurant that we'd ordered the jambalaya.  The \\"waiter\\" service wasn't great.  Once we'd ordered there wasn't a lot of communication other than food being brought to our table.  I'm willing to overlook that, though.  Lola was a little short-handed.\\n\\nLola herself is amazing.  I'd love to talk to her more.  She loves to cook.  She compared her love for cooking to the love a mother feels for a newborn child.  She's serious!  The menus advertise the causes close to her heart: \\"Pray for Otis Bell's [her husband's] Freedom [from prison]\\" and \\"Buy a meal for the homeless.\\"\\n\\nI left Lola's feeling very happy to have met her and experienced her cooking.  We spent a lot of time there just savoring the experience.  Don't go there if you're in a rush, and don't get upset if your food takes a while to come.

Since I am an avid yelper, I stole the bar menu as usual.\\n For $1.95 -  spicy wings, cheese burger, crawfish tots, and chips with salsa\\n For $2.95 - hummus, shrimp qesadillas, bean dip and chips, andouille pizza\\n For $3.95 - brandy mushroom burger, shrimp, lamb gyro, red curry mussels\\nHopefully you're not too attached to any of those specials because the list of specials changes all the time but it is also comparable.\\n\\nIf you are hungry then their appetizers are very good deals.   I initially ordered a very tasty lamb gyros complete with nice fresh onions and red tomatoes.   Once I polished that off, the bartender suggested that maybe I should have something else to eat.  I thought that she was crazy but after a bit of thought, I though heck for $1.95 that I might as well get the cheese burger & fries.  They make an excellent burger BTW (I'd recommend skipping the gyros if you go for the cheese burger unless you haven't eaten in a couple of weeks).   She tried to talk me into eating more stuff after that and now I know that she is crazy.   With their very cheap appetizers,  McCormicks-Schmicks' happy hour would be great choice for a big group to share a bunch of cheap appeziters.\\n\\nVery good eats at  McCormicks-Schmicks.  I wish that I had discovered it years ago and I also think that I am going to have to check out the restaurant now."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The charcuterie was so awesome.

Since then we have been fortunate to be remembered by them as they annually send us a big box of Maria's amaretti (macaroons) and assorted biscotti for the Holiday Season.  Their amaretti are truly delicious as the baked exterior is crisp while its center is a bit soft and chewy.  These amaretti are great for shipping as our packages arrive in great shape with few broken or smashed cookies.  I give kudos to whoever it is who packs these goodies because even the biscotti arrive in great shape, too.  \\n\\nAnother Italian specialty that I miss is their fresh made cannoli.  I felt like I lost my \\"heart\\" in Boston after tasting them from Maria's.  Living in Hawaii, we don't have guaranteed overnight shipping especially if refrigeration is involved.  I dare not tempt my taste buds or health to the courier services, nowadays.  That package could very well arrive warm and ruined.  Um, back to the cannoli... The shells are golden brown, crisp yet not hard while holding that luscious subtly flavored ricotta or Mascarpone cheese filling.   I remember making a total pig of myself while gorging several of those crisp tubes of creamy cheese filling.  Ah, I have just my memories to rely on because I haven't found anything as good or fresh like Maria's in Hawaii.  \\n\\nAll of our cookies have \\"mysteriously\\" disappeared since their arrival in early December.  I often wish that I had a nonna or mamma who could make these specialties to fulfill my sweet tooth.   But, I thank my lucky stars for our lovely Bostonian friends.

Upon arriving @ SEA Thai, I have to admit I had low expectations since it's located in a strip mall, but as soon as I entered the building those low expectations, faded very quickly.   The deep blue earthy tones on the walls and the bubbles hanging from the ceiling literally give you feelings of dining under the sea.  The service was very prompt and our server was very friendly.   \\n\\nI started off the meal with an order of Veggie Summer Rolls. The fresh rice paper was a perfect encasing for seared Tofu sticks and the peanut sauce was lusciously thick and creamy.  Next up I had sweet & sour chicken with jasmine rice.  Although the sauce was more sweet than sour, it still had a wonderful flavor; the chicken also had a nice flavor, but needed a little more seasoning.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and the rice was nice and fluffy.  \\n\\nI ended the meal with the Fried Banana with a scoop of Coconut Ice Cream. The ice cream was absolutely fantastic (which I can't believe I thought that, because I am t a fan of coconut), it was rich and creamy, but not too sweet.  It was the perfect finish to a great meal experience."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Very impressed on my first visit.

If I could turn back time I would have went shopping instead. \\n\\nWe were meeting some friends who had just finished the Spartan race for lunch and to kill some time while we waited for our table, we ordered a bottle of Sangria wine and cheese plate. Best part of our dining experience I would have to say! The wine had a nice balance of fruity/sweetness flavors. As for the cheese plate it had a three small blocks made up of Bleu cheese, Swiss, and mozzarella and a spread of pecans and raspberry drizzled with honey. \\n\\nThe weather was perfect - breezy, sunny, not humid - and I love the ambience of the place. People playing bocce ball or hanging out drinking wine or beer - hearing the laughter around you of friends and children - this made up for what they lacked in the food.  \\n\\nOur server, Hannah, was fantastic! She was prompt in getting whatever we needed - drink refills, more jalape√±os, more BBQ. \\n\\nNow for the negatives: I ordered the \\"Thurman's Choice\\" which offers a sampling of their top meats. The lean brisket was dry and no amount of BBQ sauce could make it better. The potato salad was mushy and lacked flavor - it could have  used more salt and substance. The coleslaw was just cabbage with vinegar tossed in it. Out of the meats I liked the sausage the best. The pork ribs were ridiculously small in comparison to other ribs that I have eaten that have the meat falling off the bones. \\n\\nWould I ever drive three hours for their BBQ again?

I've been countless times (avg close to once every 4-6 weeks) since my review and these are the things I've picked up on since then.\\n\\nIn my previous review I compared The Porter to the Brick Store.  While it's certainly a fair comparison, I'll leave that review mostly alone and just focus on The Porter.\\n\\nHere are the reasons you need to go to The Porter:\\n\\n1) You love good food.  The food here is simply outstanding.  I've never had a bad meal and I've tried nearly everything on the menu.  The Porter really does take pub food to another level.  Highlights include the Burger, Arugula side salad, Goat Cheese Fritters, Popcorn, Hush puppies, shrimp and grits, OK so basically the whole menu.\\n\\nRemember when I said I'd leave my previous review mostly alone?  Here is the one thing I'd change.  The Porter has WAY better food than Brick Store.  While the menu is generally on the small side, they have added a weekly specials menu.  What food they do serve, they really knock it out of the park.\\n\\n2) You love good beer.  The selection is wide and varied at competitive prices.  They have a vast selection of Belgium beers (my fav) and US microbrews.  They have maybe 20 or so beers on tap and 75 - 100 in bottles.  I can't think of anyone who would have a hard time finding a beer they liked here.\\n\\n3) You want to support people who are passionate about what they do.  It's clear from the many times I've been to The Porter that Nick and Molly are passionate about their restaurant.  The entire place just works really well and that comes from the owners.\\n\\nPerhaps the only \\"downsides\\"?  Parking can be a bit tough on the weekends.  If you aren't used to urban settings and some of the characters that hang around, you might be a bit surprised if you're coming on the weekends.  I've never had a bad experience with anyone, just realize that someone is likely to ask for money/food.\\n\\nBottom line: When I'm hungry and want some good beer, this is my happy place."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I really enjoyed this spot.  the service was good.   the food was great.

The food is very savory, their Fois Gras appetizer is one of the best I have ever tasted, a specialty, bone marrow butter - where inside of the bone marrow is melted and can be spread on bread is one of their most recommended dishes. We also had the perfectly cooked Swordfish and Sirloin is superb. The pecan pie ice cream - oh my god, so delicious.

I've watched several nearby customers opt for different sauces (which are fine, just not as good as the giacomo's sauce), with disappointing results.

The staff is generally courteous and I've been a faithful customer of theirs.\\n\\nHowever, today (10/3/15), I decided to once again dine at O.B.'s and had severely sub-par service and food. Had the situation been resolved internally at the restaurant, I would not feel compelled to present this publicly. However, the staff at O.B.'s Cafe did not show me this courtesy as is standard with customer service, and thus I feel obligated to bring forth this situation.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Eggs 'n' Hash and French Toast with Strawberries (with whipped cream). The eggs and hash were phenomenal as usual. But to our dismay, a number of strawberries on the french toast dish were found to be moldy after we uncovered them from the whipped cream that was very excessively topped (perhaps strategically) thus masking the evidently moldy strawberries.\\n\\nBeing conscious of not wanting to waste food, I carefully ate around the moldy strawberries with the plan to note it to the staff following our meal. When the waitress came to collect our plates, we explained the situation to her, and she paid minimal attention to it. While waiting for the check, we assumed that the staff would have the courtesy to apologize for serving food of inedible quality, instead, we were presented with the check without any acknowledgement of the situation.\\n\\nInfuriated, we left paying just half of the bill, feeling justified that as customers, we should be revered with respect and have our concerns acknowledged by the institution.\\n\\nUpon leaving, another waitress chased us down from the restaurant exclaiming that we had not paid the entire bill. When we explained the moldy strawberries to her, she adamantly stated that no such thing had occurred and moldy strawberries were not served. After some time, the waitress that had been attending to us came out and we settled the situation.\\n\\nShe stated that had her boss been present, she could have brought the issue to his/her attention and everything would have been resolved. Instead, we, as customers, were treated as if we were in the wrong. I did not ask to have moldy strawberries served to me, and never, as a customer, should I leave your business feeling as if I was the one at fault.\\n\\nI do not expect to return to O.B.'s Cafe again as their treatment of me today does not deserve my patronage."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had an OK experience at Row 34.

Luckily, we were soon seated and greeted by the server who took our drink order (just coffee) and returned with water but then didn't return with the coffee for about 5 minutes. Our actual food order was also slow to be taken and I spotted another couple who were sat after us had their food orders taken by another server.\\n\\nThe waiting aside, the food is delicious. I particularly liked their vegetarian options and ordered Dana's Tempeh Skillet. Alas, the server didn't mention they were out of tempeh so got the vegetarian sausage substitute which was fine. The side order of buttermilk pancakes was soft and fluffy and a great sweet addition after the savory. The Breakfast Burrito order from my companion looked generously portioned but I was enjoying my plate too much to sample any.\\n\\nOverall, the food made the wait worthwhile.

Tables six and over can call for reservations.  The place is often very crowded.  \\nIt's hard to tell if this place was going for a high-end look and failed (cheap tables that wobble, stained table runners, fake candles, etc.), or if it's just comfortably in that gray area.\\n\\nThe smoothies aren't worth their cost - except the ones with cashew inside of them.  The cashews add such a creamy texture which is expensive to create at home.  There's one called \\"Bunny Spice\\" - give it a spin!\\n\\nThe vegan chik'n has a great texture, but not much flavour.  The salads tend to have a lot of salad stalks in them, which makes them not-so-great; however, if you haven't had a non-dairy caesar yet, here's your chance!  It tastes the same; (that is, just as plain.)  If you do get a salad, pay extra to have something added on top (like chik'n).\\n\\nThe ginger miso soup is an experimental dish that didn't do so well, at least not in my opinion.  I love miso soups, but not this one.  The miso had an odd flavour, I'm pretty sure the tofu was extra-firm non-silken (in miso - what?), and the ginger just didn't mix well.\\nThe \\"Red Lentil\\" signature soup was unimpressive, though the whole black peppers added a nice spice.  \\n\\nI have had two dishes from this restaurant - \\"Seitan Crepes\\" and \\"Gobi Manchura.\\"  \\nThe Crepes were absolutely flavourless, and a little gross, BUT the seitan inside was delicious with perfect texture, and the fruit that garnished it made a wonderful complement.\\nIt made me a bit nervous to try any other experimental dishes though, because of how delicious the non-experimental dish (Gobi) was.  \\nIt was perfect - make sure it's not the first dish you try there, or you'll never get anything else.\\n\\nAll of their cakes are vegan, and you could never tell them from non-vegan deserts.  They always have one gluten-free option, and it is similarly to die for.  Unless you can inhale desserts, I advise splitting one with a dining-mate because they are all so rich in flavour.\\n\\nThe weekend brunch is amazing, everything is delicious and beautiful.  Get there early as it fill up very fast.

So off to Lake O, near 365, the waterfront and railroad, we went. The atmosphere is casual and a bit more upscale than your average pizza place. The staff are friendly and laid back and it's ambient music isn't too loud that you can't have a conversation, but isn't so quiet that you can hear everyone else. \\n\\nIt took a decent amount of time for our server to arrive and to get water and drinks. So that wasn't the greatest start. Then when we went to order our vegan pizza, we were told that they were all out of the Follow Your Heart mozzarella, but they could replace it with cauliflower puree, which was a nice, creamy substitute. I wasn't excited about the prospect, but it was the only option so that's what we did.\\n\\nThe pizza itself is really expensive. I mean $17 for a 7-8\\" pizza? I can get a LOADED pizza that's about the same size from Mod for $8. As you can see from the photos, the toppings are scant. I HATE, and I cannot exaggerate how much I hate, celery. I don't know what it is but it has a strong smell and flavor to me and I hate it. So I had to take it off of my half of the Buffalo pizza. When I took off the celery there was hardly anything left. When I brought it up to the server, she said it is Neopolitan style, which means they do very light toppings to ensure they don't soak the crust and ruin the pizza. (I actually had a 3 star review ready based on that information, until I verified with Wikipedia) Hmmmm...\\n\\nApparently that's totally not right as Wikipedia says:\\nNeapolitan pizza (Italian: pizza napoletana) is a style of pizza made with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. It must be made with San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, a protected designation of origin cheese made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state.[1] Neapolitan pizza is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) product in Europe, the art of its making is included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[2] This style pizza gave rise to the New York-style pizza that was first made by Italian immigrants to the United States in the early 20th century.[3]\\n\\nSo no. They're just being cheap with the toppings. The pizza tasted nice but you're getting more crust than anything. For $15-17 buy a crust and eat it if you want that. The $$ just simply isn't worth while. \\n\\nThe house \\"cocktails\\" are pre-bottled, so they don't have to worry about a bartender, but they too are overpriced. I know it's Lake O, but dang people look at other nearby businesses and price accordingly. \\n\\nAll in all, decent pizza, beautiful set up, okay drinks but way overpriced. We won't be back again. I suggest vegans take your pizza cravings elsewhere."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great food (I grew up in Florida and love Cuban food), tons of options and pages of drinks, but as some others have said, snobby and just rude service.

All other bars in the vicinity were either packed or did not have a TV. We tried our luck at Daedalus and were pleasantly surprised by the numbers of TVs and available seating. \\n\\nMy group was seated on the second floor, where we had a booth and a TV all to ourselves. We weren't allowed to turn the volume on, which wasn't too bad. That's what subtitles are for, right?\\n\\nWe had to have some appetizers and drinks for game day. The drinks were average at best. They were either hits or misses. I enjoyed my Moscow Mule - vodka, ginger beer, lime juice, and garnished with a slice of lime. It came in a cool bronze cup. There was a refreshing taste to it and it had just the right amount of kick. The Hendrick's was interesting. It was a gin and tonic but not in a cocktail form. I was presented with glass full of gin and a bottle of tonic. I wasn't clear on how to drink it... Was I supposed to chug the gin and chase it down with a few sips of the tonic? A word of instruction would've been helpful. \\n\\nWe also got a couple of orders of buffalo wings and truffle fries. Note: meager serving sizes. 3 pieces of wings and a few celery/carrot sticks came with each order. The wings were swimming in a pool of buffalo sauce, which made the first bite extremely pungent. I would pass on the wings next time. The truffle fries were okay. They were on the soft and chunky side. They tasted pretty delicious while we were buzzed.\\n\\nBesides the lack of quality in the food, the service was also subpar. Our waitress was unsympathetic and uninterested the whole night. When we asked for water, she only brought us one glass. We wanted to order more food because the portions were small, only to be informed that the kitchen had already closed. It was only around 11 pm. Regardless, we would have really appreciate a last call!\\n\\nOverall Daedalus is a just another option if you need a place to chill around Harvard Square.

They were all good but I ended up using the Kinda Hot the most. My friend got the sweet potato fingers/fries and didn't like them, but I did! They were really crisp and flavorful, and reminded me a little bit of fried plantains. Overall, I was more than satisfied with the experience. My one gripe with this place is the atmosphere...it's so modern and sterile. I live in Boston for a reason - I like that slightly dingy, aged/weathered, cozy-to-cramped feeling wherever I go, and Estelle's definitely does not have that.

Our waitress, Patricia, (attentive and fun server by the way!) told us that Yelp was just in here this past Saturday, as the place was crowded for the Easter weekend-in the restaurant and for pre-orders for Easter food-as they were filming this place for Yelp's website. If you are Polish (and even if you are not), it you want to taste \\"Mom's Polish Food\\", this IS THE PLACE! I cannot remember the last time I had Polish food this good (maybe in my hometown of South Bend, IN many years back). I had the Polish Sampler and the Stuffed Cabbage (golabki) and the Kielbasa (fresh sausage) were excellent. The pierogi were appetizer size, stuffed with potato and cheese, and topped with caramelized onions. They have a pretty good variety of Polish beers (I had the Zywiec and the Perla).  Try the Chicken Dill Pickle soup, a favorite of the loyal customers. Even though it sounds odd (like the menu states), it is great! \\"Cieszyc sie jedzeniem\\" - \\"Enjoy the food!\\""},{"name":"MADdogs Gourmet Hot Dogs","address":"1900 NE 162nd Ave, Ste D114","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I'm not a fan of hot dogs, so didn't expect to like this place. To my surprise, I LOVE it. Lots of unique options to personalize the hot dog, but what's most special is the hot dog itself. This is not your typical grocery store hot dog. The seasoning, the texture, the \\"snap\\" when you bite into it. Service is always super friendly and fast. The price point may be a little high, in my opinion, but not overly so.

He got the salmon burger (which constantly fell apart; it was not entirely a burger, it was more like a mash of salmon, herbs, and vegetables), the order of buffalo tenders (which were very good and flavorful), and she got the baja chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries (which were extremely satisfying and delicious) and these three items cost about $40, so a little pricey for lunch.\\n- Service was fine, nothing exceptional; have to cut the waiter some slack because there WERE a lot of people in the cafe at the time (1 pm, Saturday, lunch time for most)\\n- We had to wait ~20 minutes to be seated, but we were able to enjoy the very large book selection in the store. Many books were on sale, and in top condition.\\n- Bathrooms are basically holes in the store; no mirrors in the womens bathroom, but a large one in the mens?

With every purchase, you get a gift card that basically says inside that you gave a gift of food to the homeless in whomever's name you choose.

I'm not a huge pizza fan because of the standard American way it's prepared but my dear god Antico makes a tasty pizza.

Expect huge chunks of meat, chunks of fresh cheeses and hugely visible veggies all fresh, and all prepared to order. \\n\\nSo the pizza is orgasmic...but I gave them three stars.  Why?  It's obvious that the staff knows they make a damn good pizza and they are snotty and stuck up for it.  After drinking his baby Coke which where horribly over priced my husband asked at the counter how he would get water.  The girl, whom I think was faking and accent, looked at him like he was stupid, pointed at a little row of plastic cups and said \\"There are cups and the spigot is over there\\" with a very dismissing hand motion.  It was like the bad chef that gets upset when someone asks for ketchup to put on his food....her attitude was how dare you drink a beverage with your pizza.  \\n\\nAll in all go....grab it to go and either eat it in the parking lot or head to a park and have a picnic, you'll have a five star experience, but dealing with staff for more than order and pickup, you'll be lucky if you have a three star day."},{"name":"Polonia","address":"750 S US Hwy 17-92","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Had breakfast there yesterday.

If you eat between 7-8am they offer a 2 for 1 on their breakfast entrees. I just had breakfast with a friend which included french toast (not very Cuban but still very good), the Cuban continental (full basket of yummy pastries and mocha), plus a latte and a side of tropical fruit for $10. Yes, that's right. Plus, the restaurant is pretty much empty on a week-day morning at 7am. Making it a great place to have a quiet conversation with a friend over food. \\n\\nAtmosphere: They score lots of points here as well. It's like walking into another world when you dine here. The walls are brightly painted and the decor helps you imagine that rather than suffering through another rainy PDX day, you might just be on a Caribbean island. \\n\\nCatering: I used Pambiche for an office event where I wanted to feed between 30-45 people. After hunting all over town for some place that wouldn't require me to drop $500 on a minimum order, I landed here.

Sure, a bad day here and there, but seriously the staff needs to get over themselves and management needs to provide some training. There is no sense of customer service at any point in the transaction.  Although we live within a few steps of this Farnsworth location, we avoid unless there is no other alternative.  We found ourselves in that position yesterday.  Even though the place was EMPTY, the complication in ordering, asking for a bag as we were taking pastries to friends, being tossed a plastic bag similar to what you put veggies in at stop in shop, having to discuss that if we wanted a bag with handles that's all they had... a bag without handles however would be more stable and appropriate... and on and on and nonsense.

I used to live in the neighborhood and it became my regular takeout spot when I didn't feel like cooking.  Basically it's the perfect combo of cheap, flavorful, and consistently satisfying.  It's so small that the tables are intimately close and people are always getting hit by the front door. (they really should reverse the hinges so it can open outward.) I don't do anything on the chinese menu and stay away from some of the appetizers, but the thai rice and noodle dishes hit the spot every single time.  Every time I take someone there, they are super pleased with this somewhat hidden gem. Service is good and the owner/staff will remember your face when you return.  This is a spot that's all about the food: the decor is tacky and they serve you canned soda with a glass and a straw. But don't be alarmed, your stomach will be happy when you get your small bill with orange slices. It'd get five stars if there was ambience, a better drink selection/full bar, and more dessert options.

The decor is really pleasant, the playlist is FANTASTIC (public service announcement, we asked and apparently it's Foster the People with Rihanna Pandora Radio), and the menu is just really well done.\\n\\nI definitely recommend making your own charcuterie board -- none of the choices are going to be bad, and it's just so much fun to pick between the cheeses and meats and the little extras. We tried the shallot marmalade, which I'd highly recommend. The house pickles and mustard, and the local bread that came with it were all perfect and made it much more filling than it may initially seem. I'd also like to add that they serve it to make it look big, instead of emphasizing the smallness of the portions. I appreciated that.\\n\\nMy mother got the pea greens salad, which I thought was a throwaway, but again -- WOW. I don't usually try restaurant salads and want to replicate them, but this one was truly incredible -- it had mint leaves, prosciutto, some kind of cheese, and a delicious lemony dressing that made it taste almost Mediterranean, and the flavors were balanced so that the mint wasn't overwhelming. I'd go back to try that salad.\\n\\nMy dad and I ordered the Salty Pig Pizza -- also great. The caramel does a nice job adding sweetness, and I really liked the arugula piled on top of the pizza, turning it into a kind of half salad.\\n\\nIf the drinks had been a dollar cheaper overall (though there were some beers at $6, I'd like to see fewer at $8 and $10), I'd give this place a five I think. The food was really great, and also good value, the service was attentive and kind and not at all snooty, and I would bring someone back here for really anything.

After our drink order he came back to take our food order. We ordered our appetizer and meal at the same time since we knew what wanted and figured we would save some time.  We sat and enjoyed a few drinks for over a half hour and still no appetizer came out. After about forty minutes a food runner came over and placed our entrees in front of us.  At this point I was hungry so we just decided to go ahead and eat our entrees and forget the appetizer. The waiter gave us dessert on the house when I pointed out that we never got our appetizer which was nice. Overall the food was just average. I knew it was going to be pricey so I'm not going to complain about that but I feel like I could have gotten the same thing maybe better at Bertucis.

I'm always skeptical to try out teriyaki sauces, since every freakin' Japanese restaurant make theirs sauces completely opposite from one another. it's hard to find similar sauces, but the teriyaki sauce at nakato is actually one of the best ones I've had. the sauce wasn't too salty or strong in soy sauce, which was great. the beef was cooked to a nice medium rare, which made the meat tender and NOT tough & chewy. \\n\\n+ \\"DRAGON ROLL\\"\\ninside: amaebi (sweet shrimp) tempura and avocado; outside: eel, avocado, and topped w/ a spicy aioli and unagi (eel) sauce\\n\\nthis is usually my go-to roll at any Japanese restaurant. it's habitual for me, so I always HAVE to order it. this roll was good, but it wasn't the BEST I've had. we had 3 sushi rolls in total, but this was the only roll that we had to order twice. things I look for when it comes to sushi is if it taste and smells fresh. also, the avocado has to be of a nice green color as well; no brown for me please. nakato passed the test.   \\n\\nall the other dishes were decent; nothing too special.

The burger did taste good, but the bed of leafy greens had mold on one leaf. Read white spores popping up in the nooks and crannies of the radicchio. I actually mentioned it to the 2nd waiter. He said he would talk to the chef....well he never came back. No sorry, no free dessert or, removal from the bill. We did the burger, but I wouldn't order it again. It was just a burger on four pieces of lettuce with a side of pickled radish oh and 1,000 island sauce ($13). While the buttered pasta ($8) is being consumed and seems to be delightful.

We finally asked what's up and he said that the runner 'forgot' it. Really? Isn't that your job as a server to check up with the runner and that your customers are taking care of? I used to serve myself.\\nIt's not like he was very busy or something to excuse this.\\nDidn't really follow up with us and we had to call him over several times to get service, extra napkins, etc. \\n Also there was a family across from us with two small kids who were standing on the furniture an climbing on the decorative the walls.\\nThese parents didn't do anything- unfortunately this is so common nowadays.

Nice. Not bad, not knock your socks off great. When ever I come here it is with my best girl friend and we end up browsing the books, picking out a few that have to do with some European country that she is going to be visiting in the next few months, then sitting in the cafe and talking about our love lives over huge cups of coffee. It is straight out of a romantic comedy or an hour long prime-time soap on the CW. That being said, I know for a fact that 83% of the women from 18-35 demographic desires to have moments like the ones portrayed in those CW soaps at least twice a year. That is what this place was made for. You can also sit by the window with your laptop and work on your thesis, while the foot traffic of Newbury street carries on outside. You never have to worry about the staff, they have been ... I am trying to think of a good adjective for them... I guess perfect, and yes I know that that is a bit lofty. But they are always there when you need them, they have the answer to whether or not the shrimp and corn stew was made with chicken stock or not (and no, it was made with white bean puree if you where wondering), and they have never hustled us out of a table even when it is clear that we had finished our meal about 45 minutes ago. And I know what you are thinking, that they hate us for all the things listed, but I like to think that they can not hate someone who tips them a minimum of 25% whenever they eat there. \\n\\nThe book selection if pretty good, it is kind of a tiny place so they can not have everything, but like I said it is pretty (darn) good. What is great, and garnered half a star by itself is the periodicals section. If you are looking for a magazine I will guarantee that they have it here, and you might as well pick up that really funny postcard to send to your Aunt, the cool one that has no kids, because you will not find it anywhere else. \\n\\nSo I recommend it, not for an everyday place unless you want to be 'that' person; but definitely go every two or three months. \\n\\nP.S.

It lived up to very lofty expectations.\\n\\nMy buddy and I went on a Tuesday for lunch during a tour of hill country bbq legends. Overall the grounds are quite impressive: several buildings including the restaurant, banquet halls, vineyards, and a wine tasting cottage. You know this place is serious based on the capacity of the parking lot. It's like an NFL stadium.\\n\\nWe got there around 12:30 and were seated immediately, with plenty of available tables. Walking in and seeing the open pit was a thing of beauty. More on that later. \\n\\nI ordered the  4-meat sampler with brisket, ribs, sausage, and turkey. Under normal circumstances, I'd have gotten the all-you-can-eat. But as this trip was an all out war on my stomach, I showed restraint. \\n\\nBrisket - ordered it \\"burnt\\". A tough call vs. Franklin, but my favorite brisket in TX. It's like meat candy. I could not recommend it more. If you're afraid to order burnt (vs. fatty or lean), just ask them to put some burnt on there. Unreal. \\n\\nRibs - good to very good. Salt Lick's tangy sauce (no tomato) works great on these.\\n\\nSausage - fair to good. Not great by hill country standards. I prefer a drier sausage and they sop the otherwise delicious sauce on there. \\n\\nTurkey - the surprise of the meal. My buddy made funny of me for ordering it (he ordered 4-meat with double brisket). The joke was on him. The gets a great smoke and goes extremely well with the sauce.\\n\\nI could care less about sides at BBQ joints. They were nothing to write home about.\\n\\nIn NYC it would've been $30+ for the equivalent portion. This was like  $14.99.\\n\\nOn our way out, we  go over to take some photos of the pit. A young guy named Matt came up and started chatting with us. Turns out he manages all personnel, is the official \\"brisket taster\\", and does business analytics for the owner. He could not have been more friendly. He talked to us for ~45 minutes about the restaurant, the overall enterprise, their cooking and smoking methods, and answered every question we had. \\n\\nWe left the restaurant and went over to the wine cottage. They offer a tasting of 5 wines for $5. I'd never had Texas wine before and was pleasantly surprised. Some are Salt Lick's wines. Others are family wineries from around the state.

It's in Cambridge, about a 10 minute walk from Harvard square.  We were a little bemused as our directions were taking us into a very residential area but a large sign outside assured us we were in the right place.  It's in the basement of a residential building, and is just the most adorable quirky space I've seen in a long time.\\n\\nWe settled in first at the small bar, one friend had a glass of orange wine (yes, it's a thing) and the other had a cocktail off their very creative menu.  I opted for the foraged and found; basically you describe what you want and they create it for you.  I saw a lot of interesting artisanal bottles behind the bar, so I went for it.  It was quite a concoction, gin-based and herbaceous, almost like a savoury version of a Pimms cup.  I liked it, but it was so stiff I was tipsy before dinner started!  \\n\\nFor a starter, I had the pickled veg, which were a little hit and miss, pickled ramps were awesome, what I think were pickled cranberries, not so much.  My friend had the radishes with creme fraiche, an interesting dish with really fresh quality ingredients but maybe lacking a little punch.  My main was the poppy seed encrusted cod, a really unique flavour that took a little getting used to but was really unique and delicious.  My friend had the steak and frites, apparently it was amazing, but I wouldn't know, it was so good he refused to share!  We split a really nice cheese plate for dessert and we were pleasantly but not uncomfortably stuffed by the end of the meal.\\n\\nThe service was top notch, friendly, personable and attentive.  This place is clearly a labour of love for the people who work here. \\n\\nOverall I'd give the food 4 stars, it was very adventuresome and a few things were a little odd, but props to them for creativity and taking risks.

Spoiler alert: If it were based solely on the performance of the chef, this place would get 1 star or less. The interior of the restaurant is very much like any other hibachi restaurant you would go to - hibachi on one side, sushi bar on another, and general seated serve. The first thing I disliked was that the waiter brought out the soup, then went back to the kitchen and brought back the salad instantly. I like some time in between so a) I don't feel rushed, and b) my salad won't become soggy as I have my soup, or my soup won't become cold as I eat my salad.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, people go to hibachi restaurants to be entertained. I would've been more entertained watching water evaporate from a cup. In several instances I completely forgot we were even at a hibachi restaurant. And when the chef did speak, I couldn't understand a word he was saying. And after a while, I didn't even care anymore. I'm sure many of you know the feeling of looking over at another more entertaining table and wishing you were seated over there instead, right? Well I wasn't even afforded that opportunity to dream a little. The highlight of my night was watching these three rookies try to do a sake bomb and fail epically. I seriously felt embarrassed for them. \\n\\nI think you get the picture of how my night went. But just as an icing on the cake, I thought the night couldn't get any worse but man was I wrong. They have THE worst ventilation system I have ever seen. I was truly amazed. It was as if all the vents were smoke generators or fog machines. There was more smoke in that room than a smoking room in an airport with no ventilation. If there were a fire, the building would certainly burn down because there's no way a smoke detector could distinguish between a fire and a normal night here. \\n\\nAnd finally, as I departed and the valet grabbed my car, I look over to my left and see that my car was parked no more than 30 yards away from where I stood. Seriously?! They need a valet for that?? I still felt obligated to tip the valet, but it would've been 10 times faster (and 10 times healthier) just getting it myself rather than waiting in line and breathing in the oh-so-wonderful second hand smoke, as if I didn't get enough already.

There was a line out the door and it took over 20 minutes to get seated.  They sat people who got their later (like 10 minutes later)  in front of us which- but I guess there are more tables for parties of 2 than anything else.  Once we were seated we were asked to change tables as they wanted to seat a larger party at the table we had given us.  We were fine with that even though it was kind of a nuisance because we had just put all our stuff down, got my daughter a booster seat, etc...  After, we were seated at a corner table, we were approached yet again a 3rd time asking for our extra chair.  I replied it was fine, but could we please get some coffee?  By the time our waitress came and asked what we wanted to drink we were ready to place our entire order.  To the diner's credit, both coffee (pretty standard diner coffee) and breakfast did come out quickly.  I ordered a special called the cheesy chicken omelet.  It was cooked perfectly with scallions, bacon, tomato, and cheddar cheese- it was pretty good, nice combo of flavors but nothing I'll remember in a couple of days.  It came with marble toast and home fries both were good, but I could have ordered those anywhere and they would have been the same quality.  My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich that came with sausage. Egg, cheese, and bbq sauce in a wrap..  Again, it was nice but pretty run on the mill.  We got my little girl the caramel crunch French toast.  This was the shining light on the menu-  it was nothing like I thought it would (globs of caramel over regular French toast)..  It was decadent, but not over the top sweet or rich.  The French toast had a nice crunch to it and the caramel was very light- it came with whip cream- no syrup needed and it was excellent.  My two year old ate most of it on her own.  So, to wrap it up- if you are ok with waiting awhile on a Saturday morning for a standard, good quality, nice portion size breakfast- then this is a good place to go, but certainly not worth more than a 10 minute drive- you will be able to find something just as good at a closer location to wherever you live."},{"name":"Sweetish Hill Bakery","address":"1120 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Cute bakery on West Sixth with many pastries, sandwiches, and coffee!

I think this was probably an honest mistake as we saw numerous parties seated and served before a server even visited our table, but if it was an aberration it was a disappointing one.  (2) I ordered pancakes with chocolate chips and got pancakes with blueberries.  (3) Tables were very cramped (it was a Saturday morning) and I could hear every conversation from the tables on either side.  If they could make the economics work, getting rid of like 6 tables might do them very well.  (4) Waited another 15 minutes after we were done eating to get the bill.

Being spoiled by the food scene in NYC we wanted to dine at a comparable place and we found something better at Row 34.\\n\\nEmily & I walk in and are greeted by a large raw bar display (always a plus) and take a seat at the bar, and are greeted by Andrew, our bartender for the evening who we'd both basically fall in love with before evening's end.\\n\\nI'm a firm believer in paying for good food, but good food is more than just execution of a dish, it involves the company, the service, and the ambiance. Row 34 was serving all of that. Lord knows you don't get that kind of service in New York unless you're paying $180 for the Chateaubriand at Keen's Steakhouse. I'm regularly met with aloof & grumpy bartenders who seem like they just deign even being alive. Food to me is about the experience; some people pay $175 for concert tickets, I put that down for food.\\n\\nEmily & I shoveled basically every appetizer available down our mouth holes, gorging and fangirling about how good each dish was. We ordered the fried oysters, grilled corn, tuna tartare, and fries to start. The dishes were bomb dot com. They were on par with New York's dining scene (I say this as someone who has a well-heeled friend who's taken me out to some of the best-in-class restaurants when he flies into town every other month). I could eat there everyday, it was one of those restaurants. \\n\\nThen Emily & I began talking about what we should order for dessert because nothing feels great like being bloated on decadent foods. There were 3 things on the menu: a chocolate item, a strawberry shortcake, and a butterscotch. So while Emily and I were toiling away at whether we should get one or both (she doesn't like chocolate; barbarian, I know), Andrew had overheard us and decided to put in an order for both and comp one. To put a cherry on top of that, he had remembered earlier that I was asking about their selection of sours & stouts (ended up drinking a cava the whole night with my meal), and he paired the desserts with a stout & a sour for me.\\n\\nI don't know if I was taken aback by his charm, or him just being an incredibly knowledgeable and attentive but I was having all of it. He was hitting all the right buttons when I asked about digestifs and he started talking about an Oloroso. They're just something carnal and sexy about a tatted up scruffy bartender talking to you about sherries. There have only been a handful of times in my life I've experience a bartender being proactive with my drinks and each time it's appreciated. I don't care if you serve me a shit drink too. The fact that you took the time to think about what I might like says it all. But guys, this place is has no Michelin star with a $225 tasting menu... no, it's casual industrial chic that serves great unpretentious food. \\n\\nI walked away in love with the place (and in love with Andrew... to the point we were debating closing down the restaurant to kick it with him. \\"Emily, come on... let's just stay.\\" \\"Peter, they don't close for like another hour and sessions start early.\\"), Our drunk asses didn't even realize until we were sitting in the cab that our bill should've been about 25% more than what we were actually billed. \\n\\nThat was our Tuesday night, and I would eat there again on Thursday after a miserable dining experience at The Merchant (my first time ever having to send back a dish). Thursday night rolls around and I'm left to my own devices, abandoned by my colleagues and in a post-Amy Schumer haze stumble hungry into Row 34. Thank god, there's one seat open and I plop my derriere down next to this woman who I would so on discover is also from NYC, a Director at A&E Networks and was also at the conference. \\n\\nI'm not in the section of the bar where Andrew is serving to my dismay, but he remembers me and comes on over and introduces himself. This point, the woman next to me, and I are exchanging stories about our dating lives and a chunk of time passes and I keep forgetting to order my food as I make a new BFF. I finally go to order my food after 30 minutes but no, no, no, Andrew had already taken it upon himself to order me the Tuna Tartare (and he motherfuckin' comps it). At this point, Jen and I are basically besties and she's diving into my tartare and she ends up ordering more oysters and stays longer when she was wrapping up just as I arrived. \\n\\nThat night I ended up tasting the other half of the menu that I didn't get to shovel into my mouth - the mussels, onion rings, and lobster roll. If it wasn't so de rigueur, I would've brought the bowl of mussels up to my mouth and drank every last drop of the delicious broth it was steamed in.

It had lots of sour taste with a side of bitter.  Drenched in soy sauce from the dipping plate and it was edible.  \\n\\nOrder chasing dragon roll and it was kind of soggy.  Got 4 salmon nigiri and 1 scallop nigiri.  Salmon was good, the scallop not so much.  It had some bitter taste (it was an upgrade to have that topping by the way).\\n\\n2 adults and 3 kids (7 and under) $100 and left hungry and less than satisfied. This can't be the best sushi, it's impossible.  It's pretty average and I find it very annoying they charge Maguro prices for Albacore.

For the sides the corn is a must and they tend to have different flavored rice which is also fresh (unlike other places where I feel they just warmed up frozen rice). Overall Acitron is one of my favorite restaurants in Arlington for dinner. \\n\\nHaving said that I wouldn't recommend going here for the brunch.

We got a pitcher of red sangria. This is where Rocco's loses a star. It was cloyingly sweet, barely alcoholic, and we only got about 3 glasses out of it, so while it was an *okay* deal for the price, I don't really feel like it was worth it. We got a pitcher of jalapeno margaritas which were the freaking bomb! I was a little scared of the \\"jalapeno\\" part but they just had this wonderful jalapeno flavor with very little of the heat. Quite drinkable, totally delicious, and I think we got about 5 glasses out of the pitcher, so it def felt like a great value. We also got mojitos, which were... yknow, it's a mojito. If you mess that up, you should probably not be in the drink making business. They were fresh and tasty and a fair value. \\n\\nAppetizers: the guacamole, obviously, is a popular choice. I don't even like guac, but it was so fresh and had such great texture that I enjoyed it. The chips! I don't know what is in that seasoning- chili powder and fairy magic?- it is AMAZING! We got the Tres Amigos salsas. The red one is crazy spicy but was popular among those at the table who are into that sort of thing. The green salsa was wonderful, just a little heat and a bit tangy like lime or vinegar. The real star though was the Salsa de Cacahuate. I had never heard of it before but I was intrigued. It's sort of reminiscent of thai peanut sauce, I guess? It's amazing and I could eat it every day and as there is no Rocco's near me, I will be scouring the internet for a suitable substitute. \\n\\nEntrees: I honestly don't remember what we all ordered, but it was all delicious and we were all very happy with our choices, and I'd happily return next time we are in the vicinity."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"My wife had the gnocchi.

While the menu selection was certainly innovative and the kitchen staff talented, we weren't blown away by the food. In all fairness that was our opinion of the offerings, and everyone's palate and tastes are different. So I would recommend that you at least try it because so many people do seem to enjoy it. \\nOur biggest issue was with the service. We found our primary server to be condescending and unaccommodating. She answered the majority of our questions with a yes or no, no elaboration or explanation. For example 2/4 of us wanted to order the tasting menu. Her response to our order was, \\"no, the whole table has to order the tasting menu\\". And then she just looked at us. That was it. It was so uncomfortable. She didn't offer an alternative or maybe offer an explanation. This \\"rule\\" was not on menu. So was it even true? We would ask her, \\"can we do/have .....\\", her answer, \\"No\\". And everything was \\"super delicious\\". Could she have offered additional information? Yes. Did she? No. A restaurant of this level should have a staff that can offer why the plates are \\"super delicious\\" and willing to at least entertain your requests. Truthfully, it was almost as though we were being treated as though we were too stupid to understand so it was easier for her to just say as little as possible. Overall, I felt as though she was treating us as if we should have been grateful to have the privilege of dining there. It was truly obnoxious.  However, the server who offered us dessert was lovely. She smiled, was lively and bright and engaged us. She certainly made up for the other's lack of personality. \\nNow here is why we ALL had a problem with that type of treatment, we spent over $500 on dinner. That is a premium to spend on dinner in Boston, and the staff, all of them, have an obligation to put their best foot forward and accommodate the patrons with a willingness to at least TRY and placate them.

It was hard and stale tasting. I couldn't even eat it. Huge bummer! Not sure if it just wasn't for me, or if we got a bad batch, but my non picky boyfriend agreed it tasted stale and dry.

I did like the chia seed jam, and the a√ßa√≠ itself was pretty good. The real bummer of it was the granola. It was soft and stale, not crunchy or crisp. Kind of ruined it for me as granola is my fav part. \\n\\nThe last thing we got was the chaga mushroom coffee shake. The best part of this was the coconut cream topping.

It was just as expensive as the regular menu. \\n\\nI feel like their menu needs a total overhaul. Its WAY overpriced and too fancy for what this place should be.  I'd rather just have standard bar food, especially since none of their fancy \\"small plates\\" (which are like $8-10 a piece!) or entrees and sandwiches are that good.\\n\\nThe place is also dirty.

We ordered tandoori chicken, chicken biryani, naan, achaari paneer and a gulab jamun desert. The place was pretty full but it took quite a while for our food to come out. They brought out a little foie gras for everyone which I think was to make up for the wait. \\nWhen the food did arrive, it was excellent. Flavorful and authentic. The paneer was the shining star of the meal, though. It was delicious! The gulab jamun was also really good. The portions are on the smaller side but for me personally this wasn't a problem. \\n\\nNow the service was a little spotty. The staff was very friendly but they missed out on little things that one expects from the Taj.

Normally I think its over-sauced to cover up how terribly it is cooked. However, my mission on my two week business trip to Austin was to try the highest rated and most recommended food in the area and this was on the list. I was skeptical heading here, but I was more than willing to try what I heard was the best place to eat BBQ in Austin, although this was a little far out of the way from the city. Driving there we were all extremely confused as we passed a Hindu temple, a couple of mansions, and a whole bunch of nothing most of the time. Don't worry, you are heading the right way. Trust your iOS device!! However, when we saw about 200 cars in the near distance, we realized we were in for a trip of greatness. \\n\\nThe concept was definitely something I didn't experience in my life being from California. The ambiance was awesome. I liked the relaxed vibe with the BYOB, the picnic tables, and the band playing. It gave me the complete Texas experience on my last night of my two week stay. Just an FYI... WARNING: CASH ONLY!!! We didn't know this and we all brought credit cards which was quite difficult and required a lot of phone calls and expensive cash advances but it was worth it.\\n\\nWe purchased 3 six packs of Shiner Bock previous to sitting down and prepared ourselves for a lot of meat. Meat is the national sign that you are in Texas in my opinion. The brisket was absolutely amazing. The ribs had a fantastic sweet glaze on them and truly melted in my mouth. I never eat ribs but I would eat these every day quite possibly. They are that good. i also tried the Turkey which was good, but not a stand out compared to the other meat options. The potato salad was unique and not what I'm used to but tasty. The slaw was different as well and I enjoyed it. it seemed to have a vinegar based dressing with some salt and pepper. It was simple and delicious. It was a fantastic meal.\\n\\nWe finished with what our server recommended: Blackberry cobbler. WOW. it was extremely delicious. It was the perfect consistency. The berries were plump and juicy and the crust/cake on top was so delicious and made just the right way. It is a must try and the perfect way to end your meal. \\n\\nIf you are in Texas, make the drive here.

I had came back to visit TX and this place was on my bucket-list of places to go when I got back and I was very happy!!! This place has fresh lemonade that you can get for $2.50 a cup while you wait to be seated inside the restaurant. The outside seating area included wood tables under tall trees which gave you shade, but had the perfect nature-feel and look. There is even a small mini-stage where they play live music with a small speaker. The wait only took about 20-30 minutes. In the meantime, there is a vineyard out back that you can go check out and a small store with the different wines they have for sale, plus some other knick-knacks for wine like wine holders, cork holders, and coasters. There is even a small stone grill with an outside bar on the patio. \\n\\nThey sell t-shirts, caps, BBQ sauces and other franchise merchandise before you walk into the restaurant. As soon as you walk in, you can see the big grill with all the different meat varieties: brisket, pork, chicken, turkey, sausages...etc. Plus, you walk past the pecan pies which look so delicious... The tables are all made of wood and are great for big group parties. The food sizes are hugeee... We got some sampler plate that had ribs, sausage and brisket. It was amazing... They ask you how you want your brisket cooked: lean, burnt, juicy (which also means fatty/greasy). We got the burnt because the inside was juicy even though the outside had the mesquite charcoal flavor... it was gooood.... Then they give you bread and sides (included potato salad, coleslaw and beans). It was definitely filling for about $17 a plate, but the price matched the great taste of TX BBQ flavor in your mouth!! We also got a half blackberry/half peach cobbler with a BIG scoop of vanilla icecream on top. The cobbler was warm while the ice cream was cold, it was delicious.. oh so delicious! We felt like our bellies were going to pop after that!!!\\n\\nThe waitress was awesome too.

Luckily, I found out the bar is non-smoking until 10pm, so it was fine for dinner. Phew!\\n\\nThe restaurant week menu allowed you to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert for $15, so I ordered the Crispy Grit Cake, Smoke Salmon Steak, and Tres Leches Cornbread Cake. \\n\\nCRISPY GRIT CAKE\\nThis was AMAZING. There was a pretty decent size serving of the grit cake in a flavorful mushroom sautee sauce. I was very pleased with the flavor, and it has similar flavors to the local mushroom risotto entree. \\n\\nSMOKE SALMON STEAK\\nThis salmon was cooked really well in the middle where it isn't too dry and not too raw. However, the outside was a bit too crispy. It came with a side of sweet potato fries, but they were the most delicate and non-substantial french fries I have ever eaten. The horseradish cream sauce tasted a bit smokey too, but it could have used a bit of lemon to counter the creaminess. \\n\\nTRES LECHES CORN CAKE\\nI have to be honest, I pretty much chose The Albert for restaurant week because I saw this on the menu. However, when I tried it after they brought it out, I just felt... confused. Tres leches cake is usually really moist and sweet, but the corn bread made it dry and a bit too salty to be a dessert. Overall, I wasn't a fan, but I'll give it points for being creative. \\n\\nTwas a fun place to try for restaurant week, and could definitely see myself coming here just to hang out over some drinks, so I'm glad I came. \\n\\n[48 of 100]"},{"name":"B Cafe","address":"405 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Rude service.

There are a lot stores, cafes, etc..., like a real downtown - surprising.  There is a lot of parking on the street and people are darting in and out of stores, so it wasn't difficult to find a space.  I wandered a bit to see what the town had and then headed into Ohlin's.  Even from the outside the place appears to have been stuck in time - and as you enter it is clear that this bakery has not changed much since it opened.  I am guessing that it has been around 40 years because of the decor, but it is just a guess.  As you enter you are faced with several bakery counters and walls lined with breads and pastries.  It is a small but manageable interior that allows 2-3 people to wander about, but any more than that and it would be a bit of a mess.  I did notice that they make a good bit of bread, that looked like the stuff you would find at a grocery store bakery, and there are several pastries that look very old school, too.  I was there for donuts so I discovered them in the case near the register and wasn't that excited - they appeared to be o.k. looking, so I was only going to order a single donut - so, I had to go with the honey dipped.  They are a good size, because I like to enjoy donuts but not feel they are going to be the only thing I eat that morning.  The donut did seem a little too soft, like some of the air had been let out - but if I wanted something sweet in the morning and I was in the center of town this would do the trick - especially since I believe it  was .80 cents.

Having said that... \\n\\nI cant figure out what the hell happened here! \\n\\nWe asked for sweet tea, and got insulted by the waitress saying we must not be from around here. That maybe they serve that at McDonalds but we don't do it like that in Texas. Oh freaking really?! I bleed Texas, don't tell me that crap woman. Just tell me no, and bring me some tea. \\n\\nI had the all you can eat, and my fiance had just a regular 'ol plate of foods. As I am eating my food I was thinking it was good, I am watching her face of horrible disgust. I think she is crazy and we start to discuss the food. \\n\\n\\"potatoes\\" -- I cant figure out what it was, how it was made, or why I thought it was amazing. Cool and different. Gimmie more and tell me how to make it. \\n\\nBeans, OK, run of the mill but thanks. \\n\\nBread- Is it a pound cake? It was cold, dense and different. I didn't want to eat it but found myself eating it, though am I not happy about this turn of events. \\n\\nBrisket - It was good. It was better than your average restaurant brisket I have had. But here's where it got a little interesting. My first round was good. My ladies was raunchy, and my second round was acceptable. I wound up giving her most of my second helping because I felt so horrible about her inedible food. Consistency is key, especially on the same table. My food needs to match her food. \\n\\nSausage - It was good. It wasn't special, I love BBQ sausage, smoked sausage, any kind of sausage. This stuff was edible, nothing fancy but I have had worse at Blacks BBQ. Run of the mill standard. Disappointing for the reputation that preceded the place. \\n\\nRibs - Something easy to screw up, and something hard to get right. I think the salt lick got somewhere in between. Maybe I expected too much, but I have had better ribs at lesser places. \\n\\nDid I mention our server was terrible? I wasn't even given a chance to throw my less than stellar food back at them because she wasn't around. \\n\\nDon't forget also, its BYOB. We were pressed for time to make a concert at Nutty Brown so we weren't able to bring the beer with us.

However I do know good food and especially good meat. I was so nervous that I would be disappointed or that we were wasting precious time hitting up this tourist destination but I'm so glad we did. \\n\\nOur waitress Chastity was wonderful. I saw her give a plate to our neighboring table and say, \\"you know what? That's not quite big enough. Let me take this back to get you another one\\". And she came back with a better piece for him! For us, she even gave us extra bread to nibble on because food was coming out slower than usual. I'm so used to popular restaurants just giving a shrug of sarcastic empathy when the wait is long I nearly asked for her hand in marriage. We were seated in half an hour and had our beers with us so we really weren't upset with the wait anyway. (This is record time! Came at around 1:30 on a Monday meant hardly a wait!) \\n\\nWe ordered the rancher with a little bit of everything on it and a pulled pork sandwich. If I go back I would want more of those ribs! They were everything I dreamed of; smokey, sweet, charred, fall apart. You only get one rib on this platter. The sausage, however, is plentiful and just as amazing as the reviews say! And oh my god the pulled pork sandwich was incredible. It made up for me not ordering more ribs! It was what you would be expecting out of your first taste of real BBQ. I'm sure there are other places in Texas that have far better BBQ, but this was already everything I was hoping for. \\n\\nThey have a bottle of their sauce for you at the table so don't worry about things being too dry for your preferences. I can see why some people thought the brisket was dry. It wasn't as juicy as I thought it would be from the borderline inappropriate scenes splashed on TV. But their service was so great if you told them it wasn't good enough, they would switch it for you. I didn't ask because I was already happy with everything else.  \\n\\nLastly (and Gloriously,) the peach cobbler was the best dessert I have ever had. Ever. Had. Even after we were literally too full to walk. Have it with the ice cream. It was warm, crispy on the outside, with a filling that transformed peaches into a caramel-like custard.

They also have some good open areas for larger groups and they are willing to accommodate you without question usually.\\n\\nThe staff is kind courteous and very professional.

We opted for a la carte and my father and I shared the much heralded crispy fried pig tails and the octopus. The pig tails were exciting to eat and did not taste at all what I was expecting; it had the general flavor and texture of a sweet Chinese dish with fried pork. The octopus was amazing; very tender and flavorful and well prepared; every last morsel was consumed. For my main I went with the Vermont pork three ways (as alas, I was not successful talking any of my table mates into sharing the pig face for two, despite my attempts to have Holly try and help sell this idea to one of my family members). Nevertheless I was very pleased with my dish. The pork three ways features pork confit, pork belly and a pork rib - all were good, though my only complaint was it was a bit over salted for my taste. Serving sizes for the all the courses were rather generous. \\n\\nHolly took great care of us all evening and while she was our principle server, they have a team approach and several other servers made sure we were always being looked after. Napkins were refolded during bathroom trips and water glasses always kept full. The pace of the meal was quite leisurely, which for us was a plus, but if you are looking for a fast dinner this might not be the best venue for you. The tables are set somewhat close together, but there are excellent acoustics and we noticed that despite a full house, it was not loud at all and was very easy to converse. \\n\\nThe best dish of the evening was the side of bone marrow that the table shared. This dish has a striking presentation; two large pieces of split cow femur set in the center of the table served with bread; you scoop the tender marrow onto the bread and wow was it good! I was pretty tempted to pick up the stripped bone and suck out the last few bits! Do not be scared to order this dish if you have not tried marrow before; while it sounds and looks a bit intimidating if you are into more plain foods, it does not taste challenging at all, just lots of great taste, texture and flavor. \\n\\nAll four of us settled on a different dessert. My wife went with the cheese plate (featuring three cheeses from Formaggio, each with a different accompaniment). I went with the trio of house made sorbets (the rum sorbet was my favorite). Dad had the affogato and mom went with a poached peaches with goat cheese. Each of us enjoyed the final course. When the check was delivered it came with one last tasty treat; some chocolate covered nut clusters that were also excellent. All in all an outstanding dinner and I will definitely be back (and if you are willing to share the pig face with me, message me and maybe we will go together)!"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The entrees are the only things that don't stand out.

We were seated at a table by the wall and promptly ignored for a good long time.

That alone warrants 5 stars. We ordered a large number of tapas as well as two of the larger plates and the food was all perfectly executed.

The rest of the tapas were fantastic: albondigas, patatas bravas, Brussels  sprouts, beef tongue, hanger steak, etc. And the two larger plates (we ordered one serving if each to share with three of us) were also great: the fidelo (calamari with past and squid ink) and the veggie paella. \\n\\nBut the veggie paella deserves its own story.  The veggie paella came to the table cooked perfectly, but we all felt it was far too salty (a bit of a heavy hand by the chef). They quickly offered to make another one, which showed great customer service. The paella is cooked to order (as it should be) and that meant it would be a little while before it would be out, but we were content  drinking more sangria and enjoying more of the exceptional bread and olive oil. \\n\\nThen Devon, one of the floor managers, came over to apologize for the saltiness and to say he'd like to send over a few additional tapas, at no charge, to enjoy while we waited.

The food offerings are by no means the most authentic in the area - or really even Mexican for that matter - but for the portions and price point, it's reasonably acceptable. However, I will say that the garage sale-chic decor needs to be sent to the curb immediately. I can tolerate a lot, but draw the line at high school cafeteria chairs, a tired old disco ball, and roller rink lockers. \\n\\nFood: Pure Taqueria is a severely Americanized Mexican restaurant with a fairly standard menu that includes burritos, taquitos, enchiladas, quesadillas, fajitas, and tacos. The bar menu includes a limited selection of wines, approximately a dozen different margarita options, and about 20 different bottled beers. My favorite appetizer is the queso fundido con chorizo, which is sizably portioned and accompanied by corn tortillas. For an entree, my go-to is the chicken quesadilla - although the management is using the term loosely when describing the dish. The quesadillas here are fully wrapped and fried like an empanada, rather than a traditional quesadilla - regardless, they're still flavorful and appropriately priced for the portion. \\n\\nService: Reasonably friendly and accommodating. The quality of service does tend to suffer during peak dining hours, but I've never really had a bad service experience here. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior of this place is certainly cleaner than a typically Mexican restaurant, but I wouldn't go as far as some other reviewers who have labeled it trendy or upscale. As noted earlier, the decor is random and in need of an overhaul. The bar is also in contention for being the smallest in the city of Atlanta. However, to the restaurant's credit, the outdoor patio is spacious and a nice respite during the summer months. \\n\\nCost: Moderately priced. Appetizers are $5.50-$11.50, taco plates are $8-$12, entrees are $9.50-$15, and salsas and sides are $1-$4. Brunch entrees are $8-$12. Desserts are $3-$7. \\n\\nOther: Hours of operation are 11AM-11PM daily. Brunch is served Saturday, 11AM-4PM, and Sunday all day. A separate gluten-free menu is available upon request.

I liked the ambiance - the dining room was very comfortable and my server greeted me immediately and brought me my drink.  I ordered from the American menu, and took a few minutes to review the offerings.  It displayed typical American Asian offerings and 6 \\"Cantonese\\" specials.  Lunch specials ranged from $6.95 to $7.95 based on you choice of protein (Pork and Chicken vs Beef and Shrimp.)  The special included your choice of Rice (steamed or fried) and choice of soup - (Egg Drop, Hot n Sour, or Wonton.)  Pretty reasonable.\\n\\nI ordered Spicy Dumplings for an appetizer and Sesame Chcicken with steamed rice and Egg Drop soup.  The soup came first - hot - sizeable bowl, not a cup.  Added a dash of pepper - and it was a good start.  The spicy dumplings came quickly in a nice soup bowl.  The dumplings were steamed and doused in a oily sauce that appeared to be standard sweet potsticker sauce enhanced with pepper oil and lots of garlic.  There was no heat in the sauce, other than the tang of the garlic - which was fine, but I had expected a little more zip or some peppery pulp in the sauce. - A solid 3 stars.\\n\\nThe Sesame Chicken came next - nice size portion.  No accompanying vegetable.  The dish was hot from the wok.  The taste was pretty unremarkable.  In fact I would say it was the worst sesame chicken I've had in some time.  The sauce had no flavor.  No zing from vinegar, no satisfying sweetness from honey.  It got worse, turning from a heavy glaze into a gelatinous tasteless goo.  Perhaps a bit too much cornstarch, if the sauce was even made from scratch?  It did have sesame seeds, so it was sesame chicken.  =)\\n\\nSo the authentic menu may be great.

A few pointers based on some negative comments I read:\\n\\n1. You're at a bar in the heart of L5P. If you're the type to get easily offended, don't even park your car in town - just keep driving. \\n2. You're at a place with the words \\"Beer Bar\\" in the title. If you assume that includes Miller Light and PBR, you need to think again. Look at the beer menu online first (they have more than 300 to choose from) - don't piss and moan when you get there because they don't offer you a Bud on tap -- P.S., they don't offer ANY domestic beers. Snobby? No. Educational and delicious? Yes.\\n3. Read the food menu before you come in as well. Nick and his crew are AMAZING in the kitchen (ex. - I'd never tried pork belly before, and didn't even know I'd like it and thanks to the Porter, now I know I do - but I was def wary at first). There are some eclectic items and it's not for everyone. Again, don't piss and moan (or worse yet, take it out on your server with a crappy tip or by sending your food back). If all you want is some average American fare, go somewhere else.\\n\\nOk, now that's out of the way, on to the real review of this place...\\n\\nI LOVE the Porter. I started going the summer after they opened in 2009, and it's continued to grow in business while remaining true to form. Bonus? At one time, I could get Southampton Publick House bottled beer (from my hometown in NY) while my bf could order a myriad of Bell's beers (from his hometown of MI). No where else in America have we both been able to enjoy hometown brews at the same time. Pretty awesome.\\n\\nAs the name suggests, the beer menu is intense. It's pages (and pages and pages) long. Overwhelming? Certainly. So, educate yourself. Read the menu. Talk to your server or bartender before your order. You can taste-test anything on the draft menu (within reason) and they're quick to make several suggestions based on what you tell them you're used to enjoying. But I'd also tell you to try things outside your comfort zone, just because you never know what you might find you like (I never knew I was a huge stout fan until this place introduced me to those delicious, rich, coffee-chocolately delights). They also have a full bar with liquor, wine, and several special concoctions (I love the grapefruit margarita and lemon ginger vodka drinks). \\n\\nThe first page of the food menu includes constantly changing specials. If you ever have a chance to try Nick's version of a Monte Cristo sandwich, DO IT! But share it. And even in splitting, you might have a heard attack from the fried-goodness of this amazing beast of a sammy. Amazing. The specials always include a cheese platter and salads made from locally grown ingredients (in fact, most of the menu features local products). The special starters are usually pretty small, so if you're planning on sharing with a large group, order more rather than less. Their french fries are my FAVE thing ever (best I've ever eaten, and I'm a girl who loves her fries) - if you order something that comes with fries as a side, DEF order the onion mayo that comes with the appetizer fries. My go-to if I don't feel like any specials is usually the Reuben or shrimp po-boy. So tasty! I've never ordered anything I didn't love. \\n\\nTips for newbies: \\n\\n1. Parking can get a little tight in L5P. There are pay-for lots around, which are sometimes the best route around happy-hour time. But check out side streets first, because you can usually find a spot if you look for a minute...\\n2. The Porter is a busy place these days, especially for the dinnertime and late night crowds. If you can get a spot at the bar, that's the best place to sit (and don't be thrown off if your 'tender is initially not the most overly-friendly person, give them a few drinks to warm up to you - before you know it, you'll be a regular!).\\n3. Don't be afraid to ask questions about the menu - beer or food. Your server or bartender will tell it like it is. Those people take their jobs seriously (very, very low turnover there). Take their advice, they usually know what they're talking about. \\n4. If you're not familiar with L5P, don't be intimidated by the atmosphere. It's kitschy and ecclectic (much like the Porter itself is!), with a huge variety of people. Just go in with an open mind to enjoy the experience before you start judging."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came here for restaurant week.\\n\\nOur starters were a bit confusing...I had the corn soup which came with bacon (shouldn't you say that) and the 'steakhouse salad' came with no steak.

I learned this only recently, while planning for my mother-in-law's 60th birthday party.  She was born and bred in Texas, and we wanted to give the party a Texas flair, so I contacted the president of the local chapter of Texas Exes (that's the University of Texas alumni association) and asked him how we could put a little Longhorn in our party.  He had one answer: The Salt Lick.  So we ordered a box of dry rub and bbq sauce from Austin and slathered it all over our home-made beef brisket.  \\n\\nThe results were beautiful.  It's not what a Seattle-ite thinks of when he thinks of barbeque sauce.  It is light, not thick, and not too sweet or too sour.  It offers hints of mustard and honey.

She checked with the kitchen and said it'd be another 15 minutes. When we finally got the food (after waiting about an hour and a half at that point) it was good, but really not worth the wait. Also, since both of our entrees were stews, we didn't understand how it could possibly take that long unless they hadn't made it yet? I don't know. The waitress said there had been some sort of mix up in the kitchen, so maybe they just forgot about us. I'd be more forgiving if it were a very large restaurant, but there were maybe 5 tables (counting us) with customers and a few people at the bar. From looking at other reviews this isn't the first time this has happened.\\n\\nTo top it all off the Thi√©baud Djeun is a fish stew and, while most of it was delicious, there was one large piece that tasted bitter (the sort of taste when a fish isn't cleaned properly).

They're open for breakfast and lunch, and thankfully they knew man (or woman) cannot be a thriving business on soup alone. So their menu contains things like griddle cakes, grits, bagels, and 'breakfast in the 'hood,' which runs a reasonable five dollars. \\n\\nLunch fare has a smattering of sandwiches and salads - a small selection, which means there's a likely chance of fresh ingredients. \\n\\nAnd then on to the soup - there are a couple evergreen choices on the menu and a rotating selection displayed on the chalkboard. I had the spicy cream of tomato, which tastes much as the menu describes (like pizza without the crust!). It also comes with a lovely 'fresh baked organic corn muffin.' I didn't ask, but I have a feeling they don't have saltines here to go with your soup. Not hip enough. \\n\\nSpeaking of hip, Stone Soup is somewhere you probably won't happen to drive by, unless you live in the neighborhood.

But an actual, intellectual exchange of ideas (or opinions) and genuine interest.  Now, I must note that if you're the type who likes a quiet place to get away, then this won't be the place for you (at least in the cafe area). For example, tonight, a girl pretty much laid out her whole life story to some kind, old man for the whole place to overhear how accomplished she is, how she's been all over the world, all that she's been through, blah blah BLAH... but you know what? I'm happy she reached out to a stranger and made a connection. It's nice to see complete strangers striking up a lovely dialogue, when so often everyone has their heads down and avoid eye contact. And this is the kinda place that allows that kind of spontaneous interaction to happen.

The eggplant caponata was overpowered by tomatoes, as were the mussels, which came drenched in heavy tomato sauce that tasted like marinara from a jar. The shrimp was bland; the chorizo with figs cloyingly sweet; and a bean stew so salty that it was inedible.

Whenever I go to Jason's I tend to stick with the bowl (or cup) of soup and the salad bar combo. I think it is a great deal for around nine bucks. My favorite soup choice is red beans and rice.\\n\\nOn the salad bar, Jasons deli has mixed field greens, spinach, romaine lettuce, sliced yellow peppers, marinated artichoke hearts, blue cheese crumbles, alfalfa sprouts, sliced cucumbers, real bacon bits, cherry tomatoes, roasted red pepper hummus, sliced onions, kalamata olives, green olives, shredded cheddar cheese, potato salad, olive tapanade, and pasta salad. \\n\\nThere are lots of other items on the salad bar I cannot recall seeing; however, the dressings and other various items seem like they are made from scratch in-house rather than outsourced. Perhaps not the best salad bar in town; however, certainly better than Sweet Tomatoes or Lettuce Souprise You. I think JD's salad bar is more vegetarian friendly than other restaurant salad bars with respect to overall quality and variety of items.\\n\\nIf I go to Jason's and opt to order something other than the salad bar, I usually go for the broccoli and cheese baked potato. It is really two baked potatoes placed side by side and smothered with their seemingly made from scratch broccoli and cheese soup and covered with cheddar cheese, green onions, chopped onions, and bacon bits. You can add more cheese, onions and bacon bits from the salad bar if you want (but they don't tell you that). \\n\\nYeah its true Jason's Deli is fair to middling in the sandwich department, but I wish all the haters could see past that and appreciate all the other offerings JD does have."},{"name":"Whole Heart Provisions","address":"487 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"I really love this place, but unfortunately four times I have left with either an order that is off from what I ordered online, or with a few missing things:( I guess it's partially up to me to check, but I don't always have time as I often get it in the go!

Food was bland and pricey, as others have noted, but my main beef was with the server, Michael, who gave us the bum's rush from the second we sat down. We sat outside (Sunday night) and here's a partial list of the problems:\\n1. Set up was for 2, not 4 - we stole from another table\\n2. Waiter approached - didn't say \\"Welcome\\" nor his name (I only got it from the bill!), just said, \\"Tap water OK?\\".  Then he brought the water and said, \\"Do you know what you want?\\" I said, \\"Sure, can we see a drink list?\\"\\n3. He came by at 3 times asking if we were ready to order, while we had our menus clearly open.\\n4. My son asked for the wine list and he said \\"What do you want - I'll get you a glass.  Chardonnay or Pinot grigio?\\" Never produced a wine list.\\n5. Then he disappeared DURING the meal.  Had to grab random waiters/busboys to get black\\n pepper, grated cheese for my pasta, pack up leftovers, etc.\\n6. Had to ask for dessert list. \\n\\nHe showed up at the end of the meal to perfunctorily ask how things were and looked at the tip (more than he deserved) right in front of us.

As you've probably noticed, I've given them 4. Here's why:\\n\\nThe food was pretty good. We did the Korean Barbeque Combo 1 and got a few pieces of sushi. The sushi, while not bad, did not rank as one of the better sushi I've had in the Boston area. \\n\\nIn pseudo-contrast, he barbeque combo platter was great! They really give you a large quantity of food; the combo platter was meant for 2 people, but we were able to split it between three people just fine (plus some sushi). \\n\\nAs part of the platter, we got beef, chicken, and pork bulgogi as well as kalbi. I especially enjoyed the beef bulgogi and the kalbi, and the pork was ok. I'm really sensitive to spice, so I struggled with the pork a bit. However,I really wasn't a fan of the chicken bulgogi. I'm not sure if it was the marinade or the cut of chicken, but it really didn't do it for me. \\n\\nIn addition to the meat, it also included vegetables. They were fine. As part of the combo platter, they also have us two bowls of rice and miso soup. They also had a bunch of little side dishes, such as pickled daikon.\\n\\nSo, why didn't it get five stars? Mostly because I wasn't super impressed with their service. The service was ok, but they really didn't come around that often given that you are cooking the food. I've been to other Korean bbq restaurants where they practically hovered over you to make sure the food was cooked correctly. While that's REALLY not necessary, our food would have burned if we had waited for them.

So, so many times have I sort of missed my chances to go. But not this time. A couple of weeks ago, two friends and I agreed to meet there for lunch, and I was pretty excited. And it's a good spot for a summer lunch; pretty much abandoned and with attentive waitstaff who bring you many, many rounds of beers. I will say, the atmosphere was not what I was expecting- it's a more tourist- friendly space, but the lofted ceilings are nice, and it is sort of Southern barbecue meets prepster Boston, which I guess is fine. The most awkward thing we encountered was the meat preparation going on between the restaurant and the restrooms; somehow walking by an in-use meat grinder is not the most appetizing thing. But it was Friday at 2:30, and I'm sure they were getting ready for a very busy evening, plus I doubt that's something you'd encounter at most times.\\nNow, on to the food. We had a very nice charcuterie plate. It might have been nice if there had been some better descriptions of what we were getting on the menu, or if our server had had interest in telling us about them, but it is nice to have pre-crafted, balanced charcuterie plates. Also nice that they were more than generous in giving us more of the delicious, buttery grilled Iggy's bread that comes along with the charcuterie. We ordered the Domestic, which had a salami and dry cured pork shoulder, which were both very good, plus a nice cheddar and yummy charred peppers. It was a well-balanced if not very adventurous plate, and it made me wish we could have ordered another to try something a little more out there. We then shared the Prosciutto Crudo sandwich, and I must say, it was incredible. It's not like prosciutto and fig sandwichs aren't common, but this was a masterful creation. Perfectly balanced flavors, and eloquently prepared, with warm bread, melty cheese, and a great mix of sweet and salty. We also got the Mushroom pizza, which was also very good, with a nice egg in the middle and plenty of bright, springy herb and veggie flavors. Hands down, though, the sandwich won in a contest.\\nI would love to go back to The Salty Pig to try others- I would totally recommend this as a big group option so that there could be some trying and sharing. Our group of three did away with the charcuterie, sandwich, and pizza pretty easily, but we certainly didn't need more.\\nThe prices are a little steep, but no more so than you'd expect for that neighborhood, and the beer list is fun. Those really aren't over-priced, and they certainly make for a relaxing afternoon. All in all, I have to say The Salty Pig is an excellent stop, and by far the most excellent in its surrounding blocks."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Contrary to popular opinion I actually think Antico is okay.

This place is out in the countryside so space is not an issue which is probably why they expanded with a larger second dining hall. There is even an on-site winery, but The Salt Lick has a BYOB policy too. I saw folks lugging in large iced coolers filled with alcoholic beverages of their choice. You won't see this at any urban restaurant.\\n\\nWe came early for dinner, and there was no wait to get seated. The host led us to a table in the newer dining hall which was about 3/4 full. The open BBQ fire pit loaded with meats on the grill was in plain sight to the left as we walked to our table.\\n\\nI wanted to try a sample of items so The Rancher was the perfect plate to order from the menu. It consisted of brisket, one pork rib, one regular sausage and turkey for $17.95. Three standard sides (beans, cole slaw and potato salad) were included with each dinner plate. My favorites were the pork rib and turkey. I was probably spoiled by the brisket and sausage I had eaten at previous BBQ joints the last few days. I didn't like the cole slaw as it was too tart for my taste while the beans and potato salad were fine.\\n\\nBetween the outdoor seating and the two dining halls, this place can easily hold a few hundred customers at a time. It does lead to a rather noisy environment as we could barely hear each other across the table even with raised voices.

I actually lived in one of the BU units above the restaurant in the summer of 2011, and that's when I fell in love. Not only is the food consistently delicious, both in the restaurant and when delivered, but the staff are kind, appreciative, and they ALWAYS get the order right, which can sometime be a challenge when you're ordering multiple different dishes, which I typically do when having Chinese food. I'm a huge fan of their spicy string beans and their lo mein. I don't know much about what makes Chinese cuisine \\"traditional\\" or not, but as a Jewish resident of the Boston area, I've tried a lot of different Chinese restaurants, and Beijing Cafe is my absolute favorite. I'm so disappointed to read so many negative reviews of a small restaurant that I think is such a gem in the area. The owners care about their food, their service, and their customers, and I have only had positive experiences! I've ordered Beijing Cafe delivery with friends on many occasions, and they have all loved it as well! I even have a friend who ONLY wanted Beijing Cafe after a bad breakup, and a friend from out of town who wants to order it every time she visits. I don't drink tea, but apparently theirs is amazing. Also, who CARES what the inside of the restaurant looks like? Go eat at a fancy schmancy place if you care so much about decor whilst eating. Good service  + good food = more than good enough.

All I could think was how it does not compare to Disney.  Everything seems a bit dated, and I just found that there was not enough to fill the entire day with activity.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the Mardi Gras parade.  We sat on the curb near Mel's Diner, and it was fun to collect as many beads as I could.  The floats were colorful and exciting.  However, before the parade began, two policemen on motorcycles came around, and drove as close as they could to the edge of the curb, in order to have people keep their feet off the street.  I was appalled at how dangerous this was.  If a small child or anyone for that matter, had moved accidentally, the motorcycles could have ran right over their feet.\\n\\nI also really enjoyed the fifteen minute magic show in the store in Beverly Hills.  It was captivating and left me wondering how did they do that?\\n\\nThe Shrek 4-D show is very funny and cute.  It's so fun how the seat moves and you really feel like you're right in the movie with the characters.  A must-do.\\n\\nThe Revenge of the Mummy coaster is my favorite ride in this park.  It can be a little intense for those who don't love roller coasters, but I find it great fun.  The fire is so hot!\\n\\nTwister is a waste of time.  You watch a lot of pre-ride films, and then you go into a set where wind and rain blow on you.  Don't bother.\\n\\nJaws is absurd.  It's so outdated.  There is nothing scary or exciting about this ride, and it's basically a waste of time.  Our tour guide was very awkward and made it unpleasant.

It was my first time ever dining at the lauded restaurant and the experience left me rather disappointed and unsure if I'd go back. \\n\\nAs a party of 8 women, we had an 8:30pm reservation but had to wait approximately 45 minutes (in heels) to be seated. Of note, the staff offered us sparkling wine, which without their saying it, we took as an apology for having kept us waiting, corralled in a tight, inconvenient space where we were bumped about and shuffling out of passers-bys' ways.  \\n\\nThere is some sort of confusion about where we were supposed to be seated as my friend who made the reservations was under the impression that we were going to be seated in the dining room; however, it became clear that they were setting us up in the bar area. As she attempted to discuss the situation, my friend said that the hostess was rude, impatient, and dismissive.\\n\\nFinally seated, our experience improved significantly.  We had a serving duo with one of them Jeremy, a new server, who was particularly attentive and pleasant.  At about 9:40pm, about 20 mins after being seated and 70+ mins of waiting, I had to ask our female server if we could put in our food order, to which happily obliged.  When someone ordered the hogshead, she appropriately alerted them that it would take about 45 mins to prepare. \\n\\nAll of us quite enjoyed our appetizers as they were served rather quickly and were enticing. Additionally, the the hogsheads came up in the window of time she stated.  Unfortunately, the hogsheads was not a hit with the women who ordered it but the staff was quick to remove it from the table and from the check, offering other food options for my friends. I was impressed by the gracious and swift handling of this situation. And as for me, my sirloin was cooked perfectly and was delicious. So what had started off as a frustrating experience, made a full turn throughout dinner. Unfortunately, it was during the dessert course that the \\"wheels fell off the wagon\\" once again. \\n\\nFor dessert, my friend prepaid for one of Craigie's cake. The brought it out and presented it to the table, but then took it back to cut it. At this point, it then took about another 30 mins for them to cut and serve the cake, which seemed excessive and only fanned the previously weaning flames fire of frustration, though not specifically for me. Instead, I had my own separate issues of frustration and very poor service. \\n\\nWhile waiting for the cake, I asked the female server what teas they had, she just named \\"black, green, and herbal.\\" I was surprised at her response but politely asked her to be specific about the herbal teas. She initially stated they only had only two herbal teas, a red zen and a rooibos, but then added that there was a third blended tea. I said I'd hope for something fruitier but I'd take the red zen.  About a min later, I asked our other server, Jeremy, for the dessert menu so I could see it since I'd never dined there. Jeremy brought the menu back immediately and I saw that there were about 6 different herbal teas, specifically they had a simple hibiscus tea, something I mentioned I'd like, to the female server.  Jeremy called her over and I asked her if she'd already put my order in for the tea because I actually wanted the hibiscus instead. She told me it was okay and that she would update the order, however, only mins later she returned with a pot of tea, poured it, lied to me when I specifically asked if it was the hibiscus tea (she said it was) and sharply responded to me that \\"it was fine\\" when I asked if it had enough time to steep, and then walked away and did not return. I asked Jeremy to come over and verify that I received the correct tea, because it appeared to be the red zen. He took it to the kitchen and returned with the correct tea, apologizing for the other server's mistake. \\n\\nI can not say if this server either made a simple mistake, mistakenly underestimated my knowledge of tea to know the difference, or if she is working as a lead server but does not know Craigie's featured teas.  Yet, this whole tea exchange was the tipping point for me and my personal experience there. \\n\\nThroughout the evening, I anticipated moments of waiting since we were a large party. I also appreciated that the management tried to offer some sort of amends for keeping us waiting for so long. Furthermore, I was happy with my meal and found the food worthy of a positive review.  The service to our large party, on the other hand, was deplorable.  \\n\\nI write this review unsure of whether a large parties happens to be Craigie on Main's Achilles heel or if the fact that our particularly diverse, large party played some part in us receiving poor service. Most of the other women in our group do not share my concerns as to the reason we received such service, but we all undeniably agree that our service was unacceptable (with the clear exception of Jeremy)."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Orlando East Colonial","address":"2600 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was good.

I simply cannot believe how RUDE the staff is.  I called to place an order for a cake and because it was five minutes before closing the lady made it very clear that she would NOT take my order and that she did not care that I knew exactly what I wanted and when.  She refused to give me the name of her bosses, and when I asked her what her name was she told me she had forgotten.  I asked her if she preferred that I take my business elsewhere and she said she did not care, and hung up on me. Of course, I called back. The second lady was just as RUDE, said that a manager was not available and after tiring of my relentless questions, finally put on a \\"manager\\", Jacquelyn, whose attitude was EVEN WORST!  She offered to take my order since I wouldn't stop calling. She acknowledged she had heard her staff talk rude to me and when asked if that was okay with her, she said yeah, that's fine, you shouldn't call five minutes before we are closing.  She refused to give me her bosses name unless I gave her my order and when I asked her if she really expected me to place an order after encountering such poor customer service from them, she said she could care less and I was welcomed to go somewhere else, that they had plenty of business.  Well, I'm glad to hear SWEETISH HILL BAKERY that you have so much business that you can afford for your staff to be rude to your customers and you can afford to turn away customers!!

The host suggested finding a seat upstairs and they'd call us when a table was ready, which was fine with us. However, before we'd had a chance to order, the server came and asked us to move because a party of six was going to be sitting at the next table (and apparently needed our booth as well?). The other table was marked reserved, but this one was not. Whatever. Not the end of the world.\\n\\nWe moved to a table with less comfortable chairs and across the aisle from a booth of three young women, who were soon joined by three more friends, two of them large men. They couldn't all fit at a four top, so one of the men found a nearby chair and sat at the end of the table, with his back less than a foot from our table. I'm not claustrophobic, but this made me uncomfortable. They were also so loud that my friend and I could barely hear each other. The server was very solicitous to them (in fact, I believe he provided the chair); so much so, in fact, that he barely paid any attention to us. We considered waiting, but as we'd only been there fifteen minutes at that point, it seemed unlikely that we'd get outside anytime soon, and the only other free table was the one we'd already vacated, so we left to find somewhere else for dinner.

The first 2 times I was very unimpressed... the crust took about 40% of the pizza and one slice was almost entirely a crust bubble! Their pizza is delicious and their crust is a perfect mix of chewy and crispy but I did not pay the money for bread. So the 3rd time I came prepared and asked them at the front to make sure there isn't such a huge crust. He suggested I ask for extra sauce and cheese to make that happen so I did... well the crust was again too large and then the pizza was soggy. \\n\\nIt seems like all I am doing is ranting so why the 4 stars? BECAUSE ITS FREAKIN GOOD! The 60% pizza I got, in all its glory with toppings and sauce, was so good I could easily finish a whole pizza by myself.

I'm not sure how long it has been this way but several of the people there who were studying were also surprised when the staff gently announced that they were closed.\\n\\nAlthough I had showed up just before midnight and they had been cleaning equipment and had already wrapped up all of their food they still made me a mocha and were very polite and friendly about it. I've been turned away or given bad attitude by other businesses when it's nearly closing time so to be treated with such a positive attitude helped me feel that it was still worth the trip. Overall I find that the staff there are always really friendly and welcoming. On two separate occasions where I watched customers return with a drink, one over an issue of the flavor of his tea and the other over feeling he had been given the wrong type of blended drink, they replaced the drinks with a smile, apology and no fuss.\\n\\nI regret that they aren't still open until much later, I can imagine them doing well if they chose to stay open longer if not all night.

Well, that depends on if it was worth the 7 hour round trip.\\n\\nAnswer: Yes.\\n\\nWe stopped by a 7-Eleven in Austin to get ice & beer. If you are heading in from Austin, we saw a store on the way at the intersection of 45 & RM 1826. From 45, it's about a 10 mile drive (gorgeous countryside) and then you will descend upon the great lakes of full parking lots. There is no missing it.\\n\\nDrop off someone to put your name in and then find a spot. Unload the cooler and have a seat near the beer & wine tasting room, or by the stage if you can find a spot. There is some great people watching (and eavesdropping) here. I observed: three tipsy guys trying to play bocce ball, one chick repeatedly bending over in a dress that was way too tight (and short), two kids throwing rocks at each other, a family playing cards, two guys arguing about how sober they were (at least I think that's what they were slurring), and one kid that refused to get up from sitting/crying on his father's shoe. If you forget your beer, they sell iced buckets of 5 bottles.\\n\\nThe next thing I knew, our name was being called. I felt kind of bad because we had a huge table to ourselves. The waitress let us borrow her corkscrew for the bottle of wine we brought (No corkage fee - no way does this happen in CA).\\n\\nDear goodness, I ordered the brisket. This was unlike any other brisket I have had in my life. It's difficult to describe. I don't know how they do it so consistently. Can every plate have a pile of perfectly smoked, seasoned, high quality beef cooked to perfection?  I guess it can. I guess that's why people drive 200+ miles and wait over an hour and a half to experience it.  The side dishes were equally as delicious, although not the star of the plate.\\n\\nI took a quick picture in front of the open pit & cried all the way home. I miss you Salt Lick!

The are outwardly bothered anytime you're looking for a tv or game. They let you know you're bothering them. I mean there's plenty of tvs to go around, right? But it's not just that. There isn't any decent service if you're not watching a game either. Employees don't welcome or address you even when you walk up and stand right next to them, looking at their faces. They just gossip to each other about what so-and-so did last night while they were wasted or after their shift. It's shocking to me that a place like this doesn't shut down in Portland.

Upon entering, we were greeted by the hostess and I believe the owner but it was disturbing to see behind the that there was a broom and vacuum. (Really should hide the cleaning equipment). We sat apparently at a table in the range of the bar such that our server was the bartender which on initial presentation seemed like it would be good as the only other server seemed swamped.  However, as time progressed we quickly realized that we wished we had the other server because despite having 6 other tables he was very attentive. \\n\\nWe ordered two appetizers which came out fairly timely but our meal (the special-braised short rib ravioli) took way too long to arrive. All the while my husband needed a refill on his drink the server passed us several times without checking on us, the female owner passed by several times without even a glance, followed by the male owner who went to chat at the bar with the hostess who sat eating at the bar.  Oddly she sat eating, talking to the bartender (out server) and sat there with a to go cup and bag of food until all of a sudden she got up to go clear a table of their plates. \\n\\nWhile the two other tables that were set after us receive their food we set still waiting for maincourse. Finally it arrived. It was touted as being a great special but unfortunately fell short. The short ribs were savory however someone clearly over thought that dish. The sauce overpowered the dish almost to the point of being too salty. while ravioli seems to be an interesting twist to almost a classic pot roast flavored short rib dish a  mashed sweet potato would  have been better.  Thank God my husband had ordered the maduros (sweet plantains) as an appetizer that we had kept to eat with the meal as it made each bite more palatable.  Neither one of us were able to even finish our meals. We did end up eating or two appetizers which were the fried green tomatoes and the maduros. \\n\\nAfter eating we waited a significant amount of time to see if anyone would follow up whether it be either of the owners or the bartender but not so lucky.  We were blessed by the other server who came to check on us and was very pleasant.  \\n\\nWhile we discussed the meal and we're hopeful that someone would come by to actually make it a more pleasant experience it failed to happen.  We were actually greeted by the other server who was not tending to us who came and asked if we enjoyed our meal. After long discussion prior to his arrival on whether or not we should even make any complaints my husband chose to keep his peace and thought it would be best to just pay the bill and leave. My husband instead recommended that maybe we should yelp the review. I had not checked in at that point and chose to. Upon doing so realize that entitled me to a free  glass of wine so we opted to just get the free glass of wine pay the bill and leave. Upon showing our server that I had this coupon from yelp I anticipated that he would advise the owners that I was on yelp and one would at least checkin on us but that didn't happen. \\n\\nOverall very disappointing experience compared to our first dining experience.  We will not go go back. I will say the nice blonde server was our prior server months ago and he was very very pleasant even as we exited he made sure to make contact with us.

The lobster tails were so salty my mother, whom I have never seen send anything back, had to. To their credit, they took it off the bill with no hesitation. If the menu says grilled, it means breaded and fried. Both the salmon and the scallops were served with a heavy crusted breading, then fried. My ongoing rant is salad dressing or other sauces that have added sugar when they are intended to be savory. The balsamic vinaigrette was unfortunately sweet, when it would have been better without the added sugar. As it was, I find it hard to believe anyone would care for it, even those that don't mind sugar in their dressings. The razor clams were done well, difficult to do. The sourdough bread was great. The wait for food seemed excessive given the volume of the restaurant, but perhaps the kitchen was understaffed as well as the front.

Nobody had better deep fried Halibut. To us, Nobody came close.\\nI was addicted to the Halibut. My girlfriend was too. Together, we spent over 3K on BV that first year. Crazy right? And that was when they were 30% cheaper than now.\\nBut back then, the quality was consistently good. It was rare to get a disappointing meal. By 2010 when we moved to Seatac, the poor consistency had cured us of the addiction. We would go there occasionally but were too often reminded why we lost that lovin feeling. The cost went up but the quality and portion sizes, which were small to begin with, got smaller. Unless you got lucky and hit them on a fresh oil day, the food had a rancid taste, especially if they dumped stale leftovers on us which apparently is a acceptable practice now. We found better regular options for takeout but tonight we both had a craving for that crisp, sweet, deep fried Halibut. It meant a 60 mile road trip. Definitely Crazy. It had been years since we had been to a BV and we hoped that explaining our road trip to the girl behind the counter would inspire them to serve up their A game. She was very nice but alas, no A game.\\nThe pieces of outrageously expensive fish were about 1/2 as thick as we remembered them being and therefore dry and flavorless. All we tasted was the over used and slightly bitter oil. The French Fries were stale and greasy beyond edibility.\\nEven the lemon slices were tasteless. For this and a couple of Cokes we are out over $30 bucks! The only good thing about this experience is the fact that we are both completely over Burgerville.

I should have turned around and walked out the  minute I saw no customers during the lunch rush. The thoughts that came across my mind when I saw the open sea of empty tables was: 1.)

Read that they have great lobster rolls. The 1 star is for the fish. The -4 stars is for the saltiness of the food and the poor service. \\n\\nCame in solo. Was 'served' by Kate L. No smile, not friendly. Right then and there I got the vibe, this server was not going to be pleasant. And my gut is always right. She left a pen and small menu on my table, no explano, and didn't ask me what I wanted to drink. She just said, \\"tap water alright?\\" OK. Even though I came for the lobster roll, I can't resist when a restaurant offers a whole branzino. Ordered that plus a side of grilled corn and the tuna crudo. All of it came pretty quick. While the fish itself was delish, the pickled cucumbers on the plate were too salty as was the grilled corn. Did not touch the cukes or barely the corn. The tuno crudo would have been perfect if they didn't sprinkle sea salt flakes on them. Why so much salt on all the food? The tuna did not need it, it was great on its own. \\n\\nBut I never got to share this, since the waitress never came to check on me. So I never had a chance to tell her 'how is everything'. Never came by to refill my water. She came once to remove my crudo plate towards the end of my meal. Never said a word, I was expecting at least a, 'how was everything' after the fact. Actually, the last words between us was when I ordered the food. The bus boy came and cleared my plate. He wasn't sure to take the bowl of corn, especially since I hadn't really touched it. To add to the frustration, I sat there waiting and waiting for her to bring my check. I had credit card in hand as she walked by me numerous times. I was patient - until I wasn't. I asked a busser to please ask my waitress to bring my check. She still did not come. Instead, the busser brought it and took my credit card. He left to process payment. Then she came by, only to give me a snide smile, remove something from my table, and walk away. Seriously? The busser brought back my check. Kate L. never bothered to even say thank you for coming in. All the while, am noticing everyone else around me is being helped by pleasant waitstaff. And she was even pleasant to other customers nearby. I don't know why she chose me to treat like crap, but after leaving the restaurant the whole experience left me feeling bad...bad that I chose this place and bad that I gave her more tip then she deserved.\\n\\nSurprising that you have such a lousy waitperson who even at the very least, couldn't be bothered to say goodbye/thank you to me. When I ordered the branzino I told myself I would come back tomorrow night to get the lobster roll. After tonight's experience, no way. And I'll tell my colleagues not to come here. \\n\\nI don't expect a server to be my best friend, just provide the service.

The blazing heat touches your skin from the parking lot, but quickly gets replaced as your nose whiffs the hickory dry BBQ smell. With sights of wood logs, chips, and lumber we enter Salt Lick BBQ.  \\nAs I enter I couldn't help but notice the first sign \\"BYOB\\" for all you non-alcoholic yelpers that's Bring Your Own Bottle. Immediately I wanted to go to the nearest Sam's Club and buy a case of Coronas, though I didn't. Walking further into the restaurant I saw the largest pit of smoke with the most deliciously juicy cuts of meat I've ever seen. My eyes were like a kid's first time at Toys 'R Us. \\nAs we were seated I was glanced at the decor simple yet rugged feel. Long polished wooden tables and benches no fancy lightning just large windows so the sun could enter. As well as outdoor seating. \\nAfter receiving my menu I knew what I wanted. MEAT N BEER!!! My sister recommend I grab the all you can eat pork ribs, beef brisket, sausages, potato salad, coleslaw and beans for $19.95. Not bad price especially if you can eat as much as I can (I had 3 rounds of food). The waiter let us know there was beer we can get in their shop outskirt of the dining area. My sisters boyfriend and I headed out there. We got a 6 of Fireman beer $10. We weren't sure what we got into because we're so used to Coronas, Heinekens, Coors, etc. As we arrived back plates of meat cover the table with 3 large sides of coleslaw, potato salad, and beans. Not hesitating I quickly sat down cracked a beer bottle open and dug in. \\nThe meats were so smokey with char that made it extremely flavorful. They had 2 signature BBQ sauces 1 spicy and 1 sweet. I chose the sweet it's the best because the tender meat pairs well with the sweetness of the sauce. I ate and ate and ate some more! Drank more too. The beer had a tasty wooden cold brew to wash down the beef brisket. I was eating so much meat forgot we had sides. So I tried the coleslaw and it was so light n refreshing. Not packed with mayonnaise. Lightly tossed in ginger type dressing crunchy and sharp. The potato salad was more like a mash bit sweet which was also great. Didn't get to tried beans because I was more focus on more MEAT. \\nAs I filled up the last bit. My sis said you can take it to go. My eyes out up more and I immediately thought I can have more this later?! We packed it up to go. My girlfriend (aka  my wine and dine partner in crime) wanted dessert so the waiter suggested their famous pecan pie. He said its so good he had slice for breakfast with scoop ice cream. As we received our slice I only wanted little taste because I'm not big fan of sweets. So I took a tiny piece with my fork and it was AMAZING!!! I thought to myself this place keeps getting better and better. I wanted to steal my girlfriends dessert. The warm chewy pieces of pecans with cookie crust edge and bottom topped with a scoop of cold vanilla ice cream was literally the cherry on top of an amazing dinner. It was so damn good I order a pie to go for $20.

Skip down to get a review of the food, the following is my service experience.\\n\\nMy friends and I agreed to hit up Craigie on Main after one of Harvard's wonderful Science of Cooking lectures.  Considering there would be three or four of us, I decided it was best to reserve a table the week before.  I was particularly interested in their burger, which I had heard good things about,  and the deep fried pig's tail with nuoc cham which tickled my fancy for offal'y food.\\n\\nTwo of us arrived on time, before my third friend could join us.  We were seated at the table and were reviewing the menu.  Unfortunately, I hadn't realized that Craigie had a bar menu and a dinner menu and both the burger and the pig's tail were absent from the dinner menu.  I asked our waiter if we could order a couple of items from the bar menu as well, the answer was a clear \\"No.\\"  Considering the two items I had come there for were not available in the dining area, I asked if we could be moved there.  The waiter said they would check, and the answer was yes and we were relocated.  My friend detected an attitude about our request, and a coldness after that (I try to ignore such things personally, and focus on what I'm there for.. the food). \\n\\nWe got relocated to a table at the bar area, and were given the bar menu, which had some overlap with the dinner menu (largely the intriguing half a pig's head).  However, there was a cock's comb salad from the dinner menu that intrigued us, and we asked if we could possibly order from the dinner menu in the bar area. Again, the answer was a clear \\"No.\\"  Sadness.\\n\\nAnyway, the third friend joined us, and we quickly decided what we were going to try...\\n\\nThe deep fried pig's tail\\nThe Craigie burger\\nBrussels sprouts cooked in duck fat\\nChicken thigh confit over seasonal vegetables\\nThe 3 pate plate\\n\\nThe deep fried pig's tail was pretty damned tasty and worth a try if you are into that sort of thing (which I most emphatically am), though at 15 dollars for six small bites (or 2 each), it was either a couple bucks too expensive or several pieces too small (I would be tempted to order two next time, if it were a little cheaper).\\n\\nThe Craigie burger is indeed worth the, roughly, 20 dollars it comes out to... We ordered it medium (the house recommends MR). It was well cooked, flavorful, the texture was wonderful, and I would not hesitate to get it again. The fries were also quite well done, and the salad was a nice palette cleanser. \\n\\nI found the Brussels sprouts bland and underwhelming, they were perfectly fine but just not that interesting compared to the other dishes. My friend defended their virtue, though was a bit taken aback when I reminded him they were 9 dollars. \\n\\nThe chicken thigh confit was also superbly cooked with crisped skin, but what I really appreciated were the vegetables underneath in that slightly-sweet savory sauce.\\n\\nThe pate plate was good, but suffered the same problem as the pig's tails.  It featured 3 spreads, and each was about 1x1 inch, and about a quarter inch thick... A generous smear on a piece of bread, at best, or two conservative smears.  It had about 16 or so different accouterments, from a variety of pickled products, relishes, prune compote, etc. however there honestly wasn't enough pate to really explore and appreciate the potential pairings.  Delicious, but far too expensive especially with the intention of sharing with even one other person.\\n\\nThe service was not particularly friendly, but very attentive in an odd sort of manner.  They were constantly cleaning our table of crumbs, replacing used utensils with new ones, taking our salt container (without returning it), refreshing our bread (but not our butter).  They were particularly conspicuous in all of these things, and sometimes aggressive (I moved my friend's bread plate toward me, by accident, and before I could correct it my self, an alien hand slipped in and returned it to its proper place in front of my friend).  I cannot say I was a fan of this overly present, yet not-particularly-warm-or-friendly service.\\n\\nSo yes, the food was great, and definitely hard to find comparable fare elsewhere. Some items were worth the price, others not so much.  I know you don't go to Craigie concerned about price, but the service left me baffled and taken aback regarding their refusal to either allow bar food ordered in addition to the dinner menu, or dinner menu accompanying bar food.  \\n\\nSo, in spite of great, high quality fare, using interesting animal parts and a definite curiosity to try a couple more items there, I doubt I will be making too strong a motion to return to Craigie on Main in the near future."},{"name":"Ohlin's Bakery","address":"456 Common St","city":"Belmont","stars":"4","text":"French Toast Bagels!\\nWho does that?\\n\\nHandmade bagels fresh from the kitchen.\\nOften you will be able to get something fresh out of the oven if you go during the first half of the day.\\nThey'll bring it out and ask you if you want to buy whatever the fresh baked thing is.\\n\\nMmmm..doughnut, I mean bagel :)"},{"name":"Sawasdee Thai Food","address":"1401 NW 19 Th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Everyone at this food cart is so friendly!

The food came in record time, about 15 mins when the estimated time was between 25-35 mins so 5 stars for that. The rest is as follows:\\n\\nRibs - pretty good, easily fell of the bone, meaty, fatty but to be expected, sauce was ok but its just my preference that I like sweet bbq sauce like Sweet Baby Ray's. This was more tangy and vinegar based. The meat needed just a tad of salt.\\n\\nShrimp - Perfectly fried, huge shrimp, nice amount of garlic on it. Just needed a tad of salt too.\\n\\nMac n cheese - Also needed a bit of salt but nice and cheesy, ooey, and gooey. Pretty good after adding a smidge of salt. Again, my preference.\\n\\nCollards - For someone who prefers their food a little salty, this was too salty for me.

I found that to be unusual, but lovely.  We specifically mentioned we wanted to try the bone marrow and the pig's head.  Oddly as we looked at the menu forming, we noticed we were eating a large quantity of milk-fed animals... a lesser person would have found it disconcerting, but I assure you it was all delicious!\\n\\nThe pig's head meat was fantastic... very tender with crisp skin (eat it there, do not attempt to eat this later at home...), and the Peking duck treatment was great.  The bone marrow was very good, but I've had a lot of great bone marrow. This one wasn't a magical standout. The ingredient is going to always be good unless it's massacred.\\n\\nThe fish dishes struck me as being excellent.  Delicate enough to taste the quality of the fish, and a nice balance of textures and flavors.

It was there if you needed them, never hovering, casual, informative, and friendly.  They asked us about our wine pairings, and tailored each again to the food and our palates.

The dough was undercooked throughout, resulting in a pasty bottom crust that was not crusty at all and which might have made us sick if we had eaten much of it.  We ended up picking off the toppings with a fork and nibbling on them, leaving behind each slice as a naked triangle of partially raw dough.  But the toppings were no picnic, either.  The so-called \\"meatball\\" topping consisted of chopped squares of something that bore no resemblance -- in appearance or in taste -- to real meat.  Calling this stuff \\"meatball\\" is like calling an etch-a-sketch a Picasso.  I'm sure that this manufactured garbage -- whatever it is -- is a lot cheaper for Pino's to purchase than actual meat, and therefore yields a higher profit margin on each pizza.

We came here with a groupon expiring within a few days and everyone else in the restaurant also had one.  We were seated while a few tables were still empty and it took about 20-25minutes for our entrees to come (a reasonable wait).  The restaurant filled up shortly after we were seated. We were held over by the chips and salsa during our wait.  Server while busy was friendly and professional, something we never found at Zocalo down the street.\\n\\nThe food here is high quality and delicious.  You can tell the kitchen is putting a lot of effort into these dishes.  Everything is plated beautifully and looks appetizing when it comes out.  I had been craving fish tacos for a while and this place nails it. 4 good sized fish tacos with fresh tilapia inside.  They use a Jalapeno beer batter on the fish which is just as delicious as it sounds.  The chipolte aioli on top is the perfect pink sauce to go with the fish taco.  For sides I had beans of the day which were an almost stew like texture and delicious with some grated cheese on top.  The elote (grilled corn, rubbed with spices and cheese) is another side available with your meal and is amazing.  Comes with a stick out of each end so you won't get your hands dirty.  Just try not to squirt corn juice on your date as my fiance did to me.  My fiance had the enchilada de tinga with roja sauce.  The roja sauce was lacking punch, in hindsight she should have had the salsa verde.  The stewed chicken inside the enchilada was flavorful and tender.   She had the rice of the day which had a really good flavor as well, it was poblano pepper rice.  The sides have almost as much care as the entrees and really standout on their own.  These are not your typical rice and beans sides you can get at any Mexican restaurant.  We ended our meal with Tres Leches (cake).  If you like milk and cake (and you should), this is a must order.  This is a great version of the tres leches cake and is plated nicely with strawberries whipped cream and a milk cream sauce pool underneath the cake.  \\n\\nTruly a great experience in Arlington Center and a must try.

As I work a bit far from the 9th and Alder cart pod to get up here regularly on my lunch breaks, it took me a year and a half in town before I got up to Sawasdee. I've sometimes frequented another awesome Thai cart that serves up a fantastic pineapple fried rice, but their pad thai isn't as good -- too sweet, almost gooey. \\n\\nNext time I'm thinking pad thai, I'll be thinking about Sawasdee. I'm not saying it's the best I've ever had, but it's a solid version that hits all the right notes. As my friend said, the sauce is probably from a jar, but it's been doctored up a little. There was a good ratio of all the constituent parts -- chicken, green onions, sprouts, egg, and peanuts -- and a flavor that wasn't overly cloying. Usually after a small portion of pad thai I'm tired of it, but I could've kept eating this stuff all day.

Enough to give it four starts...a fifth could be in the offing at some point if it's as good the next time. Here's why:\\n\\nService: We had a very attentive waiter, not hovering, but friendly and prompt. Food came out promptly, the front staff seated us quickly, the place was immaculate...we couldn't have asked for anything more.\\n\\nThe food: Very fresh, well-cooked, but not overcooked, and a few twists to some traditional items that made them quite tantalizing. Examples: My vanilla french toast was traditional and the vanilla flavor complemented, but did not overwhelm, the meal. Very good. Another of us had the Omelette Basquaise. Priced at 8.95 it fit the dictionary definition of a steal, very fresh, seasoned just enough to bring all of the flavors out without any one surpassing another. Yet another had the warm beet salad, probably the best presented meal of the four and, with its variety of nuts and greens to complement the main ingredient, will be my selection on my next trip.\\n\\nPrice: The prix fixe meal was excellent at $9.95 per person while all of the egg and sandwich selections were far below what one would find in similar restaurants around Boston. Super reasonable.\\n\\nParking isn't the easiest here, but there is valet service...a big plus. A fifth star may be in Aquitaine's future after my next visit.

I have dined at a couple other Olive Gardens in my area, but I must say, this one, overall a good experience, was not impressive or would not draw me to go back. We arrived at about 12-noon on a Sunday and there were seats, literally, everywhere and about 8 other people sitting and waiting to be seated. We were told 10-15 minutes wait time, which we didn't mind, but we couldn't figure out why there were 10 tables in sight open and we had to wait? I've never had an experience like this at any other Olive Garden before at the same times. The next couple of people that came in after us also remarked on why the wait with all the empty tables? I guess in my opinion, if you're going to be open, you better be ready to fill the place up. The girl in charge of seating arrangements seemed very confused and unsure of how to work the whole system and even 2 coworkers couldn't be any help to her. They were all pretty monotone, didn't seem to have any personality to them.\\n\\nWe only ended up waiting about 5 minutes for a table, so that was good. The waitress was good, she wasn't overly impressive by any means, just standard and organized, I guess. She didn't have much personality, but she didn't mess anything up either and was right on top of our refills. We were given 2 breadsticks to start with, which we thought was unusual considering at any other Olive Garden we've eaten at, we've always been given 4 and then an additional 4 after those were gone. But we were given 2 to start and then 2 after that. The salad was delicious, we both really enjoyed our food.

I've been in Buckhead for some time and know the drill but this isn't high-end upscale dinning so do I need to be charged inside and outside the place?  Anyway the wait on a Friday night [20 minutes] wasn't too bad so I can't complain there. We went straight to the hibachi side.  We've eaten hibachi all over including outside of the country.  We spent the typical length of time from sit-down, cook, jokes, and eating. The overall presentation was good; I guess that part that fell flat with me was the amount of food received and quality/taste.  Usually when I get hibachi I have so much food I have to get a box and I'm usually eating it days after for lunch, etc. The portions here were much smaller and I actually finished my plate. I looked around and most of the people had finished their plates as well so I knew it wasn't just me.  Now what ties to that directly to me is the price.  If I'm paying the same price for meals in higher end places I expect things to line up.  If I'm paying a lower price and I'm getting less food or lower quality that makes sense but that's not what's going on here.

We decided on this place, because frankly we didn't want to wait 5 hours for BBQ at another famous spot. The wait here was less than 30 minutes and you can go anytime since they are open until 9pm, once again unlike its competitor.\\n\\nIt's a very unique dining experience. You pick up a pager from the Check In booth and then a pager from the Pager booth. We were told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes, but we really waited about 25 minutes for dinner at 4:30 pm (not bad!). While we waited, we went to the Salt Lick Cellar to get some beer and wine. They also have a BYOB policy, so you can bring your own stuff. They were also serving popcorn and lemonade near the live music area.\\n\\nAt the Salt Lick Cellar, they have their own vineyard where the make their wines from. I got a tasting of 5 wines (chardonnay,  moscato, red wine, sparkling wine and dessert wine. My favorites were the red, dessert, and chardonny, in that order. In the end, I opted for a white sangria, which was good but unfortunately watered down due to the ice. Soon after our drinks, our pager rang.\\n\\nWe were seated in a family style table with no other party. My friend and I ordered the combo, which you get to pick 2 meats. We opted for the pork ribs and the brisket. My friend's boyfriend got the family style buffet, which is $21 for unlimited portions of pork ribs, sausage, brisket and sides. Just the first serving was so much food, he couldn't finish the second serving. They were nice and let him take it home.\\n\\nThe pork ribs were really good,  very flavorful and meaty. The brisket was pretty good as well. Unfortunately,  it wasn't quite as good as the hype, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. This is supposed to be the original go-to place for BBQ, but their brisket wasn't tender enough nor was it that flavorful.  I actually had to pour some of their BBQ sauce (which was great) on it. Also, the ribs did not \\"fall off the bone\\" so to speak. Supposedly, the sausage was really good. My friend's boyfriend said je liked the ribs, then the sausage, then the brisket.\\n\\nAs far as sides go, they aren't that great. In fact, that was one of the worst coleslaws I have ever had. I opted not to get the beans, but my friends said they were terrible. In fact, I quote, \\"I would rather have canned beans than it this\\". We all agreed their potato salad was good. I don't know if I would call this potato salad, because it is more like mashed potato.\\n\\nBut overall, I would highly recommend this place. The food is good and you're sure to have a good time.

She told me how great the food is and I saw the reviews were generally favorable on Yelp.  Walked in, and we were greeted right away and sat in a small cozy booth. The restaurant was charming, small, and would make a great date spot.  Our waiter came and offered us a drink.  I decided on a martini.  When it arrived, it came in such a tiny little martini glass.  I was shocked that for $10, it wasn't a bigger glass.  We were served some bread with olive oil and balsamic.  Bread was pretty good, soft inside with a crusty outside.  We were only given 3 pieces, and the waiter just took the empty bread basket away without asking if we wanted more.  We started with the roasted brussel sprouts, which came with a fried egg.  Sounded interesting, and it did complement the brussel sprouts.  They were nicely crisp with good flavor to them.  Next, I had to decide on entree. I picked the description with goat filled pasta with carmelized onions and kale.  Sounded good, until the waiter told me the goat is so good.  Confused, I asked,..you mean goat cheese, right?  He said no, goat!  Like goat meat!  I said....oh no!  Can't do that.  So decided on a simple ravioli with marinara.  I asked since I saw another pasta dish with spicy marinara, if I could have the sauce spicy.  I was told immediately no.  Very curt.  Then I asked if I could have the carmelized onions and kale on top of my dish.  \\"No.\\" I could understand if the restaurant were slammed, but we were one of three tables there.  So Kate had told me the cheese they serve is the small pieces like you'd see from a Kraft container, so I asked if we could have shaved cheese.  He said, \\"I know what you mean.  I do it that way at home, but no.\\"  So the ravioli actually was incredibly bland, and the sauce was just as unmemorable.   On the last piece, the waiter actually brought out some crushed red pepper after I mentioned it would have been better if it had some spice.  Dessert we split was a gelato type pie with a cookie crust and chocolate topped with black cherries on top.  That actually was very good.

There was no wait, but the place was just about full with a few \\"bar\\" seats open so we sat there. The bar is not an actual bar, but rather bar style seating overlooking the cooks and the main ramen kitchen area. I've heard the wait can get pretty long, and I'm sure that's also the case when there are events at Brighton Music Hall which is directly across the street.\\n\\nThe menu has a few appetizers (kimchee, fried chicken, pork buns, etc.) and about eight ramen dishes in total. I ordered the spicy ramen extra spicy so essentially I was getting extra spicy, spicy ramen. The spicy ramen is $12 and you can do extra spicy on any ramen for an extra $2. There are a ton of toppings you can choose from and they range from $1-$2. I'm glad I did it extra spicy because it was still not extremely spicy (my level of desired spice is ghost chili). The broth was DELICIOUS. They do paitan style broth which is thicker, but not creamy. The noodles are not overcooked and they give you a generous portion. I also added corn and fried garlic to my dish. I changed out the char pork for char chicken. The meat is cooked to perfection and compliments the soup quite well. You can see the chefs charring the meat with a torch right in front of your eyes. Cool!\\n\\nThere seemed to be one girl who was the greeter/server/busser all in one. She took a few minutes to take our orders, but since the broth and meat is constantly being made, and the toppings continuously being prepped, the food came out somewhere over 5 minutes, but under 10. People were in and out of there so fast so no one needed to wait for tables or bar seats. We were there for less than an hour, maybe even under 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe other people in my party also loved their ramen. My Mom had the Mega Paitan which is a bigger version of the chicken paitan. It also has a lot more toppings and a variety of meat.

When my \\"Chinese\\" meal came out, I was surprised at the Thai flair it had. The chicken wasn't the thick tender morsels that one typically gets at a chinese restaurant. It was thin slices lightly fried. While typically Thai sweet and sour chicken isn't fried, the cut of chicken is the same. The chinese fried rice was very similar to Thai fried rice, and had the green onions, and tomatoes that is traditional to Thai fried rice. My one major complaint is that the portions are pretty small. I don't eat a lot so they were fine for me, but for the average person, I'd say they'd be quite disappointed at the lunch portions. For dessert, I ordered the Mangoes and Sticky Rice and Coconut Ice Cream. That was the most expensive part of the meal as I had to order the ice cream separate.

One of my dinner guests has frequented the Porter and upon me asking about the black bean burger he said it was good, but not your typical black bean burger--that it's softer. Well, in my opinion that meant that it wasn't one of those hard as a rock patties that Boca makes, but an organic patty with black bean and miscellaneous vegetable chunks. Nope, not at all. I ordered the burger and a side salad. Salad was great, arugula, beets, nuts, and a heaping lump of goat cheese. But the burger, welp, it had the exact same texture as the goat cheese, it was a paste.

Razor-thin with ample portions of pepperoni, cheese, and tomato sauce, I couldn't get enough of this. I think the key to getting a good slice at Pino's is to go simple. Forget all the artisan toppings, it's pepperoni and cheese, thats it!\\n\\nThe Sicilian slice was certainly not to my liking. Thickly cut, lacking in sauce, cheese and a goey texture. What is with Boston? The only thin Sicilian I had here was at Umberto's. Do people not realize that with thick cuts you need to adjust by adding way more sauce and cheese?

Each time I came up with the same conclusion: I love Sea Thai. \\n\\nNow the first time I went, we ordered the Chicken Satay, which comes out on a little charcoal fire pit, so you can sort of continue cooking skewers on your own. They are already cooked (don't want anyone getting sick from not cooking them enough lol) but you get to give them a little extra color, and it makes for a nice conversation piece for a date. My boyfriend ordered the Chili Jam as an entree, and it was fantastic. It was spicy, fresh, and just fantastic. I ordered the Massaman Curry, and I was slightly disappointed. I am not really faulting Sea Thai for this; it is just that it was waaaay too sweet and rich for my tastes. I have read that a lot of people like it, so I am thinking they tweaked the traditional recipe for American tastes. The traditional Massaman I had in Asia was a bit lighter, not as sweet, and spicier.\\n\\nThe second and third time I dined at Sea Thai, I ordered a dish I discovered in Vegas, Mee Grob/Mee krob (spelling differs from place to place). It is a light noodle that is fried and crispy, then drizzled with a tamarind sauce and sprinkled with cashews. I am obsessed with it, and Sea Thai has a very delicious version. The only slight issue I had is that they don't drizzle the sauce on the noodles, but sort of doused them in sauce. That leaves the noodles soggy pretty quickly. But the flavor was fantastic, so I can deal with it. :) \\n\\nMy boyfriend is stuck on the Chili Jam, which he got the second and third time we dined at Sea Thai. He gets the combo of beef, chicken and pork (such a carnivore!) I decided to go with my new favorite dish, Green Curry. I asked for an 8 on the heat scale, and it was pretty good.

Luckily I still had the email with my reservation confirmation as the hostess checking us in seemed unable to find it and didn't seem very excited to seat us though there were several empty tables both inside and outside.  Our server was much more friendly and welcoming and we had a nice meal. If you like Irish food, there are a lot of choices on the menu to fit your taste. My one tip would be to view the menu before going to make sure there is something you would enjoy. I had the risotto with chicken which was very good and very filling. \\nThe entertainment is really cool with Irish musicians and dancers.

There isn't a big bright sign on the outside, so you might have trouble finding it. The parking lot is unpaved but spacious and I didn't have trouble finding a spot. There was a wine \\"cellar\\" where they sell wine and beer and other things I weren't able to eye because it was too packed full of people to move around. We only stepped in to keep warm. There was a black cat munching on dry catfood outside this little building.\\n\\nThere was a man playing guitar and singing in the outside area where people seemed to roam around in every direction. There were outdoor heaters but none of them seemed to work.\\n\\nThe first stop is check-in, where I was given a pager shaped like a coaster. The nice girl working check-in told me it was going to be an hour and fifteen minutes and when the thing buzzed, we would enter the closer building. I never got a look in the other building, so it might be different.\\n\\nIt is a half hour drive to Driftwood, so we were committed to eating, despite the wait. Because of the aforementioned heaters and wine cellar, I started my car engine so I could run the heat. I played sudoku while my friend entered a somewhat meditative state. The wait was only about 35-45 minutes when the thing lit up and vibrated. There's a pretty good range on the coasters.\\n\\nWe were seated by a young waitress named Kaylee. She was nice and attentive and we gave her a nice tip. The inside has a nice meat smell to it. The atmosphere doesn't feel like a restaurant. The noise from the large, packed room on top of wooden tables and benches made it seem like a kids' camp cafeteria. Everyone has to speak louder in order to hear one another. There are no booths, but the seating wasn't uncomfortable. On our table, there were two sauces, one with a red lid and one with a black lid. I assume they're the same. There was a bowl full of margarine spread cups (yuck) by a tall stack of disposable napkins. There was also a small container full of various sweetener packets. It wasn't cold inside.\\n\\nA separate server, didn't get his name, took drink orders. I ordered a Coke and she a water. She told me it tasted like bleach. I could smell it, but it tasted fine to me. Maybe that's just what Texas tap water is like. She then ordered a Coke.\\n\\nOn the specials menu, my friend wanted to order the prime rib and I wanted the au gratin, but they were out of both. Guess you need to show up early if you want to try most of the specials.\\n\\nMy friend ordered beef ribs and I ordered the sampler plate called The Rancher. The wait was about 15 minutes. The plate they used for me was way too small. Try to imagine a pork sausage, a pork rib, two thick slices of chicken, two thick slices of beef brisket, beans, coleslaw and potato salad on one round 12 inch plate. It is the San Francisco of plates, stacked vertically in a small space. It was difficult to work a knife and fork there, especially if the knife is dull and would normally be used for buttering bread. They'd be in serious trouble if it didn't taste absolutely excellent.\\n\\nKaylee gave me Coke refills regularly. Refills are free, so there's no reason to mind the excess ice. When we were finished, my friend wanted an espresso, but they only served regular and decaf coffee.\\n\\nThe room roared with a rendition of Happy Birthday To You at one point. They didn't do anything special like forcing their poor servers to dance, if you were wondering.\\n\\nWhile my friend was waiting to pay the check at the cashier (cash only, which stinks), I went to the restroom to do some evacuating. There were a few urinals but only ONE toilet, which was occupied. Two kids were throwing balled up paper towels at each other in there. After a minute or so, I gave up and went to another bathroom that was around the corner outside. There were two toilets in there, thankfully. I have to hope the wet fluid I stepped on in there is mud from earlier rain.\\n\\nSo, overall, is it worth it? Well, if all you care about is really good food, excellent service and somewhat affordable prices, absolutely. The experience leaves so much to be desired, though. There is so much land they could use to remodel into a larger space to accommodate more people in a nicer, more comfortable setting, not to mention a larger bathroom (a must if they're going to fill stomachs with pounds and pounds of meat). More variety in the sides they serve would be nice as well. The potato salad is good, but I'm not really a fan of crunchy onions. They just don't serve fries, mashed potatoes or anything. Even some tater tots would be good.\\n\\nBut it's unlikely anything is going to change. They are way too busy and successful to have to change anything. Only competition offering equal food and a superior dining experience can change this. So if find yourself in a better barbecue restaurant, be sure to Yelp and visit often. Light a fire under Salt Lick's ass so their food gets the restaurant it deserves."},{"name":"SOHO Restaurant","address":"4300 Paces Ferry Rd SE, Ste 107","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I ate here with clients and the food and service was phenomenal!\\nHighly recommend the sea bass!\\nGreat atmosphere!"},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My cousin and I stopped in here on a rainy night to share a pizza and appetizer.

The place is not huge, but modern, clean with roughly 7-8 tables with a few booth sitting. They do accommodate large parties...while we were there there was a party of at least a dozen.\\n\\nThe menu had good variety from Japanese to Vietnamese foods...pho, steaks, noodles, salads, soups, and sushi (sashimi, nigiri, & specialty rolls). Since we came for sushi, we ended ordering the Carnage, Mr Fancy, & Philly roll (philly roll was not on their regular menu, but they made it for my friend anyways). They were all tasty and fresh.

Over this time, business has picked up there substantially. Now if you come in on a Saturday or Sunday morning, there is generally a pretty long wait if you'd like to get a table. If you plan on camping out there for a while with a book or work, it's better to get a seat at the bar or at the communal table in the back section. Otherwise, if you sit at a table, they will eventually rush you out if you do not continue to order food. I understand that's how the business goes, but much prefer the relaxed Euro-style cafe, where you can laze away the whole day if you want without being bothered. Trident is NOT that, unless you seat at the communal table or the bar, in which case no one will bother you. \\n\\nThe food is normally good, though nothing phenomenal. Some of my favorite dishes are the butternut squash ravioli (I think they only have this in the fall...) and the fresh fruit cobbler (every time I order this, inevitably the person sitting next to me will ask, \\"Ooh...what did you get there? It looks great.\\" It is.) \\n\\nOne thing Trident certainly has going for it is the general atmosphere, which is in part a result of the mix people that come here and in part because of the combination bookstore--cafe concept, which Trident pulls off exceptionally well."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Beautiful Irish Pub atmosphere.

The experience was all right, and I will go back if my friends really want to, but I wasn't impressed. My first impression was that the decor of the restaurant is unique and interesting. Unfortunately, the ambiance was somewhat marred by the loud noise in the dining room, which made it difficult to carry on a conversation with all of my friends. The music wasn't too loud-the volume was mostly voices. \\n\\nOur servers were friendly, but they were either bumbling or dishonest. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and made it clear that it was to serve four people. One of our servers brought out the pitcher, poured the entire pitcher into three glasses, and then asked if we wanted to order another pitcher or a glass for the fourth person. We had to pour from glass to glass ourselves to make up the fourth glass. The server didn't apologize or offer to help. The sangria itself was average. We didn't try the margaritas, so I can't comment on them.\\n\\nWe ordered the fresh guacamole and chips. The guac was good, but not as flavorful as others that I've had (not enough garlic, in my opinion). The chips had a unique flavor. A friend asked for jalepenos on the side, but even the peppers were't very hot. After we finished our guac, a server asked if we wanted salsa, but neglected to mention that there would be a surcharge for it. I don't mind paying for things, but I do like to be informed about it in advance-especially when it's an item that is often complimentary. Look out for other surprise surcharges-a friend mentioned that they were charged for sitting outside on the patio on a previous visit! \\n\\nMost of us ordered tacos, and we were not impressed. They're not bad, but nothing to rave about. My chorizo taco was good, but no different from any other chorizo taco. I was really curious about the mushroom and cheese taco, but again, nothing about it was unique. The pork taco had the most interesting flavor, with a hint of cinnamon. One person ordered loaded nachos, and was impressed with both the size of the portion and the taste.\\n\\nIf you happen to be near Restaurant Row and you need a more affordable, casual place to eat dinner, Rocco's is an option.

That paper is not sanitary people!\\n\\nFood:\\nI ordered the scrambled eggs plate and my girlfriend had an egg white omelet. The scrambled eggs were over cooked and dry, the home fries are extremely over seasoned, and the omelet had way to much unmelted cheese in it which is just gross in my opinion.\\n\\nPrice:\\nOk seriously this is breakfast, it should be the cheapest and easiest meal of the day, in my opinion. Why is it that the scrambled egg plate comes with an english muffin, home fries for about $9. Then an omelet, which uses the same amount eggs, costs the same but does not come with anything but toast, AND I have to pay for the cheese?? An omelet by definition is suppose to come with at least cheese isn't it?\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nI love the concept of having the restaurant inside a bookstore. However, I feel the execution is lacking. Why do you have a wall separating the two? I think you're losing sales opportunities and making your atmosphere feel way too blocked off. As someone who loves books, if I can sit and enjoy breakfast while looking at a table of newly released books, I can almost guarantee you that I will get up from my table and check out the new books, and will most likely buy one if I like it. Instead you have a wall completely blocking me from the books, and the path to leave the restaurant is a direct path to leave the entire shop.

My roommates and I just feel finished day one of moving into our new place and decided to get some beers and food. Sure we looked a little rugged but it's not like we smelled or had dirt on our bodies. However, we were sure treated like it possibly worse. Server took about 6 mins to greet our table and take drink orders. Once our drinks came we ordered our food. I started with asking for nachos with cheese and sour cream on the side, one of my roommates is lactose intolerant and I was being considerate so he can still snack on something until our food came. The nachos came out at the same time as our food did. Cheese and sour cream was on the side but the plate of nachos still had cheese all over.  And it's was hardly warm cheese, you know that phase in a cheese life that you can almost mold like play dough. I should have canceled those stinkin nachos but my inner hunger couldn't let go since it took forever to get them in the first place. The philly was also ordered without cheese and had to have been sent back. It came back without cheese fairly quickly but they let the fried sit there and get colder. They were at least a little warm (just like the other two plates) when they came out the first time. Now that we are done with our food the server comes to ask if we want another round of beers and we do but are taking a look at the list to change it up. I noticed that they have a double happy hour starting in 4 mins so kindly ask our server if he would be willing to ring in the order and honor the HH prices. He said he would ask his manager since it was so close and came back 2 mins after the designated HH time and said their computers have a slow clock and are actually showing 6 mins till HH and asked if we still want to wait because it's \\"only going to save us like a dollar\\" and I said yes please. Then I asked if he told his manager how he messed up our order and he just laughed like it wasn't a big deal to have great customer service in such an establishment. He walked away to wait for the computer clock to hit HH time. We decided that this was getting uncomfortable for us and didn't feel as if we were welcomed nor willing to serve us. I walked over to him at the computer and handed him my card to cancel the 6 min beer wait for the next round and close out. He came back with only the credit card receipts leaving out the itemized receipt, weird. I had to ask for it because at this rate I may have been charged for something I didn't order. Trust is out the door. I got it and then many stares across the restaurant from the manager (big bald guy) the server explaining the situation and bartender (female) who had to here what's going on at table 32.

I'm sitting in the middle of the main dining area, in a booth facing the bar, and in my direct view, without turning my head more than 90 degrees in either direction, I can easily see 16 tv's displaying a whopping 8 different sports channels. There is also another 6 tv's behind me with 2 additional channels. The final tv is a MASSIVE HD screen from a projector, right in the middle of 6 of the aforementioned screens.

Chip and drink refill was a tad slow considering they aren't swamped, not a big issue though. \\n\\nThe drink menu is pretty extensive for a sports bar, with some mixed beer drinks being offered that I took advantage of. I got the Cider House Bat, which is Leprechaun Cider with a shot of raspberry liquor served over ice. At least that's what I ordered.

Did I mention it was opening night? She did say they'd had a friends & family night the weekend before, so we cut her some slack.\\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of red wine and it came out colder than fridge-cold. Our server didn't give us a taste, just poured us big glasses. After realizing it was chilly, we sent it back. The manager came out with a different bottle, explaining that the other bottle had been in the wine cellar. Um, isn't that supposed to keep it the right temperature? There was no apology. She did offer a new bottle that was \\"in the same price range,\\" and we liked it, so we went with it.\\n\\nI don't recall everything we ordered, but nothing jumped out at us as great. We both felt it was very overpriced for the quality of the food. They forgot one of our tapas and brought it out after we reminded them, and at that point were done eating everything else. The server acted like that was intentional, but I'm pretty sure it was just forgotten.\\n\\nI do remember getting the fries (meh) and asking for some extra aioli dipping sauce. When our bill came, we saw that they charged us $1 for the aioli, and the wine was $4 more than the original bottle we ordered.\\n\\nNow, it's not like we can't afford $5.00 between us, but we were fired up on principle. Good service could have made up for mediocre, overpriced food, but instead, excuses and poor service just added to our disappointment.

At 7:30, the restaurant called to confirm we were coming, and when I explained to them the situation, they said not to worry and that they would hold our table until we got here. Wow!!!\\nAnd they did. We were quickly seated in this very small restaurant and bar, and drinks were brought out very quickly - the revelry old fashioned was great. We later switched to the GT&T - a gin and tonic with a dash of tamarind, cinnamon, cloves, and a chili - incredibly refreshing and a must try.\\nFor the menu, all the dishes are a wonderful play of sweet and sour, with layers of smokiness and heat. I recommend you order several dishes and share!\\n\\nFor appetizers, we had the fish and chips, the charred eggplant, the aguachile, and the falafel. All were incredibly flavorful. The fish and chips is a take on the Korean dried fish that you usually start with, and so much more fun with crunchy kettle chips. The aguachile was by far my favorite. A take on the traditional Mexican dish, several plump shrimp sat on top of a cake, with kale, and a yummy child oil. A must try!! The charred eggplant was a delightful contrast since it was a cold appetizer and the citrus of the orange cut through the Chinese Sausage and complemented the charred eggplant which had also been pickled - a nice palate cleanser in between the appetizer and the mains.\\n\\nSo the mains....ms yang's fried chicken was tender, and who doesn't want peanut brittle with their chicken. The Dan Dan noodles with Dungeness crab were tantalizing to the tastebuds. The green curry, the hand cut noodles, played off the sweetness of the crab. We also orders the jackfruit pancake, which really highlighted the jackfruit - it's savory, rather than sweet - so be ready. The rice bowl with the short rib was a little bit of a disappointment because it had the least amount of flavor. I think the rice just overwhelmed the other ingredient based on the proportions.

We made reservations for 7pm, arrived on time but the restaurant was packed. We were told 15 min wait so we waited and waited. The only thing they needed to do was put a reserved sign on a table they didn't. 30 min passed, no table, we were ready to leave by 45min (earlier but mixed group and it was hard for all of us to meet up again) and 50min later we were finally getting seated. 1:15min we finally got water. \\nWhy the 4 stars? They were very apologetic and tried hard to remedy the situation. We appreciate that the restaurant is still relatively newish and mistakes happen. They upgraded our lambchops to rack of lamb (unfortunately it was poorly cut and very hard to eat) and treated us to nice dessert. If our reservations had been honored, it would have been a wonderful evening. The flavors and presentation of dishes is excellent.

And--what a concept--a Sand Lake Road restaurant that takes advantage of the lake view! The food is good, not necessarily inventive or inspired. There are the usual Americanized taco and enchilada offerings, but some of the stuffings are quite tasty. I particularly liked the seasoned pork. They also have several kinds of Molcajete, which you don't see in that many Mexican restaurants in Orlando. Molcajete actually means mortar and pestle, but on menus it's a sort of stew served in a pot that usually looks nothing like a mortar. It is quite succulent. Table-side guacamole is a very generous serving, and contains a tremendous amount of lime juice, the predominant flavor. The tortilla chips are very heavily seasoned, which makes it a bit hard to tell what the guacamole tastes like. A couple of tacos at $4 each make a reasonable lunch, so it's not as expensive as that neat decor might suggest. Add on that table-side guacamole and some drinks, though, and it's not the cheapest Mexican restaurant in town."},{"name":"Mozart's Bakery & Piano Cafe","address":"2885 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I really like the atmosphere in this place.

I would be fine with getting my own food from the window, and bussing my own plates. It could be that the cashier was just extra friendly.\\n\\nAmid a town overrun with hipster kitsch and wanna-be-like-New-York-but-ends-up-more-like-Dallas joints, I hope this new place gets the chance it deserves.\\n\\nnb: It's in the shopping center at the SE corner of South Cong. & Oltorf - NOT on S.

Sitting in the back, watching them make my pizza made it even more authentic feeling. Also, i would advise getting there early. When my friend and i went, we got lucky and had a seat right away. 5 mins later there was a line out the door.\\n\\nThe pizza itself was amazing. Fresh and natural ingredients and the most flavorful chilies(i think?) i've ever had. We had the Divaola, which was amazing, and the group next to us insisted we try their San Gennaro, which i think may have been even better. There is also a monster pizza, which is four pizzas in one.

The couple of pros are FAR outweighed by the cons.\\n\\nPROS: Lots of TV's. Some or all in hi-def. The wings were ok. Bloody mary was pretty good.\\n\\nCONS: Mostly booth seating which makes it hard to see what you want to see if it's only on one or two TV's. And this is tight booth seating - beer-guts need not apply. We asked to have just one measly TV in my line of vision turned to the game which had LOCAL HEROES Colt McCoy and Jordan Shipley playing. Could they accommodate? HELL NO. Without comment or apology, they refused. With over 20 televisions, only two had that game on, and neither of them were within my sight-line. We called in advance to make sure they'd have the game on, and they said they would. The TV we asked to have changed was not playing a game that wasn't already playing on several other TV's on every wall. And it wasn't a local game or anything. And NO ONE ELSE WAS LOOKING AT IT. NOT ONE OTHER PERSON.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, the food sucked. The wings were ok, but the burger was blah, the onion rings were awful (and really pricey - about a dollar a ring - $4 for a TINY portion of flattened, soggy rings), and they couldn't quite get an order right. The bf ordered a burger with no sauces, just on the side, and they delivered it with mayo and mustard. He hates mayo. So they took it back and took the rings with it, and didn't freshen them up, so they were nasty and cold by the time they brought the burger back. I think they would have been equally nasty warm, though. And who sells a burger with NO sides? $6.50 for a crappy burger with no sides is overpriced.\\n\\nWe will NOT go back.

I forgot to mention in my original review that I was there watching one of the first rounds of the NBA playoffs, not the finals. They definitely did NOT have their shit down last week during Game 1. \\n\\nSo I get there about 20 minutes before the game starts, and ask the hostess for a table. She says there will be a 2 hour wait, meaning that there won't be any tables until AFTER the game, and suggested going elsewhere. It didn't seem rude, and it made sense, so I decided I would leave, but  I was expecting two friends so I waited for them to get there. The hostess stand has a television above it, and directly across from that is a section of four tables. One couple was sitting at a table, in the same predicament, so I sat there as well. Three guys come in and ask for a table, but the hostess encourages them to put their name on a list, saying it won't take long. She continues with the same pattern. I decided to put my name on the list anyway. The second quarter is halfway through when my first friend met up with me.\\n\\nThe bar situation was awful. I totally understand that they were busy, but one bartender was wearing an open back dress and had her bottle opener stashed in the top of her underwear. The other one was running back and forth, carrying receipts in her mouth. Not joking. After getting eye raped by a patron sitting at the bar, I finally got our drinks, and she automatically cashed me out and gave me a pen, straight from her mouth. I was pretty grossed out. I think it's common sense to not put your working tools in your bodily orifices. \\n\\nMy second friend was on the bus and almost there. Tables were actually leaving, so when a table of three opened up, one of the guys in the section I was in asked if they could sit there (I was above him on the list, though). I overheard that, saw that she was getting menus ready for them, and went up to the stand to ask her about it. She said \\"well, your whole party isn't here.\\" I had my phone in hand and said my friend was right outside, and she said \\"are you SURE he's really here?\\" and gave me a pretty condescending look. Luckily he walked in right at that time, and she reluctantly sat us. This was towards the end of the third quarter.\\n\\n4 minutes are left in the fourth quarter before a server (Evan. He was my server during the superbowl and generally doesn't seem like he's able to handle game night service) acknowledges us. Actually, he didn't acknowledge us, and I had to wave my arm to get him to see that he had a new table. It then took 10 minutes to get the first drink. We don't see him again for a while. My friend asked another server for a drink, and she got mad that he asked her. Evan comes back over and says, \\"hey, just so you know, my name is Evan, and I'm your guy. You can order drinks from me.\\" \\n\\nAnd wait until the game is literally over?\\n\\nWhich is what happened. My friend got a drink AFTER the game was over.\\n\\nTo top it all off, we had told him that was our last round. He doesn't come back with a check for about 15 minutes. I could see him counting his tips at a POS in the corner of the restaurant. If we had wanted to, we could have left without paying, and he wouldn't have noticed until long after we were gone. \\n\\nOverall, it's an average place. I don't recommend it for high profile games, though."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I'm surprised that I'm actually giving this a 5 because 5's are hard to come by in my book, especially if the BBQ isn't that great.

My friend and I took 2 friends that came in from out of town, and loaded up some beer.  It's a nice scenic drive to this country joint that sits all alone.  It has huge field parking, and you wait for your table in this little crowded canopy.  It's very rustic.  Once people order, most decide to go with the \\"family-style\\" which is basically unlimited refills on whatever you want.  A great $19 buy.  Too bad they only offer sausage, ribs, and brisket.  The sides are amazing though.  Beans are nice and salty; cole slaw doesn't have too much mayonnaise; bread is good; and the \\"potato\\" salad is a bit different than your everyday salad.  Ribs are great here, though the cut is a bit odd.  They use different sizes of spare ribs.  Sausage is ok at best, and brisket is good, but some cuts are very chewy and gristly.  The sauce smothered on top is pretty good, but pretty sweet.  The habanero BBQ sauce is a much better choice, as it is something really different with a slight kick.

Think they felt bad for not understanding the situation and were nice the rest of the trip but had heaven not saved me based only on the front desk it would have been a 1 star experience) \\n\\nI was given my key and a dolly to haul up about 200 lbs of equipment. It was weird the staff at the front desk didn't assist with bags. (Staff always assists with bags anywhere I stay). I finally manage to drag everything upstairs (keep in mind I'm using a dolly NOT a typical cart). \\n\\nI found my room (named Cry Baby which I found ironic since I'm totally being a cry baby about it) and I'm greeted with a dark hotel room, a sink, weird mismatched lamps, crack in the ceiling, light bulb out. I literally threw my bags in and slammed the door because I was late shaking my head thinking wtf where am I and laughing. \\n\\nSo I go pick up my friend we have a few drinks at this point after traveling for 2 days hauling 200 lbs across many state lines and a lack of sleep I had two glasses of wine and got a little exhausted drunk. (Someone tell me if exhausted drunk is the worst or best- I can't decide- but you all know what I'm referring to right??) anyway I go back to my room later that night and again think \\"what the actual fuck is this place I can't believe I'm in such a shit hole\\" so I decide to roam the hotel and check it out. \\n\\nHave you ever seen American horror story?  The season with the hotel?? Yep I think it's filmed here. Hallways in places that don't belong so fourth. Anyway I go down to the basement and it's like an amazing maze and I question if I've been drugged and am seeing things. I'm wandering through different bars in the basement and find the \\"soaking tub\\". OMG I'm intrigued and amazed at this place now. I finally \\"get it\\" this isn't a hotel. This is a god damn experience. It's a destination. So I go grab my bikini and go into the most AMAZING warn relaxing soaking pool I've ever been in. \\n\\nAfter I finally realize that this is not exactly a hotel- it's something else entirely I get back to my room and actually appreciate the place. It's not a shit hole like o first thought it's the weirdest coolest bizarre and probably haunted hotel. \\n\\nOk so major pros: it is so centrally located that you can go anywhere in the city easily by hopping on the max. It's next to everything. Huge plus and the reason I choose this hotel vs other options I was given. Free coffee in the am. Again the location (can't stress that enough) and it's just a weird quirky place. I've never had a shared bathroom and was not into the idea but I was happily surprised that it was clean and never really occupied when I wanted to shower. Once you get that isn't a hotel so don't expect hotel service, rooms, anything else that would normally go with a hotel it's the coolest weirdest experience ever. \\n\\nCons- like I said earlier the staff was not great until Heaven stepped in. If you're expecting to stay in a hotel don't stay here. I did question the cleanliness of this place but I was too exhausted the entire trip to even care. Street noise but I didn't care because hello I'm staying in downtown but be warned if you want a quiet place this isn't for you. Next and final cry baby con is for the love of god if you see someone struggling at check in and check out with bags please help them. \\n\\nOver all I will absolutely stay here again and it has become my new hotel- I fly back at least once a year if not more and this is my new spot. Why after all this? Because now I know it's not a hotel and I won't have hotel expectations. It's location and total weirdness make up for all the cons. I think it should be reclassified as something else such as hotel/hostel/weird haunted building so you're not expecting to stay at a hotel. \\n\\nSo I'm rating it 4 stars because the pics didn't give me a good understanding of what I was walking into- I wish I knew before I checked in so I didn't have any unreal expectations of the place. I can't rate it any higher because again- this isn't like a hotel I would rate 5 stars."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Orlando East Colonial","address":"2600 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"A great place to come and sit at the outside bar and have some really good food.

When we tried to ask Debbie the hostess that is it $5 or $10, she's like \\"it's always been $10\\" ok no problem, $5 won't make anyone rich or poor. \\nThen she seats us right next to this big group, while the whole restaurant was empty, when we asked to move, the waiter was kind enough & moved us away to another table. We were told that \\"she assumed we were with the other group\\" Now why the hell (I wish I could curse here) would she assume that - bimbo. No wonder she's a hostess & not a waitress or a bartender. \\nAbout the food. We were kind of decided on what we wanted to eat, so my gf ordered the ravioli with was not out of the ordinary - it didn't seem like there was much effort put into it, I ordered the chicken limoncello without capers - there was capers when it was bought to the table, the asparagus was undercooked & the sauce was very tart. The waiter did offer to bring out a new one but I didn't want my gf's food to get cold or have her eat alone not that she would have. \\nOh btw, we ordered a mojito - practically 1/2 oz of rum & too much lime, ordered another one thinking it would be better - same thing. Finally the desert arrived which the waiter recommended, it was good. \\nKeep in mind, the service was great no question, the waiter got tipped 20% but the food - average. We also got their Special pasta - Strega Togo, still have to try that, will update the review later. Although the chicken limoncello was taken off the check, the food wasn't worth $115.00.

Ceiling is high so it makes the space feel even roomier. \\n\\nSecondly, drinks, I tried the French Chameleon which is def a summer drink with a little bit of soda taste to it; the taste is a bit fruity and on the sweeter side.

I got the Salty Pig part (see pictures) with smoked beef tongue, crottin cheese, and jalapeno jelly, along with pickles and mustard and bread of course. the food is nicely presented. Bread is my most favorite part as they are crunchy, buttery, and a little bit honey - this delicious bread is what seals everything else together. The smoked beef tongue and cheese go really well together.

Many of the dishes have interesting combinations that suffer a bit from execution. For instance, pistachio- and herb-crusted tofu had a coating, but it wasn't cooked to actually form a crust (more of a mush). Like many vegan restaurants, there seems to be the need to overcompensate (?) by making the dishes very complicated. Service was friendly, though a tad slow. Then again, it was a busy Friday night. The cauliflower appetizer with Indian flavors was very, very good. Vegan Caesar salad was okay, but didn't seem worth the price (again, overly complicated with non-Caesar flavors). Millet loaf was a bit heavy (maybe that should have been predictable). Overall, definitely worth a visit. A tiny bit expensive for the experience, but will certainly go again.

Pal Campo was the choice of the day after a long afternoon of shopping and walking around in the exhaustive Florida heat of August.  When we arrived, they asked if we had reservations and unfortunately we didn't know that it was needed.  It was busy inside, where the large dining area was located, but the bar section had few customers, so we thought sitting at the bar would be nice to cool off with a drink and relax while we waited for a table to open.  Joe also asked for a glass of ice water because the heat was really hitting him hard.  \\n\\nWe were told by the very nice young lady at the bar that this restaurant makes their own Sangria in two different flavors - Tamarind & Passion Fruit.  We were given sample cups to try and although the decision was difficult, I chose Tamarind.  The menu offers glasses or pitchers of Sangria.  It was hard to converse with the employees at the bar due to a language barrier. I tried to convey that we wanted a pitcher of Sangria, to which the male bartender showed us a pitcher used for beer and said that it wasn't meant for Sangrias.  Joe and I looked at each other and finally said OK just give us glasses then!  We ended up with souvenir glasses that cost us a whopping $16.00 each!  \\n\\nIt seemed like we had to wait a long time to get a table, and I was getting very hungry.  I told Joe, I'm OK with eating at the bar, but he was insistent on eating in the dining room.  As we finished our watered down Sangria's, we decided that we would just leave and go somewhere else.  That's when they told us that a table was finally ready!  When we entered the dining room, I noticed that it is made to look like you are on a old village street with colorfully painted building facades.  Large Christmas lights and other eclectic decorations hung down from the high ceilings.\\n\\nThe menu offers a lot of different selections of seafood, chicken and beef.  Joe had been talking about wanting to try the giant pork chop (Chuleta Kan Kan).  I, however had a hard time figuring out what I wanted.  Most of the items seemed basic, vague and lacked description as to what the dish contained or how it was cooked.  Talking with the waitress was once again useless because of the language barrier, so I played it safe and ended up with a simple bowl of shrimp soup.  \\n\\nWhen our food arrived, I actually enjoyed the soup which contained 9 shrimps (yes I counted), Spanish rice, chopped peppers, tomatoes and onions.  But Joe's pork chop turned out to be dry, over salted, with excessive gristle and fat.  To make things worse, when Joe asked for another glass of water, it tasted strangely metallic, unlike what he got at the bar!  Because our drinks were so pricey and you don't get any free refills with your souvenir glass, I ended up savoring what melted ice I had left in my glass!   \\n\\nEven though my dinner was decent, everything else we experienced was a big disappointment!   I'm sorry to say, I couldn't wait to get back to our condo and put our evening behind us!"},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is our favorite restaurant in the North End.

Entrance.  WTF.  Where is the main entrance?  Salty Pig's front entrance is the size of a closet door.

Again WTF.\\n\\nStage Two Seating and Pre-meal.  Unlike my friend I sat in a high chair made apparently of marshmallows as it was ridiculously light (if you've been I'm sure you've noticed too...and if you've yet to go take notice).  We were greeted by a friendly and very knowledgeable waitress who helped us navigate the unfamiliar menu.  She was top notch. In fact I wish I could use her as a personal waitress at every restaurant.  \\n\\nAfter sitting my friend and I commented on the oddity of having no beer bottles only draft and beer in a can.  Next, we were left to ponder the menu only to find out later that more than 3 items were unavailable.  At only 6:30 on an uncrowded Saturday.  WTF again.  We are talking deli meats here people not 18 hour slow smoked brisket.\\n\\nStage three dinner...aka appetizers.  Both my friend and I ordered separate meat and cheese platters.  The meats and cheeses were exceptionally good.  The cheese was noticeably allowed to sweat which exposed a wonderful flavor.  The crustini however was the same bread brought to the table with our drinks.  Except unlike the prior bread this bread was a charred black granite-like rock.  A little overdone....\\n\\nStage Four.  If you go to a restaurant for the waitstaff you'll be quiet content at Salty Pig.  Likewise if your looking for after work drink scene with snacks and drinks Salty Pig might be the ticket.

Our waitress came over within seconds of us being seated, immediately took our order and brought drinks over promptly, even though they were pretty busy. Food was out and on our table in under 10 minutes, and everyone loved it (we all tried bites of each others- no complaints here). I've got to admit, we were a little...scared...when we saw a band coming in to set up. You know the drill. You're trying to have dinner, a band starts playing and your conversations turn to \\"WHAT?!\\"'s ...\\"HUH?!\\"'s...and \\"I'M SORRY- CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?!\\" because the volume is so loud. So when we saw the band start setting a speaker up we told each other we'd quickly finish up and leave......then they started playing. Um...WOW. Crazy good, and thumbs up to the two musicians (sorry I didnt' catch a name) but thanks for not only adding a great soundtrack, but actually understanding the appropriate volume for a music played at an eatery. Others take note. We ended up sticking around longer for the music and atmosphere.\\n\\n- A +++ Service. Seriously guys, how did you get such a killer waitstaff / host all around?

I only had about 1.5 hours before the next leg of my journey, so I was looking for something nearby.  A family member who lives in Boston and works in the restaurant industry suggested Row 34, so I took a cab from the train station (five bucks and about a five minute ride). \\n\\nI had a huge suitcase with me, which felt a bit embarrassing, but this was obviously a common occurrence, as the hostesses gave me a ticket and whisked away my suitcase to a coat check area with a smile.  \\n\\nIt was around 6:15 pm on a Sunday evening and the place was PACKED.  There were no seats at the bar or in the restaurant, but there were handy ledges where one could stand with a drink and an appetizer.\\n\\nThere is a wait list for the bar AND the restaurant, which I did not understand at first.  But, rather than leaving me alone to fend for myself, the bartender made sure that I knew this,  helped me out and found me a seat at the bar to enjoy my dinner after a relatively short wait.\\n\\nI was sorry that I did not have more time to spare, as the menu - especially the raw bar menu - looked phenomenal.  I ended up getting the deviled crab toast with smoked paprika and the asparagus salad with creme fraiche and pecorino.  Both were delicious.

For the price, the actual eatable pizza is extremely small (about $25-30). After shelling out that kind of cash on this kind of pizza, you would hope they have table service right? They don't.\\n\\nI can't really recommend Antico's when there are better authentic Italian pizzas in Atlanta for cheaper. But, the hype is so high around this place, I feel obligated to tell you to go once. You'll know after having your first bite of your pizza if this place is for you or not."},{"name":"Zend Conscious Lounge","address":"1130 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Made a reservation and arrived to learn that this restaurant has closed.

My husband had a quarter chicken and he loved it enough to say it was the best rotisserie chicken he had ever had. I had the yucca with garlic and an empanada, both were wonderful.

If I could give it a 2.75 that's probably what I would do, as it is slightly below \\"A-OK.\\"  \\n\\nThat said, the upside was we didn't reserve and got a table within about 15 minutes at 7p on Sunday evening.  There was a coffee shop next door with tables outside, so we took up some space outside as the weather was cool and no one was sitting at any of the tables.  \\n\\nOnce inside, they seated us next to a 2-some by the wall, and shortly afterwards came and moved us across the aisle to another table-- I can only assume to make it easier on the waitstaff to access the table near the wall.  \\n\\nStaff was friendly, and timing was good on everything except follow up at the end of the meal- we had asked for some food to be packaged, and it arrived and we sat for another 10 minutes at least while waiter walked past numerous times. Finally asked if we wanted some dessert at which point we declined and asked for the check.  They DO take credit cards, BTW.\\n\\nWe ordered the ribbollita soup and the misto verde followed by the fusilli al tegamino and a white pizza with spinach and mozzarella.  The salad was superb: generous portion, nice mix of greens and few sliced grape tomatoes with a divine balsamic vinaigrette. I could have licked the bowl when I was done!\\n\\nRibbollita soup was a disappointment; not bad, but just bland and not terribly flavorful-- the veggies all tasted the same and it felt thin.  I was afraid that the soup would be too filling and be left unfinished so we didn't overdo before the main course.  We did leave it unfinished, because it wasn't worth it. \\n\\nPIzza was about the same. I had only one bite, but wasn't thrilled. It tasted no better than pizza I had in Virginia at a brick oven place in a mall; not what I had expected from the North End.  BF has a less adventuresome palate but even he was non-plussed, saying it was again, bland.  He only ate 1/2 of it. \\n\\nFusilli was very good- and very hot!  Nice creamy goat cheese mixed perfectly with the piquant tomato sauce and the eggplant, zucchini, and peppers were plentiful.  If I had eaten only the salad and fusilli, this would have been an easy 3.5, but it was brought down by the mediocrity of the soup and pizza.  \\n\\nAlso, just a bit too noisy for someone with middle-aged ears.

It has so much character and is so unique. The walls are adorned with many different paintings and great photos of musicians. There is a bar/restaurant, soaking pool and music venue in this building along with the hotel. It's crazy how it all fits but it does! I had the \\"Sleeping Lessons\\" room which was conveniently located right next to the bathrooms. The room is very small but there was just two of us so it was fine. The rooms have a sink and mirror and have both towels and toiletries. We had a cool view of downtown and the bathrooms were seemingly maintained pretty regularly. I was worried about the shower situation and that the bathrooms would be constantly occupied but they weren't! They were almost always vacant and really clean. The only downside about this hotel is the noise, the walls in the rooms are really thin so you hear just about everything. With the bar below you easily can hear drunk people stumbling out and being loud. You hear every street noise there is but that isn't the worst part. The worst thing is the routine trash deliveries at 6am, 9 am and we even heard it at 3 am. The seafood restaurant across the street gets deliveries everyday which you will hear. So The only downside about being right next to the bathroom... When you are right next to the bathroom on a Friday night and there are drunk people in your hotel, you get to hear people vomiting for an hour and a half. Other than that fun and so cute!

Although we went the week after Memorial Day weekend it was still really busy, the waiters said that it was actually not that busy when we were there. \\n\\nThis place is located in the middle of nowhere, but I guess that is the allure and novelty of it. It is located on a farm and the parking lot for the most part is not paved, you can't miss this place there are green fields all around with a huge parking lot of more that 500 cars, the entrance has changed so in case you haven't been here in a while keep an eye out for it, the signs posted outside do a good job of pointing you in the right direction. \\n\\nOnce you park your car and get there, there is usually a wait, they told us 45 minutes but in reality it only took 20 minutes. While you wait you can buy popcorn for a dollar or lemonade for 2 dollars (this is best freshly squeezed lemonade I have ever had). Waiting is an experience in itself, the atmosphere outside is made as if it is a huge barbeque at someone's home, just with 1000 people. Think of it like a big party.\\n\\nOn the way to your table, you will pass by a big pit, there are 2 of them on the premises, I have never seen that much meat in one place at one time. The food is phenomenal, they really mean Texas portions in this place so be wary of ordering too much food."},{"name":"Surly Girl Saloon","address":"1126 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Wow! That's all I can say about this place. Crazy cool atmosphere. Great service! Cool and expansive selections of food and beer!

This place is well thought out!"},{"name":"Kika Tapas","address":"5 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Tapas are expensive. We all know this. And it's ok, when tapas are delicious. \\n\\nBetween the two of us, we tried 8 different tapas. None were impressive, or even great. The patatas bravas weren't cooked all the way through. The eggplant dish was served stone cold, which I assume was purposeful, but not delicious. \\n\\nThe cheese bread and the chicken in tomato sauce were the best things we had by far.\\n\\nThe waiter was kind of standoffish, took forever to bring us the check, and made us feel dumb for our very sincere and not-overly-terrible pronunciations of the menu. Hey man, I'm tryin' here. He also forgot the beef empanada we ordered until we asked for it, and brought it out at the same time as the churros. We actually had ordered the cauliflower broccoli patties and didn't realize that they never brought them out until we got home and realized that not only did they not bring out one of the dishes we ordered, they charged us for it too. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is pretty nice, but I can think of a lot of better tapas places in Boston, and even though this one is the most convenient to my location, I wouldn't come here again."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The restaurant is in a great location and has a hip, lively ambiance. The cocktails are great. The food menu is always changing (aside from a few staple items) and can be very hit or miss. My favorite is the chicken and churros for brunch with the mimosa bar. Most items are in the $8-12 range, though they are tapas so the portion size is quite small (generally need 2-3 items/ person to make a meal)."},{"name":"Tube","address":"18 NW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Their vegan BLT scares me.  Not so much tremble-scary but kinda the way Tremors 2 was scary.  Which was on all 3 screens when I was there, btw, so yeah I know what I'm talking about.  The fakin was creepy accurate and I ate with sly withdrawal-weary composure.  Damn that was good.  And something cheap.  It's all kinda fuzzy but I'll guesstimate at $6-7\\n\\nTwo people, four well drinks, eight bucks.

For any occasion we make a point to eat here. The steak just melts in your mouth. We've even made a habit of checking out Ruth Chris in different states, even hawaii on our honeymoon and they hold up their image. We are so bummed that the Providence one closed down. The Boston staff can be a little unfriendly and we were so please with the service in providence. Our server was named Stephanie and made the whole experience even better! Boston could use some of her personality"},{"name":"B Cafe","address":"405 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Damn it. Always disappointing! I have been an upwards of 10 times in the last year. My gf goes to yo cha and I'll grab fried ice cream at B. Every single time, they do not have the flavor I want, but I deal with it because it's across the street. Today, I ordered green tea which they confirmed they had (woah!!!). After waiting five minutes, I was told they were out of green tea, and they asked me what flavor I wanted. I said vanilla. Once I got into it I found out it was coconut which is gross af. Major disappointment, B Cafe! Get your shit together. I think I'm finally done giving you chances."},{"name":"Acitron Cocina Mexicana","address":"473 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"4","text":"We went for lunch on a recent Monday and enjoyed the meal. The restaurant was almost empty when we arrived at noon. Service was attentive and gracious. I ordered beef Enchiladas Acitr√≥n, a tasty dish with a piquant sauce roja, but the dish was not hot enough (temperature-wise) for my liking. My better half had a chile relleno made with a fresh charred poblano chile pepper that was proclaimed to be \\"delightful.\\" The batter was fried puffy as a browned marshmallow and the cheese was perfectly melted--not an easy thing. The dishes were accompanied by bland well-cooked rice but the beans, now they were exceptional; salty, cumin-infused with just the right amount of smokey. My only regret is there wasn't a whole plate of these beauties. We shared tamal de chocolat for dessert. It's a decent version of one of my favorite desserts; a bittersweet chocolate and coarse ground masa tamal in a dribble of cinnamon sauce with a scoop of eggy vanilla ice cream--oh yeah! Coffee was fresh brewed, medium bodied, and served with steamed milk on the side. We'll return, no question."},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"818 S Orlando Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"2.5","text":"Steak 'N Shake is Open 24 hours and the best milkshakes, however, no matter which location I visit, the tables are sticky and service is slow and lacking. They are also not accommodating with special orders, such replacing a burger patty with a chicken patty even when I offer to pay an \\"up charge.\\"  Furthermore, the servers don't seem happy.ever.

I had always heard great things about their BBQ, whether it's on Man v Food or the manliest places to eat in America, etc. the buzz was relentless.  So I went in with high expectations and wow it did not disappoint.  \\n\\nThe turkey, ribs, sausage, brisket, etc. were amazing.  The ambiance of the restaurant was also very chill with its BYOB and outdoor seating.  Its a bit of a drive from Austin cause its out in Hill Country, but its well worth it if you live in the Austin area.  To top it off, on my way flying back I grabbed a sausage sandwich at their outlet in the Austin Bergstrom Airport prior to leaving to savor it one more time."},{"name":"Worlds Magic Restaurant","address":"7044 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Don't let the strange name dissuade you from eating here. \\n\\nTo be honest, we almost didn't go because of that.\\n\\nWe ordered the Data, which was average, but we would have loved if they had it lamb (they only had beef and chicken)\\n\\nWhat was amazing was the combo, a nice selection of Indonesian dishes, served with basmati rice.\\n\\nDefinitely recommended."},{"name":"Nubian Queen Lola's Cajun Soul Food","address":"1815 Rosewood Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We went on a Friday evening before close. They were all out of gumbo, but I ordered jambalaya. It was so good, I finished it in minutes! I got a large and it was plenty to eat, along with two sides.

Having to choose between cafeteria food, more cafeteria food, or The Loop? Um, duh.\\n\\nNow that I'm a little older - and hopefully a little wiser - I see the error of my ways. Somewhat. While I've grown up and realized that the pizza here is nothing to shake a stick at (well, maybe shake a stick at it to make it go away, shoo shoo!), I still really enjoy the fried chicken salad. Then again, I was born and raised in the south, so fried chicken is necessary to keep me alive... You can also get sandwiches and soup here, and I should mention that the tomato bisque is certainly tasty. Oh wait, I know why I always come back here. Their ranch dressing. I don't even eat ranch anymore, but if someone says \\"Want to go to the Loop?\\" I order it by the gallon. Thankfully, this location doesn't charge you 50 cents a pack for the ranch (thank you, college goldmine!).\\n\\nThe prices here are decent for what it's worth. They aren't the best prices for what you get in regards to some items, but that ranch makes something worth my while to show my face here every once in the while.

Recently moved into B Hill and just walked to it thinking it was like a casual pub. We were suprised to see it was a bit more upscale. \\n\\nIt was but not at all stuffy. The prices can get high if you are just stopping in for a quick after work meal or lunch but it really is good. \\n\\nI am over the moon for the chicken sandwich. The fries are the best I have ever had but if the waitress asks if you want your fries parmesan, just know there is a charge. Still, yum yum.\\n\\nThe wine list and bar are great although I usually dont partake. Desserts I could take or leave but you will be too stuffed to eat them anyway.\\n\\nGO GO GO to Harvard Gardens!

Very cute, small Italian dining found on Burnside. Lighting was dim and it was difficult to read the menu...even the waitress had trouble reading the total amount on our check and almost overcharged. I'd say the ambiance is what gave this restaurant the most stars. Food is overpriced and the service was meh.\\nOur party of 4 was not greeted with the most excitement and we were told we could wait if we wished to for about 15 minutes, although there was clearly enough spots available for our small party. We opted to wait and did for not even 10 minutes. Our waitress greeted us at some point and took our order, not specifying that there were two options for the pasta bowl size, half and full. The full bowl order was placed before informing our group of the price difference and the option to have a half order. When we were finally able to get the attention of our waitress to inquire about the half bowl, she informed our group that the plates were already up (full order) and there was nothing they could do. She then returned to inform us that the half plates were more for sharing. Helpful, but this information would have served us better prior to ordering. We received our plates which appeared to be half size and although tasty, not $20 tasty. Nothing too exciting about the meals, regular pasta bowls that could easily be replicated. I was still hungry after finishing. In addition, after the awkward exchange between our waitress, another waitress took over midway to complete our transaction. Just felt a little weird and awkward. \\n\\nOVERALL\\n\\nVery cute place, food OK, service meh"},{"name":"The Brewer's Table","address":"4715 E 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It is rare that a restaurant/brewery can be completely original. The Brewer's Table has managed to achieve that. \\n\\nThe Chef's/Brewer's philosophy resounds through their menu - fresh ingredients, beer as food, and food as beer. Dishes like the \\"Preserved Artichoke Dip\\" and the \\"Hearth Bread\\" could have easily been the typical, creamy, buttery, cheesy blah as many restaurants serve, but instead they decided to take these dishes to a beautiful new level. The \\"artichoke dip\\" was fresh and clean with perfectly crispy chips (made out of beer-brewing remnants nonetheless). The Hearth Bread was served with a brown butter that went perfectly with a smear of roasted garlic - a combination I have NEVER had in a restaurant before. The Venison Tartare was prepared so that it was easy to spread and bite on these fantastic pita bread pieces with a sprinkle of yeast and rendered fat. Only complaint here was that the pita outlived the tartare. Moving to mains - the Rabbit Carnitas could have been good with the home-made tortillas, seasoned and satisfyingly chewy rabbit, and a traditional mole... but what pushed them over the edge into great was the option for three different types of perfectly round vegetable \\"tortillas\\" to give you a crunchy protein-style variation on the dish.  Then there was dessert.\\n\\nWe opted for two desserts, and were overwhelmingly satisfied with both of them. First was the bite-sized ice cream cone, made with the four ingredients (five if you include love) that beer is made from. For me, this was the perfect end to a big meal with a sweet and satisfying cold, crunchy bite. For my dining partner* (see note below) - she had to end the meal with chocolate, so the \\"Malt Balls\\" really appealed to her. Rightfully so - they were surrounded by a creamy bannana foam and crunchy bits of nuts and coffee. Each malt ball was like a dense truffle that anchored the dish. \\n\\nLet's see.... am i forgetting anything? OH. THE BEER. DUH. \\n\\nUnfortunately they aren't beer Jesus (turn water into beer overnight) so they are still brewing their first official batches. However, the beer and wine list was impressive to say the least. It is nice that they worked so hard to feature the best that Austin (and elsewhere) have to offer for beer. It is clear that they are well-connected in the community, especially when you drop down to the bottom of their beer list and see something you literally have never seen before... a Jester King sour made and served specifically for The Brewer's Table. If you have made it this far in my treatise, you have stumbled upon the holy grail. Order it. They have it until it's gone, and it will never be again. Like dust in the wind. Poof.\\n\\n*Amazing, funny, hot girlfriend\\n\\n(EDIT NOTES:  The original review has been corrected for an omission, the \\"dining partner\\" has read my review and questioned my reasoning behind not including the fact that she is my girlfriend. Omission corrected.)"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"There I was tickets to see a Celtics game with my Father and Grandfather.
