That means I feel equally at home whether I'm here with a date, want to sit alone with a book, meet a large group, or just stop by for coffee with a few friends. It's big enough and busy enough at any given time that I blend in when I want to be alone and won't be overheard if I want to have an intimate conversation. Bonus: Late hours! There are multiple outlets throughout the space, which makes it a great place to take your laptop. However, I rarely do this, as I don't want to pay for wi-fi. \\n\\nIt's got a reputation as a queer hangout, which is only half true: Diesel's clientele runs the gamut, but it's definitely an extremely queer friendly space, which is awesome.\\n\\nThe food and coffee are always consistently great. I don't know why anyone complains about the prices: They are pretty comparable to Starbucks, and I would rather give my money to a local business that supports other local businesses instead of serving processed crap. Their sandwiches and salads are the highlights of the menu. My favorite is the Little Piston, which is basically a caprese sandwich on 1/3 of a baguette. Ask for it toasted and you've got a brilliant hangover cure.\\n\\nDiesel could up their game when it comes to baked goods and tea. The baked goods are yummy, but it would be great to see some new additions to the selection. As for the tea, I would love to see something on offer that is not from MEM Tea Imports.

However the new server was also in the weeds and told me he couldn't help me and said he'd talk to my server. Great. So I finally get the sauce....which doesn't help at all.

And the Lobster Stop in Quincy shines bright among a sea* of competitors in the area   Both a sea food restaurant and market, the prices here are always very reasonable, and are comparable to the price that you would pay in your local grocery store, with lobsters starting around $4.99/lb for chicken lobsters, and between $6.99 to $8.99 for larger lobsters, depending on size.  But if you're not in the mood to cook yourself, the Lobster Stop has a great menu, consisting mostly of fried sea food; so if you're in a healthy eating mood, this isn't going to be the place to get your salad fix.  They also serve steamed lobsters and clams which are served to order in house only--this isn't an item you can order and take home with you; but why would you do that anyway?  By the time you get home, the meat inside the shell will overcook while steaming in its shell and ruin it. So, if you want steamed lobster eat it IN house or at YOUR house to avoid chewing on rubber and throwing your money down the toilet. Who likes elastic lobster?  NOBODY! \\nThough the food on the menu at the Lobster Stop is top shelf and super fresh, the lobster roll steals the thunder from all the other items on their menu.  Born and raised in these parts, and I can tell you that I have sampled many a lobster roll in my day, and the Lobster Stop's roll is the best I have ever had. It is loaded with lobster meat that is lightly mixed with mayo and small bits of celery for texture. They let their lobsters speak for themselves, and don't over saturate them with mayo and kill the natural sea flavors.  So if you're feeling guilty about the lack of veggies eating here, feel better that the additional calories weren't loaded on with globs of caloric, belly-busting mayo.\\nThis is has become one of my favorite spots, as become evident by my frequent visits (I'm averaging 2-3 times a month--yes, it is THAT good).  The freshness of the food has to be accredited to the Lobster Stop's owner, Peter Dawson, who has been a lobsterman for over 30 years.  As one who catches and consumes the lobsters, I can't think of a better a person to open up a place that serves them.  I hope that the Lobster Stop stays around for years to come, as this is the kind of place worth shucking out money for!  I always know that I am going to get a great product when I come here, and have yet to be disappointed. \\nThe Lobster Stop is located at the foot of the Fore River Bridge in Quincy Point, on the border of North Weymouth, on Rt. 3A.  It is nestled in between the bridge, the USS Salem and the MBTA Commuter Boat.  Parking has never really been an issue for me, but I can't speak to days where they have lines out the door.

The chicken was really tough and dry and tasted as if they grabbed it off of someone else's plate a few days ago and reheated it in the microwave before they served it to me. The refried beans were ok (but really, how can you mess those up?), but the rice tasted like they just pulled out a box of instant rice and simmered over med-high heat then mixed in a can of veggies.  \\n\\nI don't like complaining or sending food back as I'm always nervous they'll tamper with it before serving it to me again, so I decided to just grin and bear it. However, at the end of my meal the manager came to our table and asked how our lunch was. Then he immediately turned his attention to me and asks \\"and the mole?\\" I tell him \\"eh, it was ok... but the chicken tasted a little old.\\" The manager proceeds to say, \\"Yes, we know.

Oddly, there's only 1-2 restaurants in Austin that have this high of a rating.  The Driskill's restaurant which i went to the next night is one of the others.  It's odd that so few people go there (maybe not so odd because Barton Creek is a little out of the way) but given that so few people make it there, it's not surprising that this is the first review. \\n\\nI'll give this place 5 stars.  The venison was awesome.  The soup of the day (I want to say artichoke bisque?) was very well done and presented at the table artistically.  The wine recommendation was a spectacular Lode red.  The server didn't just recommend the most expensive thing on the menu, he actually did take our preferences into account and recommended a nice wine in the middle of the menu's price range.  The wine list was shockingly affordable which could be just because I'm used to San Francisco wine prices and possibly also because I dined at the Driskill the following night which had numerous wines over $2000 per bottle. \\n\\nAnd wow, the service was beyond belief?  Why?  Because we were the only ones in the place!  The place is that good but it's always empty.  And we were there on a Thursday night.  This restaurant, although one of the finest (by rating, by rep, etc...) in Austin, is 20 minutes from the center of the city and therefore, for the most part, only gets guests of the hotel.

The fact that it's so good and the service is so excellent and yet there's such privacy and a feeling of seclusion - like you're in the middle of nowhere - it's quite a treat.

When in New England, you absolutely have to order New England chowder and I'm pretty sure I had at least one cup of chowder everyday I spent on the East Coast.  And while the heavy, creamy, hearty chowder here may not be the most appropriate summer eating, one of their crisp, fresh and flavorful salads will perfectly balance the weight of chowder and will cool you off on a hot, summer eve.  The steaks are always cooked to perfection and the lobster is some of the meatiest and succulent.  As a West Coast boy I unfortunately have little experience eating such delicious, fresh lobster but loved each and every bite of this red-shelled yumminess.  \\n\\nUnfortunately I never sat inside (too busy soaking up sun rays and summer warmth) but the setting is very chic, clean lined and modern, yet still inviting and comfortable.

No one seems to be up to the challenge.\\n\\nHarsh review?  Possibly but here are three tips I leave for Winflo:\\n- All good Italian restaurants have olive oil on the table.\\n- If you boast an all Italian wine list, make sure your staff knows the difference between a Valpolicella and Nero D'Avola.\\n- Don't serve Lasagna.  Even if you think it is good, no self respecting restaurant has gotten away with it.  Lasagna is the dish restaurants serve on Sunday's to use up all their ingredients from the week.  At the very least take it off the menu and serve it as a special from time to time.

I get to the pick up window and the lady hands me one drink and says here is your coke, then hands me a bag of food stuffed to the very top and says here is your food, then with the kind of urgency a long busy night was sure to produce she hands me the last drink and hurries me along with a stressed look (no worries I get it, long night!).

Yeah, it showed up after our appetizers.  We didn't ask about it, because we didn't know it existed.

I said, \\"Well, that's great, but we ordered it an hour and a half ago.\\"  She just walked away.\\n\\nLook, I get that the veal takes longer. But the time to mention that is not when people have been sitting in your restaurant for 2 hours.  You mention that when someone orders the dish.  At the very least, you mention it when you clear the appetizers.  And also, if it takes 40 minutes, that means you started cooking it AFTER we had our appetizers.  And she was so snotty and condescending, it turned me off completely.  If I wanted to be patronized, I'd call my mother, thanks.  \\n\\nIt's a shame, really, because the food itself was decent.

One in our party got the steak and the sauce was second to none. Duck fat potato cake was crispy and tender. Hot Milk Cake with salted caramel topping for dessert was the star of the show. So much so that we googled the recipe (and found Chef Zeb's version easily) from the parking lot! SERVICE was marginal and disappointing. Bare minimum to be considered hospitable. What a shame as the food deserved someone to be passionate and engaged.

Of course, months go by, & we're sucked in again (because their Ruby Ale is one of a kind & that damned good). My point is, however, to p!$$ off regulars on a semi-regular basis is bad business. Our tab came to $52 for 2 burgers, 1 kids corn dog meal, a soda & a pitcher of beer. $52?! The wait staff always asks how we want our burgers cooked. We always say medium, we always get well done. It's become a joke now. Why on earth even ask the question if the cook is unable to do anything but cook a burger well done? But their new thing is that they've removed the signs near the doors that explain whether to check in with a hostess or seat yourself. So upon arriving, standing there for a few minutes & seeing both a bartender & a waitress look at us without acknowledging us, we sat at an empty table. And we're ignored endlessly until my husband got up to find the same waitress who made eye contact with us upon arrival. She explained that they have a hostess & since we seated ourselves she didn't know we were there. Where was said hostess??? She also explained that they removed the signs at the door because it's supposed to force the staff to engage the customers more, but that it's just caused confusion. Well yes, it would, because (on this particular night anyways) there's no hostess & no acknowledgement by the staff that we were standing there awkwardly wondering if we should seat ourselves.  I like the vibe any mcmenamins has, & I love their beer. But I'm becoming increasingly annoyed by their inflated prices & so-so food. The whole \\"we have an invisible hostess\\" thing was just the topping on the cake.

We've tried it 3-4 times since the change, and always had the same negative experience.\\n\\nThe food is still good, but very over priced.  If you go during a happy hour, sit at the bar and get drinks it's OK.  If you want a family meal forget it.  It takes FOREVER to be seated, order, get drinks, get your food, and get your check at the end.  This has happened consistently the past few years.  I like to give a place the benefit of the doubt after having a poor experience.  But we've had nothing but poor experiences and have finally decided we will not be returning.  We even tried getting it 'to go' once, thinking we would avoid the long wait times.  We arrived when they told us our food would be ready, and they hadn't even started cooking our pizza yet.

However, were only disappointed by the pastas: we ordered 3 separate dishes. We both enjoyed the braised beef - it was hardy but delicious. There was a random Tuna pesto dish, which was quite salty and I did not quite understand that combination. Then finally a lamb pasta, which was also quite salty. The combination of a hot inside temp, lots of salt, and a grill cooking 15' away from us adding more heat to the party was just disappointing and required multiple trips to the restroom due to rabid water consumption. \\nThey do so much well at Renata and the heat thing was very likely a freak incident. My only suggestion is that I wish they could add their takes on some other pasta dishes along the mainstream spectrum. I think that Tuna/pesto can safely go into a cage indefinitely.

The Asian in me just gets so damn excited when I pick up a dozen (or two) of these deliciously awesome pockets of potato spiced up love.\\n\\nNote: I hate samosas which are all thick skin and very minimal filling. Samosas here have a very thin outer skin, and a bounty of potato mixed filling.  The potatoes have a wonderful waxy texture that is perfect for samosas.  The right amount and mix of spices feels like a refreshing punch to your face when you have that first bite. Yes, you are indeed in flavourtown and all of your taste buds are invited.\\n\\nBut wait, you gotta have the sauce.  A sweet, but not too sweet tamarind sauce adds yet another punch of flavour on your lips.  \\n\\nThe kicker: they are 3 for $1.  Yes that is correct. 3 for $1.  \\n\\nThey've always been fresh every time I've come in and ordered them. Have them fresh and they are amazing.

The girl didn't really know how to use it, and tried to charge only 25 cents instead of $25 to the card.  She kept confusing herself more and more that she finally called her manager over. He couldn't figure it out either, so finally they just told us to sit down and they would work it out.

He gave us a giant plate of chips and salsa to make up for it.\\n\\nA few minutes later again a waitress came by with a HUGE peanut butter cookie from the manager.

And I have to say, this place garners a solid 4.5 stars, but since there is no halfsies, I have to bump them up to 5 stars! Which was mostly due to my pleasant dining company, but I digress. \\n\\nMeeting up for dinner after work on a random Monday is always a great idea, especially when sangria is involved! I drove up to the restaurant, but alas - no valet in sight. And so, I did the loop-de-loop for about... 20 minutes. Good thing I was 20 minutes early! I found parking, and my trusty Tomtom assured me that I was only 2 minutes away. Until I realized, oh he meant 2 CAR minutes away. But it was a surprisingly balmy night, and so I buckled in for the .5 mile hike (good thing I was wearing my comfy boots vs. my conquer the world heels)! \\n\\nI give them serious brownie points for decor. Candles on every table, dimmed lighting, coppery ceiling, warm golden tones everywhere. I felt comfortable. I felt like I was going to dinner at a friend's place. The hostess was gracious in letting us know that we would have a 30 minute wait, and so we found a corner of the bar to call our own as we drank through a pitcher of delicious sangria. And yeah, a 30 minute wait at 6PM on a Monday night. They were unexpectedly busy! \\n\\nWe were finally ushered into a cute booth, about two steps away from where we were standing at the bar, and we tucked in for a great meal. Mmm... first dish, those delectable meatballs in a green pepper sauce and crisp potato sticks. I didn't like the way the meatballs fell apart the minute my fork pierced their meaty goodness, but they were delicious. And I absolutely HEART potato sticks. \\n\\nThe duck confit came next, resting on a bed of what looked like red cabbage with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Do I detect a hint of apple as well? Whatever it was, it was delicious. And that duck was falling off the bone good. And it was a sweet portion! If I wasn't on a date, I would've picked that thing up and gnawed on the bone. Delish! \\n\\nAnd then, my favorite dish of the evening... ham and cheese croquettes with a spicy pepper relish. DIVINE. The warm cheese gave in with a crisp bite of the breadcrumb exterior, and that pepper relish gave it just the right kick in the pants. LOVED IT. \\n\\nI expected to moan in pleasure over the goat cheese fritters after reading so much about how other Yelpers enjoyed them, but they kind of fell flat for me. Maybe they were cold? Or maybe they just couldn't stand up to the show that the ham and cheese croquettes did? Only my next visit will tell. \\n\\nWe finished our meal by sharing an order of their bread pudding. Thick slices of bread swimming in a pool of vanilla custardy goodness. Mmmmmmmmm. With JUST the right amount of raisins to make it one of the better bread puddings I've had in a long time. \\n\\nJust their coffee warrants 5 stars. I loved the coffee they served me. And I'm a coffee expert (it's part of the job, what can I say), and it was... perfection. \\n\\nAnd the best part is - we received impeccable service (just the right amount where we sat there and chatted each other up without being interrupted, and we didn't feel neglected). And I really liked the way the hostess apologized for interrupting us when she was letting us know that our table was ready.... and I never felt rushed, even though a good sized crowd had gathered near the entrance by the time we left. \\n\\nBravo."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Hey, so a few points need to be made right at the beginning here... first, while I AM an adventurous eater, I haven't grown up eating much asian food beyond bland sushi and westernized chinese.  In the past few years I've had the opportunity to travel in china a bit and started getting a lot more adventurous in trying new things outside my own cultural touchstones.  My wife is much more conservative about food than I am and when I suggested a visit to Yuzu after reading about it in the Oregonian she hemmed and hawed a bit - but the sound of the tasty ramen won her over.  Wow!  We had a great time.  Made a reservation and met some friends and embarked on a delicious trip to Japan.  We all had pork ramen and we all loved it.  Gyoza and a chicken dish were enjoyed by all.  I had some beef tongue (my first time) and was very impressed at its rich taste.  It was cooked just right too, not too chewy, but not tough either.  Grilled mackerel was juicy and flavorful and terrific.  This place is just blocks from my house and I am really excited about finding it.  \\nIt is pretty small, but isn't totally tiny.

Lately I've been interrupted at Starbucks where I usually work during the day by so many angry conversations at adjacent tables that I keep being afraid I'm going to explode. Every one of us is capable of being just as closed off and angry and afraid of the other side as any of the rest of us. That's like, where the self-perpetuating cycle of division makes it easiest to go. I have just really hated feeling angry at neighbors I don't know for their bumper stickers.

I do try to come by here every now and then though to support the business and spread the love or when Santouka and Kintaro are too full which is most of the time. I find that the quality of their soup stock is not as superior as the other places, I am guessing this might be because they don't let it simmer as long as other places.  The pork used also does not seem to be as tender and juicy as you might find in the other ramen restaurants, this could either be because of the way the meat is cooked or the quality or grade of the meat used altogether. The noodles are probably the one area where this spot can compete with it's more popular ramen neighbors. \\n\\n(Only proceed to read if you want the customer service review portion behind the review)\\n\\nIf there is one thing you can look forward to in dining at a Japanese establishment, no matter how casual it may be is the enthusiasm that you feel at your patronage.  Even if most of the Japanese restaurants around are not Japanese owned or run, this is a staple of the Japanese dining experience.  My wife and I who were out walking with our son decided to drop by Motomachi because it was close to dinner time and it was quite empty at the time.  Since we had my son's stroller which is somewhat bulky, I surveyed the area inside and after determining that it would not fit comfortably I offered to park it at the back alley behind their establishment after which I got a snappy response from the waitress saying that they cannot guarantee it's safety and they will not be held liable for it.   Perfectly understandable and I agreed and said that they wouldn't have to worry as I am assuming the risk of parking it right outside their back door even if I had no locks or chains for it. Her male colleague who was more junior than her agreed that the back would likely be the best place for the stroller and that it should be okay if I left it there. My wife and son got seated and I walked around the block with the stroller to park it where I said I would. I then proceeded to attempt to open the back door of the restaurant to rejoin my family and as I was slowly opening it, someone shut it from the inside.  I was a bit startles and decided to knock and wouldn't you know it, the same waitress came back out and said I could not pass there.( Did I look like a balrog or something?) I politely said, but didn't you folks say I could park it back here and I was hoping I could just enter through here. She gave me a firm no and shut the door on my face.  I walked around the block again and after confirming that my wife did not put in any orders, I told her I would rather eat somewhere else.  There was not attempt to stop us and the waitress just gave us a stare as if to say, \\"oh you're still here?\\".  I finally asked before leaving why she didn't let me enter through the back and she said it is reserved for employees. I asked if it was a health violation of some sort and she said no, you are just not supposed to pass through there.  At that point I left and said, that it was not nice to inconvenience customers like that.

We went in with my 22 month old son on a Wednesday evening around 530. It took about fifteen minutes to be seated, even though there were visibly at least ten tables open (should have been a sign to begin with). Our waitress took her time showing up and didn't bring our drinks for a good ten minutes. Then the fun started. We ordered an appetizer with our drinks then proceeded to wait 50 minutes to get it. During this time she refilled my water once, never offered anything else to us, and feebly apologized for the wait while pointing out a larger table that obviously was taking precedence. I really started to get upset when waitstaff consistently brought other tables their food while my son started crying because he was so hungry and didn't understand why none of it was coming to him. Our appetizer finally arrived, stone cold and soggy. It was such a mess that we told her we were just going to leave. She begged us to stay, assuring us that the entrees would be up in 3 to 4 minutes. Really? Ok then. Our son's food was cold, dry, and nasty. Our pizza was, to their only credit, hot and seemed to be good. However, we're both now sick the next day and regretting our decision to stay there even more. The manager finally did comp our bill after I was able to track her down (she had on no uniform, just a pink t-shirt that was frumpy and in no way professional). She apologized, said she had been made aware of the situation earlier - gee, thanks for coming out and rectifying it then, right? - and eventually offered to \\"buy us dinner\\" after also making an excuse about the large table (maybe ten people). Moral of the story? Only wait an hour for food there if you want to spend an hour with your head in the toilet later. Thanks for the free vomit, Old Chicago."},{"name":"MidiCi The Neapolitan Pizza Company","address":"999 Peachtree St, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I went there for the first time with my mom and our friend.

I can say that these were the best biscuits I have ever had in my life. Alongside the biscuits, we ordered the hushpuppies as another appetizer. They were very crisp and had a very flavorful dipping sauce.

The meat itself was cooked well and was incredibly juicy. But the meat lacked a lot of flavor that I was looking for in pulled pork. This is where the BBQ sauces Sweet Cheeks offers came to the rescue. The sauces added some of the smokey and spicy flavors I was looking for out of the pulled pork. The farm salad was very unique.

My only complaint with the pork belly would be that the fat is not really rendered so there are some \\"gooey\\" pieces.\\n\\nThe pickles (which I guess are made in house?) were also a perfect complement to the fatty pork belly.

The selection of pastries is never as impressive as the largely empty display cases that should be holding the aged selection. The baristas, no wait, that's too fine a term for the youngish crew behind the counters that apparently lack enough self esteem to take pride in their work or the way they present themselves, are often asking customers to repeat orders they literally just placed, and have no problem showing disdain for anyone that walks through the place and still places an order. Lastly, the coffee, which always serves to remind me that I could have just driven through McDonalds and not only done as well, but saved a couple bucks in the process.\\n\\nSo why has it been here for decades?

Once seated, we waited about 10 minutes before being visited by one of the two drink waitresses. Then another 15 minutes before we were visited by the one and only food waitress.

But I do seriously beg to differ - I was quite excited when the clintonville restaurant opened. But the thrill is gone. It only peaks my excitement now on the summer days when the patio is open and there is a good brew on tap - with exception of the cars rolling by, it's alright in my book. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes, I would absolutely love to see both the calorie content and/or sodium content in each dish. I have tried a variety of items - yes the veg burger was good, first and 2nd time around, but I'm over it. Now if I find myself there for a meal which again is rare - it's usually a cup of coffee or tea - i'll go for the Karma bowl. The portions are too big in my opinion. I am a strong supporter of locally grown produce and I love the fact you can take someone there for the first time and they instantly become addicted. \\n\\nI just don't think there is enough variety on the menu and they should really offer half-portions for some items, because it's really ridiculous. It seems counter-productive to eat somewhere \\"healthy\\" while eating 3x the healthy serving size. \\n\\nI think the restaurant brings a really nice variety to clintonville and the short north. I actually do like the atmosphere on the off hours - that place is a zoo on the weekends or dinner hour. I love the fact that it's open until 10pm. I just find it funny that I am a health nut - my mother owned a health food store growing up and this place isn't on the top of my list of places to eat. \\n\\nI think it's definitely high quality - no doubt about it, so it's nice to take someone there from out of town - you will have the same great dish that never alters every time & that's worth a whole lot. I just don't think the portions and prices are very reasonable. I am incredibly curious as to what the nutritional contents are. btw don't order the tomato soup unless you are looking for a huge toasted piece of bread laden with butter with a small serving of soup on top - what a waist, and way too salty!!

However, it's a nice hidden gem with some good food.\\n\\nI went for the Wildcat Club and the sandwich is quite large. I liked the combination of turkey, ham, and bacon with the usual veg you see in a club. The sourdough was nicely toasted. For $9.99 you can get a sandwich with a soda/water, a bag of chips and two cookies, which is a great value. \\n\\nCookies are sold by the pound. My favorites are butterscotch, peanut butter, and oatmeal raisin. If you're just gonna munch a bunch of them on your own, they sell \\"broken\\" cookies for $3.50 a bag. Most of the cookies are just ones that are stuck together or look irregular and the bags come with an assortment of flavors. So if aesthetics aren't a high priority, go for that.\\n\\nThe cupcake I had, lemon drop, was atrocious. The icing wasn't good, the cake had the consistency of sponge cake, and the lemon custard inside had this nasty layer of filmy skin.

I really really wanted to love Tasca because it's super close to my house and I LOVE tapas and spanish cuisine, and it's very reasonably priced. But it seems like you get what you pay for. \\n\\nFirst of all, there were open tables but they seated my boyfriend and I in this weird back corner table that shouldn't exist. He was blocked into his seat by another person. They seated the next two-top that walked in at a booth, so we were already a little annoyed going into it. \\n\\nThe wine list looks good, but neither of us were in a drinking mood, so we both ordered a soda - they both came flat. Our waitress, who was very sweet, said she would bring us some bread and hummus and asked if we wanted olives, we said yes. I had to ask for them later though because I think she forgot. They were tasty but they fail to provide a place to put your pits, so you end up with a bunch of olive pits on  your plate while you're trying to enjoy the other food, womp. \\n\\nWe ordered six tapas. I chose mostly classics because my boyfriend had never had tapas before. We got the boquerones, the lobster croquettes, a chorizo pastry dish (forget the name), the mussels, tortilla espanola, and albondigas. \\n\\nTo me the food was overwhelmingly bland. The croquette filling was more like a crab rangoon. No discernable lobster. The chorizo in puff pastry didn't have that spicy chorizo flavor. It was more like a sausage roll, or like something you buy in the frozen section at costco, tbh. The boquerones were tasty of course but they were served on a bed of sliced tomato and red onion, which was odd... why not serve them on tasty pa amb tomaquet or just by themselves? The veg didn't add anything to the dish for me at all. \\n\\nThe tortilla espanola was serviceable but needed more sauce for dipping in, and the mussels were actually pretty good, although a bit gritty.\\n\\n The most baffling thing to me was the albondigas. I've eaten tapas all around the states and in spain, and albondigas always come in a tomato sauce in my experience. These were described as coming in a \\"tomato cream sauce\\" which I was pretty pumped for. When they arrived I found myself hunting for the sauce - tasted like plain meatballs to me. And they were covered in some weird crispy fried chips, which weren't mentioned on the menu at all?? When I asked my waitress about it she said \\"well it's not a tomato sauce per se... it's drizzled over the top...\\" Well why describe them that way on the menu?? I understand that they're trying to put an interesting twist on traditional tapas but there's no reason for the menu to be misleading. \\n\\nAs I said, our server was very sweet, but I think she kept forgetting about us since we were in the back corner. It took about 15 mins to get a check, and we were making an effort, trying to get her attention. Meanwhile another waitress was standing at the table next to us the entire time and chatting to those customers about her dental problems... exactly what you want to listen to while you're finishing your meal! \\n\\nAll in all a very strange and underwhelming experience. I would definitely recommend Dali or Barcelona first.

The slice of lasagna was HUGE and very good. \\n\\nA couple small annoyances was around the slow service and the table/seat organization.

We came here on a Saturday for their dim sum. Despite the old-fashioned looking, cheesy Chinese looking decor, the dim sum here is actually quite good. Much exceeded my expectations. Who would have thought that you would be able to get decent dim sum in a suburb? \\n\\nThe chili oil they provided seemed to be home-made. It was spicy and good! Dip whatever you are eating in the chili oil and the food will instantly taste more flavorful (if spicy is your thing)!\\n\\nThe service is actually quite good (maybe because I speak Mandarin)? For those who don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese, I assure you that the servers and restaurant staff were not trying to bark at you. They were too eager to offer you with food but there may be a bit of a language barrier between you and them. Our empty plates were taken away promptly, and teapot refilled. I believe they served us Jasmine tea to go with the dim sum. The tea was very good and to my liking! Though they may want to invest in getting new teapots as the teapots seemed old and chipped at the spout. \\n\\nAlso, this place has its own parking lot. So no need to drive all the way to Chinatown in Boston to satisfy your dim sum craving. Come here if you live in the vicinity. :) Because this place is in a suburb rather than in Boston, the prices seemed a tad bit cheaper than your typical dim sum restaurant in Chinatown. Our bill came out to be about $20 per person (tip and tax included), but we ate like 7 or 8 dishes together! Which seemed to be a killer deal. :)\\n\\nIn addition, they seemed to be a bit understaffed, so you may have to wait for a bit before the cart full of delicious dim sum makes it to your table."},{"name":"Rose City Coffee - Sellwood","address":"7325 SE Milwaukie Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my favorite local coffee shop for a handful of reasons.

I mean it's not bad, but the servers don't really know anything, and there just aren't enough of them.  It takes several minutes to flag someone down, and then to actually get that next beer takes another ten minutes or so.\\n\\nAlso someone needs to have a stern word with whoever designs the menu here.  The burgers and fries and pizza are all reliably good, but they need to stick to what they know.  This is NOT the place to order Diver Scallops with Carmelized Cauliflower, Asparagus, and Candied Kumquats (which is on the menu).  Stick to what you do best!  Some blame can be laid on the consumer in this case, since you really shouldn't expect that to be any good.\\n\\nAlso, they have no liquor.

I've tried most of the menu, and I can absolutely agree with all of the sketchy service comments on other reviews.  I can't say I've ever had an experience with a snotty server, but preoccupied or just lazy has been a recurring theme there.  And the atmosphere is something like a sparsely decorated Mexican prison cell perhaps.  Really- ZERO atmosphere.  Even the outdoor seating is mediocre.  It's facing South Lamar and flanked by a couple of parking lots, so no real view of anything picturesque.  \\nAll of that said- I still give it 4 stars and will continue to return, knowing what I know because the food really does kick ass.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner.  Some highlights are the chicken pipian- a pumkin seed mole sauce that is just as smooth and perfectly seasoned as the same dish over at Fonda San Miguel, but so much cheaper.  The cochinita pibil- traditional interior Mexican pork dish with rice.  Never let's you down.  Heuvos Motulenos for breakfast, or perhaps the chilequiles.  Both are spot on.

Also worth noting is that the lamb wrap comes with a side, and I sampled the falafel; I don't have a very refined palette for it and thought it was a little bit dry, but for $7 and some change, I did feel like I couldn't really expect too much.

Ready?\\nThey DO NOT have unlimited Mimosas or Bloody Mary's.   I know... take a minute to process that.  \\n\\nComing from Florida, where Tap 42's unlimited brunch is acclaimed by all, and Max's Harvest is like the Willy Wonka factory of Mimosas and Bloody Mary's, this was hard to understand and accept.  My friend and I searched and searched for one Brunch place that would but instead we found an article saying how it was against the law to offer discounted price drinks (or at least that's what I understood in the confused and sad state my head was while reading it).  Still, brunch is an important weekend meal, and should not be skipped, especially on your last \\"leisure\\" day of traveling.  And, really, you still can do unlimited (if your body and wallet permits it - not necessarily in that order)  :p\\n\\nAll kidding aside (they really don't do unlimited, I wasn't kidding about that part), we asked the bartenders at our hotel bar to recommend a good Brunch place for our last Sunday in Boston.  Without even thinking they recommended Stephanie's and took out their menu for us to see.  They both said they enjoy the place and food very much and always recommend it.\\n\\nSunday came, and just (literally) around the block from where we were staying was Stephanie's.\\nJust to make sure we had a table I made reservations the night before.  The first thing I noticed were the fun/ beautiful lamps, how big the place looks from the inside, and loved the upstairs room they have, which would be perfect for a small gathering or event.  The restaurant is classy but casual, and very inviting. \\n\\nWe were immediately seated, near the kitchen, and I could see all the plates coming out making it extremely hard to decide on what to order.  One thing I did knew for sure was that we were having their Cinnamon Monkey Bread as an appetizer as soon as I saw it.  It's big, warm, not too sweet.  Can't say it's the best I've had but it was good and great for sharing!\\n\\nYes, I'm going back to the mimosas... of course I had one, and they make them just right.  Champagne to the top and a splash of OJ to make it that pretty color.  They also have a \\"Make your own Bloody Mary\\" chart where you can choose the mix, the brand of vodka you want, vegetables, if spicy, you can even add Shrimp.  Very fun project to build it and then see it all pretty and done at the table.\\n\\nAfter looking at the menu I decided to order the Eggs Benedict.  The poached eggs were a little bit over cooked but still flavors were amazing.  The muffin was perfectly toasted and easy to cut (I've had some that I needed a steak knife to do so). The homefries were seasoned and delicious, no need for ketchup, and the salad is a great add on to the dish to give it some light fresh taste.  \\nNow, as much as I liked this, I must recommend the Pulled Pork Scramble.  I usually stay away from \\"pulled pork\\" thinking it will be smothered in BBQ sauce but that is not the case her.  My friend ordered it, I tried it, and we both agreed that was the best thing that was brought to our table.  This one is a party of flavors in your mouth with bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, caramelized onions and homefries on the side.  Believe me, it's a must try.\\n\\nAt no point we were ever rushed, server allowed us to fully enjoy our meal, take our time and plates were brought out as soon as she knew we were done with the appetizer.  She was friendly, and great at making recommendations.  \\nThe manager also came by to make sure we had enjoyed our experience there.\\n\\nThe same way Stephanie's was recommended to us I will recommend to you.  \\nGreat food, service, ambiance...

There were about five other tables occupied with two servers running around taking orders, bringing out food for the patrons, and getting their bills. \\n\\nWe ordered...\\nThe matsaman curry with beef.  I was displeased that it didn't automatically come with rice and to add a small bowl of rice is $2.70.  I had my mind set on the curry and when the server asked me if I wanted to add rice I feel it's a little steep already paying $16 for the curry dish.  One simply cannot eat this curry without a carb!  The curry itself was delicious and came with lots of slices of beef, albeit almost every bite of beef was a little too chewy.  \\n\\nThe khao pad sapparod came out at the same time as my curry. The details of this dish entails \\"fresh pineapple, peanuts & raisins topped with pork floss & egg served in a fresh pineapple shell\\".  Lots of things off with this dish that we weren't told about.  Hardly fresh pineapple - few canned pieces at best. Peanuts were subbed for cashews.  No raisins.  Not fried with egg.  Not served in a fresh pineapple shell.  If you ask me, it's a completely different dish!  Hubby ordered this particularly because he likes his rice fried with an egg.  We complained to our server about the cashews/peanuts sub and the egg.  His excuse was that they haven't been frying the rice with egg for a very long time and they would have to make a new fried rice if he wanted it that way.  Well, yes.  It's why we ordered it.  Anyway, he took it back and brought it back 10 minutes later with some egg pieces.  And still the cashews.  At this point we were almost done sharing my curry dish so it wasn't worth another complaint.\\n\\nLuckily we had an entertainment book coupon we planned to use (buy one entree, get one free up to $15) so it was less painful in the end."},{"name":"Library Square","address":"300 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Okay for drinks but not much else. \\n\\nDon't think I've ever had a \\"Sunday roast\\" style anywhere else where the serve of beef is so blue it might as well still be mooing, roast vegetables that are so raw they still have that crisp crunch; the Yorkshire puddings and gravy were the only positive on the plate. \\n\\nUnlikely I'll ever choose to eat there again."},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere of this place is awesome, the outside area is definitely where you need to be.

The servers are awesome and the owner checks up on the tables offering suggestions if requested.\\n\\nFirstly, we noticed that the menus are dated, and I think they adjust it on a daily basis. We started out with a scotch egg (my husband's favorite!) from the bar menu (it's not on the dinner menu, but we heard they had them and couldn't resist). For all who have never heard of scotch eggs, it's a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage, battered and fried. Delicious!\\n\\nFor mains, I got the fish supper (fish and chips) and my husband got their version of bangers and mash (I can't think of the name they used). The fried fish was really fresh, with an optimal amount of batter, and served with french fries and mushy peas with mint. The ketchup at the Haven is also really fresh- it's made in house, in fact, as were the sausages. That's dedication!\\n\\nThe beer menu had some options that are worth checking out too. We didn't get a chance to eat dessert because we were so full from dinner, but I don't doubt that that would also be great, based on the rest of the meal. Overall, a solid 4 stars delicious.

You have your choice of meat, shrimp or tofu, and they will happily make it vegan for you (without the fish sauce) if you ask. \\n\\nA word of caution, though - when they say hot they mean it.

A couple of waitresses can bring drinks to tables on request.  The back area near the washrooms has a number of tables for quieter conversation.  A couple of pinball machines, foosball table and pool table can provide for a distraction from alcohol consumption and dancing to retro/80's music depending on which night you go.\\n\\nStaff/bartenders (4): Apparently one of their bar staff decided at some point that a vodka and 7-up is not a 'highball' and therefore doesn't qualify for their drink specials.  WTF?  To me this seemed odd (as well as to others I had mentioned it to).  Bouncers are friendly yet professional - I've never felt like I'm being sheep herded like some other vancouver bars.\\n\\nCrowd (4): Afterwork people + Hipsters + Students + Randoms + Birthday parties + People looking to get drunk...   there aren't a ton of frat boy / pickup guidos here.

The service is slow because there's only 1 waiter and 2 cooks, but even given the circumstances, they don't skimp on quality or politeness. The menus are awful--very ugly and I feel like they are undescriptive or lack menu items--and the booths suck because they can't support your weight if you lean on them. But nonetheless, the food was really good and the prices are unbeatable, most things are $6. Got a bacon eggs benedict (~$6) and banana pancakes (~$8). My boyfriend and I came in on MLK Monday and got a seat right away. Some parties came in after us and only waited maybe 10 minutes or so. It's more difficult if you have a large party though.

We moved to J.P. a little over 2 years ago, we tried the restaurant Zon's and enjoyed it and before we could try it a second time, it was closed! Fortunately the Haven has opened in Zon's old spot. In the few months it has been open, we have gone to the restaurant seven times, a record for us of any restaurant but especially amazing given the short time!\\n\\nWe have loved absolutely everything on this menu and have almost gone completely down the entire menu, we have had, beef & ale pie, haggis, duck masala, beet salad, \\"quackling\\" salad, barley rissotto, the scotch egg (my wife had this, I'm not that into eggs), tomato bridie, coronation chicken sandwich, sunchoke cullen skink, sassitch and mash, and all four of their deserts (our favorite is the shortbread with chocolate dipping cups, with just a pinch of chile pepper) ... Needless to say, we've loved everything and are probably going to clear the whole menu in its entirety very soon! Parts of the menu change from time to time which is just great in our opinion, as you get to try something new each time. \\n\\nThe staff is fantastic and the beers are delicious. My favorites are the Belgian Pale Ale and Belhaven Ale, my wife loves the harpoon wet hops. The joker IPA is also nice. If you like them on Facebook you can find out about various events and new beers coming out. They also give you some nice pickled vegetables and oatbread when you first sit down.

Our waitress was super knowledgable...almost to the point I thought  she was the chef! When she was describing the food, at first, I thought I was on The Food Network. Small plates meant for sharing.  Everything is locally sourced etc, blah blah blah. Some of the food is prepared by fermenting, dehydrating, and then making it into a powder. I thought to myself, \\"Good Lord, they spend more time talking about the food then making it.\\" I thought it just sounded way too hipster and fruh fruh at the same time. Well, let me tell you something...some of the best damn food I have ever eaten. All that fancy mixology, hipster local sourcing crap really pays off. I didn't know food could taste that good.\\n1. Acorn squash with some sort of nut butter etc....best thing ever. You wouldn't even know you were eating squash. It tasted hearty  and savory, it was thick like a steak. The skin was crispy. I just can't say enough about it. Do yourself a favor and get this please.\\n2. Warm potato salad with lamb. Wow!!!  Perfectly spiced, just enough acidity. The lamb was bite size and almost crispy.\\n3. I hate cauliflower, but we had some sort of cauliflower dish. The stalks were marinated and topped with the actual floweretts that had been fermented, dried and powdered.\\n4. Sunchokes with some sort of brown butter espuma. Never heard of a sunchoke. It has some characteristics of a sweet potato mixed with plantain but looks like ginger. Damn delicious, very damn delicious. \\n5. Blue Durham spaghetti. My least favorite as I though it was a bit too salty. But still good.\\nThen they also have a dim sum cart that comes around, you can choose small items from it.\\nWe had some sort of blackened glazed cauliflower, we had some shrimp crustini, a cous cous-like grain with a yogurt sauce.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and eat here!!!"},{"name":"Atmosphere Bistro","address":"1620 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love the ambience of restaurants in converted homes, and I love that I forget I'm in Atlanta when I dine in these kinds of restaurants ... although that doesn't mean I felt like I was in France either :) \\n\\nAmbience & service were wonderful, and the food was pretty good overall. Winners - the escargot \\"signature\\" appetizer which was highly recommended by our server. The garlic butter sauce really made that appetizer, and a great dipping sauce for the French bread. The puff pastry tart with goat cheese was pretty good, too, but nothing that special. For my entree, I got the \\"sauteed scallops w/ wild mushroom ravioli's and asparagus in Parmesan cheese & truffle emulsion\\". I loved the smoky flavor of the wild mushroom ravioli's the best - I thought the scallops were just ok, maybe almost boring. I was a little disappointed b/c this was among our server's recommended dishes - still, it was pretty good just a little pricey for something that was just pretty good for me ($26). I also sampled my friend's hangar steak - the porcini mushroom sauce really made that dish, but the steak itself was too chewy to me ... and that's probably why I'm not a fan of hangar steak. I also tried another friend's \\"mussels in creamy white wine & shallots broth\\" - that was very good but for me personally, I think I would get bored fast with a whole bowl of mussels. It would be a great dish for sharing though. For dessert, we shared the creme brulee - perfect & delicious, but really no different than any other creme brulee. Reading the other reviews, it looks like maybe we should've gotten the apple tart which was also recommended by our server.\\n\\nI don't think I would necessarily come back for the food but I'd definitely come back for the ambience - I think it's a perfect spot for a date."},{"name":"The Tavern at Camp Creek","address":"3560 Camp Creek Pkwy, Ste 110","city":"East Point","stars":"2","text":"Well after the disappointment of being told that we had to wait 45 mins last night to be seated at TGI Fridays, the wife and I decided to go ahead and grab something from here.

The shrimp special came with 4 large shrimp (fresh and perfectly cooked) with roasted vegetables on an arugula salad base with a wine/balsamic dressing and this was also delicious.  \\nPortions are pretty small though, considering what you're paying (Location premium at its finest.)"},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Judged only on beer and beer alone, this place gets a solid four stars!

Basically it just meant that all the tapas were $5 and each pitcher of sangria was $10. I mean, how can you beat that?? My friend made the reservation, and I was about 5 or so minutes late, so I can only assume the seating went smoothly because she was seated when I arrived. \\n\\nI really liked the atmosphere of the place, and we were seated next to this great painting that I believe had glow in the dark paint on it, because it was kind of sparkly in the light they had shining on it. It took a while for our waiter to come and bring us water and take our drink order, but that gave us ample time to look over the menu. When our waiter finally came to fill out water, my glass had a chip in it (which of course was exactly where I put my mouth, ouch!) so I asked for a new glass. I never got a new glass of water, but my friend shared with me so it was fine.\\n\\nWe all ordered our own tapas (two to three each) but we definitely shared amongst ourselves. We also ordered a pitcher of the red sangria and a pitcher of the white sangria. I'm a red girl, so the white was a little too sweet and orange juice-y for my tastes, but it was still pretty good. After ordering our tapas came out pretty rapid fire, which worked for me because I was extremely hungry! I really enjoyed the fried goat cheese with tortilla chips and my goat cheese empanadas were tasty as well. I also got the patatas bravas, but I felt like the sauce wasn't evenly distributed and wasn't spicy enough. Overall, the food was great, but the initial service was incredibly slow.

Copious is a huge, fine dining restaurant in the Brewery District.  There's about twenty parking spaces in back, which is nice when you are going down town.  Not having to pay for parking is such a bonus.  When we went inside, the restaurant was empty.  It was 5:00 on a Sunday, and the main reason we went there was to watch the Bobby Floyd Trio (traditional jazz) in the underground live music venue named \\"Notes\\" (copious notes).  Bobby Floyd tours nationally with the Count Basie Orchestra, and he was out of town this time, but I'll get back to that.\\n   On Sunday, there was happy hour up at the bar in the restaurant section of Copious.  Happy hour on a Sunday?  That's as rare as spotting big foot!  My wife and I ordered several half off happy hour appetizers, like stemmed mussels and egg rolls.  They were tasty and ended up being the perfect amount of food.  Wine, beer, and local spirits were also happy hour priced, so I enjoy a few Watershed and Oyo bourbons on the rocks.  She had red wine, which she seemed pleased with.\\n     We then went down stairs to Notes.  Tickets to see the Bobby Floyd Trio (piano, bass, and drums) were $8 a piece for general admission.  Boy was that a deal!  The club is what you'd envision in your mind.  With a very \\"speak easy\\" vibe, it was classy, with lots of bistro tables and booths.  You can reserve seats for an extra price, but we thought we'd chance it.  Bobby Floyd was not there that night, because he was traveling with the Count Bassie Band.  His replacement on piano did not disappoint.  It was such an intimate experience, that even a casual jazz listener would enjoy it.  The cocktail waitresses were on point.

It's small inside with limited seating, but there is outside seating as well.  The d√©cor is adorable...they have a periodic table of cheese on the wall for Pete's sake!  The manager is very friendly and he makes a point to stop by every table to ask how things are.  They offer curbside pickup, which is nice, as it can get quite crowded inside.  I've been here a couple times now and as far as the food goes, certain things I liked, others I didn't.  They offer a selection of different grilled cheeses and a selection of different burgers.  They also have a separate vegan menu!  Here is a breakdown of what I've tried...\\n\\nTruffle Melt Grilled Cheese:\\nMy absolute favorite!  It's creamy, cheesy, truffley goodness!  Havarti, truffle oil, arugula and ground pepper - that's it.  Some of the other grilled cheeses have a little too much going on, so I really enjoy the simplicity of this one.\\n\\nThe Big Cheese:\\nVery rich, but good.  Jack, muenster and white cheddar cheeses with arugula.  I haven't tried the tomato soup dipper yet, but I bet that would go great with this one.\\n\\nBlackberry Melt Grilled Cheese:\\nJust okay.  Fontina, bacon, blackberry mash and arugula.  The bacon and blackberry overpower the cheese.  Plan on getting lots of blackberry seeds stuck in your teeth if you have this one.\\n\\nSouthern Comfort Burger:\\nJust okay.  Burger topped with cheddar, bacon, BBQ sauce and mac & cheese.  Tasted like a standard BBQ bacon cheeseburger.  A little greasy, nothing special.  I was expecting the mac & cheese to put it over the top, but their mac & cheese is bland and there wasn't much on the burger to begin with.\\n\\nTruffle Oil and Rosemary Fries:\\nDelish!!  The truffle and rosemary go perfect together.  Any time I've ordered these fries they've been perfectly salted and crispy.  A definite must.\\n\\nToasted's Mac & Cheese:\\nSadly their mac & cheese fails to deliver.  It comes out with a layer of almost burnt crust on the top of it.  Not only does it look off-putting, but it tasted so as well.  The actual mac & cheese underneath was very bland.  The description says it has jarlsberg, extra sharp cheddar and gruyere cheeses, but surprisingly I didn't get much cheese flavor in the sauce at all...tasted more like a roux to me.\\n\\nFree Style Soda:\\nI love, love the soda machine!  It has a touch screen...first you pick your soda (all Coke products), then you pick a flavor shot to add to it.   Apparently these machines are all over, but I've never seen before.  So needless to say, I was giddy like a little kid while choosing my flavor combo!  I think my favorite concoction so far is Sprite with Peach.\\n\\nOverall I'm a fan of Toasted.

Davis Square being one of them.  About 10:30 this morning I decided I was hungry and ventured out for something - I just didn't know what I wanted.  So I aimlessly let my car take me to Davis Square.  Somehow I made my way to Diesel Cafe - even though I don't like coffee.\\n\\nRight off the bat I was impressed,  the counter service was pleasant and helpful.  I explained to them I didn't drink coffee and I was given alot of tasty options with tea.  I opted for a drink that doesn't have a name - it was just 1/2 iced tea and 1/2 lemonade.  Surprisingly  it was very light and refreshing.  They also had Raspberry Lime Ricky's and a Limeade Tea, and an interesting Hot Cocoa  which sounded great - I'll be back for these.  For eats I chose the Little Piston which was Mozzarella, Tomato, Greens, and Pesto on a baguette.  Very light, the pesto was not over powering and the sandwhich was built so things don't oooze out.  They also had a nice selection of muffins, scones and bagels if you wanted something lighter.\\n\\nFrom the looks of the menu coffee drinkers will be very happy.  They had a nice selection that even a non - coffee drinker was drooling from the descriptions.  The sandwich selection was equally tasty that  I know my picky - comfort with what I know attitude will be put to a test.  \\n\\nLooked fun as well - pool tables, couches, photo booth all looked inviting.  They do have wireless which is a plus and pretty reasonable prices $4.95 hour, $7.95 for the day and there is a monthly charge too.  There is also some artwork from a local artist that can be bought.  I was pretty surprised that the prices were so reasonable - some I may go back for a second look.  The art was priced much better than Flampoeria where you could look, but never in this lifetime afford.\\n\\nThese are the days I wish I had a personal lap top as I would have chilled there for a few hours.  Instead I spent about an hour and read and just relaxed.  I will  be back here to visit.  I like that they can open up the windows for outdoor seating, and I love the back with the couches - very cozy for some winter time chllin.  :)"},{"name":"Roaming Goat Coffee","address":"849 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"When traveling, it is hard to always find the comforts you expect at home.

I don't know what it is about them, but they are just so damn good. They're far from the giant greasy rolls you get at Chinese restaurants, but delicate, crunchy rolls that come with the perfect sauce. \\n\\nBesides that, I like how they provide dishes that are a little more original than your standard Thai fare. The Tofu in the Pot for one is something I haven't been able to find anywhere else, and it's absolutely perfect for a cold winter day - a gingery soup packed with a ton of vegetables and glass noodles and served, as its name would suggest, in a ceramic pot. My biggest complaint is that vegetarian options are pretty limited. They only really have one noodle dish that's specifically just vegetables and tofu, and all the others have meat. On the other hand, they have always been willing to substitute on their main dishes - I've often ordered the Pad Thai and just asked for tofu instead of chicken and shrimp. Still, I do wish their menu was a little more vegetarian friendly. The service is a little impersonal, but I also have never had a bad experience with it.\\n\\nThey've recently started offering a lunch menu as well (or maybe it wasn't so recent and I just haven't been here for lunch in a while).

We let our waiter know that the food was pretty gross at the end of the meal because we didn't see him once he dropped the cold gross food off.   Then we waited for the check and when the waiter presented it he then disappeared, I asked the hostess to ring up the purchase she was again bewildered and said I can go find your waiter and ask him to come to you.  Oh ok thats so not of any help.  Finally, we paid and was told by our waiter that the manager was toooooo bussssssy to come to our table.  Gee what was he doing?? Overall I have to say it was one of the worst food experiences I've had in a long time.  Do not go there at lunch, service is poor at best, food quality is less than poor and it takes over an hour and a half from start to finish.  I dont have that leisurely of a lunch break, do you??  Is there less than a ONE star rating?  Close this dump and put something we can enjoy."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Some of the better BBQ in the city! Great atmosphere too. We had pork belly and brisket- both very delicious. The biscuits are also out of this world! Mac and cheese- not so much. It was a touch too thick and creamy. Half a star off for that. Half a star also off because the prices are pretty hefty for BBQ- but I know part of that is cuz of location (and people are willing to pay...). Another star off because they charge a 3% \\"appreciation fee\\" that goes to the BOH employees. While I think it's a great idea, I also think it could be done other ways. One way is to increase their wage 3%! I'm sure they're making good overhead on the food and even more so with the liquor! If they had to, I would much prefer them increasing the price of food by 3% instead of flaunting the idea that they care for their BOH employees, but would much rather have that cost come directly from the consumer. \\n\\nBut seriously.

I really appreciate restaurants that have 'sampler' plates where I can try a bunch of different stuff in one entree, so I chose the Couscous Carthage - steamed couscous, chicken, lamb, merguez and autumn vegetables in tomato sauce. It was pretty good. Service was good. Music was light and jazzy and Frenchy but not offensively so.\\n\\nAlthough this is indeed a unique dining experience, the food won't knock your socks off. Desserts \\"all made on site\\" but still overpriced. I could get that tart in a deli for half the price.

Unless the restaurant is across-the-board awful, the dishes are (usually) cheap enough and (usually) plentiful enough that something's going to stick after a few rounds of experimentation.  It's a culinary game of darts, yo.\\n\\nTasca's bullseye is easier to hit than a couple places I've been to, although there are a couple other factors bringing it down to just an above-average recommendation (which would be 3 1/2 stars--when, oh when, do we get to use half-stars in our ratings, Yelp?!)  I found the zing-less sangria about par for the course (and the glasses were too small); a good palate-cleanser, nothing more.  The waiter was very quick to refill our glasses of water, however, and in general was speedy and accurate in dealing with a party of five on a Saturday night.\\n\\nOn to dishes:  the chorizo was skimpy on the actual sausage, but nonetheless had a bold flavor that permeated even the tomatoes in the stew (watch me use big culinary verbs!).  Two potato products were quite edible, the quiche-like slice of pie moreso than the dish of dressed-up home fries (watch me NOT use the Spanish names for any of these, as j'etudi√© fran√ßais dans la lycee!  Zut!)\\n\\nPork tenderloin was a little tougher than I wanted, but the gravy was nice and savory.  My veggie-oriented girlfriend tells me those goat cheese empanadas are a good night out, although we may have both liked the bread better: warm and soft, with this orange-colored butter that was smooth and spreadable.  \\n\\nThe hands-down winner for me had to be the sizzling shrimp, a scampi-like skillet with big flecks of garlic in the bottom of its tiny little pan.  That delicious item, at $7.50, was the most expensive of everything we had, and had we been splitting this five ways (one person paid), I'll wager we'd all have escaped with our wallets intact.  Hooray.\\n\\nAbout the biggest negative would have to be the lighting, which is great if you're bringing a particularly ugly date out, but is not otherwise too conducive to either conversation or dish identification.

Then you eat a third of it, get full, and feel sad about the price you paid.  At least, that was my experience.\\n\\nI ordered a chicken piada with spicy sauce.  The employee behind the counter threw a lot of sauce on that sucker.  That's usually fine with me, because I like a lot of sauce, but then I asked for just a small amount of the pesto sauce as well.   I held up my hand and pinched my fingers together in the universal sign for \\"very tiny.\\"  Either my pal Mr. Saucy wasn't looking, or just didn't care, because he turned the bottle of pesto upside-down, and squeezed at least half a cup of it onto my meal.  Also, he didn't shake it first, and the oil in pesto sauce usually separates out so that it's floating at the top.  So really, I got half a cup of vaguely pesto-flavored oil.  Wouldn't it have been more logical to put on a very small amount (after shaking the bottle of course) and then ask the customer, \\"Would you like any more?\\"\\n\\nThe Piada itself was alright, but the chicken was gristly and the whole three pound monstrosity was leaking more oil than BP.

I went to El Arroyo for the first time last night with a group of friends for happy hour. They all raved about this place and their Thursday $1 margarita happy hour. So I went and 6 margaritas later I wasn't even buzzed.  Now you may be thinking, \\"wow, this girl may just have a drinking problem,\\" and part of that may be true. But the margaritas tasted like watered down lime water and could not have had more than a thimble full of tequila in them. After the first one I told my friends I wanted to try a Mexican Martini, but they insisted that the margaritas would soon catch up on me. Never happened, they just made me have to pee a lot. Oh, plus my friend sitting next to us was served a margarita with black flecks floating in it. Looked like pepper but who knows why is was there and how many other drinks came out like that? \\nNow to the food. Chips and salsa were mediocre at best. Nothing too great, probably fast food quality. And the menu boasted a variety of yummy SOUNDING dishes. So I asked the waitress what the best thing on the menu was and she said it was the stuffed zucchini. It comes out as a semi-raw split zucchini topped some extremely bland shredded chicken mixed with tomato sauce and melted cheese on top. Now I am a girl that loves my food and I don't like to share, but I shared this with my husband just to get rid of it. What everyone else ordered looked just about on par with my meal too.

I appreciated its consistency and that it was slight chunky but it needed more tomatoes, onion, jalape√±os, salt ....pretty much everything else to cut the excessive lime. I had the master Yuzu to drink and this their version of a margarita and so you can only imagine the sourness of the drink and then the appetizer I was not enjoying this at all.

The tortilla was grilled to perfection and the chicken was extremely flavorful and there was plenty of chicken to where you did not feel like you had  two bites of your taco and no more chicken. The Baja shrimp was alright, it has the same guacamole inside so it was just ok to me. The price per taco is $4 which is reasonable and the plus is that our food came out quick. At the end we ended up ordering the churro dessert, the ice cream tasted like it was homemade and then when you mix it with sugar from the churros, absolutely delicious.

Secondly, they need to find a home for their sauce jars. It's a hassle to ask the staff by the cashier for the sauces because they have to get it from their fridge and it's awkward to ask customers for the jars on their table. Either all tables need to have sauces (like ketchup at burger joints) or they need an accessible \\"home\\" for extra jars of sauces. \\n\\nIf you're from OHSU and want to grab something for lunch, make sure to call 30 minutes in advance and place a to-go order.

This is an establishment with three other locations owned by the same company and it already has the disconnected feel of a chain restaurant. For instance, upon ordering a whiskey mixed w/ ginger ale and soda water the bartender looked more like a chemist using a shot glass to measure which made for an extremely weak drink and one that tasted strange. The soda water does not come out of a bottle but out of a tap and it tasted funky.\\n\\nNext was the deer-in-the-headlights moment when I asked to substitute oysters for clams in the seafood tower. Most places will allow it with either no upcharge or a minimal one. However, our server was dumbstruck and initially indicated change was not possible until I suggested I would pay for the substitute. To be fair, the server in question did a fine job, was affable, and attentive throughout so no issues with her. It's the corporate rigidity of the place (i.e. measured shots) like when we asked for medium rare plus and were told that it's either medium rare or medium. Quick memo to Bancroft...it's 2018 and in the world of fine dining + is a thing. Of course, one of the two steaks came out not just medium rare...or rare but Pittsburgh (rarer than rare...still mooing). It was sent back and returned....medium rare plus! \\n\\nThe bill for two came to $290 before tip but that included a half bottle of wine ($49), three drinks, seafood tower, meal and one desert. Their prices are in keeping with restaurants in the fine dining realm but here are a few more problems. The cold lobster in the tower had a stale taste which some might suspect that it was frozen but I can't imagine that they would freeze their lobster tails at that price point. It had a bland, flavorless taste. The hit of the entire meal was the citrus cooked shrimp with butter on the side. The steaks were good, not memorable. \\n\\n\\nIf you've read nothing else, consider this when dining at Bancroft at the mall. Why would anyone spend this kind of money only to be surrounded by diners/shoppers who arrive in T-shirts and sandals? If this was the only fine dining game in town then maybe you make allowances but with Pellana and Alto Forno within a stone's throw it doesn't make sense to go here. This restaurant is designed to cater to the shoppers and not cultivate a regular audience. If the Bancroft loosens up their rules and imposes a bare minimum dress code (no sandals) then it might be worth a second look."},{"name":"The Haven","address":"2 Perkins St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4.5","text":"Went late last night for a beer and a snack.

Duck tacos come with shrimp chips which is flavourless. Move onto entree, we had the \\"famous\\" chicken & ribs combo, the lamb shank and the risotto.

Each entree dish comes with a kale salad which is salty, and mash potato which tastes weird, feel like too much cream in there or something, couldn't even taste the starchy potato.\\n2. They charged us for something we did not order. What happened was we asked the server what they have for dessert, she said they only have one dessert which is a chocolate brownie top with minty whipped cream and raspberry, pecan. We did not order. Then we asked if they do something special request since it was my friend's birthday *we pointed at him*. She said she would ask the kitchen. After like 5-10 minutes, the owner himself brought out the brownie dessert and sang happy birthday out loud. A little surprised, but we say thank you we appreciated it. We all tried that one brownie and everyone stopped at first bites. It tasted like a store bought brownie, it's hard like it just got taken out of the freezer, and it was way too sweet. But then we thought it's ok since it's complimentary. No, we ended up got charged for that one dessert for $10.95. We did not want to ruin the night so we just paid for it without saying anything.

I can't speak to it recently because I never tried it again after having one of the most dry and flavorless pizzas of my life a couple years back.  The atmosphere on the inside also kind of sucks.  I think my grandma has those chairs in her dining room.  On the other hand, I like it out on the patio.  This may, sadly, be the closest thing to a beergarden that Boston has to offer.  As others have pointed out the service can sometimes be hit or miss. \\n\\nBut all that aside, the real reason to come is for good quality local brewing, and CBC mostly hits the mark.  I don't usually bother but the house beers, particularly the amber, are pretty good versions of those styles.  The real stars are their limited and seasonal releases.  If you ever see the imperial stout \\"youenjoymystout\\", get it immediately.  It's seriously as good or better than some of the truly mega-hyped IRS'es like Dark Lord and Abyss. I think their barleywines are also solid, as are some of their sours, particularly \\"Rose de Cambrinus\\". \\n\\nCBC also throws some great special events which I wholeheartedly recommend.

I went for a late dinner with my sister, and the weather was phenomenal so we decided to sit on the sidewalk patio. Being in the Fenway and only a few blocks from the stadium, the people watching alone makes this a great spot. The mood is very laid back: think wooden benches, plastic cups, tin trays, and country music touches. I loved the vintage Dolly Parton photographs in the bathroom, and was so disappointed to see a sign indicating that one had been stolen. Who does that? Respect your city and its restaurants.\\n\\nWe both got cocktails, a jalape√±o mezcal for her and a somehow spicy blueberry, vodka, and prosecco mix for me, and they were excellent. Strong, flavorful, refreshing, and decently sized for the price: $12 for a 16oz cup with ice. She insisted on getting a \\"bucket\\" of biscuits as a starter, which includes four perfectly laminated, flaky, home style biscuits and honey butter. Not too heavy, not too buttery: just right. One was enough before the meal, and they were excellent the next day. We each ordered the smallest tray: one meat, one hot scoop, and one cold scoop. I got pulled pork, mac and cheese, and watermelon salad. She had four huge pieces of fried chicken, mac and cheese, and their garden salad with brussel sprouts. It was barbecue bliss. The pork was juicy, perfectly cooked, and didn't need any extra sauce. The mac and cheese is what we call in the south \\"make you wanna smack your momma\\" good. Gooey, garlicky, and with a perfect breadcrumb crust. The watermelon salad was the only slight let down, as it was simply a slice of delectable watermelon covered with cilantro and cheese. I ate the fruit on its own, and only half the rest of my meal, which reheated into a great dinner for the next day.\\n\\nService was very friendly, and our waiter even went the extra mile of boxing each of our individual ingredients in separate containers. But since we stayed until closing and the doors were locked to prevent new patrons (read: drunken Sox fans) from storming the bar after the game, it was a bit hard to flag him down for the check. After tip our two drinks, appetizer, and two entrees totaled $100, so it's certainly not cheap eats.

It definitely adds a touch of class to Westerville.\\nThe decor is really nice. The food was well prepared. I loved the Brussel sprout appetizer. The reasons for only 3 stars are as follows. Most everything on the menu felt overvalued. Very good food does not mean the sky is the limit on what you can charge. I tried the filet. It was very good, but over priced for what was included. Even if the food is very good, being over priced will cause most people to think twice about frequent returns if at all. The options on the menu are also too limited. Anyone with more basic tastes will find very little if anything on the menu they would enjoy. This eliminates going to dinner here when you have a picky family member or even children. I know personally I would have enjoy a more basic salad which was not a choice, so I went with out a salad. Normally this would have been an additional sale which they missed out on. I don't know first hand, but my understanding is they don't offer free refills on sodas etc. A big no no in this day and age and especially as expensive as their menu is. I was also really disappointed they didn't offer some type bread before dinner. You just expect that nowadays, again, especially as expensive as their menu is.

The chicken also had amazing flavor and sat atop the stellar waffle giving it a little but of its savory season. Slam dunk!

I'm not sure how they get business when they don't bother to seat us or take our order. It was my first time here, and I was a split second from walking out. 15 minutes, no line, empty tables, and no host or waiter in sight 0.0 How are people even here right now?\\n\\nMy dinnermate was in some serious need for some sinus-relieving hot soup, so that was the only reason we stayed. Finally when we're seated, the waiter drops off a menu, and we stare hardcore confused. Oh dang, is this only an all-you-can-eat? Errr...How does this work? Keep reading. \\n\\nApparently there are 2 menus: one for AYCE and one for ordering per serving (you know what I mean. Like a normal menu...ish) You have to specifically ask for the normal menu though, so for you first-timers, know that you have the hidden option. $21 for AYCE per person is hard to spend too casually, especially surrounded by almost poor college students (almost poor because it's West Campus). Alternatively, $21+ for just soup and one choice of meat and noodle (divided by 2 for two people). The latter doesn't seem *that* bad, but that's the bare backbone of soup, so if you want another meat or veggies, it'll start adding up. If you do want this option, I'd recommend to go with 3-4 people. Plenty of food to go around without panicking about the price. $3 for napa cabbage... Hold on. *Makes a trip to HEB* While it's hard to justify that in my head when we're ordering, they really do give you a good amount though (refer to pictures). And no, it's not just cognitive dissonance. The two of us were overly stuffed by the end. \\n\\nSoup bases: original or spicy or both. Not a galore of choices, but we were still happy with the broths. I like the original more because the Sichuanese seed in the spicy broth has a sharp taste to it. You'll know if you accidentally bite into one. It's not \\"spicy\\" as in ghost peppers, but it'll sting your mouth in a different way (subtle hint of a personal taste aversion). Relevant tangent: I think I might be actually allergic to something in the spicy broth? Not sure my skin is supposed to burn when I eat or muscles tense... good thing I like the original more :X *nervous laughter* The dinnermate liked the spicy, so I can't hate too much. \\n\\nThe soup ended up being decent, but the service had been bad enough to mar the dinner experience. Still, there aren't really hot pot places to compete with, so I might come back with a pout if service doesn't get better. \\n\\nPS: That's Vietnamese music in the background of the Mongolian/Chinese hot pot place :P"},{"name":"The Imperial","address":"726 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"The Imperial had been getting good recommendations in our circle and what we could see online.

Although the outside of the building isn't anything impressive, the inside is nice, decently decorated, and clean.  When we met with someone to go on a tour we were told that the upstairs ballroom had a reception going on and the lower ballroom was getting set up for an evening reception.  I assumed that meant we wouldn't get to see the upstairs ballroom.  However, we were ushered right into the back of someone else's wedding reception despite telling her we would rather not intrude on someone's reception.  The quick tour of the facility took fewer than ten minutes.  Overall we got the feel of 103 West is a wedding mill where they pack as many weddings into each day as they can possibly fit without regard for how comfortably they would fit.  Later that night we were told someone would be using a cramped and messy office as a bridal suite because there would be another wedding upstairs using the alternate space.  Also, the person who gave us the tour suggested we use the valet parking.  That seemed odd to me because I believe when you book there you have to pay extra for offering valet.  If we had used it that would have meant the people whose reception we were ushered into would have paid for our parking.  It just seemed tacky to me.  The last thing I will mention is that when we went through the lower ballroom we saw one of the cakes 103 West prepared and it left a lot to be desired; sloppy white buttercream smeared on a few tiers with some sloppy designs piped on in white buttercream.

My daughter was dying for Chicken Marsala. Just a huge mistake. The restaurant was really loud as all those big box places are. We hate that. I'm not sure why they design them that way, unless it's to turn tables. We asked the hostess to sit us someplace quiet. She tried to sit us right in front of the kitchen.  I don't know if she was ignoring our request or if she just couldn't hear us.   We asked for a table farther towards the back behind the booths hoping that would filter some of the noise.  I was having trouble deciding what I wanted and asked the waitress for recommendations.  She probably spit out the names of half the menu in true machine gun fashion. Take note servers, when someone asks for a recommendation we want to know what you especially like. Not the most expensive thing on the menu on down (unless that is what you especially like).  But no more than three things, one for meat or poultry, pasta, and seafood.  I already have the full menu in front of me, please help me limit my options. Anyway my daughter had the Chicken Marsala, I had the Chicken Carrabba, and my spouse had the lasagna.   Everything came out kind of on the cool side. My Chicken Carrabba was dry, and really unimpressive. The Marsala was really a joke. Aside from not really being hot, it came on a big white plate with the chicken all the way over on one side and the glop of mashed potatoes all the way over on the other. I think they were afraid they wouldn't play well together.  I get that restaurants skip the garnish these days to save money. What I don't get is why they think presentation is not important at all.

The cheese cart is incredible and the presentation of it is also a treat in itself. Tip for the locals... The staff knows exactly where you can find each cheese locally so you can get your slice of heaven in larger quantities for much cheaper, just ask them! The lobster bisque is true bisque. I am salivating just writing about it! Salads are tasty, and steaks and sauces are top quality! Before my teaching career, I opened up a couple of fine dining steakhouses, so I know what quality meat looks and tastes like. The lobster tail is enormous and extremely tender. Finally, the chocolate souffl√© is oh so delicious! Just make sure to order 30 minutes in advance to allow time to bake. While this restaurant is pricey, it is worth every penny!

We walked in for a table of 4 and were immediately seated. Although it's not a fancy place as indicated by the paper dinner napkins vs the cloth napkins, the food always comes out hot, tasty, and quick. We had the salted fish with tofu, kung pao chicken, snow leaf tips, and intestines with sour vegetables to share. The intestines were fried which we didn't expect. To me, it seems safer to eat it that way anyway. The Chinese sour vegetable was perfect with the dish balancing out the strong flavor of the intestines. The salty fish reminds me of childhood when I used to go with my grandmother to pick them up whole on the steet markets and she would cook it for the family in China. The snow leaf tips were so nice and crunchy. The only complaint I had was the hot and sour soup. It lacked a good amount of the chunky veggies you find from other Chinese restaurants.

The truth is that it is very common for Japanese restaurants (that are Japanese owned at least) to close one day a week, and they often choose a weekday because weekends are always busy.  A ramen shop is the quintessential small business, and it's often the owner in the kitchen making your meal.  I understand it's frustrating when businesses are not open, but then again I also understand the world doesn't revolve around me.  \\n\\nWith that out of the way, Motomachi is a place I would most definitely recommend to anyone seeking an authentic and tasty bowl of ramen.  I've seen a lot of comparisons with Kintaro, and would like to point out that Motomachi was opened and is run by the same owner as Kintaro.  The main difference between the two is that Motomachi ramen is all composed from a chicken stock, rather than a pork stock as is the case at Kintaro.  The result is a much lighter (and healthier) bowl of ramen that won't leave you feeling stuffed like Kintaro - whether that's a good thing or not is up to you.\\n\\nI am normally a lover of miso ramen, and enjoy both types of miso ramen offered at Motomachi, but if miso ramen is your calling, then I have to say Kintaro is king.  What I love about Motomachi is their Shio and Shoyu ramen - both are light, delicate, balanced, and flavorful.  In fact, I don't think you can get a better bowl of shio or shoyu ramen in the city, and both remind me a  lot of Tokyo where these bowls of ramen are most popular.  \\n\\nLike Kintaro, the restaurant is rather small, so don't go in groups and be prepared to possibly wait.  The interior is clean and modern in my opinion, about as nice as you can make a 500 square foot ramen shop look. \\n\\nI definitely recommend giving Motomachi a go, a must for any Vancouver foodie."},{"name":"The Lobster Stop","address":"723 Washington St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"The best seafood on the south shore.

When a worker finally walked by I asked him what it was and he said \\"goat\\".  I told him the sign said chicken, he went and checked then came back to apologize.  I am not sure if it was undercooked or simply did not agree with me.  Goat is not something I Would ever willingly eat.  I was a bit upset but was not about to make a big thing out of it.

The ambiance is cool and cute- they definitely make the space work for them, because there are a bunch of tables for such a small space but you still don't feel crowded. The periodic table of cheese is cute and I learned quite a bit- which is actually not surprising because I've been allergic to dairy since birth so I don't have much cheese experience. The people are also super nice and bubbly, so customer service is an A+.\\nKeep in mind, I'm coming from a vegan perspective here- of what I've heard the regular grilled cheese sandwiches are the bomb-diggity (I said it, what.), as proven by my husband who inhaled his sandwich (while yelping) before I got a third bite in of mine. I was very pleased to see they had a separate vegan menu, that was an awesome touch, and to find out they make their vegan cheese in house (with a coconut milk base). So I ordered the Vegan 101 because duh, it's my first time. My husband got the Blackberry Melt. After the obligatory pictures for yelp (you're welcome Andi), we dove in. I didn't have any expectations but when I took the first bite it was.... meh. Just really bland. And I could tell the bread had flavor, but it just seemed like the vegan cheese didn't have any flavor at all. I had my husband take a bite thinking \\"maybe this is just what grilled cheese is like?\\" but he also agreed that white it seemed similar to regular cheese, it was a very very mild flavor. I sprinkled some salt on it to see if that would help and it did a bit but between doing all that and the tomato slices, the middle was so soggy it was falling apart. I always thought/saw grilled cheese sandwiches as being crunchy, so I guess since the vegan cheese was so good at staying melted, it made everything but the crust soggy. \\nIt was a little bit of a bummer, as I've had flavorful slices of Daiya brand cheese in recipes before, but this won't stop me from coming in and giving a different vegan sandwich another try for sure.

You don't have to go through the entire showroom in order to get what you need! I'm surprised so many people aren't aware of this.  If all you need is Marketplace stuff (kitchen, bathroom, textiles, art or storage stuff) you can hit the 'secret passageway' from the main entrance or go in backwards through the Exit and scoot right over without having to traipse through the confounding showroom upstairs.\\n\\n2. Use the website before you go!  Ikea now lists the warehouse Aisle and Unit location info for every product on their website, so you really don't need to go through the entire showroom if you already know you want a black Expedit 4 x4 shelf.  Search for Availability of the product on Ikea.ca and the warehouse info you need is right there. It also saves you driving all the way to Richmond if what you really need is in Coquitlam or is not available at all.\\n\\nHappy Ikea-ing :)"},{"name":"The Imperial","address":"726 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I'm in love with this place!

This is to my way of thinking the epitome of fried squid dishes. I try the fried squid every where I go, Italian or Chinese or any other cuisine, and it always fall short of Canton Cook's Salt & Pepper Squid.  Always crispy, and lightly golden brown, and never greasy, cooked to perfection. And the \\"breading\\" (I really don't know what it's composed of) always coats every tasty little morsel uniformly. From the first bite to the last.  My only critique - more jalape√±o slices please. The combination of the slightly salty fried squid and the capsicum of the pepper produces an amazing taste when consumed together.\\nWarsu Duck. Simply put this crispy duck dish is the bomb!  The duck breast meat with tasty crispy skin on, is sliced and placed on top of the saut√©ed vegetables, so it stays delightfully crispy from first delicious bite to the last.\\n\\nTrust me, everything on the menu is excellent and you won't be disappointed, but if you go with the two dishes I mention above you will be as pleased as I am."},{"name":"Island Fin Poke Company","address":"1450 Tuskawilla Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"I really like this place and hope it succeeds!

This location is listed as a 24-hour restaurant both online and on the door, and all lights were on inside the business and signs.

Several customers were eating in the restaurant. After approximately three minutes of standing there without acknowledgement, the girl sweeping floors stopped and approach me to inform me that the store was closed at that time because there were no servers. I asked if my party could be seated at the bar and she spoke to the manager. This question should have been a simple yes-or-no, but their conversation lasted approximately another minute. At that point, unsatisfied by the demeanor of the employees, I left.

Afterward 3 of us decided to go to breakfast.  We ended up at IHOP.  We asked for separate checks.  I ordered steak and eggs.  Sadly my steak was served to me raw and ultimately the manager offered to comp the steak off my check.  I did not request this and let the manager know I was willing to pay for the steak (as a new one was delivered to me & was cooked properly).   She insisted to take it off.  My check came to $3.78 & I left $1.00 for a tip.  I paid with a debit card (as did the other 2 people at the table).  \\nThis morning I used my card with no troubles.  When I came home, I balanced my checkbook.  Knowing my account was running a bit low (Tuesday is payday...yay!), I called the bank to check my balance.  I had enough to get to work until payday as well as get a couple of things I needed at the store.  When I tried to pay for my items at the store, my card was declined twice, much to my embarrassment.  I left without my items.  Once I got home, I called the bank and was told that I know only have $1.56 in my account.  This left me without enough money to get to work for the next 2 days!!  I decided to check the last few transactions against the receipts in my wallet.  All but 3 balanced and checked out.  I had a receipt for a transaction that wasn't listed (my $3.78 w/ tip).  Then I had 2 charges on my card for amounts that were not mine; one for $7.22 and another for $12.00.  I called the bank and inquired further.  Surprisingly, all three transactions were from IHOP.  The charge for $7.22 was listed as pending for 3/17.  The $12.00 charge posted earlier today, apparently after I called to check my balance earlier.  I spoke with a customer service rep & filed the necessary paperwork.  \\nMy next step was to call the restaurant itself.  I asked for a manager and was told there wasn't one on duty.  Only a server left in charge after the manager left.  I told him what happened and he basically said there wasn't anything that he could do since it was the weekend and he wasn't really a manager.  I told him this was something that needed to be handled NOW as this constitutes fraud.  He said the only thing he could think to do was call the manager at home who was with her 2 children. Was this supposed to make me feel bad about requesting help?  I told him I did feel bad about potentially interrupting her evening but this was a bit of a serious predicament and yes I would like him to call her.  He agreed to do so, at the same time telling me he would try to have someone call me sometime tomorrow morning.  I stopped him and let him know that someone needed to call me back this evening, even if it was him to let me know he couldn't get a hold of anyone.  He reluctantly agreed to do so within one hour.  Approximately 15 minutes later he called to let me know he left a message for his manager and was waiting for a return call.  He also wanted to let me know that this was a simple mistake and it would be taken care of, so not to worry.  I felt like I was being placated.  I let him know it did not feel like an arbitrary incident but rather like retaliation for the undercooked steak situation.  He denied this and let me know there was no way this was possible.  I asked for a number to the corporate office.  His response was to let me know that he would call as soon as he heard from his manager.\\nAnother 15 or so minutes passed and he returned my call.  He said the manager called and said she would make it her first priority tomorrow morning as it was late on a Sunday evening and there wasn't much she could do.  He continued to throw out a variety of explanations as to what could have happened.  Server error, honest mistake, technology.  He even blamed the consumers for having access to technology and the ability to check their bank account info 24 hours a day.  He again said the manager would call me first thing in the morning and if not I could call her.  He instructed me to let her know that I was mad (which he claimed she already knew).  I was also told that she would do whatever it took to make it up to me: return my money, give me free food, comp cards, whatever I wanted.  Again, this was offered to me without my requesting it.  All I asked for was to have the correct amount charged to my card and the incorrect ones deleted.  \\nThis is how the evening has ended.  I will update this post as to what happens as soon as anything changes.  \\nIn the meantime, protect your credit card info!!"},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Tonight I was coming in to Cactus with a family member and an out of town guest.

I wasn't too hungry, but remembered liking The Haven, so I brought a book and the desire for a drink and light fare.

It's a small, back-room attached to the main bar area, seating about a dozen to a dozen and a half.  There's a string of small tables that can be pushed together, and a small booth that sits 4 comfortably.  The other tables were a bit narrow, both length and width, such that putting two plates on the table made things cramped.  If the tables were 6-9 inches longer, I don't think that would reduce the space in the room significantly, but would provide more eating area.  The room itself was pretty basic, but nice.  I appreciate \\"adult only\\" space, where I don't need to worry about young children running around, etc.\\n\\nFood Quantity - We both ordered a main entr√©e, shared a side, as well as a dessert.  My wife ordered the hanger steak, which was a bit petite; I ordered the rib-eye, and it was a good sized cut.  The side we ordered (chic peas, lemon zest, some type of seed/nut, in molasses) was a decent size, plenty for us to share.  I'm always perplexed by tiny portioned desserts on oversized plates, it just accentuates the diminutive serving size.  \\n\\nFood Quality - Everything was delicious!  My wife ordered the blue cheese side with her steak, which was delectable.  I ordered my rib eye medium, it was expertly cooked, and well seasoned; it also had the perfect amount of fat to give it flavor, but not so much that it was more gristle than meat.  The side we ordered was interesting (which is why we ordered it!), and tasted exactly how it looked.  I thought it would be a tad bit sweeter with the molasses, but it was a subtle/mild flavor, and complemented the steak quite nicely.  I enjoyed all the flavors of the dessert (almond cr√®me, a brownie-like cake, topped with a small scoop of ice cream), though the cake was a bit drier than I prefer.  \\n\\nValue - My steak and the side were priced perfectly.  As mentioned above, the portion size of the hanger steak was a bit smaller than we'dve liked, if it were 2 oz more, it would have been spot on.  The dessert was a little pricey for the size, but it had several different elements, so I can see why.\\n\\nService - The service was stellar, from the moment we walked in till when we left.  We went for an early meal, and ended up being the only ones in the Bogie room the entire time, so effectively had a waitress all to ourselves.  She was very attentive, and topped off our drinks regularly.  The waitress was always polite and professional, exactly what I look for.\\n\\nOverall - The service was the icing on the cake of this meal.  Every course was delectable and perfectly prepared.

The \\"classic\\" Italian chicken soup tasted home-made and flavorful - the chicken chunks in it, and there are several, were definitely planted after soup's been made, as they tasted good enough to be on a dinner plate.  The tomato bisque had an interesting chunky texture, and might have been just a touch tart, but it had basil and other interesting things going on in it.\\n\\nThere were 5 different entree choices.  One of our choices was the chicken piccata, which comes with a side, which I decided to be the \\"sauteed spinach\\".  Upon opening the box, I thought I saw a large quantity of slivers of almonds in the spinach.  Upon closer examination I realized...OMG - the chef has committed genocide of the most gruesome kind.  He'd dug up (or sent henchmen to dig up) an entire NATION of garlic bulbs, peeled their skins off, and cut them all up - just to cook up a little itty-bit of pan-fried spinach.  Book a ticket to the Hague for HIM, as surely he is about to be tried for some kind of war crime.  No exaggeration: in the roughly one-and-a-half ounces of spinach that was in that box, we found what amounted to no fewer than what I estimate to be 4 or 5 dismembered garlic cloves.  It was pretty surreal!  The sad part is, that family of garlic died in vain, as they didn't really liven up the spinach all that much.  The chicken was OK, far too greasy, with no remarkable taste to offer any redemption for the extra cals - and this, after I'd requested in my order to \\"go light\\".  If they'd only just squeezed some lemon into the sauce instead of pouring in more oil!!\\n\\nThe \\"champagne\\" pasta was both better and worse.  The portion is smaller, and unlike the chicken piccata, you DON'T get to choose a side (not sure why, exactly).  The description of the meal was mouth-watering: \\"Pan-seared shrimp and scallops with jumbo lump crabmeat, mushrooms and roasted red peppers over tagliarini in our champagne cream sauce\\".  The shrimps and scallops are very small (they're bay scallops), but there WERE a lot of scallops, and the lump crab meat, too, bordered on bountiful.  But there were very few mushrooms and roasted peppers, and no sauce - NO SAUCE (i.e., not \\"too little sauce\\").  It was a cross between \\"bland\\" and \\"blah\\".\\n\\nYou can request bread with your meal.  If you do, you get a pretty hefty half loaf, and it comes with a little package of EVO oil (very good).  Dessert ratings will have to come later, as my liver is still issuing SOS all over my body to combat the invading fat cells that threaten to (once again) take over my body.

So now, to rescue this $22 investment/ripoff, I have to: go back out in the frozen conditions to my local grocery store to buy a couple bags of mozzarella, peel back the top of each slice, add the cheese, and microwave each slice.

We've always received expert service from all of the waitstaff, as they have each been highly in tune with the menu and wine list.   Here's my honest opinion though. The atmosphere is certainly a unique, as the restaurant is themed as an early 20th century Florida fishing shack. The filet is essentially on par with a Ruth Chris or a Morton's. It's buttery tender and not over flavored. I've tried the dry aged ribeye as well and again it's on par with the other uppercrust steak houses out there. The generous sides are as you would expect from a restaurant of this level....Very rich and very yummy, but we've seen this before even though it's wonderful. The 8oz filet is $49 a al carte. Here's where this restaurant truly stands out though. Their cheese cart is something like I've never seen in the U.S. before. Do yourself a favor and at least order the 3 cheese selection, or even the six cheese selection, and the server will bring the cart to your table. At that point the server will essentially educate you on, and walk you through each cheese choice, and it is formidable. My wife and I have fallen in love with the cheese cart as there are so many wonderful pairings with wine etc. (Try the Purple Haze or Humboldt Fog). We will stay at the Gaylord Palms just for the cheese cart and wine to start the evening. After wine and cheese we will go to another restaurant nearby.

Honestly, we were not prepared to eat dinner that early in the day, but what were we left to do.  There was a table that sat down about 15 minutes after us, they too explained they were there for the brunch.  Another table must have saw what was happening because on my way out, another guest stopped me asking if we thought they were serving Brunch.  I checked their website and there was no mention on it that there was a special Easter Menu, and when I called to make a reservation asking if they were taking reservations for Brunch, they should have probably said something.  Just a heads up to management, Brunch on Easter Sunday is very popular and in the future you might want to let your patrons know when calling if you are not planning on serving Brunch, especially at 11:45 on a Sunday.

All barbeque is different.. It is the differences that  make trying different places exciting. Old Hickory House is the archetypal Atlanta Barbeque. This is the South. Pork is the thing. The meat is pit cooked and has a great smoky infusion. The smoke ring on the meat is usually visible if you have any outside meat. The guys cooking the meat have been doing it for decades. The tenderness is excellent and the meat is always moist. Now add the best sweet barbeque sauce you will ever taste. It is oniony and has a little vinegar for kick. The pepper is present but not overwhelming. Finally, the portions and price are excellent. The Brunswick Stew is made the way they have done it for years. When you eat their stew you are taking a trip into Atlanta's past. The insider's order is this. Sliced pork plate, outside, stew and a salad, coleslaw or fries. Sweet tea or Coke.

For sides we got hush puppies and arugula (my husband is a cheesmonger and cheese writer and he was \\"lured\\" by the mention of grana padano), and loved them.\\n\\nFor desert, we had an amazing almond doughnut cherry ice cream, fresh cherry compote, even though we had no business stuffing any more food in our faces at that point. \\n\\nMy friend Susie always says, \\"Don't skimp on the cocktails!\\" when it comes to writing reviews, so I will also add that my dude deeply enjoyed his pear shrub and I had two (or was it three) \\"commissioners\\" -- high west double rye, talisker 10yr, combier peche de vigne, black walnut bitters.

The place is great. 4/5 stars\\n\\nDecor/Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is great, its just a place that you want to be.  I forget which nights, but they have Spanish guitarist that come play and even when nothing is going on the lively atmosphere and rustic decor bring the place to life. 5/5\\n\\nPrice: 5/5 This is the most amazing part of Tasca.  IT'S CHEAP!  Also, I won't say why, but when they give you those cards to give them your e-mail address for newsletters/discounts.  DO IT! They have amazing deals that they e-mail you weekly.

These are elements me and my fianc√© tend to love about trying a new restaurant. However, this was straight up one of the worst food related experiences we have ever had.\\n\\nFirst of all, we waited almost an hour and a half to receive our food which, honestly, this is the lowest issue on my list. If the food is good, I don't mind having a longer conversation with my wonderful other half but at the end of that wait there had better be some damn good food... Spoiler... There wasn't.\\n\\nWe started out with two espresso's and a London Fog. The London Fog was pretty good, I've never had one before and found it pleasing. However, they served the London Fog in a chipped cup which carries all kinds of bacteria when the seal of the cup is broken. So, thanks for the bacterial infection with my breakfast. Then they set down the \\"espresso's\\" as you can see by quotes, I was displeased to say the least. I'm a coffee snob but even someone who doesn't give a rats a** what coffee tastes like would have spit that drudge out. It was watery, grainy, and burnt. EW. Just EW.\\n\\nI ordered the full English breakfast which wasn't bad but I also got a side of their beans and toast. I don't know if the beans had gone bad (which I didn't think was a thing) but whatever was wrong with the food it tasted like week old fish. I sh*t you not, absolutely the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten. I've been to London, had this particular combination and absolutely loved it, this was the opposite of that. I literally gagged and I'm not someone who gets grossed out easily. In fact, I've only ever given one bad review of an establishment that's how bad this was. But I digress.\\n\\nDo not eat here.

I'd like to note that when we were done with our salads, our entrees didn't arrive until probably at minimum 10-15 minutes after everyone had already finished.  (Didn't they want us out of there? Bring us our food! We're hungry.)  I also had to flag someone down to refill my beverage.  I completely understand that our server was busy, however it seems that a finer restaurant would have staffed to accommodate these basic needs for a large party, especially at 6p on a Saturday night.  When they did bring out the entrees, madness ensued as the servers tried to figure out who ordered what.  As a former food server myself, I don't understand why there isn't an existing protocol in place to determine food placement at a table; this is standard in the restaurants that I've worked at.  Several people came up completely missing their entrees.  Our server assured us that they were being \\"plated\\" and she would check on them.  Appx 5-7 minutes later (hmm...\\"plated\\" or did she mean \\"cooked\\"?) she returned with two more entrees.  As she was leaving, we had to alert her to the fact that a third person in our party never received her entr√©e.  The server went back in and returned with a chicken dish, which did not belong to our table.  The person had to tell our server what she ordered (third time's a charm) and we had to wait for that to be cooked (I mean \\"plated\\") as well.

They do have a few varieties of local produce (lettuce, tomatoes, blueberries, shiitake mushrooms) but for the most part it's just better quality supermarket produce. Certainly better than Foodie's down the block, which is nice for people in the neighborhood like me. I like the combo of being able to get what I need but also being able to get some local things too.\\nI asked when I visited today, and they plan on being open through the beginning of October, to coincide with the Open Market.\\nCash only!!\\n\\nETA: ok, since i originally wrote this, the prices have gone up a bit. i don't know if that's due to the bad weather this summer making all veggies a little more expensive, or if they're just raising it now that they've gotten more popular, but it's kind of annoying. :("},{"name":"Milk Street Cafe","address":"50 Milk St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The Sushi & Salad is great.

Berkshire pork is a high quality breed of pork and you can tell from that first bite.  While the ribs may not be as good as what I had in St. Louis, the ribs are juicy, meaty, and tender.

I liked the original sauce a lot, with a few drops of the spicy one mixed in.  When I first tried the habanero one, I didn't believe it was that spicy but damn it killed my taste buds for over 10 minutes.\\n\\nSides is probably the weakest part of Sweet Cheeks.  Didn't care much for the potato salad and mac n' cheese, but BBQ beans and carrot salad were good.  Carrot salad is probably my favorite.  \\n\\nNo free biscuits so we had to order it.  Kinda sucks for a BBQ spot, but damn these biscuits are amazing.  For $10, you get a bucket of biscuit with their honey butter.  The honey butter is crack.\\n\\nBBQ is probably forever ruined for me after Bogart's and Pappy's in St. Louis, but I gotta say, I do like Sweet Cheeks!

After visiting a few other tea salons in the last few weeks, we came in with some high expectations. \\n\\nFirst of all, by having a name like \\"the roof\\", you would imagine that it was actually a \\"rooftop\\". That would be wrong, as it is just a large room on the 15th floor. The view is alright, just really close to office buildings. We had a nice spot by the window though, and nobody else was really dining around us - even though the restaurant is huge.\\n\\nThe set costs $49, and you only get one tea. The finger foods are like any other tea salon we have been to, nothing special or outstanding from the rest. \\n\\nThe Roof was newly opened, as I thought it was undergoing some major renovations... although after seeing the space, I realized that it was quite dated still. Especially the bathrooms. It was like we were in a time warp. I am all about the \\"antique\\" french style, but this was straight '70's or '80's for sure... Not too inviting, especially when you're paying unbelievable prices for the high tea. \\n\\nDefinitely will not be going back.

I loved going to Tasca with a few of my friends for a nice and quiet dinner on a Friday evening. We had reservations for six o'clock and because the B line moves at a snail pace, I was unfortunately twenty minutes late. When I got there, the servers were warm and friendly and didn't glare at me for being late. Instead they smiled, welcomed me, and told me and my friend that we could go ahead and sit down at a booth while we wait for the rest of our party. It was raining and so the night was starting off kind of slowly. My friend that was waiting for me at the bar was uncertain about which red wine she wanted and so they allowed her to sample four different ones on the house. Based on the yelp reviews, I got the sangria and was quite satisfied by it. \\n\\nOnce we sat down, the servers came over with complimentary bread and olives. They did a fabulous job of keeping an eye on our drinks and asking us when we had an empty glass if we wanted another drink. Since our friend ended up being over an hour late, we ended being there from 6:30 to 10:00. The servers were always friendly and allowed us to slowly order throughout the evening. In order of what I liked, we got the following plates: \\n1) Filet mignon \\n2) Beef and pork meatballs \\n3) Israeli couscous \\n4) Fried cube potatoes \\n5) Chicken croquettes \\n\\nFor tapas, the portions were huge. I felt the menu offered a good variety and can satisfy almost everyone's needs. I'm so glad I came here and will definitely come back here again.

And wouldn't it be amazing if the food was delicious and affordable? It could be my neighborhood hangout....a place to walk to when I want to enjoy a glass of wine or two or maybe an entire bottle!!!\\n\\nOf course being that it is situated in a neighborhood just a few steps from a daycare, there  were many complaints from the neighboring homeowners who strongly opposed the opening of such a place just steps from where their children are sleeping. BOO HOO HOO. Seriously? It's not like this place is a bar serving up drinks until 2AM. Fast forward to current day - this joint is constantly filled with the complainers who just a few months back almost went on strike to prevent this cute cafe from opening its doors.....and their KIDS. Yes, you heard me.....there are always babies and young children here. Such hypocrites! They've now become frequent diners here! Ugh, annoying.\\n\\nAnyway, the place is very simple in decor - nothing fancy about it at all. it is EXTREMELY loud here...too many hard surfaces and nothing to help absorb the sound. They should definitely consider adding some acoustic sound panels / paperforms to help reduce the noise level. Nice patio outside that is pooch friendly which is a definite plus!\\n\\nOk, to the best part - FOOD! I was HEARTBROKEN when my husband told me that they no longer had the Oxtail Stew. This was the main reason I wanted to come here for lunch! Apparently the menu changes - I hope they bring this back because I'm a whore for Oxtail....best freaking meat there is! I had to settle for the Pickled beets & pear salad and a cup of tomato soup. Both were delicious. A little small in portion size especially for the price but definitely tasty.\\n\\nNow eater beware, the menu is very small here as are the portions but the prices are high. Especially for counter service. So expect quality over quantity. \\n\\nHubby had the Shaved Lamb sandwich which he said was delicious but left him hungry since it was so small.

Not once have I gotten a booth in the years that I've been going and finding a seat at all is frequently a creative art.\\n\\nI could be upset about the food. Contrary to a lot of other folks, I don't like Diesel's sandwiches at all. The Lox-Smith, the Pulley, the Little Piston 2.0, the Press, the Brie Melt, and the egg and cheese have all been disappointing thus far. They are all a bit expensive and simply not very delicious. Additionally, Diesel has a strong tendency towards running out of key ingredients for their sandwiches. I'm not sure I understand how you can run out of bread... or tomatoes... or cheeses... on a regular basis.\\n\\nI could be absolutely irate about the pay-for-the-internet situation. Are you serious???\\n\\nBut when I think and reflect on what I actually want out of a cafe, Diesel solidly delivers. When I show up to Diesel,  I want a stimulating place to dig into a book, research, or some other activity that I couldn't accomplish sitting at home. I'm not usually looking to pig out on random sandwiches or use the internet; I just want something to drink while I run my eyes across endless black and white print. To this end, their drinks are phenomenal! The tuck's turtle and raspberry lime rickey are exceptional as are the rest of their coffee drinks. \\n\\nWhen I need to be distracted, Diesel  offers some of the best people watching outside of a public beach. Trendy undergrads, brooding scholars, the beautifully androgynous, and other assorted Somervillians all hang out in peace.

They have Asian and American (or European as I think the menu says) style sandwiches, plus croissants, pastries and tons of flavors of bubble tea.  The bread is fresh, crusty on the outside, soft of the inside.  They stuff it with meat and veggies and off you go.  I heard another reviewer say they think the meat is skimpy, but I think the serving of meat and veggies is perfect.  At places like Jimmy John's I end up feeding some of  the meat to my dog because they put too much on, yuck.  Plus, Jimmy John's sandwiches are around $8.  Here you can get a sandwich for $3-5!!  If you like bubble tea, they have lots of flavors.  I don't do dairy, so Kelly gave me the option of soy, coconut or almond milk instead.

The rice was Jasmine and was nice and fluffy.  The main attraction here for me is the fried squid.  It was a very generous portion with a tad too much salt.  It could have also used some black pepper.  The taste was fantastic.  They put sliced jalapenos and lettuce on the plate which makes for an interesting flavor combination.

However, apparently Rice Bowl hasn't gotten the message, because being a complete jerk to a customer isn't necessarily the best way to earn repeat visits - especially when customers make an effort to post a negative review 30 minutes after their order was delivered.  In fact, I didn't even eat but three bites of it because 1. it was gross, and 2. not even remotely worth the extra 30 minutes of cardio that their MSG-laden food would require.  ...Although with the mood they put me in, I could probably do some serious damage in a kickboxing class right about now.\\n\\nI placed an order online and while it was delivered rather quickly, I was amazed at how rude their delivery person was he arrived.  When buzzing my apartment, he didn't do it once, but at least five times - each for an amount of time long enough to imply that he was annoyed and trying to get my attention.  I buzzed the door for him to get through so I could meet him downstairs, but he just kept buzzing - over and over and over.  When I buzzed, he'd buzz back, and longer.  Wondering what the heck was going on, I called down on the loudspeaker and he doesn't ask, but YELLS, for me to \\"come downstairs!\\"  And when I got there, he was literally standing at the end of the sidewalk - probably a good 50 feet from my front door - hurled the food at me, mumbled a thank you, and walked off.  The best part is that when I checked my phone a couple of minutes ago (which has been unknowingly on silent), I had four missed calls from them.\\n\\nYou know, I'm not someone to make delivery people wait, I always go down and meet them, and I tip well.  I understand being in a hurry, but there is such thing as treating customers politely, and this was really unwarranted.  As soon as I heard the door, I went to meet him - it's not like he was standing down there for ten minutes.  He wasn't even down there for two!\\n\\nReally, just skip this place.

So many choices of where to go to spend your hard earned 'bling' for that perfect bowl of ramen delight. Right along Denman, going toward Georgia Street, this little restaurant never gets the line-ups that the other place (Kintaro) does. I am glad that is, as for me, this place gives me the perfect noodle and soup fix, regardless of what kind of day it is.\\n\\nYou walk into a place that tries to give the look of a little Japanese hangout. There is a centerpiece table, that sits probably about 8 people, maybe a little more, and you have many small wooden tables that sit 2 people. Even the stools you sit on, have that old wooden look, with that look of a two-step stool. This place has a somewhat zen feel, with the bamboo plants in the middle, and the dark decor.\\n\\nYou are presented a very simplistic menu, consisting of just one sheet, with a front and back, with no more than a handful of items, most of them are just different variations of ramen. The one thing that stands ahead of all else is the broth that is used, as the flavour when entering your mouth is just amazing. Too hard to describe with words, but one must say that this is authentic ramen broth without even knowing. When the bowls of ramen hit the wood of the table, they are garnished with one big piece of seaweed, bean sprouts, a nice half of a free range soft boiled egg, some small pieces of chopped green onion, and a glimpse of some ramen above the surface of that tasty broth. Presented on a tray, with a nice big ladle, and a set of chopsticks for you to operate on this bowl of ramen.\\n\\nThe first thing that usually happens, is you take the ladle, and take the first sip of the broth, before you do anything else, to enjoy the flavour. The next thing you might do is search for some ramen, and to taste the freshness of each strand of noodle. The delicate dough taste of each bite, mixed with the broth is a joy on itself, especially if you are really hungry. You also find within the soup, strands of bamboo shoots and bean sprouts to mix with each bite or sip.\\n\\nI have never been disappointed coming to this place, as it is always what I want and expect. It does not provide wide chairs, and hallways, but what I want is a simple meal, that taste great, and this is what 'Motomachi' does, makes things simple, with only a few selections to never allow my mind to think, maybe I should order this and that.

Back in my day (and by \\"day\\" I mean like three years ago), this was THE time that bars/lounges/clubs started to get packed. But, this was not quite the case... \\n\\nFirst of all, the place was kinda hard to find. I'm no rocket scientist, but I ain't no dummy either. You have to walk up a set of stairs, take a right, walk down a really long, narrow hallway, and there is a set of non-descript doors that lead to the Emerald Lounge. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait long to get in (the place was dead for a Saturday night), and we didn't have to pay a cover charge (that always gets one extra star from me), but if there WAS a line, we would have had to wait in a hotel hallway. Um, can you say \\"awkward??\\" Well, at least the floor was carpeted.\\n\\nThe inside was not emerald at all. In fact, I think the only green I saw was the exit signs (yes, I looked). The lounge is very wide and has a patio on one end. There was a \\"private event\\" going on on the patio, so even though it was a gorgeous night out, we couldn't go on the patio (had to dock a star for that).

The beer garden is a great spot, with a retractable roof to provide you shade on a warm day.  Service was good & accommodating, restaurant was clean & had a BBQ joint \\"feel\\", so I'll go over everything we got on both trips:\\n\\nBiscuits:  A must, even if you just get one or a whole basket.  Biscuits are often disappointing to me, because they should be so good but often fall short at restaurants, but this place KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK.   Amazing biscuits - warm, fluffy, fresh, and the cinnamon butter/flavored jam combo they give you is the icing on the cake.  If you only get one thing, get the biscuits.\\n\\nTrays: Delicious and filling.  I had the pulled pork, which was juicy and flavorful.  \\nHot Scoops: Both times I got the mac and cheese, both times it was great.  Hot, delicious, with a nice bread crumble on top that gives a positive texture to the side. \\n\\nCold Scoops: I tried the cole slaw, its light and flavorful and definitely a good complement to the pulled pork.\\n\\nSandwich: Brisket sandwich was flavorful, cooked well and super filling.  \\n\\nAlso, they have an option for \\"just one rib\\" - I got it and was so happy I did!  Tender & juicy, and just enough to get a good taste.\\n\\nDrink selection: A plus, as they have a good amount of draft beers, bottled beers and cocktail drinks.  \\n\\nHighly recommend Sweet Cheeks!!"},{"name":"Victor's Italian Cuisine","address":"1639 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3","text":"Went to an event at Victor's Italian Cuisine today.

The saving grace is the comedy itself.  The comedians have always been funny.  \\n\\nWhat isn't funny is the lack of organization with the delivery of the event.  PRO TIP: There is always a huge line spiraling all the way up to the third floor.  No one ever tells people that if you have a ticket you can skip the \\"no ticket line\\" and head straight on upstairs.  This only makes sense to shorten the line.  Also why bother making people who don't have tickets buy them in a small walkway at the top of the stairs... seems dangerous, slow and unnecessary.  Why not utilize the empty space on the second floor bar to the left of the entrance.  Just post a sign or tell the bouncer to instruct people. Easy Peasy.  The smoother it is to get inside the more time people have to spend on food and booze.\\n\\nSpeaking of food an booze.  If you are attending, expect to order before the show starts and get the food/drink 1.5 hours later just before the show ends.  Also expect to be disturbed many many times by the servers who have NO IDEA where they took the order from.  From my seat I could see peoples food orders piled up in the corner waiting to be served since no one had a clue as to where it was going.\\n\\nPRO TIP: If you are hosting a reoccurring event with reoccurring seating arrangements, label your tables.  The servers have no clue where they ordered from.  I watched every single server disturbing people trying to ask who they got orders from, not even close to the right table.  All you need is to label the ends of the tables with ANYTHING.  A letter, a picture, a word, a color etc etc.  Even minimal labeling will speed up the food/drink delivery process.  This means more money in your pocket and more booze in my stomach.  \\n\\nBecause of that cluster @#$% I dealt with, myself and my friends only bought 3 drinks between 3 people.  Instead of 3 drinks each (9 ttl).  Because of a lack of common sense you lost out on six drink purchases and most likely my future business. \\n\\nBest of luck."},{"name":"Felipe's Taqueria","address":"83 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"A solidly middle-of-the-road establishment but it has late hours.

VERY GOOD!  She got chicken with lemon sauce and I got basic chicken parm with the homemade fusilli for an up charge. I'm not just a chicken parm girl, but I do like to order it the first time I go to an Italian restaurant because it's a good standard dish that is most easily comparable to other places. I was disappointed. The chicken was thin, dry and tough. Sauce was good, as was the  homemade pasta. Mom LOVED her chicken with lemon sauce.\\n\\nSince my mom and I were split on how our meals were, we went back the next week when she was in town again to give them another shot. We each got our own Caesar salads this time (yum), and also tried calamari, which looked good at another table the week prior. It was the worst calamari I've ever had in New England, possibly anywhere. It didn't look like what we had remembered seeing last week...it was very rubbery, and the breading thick and just bad..really bad.. We literally each took two bites and sent it back, so disappointed. Our waitress was very understanding took it off our bill without us even requesting it. She apologized profusely. I'm wondering if they were out of whatever they usually use and this was their back up? Would've been better off to just say they're out, if that was the case. \\n\\nAnyway, entrees: This time I ordered the chicken and eggplant parm. The chicken was just as disappointing as last week, and the eggplant was really soggy, spongy, lacked flavor, and just weird. Mom loved hers again.\\n\\nAlthough Im all set with this place, especially with all the new options opening up in Lynnfield, mom will probably drag me back for her chicken/lemon sauce. Its safe to say that I won't be getting either of my dishes again. I'd probably just get a Caesar, and look out for calamari at other tables. \\n\\nBottom line: Nice, comfortable, fun atmosphere.

We wanted to try something special and Yakuza had peaked our curiosity as the menu looked interesting and the ambiance sleek. For me going to a fancy place has to do with more than just great food, I also want to feel like a scenester because the place is just that cool. This place fits the bill in spades. We loved, loved, loved every dish they brought us and my Mom could not get enough of the different Martinis (actually a little frightening). I can't remember the names plates we tried, but I can tell you my mouth just waters thinking about them. Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong. I can't wait until I can go back and dine in the outdoor garden this summer. As has been mentioned in some of the other reviews the plates come out at a leisurely pace, but we were there for the experience and the company and the reality is this food is fine art. Well worth the wait.

I'm surprised that a ramen place didn't open up in Kendall earlier. \\n\\nThe business side of the restaurant is just genius. The ingredients you need for hot pot vs. ramen overlap, so you don't have a lot of food waste there. You're catering to people who want a quick bar meal (ramen + booze), and you're catering to people who want a more sit down celebration (hot pot + booze). Oh did I mention they have great cocktails and a high margin? This place is a win win.\\n\\nThe only downside is that it's kind of in the awkward space of Kendall Square to East Cambridge. It may be a bit of a walk in the winter, but it's definitely worth it. If you have a car, finding a parking spot is really easy.\\n\\nPRO TIP: go with the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen and add watercress."},{"name":"Dharma Kitchen","address":"3667 Broadway West","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Most people at my table were not happy.

The food was somewhat similar to Backspace but definitely had its own style and flare.  \\n\\nI really liked the fresh mozzarella, and the salad I ordered.  The bread was also extremely good and I kept eating it as the food was taking awhile.  My order was a special pasta and it was pretty tasty even though I was overstuffed from the apps.\\n\\nWe did have a small issue with the bill and charges for the drinks but it was cleared up simply and quickly.

It was the noon hour and there was only one woman working the front of the house.  She was hurried and stressed. She kept apologizing to the 3-4 tables telling them she would be right over... when a customer said to her politely \\"they should hire more staff for the lunch rush\\" she stated \\"no, I don't need anyone else, I don't like working with anyone, they just get in my way\\" .  Then she said it's when people order expresso drinks, it takes time.  I had just ordered an iced mocha and she told me she had to take care of ringing up 4 tables before she could get to it...

I no longer live there so it's a treat whenever I return. I should probably get something other than the chips and guac and shrimp tacos, as that is all I can recommend. What can I say, I'm a creature of habit! But they are so amazing. The tacos are super super garlicky, so if you don't enjoy garlic, stay away. I love them for this very reason. Plus, they have a great low-cal, natural margarita that always hits the spot. Not to menion, the crowd here is young, but not too college-aged, which is such a nice reprieve in a college town.

A few minutes later, one of the waitresses walked up to us in front of the restaurant and started complaining that we \\"stressed their kitchen at a late hour\\" and only tipped 10%.. Based on many other reviews here, this place isn't know for their great service; we experienced no different.. Given the fact that we weren't inclined to tip past the bare minimum 15%, we slightly miscalculated our tip due to their 5% H&W Fee because we all paid cash..
