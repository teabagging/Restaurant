This will just be my cheat snack over the next few days and share it with friends. Yeah right! I murdered the bag within 24 hours by myself. Smh. It is very good and addictive. The fact that I love popcorn already and now you cover it in even more deliciousness spells trouble to me. The sea salt can be a bit much after awhile. It is a bit too salty. I was constantly wiping my hands together or dusting salt away. Other than that, I would go back to this place. They are quite aware that Garrett's Popcorn is in Lenox Mall as the competition. I have not made it there but have had that brand on numerous occasions. It is good to have a local brand exclusive to Atlanta as well. That peach flavor for the month of July is awful though.

I would highly recommend the seafood pasta with the oil and garlic sauce! The dish was delicious and came with a lot of seafood, definitely worth your money! One issue I had with this place was that the service wasn't great, therefore we gave a 15% tip. Once the waiter received the tip, she came back to our table and told us that we had to give an 18% tip. This is very rude and unprofessional.

I liked their live out of the tank fresh tasting fish, though the soup and everything in the dish, including the pickled vegetables tasted super sour which wasn't a surprised because it was sauerkraut and was also very spicy. My face was sweating when I was eating this fish dish. The fish tasted exactly like fresh out of the tank tilapia which was okay because who doesn't like fresh fish? I'm not a tilapia person, but fresh live fish makes a big difference in taste even for low end fish like tilapia. I had the wide starch noodles which I don't recommend because it was very difficult to take out from the bowl with a soup or skimmer spoons. The noodles would just slide out of the spoons and there were barely any noodles! Just look at the photos!This was my first time having fish cooked with their method with pickled vegetables. They pickled their vegetables right inside the restaurant in large brown clay containers which were displayed near the entrance. The pickled veggies were super sour and spicy. The restaurant was clean, but the service was lacking. I had to walk to the supplies counter to get some more water and tea.

They tell you exactly what farm they come from, and the blueberries are so plentiful that they just have a big tray of them you scoop up yourself into a paper bag. BANANA CAKE: this is what they're known for. Try it once. It's good. So rich. OTHER COOL STUFF: I like the fresh baked bread for $5. Definitely worth the price. The hot bar can be hot or miss.

The first time I came here it was at an odd time like 3 and it wasn't as good as this time when I came at around 1ish.  I felt that being this was my second time there, I knew I couldn't eat a whole plate by myself. For 3 people, we had ordered the family style meal and a friend and I shared the combination of 3 meat plate lunch. The family style was 16.95 during lunch too and not the regularly 19.95.   We still had a whole box of leftovers.  My absolute favorite is the brisket. It was so tender and cooked to a flavorful perfection. Hands down the best brisket i've ever had! Oh and ask for the burnt ends or at least try some. You won't be disappointed. The sausage was good and so were the ribs.  It comes with bread and you can always ask for more.  And it also comes with all the other sides too. The potato salad is pretty good.  I made a sandwich with the sausage and brisket.  Oh and you should definitely add more BBQ sauce.

It is one of the most popular foods in America. But as there are many pizza joints across Atlanta, this one definitely stood out among the rest. Hearing about this place and how it is owned by an Italian family who moved here a few years back from Naples, I knew it couldn't get any better. We arrived at Antico's at 3:24 pm on Monday, September 06, 2010:From the outside, this restaurant looks like a mere corner restaurant. An Italian flag hangs from the roof and the outer walls looked a bit old, but not beaten down. But once you walk in, expect the unexpected.You walk in and two women are busy at the counter filling out orders. They are not quite Italian so this was a surprise after what I had heard about this place. People are waiting for their pizzas to be ready in the lobby of the place and cannoli's are being made by hand at the counter . Once the lady was finished on the phone, I stepped up to place my order. The friend I was with ordered a Margharita pizza. The classic. I am not one to finish off a whole pizza by myself, but I knew leftovers would be a plus for another meal. So two different pizzas it is.I went ahead and order the Margharita as well but without the cheese on it. The cashier kind of looked at me as if I were crazy and politely told me she had no way of ringing it up as no cheese. I told her I was a vegan, and all things changed. She was incredibly polite and told me that she could ring it up as a Margharita but that I should run to the back, tell the chef not to put cheese on that order number, and everything would be good.So I walked into the back and that is where the whole experience began to just get better and better. You walk back to where the tables are and you suddenly feel like you are in an Italian kitchen. A few men are tossing dough while others are chopping artichoke. Music with Italian lyrics is playing from a small radio as an eight year old Italian boy is helping to set the tables for customers. Amazing!I told the chef whom they had called Luca about the no cheese ordeal. Though he kept a serious expression, he was very polite about it. So my friend and I took a seat at what looked to be a park bench in the kitchen and watched them cook. Tossing the dough. Placing the ingredients carefully on the crust. Putting it into a 1000 degree oven. The whole show was worth the $20 pizzas (yeah. I know. Pretty expensive stuff).Once the pizza came out, I was amazed. It was just how I ordered it and had a delicate char on the crust that was to die for. I had only decided to eat maybe two slices but after tasting that first amazing slice, only two ended up remaining. It was that good! I must say, this is probably the most authentic pizza I have ever had and I will definitely be back for more from Atlanta's hidden away little shop. So whether you may be in the mood for a whole new experience or if you just want some delicious pizza done right, I would definitely recommend this place.-Andrew \\"VegMuffinMan\\" Morrison-For more, check out  http://healthfreax.wordpress.com/2010/09/07/402/"},{"name":"WINGS Granville","address":"1162 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"2 friends were visiting from out of town, and after checking out the pride parade festivities, we wandered away from the core of Davie St, and ended up at Wings to unwind.  It was Pride day, but there were 2 free booths, and seats at the bar & center table.  So it was 3:45pm, 75% full, and not hectic.  Majority of people are at the core of Davie, so this was a \\"good\\" amount of busy, without a lineup out the door.While the waitress was clearing a patio table for us, she said she would come back with menus (... as she took away the ones that were already on the table, I'm not sure why..).  After 15 minutes: no waitress, no menu - I found the original waitress, and said we're still waiting on menus.  She comes over moments later, asking us what we want to order. I said we still needed menus...She finally brings them over, and we ordered drinks right away.  And after that, she asks us what we'd like to order, even though we'd only had the menu for 30 seconds!  That kind of set the premise for the rest of the meal.. Through the rest of the service, we were faced with some of the shoddiest service I've EVER had, and I was truly embarrassed to have brought out-of-town visitors to this place.  - waited 30 minutes until we could order food.  Kept asking a waitress, who would relay that message to our own waitress - who would never come- we had 2 waitresses for some reason (maybe 1 got busy and the 2nd was helping?).  But the issue was no communication. After waiting 10 mins for drinks, #2 came over to ask what we wanted to order.  We told her we already ordered... another 5 minutes pass, and she comes back to clarify that we had in fact ordered drinks.  It was a lot of \\"I'll tell your waitress..\\" which is fine, but when we're kept waiting all the time, its obvious that there's lack of communication.  By this time, we've been waiting 15 minutes for our drinks.- a waitress went to the tables on either side of us, asking them how their food was and if they needed anything else.  While we've asked if we could order several times already- plates were randomly set down in front of us without clarifying which dish belonged to whom. Generally not a big deal if an honest mixup happened but there was clearly no effort- 2 plates of wings arrived, but the girl didn't tell us which flavor was on which plate.  We asked her which was which, and she said, \\"I don't know. Well what did you order? I really don't know\\" then someone else came over and told us :S- my friend wanted mayo for her 3 mini slider burgers, and the girl said it was $1.50.. FOR MAYONNAISE.  I've never heard of a full service restaurant charging for a basic condiment.  $1.50 is ridiculous!!!  Fritz's Fry House has a variety of 20 dips for $1, Cactus Club / Milestones offers their amazing watercress dip for $1.50.  No way were we paying that for plain no-name mayonnaise.  I won't be surprised if they will also charge for ketchup, and salt / pepper.  By this point, you really couldn't even have given it to us \\"on the house\\" considering we already spent 30 minutes waiting to order? - asked for 3 forks & napkins / wet naps, and got 1 fork, no napkins. Had to ask again- we were never rude to the waitresses, and never complained / told them off, but of course frustrated since we had to ask countless times for service.  Since it was obvious that we had been getting pretty piss-poor service, they didn't bother trying to rectify anything, or ask us how our food was, or if we wanted to order more drinks!  Maybe they figured since we were already upset with the service, that they weren't gonna put in the effort to make it better- I was shortchanged by 15 cents.  I was supposed to get xx.90 back, and I only got xx.75.  Its only 15 cents, I can survive without it.  But come on, its the principal.  You give your customer the EXACT change, even if its just a penny.  This was just sloppy and it felt like they were taking a piss out of us.  I couldn't find a waitress to bring up the issue (not a surprise..) so we just left. I don't like leaving a restaurant without tipping, and it rarely happens, but I really felt this wasn't worthy of any tip, not even the 15 cents that they held back. - the food? really not that good.  All the food was pretty dry / overcooked, and the wings were really dry / chewy.  Not all the wings were dry, but most were.Sloppy service served with a side of embarrassment for me.  No thanks, never again.  Other reviews (ie: Nathan W) seemed to reflect my service, with the incompetent and unprofessional servers, they really don't care about the customer at all.

Any more than that and you'll wait till your stomach eats itself), and were seated by the \\"bar.\\" Which was nice, it felt like we were at a chef's table. Our waiter pointed out his favorites - which we immediately decided on: Chicken and Shrimp Pesto Ziti and Salmon Lobster Sauce Linguine, and we ordered some calamari and a bottle of wine (such a reasonable price!). The calamari was fresh and the marinara had just the right amount of zing to it. The pasta, omigawd the pasta, it was filling and warm (the heat kept rising off of it - even after 10 minutes - they bring it out so fast!) and as satiating as your favorite dish by the Italian grandmother that you wish you had. The sauce on my linguine was creamy and tasty and it warmed me from head to toe. The salmon was perfected with sauce and fell apart in my mouth. Unlike many Italian restaurants, the pasta at Giacomo's doesn't feel heavy upon consumption. It leaves you feeling happily, yet not uncomfortably full. The staff was great. They're like the Italian family that you wish you married into, and your new in-laws are always trying to feed you traditional, amazing Italian dishes while bustling about endlessly (yo, any of you bus boys single? Kidding, obviously).

It is a solid go to spot to start a night, or chill out and have a few drinks and small bites. The food is not ground breaking, but is always consistent. I am always down for charcuterie and Barcelona does a very good job at it. I always get the drunken goat, Macao (love the rosemary), Jamon Serrano, and Jamon Mangallca. The only thing I can say about this is that I wish they would get duck breast prosciutto since we can't eat pork - the DC location had it as well!For the rest of the tapas? Honestly, you can't go wrong with ANY of them! We do have a couple favorites though - Patatas Bravas are ALWAYS a must at any Spanish tapas place, but Barcelona puts a little creamy spin on their's that is to die for (suggestion: save your plate to dip your bread in there!), spiced beef empanadas, squid ink fideos, HANGER STEAK (that truffle sauce? Oh my word), Grilled Pulpo, albondigas, chorizo and fig, honey whipped cheese, anchovies, duck egg migas, and the swordfish. Remember that these are small plates so if you're going with one or two other people, you may still even be hungry after ordering all of that! As for drinks - I'm a huge fan of the Guns n Roses - it's a little spin on an orangey rose, and I also get a pitcher of white sangria whenever I'm with friends. Last time we went here, we got the wine flight - you get 3 half glasses.Also for other tips - TRY THEIR BRUNCH! They have a full on bloody marry and mimosa bar - Wish they would do a bottomless option, however last time when we expressed this opinion to the manager, he gave us a bottle of champagne for a good deal. For the bloody mary bar sometimes they have cured meats and anchovies, but most of the time it's your classic pickled veggies, carrots, celery, etc. For the mimosas, they have other juices and syrups like raspberry and pomegranate! They also have bitters - so much stuff to spice up your drink! I do wish their bloody mary price would go down though, it's $12(?) for a shot of titos.

The good, the pie was loaded with steak, the bad, no gravy or anything to make the inside moist and juicy, so it seemed a little dry.  The pie crust was nothing to write home about, probably because it lacked that gravy (why I always get the Ale) to soak up.  I did break fine and get a piece of shortbread pie, I guess that's the Ugly!  It was really flavorful and I'd come back for that.Another customer said the fish & chips are excellent, so I'll try that too, if I can eat inside out of the 90+ heat!

With the bill, they give you a little survey that if you fill out, you get a chit that is good for either a drink or a brunch tapa. 10/10 will go back."},{"name":"Omni Austin Hotel at Southpark","address":"4140 Governors Row","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"ACL fest always gets me excited for Austin!The not exciting part? the hotel prices. Finding the Omni on Expedia for $215 a night seems like a bargain compared to a lot of the downtown, SoCo, East Austin hotels which were easily going for $300-$450 a night. Gone are those days when I would splurge on hotels Just. Like. That. Love the amenities that come with this Omni -- especially the pool area. October in Austin still assures me 90 degree weather and a refreshing dip in the pool is a great way to wake you up! Or you can use their gym to work off that BBQ :) Our room was standard size and had a comfy bed. We were given a room facing the freeway on the second floor near the admin office. It was quiet enough since this is a business hotel, but we occasionally heard toilets being flushed from upstairs and the airconditioning would make a loud hiss here and there. Overall, the room was clean but is desperate need of update and brighter lighting. Do not miss the crab cakes and a stiff gin based elderflower martini at the hotel bar. Besides, you'll be hard pressed for food options around the area.

The layout is interesting, and the bar takes up most of the space but it still looks nice. We were seated against the window at a small manicure like table. This was kind of weird bc you don't have room for your hookah, drinks and food. The drinks were a not strong at all. Mostly juice. I ordered the salmon and my friend ordered the chicken. Our food took 45 min and it wasn't even that busy. Oh and don't ask for a cup of water bc you can only buy bottled. Plus our server forgot to get me water and didn't remember until I was done with my food. Now let me say, that the professional picture of the salmon and orzo shown is NOT what I got on my plate. Didn't look like it at all. The salmon was fishy, bland and very underwhelming with flavor. It tasted like they literally just pour maple syrup and mustard on top. Honestly it tasted worse that something I would make a home. The orzo was nothing but cooked cold noodles with a pinch of salt. My friend's roasted chicken was a little better in flavor but he could tell what part of the chicken was used so he was worried. I had high hopes for this place but the food and slow service really turned me off from ever wanting to go there again. I'd probably just got for a drink but not the food.

The first was to meet Lauren S for a lovely, casual lunch.  Since I had the coupon, I went all out - spider roll, hamachi nigiri, and pad prik pork.  After all, it had been at least 10 months since I'd had sushi.  (It probably would have been safe for me to have spider rolls while expecting, since all the ingredients are cooked, but considering Atlanta is landlocked, even the fresh stuff isn't that fresh...).  Everything was tasty, but I'm glad that I was only paying half price, since nothing was particularly memorable.  The hamachi was decent consistency for Atlanta, the spider roll was crispy and just what I expected.  The pad prik pork wasn't at all spicy, but the hot (temperature), thick sauce was comforting on a cold December afternoon.The second time was to get take out during the intermission of our viewing of Gone With the Wind.  The Scoutmob coupon didn't apply for take out, but I was looking through my Scoutmob coupons when we were discussing our lunch options.  It was the easiest take out within walking distance.  I got the pad prik pork again, and noticed that the sauce is definitely heavy in a sticky, syrupy way, and again no spice, despite having peppers by the name on the menu.   You must have to request that it made extra spicy.I'll go back when I'm in the neighborhood, but I don't think it's worth a special trip, especially considering the plethora of middle of the road Thai in Atlanta.#Yelp365 - 12/365"},{"name":"Ben & Jerry's","address":"20 Park Plz, Ste 14","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is the Best Ben and Jerry's I've been to.

We had to rearrange the table and stools just be be able to walk and pile in the area. When the waitress finally came around, she took our orders and left. We got our food randomly about 40 minutes later, and maybe saw the waiter 2 times. Once was to ASK for silverware, which they ran out of so were were given plastic fork sets.. we overlooked it because our food was getting cold waiting.Additionally, we saw the waitress once more because most of the table ordered bottomless mimosas, which did not end up being bottomless because the 7 people who drank them were only given two carafes the entire three hours we were there. When we finally saw her again, we were then told that they were out of orange juice. We asked to speak to the \\"manager\\" and when she eventually came around she told us that there was nothing they could do because they were out of orange juice and the \\"brunch is over anyway, so I don't know what you want me to do\\".... she also told us that the waiter lied on us, saying she had given us 4 refills. A complete lie and waste of money. The manager was rude and not accommodating at all, even with the birthday girl.

Decided to come to try this location outside of normal dinner hours (3pm) and ran into a few other groups from the prior night at the other location. Looks like we all had the same idea and as a result, we did not have to wait to be seated.  Ordered the classic Pok Pok wings and while it only comes with 6 wings, it's the smaller drumstick, wing portion, and the actual wing tip joint. Essentially, it's 12 standard wings. While a little saltier, it was tasty although it smells pungent. We also tried their spicy tomatoes small dish which was tasty as well! The tomatoes were soaked in a salty sauce and topped with chills but they weren't too spicy. It was perfect! Also, drink their water!!!!!! They soak pandan leaves for 24+ hours which leaves a nutty, coconut, tropical taste. Best tasting water I've ever had."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"This was one of my stops during a BBQ tour in Austin! So I rented a car and drove to Salt Lick for a late lunch, arrived around 1:30pm and there was a slight waiting list....but wait, I was traveling alone and if you are alone -- you get to \\"skip\\" the line and get seated much quicker! Score!I thought that I would end up sharing a table, but no, I got a table all to myself. So as a solo traveler, I opted for the Thurman's Choice at $16.95, which includes Briskets, Pork Ribs, and Sausage with side of cold slaw and pickles. Wow, I was so full and eating this massive plate of meat almost made me a vegetarian... I said almost...Here's the deal:\\nBriskets, Good - but definitely had better in Austin. Not sure if I was already too full as I ate this last thinking that I was saving the best for last, but I thought it was a bit too chewy and lacked flavor.\\nPork Ribs - Finger Licking good. Super Tender and meat came right off.\\nSausage - The HIGHLIGHT. These guys literally popped in your mouth. In comparison to the other BBQ stops, this place had it the best! They do have their own house sauces (you can also buy bottles), but I recommend eating the meat without the sauces first. I believe that great BBQ is great just as is!This place reminds me of a camp ground, where they have two dining hall buildings with an additional outdoor area. BYOB and boy do people bring their own coolers full of drinks. Must do! TIPS:\\n- They have a winery, check out their winery and have some wine!\\n- If you don't want to wait, ORDER TAKEOUT and sit by the children's area where there are tables and benches! \\n- BYOB, as I said. \\n- Parking is limited even though they have a massive lot. I recommend coming during OFF PEAK hours, especially if you are a tourist and flexible with time.\\n- Great place for GROUPS. Large bench seating!\\n- BRING YOUR KIDS and PARENTS!While I do love this place, the briskets didn't make my cut and hence the 4 stars."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Rude abusive old Italian man that has no respect for humans.

It's just too tiny...The pizzas are big enough to feed two people:- The Salty Pig: True to its name, it actually is a little salty. It is still really good, though. Very nice, meaty pizza. That said, it tastes like a meaty pizza I might make for myself at Blaze Pizza... so at $15 it really is quite pricey.- Anatra: Duck confit pizza with goat cheese and figs. It is really good, and also a unique pizza you wouldn't be able to find at every pizza shop. I do recommend this one if you like duck! It's very rich and has an interesting flavor profile.

I've actually eaten there 3 times since then and feel I can give a object review. First time I ordered the dinner combo of broccoli and chicken with fried rice and wonton soup. The portion was generous and the flavor of the broccoli and chicken was good. The the extra .50 I paid for the fried rice was not worth it. It literally was 1 ice-cream scoop of rice. The plate needed more rice and the flavor of the fried rice was bland. The egg roll look more like a fried spring roll wasn't very flavorful. I would pass on the egg roll and the fried rice. (I forgot to take a picture). The soup was good, a little salty, but manageable. My second time there I ordered the Happy Family option... which was a combo of chicken, beef and shrimp with mix veggies in a delicious broth. This time I didn't not order the fried rice and the combo was not an option. Just got the white rice. But again, I feel the amount of rice given compared to the protein is off. It was just 2 scoops of ice. I enjoyed the meal and the broth made the meal. I asked for the meal to be made extra spicy. It really wasn't spicy at all. My third time there I ordered the lunch portion on the weekend. I ordered the Thai Basil chicken extra spicy, white rice, pork egg and wonton soup. Since it was the weekend and I just wanted to eat one meal, I ordered an appetizer of the fried chicken wings. Honestly... not sure they do fried items well. The chicken wings were nothing special and were basic frozen chickens wings fried and they were salty to me. The sweet chili sauce that came with it didn't to help. Just not worth it to me.The main reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars... I did carry out with all my order. After driving home with my third meal I discovered all my broth from my Thai basil meal tilted and was swimming at the bottom of the bag. Not sure why they decided to serve meals with a good amount of broth in regular styrofoam containers that are not sealed tight. I literally had to carefully get everything upstairs and pour the broth from the plastic bag and back in to the food container. Overall it's a good new spot. Love that I can buy a complete meal and not have to buy family style (Ho-Ho).

Anyone that says the food/drinks here are fantastic are really just captivated by the decor and location of this place...or they have tastebuds that are off, who knows. That's not to say the stuff here isn't GOOD, it's just that it's heavily overpriced and presentation over quality seems to be their key to success. I've been here thrice and well, I don't know if I'll be voluntarily going anymore.I've already forgotten what I got the first two times, but on my most recent visit I ordered their pumpkin shake. $8 for a \\"large\\" cup (think grande in starbucks terms). Of course, what I expected wa ssomething more of a \\"venti\\" but nope, this was their large. Now I don't know what it is about their sizes but it seemed like their small cup was just a thinner yet slightly taller version of their large, though not by that much. I wish I asked what the oz were for each size because it was bugging me the entire day.Anyways, I ordered it on a whim, and on the receipt it said something like \\"shake of the week\\" or whatever. I didn't see the pricing because it wasn't listed anywhere.The shake itself was a few scoops of vanilla ice cream and a pumpkin spice pie thrown inside. Ok well, think about it. Vanilla ice cream doesn't have that much of a sweetness to it as other ice creams do; it's a neutral ice cream that can go well with almost anything. Now throw in a pie with a 50-50 crust to insides ratio. That crust tastes like what? Nothing. The sweetness comes straight from the insides of the pie. Throw that alltogether into a shake and you get.....blandness.An extremely thick and bland shake. Now I will say the pumpkin flavor WAS THERE, but the amount of pumpkin flavor in the shake did not qualify the shake to be called a pumpkin spice shake. If I had any say in what goes on in the menu, I'd say ditch the pie and replace it with a syrup or better yet, trash this garbage item.Of course there are a plethora of other drinks you can consume here, so I can't really say much for those. I'm no coffee connosseiur, but I did have their coffee here once or twice. Look at the other reviews for their take on the coffee.Their fruit tarts are rather basic too and their cannoli pales in comparison to other cannoli's I've had, primarily in the filling. On the flip side, GREAT study spot with a GREAT location.

I was excited to finally bite into my Crab Rangoon as I love them in general. THIS WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST CRAB RANGOON I EVER HAD. I really don't think it can get worst then that. It seemed old, spoiled, sour, tangy, just so gross. I didn't get to enjoy this meal and just threw the whole thing out. I will never go here again. They went down hill all the way. They have a restaurant on the other side but, no one really goes to this restaurant anymore. They had two drunk men at the bar who couldn't walk straight and probably drove home. They now have a lottery machine I believe and they sell scratch tickets. So they definitely know how to get money in their restaurants but, they need to start thinking about their customers again. My parents use to get Chinese food from here a while ago and back then it was okay, It was never great. But, now I wouldn't recommend eating here to my worst enemy. They have a fish tank that been there for years and there's no fish inside of it. The tank is also dirty. If they don't take care of little details like that what made me think they will take care of the little details when preparing my food?Next time I am going to just spend the money and get the other Asian food in the area that goes for $20 and up for dinner.

We were the first customers to arrive. Checked in with the host, 2 more families walk in and by 5:30 they seat the people who arrived after us first. Not sure why. But with only 1 host seating people we had to wait till she was done with the other 2 families.When we finally sat down. Our server brought us some warm damp hand cloths. Which I thought was nice. Something for guests to wipe their hands with. The overall ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful as was the decor. Everything seemed very elegant and clean.We ordered 2 sushi rolls, the lobster roll ($20) and the king shrimp roll ($12). We asked for the shrimp roll deep fried. Personally I liked the shrimp roll better than the lobster. We also ordered 1 piece of Wagyu nigiri ($11), and the chicken Yakitori skewers ($6). The skewers were were pretty good, but nothing special. The wagyu didn't impress me. I actually spit it back into my napkin. For dessert we ordered the green tea creme br√ªl√©e ($10), which was absolutely delicious, best part of the entire meal, however for the small portion I don't think it was worth $10.Overall the place was just okay. The staff was nice enough, the food was decent but nothing special, especially for the prices. It's not that I WOULDN'T eat here again, but I can go somewhere else for food of similar taste and quality that costs less. I was also a little surprised because my partner and I both hated the wagyu nigiri yet our server still charged us the full $11 for it, even though I told her it was so bad I couldn't swallow it. No discount or anything. I didn't say anything because I know I shouldn't except her to compensate for food we just don't like.... but most restaurants would. That part didn't affect my rating, just thought it might be worth mentioning. Make sure you order what you know you'll like rather than trying something new.3/5 stars for for nice ambience, good dessert, kind staff, but extremely average food, and not worth the prices."},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"WOW! I highly recommend this place if you're looking to impress business partners, out-of-towners or to celebrate a special occasion.PARKING: There is self-parking as soon as you enter the parking lot, towards the right side. However, these spots are often taken during peak hours. As you proceed towards the restaurant, there is complimentary valet service. AMBIANCE: up-scale, modern, dim-lighting, live big band music. There are large open windows facing the chatoochee river, making the sight utterly beautiful! There is also outside patio seating facing the chatochee river. This place is super romantic and the view just adds more romance factor! FOOD: they are known for their fresh seafood. In fact, I was told by my server that their fish is flown in each day, so it's very fresh. We got the hot appetizer platter which was a hit! I also ordered the lobster platter for my main which includes scallops, shrimp, salmon on a bed of rice. The lobster was so succulent! Scallops cooked perfectly. Oh and it all came with a side of butter for dipping. We ordered all of the sides. Mac and cheese was ok, the sweet potato had a strong white wine taste. Not too impressed with their sides. ATTIRE: dressy. I was there for dinner and most patrons were dressed nicely in dress shirts. SERVICE: Great! Our server was very attentive, refilled our drinks frequently. No complaints. OVERALL: A+. I would definitely come back for their fresh seafood, upscale dining and romantic scenery.

The reviews were enough to convince us to try it out.First off, what is it with all of these random Atlanta restaurants insisting on valet parking at all times of the day?  We took advantage of the early-bird specials menu by arriving right when Nakato opened at 5:30pm.  Although the lot was empty and it was broad daylight, we had two valets rush out to greet us.  Since we were in 2 cars, I'm immediately thinking, \\"Great, I don't have any cash on me and that's at least $8 in cash that I'm now on the hook for that I wasn't expecting.\\"Besides the unexpected and very unnecessary valet service, the dining experience was very similar to every other Japanese teppanyaki experience I've ever had.  Right down to the giant oil fire to get things started, the spatula karate acrobatics, the shrimp tossing and flaming onion choo-choo-train trick.  The one interesting twist was that everybody was served noodles in addition to the standard soup, salad and fried rice.  This was a nice add that most places don't offer.  The food quality of the meats we ordered (shrimp, steak and chicken) was decent enough, but not super high quality.  The service was friendly and attentive and the chef was humorous and accomodating.  Nothing about this place set a new standard in the Japanese steakhouse experience for us, but it didn't fail us, either.  We received what we expected, other than the valets.  What was cool is that our server allowed us to overtip her on the credit card and then she gave us cash back to help tip the completely unnecessary valets.On a side note, the private party rooms looked very cool, with the traditonal Japanese seating (legless chairs on a padded floor around the low teppanyaki table)."},{"name":"Falafel King","address":"48 Winter St, Ste 1","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazing.

On the one hand you have your Au Bon Pain (see other reviews, hence the reason to skip) and then a Dunkin Donuts and then some unknown Metro Cafe. Then of course there is Flour. Having frequented the South End location I thought I would give this location a shot. What a mistake. The first thing you realize when you walk in the place is that it is set up wrong and crammed into a very small space. You may look around and want to grab a seat, but good luck since there is a small area dedicated to seating and with the over flow of the Children's Museum, it is brutal. The other part you may quickly realize is that the counter area is forced up against a corner of the back of the place and has a case and then counter, laid out with baked goods and then a small area for a cashier. There is no indication of where to put an order in and there is a mess of staff tripping over each other to try and assist the next customer. The floor of the place is cement and you begin to feel like you are in someones old basement. The small case of baked goods and the counter/glass area of baked goods looks appealing, but there is no real way to see what is behind the glass since there is a crown of people milling about not knowing where to place an order. The final thing you realize is that the staff is in la la land and look like they have no idea what they are doing. I don't think it is too difficult to pour a cup of coffee or put a croissant in a bag, but somehow they make this look like it takes 4 people to do it. The wait for an order is annoying due to this haphazard customer service and there is not reason behind it. The only good part is when you finally get your order, the food is pretty good and the baked goods are delicious.

Is the parking lot a strange time portal that took the woman back to a time before the restaurant opened?  Or has she entered the Twilight Zone?I really didn't know what to think when I drove up.  Errol arrived, and wondered if we should go elsewhere.  Turns out someone forgot to turn over the sign.I really didn't like how they renovated the interior.  It's very rustic looking, and completely open.  I think it looked better when it was Antonio's.  Nine televisions, all playing sports.  I wasn't aware this was a sports bar when I chose to eat here today, but the TVs and the complete lack of women in the place quickly tipped me off.  I was the only female patron in the place the entire hour-and-a-half we were there.  Errol got some sort of burger with beer-battered onion rings.  The burger was huge, and the rings were pretty good.  I ordered a club sammich with fries.  The fries were better than average, but the club wasn't clubby enough.YOU:  What do you mean \\"not clubby enough,\\" Catherine?Mainly that the bread wasn't toasted.

Wrong items or toppings and almost always, missing items that are on the receipt which I paid for.  Terrible attention to detail time and time again.  I would strongly recommend to eat at a different store.  Any restaurant!  Just not at the Bithlo Taco Bell.  It will save you time and an unpleasant experience.  The owners or owners group must be incompetent clowns for the consistent level of mistakes simply filling an order.  I mean you have a piece of paper and a computer monitor which details what each item is.  I understand mistakes happen, but systems should be established and maintained to eliminate and fix consistent errors  I would either extensively retrain the managers or fire them.

We hadn't seen them in a long time, so we figured a nice quiet place like Aquitaine would be great. We got there at 11am and decided to walk in and grab a table before our friends arrived. There are essentially two sections in the restaurant. The cramped area by the windows in the front where they apparently bullpen in the families with screaming kids, and the more spread out area towards the back with the booths and square tables. We looked around and saw that there were many booths open, but guess where the snotty hostess put us. Yep, right smack in the middle of kid town. I am not exaggerating when I say it felt like we were sitting at IHOP or McDonalds. I was 6 inches away from a child in a high chair who was screaming in my ear. My wife had a baby spit up on her while the parents just laughed and didn't even apologize. We looked at each other and right away knew what the other was thinking .... this place sucks.We asked the hostess if there were any other tables available and she said \\"no\\" without even looking us in the eye. A party of four women walked in right behind us and were immedicately seated in a booth. We politely asked if they had reservations and the hostess said no. We were shocked. What awful customer service. We gave the menus to the hostess and said how upset we were about our seating. She shrugged and continued to talk to one of the servers. That's when we asked to speak to a manager. Only then did we finally get her attention. This place is a joke. We didn't even get to try their food! We were hoping to have our friend's wedding shower here. I had planned on bringing some of my business colleagues over for lunch during the week. So much for that. This place failed miserably. Epic FAIL.On a side note .... we ended up going to Met Bar at Legacy Place. Wonderful experience. We were given the royal treatment with a friendly hostess and wait staff. The atmosphere was quiet and classy. Service was timely and efficient. And the food was phenomenal. Met Bar won us over BIG time. Complete polar opposite of Aquitaine.

I went thinking I would just try some BBQ skewers which was what was recommended. This was perfect since I went at 5pm and wasn't very hungry at all. But, when I realized it was a hotpot place I couldn't resist giving it a try.My dining companion and I were the only two in the restaurant so service was pretty prompt and decent enough. The menu took a while to figure out but once the server explained it, we ordered:-bbq lamb skewers \\n-bbq bun on a stick\\n-spicy and tomato yin-yang hotpot soup \\n-beef, noodles, and tofu (ordered a la carte rather than all you can eat)Overall, the food was totally passable. I would def come back. It seems like a fun place to come with a group and eat a late dinner. I just wasn't blown away as I was expecting.The tomato soup had a nice flavour - it's a little sour but was fairly mild. I didn't try the spicy one. Beef and tofu were standard- nothing special. We only ate a couple slices of the beef since we weren't too hungry. After the meal I did experience some stomach iffiness but that I'm fairly certain can be ascribed to the spices of the bbq lamb skewers. Nothing to be concerned about, but def be aware that the seasoning of all the food here is on the heavy side. Great flavours but definitely heavy on the spices.I think I would probably come back for the skewers but only eat hotpot if very hungry and/or with a group.

I will give them props, though, because they've accounted for this issue through an outdoor area where you can order from their food truck! The menu is limited and not the same as the inside. During our visit, we were able to try multiple dishes in a family-style way. We had the Squash BBQ, Snacks for the Table, Ceviche, Bread, Ribs, and all the desserts. There was a tie for the best thing we had - the bread or the Squash BBQ. The bread is made in-house and paired with a roasted garlic head and some delicious butter. The 5 pieces of bread cost $8, which is absurd, but I would buy it again. It was really great. The Squash BBQ is a main entree that is made to split between 2-3 people. The half squash is served with all their side dishes and is a pretty great value at $45. It happily fed 6 of us, so I'd get it again. The other things didn't wow me. The $17 snacks were tiny. They had mentioned there would be a swordfish dip on the board, but there wasn't. When we asked about it, they told us it was outdated, but found some in the back that they gave to our table.

My companion and I both got the pork three ways and were greeted by two plates of virtually raw meat with surrounded by large slabs of undercooked fat and a burnt side vegetable.  The management was gracious enough in offering a gift certificate in compensation, so two years later we decided to try again, this time zeroing in on the Craigie on Main burger.First off, as many people know, the not-on-the-menu burger is famous, and they run out quickly.  They run out quickly because they limit themselves to making only 18 per night.  Understandable, since ground beef is so hard to come by.  Why 18, however?   Is the owner an avid golfer?  Why not 20?  Or a nice prime number like 23 - see - prime beef - get it?My same companion and I again ordered the same thing each - two burgers.  We sat in the bar area tables that can be reserved, and my seat was literally right next to a fire extinguisher placed on the wall at seat height.  Comforting to have in case of an emergency - I could tend to things myself.  We were told that the cooking standard for their burgers is medium rare.  I agreed to that, and my companion ordered hers medium.If a hallmark of quality is consistency, then Craigie on Main passes that test.  As with two years ago, the meat was completely undercooked.  My \\"medium rare\\" burger was raw with a bit of char on the outside, and her \\"medium\\" burger was rare.  Meanwhile, as two years ago with the Brussels sprouts the french fries were about half-burnt, and the condiments were utterly bland.  Apparently, the equipment in the Craigie kitchen can only be set to burn for the vegetables, yet the same equipment seems unable to heat up the meat adequately.  At their prices I feel stoves that work could be purchased.It appears to me that to put the kitchen staff through all that time and effort not to cook dinner seems a waste.  I understand that Chef Maws limits his burgers so as not to swamp the rest of his menu and not to skimp on the quality of the beef.  It would help to actually cook the burger through, however.  You'd be surprised but beef really does taste better that way.  (It would also help to teach your bar staff how to pour a beer.  I ordered two - a Trillium and a Jack's Abby, two of the best craft brewers in the area - and each glass came to the table 30% foam.)I'm sorry but after a second visit the only conclusion possible is that Craigie on Main is simply too hip for its own good.  Look at their items, please.  Sweetbreads, octopus, bone marrow, miso cheesecake, tarragon ice cream?  Adventurous for the sake of being adventurous might have been OK back in the 1980s but it doesn't fly now.  Concept never trumps execution.  This is a pretentious restaurant with a pretentious menu, and given the expense hardly worth the bother.  There are a number of great restaurants in the metro Boston area.  This isn't one of them.

I have been going to this restaurant since it first opened and they started out as classy, Belgian restaurant, known for their creative high-end cocktails that cared about details. Food\\nWe had the Moules Frites Congolaise and the mussels were small and not of the best quality. Back in the day they sourced mussels from Salt Spring Island which were large and plumb, these were of inferior quality. The food was just okay and I expected more when you pay +$30 an entree. There is no longer any wow factor here and this is the challenge of every restaurant, how do you maintain quality, when so many of the original Chamber management have left and gone on to do other things.Ambience \\nWhen did Chambar turn into a Club? Their patio was blaring with DJ music and people dancing to cocktails on the patio.  This is really sad to see they are changing their business model to become more of a bar/hangout joint versus a serious foodie's restaurant. Its sad day for Vancouver foodies when Chambar no longer is a restaurant that takes food seriously and is more focused on selling $8 patio cocktails."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food was excellent and the price was what we expected, maybe a little less.

Happy to hang out on the porch. 60 minutes later they say they can seat us but need to split the group up between two tables, not close to each other, since their only eight top sat down 30 mins ago. Having been told just 10 minutes prior they were getting ready to move two tables together this was rather confusing. We explicitly told them earlier we couldn't split up given the number of kids with us. Really disappointing to see such poor communication from the staff. Ended up leaving after an hour of waiting. To the staff, next time, tell us the only table that can seat us just sat down and it could be a far longer than the initial estimate and don't lie to us about moving tables together."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Our family came here a few times already.

I much prefer Giacomo that a lobster roll in Boston.The main problem(?) is that they don't have too many tables inside and the line is easily around 1.5hrs long.   Unless you are really determine to eat there, waiting for 1-2 hrs seems excessive.

The restaurant may not impress you from the outside, but it's an Atlanta mainstay for a reason!When you pass by Little Bangkok, there's usually cars double-parked out front and people crowded into the very tiny waiting area. You have the option to either find a spot right in front of the restaurant or across the street at the body shop or fabric store-- just do NOT park in the gas station next door's spots! The outside is a little dingy, but the experience 100% makes up for it.Inside, there's very limited room if there happens to be a wait, but we've never had too much of an issue. The tables are small and close together, so I maybe wouldn't come here for a first date, but for some reason the atmosphere feels just right. The wait staff is quick, they serve a pretty standard variety of wine and beer (Kirin, Sapporo, etc), and the food is SO incredible. The menu is divided into half Thai dishes and half Chinese dishes. We usually get a starter and one entree from each side, and we always have leftovers to bring home. As far as specific dishes, here are my recommendations:\\n-Appetizers: Thai spring rolls, basil shrimp rolls, Thai dumplings\\n-Entrees: Panang curry, chicken pad Thai, moo goo gai pan The entrees are between $10-$15, so it's a great deal for Atlanta! We've never had anything but a great experience at Little Bangkok, so we'll continue to come here for dates and do take-out when we need a quick meal."},{"name":"The Old Mohawk","address":"821 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Bang for your buck: 7.5/10\\nQuality: 10/10\\nService: 10/10\\nAmbiance/Location: 9/10\\nOverall: 9/10This Classic Columbus joint must be tried!

The wait was relatively short- maybe about 15 minutes and there's plenty of people watching to entertain yourself while you wait. We were seated at a table for two that very closely abutted another table for two- so much that it almost felt like we dining with two others. It's pretty cramped in here. However, it was not overly loud, which was nice and we could easily converse. We ordered a bottle of wine and we each got the linguine with half a lobster, mussels and clams in the Giacomo's lobster sauce. So delicious and very reasonably priced at around $20 per plate. Note that they are cash only, so make sure to have cash on hand. The food was absolutely amazing- so fresh and delicious and served piping hot. My only complaint was that our server was kind of abrupt. He basically told me that no he wasn't giving me any more parmesan cheese on top of the pasta when I indicated I wanted more. He also threw down our water, wine and meals- nothing delicate about the placement of the glasses or dishes here. Moreover, when my companion got up to use the bathroom, both our server and another server tried to clear the plate away. Our server even argued with me about it. The food came out really quick though, so no complaints about the speed of the service. You do feel kind of rushed to eat and leave because there's a line of people waiting, but the food is really good quality and a great price. Very cool North End experience.

Thus distracting me from the horrendous wait time. As Dalton says, \\"Be nice until it's time to not be nice.\\" Well Austin's Pizza, you have made me choose the latter for this review.  Normally I don't order pizza during Road House. Hell, normally I don't even pause it for a bathroom break. I just grab some beers, put on some pleated slacks and the tightest black near-mock turtle neck I have on and hit play. But this day I was in a good mood. We were at my friend's apartment just after a brisk pool session. I was nursing a hangover, soaking up the cosmic rays, getting healed by mother nature. Beautiful babes surrounded me and I was sipping on a cold brewski. Everything was sweet, until a raging hunger befell us all. One of my compadres with an IQ that makes Albert Einstein look like Terry Funk, suggested pizza because they are a genius.So we figured we would take in a movie while we waited our delivery of Earth's most perfect food. Road House, the classic piece of 80's cinema starring none other than Swayze and Sam Elliott, was obviously the only option. Nearly the entirety of the Rowdy Herrington's magnum opus lapsed whilst waiting for these disc shaped pieces of garbage to enter our domicile. When the delivery person arrived 90 minutes later, they rushed to get us to sign the receipt and got out of there faster then Dalton could rip out Jimmy's throat. To add salt to the gaping throat wound, Austin's Pizza has done something I've never thought I would admit to. They delivered pizza that I hated. I NEVER thought I would dislike a slice of pizza. Normally when I am hungry enough to eat the ass end out of a stuffed polar bear, I will tolerate subpar pizza. Even if it's served from a place where they have to sweep up the eyeballs after closing. This was something on a level I've never experienced. The taste of this so called \\"pizza\\" could only be described as the equivalent of licking Wade Garrett's unshaven pubis after an epic brawl at the Double Deuce. We would have been better off eating the pizza box dipped in the ranch dipping sauce they supplied. Said ranch, which while inferior to most, was the most palatable \\"food\\" we received on that dreadful day.  Not to mention the aftermath. Later that day I had to attend one of my oldest friend's wedding. Once I told him of the atrocity this pizza was he was disgusted. His future wife broke down in tears, fainted, then fell down a flight of steps which tore her dress off exposing her undercarriage to all who attended. It ruined their special day. So thanks Austin's Pizza! You ruined everyone's day, my future of watching Road House more than once a day and possibly my friend's entire life."},{"name":"The Copper Rocket","address":"106 Lake Ave","city":"Maitland","stars":"4","text":"Great bar with really good food and good drink specials.

We had to make our way down to San Antonio, and my hubby decided we had to make a pit stop. Mind you, they are a little off the beaten path for sure, but we were dead set on visiting. I believe they have a couple different locations, but it's my understanding that this is the original, and much more \\"magical\\" than the others. Think of the other locations as more of a Rudy's or RibCrib, and this a real bonafide BBQ joint. The service here was really awesome. Everybody pretty much seems to love working here. They walk everybody through the history of the salt lick, as well as encouraging you to take plenty of photos. I think that's a great thing, and is probably a reason they have amassed some fame. It's really worth noting that when I went to go take my photos of the pit, the pit masters actually moved out of the way and asked me if I wanted to get even closer! That's some great service right there! Our waiter was great as well, answered any questions we might have had, and walked us through the menu. The sweet tea was very good, and I noticed they do BYOB as the table next to us had a case of bud light! If your more of a wine person, they actually have a on sight winery, the Salt Lick Cellar! Would have loved to stop in there as well but we got there as soon as they opened. The food was pretty good. We tried a little of all the meats and I think our favorites were the ham and sausage. The brisket was also very very good, and I like that they ask you what cut you prefer. The sauce on the table is very interesting, as it is a mustard base. We weren't too crazy about it, and it's something you don't really see in Texas, but it was pretty good. The sides were my least favorite part, but that's more of a personal preference. I was really hoping for some rib stickin macaroni, but the owners mother comes from Hawaii, so he puts a lot of her influence into the cooking! Overall, we really liked The Salt Lick, and is worth coming to just for the ambiance alone. This place is so beautiful, you could have a wedding inside!

My husband ordered the Fusilli Carbonara, and I got the Fusilli with Chicken and Broccoli in White Wine Garlic Sauce. They were both full of flavor, and hard to choose which one we preferred more. We even had some leftovers for lunch today, that heated up nicely. As others have said, the owner does \\"EVERYTHING\\", from taking the orders to cooking the meals, and all in a tiny work space.  He's clearly Italian, and knows how to prepare authentic dishes with ease. Despite us not asking for a side of garlic bread, we did notice that it was included in our bag, and that we were actually charged for it, but we didn't call to complain, because it only ran $2.50, and tasted great! It definitely complemented the pastas. Since the place is \\"a hole in the wall\\"(though not in a bad way)we will probably just do takeout again and again. We love having a neighborhood gem with tasty options at an affordable rate!  Here, you're not compromising quality for cost.

First off, there always seems to be an attitude with the employees when you place your order and if you make a mistake, they'll decide to of course to blame you and postpone your order for a ridiculousness amount of time like my friend. Second, the employee purposely swept garbage under neath our feet out of frustration. But what I found the best part was that, the employees leave garbage on there counters because there too lazy to setup a trash can. This is not the first time this has occurred, they literally DON'T CARE.

I ordered the \\"Black and White\\" cake which was described as \\"Rich dark chocolate cake with cream cheese icing.\\" My goodness. First of all, the cake was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. It was thick. The cake was so moist and still in good condition even after being 4 hours since I picked it up from the bakery. I personally am not a big fan of chocolate cake but this cake definitely hit the spot.

The way the place decorated reminds me of a garage with bold colors and classic rock.

Of course I tried the Chicago dog. It was good but the Vienna dog casing lacked the \\"snap\\" of some types. I'm not picky about this but I know some people are. I also tried the southern slaw dog (cole slaw, bread-n-butter pickles, onion strings, BBQ sauce, and jalapenos) which was really good too. I think I could have eaten 2 or 3 dogs plus fries!  They have a bloody mary dog (tomatoes, green olives, celery, horseradish-pepper sauce, and celery salt) and roasted garlic mashed potatoes dog (mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and potato sticks) that both sound interesting.I agree with the others that the fries are the star. Fresh cut and perfectly crispy and salty. Yum! Prices are a little steep. Meals with fries and a drink will set you back almost $7, while a dog alone is over $3. Too bad they aren't utilizing their drive thru window- that would be convenient! Overall a good experience. I can definitely see coming back here."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First off, AMAZING atmosphere!

Ordered tons of food! All were a decent portion to share with my other 3 friends. Spinach & chickpea casserole was amazinggg, as well all the other dishes we ordered: ham & cheese croquetas (can't ever go wrong with those), grilled hanger steak (cooked medium/well), Albondigas, chorizo, homemade chicken empandas, calamari, and topped it all off with a huge pan of paella at the end. My server forgot a couple orders (1 potato & 1 beef empanada) but graciously took off the other order of emapandas we had earlier. We were stuffed by the end of the night!

Seriously, it's really that good. I've been a season pass holder for a few years now and I don't really see that changing any time in the near future. The reason why is simple: they place is just a good solid time every time we go. Since we've been so many times (over a dozen separate trips now and counting) I have some helpful hints to hopefully make your experience a bit more enjoyable. First off, the basics. Wear sunscreen and a good pair of shoes. The properties are huge and you will be walking a lot!Depending on when you go you will have to deal with a lot of other people and therefore some lines for many attractions can be a beast. The best advice to do as much of the park as possible is the single rider line. You'll either go to a totally separate area of the ride (Spider-Man is like this) or you'll be in a separate line but still able to experience the immersive experience of the line system that they really do excel at in so many ways (Transformers). You'll be in line way less often and while you may not be able to go on the same ride vehicle as your family/friends every time it makes for a more fun experience overall if you ask me. At the Universal side of the park the main entrance can be a bit daunting because of the huge crowds, but if you have your ticket and you pay attention you can get through it quickly. The tip here is to BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE. You will thank me later.As far as rides go Universal has a few really good ones; Minion Mayhem is based on the Despicable Me franchise and it's a really fun motion simulator that does a great job of keeping you entertained while on the ride and in the queue (line). This ride has obscenely long lines consistently. If you want to get in there quickly (and who doesn't?) get in there early. The single rider line is rarely ever open for whatever reason too, and so I hardly ever go on the ride even though I'm a Minion nut. Transformers is AMAZING! Seriously, the movies suck but the ride is so much better. It's a motion simulator with an excellent queue that keeps you entertained and is very immersive. Single rider is a must here, but I'll tell you that it is one of the easiest rides to get in and on in the entire park. This is a must while you are at the park. The Rock-It is the roller coaster you see and it's such a blast. The ride itself is fast, exciting and really cool because you can listen to preset MP3 tracks from various genres. I highly recommend Kickstart My Heart by Motley Crue as that song kicks butt. The ride queue is hilarious because it's so cheesy. It's animation style looks like a Gorillaz video and the voice acting is so cheesy. Single rider is anther time saver here and the ride is such fun. If you are a Harry Potter fan I don't need to tell you about Diagon Alley and the Gringott's ride. Gringott's is just not that impressive for me because I've never been a Harry Potter fan and I really don't find the stories that compelling or interesting so the ride is just a fun motion simulator. I'll tell you though that this ride has broken down or had some mechanical issues in nearly every occasion I've come. Though my last experience was flawless and for the first time. One big issue is that for me I can hardly understand what the actors are saying, because the audio is so muffled by sound effects and music. There are a ton of other rides and attractions. Some are good (The Mummy and The Simpsons) and some aren't (Men In Black.) It's a good time and I love coming here."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The food here is great.

It was less than average for Texas barbecue and frankly the ribs were tough, the sausage had a weird flavor, the brisket was dry, and the barbecue sauce was not good. It has mayonnaise in it or something? The biggest issue I have with this restaurant is the price for the quantity of food. I got the Thurman's Favorite and it should have been double the amount of meat for $20. It was a half of a sausage, 2 slices of brisket, and 1 rib. On the plus side, the wait wasn't long and the service was good for a Monday at lunch time. I would have been mad had we had to wait then I wasn't happy with the food. I've lived in Texas my entire life and this is not great Texas barbecue. There are many places in this region with better options.

This place came up so decided to go give it a try. Right off the bat i knew this place can only serve standard sushi nothing too special that I have never seen before and that's ok because sometimes you just want normal stuff, and regular/good quality. The place was sort of small maybe approximately about 15 tables? So not alot of space.  The thing I do really like about this place that I haven't found at other places is their sashimi pieces are cut very thick and that's a very good thing! Usually some places are cheap on the sashimi and give u small and very thin slices, but not here! They actually give you a good large piece which I like very much. The sushi is alright, again nothing too special or exciting but that's what this place is about. Just plain standard items. Also their platters are pretty competitive in price as some places charge more but give you less, I find this place they give you alot for a decent price. What i remember seeing was a platter with sushi,maki's and sashimi for like 37-38 pieces for $20.00 that's not bad! Definitely a good place to come for a small group.

However, the waitress was really welcoming and told me that it was totally fine for us to sit so close to closing time. She sat me down and immediately serve me. I ordered the poll saltado and my boyfriend the lomo. We were both extremely impressed with the food. Very rich in taste and exactly what I would want my pollo saltado to taste like.

You can also street park along some of the neighborhoods.Restaurant looked busy with about 80% of the tables being full. Impressive for a Monday. Despite this, the hostess was able to seat us right away. Ambiance is definitely a diner so very casual. Not the typical brunch Sunday Funday vibes.Prices were cheap for Atlanta \\"brunch\\" prices at about $12 an entree.So what killed my experience was the dirty table we were sat down at and the almost 45 minute wait for our food. Around the 30 minute mark, our server came by and said something to the effect that the kitchen was \\"working on our ticket right now.\\" His tone made me feel like the kitchen had lost our ticket.Our food looked delicious. They do a good job on presentation. I ordered the Southern Benedict with over easy eggs. My eggs were not runny at all. The yolk was basically sunny side up although I had ask to change it. The biscuits were too dense for my taste. Gravy was OK. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food but we all agreed it wasn't necessarily worth the wait or the atmosphere.Overall, I can see this being a place you can take your family to try a Southern twist on breakfast if you don't mind the wait.

The last time I was here, I had some lamb dumplings that were a special. Yikes. They were awful. The dough was too thick and very chewy. The lamb filling consisted of a lump of meat the size of a peanut M&M. There was no flavor to either component. The dumplings came in a peanut milk and chili oil broth that was all the latter and none of the former. The Belgian fries, however, were fantastic. I could definitely order those every time.

When the girl was calling for him for about a minute and he was ignoring her for whatever reason joke or not it's a work environment even if you guys have a good relationship you take you job more seriously even if it's just McDonald's. You could tell she was embarrassed because we were waiting a while for him and saw and heard the whole thing. The reason why she was calling for him was because she didn't know how to scan the coupon from the app or enter the coupon code. The thing I didn't understand was why didn't he teach her how to do it while he rang us up that way in the future she didn't have to wait on him and embarrass herself yelling for him and she could take care of it. It really wasn't rocket science. Since all this happened the line was held up and I'm sure the people behind us was probably becoming pretty impatient and hangry ( Oxford 2015 word meaning hungry and angry ). So when the manager scanned out coupons he messed up and because he messed up he gave us a sandwich on the house which was cool but it's like how do you mess up a coupon scan. But to the food portion of the review. The presentation was a 2 looked like it was just thrown together really but it's McDonald's what can you expect but when did this become ok. I'm sure any business would want their products to displayed in a good way I'm sure the founders would be highly upset at the garbage being sold and how it looked. But then again they are making money from it. Cheap food or not treat people food with some respect. People are paying for it and we are also eating it so be more considerate.

This time though I was armed with some gift cards given to me last Christmas and a childless night with The Wife (who had been here once).  It was time break the seal on this place for me.I liked the decor when I walked in, tall ceilings and wood beams and a nice smell in the air.  I checked in with the Hostess who said it would be 25 minutes so we headed for the bar and placed our drink orders.  The bartender then asked if we would like menus, she must have seen the puzzled look on our faces and clarified that if we wanted we could take a little booth and eat in the bar.  I went back and canceled our name on the list and took a seat with my lovely bride.I had planned to try the fried fish combo but as I opened the menu a small laminated card fell out advertising $15.99 all you can eat shrimp, you get teriyaki, beer battered, herb crusted and coconut shrimp, and after that you can order as much as you want of any of the four choices.  Heaven!  The Wife ordered a skewered shrimp dinner and we waited a short time for our salads and fresh sourdough bread to arrive.  Food followed soon after our salad plates were cleared away and we were elbow deep in crustacean goodness!  I was impressed with the menu, it was hard to choose just one thing from a varied menu of fried, baked and wood plank grilled fish and steak dishes.

We walked in on Thursday night for a couple drinks and were not surprised to see the bar and tables all packed.  The host whispered to us that the back bar was opening right then, and we walked past the crowd and sat down at an empty bar all to ourselves in the back.  Unsurprisingly, the back bar feels much like Pint House's back bar, large and U-shaped and a lot more spacious than the front bar.  Three different bartenders waited on us, and all were as friendly as could be, especially since (or perhaps because) we seemed by far like the oldest people in the place being in our mid thirties.  We didn't go on the covered patio because it was about to storm, but it looked super nice out there.The beer list was pretty good.  There was a fairly extensive draft selection with both local and out of market craft beers.  There were several bottled and canned beers, and they had some fun sounding cocktails.  As a craft beer drinker, I liked that a good beer cost the same as a Bud Light.  All the prices were pretty fair.  We didn't eat any food, but the menu sounded like pretty good bar food.  Hot chicken was the featured thing on the menu, and I'm a sucker for hot chicken.Honestly, my only knock on the place was how my beer was served.  Unless you're having a Milwaukee's Best or something, beer should not be served in a frosty mug.  It's a very strange experience to drink a saison in a frosty mug, and it impacts the taste of the beer.  Overall, though, this is a fun new bar that's worth a try.  I wouldn't want to be there on a crowded Friday or Saturday night, but it would be a great place for day drinks or for mid-week drinks."},{"name":"Church's Chicken","address":"5704 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Unbelievable.

Now that I jumped right into what I ate, lets talk about the ambience. It was dark but well lit if that makes any sense. In others words I could see. The place was very clean. I loved the location where I was seated. It overlooked the entire plaza, with nice shops nearby, such as Cami cakes, Francesca's Boutique and a nail salon to name a few. The waiter was very attentive and friendly. The prices were moderate. I think it's a nice place to have lunch. The menu didn't have a lot to choose from, but enough to be happy with something, I'd think. I love the Vinings area and will be back to SoHo.I forgot to add: The reason I decided to dine at this restaurant is that it had gluten free options. It was a bit deceiving because my daughter is highly allergic to gluten and saw on the menu she could have a gluten free chicken sandwich . When she ordered it, the waiter said she could have it, but the bread isn't gluten free. Ok, then it's not a sandwich what the bread. She looked so disappointed as she normally is when we dine out at most restaurants. Restaurants need to realize that there are people who like to dine out with food allergies. Before anyone thinks that allergy sensitive people should only eat from home. What about when you're traveling and can't eat at home? What about people who are working in conditions that aren't always feasible to carry a meal with you? Some places will state they have gluten free options but it has been crossed contaminated. Then it's not gluten free. This wasn't the case in this instance, but It's something to think about for all restaurants. Eating out with a food allergy has become more difficult than it should."},{"name":"Aquitaine","address":"500 Legacy Pl","city":"Dedham","stars":"3.5","text":"I am giving Aquitaine a very strong 4 stars.

Lunch deal\\n2 deluxe slices and a drink for $6.99 \\nAt first this seems like your standard lunch special but Modena kicks it up a notch. While most pizzerias give you 2 slices from an 18 inch pie, Modena's slices come from a 30 inch pie. No, that is not a typo. 1 slice from Modena is the equivalent of 2 slices from all the other joints near by. I cannot stress the size of these slices! Crust\\nSo with it being such a big slice, it's almost impossible to pass the \\"fold test\\". But guess what.... They did! I folded that huge slice and the tip bent ever so slightly. Open up the crust and you have great spongy air pockets. If I had one critique on the pizza, its that for me it was slightly under down. But I'm just being picky. Crust was basically perfect. Sauce\\nWhat makes the pizza in my opinion. Small hint on sweetness, they didn't drenched the pizza with it not did they hold back. Great balance all around. Cheese & toppings\\nCheese to sauce ratio was right on for me. Nothing worst than a pizza with too little cheese or the opposite so much cheese that you cannot taste anything else. Modeno's topping distribution was spot on. Overall\\nThis will likely become my go to spot for pizza during working hours. The pizza is excellent and you cannot beat that lunch special. I sincerely think I could split the lunch special with someone and still walk away full. I wish this place the best of luck. It's sort of located in a hidden location.

He said something about \\"beer and fried chicken on Tuesday's is cheap dawg. Like $5.\\" I know it's Wednesday, but still he really talked this place up. Not only once either. Everytime I talk about any chicken, he brings this place up. So, like the idiot chicken mouth-eatier/lover I am, I HAD to check this place out. Whistled my way there. This just happened like an hour ago by the way. It's still nice and sunny for mid-October Portland weather. Like, a really nice day. Did some partying yesterday and woke up around 3pm. Day wasted, but still time for a quick walk to this amazing chicken place. I still haven't showered, but still got time before the 'show' my friends are saying is going to blow my mind later tonight at LoveCraft. I got to the place and my first impression was, \\"ok\\". It was a bit strange. Looked like half trendy clothing store, half restaurant. The setup of the restaurant was odd as well. Look, I eat out more than the common person and mostly by myself. I enjoy my own time and own silence. One thing that really pisses me off is when the host/hostess assumes I'm there for the happy hour specials. They're not happy nor special. It's sad to be excited for any item which has cheaper quality, isn't that special at all and is less costly because of it. If it were that exciting of an item, it should be on the menu. Their best dish is never on it and it's a fixed price for top notch in all the restaurants I've been too. Also, don't suggest I sit at the bar. I don't like it. Hate stools. I like to plant my feet flat when I eat my food. So, NoGracias Se√±orit@!So, that all being said, they MAKE ME sit in the only available seat at the bar (of course there were tables, but were \\"Reserved\\"... I wouldn't reserve for this clothing/restaurant... LIARS), crammed between two strangers who could probably smell the yesterparty. I want to blow my nose and be a bit gross, but I have no table privacy for it. I can feel their elbows grind against mine. Hear the slurping from right guy and left lady is loud with her increble story about her \\"crazy\\" Wednesday. I've heard this one before. Something about Susan and Justin or Austin, idk. My head is pounding and the desire to leave increases when I get no service. How long have I been sitting here, 10min? 15? The menu was very hard to decipher and the layout was pretty bad. I feel like I've seen enough. If this review was solely on the menu, it'd be no stars, but it isn't. Ready to order. Ryan really talked this place up and really insisted that I have to try the chicken, so I wait more. Couldn't handle it any longer and start thinking about my go to restaurants. Fuck yes! Ramen. Marukin is about two blocks away! I'm outta here. Grabbed my jacket and whistled my way there. I'm Mr. Happy GoLucky FuckAll IV. Fuck this noise. Felt like a smelly bum and treated like one. Fuck you too. I just wanted a fucking table and some fried chicken before I even set foot in this place. I'm an easy customer to please, just don't be a judgemental prick. Don't judge a book by its cover, I'll tip you LADY!Anyways, back to the highlight of my experience on choosing to go to Revelry, I haven't been more excited for ramen in months. Marukin has the best ramen in a 2 mile radius. This is certain. You order when you walk up, sit where you want, they bring the food and later bus the table for you. The complete opposite experience to the one at Revelry. I tip very good here and more people should. I also fuck with Noraneko because it closes at 2am and sometimes it's too late for Marukin. I always get the same plate and it's always consistently great at both places. I would review them, but I don't want every bozo to come there and ruin it for me. They have room for a certain amount of so many too much. Today, they are a real party saver if you ask me. My expectations for tonight's show have been replinished. If I were to eat at Revelry and had and even worse experience, LoveCraft would be a no go. Anyways, like they say at the end of most poorly written essays, \\"in conclusion\\", I couldn't satisfy my wants to try that potential fire chicken Maloney insists on. Still want to try it as I write this sitting at my favorite, most delicious, ramen place. Maybe I'd order Revelry to go in the very instant future. Who can really never say? Most likely than not likely tbh really. 5 stars because Maloney is cool as fuck and a straight up mouth eating killer! Shout out to homie! Also, 5 stars because it's not your fault Revelry sucked in my opinion. I wish you guys the best of luck. Close out the clothing thing, it's fucking weird and an eye sore.

I feel for $20 i had plenty of lobster and if I could I would make a meal out of the brussel sprouts alone. Plenty of good beer choices on tap. Dancers and music was great. Since i was by myself, the bar had no wait and was roomy. Very attentive employees. They would see you needed a plate taken away or a drink refill, and since they would go past to the kitchen everyone asked if you needed something. When they served the food they came from the front of the bar. I felt if they were not your wait staff it didn't matter. They all took care to of you incase your waitstaff was busy.

It falls somewhere between a higher quality  Waffle House or Denny's, and maybe a lower quality Perkins.  The biscuits and gravy were probably my favorite. The biscuits were large and tasty, and the gravy was good with large chunks of sausage in it.  The hash browns were also damn tasty.  They tasted like they were cooked in copious amounts of butter and just lightly crisped on a flat grill, it was damn yummy.  The pancakes were also a big hit. They were fluffy and tasty. They were also sort of crispy around the edges, which reminds me of the pancakes my dad used to make when I was a little guy. They were the highlight of the meal , no doubt. On the down side, my scrambled eggs SUCKED. Seriously, how do you mess up scrambled eggs? They had ZERO flavor.  Also, the bacon is terrible.  I love slightly undercooked bacon (if it is too crispy I hate it), but this stuff was like a wet noodle. It was just plain gross.

The last two times my orders have been wildly incorrect. Not the items I ordered; I asked taquitos, received tacos. Asked for a side of rice, received french fries. The quality of the food has also tanked. One usually cooks an enchilada as an entire unit. What I was served was pretty much a taco, with canned enchilada sauce poured on top, topped with unmelted shredded cheddar.  My last two churros have also been stale- and they were ordered during the 6-7pm dinner rush. In other words, they shouldn't have been sitting out all day. Many of the items are way over priced for what they you actually receive, and service has always been slow. Unfortunately the extra wait is no longer worth it. It's also disappointing that the staff no longer seems interested in their customers, or bothering to provide the correct items.\\n  \\nIf you want anything other than taquitos (which are still good and reasonably priced), pay just a few extra dollars and get yourself some take-out from La Caretta.

I didn't try it, but the wonton soup was supposedly very tasty.Our main dishes, pad see ewe, ginger shrimp, rama forest chicken, and string beans with chicken, were a mixed bag.  The pad see ewe was standard - not bad, but not a standout.  The shrimp dish was fine, though the shrimp itself was a teensy bit chewy.  The string beans and chicken was very good, probably my favorite.

I have gone to this place a few times and I liked the place (for at least one of the items on their menu anyway) so I made it a habit of going there occasionally for a quick lunch. This place is owned by Korean people and so they communicate mostly in Korean. Since I don't really interact with the people who work there aside from ordering my meal and paying, they were not aware that I was Korean. So, I was already aware that the workers there used to talk about me - but up until this point, it was always about how much I seemed to enjoy sushi and quite frankly, I didn't feel the need to join in or interrupt their chat so I minded my own business and went on to eat my food whenever I caught them speak of me (happened on multiple occasions). However, about a week ago, I had a very different and quite a bitter tasting experience at the same place. Now, because I have been there enough times, I was aware of most faces - although there isn't many to begin with. There is this one Korean server there that have been there every time I went since the beginning. In the past, she had never been that friendly with me but I didn't really care because I just want to eat my meal and go on about my day. So, first, they know I always order the same thing. I order, and then I hear her saying rude (implied impoliteness/rudeness in the Korean language) comments about me and the item that I order! such as, \\"oh that one over there, she freaking eats so much sushi (very negative tone applied - as if that annoyed her)\\" and then goes on to complain about the order I put in - because I asked for extra sauce and ginger.... HAHAHA - a small, one of the countless sushi places in Vancouver and you wanna complain about the business you get? I mean please, you aren't Tojo's or Miku - from the way it seems, you COULD use some business. Also, I am saying this because I usually go to a nice restaurant but since it's a small, non-chain place I didn't mind, I thought it would be nice to bring them some business, you know? And, when I get my food, the extra ginger I ask for, was placed right on TOP of my food.... wow at this point, I was quite speechless. What kind of a place puts ginger on top of a customer's food?? - it should be placed on the side or on a separate dish. I am sure even at ghetto places would know this very basic common sense knowledge. And what is even more surprising ? - the manager/owner brought me my food. He saw the presentation of the dish and thought it looked ok or normal?? I don't even know what to conclude out of that. So, trying to let this slide, I asked for a separate dish to remove it myself as I no longer wanted their help. So then I get a side dish and after removing it, that Korean server comes with another dish with ginger. She is trying to communicate something with me but her English is quite poor so nothing really was communicated. So I let her know that the ginger came on top of my food when it initially arrived to let her know that I already have ginger. So then, she turns around and starts nagging and complaining to her coworkers about how I was complaining that the ginger was on top of my food! and that was when I decided I just can't let this go. So, I looked at her and one of the chef lets her know that I am looking at her - that perhaps I may need something. So when she came over, I told her that I speak Korean and have understood everything she and they have said about me and that I do not want the food. The moment I started to speak in Korean, she immediately started apologizing, which I neither accepted nor listened to - kinda late, don't you think?\\nNEVER GOING BACK THERE.I recommend you go if you don't speak Korean or you are friends with them. If not, take a Korean friend who can translate what they are saying.

The Bison Rib is definitely a lot tougher than the Beef Rib. Still a good flavor, but I think the Beef Rib was my favorite out of everything by far. Super tender and delicious flavor. Also their spicy sauce on the table is to die for! The potato salad, coleslaw and beans were nothing special.Brisket (1/2lb - $12.95): We couldn't come to another BBQ place and not try the Brisket. This Brisket is definitely a lot leaner than other BBQ places we tried in our Austin visit, but I think I heard some of my friends ask for fatty brisket, so that might've been an option I missed out on.

I believe the special actually came with steak or something but I specifically asked to make sure the dish would be vegetarian. My only complaint.. if the dish comes with meat, and I choose to skip on it, shouldn't there be more of everything else? Especially when it's ravioli! They were so delicious.. I definitely wanted more. If I hadn't had bread, soup and a piece of the app, I would have definitely still been hungry.

So much so that she plans on going on a pilgrimage of sorts when she visits us from Cali in the future. So when I told her The Salt Lick is within 45 minutes from our future home, she got even more excited.My wife and I looked at Driftwood on the map and plotted a course for it after we stopped off in Kyle. Located off FM 1826, the drive there was actually scenic, in a Texas back country sort of way, with rolling hills and plenty of oak trees along the way. The Texas Bluebonnets weren't quite in full bloom or the drive would've been even better.Upon arrival, we were a bit surprised to see how big the place was. Even the parking lot is expansive. We arrived around 11:45 AM on a Tuesday and the parking lot was about halfway full. I don't know if this was regular weekday crowd or if spring break had something to do with it.We checked in out front and there was no wait so we were led inside a cavernous space and were seated on a long table immediately. Since the place wasn't packed, we had our own table, though I think we would've had to share it if the place was packed.Upon being seated, we perused the menu and, since I read their briskets and sausages were the items people raved about, I ordered the brisket and sausage plate ($14.95) while my wife tried the pulled pork with cole slaw sandwich ($9.95). My plate came with beans (the magical fruit...the more you eat, the more you toot), potato salad and cole slaw. We were also served pull apart bread and additional pickles with our lunch. I also ordered sweet tea (hey, it's Texas) and the wife had soda to accompany her sandwich.My briskets were as advertised...tender, flavorful, smoky, and just plain yummy. The sausage was good but paled in comparison to the brisket's flavor. My wife liked her sandwich, commenting how tasty it was...although she would've preferred it to be accompanied by some chips or fries.My wife and I are not quite BBQ connoisseurs but we've lived in areas where BBQ is close to being a religion, in the south (Georgia/South Carolina) and in the Kansas City area...so we would like to think we've sampled some of the best BBQs in the country. I would say The Salt Lick BBQ deserves the hype...in both taste and ambience. This has become touristy, however, and may have lost some of its charm because of that.As future Texans, guess we'll have to try other famed BBQ joints in Austin and Lockhart!NOTE:\\nThis place takes CASH ONLY!

Long story short:- Had table reservation for 10 and they crammed us into a small booth.  We got \\"upgraded\\" to another booth that was still too small.  We had to keep asking for something larger until they merged 4 tables together.  Wow, that was so difficult!!- My first attempt at ordering one plate of wings and spicy crispy beans, the server gasped and told me I was the \\"one and only\\" person to have ever ordered these beans in 5 months...thus, the pub doesn't make them.  So why are they still on the menu???- I ordered MY food (2 plates of wings).  After a long wait, the server brings it to the table and FOR the table.  Hungry guys dig in and I have NO dinner.  Incredibly annoyed, mostly with the server.  If I order it, I expect it to be placed infront of me.  - The wings were of inferior quality.  Very small, several broken bones....very little meat.  Some were old and chewy like jerky, while others were either so fatty or undercooked that it was hard to tell the difference.  Bourbon maple tastes nothing of the sort.  And OVERPRICED!!- The server continuously brought the wrong beers to my friends which had to be sent back.- When I asked where the bathroom was, the server told me \\"We don't have one.  You must go outside and use one in the lobby of the hotel next door.\\"  Incredibly large space and no bathroom??  And a very short, rude response, as well.  After all this BS, suffice to say.... I LEFT THE PARTY EARLY!!  I could not enjoy my time there and the crap service.  I left very little money despite my bill.

When we arrived at nearly 9pm (they close at 10pm), there are empty tables all around.  The huge sushi counter had two people only.  They said it's a 10 min wait for a table, a 15 min wait for the sushi counter, or we can seat at the bar immediately.  Rolling our eyes and since it was late, we chose to seat at the bar.  The irritating thing is that no one else sat at the sushi counter for the rest of the night.  Do they serve only two people at a time at the sushi counter???  \\nThe deco is modern and dark.  Even the bathroom is dark, with blaring obnoxious Japanese lessons in the bathroom.  Oh, for f sake.  There's hardly anything Japanese in this whole place other than the food, why bother with Japanese lessons in the bathroom?? Minus 1.5 star for the salt, rice, and a bit on the price\\nI asked for an Omakase.  I was surprised to see two pieces show up for every plate, defeating the purpose of Omakase - to try lots of items per the chef's best pieces. It's lazy on their part!  As is the case for a good nigiri and especially for Omakase, it is delivered fully dressed, i.e. no more soy sauce.  Instead, they sprinkled salt on every piece.  It's weird!  I can taste the salt crystals so that the fish is a on the salty side while the rice is a on the bland side.  Bland sushi rice is an atrocity!  Great sushi rice sets a sushi restaurant apart as much as the fish does!!!

He wanted something from a different restaurant right around the corner, but I was craving their salad with smoked salmon. He came back and waited with me at the outside seating for 20 minutes as his food got cold and I waited for my salad (it's literally lettuce, salmon, fennel and dressing). When the food finally came out (mind you it's been almost 30 mins for the most basic $20 salad) my friend began eating. Within 30 seconds, a man runs out and informs me that no one who got food from a different restaurant can eat there. I informed him I was in fact eating food from Tartine and just wanted the company of my friend. He apologized without any sincerity and said it was policy because they have a problem with people from other restaurants that will sit there. I would usually understand, but the restaurant was empty, not a single person was sitting outside besides myself and my friend, and I had literally just spent $20 on a bowl of lettuce.

I could not take more than 3 bites because I had a bad feeling it wasn't cooked correctly. If that wasn't enough, I got food poisoning from it. I know it was the culprit because my fianc√© and I shared everything but that chicken. I did not drink (because I'm pregnant) but about 6 hours after my meal the nausea came in! This is incredibly dangerous for me because I'm in my first trimester and it increases the risk of miscarriage. I'm now in fear of my unborn child's life. Imagine if I would have ate the other 5 cubes of chicken! A whole day and a half later I'm still in bed SICK to my stomach. We paid close to $100 for our meal to have the chefs in the kitchen not know how to grill chicken correctly? Let alone a salad! Its unacceptable. I will never recommend this place other than tacos and drinks during happy hour."},{"name":"Bamboo Sushi","address":"836 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I haven't been here for a while since my last experience wasn't memorable, but a friend from Chicago wanted to go, decided to give another shot.

I ordered a causa and a lomo saltado, though I was hesitant because Peruvian restaurants in Orlando do not make good food. They usually lack seasoning, the proper ingredients and freshness. The causa came out and it wasn't good at all. The chicken was watery and seemed to be made with store bought mayonnaise. The lomo saltado was alright with the seasonings but the steak was too tough. After a few minutes the steak started becoming hard and very dry and it was no longer appetizing to say the least. This was my first Peruvian restaurant in a while and I'm not coming back.

It is a well-loved local institution.  Now, I strongly state up-front that this place is not for everyone.  If you go here expecting a classy Italian restaurant, you will be disappointed.I've never been here until last night.  I've always wanted to go.  You almost can't tell there's a restaurant there from the outside: all the windows are chock-full of old photos and signs, etc.We walked in last night - and it's dark in there.  All those covered windows keep out the light.  The place is dead.  There was NOBODY in there. Aside from one local lady, who was obviously a bit tipsy clinging to her giant wine glass while babbling really loudly to the single waitress there.  We were not greeted or even acknowledged as we walked in.  I assumed we had to seat ourselves so we did. There are 2 rooms.  One has the bar/pizza pickup station and a bunch of tables and the other is just a bigger dining room.  This particular day was hot outside and the second dining room was closed off.  (\\"No AC\\" the waitress mentioned when I looked in there).We sat down and took it all in.  The place looks like your dad collected all his old crap and just flung it everywhere.  And that is the charm of the place.  There's an old piano - which you could play if you wanted - no one will stop you.  Many photgraphs throughout the years of random people on the walls - some framed, some just sitting there.  About 15 mix-matched light fixtures hanging from the ceiling - seriously take a look - it's like a struggle to find 2 that match!  The floor is - geez I don't know - asbestos tiles from the 60s?  Who knows.  The rooms have some booths like you'd see at a pizza place, and some tables with chairs that look like they were stolen from your old high-school.  All the tables have different crummy tablecloths.  It's bizzare and a disaster but - again - part of the charm.  I took some pics and posted them here for you to see for yourself!We sat back and the waitress came over after the drunk finished her current rant.  Thankfully that lady left soon after we showed up - WOW was she loud and annoying!  But we got menus, and ordered drinks and figured we'd try their \\"Famous\\" Zaza pizza.  Menu says it's some big secret patented recipe blah blah.  Yah I'll be the judge of that.It didn't take long to arrive.  But the place had nobody in it after that drunk left so, you'd expect your stuff to be quick!  A few other small families did wander in for dinner during our stay.  But still only a handful of people during this evening - not that I'm complaining.  I like it quiet.Pizza came out - it didn't look like anything special and seriously it's not.  It was a big standard pizza-joint pizza, with nice fresh tomato sauce - big chunks of tomato, light mozzerellla sprinkled on top with some diced basil here and there.  And you know what, it was GOOD.  I really liked it.  The crust I wasn't too crazy about but the flavor of the pizza overall was very nice.  It was greasy / watery: seriously it was like it had tomato-basil-infused water on it - but I didn't mind it!  It was really good!  I want some now.  Good pizza-beer pizza.We paid cash - because as I'd heard the place was cash-only.  But we had a nice dinner there.  I mean, it wasn't AMAZING but I really liked it.

Furreal.This is the best service I've ever had. I made a reservation for my husband's 30th birthday on a Thursday night. We arrived a bit early and I was afraid we would have to wait, but nope! They wished him a happy birthday as soon as I gave them my name and sat us. The manager took us to our table and introduced himself. He even gave us his card and told us about their taco place on the Westside. Told us to drop his name over there. He was fabulous. It was just beginning to get chilly when we went, so when we were seated outside, I was worried. No need to worry: fire, heaters, and BLANKETS. It was amazing. I was even offered an extra blanket, but I was perfectly comfortable with just one. This was both of our first times, so our main server (main because we had two servers plus the manager who stopped by at least three times) explained the menu and recommended his top favorite dishes. We ordered:\\nhouse cured olives\\nroasted garlic bulbs - These were good, but tricky to eat. We probably wouldn't order them again.\\nsummer sausage - I think it was the Picante. It was spicy, but was served with grapes, which were surprisingly the perfect compliment to the heat.\\nchorizo and sweet-sour figs - Very good!\\nmeatballs (Albondigas) - Our second favorite dish.\\ngrilled hanger steak - Would order ten plates of this next time. So delicious!This was almost too much food for the two of us, so you could get away with ordering less. We also ordered two cocktails each, which were fabulous. They were served by the bartender who made sure we were satisfied with our order. Then we were served TWO complimentary birthday desserts (the chocolate cake and the crepes) plus champagne complete with a Russian toast from our server. Again, FABULOUS experience.The best thing: the bill was around $80, which I thought very reasonable for such an amazing experience plus four drinks and lots of food.The only negatives I can muster: there was a wait for the bathroom because they only have a few singular WCs. I could see this being a problem on a really busy night. If you've never been, trying to find the place is a little difficult as the sign isn't very big. There's valet, but we drove past it and ended up paying to park in a different lot. We sat outside, which seemed to be roomier than the inside. The tables inside were very close together.

Mac and Cheese....this is one of my favorite dishes in soul food being I grew up to it. This restaurants Mac and Cheese was watery, and the noodles isnt macaroni....add more cheese to it and macaroni...\\n3. for soul food it was expensive.I live in New York and I know a lot of soul food places where its affordable. Its suppose to be for family and the soul. It was very pricy for a restaurant. Maybe the fact its in South End.. Soul food isn't about how to make the food but the love you put into the food. I would not come back to this restaurant for soul food. I will look elsewhere."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Avalon suggested the table side guacamole and ....... it was bomb!

And I followed the standard protocol - made reservations at the bar for 5:30...got there around 20 mins early, waiting and was eventually seated at the bar. They have a pretty decent craft beer offering, some on draft, plenty in cans/bottles. I opted for the Springdale Brigadeiro (breakfast stout) and it was served up by a pretty awesome bartender (he had a pretty tough customer who was big on Tanqueray for her cocktail, which they didn't carry, and refused anything else. He went the extra 10 miles and said he'd make a believer out of her and whipped her up two cocktails with different gins to take a stab to see if she'd like any - and made a believer out of her).Anyways, I ordered the Craigie burger medium rare with bacon, with a side salad instead of fries (...to offset the bacon).  The burger came out, along with an ornate tray of topping options - and it looked glorious (kept eating rather light in prep for this meal). The burger had a nice blacktop char/crunch to it, but unfortunately was over-cooked and tasted quite bland.  I didn't want to send it back (I was pretty famished) and I didn't want to use the ketchup (which is apparently meticulously crafted for the burger), but I had to slather some one with whatever pickles and toppings laid in front of me. Ironically enough, 'thank god' I ordered the bacon.After I asked for the check, the bartender poured me a courtesy glass of bitters (Amaro Abano) and freshly-baked oatmeal cookie. Again, the service was fantastic.So, while probably just an off-night or something, my Craigie burger experience was a bit of a let down."},{"name":"Harvard Gardens","address":"316 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Very nice place to let the workday behind you and enjoy time with friends!

Cupcakes, chocolate covered strawberries, cannoli, pie... they have nearly one of everything that you could possibly want. I love that they offer a bottomless coffee with a self serve area that has soy AND almond milk (something that another huge coffee titan has yet to hop onto).

I may have already had dinner and then drinking gives me the craving but it doesn't matter; I will still order Chinese food.  When I have reached the point where I can hardly stand and my nose is bleeding profusely from having fallen once already, I am not asking much from Americanized Chinese food.  I just want something spicy, filling, and not too greasy.  Surely that is a modest expectation.So I ordered the Beef Lo Mein and some wantons to go with it from MixMenu.com.  When the driver called, he sounded annoyed.  Nothing new, I thought.  A lot of drivers sound a bit gruff over the phone.  So I managed to crawl down the staircase, my head spinning, as much with the prospect of shoveling some fatty Chinese food into my face as from the beer.  The driver pulled up and marched up to me.  Wordlessly, he handed me the paper bag.  As far as rudeness goes, he was breaking records.  Slightly peeved, I plucked the bag from his hand and, almost immediately, he thrust a piece of paper and a pen in my chest and hissed, \\"Sign!\\"I signed and returned the sheet.  The only time I saw a flicker of emotion from the driver was when he saw blood flowing from the gash on my nose.  I can safely say that I have never encountered a delivery driver who was so openly hostile.  I have since ordered again from these guys and I know that it isn't just that one driver.  They are all equally hostile.  If they were just acting like they hated their jobs and every other living being on the planet, they deserve Oscars.The Lo Mein was solidly average.  The beef was well done and the noodles were okay.  Unfortunately, it was bland and oily.  It was the first time in my life I had to paper towel-dry noodles.  The paper towel looked like I had dipped it in oil afterwards.  I had to add a little salt as well.  Only then did it do the trick and, even then, I could only eat half of it.  The greasiness started to become so difficult to face at this point that I had to \\"chase\\" each bite with a bite of the crispy wontons.  The shell of the wontons is good enough but the bizarre thing is that I have never encountered wontons with no meat in them.  It could be that I'm from the Midwest, but the entire point of wontons is that it is a dumpling, either soft or crispy.  What I had in front of me was a savory fortune cookie . .  . without the fortune bit.In fact, to sum up, I'd say that my fortune that night was pretty bad in general.  Not much can ruin my mood when I'm drunk as I'm a happy drunk.  But Nan Ling's Lo Mein did the trick.  It is generally a downer when your stomach feels like it contains a bowling ball.  The second time I ordered a beef entree and, surprisingly, I faced the same result.  It feels awful and I ended up reeking of the grease they used.  Still, because I wasn't asking much, I was prepared to give them at least two stars, maybe three.  But the fact that they are so hostile and hateful should earn them no more than half a star.  I don't care if I'm not dining in; if you're interacting with a paying customer, it is not asking too much to utter a pleasantry or two.  I would recommend Chang's House in Brighton.  Their lo mein has just the right amount of oil and a pleasant bite.  Not to mention that they are probably some of the friendliest people I've encountered in a small Chinese restaurant."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My sister takes me to Ruth's Chris every year for my birthday and we visit when we can of course.

Well presented with just enough flavour and sweetness and fresh berries\\n- Matcha Mochi Pancakes and the Milk Tea Pancakes: OK. The pancakes are definitely the lightest and fluffiest I've had.  But they don't really have a lot of flavour on their own.  It's the accompanying sauces and toppings that give it any taste.  Yes, they are very expensive but you can see why.  Each order is hand made so there is a lot of labour cost to make each one.  It'a not a regular pancake batter where you can a large amount in advance.  So yes, they are expensive if compared to regular pancakes, but still in same price range as other plates desserts which I think is a better comparison.

Years ago I swore this place off after they seemed to insult the entire nation of Thailand with a disgusting riff on phad thai.  Yet proximity (it's our closest Thai), hunger and desperation conspired against me and i actually had a 3 star experience here at some point while our little one was an infant and we were in that- order takeout or don't eat- up all night delirium phase  (she's one now, we're out of it).  Last night again, the desperation crept in after a long night of work and putting baby down, I was flying solo so ordered some delivery.  I ordered the spring rolls and the buddha noodles.  The spring rolls were fine, fried straight out of a freezer and nothing to complain about.  Now let's pause and think about the situations that potentially led up to the Buddha Noodles. 1.  The place was actually closed, but a couple of drunk frat guys broke in looking to steal Singha beers, saw my order come through on the computer screen, and took pity so did their best to recreate the buddha noodles.  Which involved canned vegetables, a lump of old rice noodles and some wet peanut butter thrown on top.  Thanks for trying guys, three cheers for alpha tau omega. 2.  Order comes through the screen, is received by an uninspired employee who has never actually eaten real Thai food, old noodles all stuck together are plopped on a bed of formerly canned and overcooked yet completely unseasoned vegetables, and a ladel-full of soupy peanut butter is dumped on top?  Garnish? ha! Let the food speak for itself.  3. I was featured on some reality show called \\"Eff this guy with gross Thai\\".  I'm still waiting for my release formLook- I much prefer to write a positive glowing happy review.  This place does have big portions, this place isn't that expensive, I'm sure the people that make the food are nice people.  Clearly though, I'm not who they are pandering to. I've spent months of my life in Thailand and have a weak spot for the food, for the flavors, the heat, the sour, the sweet, the salty, the people the culture etc...

There's a pretty long bar (given the size of the place) that is chock full of bottled brews and a handful of draft beers as well.  The beer menu is organized by category, which can definitely be helpful in navigating the expansive menu.  Beers range in price due to size and alcohol content, though nothing seems unfairly priced.As many others have written, the tater tots are off the chain!  I am partial to the Supreme variety, which comes with sweet caramelized onions, a balsamic reduction drizzled on top, and topped off with tangy blue cheese.  The full sizes are a generous portion, however on my most recent visit the server mentioned a half portion was available.  I'm also a big fan of the pretzel with spicy mustard, which is a great snack in the event you need a little something (or would rather save the space for beer).  The grilled cheese specials tend to be quite good as well, if you are looking for a sandwich.  A solid Kenmore Square watering hole, particularly if you are a craft beer fan.

In all fairness, it tasted good.  But it's fried calamari with a glaze.  Not too hard to make taste bad.  But for $14?  No thanks.  For our meals we had the bolognese and the scallops with risotto.  I think the chef is afraid of salt.  There was no seasoning to anything. Bland all around.  In particular, the bolognese was terrible.  I think it was boxed pasta, and it was like eating ground beef covered in cream of tomato soup.  Def not worth $19. I'm hoping the chef just had an off night.  But this was pretty bad.  If they want to charge what they charge they need step up the quality of you get.  The service was okay, and friendly.  They give you really good bread with hummus, which we enjoyed.

They led us to a private dining room which shielded us from the decibel level of the main dining room.  This allowed us to actually have great conversation with our guests instead of yelling and fighting boredom with shots.The sommelier who took care of us asked us if we wanted the TV in the private dining room on.  I thought this was weird.  We hadn't even introduced ourselves to our guests.  I told him that if conversation died on the vine like a rotten peach, he'd be the first to know.The waiter who refilled our glasses and the sommelier were friendly and energetic.  Almost cocaine energetic.  Everything was going well but I don't assume anything so I was in a somber, skeptical frame of mind when my starter, one giant meatball, arrived.  It was the biggest meatball I've ever seen.  It was like a mastodon's testicle.And it wasn't great.  A perfect meatball is soft but resists the force of your utensil at the same time.  Immediate give is a sign that a meatball wasn't cooked long enough or that not enough of a binding agent, like egg, was used.  In this case, the sheer dinosaur-nipple dimensions of the thing would have made it harder to cook all the way through and harder to pack together tightly.  It fell apart way too easily and felt more like a p√¢t√© in my mouth than a meatball.The flavors were okay.  I could taste the usual Italian herbs such as oregano and basil but that's all there was to it, aside from the flavor of beef.  The darkness of the meat suggested to me that they might have omitted pork.  A real Italian meatball is made from beef and pork, at a minimum, and sometimes even veal.  The flavor was one-dimensional but not terrible.  I finished the entire thing but only because I was hungry.  It was a lazy take on a real Italian meatball.I suggest splitting it up into two or three meatballs, using more breadcrumbs, and more fatty meat like pork or even sausage.  Play around with it a little.  Perhaps let it sit overnight so the meat becomes a little more compact.  Meatballs take effort.  Think of what god has to go through when he puts together baby testicles in heaven.  It's probably harder than putting together a ball of yarn.The sauce on the meatball was a little on the salty side.  I could tell that some effort had gone into it but it was lacking the trademark creaminess of a good tomato sauce.  A splash of heavy cream and a tablespoon or two of sugar would have balanced out the savory flavor of the sauce and prevented the watery consistency that makes it difficult to adhere to whatever else is on the plate.My entree was the Pappardelle Emiliana, pappardelle in a rag√π.I think a rag√π-based pasta dish is one of the best yardsticks for the ability of a chef in an Italian restaurant.  A rag√π forms the basis of so many dishes that it's the one thing a chef should get right.  It's like learning how to hold the paddle before you enter the kayak.I give the rag√π 3.5 stars.  It had all the right flavors, a good consistency, and just shy of enough salt to allow the diner to make his own adjustments without ruining the dish.  I like my bolognese on the creamier side so the only change I would make is to liberally grate Parmesan cheese over the dish and mix it up to allow it to get a little thicker.  Then I'd serve it immediately.Interestingly, the leftover pappardelle became thick on its own while I carried it home in a box.  I ate it later that night and it had come together beautifully.  At room temperature, and slightly thicker than it was in the restaurant, it was absolutely delicious.  But I don't care what it's like at home.  I want it to be great at the restaurant.Overall, eating at Strega gave me the same feeling as the time I saw my parents almost fall for a pyramid scheme: Measured excitement followed by disappointment.  They actually believed the slick representative would give them a five-star hotel room on a nearby island if they attended a presentation and gave their honest feedback.  The \\"presentation\\" turned out to be forty-five minutes of begging for money.From outside the presentation room, I heard my dad heckling the speaker, who started stuttering nervously.  My dad's a douche and I usually root for whoever's heckling him but I was as pissed off as he was, so I laughed hearing the jittery conman trip over his words.  \\"P-p-please s-sit down, s-s-sir!\\"Dad walked out with smoke coming out of his ears and, reading my thoughts, shook his head.No vacation.Like its neighbors Empire and Committee, Strega is a great place to come to if you want a glittery backdrop to your drinking.  If you're in the mood to get a little whored up and ask out the person you swiped right, this will impress them.  But I'd go elsewhere for real Italian food."},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Terramia Ristorante is THE perfect date night spot.

Nothing else on the menu enticed me. My friend ordered the salmon Benedict. After a seemingly long time, our waitress appeared with benedicts in hand & said she didn't want our food to get cold. She explained the kitchen was still making the grits. Err? Ok. I wasn't asked if I wanted something else instead. I would've opted for fruit if given the option. We ate our benedicts...mine was fine but my friend's was SO overpoweringly salty and heavily laced with onions. It was like taking a bite of an onion doused in salt (was that an attempt to conceal non-fresh salmon or is it always so unbalanced?!). \\nYuck!I'd already finished my benedict (and I'm a slow eater!) by the time the grits were brought out. After all that time I expected them to knock my socks off but the city grits didn't thrill my tastebuds at all. They were more rural than city grits, lol! Where do they come up with these names? When the check came, it seemed like a no brainer they would comp the grits. It would've been a nice gesture, but they did not. Someone who seemed to be a manager came by (sans introduction) to return the check, but nary a word about the 30 minute delayed order. Oh well. Our server was polite.

You can always tell when a place is new like this because they are by the book with their corporation specs for portion size (especially compared to a couple of their little Greek neighbors).

I stumbled across this Japanese restaurant during my first visit to Portland while walking around the streets of downtown. Their food is cooked (and the restaurant is ran) by sweet ladies who came from Japan, with about two locations in their country. You place an order at the counter and can watch them prepare your dish. After placing an order, you just find any table you want to sit at and they will bring you your plate when it's ready. Their originally location was much larger with traditional Japanese seating, but they've moved to a more secluded section of downtown (end restaurant of the building they're currently in, right next to a closed off street that's under construction) and it's a much tinier restaurant, more fitting for a quick eat and go rather than dine in and chill. I've tried their Kale Doria with chicken, usually with Mozzarella, and also with both Mozzarella and Cheddar cheese. The plate comes very hot (the high temp. melts the cheese to perfectly coat the whole top of the dish), so be very careful not to touch it. The food remains hot or warm during the whole time you're eating, which is due to the high temperature it comes out in. If you order to go, they cannot melt the cheese or sell kale doria the same way simply because the heat is too high for a plastic container, so I'd recommend dining in at least once before you order to go. I loved this dish so much that it made my #1 dish I'd ask for before I'd die.

I aimed to come at a weird time so I could have a better chance of dining in. Got there around 9:20pm on a Monday and since I was dining alone I was able to get seated promptly. However, I did get awkwardly put at a table where a couple was already dining but I'm just fortunate I was able to get seated at all. Giacomo's is a tiny, cozy, and dimly lit restaurant that seats less than 40. I wasn't a fan of the bread. It was rather cold but since it was technically \\"free\\" I won't rag on it. If you smother it with your pasta sauce it will be glorious though.I am no stranger to Frutti Di Mare but Giacomo's Frutti Di Mare is top notch. The seafood is just so ridiculously fresh, I could go on and on about it. It makes such a huge difference when your scallops, shrimps, mussels and clams are fresh and good quality. So in love with the scallops...they were just so tender and delicious. The mussels were excellent, no grittiness to them whatsoever. You are able to choose between 6 of their sauces for your linguine dishes. I chose the fracomo sauce since it is a combination of the fra diavolo and their signature Giacomo sauce. The fracomo sauce was sooo flavorful and had a nice kick to it.

Literally!!If you don't know, Chinese Sauerkraut Fish Restaurant serves.....well, Chinese Sauerkraut Fish (Suan Cai Yu). This place is located in Richmond along the No. 3 Rd.They make their own sour cabbage and you can see many large clay pots when you walk into the restaurant. The interior is becoming the norm for most new Chinese restaurants with the black walls and darker tones all around. Get ready though because it really smell sour in there.First thing you apparently need before you come here is a smartphone. Why? Because you have to scan a QR code on the table to open the restaurants website and order your meal through there. How....modern? I guess my flip phone won't work huh? And I guess no need for any interactions with servers.The menu isn't very extensive. It's pretty much the Chinese Sauerkraut Fish, add ons to it, and appetizers. The fish is served in a giant plate served family style. You can order a small, medium, or large. The large is epically big and perfect for a large party, but it was just the two of us, so we opted for the small.We started with the Spicy Boneless Cold Chicken Feet and Tong Ho (Chrysanthemum Leaves) Salad. The chicken feet was pretty good with nice flavors and no bones! The Salad was exceedingly salty and overdressed. After each bite, I needed a sip of water. Both were really small portions.The small Suan Cai Yu was still a big plate. It had one fish, head included with thinly sliced pieces. It tasted liked Tilapia, a pretty dry and lean fish, but it was probably some\\ncarp. The smell was pungent and the taste and flavors were strong. You get a good hot of spice from the dried chili peppers, a strong numbing sensation from the Sichuan peppercorns, and the mouth Pickering sourness from the cabbage. It was on tHe oily side, but my biggest issue was the extreme saltiness. It can get difficult to eat and I see why you need add ons. We got a bowl of rice and it was the tiniest scoop I've ever seen. It was like a kids size portion!Overall, it was hard to get away from the saltiness of the fish and salad. It's like this meal was suppose to balance out all the bland tasting Chinese restaurants I've been to the last week, but I prefer bland over incredibly salty. I'm not sure if the staff are friendly or not as there wasn't any words said. When paying, they just bring you the card reader machine and you do it yourself and just leave the machine on the table.Not only did I leave Chinese Sauerkraut Fish with a sour taste in my mouth, I left with a salty one too!"},{"name":"Revelry","address":"210 SE Mlk Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"When I was in Seattle, one of my best meals was at Revel so when I found out there was a sister restaurant in Oregon, I had to go.The music was way too loud, my ear drums were still ringing when I left.

Everywhere we ate in Boston was amazing. I always do my research before heading to a city, so I'm not surprised I loved everywhere I ate. We got to the Salty Pig, and again my boyfriend (John) and I for some reason think we don't need reservations on Friday and Saturday nights, but hey, bar seating!! We were told they didn't have any tables but the bar was full service and we were more than welcome to sit there, so we chose to do so.  They have a build your own charcuterie board, which I loved. The restaurant also has a very authentic atmosphere. Big wood fire oven for pizza and a pigs leg on the sliced. Anyways, we got prosciutto cotto, duck liver mousse, la tur cheese, and marcona almonds to start. It was out so quickly and our waitress made sure we didn't run out of bread, thank you!! The cheese was very creamy with a nice flavor. We both enjoyed it and I was thrilled to have the duck liver. I am a big fan from my time abroad in Europe and don't have it often. John was even willing to try it. Regarding the prosciutto, I was hoping for more of a jamon iberico - but that's my fault. We shared what my boyfriend described as the best pasta he's ever had as our first course. It was seriously good. Home made pasta is hardly ever bad, but we literally scraped our plate clean to save the remaining sauce for our pizza crust. The pasta was the prosciutto agnolotti. My mouth waters thinking of it. Served with English peas, mint, and parmesan. Our main course was the lecco pizza. I love cheese. It has mozzarella, crescenza, ricotta, pecorino cheese and sun chokes. The pecorino was so good and the four cheeses together were really nice. I also really enjoyed the sunchokes. They were light and subtle but added a really nice discrete flavor and texture. The pizza was thin crust and perfectly crispy.  I liked it so much that I saved a slice for later.Cheers to the Salty Pig. I love the name, ambiance, and food here. They also have a beautiful menu.

It was a toss up between this place and the Passage to India next door.  I have been to Passage to India before, and I really liked it, but for adventure's sake, we decided to check out Edgewater Cafe instead.  I hadn't read anything about it before and wasn't sure what to expect.  But it was a big mistake.  In addition to being ridiculously expensive considering the area (it cost us $50 for two entrees, two iced teas, and two bottles of beer), it was pretty gross.  They didn't have much in the way of vegetarian options, so we both opted for the vegetarian delight, which was COVERED in cheese.  I mean, you couldn't even see what was below all the cheese because there were just mountains of it all over the plate.  And then, once I managed to unearth the actual food underneath, I discovered that it was all STUFFED with cheese too!  It was just SO MUCH CHEESE!  Who ever wants that much cheese?!  One would think that the vegetarian delight might, I don't know, contain vegetables?  But nope.  No vegetables.  Just cheese.  And a tiiiiny amount of beans.  The Border Cafe blows this place out of the water, and we can both eat there for about HALF as much money (plus they serve hot tortilla chips).Oh, and the bathroom?  VILE!  The floor was a sticky disaster the whole way there.  And on my way there, since I wasn't sure where it was, I asked a waitress to direct me there.  It was occupied, so I was waiting for the person to come out, and all the while all of the waitresses were standing up at their little posts about 5 feet behind me talking about how much they hated telling people where the bathroom was.  Oh really?  You don't like telling people where the bathrooms are?!  THEN DON'T BECOME A WAITRESS!

But, I've seen the light, I've drank the Salt Lick Kool-aid and I finally \\"get it.\\"Salt Lick is selling an experience. From the moment you pull into the dusty parking lot, you will feel that down-home Texan charm. You'll see that there is a folk band playing on the rickety stage, because it's Saturday. With a BYOB beer in hand, you will find yourself drawn in to the atmosphere and hoping the the 40+ minute wait turns into an hour or two. Then you'll be buzzed to your table and as you walk past the pit of meat the smell will send hunger pangs deep into your stomach. The meat can't come soon enough. You'll scope the menu out, but you know you want the 3-meat plate so you can try it all. You add some smooth potato salad and fresh slaw, too and delude yourself into believing you can eat everything. You're that hungry. When the food arrives, you'll decide to skip the sauce - you're a purist. The tender meat will basically fall off the bone and slide down your throat with little effort. The brisket will have a peppery bark, the sausage will be plump and juicy, and the ribs, oh the ribs will be your favorite. Once you steal a bit of turkey and chicken from your friends plates, you'll decide that all the meat lives up to the hype. You're sold.

A few minutes later, the hostess came back and moved us outside by surprise, to a nice quiet table with a perfect server. I believe the hostess and manager both got together to accommodate us moving tables, which was greatly appreciated since we understood how busy they were. I really want to thank the hostess and manager on duty last night (7/2/18). We also had an extremely positive experience with the wine guru at Barcelona. She was extremely helpful, patient, and down to earth so that we weren't intimidated. Got us the perfect bottle of wine, and we drank two, then the night went fuzzy after that.

Food-wise, I was mostly just underwhelmed, in particular with their unmemorable and dry char siu pork--yes, even bathed in the ramen broth it still managed to be dry. The noodles were fairly enjoyable though. Whereas the food was underwhelming, the service was lacking. We weren't served water until we flagged down someone else's waitress (because we couldn't get the attention of ours) and even then, our water never got refilled.

The space is modern and clean.  The menu highlights street food and sushi.  They also have a full bar and unique cocktail list.  I should have ordered more of the street food vs. sushi.  After eating here I read other reviews which all positively recommended the street food menu items.  The sushi was hit or miss.  The night we went our albacore tuna was tough and had a weird texture and lacked flavor.  The usage and unagi rolls was also lacking in flavor, and just OK.  The spicy tuna rolls were tasty, and my favorite was the all fish sushi roll (the most expensive on the menu).  The fish tasted fresh, melted in my mouth, and was full of flavor.  The server had recommended it as his favorite, and I can see why.  The dumplings are soup dumplings and AMAZING.  These are some of the best dumplings I have had.  The Sake Colada was OK.  It was a bit too heavy on the Malibu coconut flavored rum (which tastes like sun tan lotion).  However, it was a work of art and looked like a masterpiece.  The shaved fruit ice dessert was tasty and definitely perfect for sharing with four people.  It wasn't too sweet, and was full with fresh fruit.  The mango sorbet that came with it was creamy, smooth, and yummy!The service was friendly and attentive.  The owner was there and chatting with everyone.

There was a party in front of us with just one person who was there at the party, yet got seated before us even though we were all present. That was fine. The Lady who was manning the front desk ushered them to their seat, and told us our turn would be next. After two more parties went ahead of us, my mother quietly asked the lady \\"when is it our turn? If the wait is too long, please let us know.\\"The lady cut her off, telling my mother \\"If you want to leave, leave!\\" She continued to slam her desk, and that was when I had to speak up to the disservice. First of all, it is terrible customer service to speak to a customer like that. Secondly, I knew damn well that if we had been a group of a different ethnic background, she would not have treated us the way she did. I continued to tell her that we surely were not going to wait any longer, and I told my mother and girlfriend that we would take our business elsewhere.That's not all; as we continued walking out the door, I heard her mutter \\"This is why I don't like serving the Chinese.\\"First of all, lady, your cuisine is listed as Chinese/Thai.

It's the middle of January and there's big piles of snow on the ground while the temperature is hovering at close to 25 degrees. Yep, the weather sucks but what it means is that there was NO WAIT to get in. Seriously, it's sometimes two hours. Today? Five minutes.We got a burrata to share and it was excellent. Good sized portion (about the size of your fist) and topped with fresh basil and drizzled with a sweet balsamic. And then we also got a large platter of calamari. Big portion, very fresh and crisp with just a little bit of heat going on. Tasty stuff.This time, I chose the shrimp and scallops off the menu. Topped with the Giacomo sauce, which is a spicy red sauce that has a bit of cream in there, on top of a big pile of fresh made linguine. A big portion with lots of flavor and lots of sauce for their store-made bread to scoop up. Maybe there could have been more seafood in here, but it was still a good portion for $21.Service was excellent. Attentive, speedy and great at clearly dirty dishes while keeping the wine glasses filled.Definitely worth the wait, even if it's not 25 degrees."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"7160 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"\\"Boo hiss, omfg!  Olive Garden is NOT REAL ITALIAN FOOD, I have *BEEN* to Italy, once, on a tour bus, we went to *authentic* Italian restaurants as planned by the tour company, and my GRANDMA is Italian, and she does NOT make the same food as Olive Garden and she knows where it's AT you loser!  The food I had in ITALY six YEARS AGO is NOT THE SAME as Olive Garden, I am BETTER THAN YOU because I can recognize and appreciate GOOD ITALIAN FOOD and you can't!\\"So the story always goes, you hear this same rant every time you talk about Olive Garden and one of OG's haters is within earshot.  I really pity these types of pretentious people who cannot just go out and have a no frills, really good meal and enjoy it.  Whoever said Olive Garden was in a contest to be the most authentic Italian food out there?  It's Americanized Italian food.  Sometimes I just want something simple in my life, like a late lunch at OG on an otherwise boring weekend.  And, yes, I'll admit I like to eat here and brag about it to others because I'm comfortable with my palate.I went here for lunch with my friend this past Saturday around 1:30.  The service was stellar--the girl who waited on us was really nice, attentive and just super good at what she does, and she seemed genuinely satisfied with her job.  I'm not the biggest fan of their pasta dishes, but there are certain things here that I like and that OG does really well--well to the point of 4 stars.  I usually get their soup, salad and breadsticks lunch.  Yes, I'm aware that the salad is *just iceberg* (GASP, OMFG, how could you eat that??) lettuce, but I like it.  I love the dressing, and I like the other items tossed into the salad--huge black olives, pepperoncini, croutons, strong red onions and tomatoes.  I also like the freshly grated cheese that goes over the top of the salad--and I always have them grate lots of it.  Honestly, I don't like salad in general (if you've read my other reviews you will know this) but this is a salad that I can eat.  It tastes good and makes me happy.For the soup I got the pasta fagioli (fah-jewel).  I love this soup--it's like chili but with Italian style spices instead of chili powder and cumin.  It was really good today, and with the chill in the air this weekend it really warmed me up and put a smile on my face.  With the soup and salad we had some hot, yummy breadsticks that I crave.  I always  get a side of alfredo sauce for dipping.  I LOVE OG's aflredo sauce, in fact, it's the only alfredo sauce I will eat.  I was semi-irked to see that the price had gone up to $3.25 for a side of it, but I'm so addicted to it I'm willing to pay whatever.We didn't get entrees, but instead split an appetizer sampler platter.  We got the stuffed mushrooms, calamari and toasted ravioli.  All were excellent.  I really like the stuffed mushrooms here--they're just about perfect.  The mushrooms are stuffed with a cheese and minced clam mixture and always come out piping hot.  I want some right now.  The calamari was great, and as I do most places when I get fried calamari, I request that it be cooked extra crispy.  With a squirt of lemon and some marinara this is excellent.  The toasted raviolis were also perfect.That's it.  Not really a better lunch around.  I did notice that they have upgraded/updated the decor at this one, and not really to my liking.  I think they are trying to be more upscale or something, but I'm not really digging it.  They got rid of those trademark cushioned vinyl chairs with wheels that were really comfy and this kind of made me sad.  I'll be back again.  It is what it is--Americanized Italian food."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Outstanding Mexican food.

I remember being so excited that my neighborhood finally had a bar with good food and a great beer selection, not to mention the nice playlist they had going on. These days, the Porter is essentially a Little Five institution, and it seems that their reputation and longevity has allowed the service and quality to falter. After a long break of not coming to the Porter, I went twice recently on Friday nights. Of course, it was packed both nights, but the wait for a table was not too bad on either night. I do not think, however, that the Porter should get a pass on having consistent service and food quality just because it is busy. On the first Friday that we went, I went with a group of four. The server was attentive and all of the food was great. We all had different beers and I got to try the fish and chips, special tacos, samosas (which are shaped more like spring rolls), and the crack pie. No complaints. On my most recent trip, I was with a friend and we just wanted to get a couple of beers and a snack to catch up, so we ordered the fries. When they finally came out, the fries were limp and lukewarm, as if they had been sitting to get dropped off for a while. The garlic aioli was also not garlicky at all and lacked flavor. This was such a stark contrast to the fries with the fish that I had at my earlier visit, which were fresh, crispy fries that one expects a french fry to be. The server was nowhere to be found and did not check in with us on how everything was, nor did he even question why we hadn't touched the fries when we asked for the check. We ended up going to the Yacht Club a few doors down for a fried potato redo and were not disappointed.This sort of inconsistency is, unfortunately, something that I've experienced with the Porter before in years past. For instance, I've had nearly-burnt goat cheese fritters that were runny in the center. I've also been served raw fish and chips that indicated that the fryer temp was just way too high. The Porter has a great beer selection, for sure, and it's in a great location, but it's just too hit or miss to warrant a higher rating from me."},{"name":"Cibo e Beve","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 245","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We went to Cibo e Beve after seeing it on Atlanta Eats.

However, I'm still peeved about it and I'll tell you why. As the reader you'll have to decide whether I'm being reasonable or not. I live in Miami but my family is in Portland so I visit fairly often. I've been wanting to try Langbaan for years as I've heard amazing things about it. However, it's always been tough to get in during my travel days. Well, this time I finally got in! A reservation for four last minute! I was so excited to finally try this place and was looking forward to it all day, but just before dinner time something terrible happened, I started to feel sick. I tried to shake it off, convince myself I wasn't really getting sick  but it kept creeping up on me.By dinner time I was feeling pretty lousy but still telling myself I was fine, it was just the Oregon weather that I wasn't used to, I hadn't drank enough water, etc. The first course was served and I took a bite, which pushed me over the edge and I ran to the bathroom, finally acknowledging that I was really sick and would not be able to dine. I felt horrible as I had organized this dinner with my mother and two of my best friends. So, I left them my credit card to pay and told them to please not worry about me and to enjoy the meal as I left to the car to sleep. I realize thus far I've just written a story about getting sick and that is has nothing to do with the restaurant, so what's my gripe? Well, simply that they offered $0 in discount for me not attending dinner. Again, I know, of course, that this is not their fault. I also know that if I hadn't snagged the reservation that someone else would have and they would have made the full amount from a table of four. That being said, it was an unfortunate circumstance, completely out of my control, and I did not in fact dine with them. I was forced to leave at the beginning of the meal and so had almost none of the food or alcohol. And yet, the bill was $660 plus tip coming out to $780. It is just my personal opinion that as a restaurant they should have given at least some discount due to the situation. The fact that they did not, that they charged full-price to someone they did not feed, really leaves me unhappy with the management of this establishment.

May still have been a mix, but at least it wasn't wallpaper paste! Came on delicious fluffy biscuits, and the accompanying sausage, eggs and potatoes were all fresh and tasty.Second time around was lunch and oh man, they have seasoned fries! Also tater tots that were nice and crispy, not mushy and reminiscent of school cafeteria lunch. I got their hickory burger, minus the BBQ...sad to see that their \\"Wisconsin cheddar\\" was processed cheese slices - I'm from a Wisconsin family, I know my cheese, and I'm expecting a solid cheese slice, not a waxy plastic sliver. That aside, the bacon was well cooked, fresh toppings, and the meat actually had flavor! I'm sick of these thin, flavorless burgers - good to see one that tasted beyond beef and had some thickness so I could specify medium-rare (more to the medium, but it was still juicy).My roommate got the goat cheese topped burger which I would've eaten that alone (and will next time, it's an appetizer). Fried to perfection and oozed so well once bitten into on the burger.Only serious complaint aside from my cheese was that they had cream of chicken soup as that day's special. I love cream soups, so I ordered a cup. We got our burgers and the waiter (who wasn't too attentive) said the soup was coming right up. I was half way through my burger before it arrived in what looked like a side bowl for a condiment like gravy. The flavor was bland and it was super thick, it really was almost like chicken gravy...although I'm not entirely certain it was chicken. It had a non-descript flavor with chunks of potatoes and some kind of meat that had more of the texture of clams than chicken. In fact, had you not told me it was cream of chicken, I would've guessed bland clam chowder.Speaking of the waiter, he was...well, for lack of better word, lame. Nice enough, but almost a fake nice. We never had refills on our drinks and when I mentioned my disappointment in the soup I could tell it was in one ear and out the other.It sounds like the bulk of my review is negative, but really I do like this place and will continue going.

Unfortunately it's fine, just fine. It's like a worse version of sweetgreen, but with the same weirdly high prices. Except you're not in New York or San Francisco or LA, but paying the same high prices anyway. I think the issue is that the salads have too much going on. The chef made salads are made up with a lot of different ingredients, and it can be a bit much/skew on the unhealthy side if that's what you're here for. You can opt for simplicity and build your own, but with the extensive ingredients list, it can also be overwhelming to navigate for first time customers (or honestly, even occasional customers). And even if you opt for less ingredients than what you get for free, you still end up paying the same price. So that sucks. IMO, the menu needs to be reworked to feature simpler, classic salads that are less gimmicky. Also, warm grains would be nice. The production line is also not as efficient as it could be. In this particular location, the bar is set up really poorly: if there's any line at all, it tends to back up into the entrance and cause crowding for folks who are trying to enter and exit. In general, Garden Bar locations are not well designed to handle crowds -- I think the Pearl location has similar issues.And depending on who's making your salad/if there's a crowd ahead of you, the salad makers are not as speedy as they could be and tend to backup pretty quickly. Part of it also comes down to the way the production line is set up. There are some ingredients that could be prepped before hand to make things go faster; take avocados and eggs, for instance. While it's certainly pretty to have your avocados and eggs beautifully sliced on top of the salad, these could be sliced and prepped beforehand to help speed up things for the salad makers.I feel bad for leaving this criticism, as the folks at this location are genuinely nice and work hard. Service is pretty good. But in general, the food and the design of the space needs work. It's not worth the prices they're charging for, currently."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"King Bao is another great restaurant in the Mills50 area.

Next time I'll share tots with someone. I got the Hogzilla, firecracker shrimp and a Glen Rhee bao. All of them were amazing and unique. Next time I need to save room for the desert baos! They look great!"},{"name":"Thai Win","address":"8292 SW Nyberg St","city":"Tualatin","stars":"3","text":"Good Thai food.

Full power, blinding. These are the type of lights that light up houses at Christmas. Spend a few bucks and buy a dimmer. The rest of the restaurant is almost as bright. Does no one remember the atmosphere of Chinese restaurants and especially their lounges in the 1960's and 70's?? The place was completely empty at 7 on a Saturday night.

Not being from Chicago I can't speak to it's authenticity in terms of a Chicago style dog. I'm not a fan of unnaturally colored neon food. I prefer relish that doesn't look like it has radiation poisoning. That being said, as a stand alone experience this was fine. Nothing mind blowing, nothing really special or unique - it was just a hot dog. I had a spicy kraut dog and it was tasty. Vienna beef hot dogs are not my favorite - although the spicy version at least had some good flavor. I like a dog that snaps when I bite into it and I like them garlicky. The kraut here was average and all they offer are chopped onions, not grilled. The bun is a very soft, fresh chicago style poppy seed. Truly the fries were the star of the meal - and the one place where they showed ingenuity. They were fresh cut and very crispy (I'm guessing double fried) with nice potato flavor. But I think, if you are a hot dog place, the dogs should really be the main event. If you wax poetic for Chicago style hot dogs then this place will probably tick all your boxes as that seems to be their target crowd and all the fixings cater to that genre. But if you are looking for a signature hot dog experience with incredibly flavorful well crafted dogs and interesting, thoughtful toppings you will be disappointed here.  They do serve Coke products, though! ;-)"},{"name":"Garden Bar by Evergreens","address":"1061 NE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is probably my favorite salad place!

I made an online order, because I wanted it ready by the time I got there. Also it was easier to do an online order since it was a custom salad (rather than stating everything I wanted while in the restaurant).

I don't (sadly) get to L5P much these days, but The Porter is definitely one of my favorite destinations there.  The Porter is tucked into what used to be an alleyway between two buildings.

I'm not hugely into beer, but I know what questions to ask to find stuff I like, and the staff here never fails to deliver.  Heck, they seem really intimately familiar with their beer menu, and could probably recite it on request.  The last time I went, I had the Sugo (papardelle over a lamb stew).  This thing was fantastically delicious.  I'm not lying when I say I've found myself daydreaming about it twice since I ate it.  There are other favorites on the menu.  The bangers look bangin'!

The food was delicious.  The atmosphere was a complete and utter disaster.  Parents chatting over their sandwiches while their brat-offspring complained and beat on the tables with their grubby, crumb-laden hands.  Toys, carts, and bibs were strewn about the furniture and floor.Despite the sign outside telling (begging?) parents to leave their strollers at the door, one dad dismissed it and was determined to push his 12-wheeled DUALLY stroller down Flour's anorexically-thin aisles.I guess there just comes a time in every young father's life when you say to yourself, \\"shit.

The staff was super sweet, especially to our toddler who didn't feel like sitting still for a meal and just wanted to run around.

Even before the music or the dancing begins. It's raucous around dinner time, but quite lovely for brunch or lunch with the sun streaming in, though still kind of loud, in a bustling cafe sort of way. The dancing is fun, though I don't recommend one of the tables near the stage, because little bits of dust and debris fling dangerously close to my food as the dancers high kick across the stage.  The music is hit or miss depending on your taste, I suppose, but the bands rotate, and sometimes there's a great mix of traditional Irish tunes with some Irish rock, which I could listen to all night. But other times it's more pop-based, sort of like what I imagine an Irish wedding band would sound like. And that can get tiresome if you can't tune it out, depending on where you're sitting. The food is what keeps us coming back though. The Nom Nom Wings, though I feel stupid even typing that, it's worth the momentary embarrassment of ordering something with a cutesy name. They have this sweet and spicy soy glaze and come with a side of house-made honey mustard, that I could bathe in, it's so amazing. Get extra and dip the chips from the fish and chips into it. The kids macaroni and cheese is so delicious, you'll eat most of it yourself.

It was that night that I discovered Belgian beers that remain my favourite.The next time I went, it was for a foodie event organized by Andrew Morrison who eventually went on to spearhead Scout Magasine.  It was gluttonous, and also remains one of the highlights of my eating career.  The following time was with my family for another Dineout,... short rib this time,... 3 for 3 trips here blew me away.This was all pre-reno, and frankly since the room was in my opinion also the best in the city form an ambiance POV that talk of changing it really worried me.Today, my family took me for a birthday brunch. First off the the place looks amazing! more spacious, a patio,.. completely updated but with some of the original great features incorporated, and more natural light.  I suspect at night it will feel a bit more like the old place but for daylight, again tops as far as Vancouver options go.  And the food? Yowsa! Fricking blew me away, top 3 breakfast of a lifetime, and everyone else agreed.You may have noticed I have yet to mention price.

Though it was not that spicy for being called oxtail on fire. We loved the crispiness/crunchiness of the fried plantains. It added a nice sweetness to the savory dishes. The empanadas were very flakey and buttery. I preferred the spinach and cheese one over the Cuban hash. Though, my boyfriend enjoyed the Cuban beef hash more for the flavorful meat filling.

It's a small place around the corner from Joy Theater in Tigard. Everything on the menu are below $10. My sis and I were pretty thrilled to see the menu offerings. They are serving food that we used to eat daily in Jakarta. So we got the Martabak Telur (deep fried pastry made out of eggs, flour, and green onions) for appetizers. Three pieces for about $3. Then I got Empek Empek for my entree. What the hell Empek Empek you might ask. Empek Empek is fishpaste pastry filled with egg served on yellow noodle with spicy sweet and sour sauce. The sweet and sour sauce here is not the Red Chinese sweet & sour sauce. It's brown color like soy sauce but it's sweet & sour. The Empek Empek was delicious, but I prefer the sauce to be more sour than how it was.My sister got the Nasi Gudeg which has steamed rice, jackfruit stew, white chicken curry, hardboiled egg, spicy tofu curry, sambal, and shrimp cracker. Both of us love the sambal which is the Indonesian chili sauce. It was so HOT which we loooooveeeeee...My sis' boyfriend enjoyed his Nasi Kapau which has steamed rice, beef rendang, curry veggies, steamed kale, and green sambal. I didn't get to try his meal because I was full. He said it was delicious and he liked it.They serve other basic Indonesian dishes too such as Gado Gado which has steamed veggie, hard boiled egg, tofu with peanut dressing. We saw other customers ordered the Chicken Satay which is chicken on skewers serves with rice and peanut sauce. The only thing that kind of a let down for me is that they don't open for dinner for now. Lunch only from Monday-Saturday. Closed at 4 pm everyday and all day on Sunday. I wish they will be open for dinner pretty soon because I work in the east side, live in the west side and it will be wonderful if I could indulge on Indonesian dinner. Ahhhhh, hopefully it will come true soon."},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent!!!! Restaurant food is outstanding.

Unfortunately we didn't feel it lived up to the hype. I ordered the lobster spaghetti, it was surprisingly bland and had an overpowering flavor of onion ( I easily pulled an amount equaling a half of an onion and left it on a side plate ). The sauce as well as the lobster lacked flavor. Very disappointed considering the 33.00 price tag for the dish. My wife ordered the Cacio e Pepe which seemed very basic. It wasn't anything to write home about, it seemed loaded with butter, not olive oil and didn't impress for the 22.00 price.

We were seated at the sushi bar and a waitress came over and said she would take our order for anything on the front of the menu (drinks, appetizers). Since we were only interested in the back of the menu (the sushi), we didn't know how to order. Finally one of the men behind the sushi bar asked if we wanted anything and then explained you order sushi from there but anything else from your waitress. I thought this was a little bizarre and didn't know who to go to for questions.Second, there were no traditional sushi rolls which I always love, only special rolls. Although their special roll I ordered (Friday the 13th) was one of the best tasting I've ever had, hence the 2 stars instead of 1.Lastly, we asked what a section of the menu was and the guy making sushi quietly explained it to us (I couldn't hear him over the counter at all) and said it was special spices added to the sushi. We figured we'd take a chance and order it, and that it would be enough to fill us since it was around $10. But for TEN DOLLARS we got TWO pieces of SASHIMI each. This absolutely infuriated me and the menu didn't explain this and neither did anyone else in the restaurant. I felt completely ripped off and have never experienced this before!!Overall even though the one special roll we ordered was fantastic, i will NEVER go back here and would never recommend the place. The service was terrible and the food options were overpriced and there wasn't much variety."},{"name":"Texas Roadhouse","address":"1770 Hilliard-Rome Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Paige was very attentive to all our needs.

Therefore, if you want to try more varieties, or don't want to feast, this is the place for you.Disclaimer: this is based in an Uber Eats order.Anyways, I ended up ordering food the Spicy Maki (6 pieces) and some Crab Rangoons (also 6 pieces).Crab Rangoon filling was done right, it had a good amount of meat and flavor! Being a huge fan of these things (and having made them myself) I know getting them right takes armored than cream cheese and crab. They weren't overly greasy, and were fried for just the right amount of time. My only note is the dough was a little flakier, more \\"barnacled\\", and the pressed corners came apart a bit easier than I'm used to.Spicy Tuna Maki was pretty average, but don't take that as a negative, It is not designed to be mind blowing.

The buffalo mozzarella had a nice rich earthy flavor, in contrast with the bland \\"plastic\\" stuff I've had elsewhere. While the cooked basil may have lacked the pop of fresh basil sprinkled on afterward, it still provided that characteristic licorice taste.I had a pistachio cannoli for dessert.

I started with the crispy calimari, which came with chopsticks. Ummm...OK. For my entree, I tried the special of the night, which was boar meat. I asked that it be cooked medium rare, but it came out medium well, and wasn't all that flavorful...almost like a dry pork chop. Maybe that's how boar meat is, I'm not sure, but this certainly didn't leave a lasting impression. Overall, the vibe I get here was really odd. The decor gives off a kinda ski lodge feel. The menu has bratwurst, ropa vieja, and pizza. There are giant beer steins used as decoration. Grilled rice balls, calimari, and Kari Kari dumplings are served with chopsticks and ponzu sauce. It seems as if they are just throwing a bunch of things together that kinda sound good, without an overall vision or style.

When I drove home, after driving 40 miles, I opened up the package containing the brisket and the photo speaks for itself.  This is not extra moist brisket.  I have been to many well known places like Terry Black's and Rudy's in Austin, Coopers in Llano, Louie Mueller's in Taylor, TX, Snow's in Lexington, and Blacks in Lockhart and their brisket was spot on!

They had me at eggplant for this one. This dish is not marked as vegetarian, but it is, and you can double check with the server. The menu listed tomato sauce, which sounded boring, so I asked the waitress to try to amp it up, and they did. The dish I was served was rich and flavorful, maybe even with a HINT of sweetness, but I didn't mind. My guess is that they added some cream to the dish so that the sauce would not be too tomato-y.

This changes my perception of the Omni brand moving forward.  BAD move on their part and I won't forget next time I plan a trip.The rest of our stay was OK.  Water never got much better.  Don't stay on a top floor, maybe it is better on the lower floors.I would give this 1 star but my family overall had a good time despite the lackluster lodging so Omni gets the benefit this time with 2 stars.  Halo effect of other things I guess....."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"IF and only IF you sign up on the Yelp waitlist prior to coming, this will be a terrific experience. I was actually on the hunt for the best salmon croquettes and stumbled across Atlanta Breakfast Club. Thank God I saw the waitlist option on Yelp. I signed up at home and was told there was a 95 minute wait. No problem, get a nap in and head over to comply with the \\"Check-in by this time\\" requirement. We were running 10 minutes late but a quick call to the hostess and all is good she informs.When we arrived, the place was a mad max house of folks outside and inside waiting to be seated. My boyfriend dropped me off at the front and headed to find parking (there's a lot right in the rear of the building - circle the block). I gently tread through the tight crowd to the hostess and perfectly timed, my name was next to be seated! I felt a bit guilty with the large hoard waiting but immensely thankful I'd seen the waitlist option on Yelp. I know I've mentioned this a few times now but you will thank me if you decide to go here.I was thinking it was going to be an eternity to get my order and thankfully the Yelp reviews/pics had helped me decide what I wanted before arriving. When the waiter came to cover his favorite items, my pre-selected option was his #1 recommendation (SHRIMP & GRITS). I ordered that & added cheese plus a single side of salmon croquette ($6 alone for 1). My man ordered the peach cobbler french toast and a side of scrambled eggs with cheese. We both ordered Arnold Palmers. The food arrived in 20 minutes or so but it was hard watching all the deliciousness come out ahead of our orders. I have a list to try next: chicken & egg biscuits with gravy looked divine, homemade cinnamon rolls were a head turner, chicken & waffles were very popular, pancakes were huge and there were many more. Now to our food, the shrimp & grits were the best I have ever had - I was so happy I ordered them. Succulently covered with shrimp gravy that had marinated all morning with a loaded topping of shrimp and cheese...one word - DIVINE! Every bite was better than the last and coupled with the salmon croquette, this brunch was a taste of heaven. The salmon croquettes were not like my granny's or the best I've had but they were tasty. My boyfriend's peach cobbler French toast was good as well but I was so not paying attention to him because my food was far better, IMO.This restaurant is truly a well oiled machine when it comes to the kind & helpful staff, seating, explaining the menu options, taking orders, delivering orders, cleaning the tables, providing to-go boxes and completing the checkout process once you are done eating. We tried our best to get right out because there was still what seemed like an endless sea of people waiting to be seated.We really enjoyed our waiter and many other restaurant staff that came by just to say hello or share a helpful experience in the last two years of the restaurant's opening. I anticipate returning back here to enjoy additional menu items...though it will be very difficult after what hails as the best shrimp and grits this side of heaven!!!!"},{"name":"Golden China Express","address":"3636 Main St","city":"Hilliard","stars":"4","text":"I had the Pad Thai with chicken.It had too much heat and virtually no flavor.It had slices of green Chili's in it, which I've never seen in Pad Thai at any of the other dozen or so restaurants where I've had it.I won't be going back."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"We recently had our son's rehearsal dinner at The Salt Lick and could not have asked for a better experience!

The bar was somewhat crowded, but there weren't many people getting food. The atmosphere is nice, though still relaxed. The art on the wall is by local artists and you can purchase it if you like. I wasn't really a fan of our corner's artist...First off: the beer. I had two beers, the Mighty Aphrodite Imperial White and the Shakti Saison. They were both excellent. Each came out at an appropriate temperature in a high-grav tulip glass. Very, very good, though I feel like some extra carbonation would have helped. The mouthfeel was just a bit too watery for my taste.We ordered fried crab fingers, white pizza, lamb tenderloin, and flourless chocolate cake for dessert. I didn't have any crab fingers... The pizza was good, though not spectacular. The lamb was very good. The cake was amazing, though for $7 I would have liked a bigger portion... or at least more than a teeny bit of ice cream. Overall, I was very happy with the food and ecstatic with the beer.I'd go again for sure, but probably for beer and a snack. The full dinner was pretty pricey.I should mention they also do beer dinners. There was a sign up for a 7-course, $65 marathon of food. It looked fabulous. While I don't really see myself going for one, it does look like 5 Seasons really brings a classy brewpub to the Alpharetta area.

The small menu of pies may not boast the seemingly limitless topping combinations and varieties that other, more modern pizzerias do, but the pizzaiolos here have truly mastered the art of Neopolitan pizza crust. The large rounds are rimmed with the ideal amount of char. A bite of the crust initially crackles and then yields to a soft yet chewy, tangy crumb. The crust rarely gets soggy and holds the weight of the toppings and sauce quite well. I have tried three varieties of pizza here thus far and have enjoyed the piquant diavola and veggie forward verdura the most. Pies run $20-25 which may seem steep, but note that they can feed two people.Parking has never been an issue for me as there are small lots across the street and directly behind the restaurant. Additionally, I have always gotten takeout from here but eating in involves counter service and ostensibly limited space, so prepare for that if you're coming with a group. Antico has consistently satisfied my appetite and lived up to the hype due to exemplary crusts. Do note that if you're a topping kind of person like my fiance, Antico may not be your absolute favorite as they do not allow for custom pies or topping subs. Nonetheless, a visit to this Atlanta institution is a must for any fan of pizza."},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"7880 Winter Garden Vineland Rd","city":"Windermere","stars":"2.5","text":"Been stuck in this drive thru for an hour now.

It was filled to the brim with a generous variety of meaty toppings, and when paired with arugula... Well, let's just say this pizza was crafted for me. There was a literal perfect amount of the Pale Ale Caramel on top that gave the pizza a hint of sweetness without being overpowering. I really wish it was more than just me dining here, since if I were with a second person it would have been perfect to share a charcuterie board plus the pizza I had. I barely made it through the pizza by myself, and honestly forced myself to finish it because I couldn't stand to waste it and have no way of taking and storing leftovers in my hotel room.My server, Carlos, was also ridiculously attentive for me just being a single diner all by my lonesome. I swear he knew my water glass was empty before I did, and he was always around to refill it (despite it being unnecessary and unexpected, it was greatly appreciated).When they drop off your check they drop it off in a tiny notebook filled with past visitors' signatures and notes and drawings.

I think I spent too much time taking a photo so I'm not sure if it was meant to be crispier, but I really enjoyed it. It doesn't have the depth of fancier chicken and waffles, but it's pretty solid! The peach cobbler was also a hit for those sweet tooths - ABC is not a place for anyone watching their carb count haha.Overall, super friendly service and great food.

Portland/metro is usually pretty on-point with its Asian cuisine, and you can usually expect a certain standard of cost and quality across the board whether it's Thai, Viet, Japanese, etc. This did not meet those standards.I ordered a pork bowl with yakisoba noodles instead of rice. It came with a green salad and some dressing. The pork was pretty fatty, and honestly a couple of pieces looked exactly like bacon. My noodles had been hacked up, as if they were being served to a child or something. Like, when in the heck does anyone ever chop anyone's noodles up?? They were approximately 2 inches long when my plate arrived in front of me... A little graveyard of yakisoba bones on my plate. :( I will say that the miso soup was just fine, and pretty average. I downed the whole bowl. All in, I paid just shy of $11 for miso and weird bacon-y chopped-yaki-noodles with a side of bland-sauced-iceberg-lettuce. I was not thrilled. We didn't finish our dinners, nor did we ask for to-go boxes.The place was fairly empty as a few other Yelpers noted. -I glanced at yelp reviews after we sat down, but before our food arrived.

As a broke college student spending $35 for minimal food seemed preposterous, and to frame the review it was. Even though I have a full time job now, it didn't live up to the hype.My friend decided she wanted to go here for her birthday dinner. I was excited cause like I mentioned, I've been waiting to try this place for a while. I tried to book a reservation online but to my dismay they only take reservations for lunch and for dinner ONLY if you're a party of 6+. I imagined this place to be PACKED cause it's a hot destination.To my surprise, I was sat right away! There's also outdoor seating which will def be nicer for later in the summer when it's warmer. The hostess was very sweet, attentive, and efficient. We were sat in the back at the high top tables. I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. Me and my friend were very appreciative of the high ceilings and the vibes. It reminded me a bit of San Francisco and I loved it. The design of the place is very cool and modern! I geeked out a little bit over the bathroom cause it was beautiful. Definitely had to take pictures.Our server was very informative and helpful, for it was my first time eating here. I was looking forward to order the pre-set/made boards but I came to learn that those boards are only available for lunch. For dinner, we chose 2 meats and 2 cheeses. We got the Proscuitto di Parma and the Salami. For the cheeses, we got Brie and I forgot the name of the second one, but it was a hard cheese.Okay, to be honest this was my first time at a restaurant/establishment like this that serves food/boards like this so I admit I'm not well-versed in this. However, my inner frugal self could NOT get over how small the cheese was and the prices they charge you for it? The meat, I get. But the cheese. I don't know, it didn't sit well with either me or my friend. We were also given 4 pieces of crostini (bread). This was sooooo fucking good omg. The bread was so fresh and buttery and perfect.We ordered a side of fig jam and the board came with pickles, olives, and some mustard.The crostini-to-meat-ratio was a bit off but my friend and I assumed that they would charge us if we asked for more bread. BUT! To our surprise, our server offered more bread that was even more fresh... and we got 6 more pieces! It was so GODDAMN GOOD.Besides the board, we also ordered the garlic knots and the mushroom pizza. The garlic knots were warm and buttery, definitely recommend. As for the pizza? DO NOT ORDER THE PIZZA, or at least the mushroom pizza. First of all, the pizza took forever. Okay, I get it. That's one of the few things on the menu that requires warming up/heat so I get that that takes a while but I kid you not the pizza took 20+ minutes to get to us. Good thing we got the knots and the board before then or else you would've had some hangry customers, for real.The pizza needs its own paragraph. It was fresh, sure but it was lacking in the sauce. We got lost in the sauce cause there was BARELY any. The toppings were also sparse? Wish there were more mushrooms and Italian sausage. The saving grace of the entire pizza was the crust/bread and that's saying a lot because I usually leave the crust for last, depending how full I am. Overall, the pizza was not worth 15 bucks. Your 15 bucks will go further if you order other things besides the pizza.One thing that's cool about this place is that they give you your own water jug. I always appreciate restaurants that do this because it saves you the trouble of flagging down your server just for water when they have other tables to attend to. But it's kind of annoying how they feel the need to keep refilling your water glasses for you. I know it's incorporated in their service/training but it's quite annoying, especially when you're trying to have a conversation with your friend. It was busy and I get it, but my friend was in a rush to leave cause she had to prep for her flight the next morning and it took 20+ minute for us to get our bill.I found out, however, through my friend who went for lunch that that is a completely different experience. Sounds like a cheaper deal AND you can make reservations so if I HAD to go back, it would only be during lunch.

Oh, ok. Side eye.Because they didn't really have anything we wanted, two of us decided on dessert. They only had the fried cheesecake, and our waitress (who was very nice) informed us that because it was made to order that it would be about 25 minutes to come out. Ok, no problem I guess. However when it did come out, I had to wonder why it wasn't hot. The middle was cold and the pastry crust was barely warm like it had been sitting on the counter for a while. Meh.We also ordered a hookah. Everything about it was sub-par, unfortunately, and for $32 I at least expect a quality smoke session. Combine that with the fact that it took the young man who was in charge of the hookah well over an hour to give us new coal... that's just unacceptable.Lastly, don't volunteer to sit on the patio in the evenings.

However, there was a \\"punch\\" available that was almost like a pre-cocktail, so I went with that. They called it the Burning Bush, and it had bright citrus flavors.food\\n+ RAGOUT, locally foraged mushrooms & forked potatoes: This is a great starter with a fresh farm egg, Brussels sprouts, and other light greens. \\n+ PORK THREE WAYS: There are three cuts of pork with a spice crusted rib, pork belly, and sausage. This is a great way to try pork in a way you have never had before! I personally love small plates of food to try as much as I can, so having three different types of cuts and flavorings was just what I wanted. \\n+ LOCAL SWORDFISH: The swordfish was already cut and plated so that putting your knife into the fish broke it apart.

He's a Mixteca fan and nearly licked his plate clean. I found the mole negro to be somewhat flat and one-dimensional, and the tortilla and chicken to be a bit dry.

On the day I visited this restaurant, there were 13 parties in front of me before I was seated so, I assume this place gets lots of business.  However, the parking lot in the back was nowhere near adequate for the influx of people this business appears (based on the day I went) to receive.

The teppanyaki was decent - chicken was great, but beef was just not or me - tasted almost like... lamb. But the teppanyaki was on the more oily side. Avocado smoothie - amazing.

The service, which would have saved this review, was extremely polite but slow and forgetful (2 reminders for the sake and 3 times for a salad fork).Chirashi was uninspiring and bland tasting. While the fish was very fresh (probably the only saving grace), the selection was boring with the hamachi being from a very veiny cut. Two generous pieces of fresh toro were there to justify the $21 dish. The sushi rice, an integral part of the chirashi bowl, was hard and sticky; sorely lacking the consistency and umami that makes the dish whole. Adding some ikura or even masago would greatly enhance the colors and cover up the bland tasting presentation.The California rolls, which took some time to make, were loosely wrapped in soggy sushi rice (perhaps from a different batch?), and equally unenticing. Such a simple staple dish of the North American sushi industry, and a safe favorite of the kids, should not be so butchered.The Miso soup was OK, but one can't help but wonder which mass-produced package it came from.

This truck is hard to catch, especially for a student who lives on campus, so make sure to check the website and call ahead of time just in case! They usually are open during lunch (11:30-1:30ish), but are in north Austin--too far of a drive for a UT student like me. Other times, they are open in downtown for late night snackies. Catching them for dinner is difficult. I ended up being lucky today! They were open from 5p-8p near the Triangle. Woohoo!I tried a bite or two of almost all the burgers, so here's what I think:1. Po-Ku: I was excited to feast on some yummy pork belly. First bite was creamy, meaty, and satisfying. After the first bite...not so much. The pork belly was dry and the patty was a little dry too. Thank goodness for the sauce, or I would have been very sad.2. Chicken Katsu: Chicken has good texture in the breading, also slightly dry on the inside. Strange citrus flavor in the coleslaw was unexpected and not that tasty. My friend who got this sandwich was not very satisfied.3. JapaJam: If I come back, I would probably order this next time. The egg is definitely a good touch. This burger was full of flavor and cheesy, eggy goodness.4. Oishii: Much lighter than expected. Also one of the better choices, IMO. Mickey D's Filet-O-Fish got nothin' on this sandwich. I would expect a fish sandwich to be rubbery and bland, but the fish in the Oishii had great flavor even inside the fried outside coat. Yummy, creamy texture.5. Bacon Jam Fries (not on the menu!) - This was one of the new menu items that they had at the Draught House. Bacon was surprisingly SWEET (I guess that's why it's bacon JAM...) but very, very tasty. I could lick that bacon jam off a table. Fries were a little oversalted and got soggy quickly. Pretty good though when fresh and hot. Overall, the burgers look small, but are extremely filling and flavorful. They are $6 even, including tax, which is an extremely reasonable price. Wish the pork belly had been a little more tender, but judging from the other reviews, they usually cook it well.

They handed us the drink menu on a clipboard and I kid you not it was 10 pages back to back of different beers... I've never seen anything like it. The boyfriend and I ordered 3 beers to share and they were all unique and very very good.Our server was absolutely fantastic very friendly and welcoming and took his time to go over the menu with us and make suggestions. We started with the Mac & Cheese and the arugula salad and both were very good. The cheese on the Mac & Cheese was unlike any I've had, it wasn't your typical cheddar cheese it was a combination of cheeses and you could really taste the difference it was so good. I ended up ordering the ravioli special which was pretty good but the star was definitely the half pound cheeseburger my boyfriend ordered. The bacon was the best I've ever had... it was thick, kind of smokey, and full of flavor so good. The burger meat was also so very good, definitely really good quality meat and nothing beats a really big juicy burger. Loved the herb and garlic Belgian fries that came with the burger, so good and they went so well with the burger. Absolutely one of the best burgers we've ever had definitely recommend it as my favorite there. We were getting so full at this point but the food was so good... we had to try desert and as full as we were we ended up eating each delicious bite. We ordered the blackberry pie and it you can tell it was definitely home made. The berries were fresh and mix of sweet and sour and instead of having a crust the pie had a couple of biscuits on the warm berries and they went so well together, definitely an interesting take on your typical pie very well done...If you're in the area check this place out because their food was some of the best we have ever had, so good, we will definitely be coming back!"},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the quintessential Orlando chain hell experience.

The rice was substitute with orzo, so more like a pasta. Nevertheless, I did enjoy their version. It's a completely different dish, but they did a great job mixing the flavors. The chorizo has a little kick to it and goes well with the tomato & cucumber side, which taste refreshing. I like the fried egg to be over easy, and it goes well with the orzo.

Our go-to dish to order at breakfast places would be an Irish benedict (benedict with corned beef hash). It wasn't on the menu but I asked the waitress if it was possible, she just nodded yes and wrote down the two orders. She did not tell us that there was going to be an extra charge to get corned beef hash - didn't find out until the end where she wrote $10 extra charge. Honestly, if we had known, we wouldn't have ordered it with our benedicts because it came out a little soggy, we honestly would have just ordered a side of corned beef hash in hopes of it being more crispy. The taste of everything was normal, it wasn't amazing so we'd probably stick to the other two diners since it can save us that extra charge no soggy corned beef hash. As for service, the \\"host\\" literally didn't even say anything to us when we walked in even though he was standing right by the door folding up napkins and forks. A hello to seem welcoming wouldn't hurt or just to simply say out loud that we can sit anywhere we like. He then proceeds to hand us the menus very unprofessionally and was not very greeting.

We said we'd like cocktails. When I questioned the Tuesday special for appetizers I was told I had an older menu and they didn't offer that anymore. Ordered appetizer. Maybe 10 minutes later the appetizer arrived... Still no drinks or plates napkins or silverware which we has to ask for.

Ever.  It was only my second visit to the restaurant, and I was excited to explore the menu a little more this time around.  Let me start by saying that the food and service were both incredible - I feel compelled to write this positive review because there was literally nothing that could have been better about the meal.Food:We started with the smashed cucumbers, lobster shumai, pork and scallion wontons, and Chinese broccoli.  I won't go into detail on all dishes, but they were all wonderful.  The beer selection was also solid - they have a good variety and some relatively niche stuff, IPAs to stouts.  In our next round, we got kung pao mushrooms, pork ribs, octopus, and dan dan noodles.  The ribs were to die for - falling off the bone, flavorful but not slathered, and incredibly tender -- the mushrooms were substantive and flavorful, yet the preparation and presentation was minimalist, and the octopus was thinly sliced and had a nice texture to it.  It was also complemented by the spice of the chile.  The dan dan noodles were delicious, but make for a very unique tasting experience, be warned.  The oil they are in nearly numbs your mouth -- it tingles and has this almost-spicy effect that you can't quite put your finger on, but it makes you want to keep eating more.  It's kind of bizarre, but is honestly worth ordering for the experience.  I would eat the noodles toward the end of the meal (as we did) because you need to take 10 minutes or so to let the feeling subside.Drinks/Dessert:Throughout the meal, we had a few drinks -- IPAs, darker ales, a delicious chocolate stout, and the homemade buttered rum (which was just so indulgently good).  We then finished our meal with a dessert - THE COOKIE.  Talk about simplicity done to perfection -- that is the cookie.  Served in a ~8\\" pan straight out of the oven is a perfectly baked, gooey, melty, amazing chocolate chip cookie, with one scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce on top... It's ridiculous.  The ice cream melts slowly on top of the warm cookie, and makes for one of the best share-able (indulgent) desserts I have ever had.Service:Our server was also insanely helpful over the entire course of our time there, with well-spoken recommendations every step of the way (upon request), and a genuine enthusiasm for the restaurant.  Chef Tsai was also there, and seemed to be enjoying the Saturday night scene with his colleagues, which added to the familiar and welcoming feel of the restaurant.Overall:The bottom line is that the entire meal was amazing.  Nothing was overwhelmed with sauce, nothing was cooked to less than perfection, and the variety of dishes allowed for an exploratory eating experience.  The ambiance is also great - very warm and cozy, but not close-quarters.  It is casual, but the food and service is of such quality that it can be anything from low-key dinner with a close friend all the way to a savvy date choice for someone you want to impress.If you are worried about the wait, put your name in about 60-90 minutes ahead of time, then go to Drink and have a great cocktail or two before making your way back to Blue Dragon -- it's a good combo."},{"name":"B Cafe","address":"405 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"While the food is good, the service is pretty terrible.

They saw me waiting and it wasn't until I came up to the counter to ask about my meal, after seeing several bags sitting there for so long while people came to pick up their to go orders, that anyone bothered to tell me it was sitting there getting cold. \\nI just found this most recent exchange to be incredibly unthoughtful and rude.

Right at the entrance, patrons may peer into the open-kitchen concept, already lined with plates of burgers by the restaurant's opening. In the bar area, lights are dimmed and framed posters decorate every square foot of the grey wall. The L-shaped dark-wood bar is complemented by wood bar chairs, and a number of hightop tables, each covered by spotless white tablecloths, are dispersed around the space. Let me cut to the chase -- I made the reservation weeks in advance, I showed up to the quiet Cambridge streets 20 minutes before the restaurant even opened, just to order one thing on the menu: the burger. Right at 5:30, the line stretching around the corner was ushered in, and the first patrons were all asked if they would like to reserve a burger. My partner and I each ordered one. It would be an understatement to say that I was skeptical: how good could a normal burger possibly be? It would take a few minutes to find out.  Before we could indulge, our waiter carried out a large breadbasket, as well as a pumpkin hummus with thin sesame crackers. The bread was nothing special -- a formality to whet my already voracious appetite. The hummus, served with balsamic and pomegranate, was a nice amuse-bouche -- I found myself shoveling the dip onto the bread once the crackers were gobbled up. And then, the main act. Each of the 18 burgers was brought out to the bar in procession, and a piping hot plate was placed before me. The burger was complemented by a salad and hearty steak fries, as well as a compartment plate of some tangy notes including red wine vinegar pickles, mace ketchup, and celery root slaw. The first bite, I had to convince myself I wasn't biting into filet mignon -- the burger, prepared medium-rare, was that buttery. The sandwich held up surprisingly well, standing up to the juicy burger and dollop of sauce. The fries were all-stars, well-salted with a perfectly crispy outside. My only gripe was that I was taken aback by the saltiness of the salad -- something lighter with fresher flavors could have provided a nice balance to the rich meal. For $80 after drinks, tax, and tip, my partner and I left beyond content. I was surprisingly full with just the burger, sans formal appetizers.

Since the server goofed and didn't realize our table was in her section she comped us an appetizer (which she really didn't need to, as we were talking and not really noticing that we hadn't gotten served yet, haha) and we chose this yummy artichoke / marinara / cheese dip that came with little crostinis that I didn't need because I was happy to just eat the dip with a spoon.  It was almost like veggie lasagna made with artichokes. Yum!  For pizza I ordered the ambassador bridge which was frequently recommended on Yelp and it was very good.  They use a great quality sausage and pepperoni, smooth and creamy ricotta, and very flavorful sauce and cheese.  The crust, though thick, was very light and airy (I usually prefer thin crust but this thick one didn't bother me).  I have had pizza in Detroit though so I knew what to expect and this was definitely a great example of Detroit pizza.  I really want to try the thin crust next time since that's more my thing, one nice thing they do is you can get the specialty pizzas as either style of pizza, or you can do two different specialties half and half on either style (you can't do half one style and half the other... that would be logistically problematic, yo...)They have a full bar with lots of options, and they use Maine Root ginger beer which I love, and they have cans of Vernors which, though I can get much cheaper at the grocery stores that carry it, it is just cool to drink Detroit soda with Detroit pizza (and Vernor's is better than any of the other ginger ales IMO, it is smoother and sweeter.)

With the park hopper pass and early entrance ticket, you have great opportunities to visit the parks quickly and easily. You can certainly do a park each day, but we found a 1/2-3/4 of a day is more than enough. It was great to find a balance of fun rides in each park, so I didn't feel like wasted time in one over the other. Diagon Alley is definitely more magical and head and shoulders over Hogsmeade though.

This place has an amazingly streamlined system for serving huge amounts of people some serious barbecue. The property is expansive with tons of areas to sit while you wait for your table. We visited on a Sunday night and there was about a 30-40 minute wait. The restaurant does not serve alcohol but you can BYO or buy wine at their onsite winery, that you can drink while you wait and bring to your table. The courtyards to wait are beautiful, decorated with fountains and Edison lighting. A random cat may stop to say hello.Once seated at one of many huge dining halls, at a large picnic table, the service was very quick. The friendly server was helpful and swift. The menu has family style options and pick what combo of meats that you want dinners for individual dinners. All dinners come with baked beans, cole slaw and potato salad, no substitutions! The sides were all good but nothing that knocked my socks off. The turkey was tender and perfectly smoked without tasting like smoke. The pulled pork was also really good. They offer two options of barbecue sauce, regular and spicy. The regular was a vinegar/mustard style which wasn't very sweet. They had a few dessert options, that we did not try but looked amazing. All of the menu besides the bread and desserts is gluten free! They have obviously been doing this a long time and they stick to a simple menu.

Non-vegetarians will likely recognize some of their favourite New England oysters on the raw bar menu. Island Creek oysters, a sister company, has some of the best oysters I've ever tried. And don't miss out on the cocktail shrimp, they've become my standard for other restaurants. Overall, the raw bar items are priced reasonably for the area and similar restaurants around Boston. As for the lobster rolls, both the warm and cold are delicious. If you're on a date and can't choose between them, order one of each and split.

I loved the little piggy touches of decor and the open kitchen space. We came for Sunday brunch and had a lovely meal that included highlights like THE best corned beef hash and homemade donut with confiture de lait (aka caramel sauce). The boy had the $29 prix fixe course, which was a good deal considering that it includes coffee/tea, starter, your choice of entree and dessert. We share the homemade donut as starter and it was incredible--crisp, sugared outside with a soft, cake-y inside.  Topped with a sweet caramel sauce, this was like warm bites of HEAVEN. The boy's entree was the corned beef hash. It was really rich with great meat and potatoes flavor enhanced by a farm fresh egg and a judicious amount of creamy hollandaise sauce. I had the sausages with biscuits and gravy and while it was good, I thought it was lacking a certain richness. The biscuit was slightly tough and--dare I say it?--perhaps could've used a touch more butter. The sausages were great though.We ended our meal with delicate profiteroles filled with calamintha (a mint-like herb) ice cream, covered in bittersweet chocolate sauce. Soooo good. The pastry was supremely light and crisp. Profiteroles are usually not my favorite dessert, but the combination of the herbed ice cream and perfect pastry shell made them stand out.And on a note unrelated to the delicious food, I admire Craigie on Main for being a family-run business operating on a core set of principles that allows them to be a successful and responsible member of the community. In our checkbook, I saw that they outlined these principles in detail and explained their passion for local and seasonal ingredients. I think it only adds to their charm.

I am unable to believe I am saying this, but this Kerbey is terrible. Maybe it's because they are new and haven't found heir stride. I have tried this location 3 times. I sat at the bar the first two and went for a table for two the last time. The secret to this location is to order tacos and a cold beverage. Because you will not get silverware even once your food arrives, and if you get any hot drinks like coffee you have nothing to mix a simple sugar with. The waiters are very slow. It took us like 20 minutes for our waiters to come back when we made the mistake of saying we weren't ready to order yet. I even saw one waitress scoff at her manager because he asked her to help some other customers at the bar. Right in front of the customers how rude! The food is terrible too hence the taco suggestion. I ordered the French toast and got burned and stale bread, what a joke. I tried to get the Kerbey scramble, I mean how do you screw up an egg and vegetables? The answer is you don't put eggs in it because what I got was potatoes and tomatoes. I asked for ham to be mixed in and when there was none, I asked the waitress to send it back and sure enough she said there is ham in it and like a search and rescue team she found one piece which actually happened to be a chunk of bacon not even my ham and was disagreeable when I asked to have it remade.

And the food is where all the effort goes. I ordered the combo plate with sausage, ribs, and moist brisket. According to our Texan friends, MOIST is the way to go. And so it was--tender, fatty, and delicious. The plates also come with potato salad, beans, coleslaw, and bread, so really, unless you are the type that can put away plates and plates of food, the buffet option for $20 isn't even necessary.

I can't give them less cuz I have nothing to kvetch about. We ate there during 'Spring Break at the Hall of the Rat King' (aka March @ Disney). They seated us promptly (a loaves-and-fishes miracle in Orlando). The food/setting/service are impeccable (we're pretty 'pecc'-y).We had several Andean drinks that need descriptors. Inka Kola Golden is an offensively-cheery concoction like liquid Bazooka gum & banana candy; yum! Chicha Morada, a treat my brother adores, is a bit like A&W with grape candies & a touch of coffee or chocolate. I think it's vile but the rest of the table oh'ed & ah'ed. The sangria is impressive & the Pony Malta... words fail me. Think of unfermented beer (ick) made with molasses (yuck) then stuck on a shelf for several centuries - but in a good way! I can neither explain nor defend the fact that I love it. Libations came with a plate of thin tostones, smooshed plantains fried in a way that made them both crispy & toothsome-tender which should be impossible... or at least illegal. The sauces that accompanied them made it mind-blowing. First is a green, silky, sneaky-hot sauce that gave me the kind of eye-pop I had the first time I ate \\"Japanese guacamole\\" but with a capsaicin spike that wasabi lacks. The heat is the kind that thrills without punishing your taste buds. Still, be warned: this is not for the faint of palate. I approached the white one with trepidation, but found it bright, creamy, sharp, vaguely citrusy... & utterly addictive. It became the \\"Yeah, but try it with the white $%&@ on it!\\" It enhanced every dish.We shared 2 of their specialties, Rotisserie Chicken & Chaufa Rice (Peruvian version of oriental fried rice) & 2 that should be, Churrasco & Corvina Fish. Each flavour is simple, thoughtful & spot-on. I had skirt steak, Churrasco a la Planca, a dish that you can find everywhere south of Guatemala. I forgot just how thin they cut skirt & ordered it medium rare. It is fantastic with amazing flavours but would have benefited from medium - skirt needs more Maillard-reaction char. The chimichurri is the best I've ever tasted. Simply magnificent & magnificently simple.I do not care for Chaufa Rice; it is too... everything. The sesame flavour is intoxicating but the umami packs a punch. Mom raved about it & mourned the fact that the huge portion went to waste (doggie-bags & hotels don't mix well). I don't eat fish, but the piscivores went ape-poo over the Corvina's perfectly-prepared, buttery tenderness. My husband had Rotisserie Chicken. I mocked his lack of adventurousness... until it arrived. OMG! Chicken. Flames. Turning spit. I neither know nor care how they infused it with angel's tears & forbidden magic. In my youth, Dad made grilled chicken with a secret butter-and-don't-ask baste that is a treasured memory. He is weeping in heaven now that I've tried the chicken at Pio Pio. Sorry, Dad!Sides: My only real complaint is that the frijoles (beans) are less seasoned than I expected, the only nod I saw to American palates, but it doesn't detract from the meal. The rice is perfection; not the grainy, plasticky \\"rice\\" you normally find but a dome of lightly-enhanced, tender & sticky rice. Some got cassava (a delicacy that I consider tapioca that just didn't try hard enough) but the star is maduros, ripe, kinda-sweet plantains caramelised to perfection. They are magical. What confused me is that every single side went seamlessly with each entr√©e. That should not be possible. Desserts: Pio Pio squeaked by on this one. The Tres Leches & Cr√©me Brulee are a good end to a meal but not special. are we disappointed with them? No. are we surprised that they did not knock us for a loop? Actually, yeah. After a meal of revelations, a \\"pretty good\\" dessert is a let-down. We had two special members of our party. One uses a rollator (walker) & I'm too large for booths. The hostess took a moment to size us up (literally & figuratively) before giving us a table that left the very-large me comfortable but out of the way, and everyone had plenty of room. The waiter is instantly-attentive without hovering. Whenever we *thought* we might want something, he is THERE.Cost: The price for this meal was, frankly, ludicrous. It is the best dinner of our Orlando adventure but you'll spent more at Chick-Fil-A. I tipped generously out of guilt over \\"robbing\\" the restaurant! Did they not get the memo? This is Orlando; you overcharge for mediocrity & demand a king's ransom for anything special. We live an hour away. This is our 1st visit to Pio Pio & will NOT be our last. We drove over there for Tibby's (a space-time portal to classic NOLA) until they built one in Brandon. There is no doubt that we'll be driving over for this Andean delight.

We chose the front room at a two top near the window, which was a perfect spot for people watching, and lent lovely natural light to our meal.I didn't know they had happy hour specials, but they do, from 5-6, which was a great surprise (it requires the purchase of at least one drink in order to take advantage of the food). I so appreciate that they only use sustainably caught seafood. The entire menu is filled with truly delicious sounding items, and prices are reasonable. I struggled not to go overboard ordering one of everything, but ended up with the following:MOXO Potatoes - A small portion of baby crispy potatoes, in a mildly spicy sauceOctopus Yakumi-Amazingly tender, best octopus everrrrr. Loved the smoky flavor and paper thin grape slices. Not only delicious, but stunningly presented.Oysters at a Bonfire - Texture was great, flavor was mild, and the selected accompaniments complimented without detracting from the oysters.Daily hand roll - This is a steal at $3 for happy hour, and while simple with just rice, tuna, and cucumber, it was darn tasty - improved only by a few dabs of wasabi. Also, I sometimes find dry seaweed too strong, but theirs was great.Tamago Yakumi - This was the only thing that fell flat for me. I thought it would be amazing because I adore tamago, and I adore chocolate, but the two combined, while not bad, weren't particularly good. It was prepared well, and I can accept that this may just be one of those times something simply does not agree with my tastes.My husband ordered the Vegas roll and Happiness sake flight. I tried the roll, which was a tad oily to me, but I don't like fried rolls anyways. The flight was generous in size, and I only had a sip of each sake variety, but all were very good.Our server was friendly, while allowing us space. After all my worry, the restaurant was not too busy, but it would be loud when full, as I'm sure it is on the weekends and later in the evenings on weekdays. Parking sucks, but that's most of Portland, so just allow a little extra time for that. If you join Bamboo's email list they will send you a coupon for 15% your first visit. Lastly, they are located right next door to Salt and Straw, so make sure to leave a little room for dessert!"},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Horrible hostess, very rude blonde, worst service in the city, too noisy too.

In my latest visit, I learned that Ichiro had an owner change and u definitely saw a menu change as well. Don't get me wrong, the change is a positive one because there were many new creative dishes!\\n_\\nWe ordered the sushi and sashimi boat, Ichiro Super Don, Lobster roll. I have to say, the PRESENTATION was amazing!! I don't usually order a boat but the fresh assorted sashimi and along with very adorable ball shaped sushi made it difficult to not order again. Of course, I wasn't disappointed at all because it satisfied my craving for fresh fish. I believe the selection changes depending on the season but your usual cuts like Salmon and Tuna will be there.The Ichiro Super Don was another meaty and excellent dish. The chicken kaarage and tempura were crispy while the unagi was sticky, delicious. The Wagyu beef was thinly sliced and very tender. I recommend this dish for sharing if someone in your party needs a bit more food to feel full.The next dish which was an absolute show stopper, was the gigantic lobster roll. They tempura battered the lobster claw so it was great to have a chunk of lobster meat to chew on. The roll itself reminded me of a rainbow roll  and it was difficult to differentiate the lobster meat in the roll. However, taste and flavour was great with the ingredients being fresh. Definitely my go to sushi place in Steveston! Also, their desserts like the black sesame Japanese cheesecake is a winner.

The pita for the gyro was very light and the ingredients were very fresh and the feta cheese topped it off nicely. There was a delicious hot sauce the had that I dipped my fries in. Not sure what it was called, but if you like a little spice I recommend it. My favorite part was the Baklava, which I also tried for the first time. It was flaky, sweet and a great way to end a meal.

Moreover, the staff are all very friendly and more than happy to talk about the different meats and cheeses on the menu. My boyfriend and I ended up ordering a charcuterie board with the Chef's Choice meat and cheese with the Shallot Marmalade. I was a little concerned that it wouldn't be enough food, but what I didn't realize was that the board also comes with pickles, bread and housemade mustard. Once I loaded everything onto the bread, it was much more substantial then I expected. For two people, this was the perfect appetizer! Since we weren't expecting to be very full from the charcuterie board, we also ordered the Polpette and the Salty Pig pizza as mains. I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes and marinara sauce, but the tomato in the Polpette dish was absolutely incredible. The meatballs themselves were also very flavourful and a generous size given the price of the dish. Last but not least, the pizza. Wow. If you (like me) wanted to try as many meats as possible without ordering all of them on a charcuterie board, then the Salty Pig pizza is for you. It had at least 3 different meats, which paired perfectly with the sweet pale ale caramel sauce that was drizzled over it. However, one of my favourite aspects of the pizza was the un-traditional mustard sauce that was used as a base for the pizza.The Salty Pig is hands down one of my favourite restaurants in Boston.

The potato salad and coleslaw you get as sides are also fingerlickin good. Located a little bit outside of Austin, Salt Lick is truly a must go when you're in the area.

There wasn't even a sign stating they were only doing Chef's Whim, but, I did like Chef's Whim there when I'd been. I miss the pencil and paper they gave you to write down your courses though. If you haven't been here before, Chef's Whim is a 4/6 course tasting menu only on Sunday evenings where the chefs decide what to serve you - there seems to be a pre-decided selection for each course as there was some consistency in dishes across tables around us. Off the bat, we didn't have a great first impression back our table was really wonky, and our server had to rejiggle a wedge that was keeping our table straight. The water was also room temperature on a day that had hit high 90s, some ice would've been nice. Bread was room temperature, but the salted butter was delish. The rest of the dinner went much more splendidly. We weren't hungry, so opted for the 4 course.Our amuse bouche was goat cheese, tomatoes, and onions. The next course was mussels with chorizo chunks, puree, and aerated cucumber, followed by a pan-seared monkfish with braised cabbage and iberico ham broth. That iberico ham broth was to die for, I'm salivating thinking about it! It couldn't hold a torch to the next course however - miso-rubbed Wagyu flat iron steak, with maitake (?) mushrooms with cauliflower and herb salad. NOM. Dessert was a chocolate mousse with crushed almonds and pitted cherries. At ~$50 per head for 4 courses, it was a decent amount that didn't leave you stuffed, but rather quite satisfied.

Excited by the pictures he saw online and what he had heard. I had been before and liked the meats, but this time not so much. Brisket: the fat around the brisket that should make \\"the bark,\\" was not rendered, so there was a thick slab of fat that was not the crispy buttery deliciousness that it should be. And because it had not been cooked long enough to melt the fat, the meat was pretty tough. Everyone disliked it, even my 8 year old. Chicken: was not fall-off-the-bone delicious. I had to pry the chewy meat off the bone, again, not cooked enough. Maybe going for lunch is a bad idea, since the food isn't done cooking. Pulled pork: was tasty, but they left gobs of fat with the meat. Sausage: hubby said the sausage was awesome. I thought it good, but pretty average. Pork rib: I loved the pork rib. Not too fatty, actually fully cooked. Sides: other than the fantastic bread, are not recipes that we like, but are okay. Potato salad is served hot. Cole slaw is vinegar and no mayo. The beans are like something out of a can. Their sauce is also not what we are used to, though Texas bbq shouldn't require sauce--they splattered it across our plates.

Took about ten minutes, before we saw our server again and he was not checking on us, but rather walking to another table. He seemed put out that we wanted drink refills--it was 98 degrees today and we had been waiting outside for 45 minutes. He should know that we would need at least one refill.Conclusion? We don't intend to go back, unless a friend really wants to go. I will order the sausage, ribs, devour a ton of bread and save room to try one of their desserts. I will make sure to order a refill, asap"},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"2190 Howland Blvd","city":"Deltona","stars":"2","text":"This is the dirties McDonald's I have ever been in!

These pizzas were huge and we would have been fine with one. These are pricey pizzas so even though we basically wasted an entire pizza it wasn't too bad since we split it three ways. The pizza came out blistering fast. I can't imagine it took more than four minutes for our pizza to arrive. It was so fast I was almost positive it was someone else's order. It was ludicrously hot when it arrived and of course, I didn't wait to bite it. This quickly resulted with me burning the roof of my mouth.

The french toast was a really good deal at something like $3.00 for a fresh springy slice of french toast with real maple syrup and I was able to add smoky bacon for $2. Moving on to baked goods. The muffins were amazing looking and loaded with berries, but I found my blackberry muffin to be a little dry. We also tried the sticky bun. I thought it was alright, but the bf really liked it. Too me it seemed like challah covered in a sauce I didn't like with nuts. Mind you, I had never eaten a sticky bun before so this could be what all sticky buns are like.

I trust the judgment of my fellow Yelpers.There was a strong fishy smell when we walked in. No real biggie because duuuh, sushi. The place is small but has adequate seating & there was only 1 couple there when we arrived (we got there around 4:20ish, they open @ 4pm on Sundays). The waitress brought out the regular & vegetarian menu for us both & I was totally stumped on what to choose because of the number of meatless options. I decided on the Two Roll Combo ($12.99) which comes with Miso Soup & a salad. I went with the Shrimp Tempura Roll & the Spicy Yum Roll.Now, I could've done without the soup & salad (few pieces of iceburg lettuce with a ginger dressing on top).

So of course I checked out Yelp for some direction on where to go.  With all the great reviews on Tandoor, I had to check it out.As previously mentioned, the decor was pretty simple.  I'd say it definitely was clean and spacious, although kind of cold (it was a chilly evening).  I would not call this a hold-in-the-wall establishment.  There was a TV playing Indian videos, which was kind of fun and added a little authentic ambiance to the place.  There are some big tables there, so I think this would be a good place for larger groups.  However, the service was on the slow side.We ordered two dishes, tandoori chicken and aloo gobi -- your basic Indian fare, along with some onion naan.Overall the food was very high quality with good ingredients.  I'd say they had a slightly fresh twist on Indian fare, as it definitely didn't seem quite as oily, as it can sometimes be, and thus not as heavy.  The portions sizes were pretty nice as well. (Except for the naan, they seemed to skimp here and gave you sliced pieces instead of the whole thing like every single other Indian restaurant.  This is so inexpensive to make, not sure why they skimp here.)The one thing sorely missing -- the spice!  Given that I'm an Asian lady, I thought maybe I had some street cred here, and they would know, yes, she likes spicy.  Hmm, not so much.  The spice was lacking big time, and this was a big let down to me and my dining partner (non-Asian).So not sure if the spices were off this evening or if Portlanders perfer more mild Indian fare or what?

There's grayish wood flooring, walls, and tables that all match. There's large TVs hanging up on along every wall in the place.  They kept the small stage in the corner, where they have live music as well as karaoke on Fridays I believe. If you check in on Yelp, you can get 50% off your first draft beer.  They have a good selection of beers on tap, as well as beers in bottles and cans.  As of right now they don't serve liquor, so beer and wine are your only choices. However, it seems like they plan to serve liquor in the future. They do serve food here, however I didn't have any while I was there so I can't comment on the quality.The bar was not very crowded when we were there, and service was not great. We sat at a high top near the bar and saw our waiter only when we were ordering, got our drinks, and needed the check.

What drew me to this restaurant originally was their dessert selection. But what helped me decide to add Pambiche to my Portland itinerary was their large selection of entrees. There aren't too many Cuban restaurants in CA; Porto's is the most known and it doesn't have entrees like Pambiche's on their menu because it's more of a quick pick up deli and bakery. My bf and I decided to split one entree and one dessert since we weren't super hungry and were going to eat an early dinner before leaving Portland. My bf chose the Pescado Con Coco and I was down because steamed fish in a coconut sauce with Cuban beans and rice sounded delicious. And it was! The steamed fish was very tender and the coconut sauce had a prominent coconut flavor (delicious over the rice). The Cuban black beans were super flavorful and on the soupier side which was fine with me. They tasted great on top on the rice too. We subbed for brown rice instead of white rice (additional cost). I highly recommend this dish if you like fish and want something on the lighter side. For dessert, we ordered the Selva Negra which is a chocolate cake with passionfruit cream sandwiched in between the cake layers. Yum! Some people don't think passionfruit and chocolate go well together but I didn't mind it. The cake had chocolate curls on the side and was sprinkled with shaved almonds and chocolate. The whipped cream topping was also light and airy and not thick and overly sweet like other cake frosting tends to be! I would recommend this if you like chocolate and tropical fruit. They also have other desserts like guava cheese strudels, flan, and tres leches. The service was very attentive and our waitress was very friendly. The price was reasonable for the size of the portions and quality of ingredients.

King Bao is in the former location of Raphsodic bakery on Mills near East Colonial.  They offer various beef, seafood and poultry proteins choices including two vegetarian options.  There are several tasty tater tot accompaniments like Truffle Tots or my personal favorite the Fire Tots with a delicious sriracha aioli and fresh jalape√±os. What is most notable is the soft-pillowiness of the steamed bun which is skillfully executed - that along with the thoughtful flavor profiles, kudos to the owner.  They offer combos that include either 2 or 3 baos plus a drink (bottle water or can soda). We both opt'd for for the 3-Bao combo to try the different flavor combinations. We had the Kickin chicken, Glen Rhee marinated Korean short rib, firecracker shrimp and grouper.  I ended up with an extra Bao because they gave me a Hogzilla Pork Belly by mistake.  A great mistake it was - the pork belly ended up being one of my favorites!   We also sampled the Igloo which is a deep fried steam bun stuffed with ice cream and peanuts.  A perfect ending to satisfy my sweet tooth!  There is parking directly on Mills or there is a parking area behind the building.  I'm happy to hear they plan to open late on the weekends, it may give a few other late night spots on Mills a run for their money!  There isn't much seating, so it's better set up for grab & go.  Perhaps the will add some additional tables near the window which may help with the those who do want to hang out, eat & chat.  Good prices, quick quality food!

Whenever I take people to this place, I always recommend doing the family styled order. Unlimited brisket, ribs, and sausage - served with all of the sides. The best part about this is that not everyone at the table HAS to order the unlmited. they will allow for you to order whatever, and just not share food. Another selling point for this location of Salt Lick is that it is BYOB - you can bring whatever drink you want here, and they will let you drink it.

A huge pile of lobster meat cooked perfectly and a nicely toasted buttered bun aren't the only things on this dish.  Well prepared slaw and perfectly light crisp homemade potato chips round it out.  The lettuce cups (3 for $13) featuring crispy fried oysters, pickled veggies and remoulade were just perfect.  We turned down the offer for a 4th and  regretted it!  Pay for the extra lettuce cup so you and your dining partner are still friends after the meal (maybe Row 34 should just make this 4 cups for a couple bucks more and make things easier).  Island Creek Oysters are some of the best around and didn't disappoint.  Their champagne mignonette was great!  The one dish that didn't blow me away was the tuna. The tuna was high quality and cooked just right but had a thick crust with strong seasoning that overpowered the tuna.  With all the other elements on the plate the dish worked as a whole but I wish the tuna had more of a chance to come through.

I've been there for work, for a meeting and I've also been there with friends.

You can order anything from various coffee drinks to breakfast foods, sandwiches, salads and more unusual dishes like Tibetan momos (dumplings) - I've had them and they were quite tasty. Actually, just about anything I've had there has been solid, including their vegan cashew chili. My favorite thing to get there, although simplistic in nature is the deluxe grilled cheese, which is served on toasted challah bread and which comes with tomatoes, provolone and crispy bacon; it's finger-licking-worthy!They have free wireless internet for all to enjoy and you can sit down, kick back and surf away while people watching or just enjoying the quiet atmosphere there.

The toppings did not stand out against the crust even though the crust was thin. In fact all the toppings seemed to taste the same. A result I think of a lack of quantity and doughy crust. Being from NJ I have a high bar for pizza and even in my current Miami residence it's a struggle to find pizza that compares to what I grew up with. The menu is limited as is the wine selections.

We split and loved the pork belly sliders on their soft buns, the pork dumplings were just ok in my opinion but the onion pancake was fantastic and flaky.  We loved both the Mexicano and the Picture Roll.  And, at the urging of most reviews as well as Ronald Cheng hisself, we tried and loved the Shaken Beef.  For those who don't know what that is (we didn't), it's tender chunks of beef in a slightly sweet marinade over a bit of a salad with white rice on the side.  This dish also came with a dipping sauce that just floored us it was so tasty.  In fact we spent about 10 minutes trying to place all the flavors until we asked the chef and were told \\"Lime juice, salt and pepper.\\"  Huhwhut?  I wanted to dip myself in this stuff (which probably would've stung some) and couldn't believe it was something so simple.  In fact, Ronald went on to explain that simplicity in food can bring out the best flavors and is something he strives for here.So, southern friends (ie below the river), if you wanna meet us for dinner, I will be recommending this place to meet halfway.

Okay--it's not *that* long ago, but compared to my recent visits, it's in the past. I have taken seven trips to Walt Disney World in Florida--four times as a family and three as a solo trip during Marathon Weekend. One of my favorite restaurants is Raglan Road (RR) and I have been there at least three times. Luckily, I had some notes from my trips to help trigger my memory. So, we're off to see the wizard...Atmosphere:\\n  \\nRR is a pub, and the inside can be dark, but beautifully elegant. I love the interior, and there is a dome ceiling that is just gorgeous. They have Irish music and dancing in the evenings, so if you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, I suggest you go at lunch or before 6 p.m. The outside patio can be nice as well, but keep in mind, it is Florida! The one thing I didn't like was the small tables being cramped together. My first visit was just the two of us and they sat another couple right beside our table. They weren't busy so it would have been nice to have a little bit of privacy. Other than that, I love the look of RR. *4.5Food:Every morsel that I tried at RR was outstanding. From their amazing Irish Soda Bread with Guinness and Olive Oil, to scrumptious entrees like Bangers and Mash, and topped off with Apple Berry Crumble--all was phenomenal. If you're a Guinness fan like me, it's a treat to get one on tap at the right temperature. I'm dreaming of their food right now, and wish I could be transported to RR. *5Service:Unfortunately, I can't give a full five stars to my beloved RR. On my first visit, the service was wonderful--no problems. My second visit had some hiccups and almost had me not return again, but it's the food! The last and third visit was with a group of running friends and we had a bit of trouble again. I would say they have a bit of a problem with friendliness. It's been a couple of years so hopefully the staff is better now. *3I would highly recommend you visit RR if you get the chance in Downtown Disney; it's usually pretty easy to snatch a reservation. If you don't want a full-on meal or it's too busy, you can check out their quick service restaurant, Cooke's of Dublin, next door. I can't believe I haven't tried their fish 'n chips!

We had arrived about 30 minutes before closing to avoid the crowds and it couldn't have worked out any better as we were seated in less than 10 minutes. It was towards the end of the night and it's almost closing time but to my surprise our waitress was extremely patient and courteous unlike our polar experience the first evening in town at Toro.We had one of the specials of the evening which consist of a trio(mussels, clams and 1/2 a lobster) of seafoods in pasta with a homemade lobster tomato sauce. We also ordered the lobster ravioli in a lobster rose sauce. We also started with the fried calamari as per the recommendations of pretty much everyone! The wines were very affordable and I do encourage you to get a bottle with your meal as it's a perfect accompaniment.Let's start with the good. The homemade lobster sauce is divine. It's a lighter sauce with few hints of herbs however has a nice kick of lobster stock. You can really taste the individual pieces of lobsters in the sauce. I am a strong believer that seafood's should not be paired with a strong, overpowering sauce and I think Giacomo's has done right on this one. The pasta itself is nothing spectacular but it isn't bad. Unfortunately, again we have rather bland tasting seafood (I think it's a theme here in Boston). I am not sure if it's the water or what but seafood here seems to be lacking that briny flavour. I have noticed is that the seafood tends to be silkier and more tender here as well. The lobster also has a much softer shell compared to lobster we get back home which I am not sure why. However, the ultimate downfall of seafood in Boston I think it's the lack of that fishy, briny taste that seafood inherently should have. The sauce for the lobster ravioli again is delicious but the ravioli themselves are okay I would say. I have had better but overall this dish is somewhat delicious. The calamari we started the meal with is very tender and cooked to perfection but again lacking in a bit of flavour.Overall in comparison to my previous experiences in the area I think Giacomo's has done well. With a great combination of excellent service and pretty good food I can see why there is always a constant lineup out the door."},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This was my first time trying Italian food in Boston and wow was I AMAZED!

My friend and I were trying to find a brunch place to go to on a Monday, which is nearly impossible, when we stumbled upon this place. I drive by it all the time but never notice it because it's immediately off the road and it's over shadowed by the building beside it. When we pulled up there wasn't a lot of parking in the front so my friend let me out so I could put our name down on the waiting list. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes for a table which is quite significant because it was 12:30 pm on a Monday, so i can only imagine how long the wait is on the weekend. My friend ended up parking in their back lot, but it is just as equally small as the front lot. You may have to look for adjacent street parking and walk over if both lots are full. When we sat down we were greeted by a bubbly waitress that took her time to go over the menu with us front to back. They are know for their chicken and biscuits and all of the items are made in house. We ordered some peach French toast for the table, which is not pictured because it was quickly devoured, and for my\\nentree I ordered the chicken and biscuit with an egg.

It has been on various lists as the best burger in Boston and has a reputation of something special. Before I get to my food impressions I have to say that the restaurant is nice, stuff is friendly and service is good. Now the burger is $26 and to add bacon it is $3 extra and egg is another $3. Not a cheap burger by any means and you would expect it to be spectacular. They only make 18 burgers a day. It is only available at 5.30 pm. And you have to be there right at opening waiting in line if you want to get one. Lots of hype!The burger comes with the salad, fries, their own ketchup and some kind of their own pickled onion. The fries is disgusting. Salad is bland and soaked in vinegar. Ketchup is bland and un-flavorful. The burger is substantial and fatty. It has good consistency and potential but has some kind a spice added that really spoils the flavor. There is really no need to do that. Quality fresh meat flavor should not be hidden in spices or at least the flavor has to be pleasant which is really not the case here. It was very disappointing considering the hype and the price. I had way better burgers. Considering the price it is just a disgrace. And here is why I am giving them one star. Strictly based on the food I think it is a 3 stars place. But the chef who was running the kitchen was touching and adjusting the food with his hands. He had the gloves on and in the same gloves he used his mobile phone. Then he kept working without changing his gloves. At some point he greeted customers and still did not change his gloves. Unsanitary and gross! One star!"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Salt Lick BBQ is quite literally in the middle of nowhere. If after miles and miles of heading down a pitch-black road through Texas Hill Country you, like me, begin to wonder if your $40 Uber ride is taking you out into the wilderness to kill you and pocket your barbecue money (Salt Lick BBQ is cash-only), fear not. Operation Pork Ribs will be underway soon enough.The Salt Lick, as it's more commonly referenced, was opened in 1967 in Driftwood, TX. It began as a small, modest stand selling barbecue a few times a year, expanding to seven days a week as demand grew. First opened by husband and wife team Thurman and Hisako Roberts, the restaurant has been passed on to the next generation and is now operated by son Scott and his wife, Susan.Today The Salt Lick has expanded into a compound of theme park proportions. It is the antithesis of Franklin BBQ in many ways--plenty of product, acres of space, and you have more than three hours for a shot at eating lunch here. The enormous dining room looks like a campground lodge with it's communal wooden tables and benches, string lights, and dirt parking surface outside. Despite the gargantuan size and off-the-beaten path location, The Salt Lick's reputation precedes it and there is often still a wait to eat.We were able to avoid the wait by visiting late on a Sunday evening, arriving borderline-delirious from thirst and hunger. What you'll be feasting on is on display as soon as you walk in, since the iconic BBQ pit is front and center in the entryway. The open pit's flaming live oak and the links of sausage hanging above are mouthwatering, especially for people in our starved state. This must be delightful to look at and smell when you're stuck waiting two hours for a table.If you love yourself you'll order the pork ribs, spectacularly tender and juicy. Basted with sauce and cooked over direct heat, they have a well-formed crust and a nice chew. The rub is simple--just salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper--applied right before cooking in order to avoid extracting juice and moisture from the meat. Other meats besides the ribs were inconsistent and thus the 4-star rating. The brisket was dry and reliant on the table sauce to make it edible, a no-no when it comes to expected Texas barbecue quality. The sausage, made from a combination of beef and pork, was rubbery and overly salted. The open pit in the doorway, no matter how large and effective as a marketing strategy, can't possibly cook all of the meat this place sells from start to finish. Some investigation around the restaurant will show you that things are smoked in rotisseries in the back, then finished on the open pit while being basted in sauce. According to the restaurant, a normal year will see over a million pounds of brisket sold. Craft barbecue this isn't.Sides of beans, potato salad, and slaw are available as is bread (slices from a sesame seed-topped loaf rather than Wonder Bread) and accoutrements in the way of pickles and raw onions. Potato salad might be a weird thing to rave about, but the version here was pretty great, made with a vinaigrette salad dressing, dill pickle juice, and barbecue sauce. It's then finished off with a light helping of black sesame seeds, thanks to founder Hisako's Hawaiian and Japanese roots.Other locations have opened in recent years, including one in Round Rock, TX just north of the city center as well as an outpost at the Austin airport (DON'T GO THERE). If you live or are staying in downtown Austin your ride to/from The Salt Lick's Driftwood location will likely cost more than your dinner, as it did in our case, otherwise if driving there's plenty of parking in the giant gravel lot. You can feast mightily here for $20 - $30 a head, but just remember that you'll want to stick to the ribs, otherwise you risk disappointment with the other meats."},{"name":"Kyoto Joe's","address":"2050 N Decatur Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"2","text":"Went there only once and tried the lamb & beef gyro.

Their grilled cheese is phenomenal - mostly because it's served on thick challah bread. This is also why I love their French Toast - again, served with the thick, fluffy challah bread. Their French Onion soup was tasty too - not too salty or overpowering like some French Onion soups can be. So if you find yourself on Newbury and looking for a nice little cafe to grab breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner, Trident Cafe has a large menu with lots of options.

We got there at 6pm on a Tuesday and there was already a line out the door.  However, it was less than a 10 minute wait until we were at a table. I didn't like that the restaurant was so crammed that it felt as if we were sharing a table with the people next to us. It was also quite noisy, not good if you're on a first date.I really enjoy that they have the menu written on the wall, but also give you paper menus. The service was very quick and pretty friendly, especially for how busy they were. They give generous portions and the food isn't very expensive.Before you even order they bring you very yummy bread, but no butter to go with it :(. We started off with the calamari for an appetizer. We ordered a small and we even had leftovers. That was by far the best calamari I have had in my life! Amazing!For the rest of the dinner, it was very good, but judging from all of the wonderful reviews on here I was expecting more..I had the lobster ravioli which was very good, and I couldn't even finish it. My boyfriend got the shrimp and scallops over pasta with a spicy lobster red sauce which he gobbled right up.With both entrees and the appetizer, our bill was only $41 which we were both very pleased with. My last complaint.....no dessert menu!? What's that all about?\\nAll in all it was a nice night, great service and yummy food.\\nOh and remember... its CASH ONLY!

We got up early on the second day of our vacation and drove about an hour to Driftwood, arriving just before doors opened at 11.  When we called to ask about the wait, we were advised to come early to beat the church crowd (it was a Sunday), and a 10:50 arrival gave us easy, close parking in the giant lot, and immediate seating once the place opened.  There were only a few other parties arrived by 11, so I guess if you're willing to come early, the famous Salt Lick doesn't even come with much hassle.I hadn't done a lot of research on the place, or even seen it on TV like my dad had.  (He was very pleased with the Salt Lick story on the back of the menu, as he'd been curious why the owner looked Asian.  The answer - he is half Asian.)  I was expecting a big restaurant with a lot of outdoor space, but not quite a giant ranch.  Salt Lick sits on a giant property with several buildings, including its own wine and beer store (the restaurant is BYOB, but you can B your B on the premises).  The restaurant is just one of these spaces, but it's huge, with the homey, jolly, woodsy feel of a summer camp dining hall.  The open kitchen features a lot of busy employees and a big, pretty fire pit, with meat hanging out around its edges.Our family of five sat at a comfortable picnic table fitted with wood benches, and we were helped by an excellent waiter named Cody.  He was incredibly friendly and hospitable, just comfortable and competent and warm and sociable on top.  He helped us put in our order and checked in with us often.The food came out fast, like immediately fast.  We came in at opening, but by the time we settled in and ordered, we saw another table get their food.  I guess all the food is ready to serve when the doors open.The food was delicious.  We had just the kind of barbecue feast I'd envisioned when planning for my first trip to Texas.  Our biggest order was The Rancher plate, which came with small portions of brisket, pork ribs, sausage, and turkey, with sides of potato salad, cole slaw, beans, bread, pickles, and onions.  We supplemented that with the regular baby back ribs, one double cut beef rib, and the habanero chicken.  This was a good amount of food, and we got more variety than we would have with all you can eat family style.My favorite meat on the table was the beef rib, which was inconveniently the most expensive by weight.  It was fantastic, meaty and dripping with flavor, tender and easy to gnaw off the bone.  It was glazed with a sweet barbecue sauce.  The other meats were almost as good.  The brisket was fork tender, the sausage snappy with a lot of smoke.  The half rack of baby back ribs was a porky feast, slathered in dark sweet sauce.  We thought it might be redundant when we were getting the pork rib, but the pink pork rib was a different kind of barbecue, drier and less saucy, but with enough moisture and natural flavor to stand on its own.  The chicken and turkey were as impressive as the cow and the pig.  The habanero chicken was great, a half chicken deeply marinated in a sticky spicy habanero sauce that reached in without overwhelming the juicy mild meat.  The turkey was just plain Thanksgiving turkey, but it was moist and flavorful and well worthwhile.  We ate all our meats with the house sauces, which were mostly on the sweet side.  I would've liked a more punchy, vinegary option, just to have, but I liked the ones we got.I thought the sides at Salt Lick were as good as the barbecue.  In fact, of the big barbecue spots we visited in Austin, I thought the meat was better at Franklin's but the sides much better here.  We had plenty of potato salad, beans, and cole slaw, which came with almost all of our plates, and bread, and pickled jalape√±o, and pickles and onions on top.  The potato salad was some of the best I've ever had, with big creamy chunks of yellow potato without an abundance of mayonnaise.  The cole slaw was crisp and refreshing, perfect with all of the meats, and I loved the pickles and the fat, spicy whole jalape√±o.We were full by dessert, but we shared one bowl of cobbler, split between blackberry and peach, a la mode.  Both were delightful, with real fruit and a pleasant, crunchy butter and sugar crumble.  The fruit was sweeter, with big slices of fruit, and the blackberry was nice and puckery.  The vanilla ice cream rounded it out.I'd love to come to Salt Lick armed with beer for a long dinner.  It looks like you can have wedding receptions here, and it would be a great place to feed a big party.  I loved the food, and the service and atmosphere were just perfect.  It'll be a long time before I make it back to Texas, but when I do, Salt Lick will be right at the top of my list."},{"name":"Universal Orlando Resort","address":"6000 Universal Studios Plz","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Word of warning if you're getting tickets to Halloween Horror Nights and want tickets to the parks beyond that: They offer an \\"Annual Pass\\" that is a bit of a shell game.

He is originally from Japan, but developed a passion for making real pizzas while living and working in Sorrento, Italy (hence the name Pizzeria La Sorrentina).

This place is insanely small, insanely packed, and insanely delicious. On our seafood craze, we had to hit Giacomo's in Little Italy. Although one of my friends was surprised that they have NO MEATBALLS in an Italian restaurant, he was soon compensated by the amazing seafood and side dishes. We ordered the House Special with lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, and pasta. uhhhhh...the menu said that thing was for TWO people. IT IS NOT. It can feed at least 4 people. The lobster is ginormous and sits on top of a bed of mussels, clams, and shrimp...which sat on top of a layer of angel hair pasta. Everything was marinated in an amazing Fri Diavilo sauce. [it isn't spicy, it just has a nice kick]. You must order this dish to share! It is so good! We kept small dishes to put shells in, and the waiter was great at clearing the dishes as soon as they were done to help clear room at the table.Since we THOUGHT the special was for two people, and we had 4...we also ordered the fried calamari and eggplant parmigiana.The calamari was tasty and crunchy. Great appetizer to start off with...if you can handle more food. The eggplant parmagiana was the best I've ever had. It was made perfectly, and the cheese just melts in your mouth. There is no room in the restaurant. You must come dressed to stand outside for at least an hour, no rsvps, and then you must take off everything when you get inside. The tables are small so I recommend just eating straight out of the big plates instead of getting your own small one. You are also likely touching the person behind you or next to you. We got quite a number of exclamations when our special came out. I was so incredibly stuffed, but somehow, we managed to finish off all 3 plates.  I was a little peeved that the server did not warn us about the amounts of food we would get...but we made it our mission to finish everything...and we succeeded nicely I thought.Also, the artwork is fantastic in the restaurant.

The bowl has more colors than a Picasso painting.(I hear the more colorful, the healthier...or something like that). I for one can barely make out one ingredient from the other but it all equates to a delicious explosion of flavor and texture. Even the falafel, which I admittedly am normally not a fan of was tasty.

It appeared to have a good menu and the decor is cool. Our first clue should have been the lack of customers, although we did arrive at approx 6pm on a Monday eve (we were on vacation) - so we gave it a chance. We sat at the bar, as we generally enjoy bar conversation. \\nFirst, the drinks are approx $15 each and nothing fantastic. Honestly mediocre at best and filled with ice. We ordered a couple sushi rolls that were good, not amazing given the prices paid. \\nOur last concern was that there has clearly been recent turnover as the main bartender was training at least 2 new bartenders. The newbies were polite, trying to learn the ways of this place as they asked great questions and took in feedback. The guy training them was condescending, short with them, and clearly unable to delegate many tasks to them as we waited for him to make our drinks because he wouldn't allow them to do it. He barked orders and criticized them in front of our party. At one point he said to one of the new bartenders \\"get your fingers out of the glasses\\" as the new guy lifted the clean glasses from the dishwasher to restock shelves. I appreciate the trainer teaching the importance of cleanliness... but I didn't like his condescending tone to the new guy, and his way of embarrassing him in front of us. \\nI ultimately left angry that we paid a ridiculous amount for mediocre food and a show of one guy belittling his minions. Perhaps he is the reason for the turnover.

A samosa and a burrito aren't even the same shape!Anyway, I eventually got to see it first hand. For those who don't know, it's more like a chick pea patty! Falafel King is located on Winter Street inside the \\"food court\\" of a dingy building next to Game Stop. You will notice during lunch hour that Falafel King has the longest line in the food court, but that line always goes fast.  Once you get to the front where you order your food, they hand you a falafel to munch on while you wait. Why, thank you. Don't mind if I do! I got the King's special, which is basically the wrap with hummus, two falafels and your choice of beef, chicken or lamb kabob. I went with chicken. It has a very simple but satisfying taste. Hummus & falafel's main ingredients are chick peas, which doesn't have a very strong flavor. If that's what you're looking for, you're probably better off at the fast food chinese restaurant in the front. Overall, it was really filling. I had to force myself to eat the last few bites.

But what a cool place to bring some friends visiting in town who want something different that you know will deliver. The prices - you'll have to accept - are high (probably about $2 or $3 on everything.) Beers are $7.50 - so accept that before you go. The extra is for the entertainment.I was pretty impressed with the menu - a nice modern, American take on Irish. The Shepherd's Pie is good, not amazing - but good. The risotto is really good, not amazing - but really good. There was also a really good dip (the Smokie?) with fish, potatoes, cheese, tomatoes with crostini....filling, and probably the hidden gem. Many Guinness and ciders were drank. At $7.50. But there was tons of music, and fiddling, and riverdancing. A good mix of people..old, families, interesting locals. Very solid and attentive service at the bar. Lots of good choices for Irish-esque cocktails.If you are local and want to have a good time, I definitely recommend getting a reservation (we didn't, but we're lazy) if you don't want the hassle that comes with 'that side of town'. But, if you don't - scope the bar watching for people leaving, or buy drinks and make friends with the bartender and ask him to scope some seats for you. Try to save room for the bread pudding. I didn't and I regret that as I write this. It's not somewhere you'd go a lot - it's a themed dinner, without being cheesy.

There are several DRs including outside patio and a large U shape bar where you can get their full menu.

The DRs are fine though, kind of on the upscale quieter side. +    Food is hit-or-miss.  Their pastas and salads have been just okay.  Sometimes, their dishes are over salted.  I'd stick with the seasonal specials.  My faves are elk steaks and butternut squash soup.  They do have a decent wine list too.   Wednesday eves, they offer wine flights and are the breezy kind.

That being said, Whole Heart Provisions has some good qualities about it, but overall the food is over-marinated, over-dressed, and too salty.This is not a traditional vegan spot, as it has influences from Asian, Indian, Mexican, and American foods! You can mix-and-match your base for their signature bowls, so I did a mixture of rice and greens. I have tried the following bowls:VIET: The spicy peanut dressing on this salad is very thick and they put a lot of it into the bowl. The green beans and tomato were so over-marinated, they were practically dripping and left a watery residue when I finished my bowl.  \\nMISO: I do love the sesame crunch in this bowl. The orange miso dressing was more watery, but again, there was too much of it. This bowl has the strongest flavors and leaves your breath smelling like garlic and miso.\\nTAZON: This is like an Asian-Mexican fusion, with pineapple corn salsa and Korean black beans. The corn nuts were a great added crunch to the bowl, but again the bowl got watery near the bottom because of all the marinades and dressing.\\n+ MISSION: This was the lightest tasting of all the bowls! The dressing and sauce was not too heavy and complemented the edamame, brussel sprouts, and eggplant well.\\n~ CRISPY BRUSSELS: The brussel sprouts are crispy and cooked well, but the spicy crema drizzled on this vegetable was way too overpowering. I love brussel sprouts on it's own so this much sauce was really not necessary. Also, at $4.50 for a small side, this was definitely not worth it!Every dish that I have had here leaves my breath smelling very strong. It is apparent that they try to make vegetables more interesting by adding a lot of dressing and cooking the vegetables in lots of different flavors and marinades.

I'm sure you've had that experience.My girlfriend is a vegetarian and on Monday night they have it 6 course tasting menu for $40! I don't think you can really beat that. I had a grilled Bluefish plate, which was excellent. Are two friends who we met also had the vegan tasting menu and it was well received by both of them. They have some inventive drinks and provided a couple of inventive non-alcoholic drinks that weren't on the alcoholic menu. This makes now alcoholics feel special too! Although Forage, the name,  implies that it should be stuff that is foraged from the nature exclusively they don't really do that so you'll be OK if you're an omnivore.

The spring rolls were one of the better versions I've tried.  The noodles were thicker like lo mein, but nicely firm.  They sat in a slightly sweet peanut sauce.  I would have liked the dish to have used a little less sauce with added spiciness, but then the wife wouldn't have been able to eat it.For our entrees we ordered sesame chicken for her and dry fried pig intestines for me.  I had a bite of the sesame chicken which tasted like sesame chicken everywhere else.  The plating was nice and we liked that the broccoli was kept separate and cooked perfectly.  My pig intestines were over crisped.  I like this dish to have a little more chew to go along with crispiness.  The seasoning, however, was spot on.  My mouth was tingling and partially numb from the Sichuan peppercorns.  Adding to that was a decent burn from the abundant dry chilies and jalapenos.  I love this dish and style of cooking because of the intensity and aggressive spices.  It was also a good style contrast to the cold noodle appetizer.  They provided a small complimentary dish of pickled vegetables to eat with our meal.  It consisted of mildly pickled carrots, cabbage (I think), and large cuts of garlic.  The service was above average although the entrees came out a few minutes apart.  The restaurant was clean with a quiet and relaxing vibe.

So we did so and proceeded to get a cocktail at the joint across the street while we waited, to kill time and have me try another place out too. Astoundingly, we got an alert 15 minutes in that our table was ready. Talk about awesome! So we were seated at our table and proceeded to peruse the menu. The atmosphere was great even considering how packed they were. I love the layout and the decor. It felt so upscale and modern. The bar was really awesome looking too. Our server was beyond friendly and did a fantastic job of giving us the rundown of everything and made some great recommendations to try. This being a big wine place, and the fact that I was basically with a sommelier, we had a blast going for different wines. Since this is more of a tapas place, we all decided to go in on this together and choose a bunch of different things for us to try. We went with the shoshito peppers to start off with. Grilled to perfection. They had a nice roast to them on the outside and a little bit of heat on the inside. We all had the pleasure of each happening upon a really spicy one that knocked you in the teeth. We also ordered the Hangar Steak and the Scallops from the menu. That hangar steak is to die for! Literally melts in your mouth with amazing, robust flavors. And those scallops! Seared to perfection. It can be really easy to mess up scallops, but let me tell you, this place has it right! Overall, this was one of the best experiences I had on my trip to Atlanta. Being a native of New Orleans myself, a place known for its food and hospitality, I was impressed with the menu, the entire establishment, the ambiance and the service as a whole. I would absolutely, without a doubt, highly recommend Barcelona to anyone who finds themselves in Atlanta. You won't be disappointed. I already can't wait to go back next time I'm in town.

Scusa! My friend and I ordered the Scamorza appetizer and the Saporita pizza - items recommended by both the Italian friend and our server. The appetizer was delicious! The cheeeeeeese was super soft and gooey - great for spreading on the accompanying grilled bread. Plus the prosciutto was very generous and you really can't go wrong with the classic pairing. The dish also came with some grilled eggplants that were too thinly sliced and too oily for my taste, but I did appreciate the variety in textures + colors. The pizza was underwhelming though. I was expecting more from a place that smelled and looked so authentic, but the pizza was pretty bland and meagerly topped with sausages and broccoli rabe. There were a couple of slices with nothing but cheese on them! And the crust itself was little more than warmed bread.  I personally appreciate a bit of a crunch and toast to my crust, but the crust here was surprisingly soft and disatisfying. I ended up with a plate full of crust because I couldn't bring myself to waste valuable stomach space eating it.

Aside from never accepting payment options they advertise (ahem, Bevo Bucks -- don't judge), they are really slow at handling orders. The second-to-last time I went was during a slow afternoon, and they somehow forgot my order. I ended up waiting another 20 minutes or so after I figured this out before I got my small order of pizza rolls. The last time I went, also during a weekday afternoon, I had to wait almost 40 minutes for a 10\\" personal pizza. The excuse was that they had a large to-go order that had taken precedence. A little absurd if you ask me. What irks me most is that the staff and manager are always seemingly unapologetic, as if demand for their food is inelastic; get a grip.Just because you may find yourself stuck on campus with seemingly few pizza options I do not recommend this place -- I'd much rather walk a few blocks for some good, quick pizza from Hot Slice."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"3519 Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2","text":"THANK YOU Leah and Andrew!!!

The other thing that bothered me was a lack of transparency--when we ordered, a couple of us asked if we could replace things ie. replace bean sprouts (which a la carte are +$1) with wood ear mushrooms (a la carte also $1) and our waitress said yes it was possible so three of us chose to make substitutions with items of the same price.

The place was packed. They only had a couple of tables vacant, that could only mean 1 of 2 things, the food was going to be tasty or it could be a total let down and the cue was just because of people being hyped up over a new establishment. I must say though, the interior quite vibrant and modern compared to what the previous tenants had.I was recommended the Pork Rib Pot Rice Noodle with medium spice. My order came with a generous amount of pork served in bowl which was boiling hot. The beef broth was flavorful, probably from all the meat and bones brewing in the pot for an extensive amount of time. It was however, a little bit too spicy for my liking. The noodles resembled spaghetti, it had am interesting texture, crisp and chewy, sort of al dente. The pork was savory and the vegetable were crunchy and seasoned nicely. I wouldn't mind coming back here and trying other dishes. I seem to have ordered the very basic bowl compared to the people around me.

Also, to be honest this doesn't make it the most comfortable place to HAVE to wait for a table, but it is what it is.) Unfortunately, we were seated at the table closest to the door, and every time it opened we were hit with a blast of freezing cold air...so it wasn't the most comfortable experience, in that respect.Surly Girl reminds me a lot of Tip Top (they were, after all, founded by the same person) - but to be honest I felt that I received better service and food at Tip Top.(To be honest it probably didn't help that they were out of half the beers I tried to order :-/ )I had the Bacon Lover's Grilled Cheese with tomato soup. While both sandwich and soup were tasty, they were barely lukewarm when they arrived at the table. I also tried my friend's Creamy Bleu-and-Bacon pasta (he added chicken to it as well) - that was much more impressive.

The burger was pretty good, not  awesome... the fries were on the soggy side which is never a good thing.  The voodoo fish taco was so underwhelming that I was disappointed. I was excited about the mango salsa but it was very lacking in flavor. The fish is supposed to be fried but it was soft and soggy. The taco basically had one texture and it was not appealing to my taste-buds. The taco brought tortilla chips which are hard to mess up and they were the best thing in the container; even though some salsa would had been great. I had to deconstruct the taco and eat the filling with the chip to get some crunch and be able to eat it.     I'm not a picky eater at all. But, I believe that all food places should always give quality food to their customers. I know it was a slow night because of the weather and they closed in an hour. However, there should be no excuses for our meal to be less in quality that what they give out. This place has good reviews; I'm sure they can give better than what we had.   I might go back...

Our orders are never complicated (ie no subs, adds, just standard bowls) and the printed ticket is attached to the bag. How hard is it to double check? \\n \\nI think one of the biggest detriments is not having a phone or easy way to communicate with the store. For instance, I've been avoiding ordering certain bowls because the broccoli has said (unavailable) for many months now.

I like to visit a place multiple times before writing a review as an experience shouldn't be based on one encounter. The First time I went to Polito's was on the first Saturday they were open and I had 1 of each taco available (which was 4 - Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie). The second time when I went, I was with my brother and we had the Tacos/Quesadilla. The third time was this past Saturday and we ordered the Burritos. Let's talk about service. All three times when I was in their, the staff was friendly and welcoming. At first it was order/pay for your stuff then sit down, but the third time we went it was sit down, order, and then pay afterwards.You may not think this was a big deal, but the first two times when I ordered/paid/grabbed a number for my table it worked alright (The only feedback is that Drinks weren't given until the meal was ready, and I had to ask for hotsauce). The third time however was horrible. Absolutely a train wreck in terms of restaurant service. We ordered our drinks (Brother got a Coffee and I got a Soda) and our food (Both of us Burritos with meat + gauc).My brother got his coffee at about 5 minutes after he ordered it (Which is great). I got my burrito 10 minutes after I ordered it. I was served my meal before my brother's burrito was ready. I took a few bites, and waited for his meal. We waited for 10 minutes. During this time no one stopped and asked me how my Burrito was, nor did I get my drink, or my brother got his burrito. Overall the service was a mess and wasn't there the third time.We got up, I paid for the coffee/barely eaten burrito (See below) and left. I was super disappointed and my brother and I won't be going there again based on this experience. Prices: Let's talk about prices. Their tacos are $3. Their Burrito was like $13 something with all the gauc/meat, and their Quesadilla was about 8. Tacos are decently priced. $3 bucks beats the norm in Vancouver however many taco places has the buy a bunch get it for a reduced price deal. They don't have a 4 for $10 or 5 for $12 deal or anything like that. For what you got in the Quesadilla it felt like it could've been cheaper. It was okay, super cheesy but barely any filling. The burrito was a giant burrito and if it tasted good it would've been worth the $13 bucks. The Food:Tacos: Best thing on this menu. Sadly they only have 4 types of tacos were many places in Vancouver have about 10. They offer chicken, pork, beef, and veggie. Sub-par. The tacos taste great and is the only exceptional thing (besides the greet) about this place. Quesadilla: It was super cheesy, but I've had better elsewhere in Vancouver. I had to ask for hotsauce with my Quesadilla when it was served. It felt like the only filling was cheese it was so cheesy. Burrito: It's a big burrito. Huge burrito. It was dry, tasted like cardboard (Burnt Tortilla Wrap), and was missing my Gauc. It was horrible, I took 2-3 bites out of it, and waited for my brother to get his or for someone to ask how it was. When none of that happen after 10 minutes I got up, paid in full for the burrito and left. I didn't get it wrapped up, it was that bad. Overall:If you just want a few tacos, and I mean like 1-3 tacos then Polito's is good. After ordering 5-6 tacos it can get expensive compared to other places in Vancouver. It's decent place in Coquitlam/Port Coquitlam but if you don't live within a few blocks of it, you can go to other places like Santa Rosa, Tacoreano Fusion, and hell even Taco Del Mar. DLTR: First Trip - Got Tacos, really good! Price was okay. \\nSecond Trip: - Got Tacos, Quesadilla. Price was meh (7 tacos, and Quesadilla)\\nThird Trip: Horrible all around 1 star. Because I average out my reviews, it's a 2 star review and not a 1 star (Which would be because of my third trip)."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"What is all the fuss about people? I'm no stranger to fine dining but I'm sorry, I just don't get it. The menu, I mean. We sat and ate at the bar, and so there was the regular menu and the bar menu to choose from but I was not at all happy with the choices.  Are they trying to be as odd as possible?! Pigs tails, chicken feet, boudin noir, smelts, tongue, sea urchin, fish with collar bones, bone marrow, pork jowl, squid, sea urchin. It's showoffy, crossing the line into unappetizing. How about some fillet of... anything?! More vegetables and salads? There was no balance in the menu. I ordered a perfectly cooked, smallish and overpriced burger (given the room/rent they are likely paying) and I was not impressed. Sadly, the Vt beef was pretty tasteless. The side of sweet potato sticks were so julienned they were hard to eat. Galette, meh. Asian fish bar item was tasty and had amazing sauce but lose the bone in thing, it's unnecessary. Bread was outstanding.We had a great Pino Nero and did not partake in the eclectic mixed drinks, but I was impressed with the offerings. It looked like an apothecary behind that bar, with the droppers of this, little bottles of that. They also have various shaped ice cubes for different drinks - right on top of the current local bar trend.\\n \\nI was impressed with the professional and efficient staff, at the door and especially Tom at the bar - wow, was he perfect. While we stood waiting for seats, he walked out from behind the bar to pour our wine. Throughout the meal, he was unbelievably attentive. I was so impressed.Bottom line, I know the chef has accolades and it's got to be for a reason. I guess I'll return in Spring or Summer to see if things have lightened up and balanced out a bit.

We had made reservations earlier in the week and our arrival was expected and we were flawlessly lead from stand to table and seated.  \\nWhen I come to a restaurant that is supposed to be finer dining I expect cretin things. The first: that the server be professional, knowledgeable, and helpful.  That's all. Not my buddy or a cheerleader.  Ours came very close to being both which was a running distraction through the meal.  Second, the environment. Over ambitious bussers and whiney servers did that one in for us.Appetizers and Drinks\\nWe had a bottle of white.After the wine I moved on to Ice Tea and the Boys moved to Long Islands.  We had to ask the server between apps. So I took points off for not being offered anything more than water and wine. (Or was I not aware Jesus was in the bar this evening?)Appetizers: Large Sampler of Oysters.\\nThis was delicious.  Four of the featured Oysters came from Prince Edward Island!Wellfleet, Nova Scotia Canada:  My second favorite of the evening.  It's a narrow oyster and the meet is a bit thicker, the salty liquor was superb, you can really taste the difference.Pine Island, Long Island Sound, Conn., USA:  My favorite of the evening.  These particular oysters where much more circular than the rest on the tray with lighter meat.  They had a unique and salty taste of ocean and iron.  Escargot:  Was baked in garlic herb butter and Parmesan.  Each bite was tasty the Parmesan though is covering the dish and there is much more than can be placed on the four pieces of toast provided.  I enjoyed experiencing this dish, but have had escargot done much more agreeably.  The actual escargot was a bit well-done and with all of the garlic herb and cheese you really lost the earthy taste of the snail.  So this dish was a mixed bag. I would go as far as to say sub-par.Entrees:\\nAtlantic Salmon Stuffed with Texas Blue Crab, Bay Shrimp, and Brie Cheese.This was my dish and I really did enjoy it for the most part.  The salmon was prepared perfectly to medium rare.  The flesh was a very light pink.  The salty flesh along with the Crab and Brie created a smooth and strong bite.  I could taste each of the separate ingredients and I really did enjoy how consistent the entire dish was.  My disappointments with this dish.  \\nOn top of the Brie, crab, and shrimp encircle by salmon a type of butter lemon sauce was drizzled over.  It was nearly tragic.  With the Lemon sauce there was just too much pop.  Without sauce the dish was subtle and light the bites with sauce turned into a lemony fish which went weirdly Asian.Oven Roasted Flounder and Stuffed with Lump Crab and Topped with an Imperial Sauce.Birthday Boys order.  From all indications he really did enjoy the meal and this is from a person who is not a fan of food in general. The dish came with a side of the house spaetzle, which they ran out of and substituted with macaroni.  The running out cost them points, but the sauce that covered the macaroni was a highlight of the evening and everyone enjoyed more than a spoonful, and because of the misstep was taken off the ticket.Perfect Filet & Crab Combination 6 oz. Filet with King Crab sections.  Medium rare filet and was well seasoned. I remember thinking that first.  The next was that it was good but not melt in my mouth good.  Observed and was told by the person eating that the crab was a bit overcooked.Desert:\\nDesert was a surprise and was the star of the evening.  A Belgian chocolate tea cup, a white champagne chocolate mousse filled the cup which had Strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and cherries. This heaven was topped with whipped cream and raspberry sauce and topped with a birthday candle. The mouse was fantastic as it hit my tongue I could feel the fizzy from the Champaign and the richness of the chocolate.  Each different berry brought a variation to the taste of the dish that really made me pause.\\nAfter the mousse had been scooped up we destroyed the chocolate cup. Divine.I ordered coffee and just wanted to note that real cream was brought to the table which I always find to be a treat.  The coffee was decent.  The issue for this point in the evening was that it took me asking the manager to get a second cup. I see so many great reviews for M&S but I'm just not convinced yet. I really would like to go back and check out Happy Hour and the Fish and Chips.  Quality seafood that just needs to be accompanied by superb service.

How? Adding Cilantro to a dish does not make it Cuban.My wife is Cuban and I am Puerto Rican, we both lived in Miami for many many years, and we are very knowledgeable about Cuban food.  I assure you that if this restaurant were in Miami, the locals would be lined up outside, with machete's and torches, demanding the destruction of this Cuban-Stein abomination. The cooks were Mexican and our server was an ill-informed Dominican, who spoke with the arrogance of Don Quixote, as he insisted that what he brought to our table was undoubtedly Cuban, although it was barely Cuban-ish. The food was not, as my Cuban mother in-law would say, \\"incomible\\", but it was not delectable, or  spectacular, as the high prices imply they should be. My \\"arrozz con pollo\\" was a soggy mess; a scoop of water saturated rice that may have been regurgitated by some south-American bird (thus denoting it as Latin-esque)  with a sub-par under-seasoned chicken leg quarter (or perhaps it was the very leg and thigh cut from that poor malnourished South American bird that chucked up my rice) draped over the top, sprinkle the entire dish with cold peas, and voil√†, but don't forget the cilantro. Customarily, if executed correctly, tostones (fried un-ripeded plantains) are soft and meaty on the inside and crispy on the outside, similar to a thick natural-cut French fry, Cubans offer a side of Mojo (a dipping sauce made of olive oil, minced garlic, a squeeze of fresh lime juice and a pinch of salt, mashed together with a mortar and pestle) along with it. What I received, were over-cooked discs that should have been marketed as tools for removing plaque from teeth, and some kind of sauce that had the taste of old bitter refrigerated store-bought lemon juice, The mojo lacked the distinctly delicious hint of EVOO and that wonderfully lively bite of \\"Gahhhhhlic\\". The Black beans vaguely tasted Cuban-like and were bland and metallic, I would not be surprised to find a dumpster full of Bushes brand already seasoned black beans out back, the only thing fresh tasting about the beans was the additional cilantro that the cooks wanted to add to it. the yucca was fried with a nice crispy outer shell and soft and meaty potato-like interior (How I wished the tostones would have been), but they were not made in the tradition of Cuban cooking. Cubans style Yucca is  boiled, then saut√©ed with onion and olive oil. Pambiche's preparation of Yucca is as Cuban as the kitchen staff, and...the only place in Miami you can find \\"deep fried yucca\\" is at \\"Pollo Tropical\\" the \\"Taco Bell\\" of Cuban food, and believe me, in the end of that eating experience, I would have gladly prefered the \\"Numero cinco\\" from Pollo Tropical."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"An Austin institution.

Please don't get scared by the seaweed noodles, they aren't literal strands of seaweed that they call noodles. They're also not so infused that the pasta is dark green. There are little flecks of seaweed in the pasta ribbons, the flavor is light and airy and not overbearing. The best part about this dish (mix it up well) was that each bite was a little different from the first. My first bite had hints of ginger and crab. The second bite had hints of crab with the warm and earthy creme fraiche. The ingredients in this dish made sense but adding the creme fraiche was unique and not a normal pairing. It elevated it to another level, this dish was cleaned off in an instant. Each bite showed flavor innovation and restraint. It was glorious. Our next favorite:\\nShort rib, pho spice rib, herb tabbouleh, cured yolk, charred cipollini.Lets start with the short rib, it was sliced thin and seasoned beautifully, perfect for bite sized pieces. The star anise came through in a subtle yet really tasty way. The cook was a perfect medium rare. Having the well seasoned short rib meant that this dish needed something to cut through it, which is where the herb tabbouleh came in. The dressing had some great acidity to keep this dish not feeling too heavy. The cured yolk, well let's be honest, almost everything is better with yolk mixed in. I'm also a sucker for charred onions (cipollini). This dish used strong flavors in a delicate way, making a normally simple rice and meat dish into something surprising and exciting. We tried their fried chicken that everyone raves about, it was good but just good. The sauce was very strong, a bit of a sensory overload that took over any actual chicken flavor. While it was good, it's not something we'd order again here over the rest of their items.Ambience and music is A+."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm from south Florida,  I know what Cuban food tastes like.

We go there about 2 times a month and often take guests. We have recommended it to countless people. So it is with great sadness we can no longer recommend it. My wife organized a birthday dinner for me with our family for their chefs table. She confirmed it with our favorite server who also manages occasionally the day prior. When we arrived the room was occupied and the very unapologetic hostess said they had reserved it weeks ago. They had set up another table for us elsewhere in the restaurant so they knew we were coming. Our server they said was not working that night despite him telling us he would be serving us the day before. We asked for another server who we like who was there but they said he was working a different area and could not serve us. The server we did get disappeared for long periods and at one point my son in law had to ask other servers to find her.\\nAt no time did the hostess or manager come by to check on us or give an adequate explanation for what really happened. I suspect someone \\"more important \\" came in and they bumped us out of the room. They did reduce the bill but it did not make up for the poor service.

The vibe is festive and fun, and Daniel (one of the hardworking owners of this growing chain) was incredibly friendly and welcoming.Started off with chips that were hot, crispy, and delicious. We had the California burrito with mole sauce which was both sweet and spicy. The chimichanga had a cheese sauce that was rich and tasty. For dessert we split the Impossible Cake, which may be my new favorite dessert: flan on top and sweet chocolate cake on the bottom.So many creative dishes on the menu, from the Mexican Street Corn to the Tres Leches.

I thought that if there was ever another issue, it would be good to have all the work done at the same place for records. When I walked in today to ask about a tune-up, they seemed pleasant.... until I asked if he would check the computer to see past work that had been done.  He rudely looked at me and asked, \\"Why?\\"  I told him that I didn't remember the last tune-up being that expensive.  He then proceeded to rudely tell me that it's probably cheaper somewhere else.  So I gathered my things and headed for the front door.  When I was walking by the front desk, I stopped to ask if they were able to check the computer to see past work I've had done.  The guy was very friendly and had no problem doing so.  He then told me that the ONLY thing that was in their system was when I had the fenders put on.  I about soiled myself right there!  These guys basically rebuilt my bike and I've had breaks replaced and tune-ups.  They definitely need a better system of keeping track of things and they need to REtrain their employees on proper costumer service.... especially with long time costumers.

The new offerings were also full of color and smell. Ever had sumac? Note to self: Get the lentil salad with a citrus dressing and sumac. Sampled, and tasted amazing. However, this new second location has a few extras, space being #1. The white walls, black accents, and wood was great. Plenty of tables to eat, a comfy couch to relax with one of their homemade vegan cookies. Small bar seating by the coffee makings, just another great spot to do some work. And, when the weather's nice, customers will be all over that spacious front patio, no doubts.I've been jonesing on the sweet potato & black bean offering, as well as their Israeli couscous one. They are delicious, best part being nutritious, too. Double bonus points!**Side bar: There vegan chocolate chip cookies? Well, if your worried they might taste like cardboard-meets-kitty-litter, you are oh-so-very wrong, and probably should just start reprimanding yourself, now, for not snagging one of these beauties!

She called the Far West Store and they apparently told her they received a call from someone saying they wanted to change the order to pick up?  Not sure what happened, but that call never came from me.  I live alone and no one else would have called on my behalf.  Clearly someone there made mistake and  didn't want to own up to it.Regardless, my complaint has nothing to do with the inconvenience, with the sweet girl Gracie that promised to compensate me for the order, but rather with her supervisor to whom I was transferred.  After a mistake that was CLEARLY their fault, he said, \\"I understand there was some 'confusion' with your order?\\"  No supervisor, there was no \\"confusion\\".  Your staff made a mistake.  All he told me was that they could either deliver me the old pizza that had been sitting there for 40 minutes or make me a new pizza and deliver it another 20-30 minutes later.  Not wanting (and frankly too tired) to be a squeaky wheel and demand some compensation for the inconvenience I passive-aggressively said that I didn't want to wait an additional 30 minutes for a pizza I'd already waited an hour for.  He quickly offered to cancel my order, let me go, and lost a sale and a loyal customer.  I am so sick and tired of crappy customer service.

Seriously. From what I could see, all that was nearby was some fields. And a couple wineries down the road. Far down the road. Driftwood, TX appears to be mostly comprised of The Salt Lick! Haha! No, I'm sure there's more, but there's really not much around the actual venue. Especially if you are a city person like me and expect everything to be packed close together. But it's not too far outside of Austin and worth the drive. It's pretty hard to miss this place if you get going down the right road. The property is HUGE to say the least. Parking was easy and they have a giant lot to accompany the giant restaurant. Service: So you check in at one desk outside when you arrive and they give you pager. There will be a wait. There always appeared to be a wait. BUT, it's never very long since the place is so big! Of course, the larger the party the longer the wait, but they have giant tables inside so I think they can accommodate those people a little easier than other venues probably could. There is a giant patio outside where you can wait. You can also make the short walk over to the wine tasting room/beer booth to get some alcohol while you wait or for dinner. One of the weirdest things to me as a non-Texan, was that this place was a BYOB place. People were bringing COOLERs from their cars with beer, wine, alcohol, etc. as they do NOT serve any in the restaurant. No charge from the restaurant. INTERESTING. Anyway, once you get called back with the pager (15-20 minutes for us), you check in at another booth where they take you inside to your table. Our waitress showed up within 5 minutes, took drink orders and took our food order within 10. Food came out FAST and our drinks were never empty. No complaints. Oh, but don't forget this place is CASH ONLY. There is an ATM there if you really need it. Food: Ah the food. The drive to the Salt Lick was definitely worth it. That giant BBQ pit inside the door was impressive enough, but to know that it actually produces kick a$$ BBQ is awesome. We got combo plates to try as much of the meats as possible. Pork ribs, brisket, turkey and sausage. It comes with beans, \\"potato salad\\", fresh bread. All of the meat was DELICIOUS. I was slightly apprehensive about the turkey, but it was moist and flavorful! The rib meat literally fell off the bone. The brisket fell apart without a knife. And the sausage had nice \\"snap\\" in the casing and an interesting slow heat to it. The \\"potato salad\\" was really more of a hot, vinegary smashed potato. I don't think there was anything else in it other than that! Simple and delicious. Beans were okay - maybe our least favorite part of the meal - but still good. The bread tasted fresh and home made. Overall: WORTH IT. If you are in Austin or the surrounding area, make the drive to Driftwood. You won't regret it."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ok, it's apparent the food is excellent and definitely a 5-STARS. Besides asking for bread/oil a few times, the service was to par and handle our table of 10 very well. Back to the food, I ordered:- Scallops a la Plancha (w celery root, golden rasin, capers): It's funny as I am writing this now I don't remember the capers in the dish but the scallops were cooked to perfection. I mean, I couldn't ask for more. The ingredients meld really well and it was delicious. I would get this again and again. I don't remember this previously included on my last visit, so I am assuming it is a new addition. \\n- Spicy Eggplant Caponata (w basil and sweet peper): This was why I was slightly upset there was no bread on the table. I had a taste but it needed the warm fresh out the oven bread to be complete. Highly recommended for vegetarians!\\n- choriso w sweet & sour figs: This is one of my favorite that I always get when I am here. It has not been removed from the menu since my last visit in May 2015 so I'm guessing it is here to stay until further changes to the menu. Highly recommended for meat-lovers!\\n- Black Truffle risotto: This dish came out last, at which point I was filled to the brim. I had a few bites and took the rest to-go. It was soooo rich, creamy, and heavy. Was it good? Yes. Would I get it again? Honestly, no. \\n- To Drink? Barcelona Gin & Tonic, a must and favorite.

I had to ask her to take it back,tell me what the dressings were that I wanted them on the  side and no cheese. Her response although sweet and accommodating she first had to tell me that is their automatic way of doing things. Really why have different dressings if you are not gonna ask? I had chick parm sand for lunch extra sauce with the chicken noodle soup I had to pay $1 extra for. The soup was funky tasting and salty and the sandwich had a little sauce on the tiniest piece of chicken. I got more sauce brought over and changed to the minestrone soup. At least the soup was now edible but nothing I would ever want the recipe for. The sauce was bitter and acidic without any italian flavorings. Rather than send it back I decide to take home the huge piece of chibatta bread with the lost piece of chicken inside and fix the sauce at home. The rolls that were served at the table were not like I remembered them. Not sweet and yeasty and cold. What happened to that good recipe and the fun of the fresh piping hot roll right from the oven. This was hardly worth eating and I didnt even finish one whereas I used to put down at least 2-3. Now I understand why so many have closed recently. To tell you the truth the reason I went was because I was given their dough cash to replace a poor meal that was for take out. On that meal the lettuce was mushy and rusty and the only sauce was on the chicken parm when it was baked..seems they for there was pasta on the plate as well and didnt want to sauce that. Do they have a problem thinking their sauce is gold that they dont want to let you have any or is it that they know its not good and they avoid using it.

Also enjoyed the POG (pineapple orange guava) juice. The only complaint I have is that their tofu is simply cold, raw chopped tofu. No marinade, seasoning, or cooking. Maybe this is to imitate the raw seafood that's usually in a poke box? Not sure, but raw tofu is definitely not my favorite thing, and I usually love tofu.

The free salad and bread were awesome though I had to ask twice for a single refill on the bread which was only delivered as I was bagging up my food to leave. The waitress didnt box my food for me (which I think they used to do) but that's totally fine -- they were really busy.We did witness the manager basically gossiping and chewing out another staff member for leaving early. She was talking to a waiter while bussing a table and the manager was telling the waiter that some other staff member wasn't supposed to leave, etc. etc. and they were stressed about it. Not even 30 seconds later, this waiter literally told every other staff member in his presence about the gossip he and his manager shared.

I had not been in some time and remember a sign, new management or new owner some months back so gave it a try.   I asked the waiter which of the lunch menu items was the best. He gave me 2 options, and I took the basil chicken which was one of his options.   I also ordered the NON FRIED rolls, the ones made from a vietnamese tapioca wrapper.   The rolls arrived all sliced up on a dish. Some call that poor mans sushi, as it looks like sushi. The lettuce was bitter and contents were minimal. In my opinion you should get the roll whole and then dip it into a sauce, usually peanut sauce. My guess is that they serve them this way to hide a less skilled roll maker in the kitchen. Its not easy to get this right. I know I have tried many times, with various degrees of success. When you cut off the ends it is easier to hide a less than perfect roll. It did have a sauce served with it but it was minimal and of poor quality.    The basil chicken was ok but no better than average at best.  When the server left the food I was slow to notice that there was no spice options of any kind on any of the tables. In Thailand ALWAYS and here most Thai places have a one handle multi spice holder of some make that has sauces, vinegars, chilis etc you doctor up your dish with. Not here. Table are barren.  I get up and eyeball the other tables, ah there is one only, in front of another diner. The waiter went and got it when I was able to catch his eye.   A plus here is the suggested tip guide at the bottom of the bill. I dont normally use those as most take the total of everything including tip nowdays and take percentage of all of it. It should be total before tax and that is what they use on theirs so thats one plus here.  The one waiter also did a good job keeping up with everyone.

I couldn't tell you which one is on which corner.Although I like the old buildings and the patios... a patio on a place I don't like,.. not great plus Yaletown should be carless,.. what is the point of making pedestrians squeeze onto these tiny sidewalks for the handful of parking spots here.  The city needs to grow a pair and force the carless matter,.. people will figure out how awesome it would be even if they are ignorant to that fact currently.Meet IS a place I like the food and it is a great space.  I had an \\"Beyond Meet\\" schnitzel that was probably not healthy,. but tasted as good as any meat based one I've ever had.  I haven't tried the patio but I like the location as it looks toward the open square as opposed to shops. While we are talking about location,.. this place holds one of the best IMO in all of Yaletown.  Steps away from Mobi bikeshare AND the Canada Line station,. plus the other main assets of Yaletown are quite nearby such as Mister (best ice cream in the city), and the Roundhouse Community Centre... and the seawall.I think because I like the food and staff,..

I call, and immediately an employee answers and asks me to hold. Okay, that's fine. 5 minutes go by on hold and I think there must be a mistake, so I hang up and call back. The same girl answers and asks me to hold again. TEN MINUTES later I finally get her on the phone to place my order. Ten full minutes. It takes approximately 30 seconds for me to order and the girl tell me it will be 25 minutes. Okay, I'm not happy about being on hold for 15 minutes, but maybe they're really busy. I get there almost immediately because I had already been on the phone for 15. Whole. Minutes. There is not one single customer in the place! Not one! The girl with the brown curly hair is laughing and chatting with the kitchen, it looks like one of the chefs is eating. But that place is a ghost town. I cannot imagine a situation that would justify having there be not one single customer in the place, and yet I'm neglected waiting on the line for 15 full minutes just to place a to-go order. At this point, if I had not just walked the 25 minutes to the place I would have left without paying or picking up my order. And I had to use the restroom. The girl tells me it will be 7 more minutes (!) so I ask to use the restroom. There's someone in there. I wait 8 minutes to use the restroom. While I'm standing there I notice there's two bathrooms, one that says employees only. It's vacant. I'm like dancing at this point and I'm considering just going into the employee restroom. Finally. The person emerged. And it's a freaking employee! With his apron on and everything! I know that that is not proper food handling practice. I left in disgust. So now I'm stuck with a mediocre and probably dirty pizza. This place clearly can't operate in any sort of way that meet the needs of the apparently few customers it has.

Our meals, in terms of plating and taste, were five star. My only complaint, with the crab Benedict with the harissa hollandaise, was that it was probably first out, and it was cold. The Bloody Mary was very tasty, but chunky horseradish and large bits of cracked pepper were a chewy sip. Not a fan. The Boxty, Ireland's answer to the breakfast sandwich, in this case, and the savory crepes were both excellent!  I hear that the bread pudding is their OMG must-have, but we were all stuffed.

I preferred the cranberry tart square over the blueberry macarons because it had a great balance between savory and sweet flavors.I would definitely recommend coming to the bar, which has a vibrant beautiful setting, over the dining area, which was rather empty and dull.

I've had this exact meal at least twice before and have been pleased, but this time, it was a major disappointment. For starters, the soup was watered down... literally. It was thin and watery, as though they ran out of soup and decided to add water to stretch it out. Only this was beginning of lunch shift, so there's no excuse for that. Whatever the reason, it was nothing like they have served me in the past. Normally, it is thick and full of flavor.As for my Cuban sandwich, it came MICROWAVED. Yes, nuked... unreal! How do I know? Well, it came to my table soggy underneath like it had been steamed instead of crunchy from the sandwich press. Also, it was sitting in liquid, presumably the juices from the pork that escaped during \\"cooking\\". Five minutes later while working on the second half of the sandwich, the bread become hard and chewy, which is exactly what microwaved bread turns into.

The server was very attentive, polite, and competent. My rating is based on that horrible excuse of a Cuban sandwich and the water-stretched soup.

I've been to many pizza spots (deep dish from Chicago and New York pizza from NYC, etc) and this place is just as great! My friend and I drove by this place during a weekend for dinner and the entire spot was packed. You'll find people standing around outside socializing and a packed house inside. You'll find plenty of residential parking in front of the restaurant. This place allows for BYOB, which is great! It was entertaining seeing what other people brought to their tables (beer, spirits, and/or wine)! My friend and I split the Margarita pizza (plenty for 2 people). It was amazing and highly recommended! The dough was hot, crispy, but yet doughy in the middle. The sauce was savory, yet not overpowering. The pizza overall was a hit! I am not local to Atlanta, but if I am back in the city, I would love to come back and other pizzas. My friend and I did not bring a drink, so we ended up buying one of their house wine, each bottle was $25. That's pretty overpriced, but you get what you need in times of desperation. Their white wine was just average. After you've placed your order, they will give you a number and drop it off at your table. They will walk around with the pizza over their head and yell out your number, so pay attention! After you've placed your order, you fight your way through the dining area to find a seat. Seating can be difficult, it is a first come first serve environment. There are many tables laid out across the dining area, so at times, you will be sitting right next to a stranger. Warning, the dining area is really hot! Make sense, they are cooking the pizzas in the same room. So don't dress in layers because you are going to boil. On the left side of the room, there is a sink. At first glance, you'd think it's for washing your hands. However, you'll find plastic cups...for customers to pour themselves a cup of tap water, sadly. On the right side of the room, you will the employees working away preparing our pizzas! Also, the condiments are right at that station. I recommend the minced garlic, it is a great add to the pizzas! You'll find many other condiments such as crushed peppers, parmesan, etc.Overall, this is a great place to stop by if you're looking for great pizza in Atlanta!"},{"name":"Straits","address":"793 Juniper St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"As I sit across two men in town on business - one, a mover and shaker from the suburbs of NYC and the other, a sophisticated West Indian brother and dear friend from the opposite corner of the country - I can't help but think about oxymora. An older White man in an expensive button-downed shirt and fancy shoes sitting next to a laid back, ganja smoking black man? Seems like a tale of contradictions to me. Yet they had more in common than mere exterior glances would suggest. Both were co-workers, both were down for the \\"Yes We Can\\" movement, and both enjoyed my selection of Straits restaurant for dinner.Straits is a new Midtown restaurant by Atlanta 's own Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges and Executive Chef Chris Yeo. The duo brings fresh Singaporean and Asian-fusion flavor to a city known for Southern staples like buttered grits and ham hocks. What I adored most about the restaurant was that the relaxed atmosphere matched the comforting level of cuisine. A two-story wine cellar sits behind a glowing bar adorned with top-shelf libations. The main dining area features large windows perfect for people watching and cozy booths for intimate conversations. In fact, the booths came equipped with sequin-laced pillows that gave it a homely feel. Speaking of which, the restaurant itself seems to be within a converted house. The food was not the best Asian cuisine I've ever had, that title belongs to the West Coast. Yet it was still damn good. We tried three appetizers, or what Atlantans (and seemingly nouveau Spainairds) dub as \\"tapas.\\" The first was the Japanese-inspired Tuna Tower , a meticulously arranged bed of well-seasoned tuna tartar surrounded by crispy Won tons and dollops of Wasabi sauce. The second was the Indian-inspired Murtabak, which reminded me of a Jamaican beef patty (but cut like a quesadilla) since it was filled with beef flavored with cumin, tumeric and had a delightful curry sauce on the side. The final appetizer was the highlight and the reason why Ludacris decided to bring Straits to the \\"A.\\" The Kung Pao Chicken Lollipops were to die for! Crispy drumsticks drizzled in a red pepper infused teriyaki sauce and garnished with chopped peanuts. We were so glad the friendly waitress recommended them over the Spare Ribs. Main courses included Chinese Garlic Noodles with Chicken, Seafood Risotto blended with curry and Ayam Kalasan, breaded chicken with an Indonesian sauce called Kaffir Lime. All were good, but not in a blow-your-socks-off kind of way. If you've been paying attention, you would have noticed that while Straits bills itself as a Singaporean restaurant, nothing we had was ... Singaporean. However, for the ballers, the most expensive items on the menu (at the price of a VIP admission to the Velvet Room) - crab or lobster encrusted with your choice of either Chili or Black pepper - are what the menu calls, \\"Singaporean favorites.\\" Overall, I'd rank Straits a 3.5 on a scale of 5, but for Yelp, I'll bump it up to a 4.  I highly recommend Straits if you're ever in the mood to explore Southeastern Asian cuisine. It might seem intimidating, but I'm sure you'll find something your taste buds can relate to. Plus, you might spot a local celebrity or two."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love love love this pace!

The store hasn't changed at all really.  I was there for their opening day just three years ago, so it should still be in great shape and is.  What has changed dramatically is all the new construction, apartments in particular, and it's pretty amazing.

As long as I have been on Yelp, it has been the worst-reviewed restaurant in the Boston area, sharing a pantheon of \\"known\\" businesses like the MBTA B Line, or Jonathan Ressler, Photographer.  But Nan Ling is in a world by itself, a Chinese takeout place smack dab in the middle of Berklee, and near some Northeastern buildings.  It has never stopped at ever stoplight, and it has never declared Ali Lohan one of \\"50 of the most remarkable women anyone is likely to meet\\".  So it gets points there.  It is, in its own way, the king of the 2:30 AM delivery.Having never experienced its legendary wares, I felt it necessary to try it out.  It just so happened that Trish F. was looking for 3-Day Walk donations through dares, so I dared her to eat Nan Ling.  A lunch event was scheduled, and thus my journey began.For starters, the tables are very green.  I'm not sure if that's the greatest color to go with in a restaurant, but I'm not in the food service industry.  Also, the place was absolutely empty with the exception of one dude, and then later a Fed Ex guy and two other random guys. Most people seemed to go straight to the pho place next door.  That's never a good sign.We ended up ordering Sweet + Sour chicken and various drinks.  We got our food, and saw the probably overwhelmed and unneeded portions of food.   There are different ways one can put together sweet and sour chicken, but Nan Ling goes straight to the \\"chicken fingers\\" method.  Even the greasiest Chinese place I've ever been to (Mom's, a Chinese grocery store in Amherst where you could get an overwhelming amount of crap in one box for $5) went with the more popcorn chicken method.  And a thought: if they're that big, maybe a knife would be nice to have?   But I digress.The chicken wasn't that bad.  And in fact, neither was the rice.  But the sweet & sour sauce.  It wasn't sweet or sour.  It was like some weird caramel-y/maple syrupy mess that had a horrid aftertaste.  In my years of eating crappy Chinese food, this was the most terrible crappy food I've ever had :(Also, when we were leaving,we put our tray on the trash can, which was mysteriously in the doorway to the restaurant.So what have we learned from this journey?  That unlike some places, Nan Ling really is as bad as people think it is (except on CitySearch, where I think this place has 3 stars).    However, it's an experience all should go through.  Only then will you know the difference between greasy spoon good crappy food, and the one that's just crap."},{"name":"Escobar Restaurant and Tapas","address":"327 Peters St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"This place did not live up to the hype for me.

As soon as you walk in there is a huge brick BBQ pit with all kinds of delicious looking meat on it.The meat was PERFECT. So moist and tender, light smoky flavor (but not overbearing), just the right amount of fat on the brisket. It was probably the best BBQ I've had to date. The sausage was the unexpected star of the mixed plate I got. SO soft and flavorful and juicy! I wasn't really expecting that from sausage. Also, the BBQ sauces they have on the tables are AMAZING. Just sweet enough, little bit of smokiness, little bit of kick. So well balanced and you'll want to drench everything in it. The potato salad was the bomb too.

If they have room, I'd recommend asking to sit in their upper level. They've got a ton of window-side seating that instantly boosts the cuteness and hipster level of brunch through the roof! The food is pretty good. I think one of their signature items is the lemon ricotta stuffed french toast which comes out to about $11. I haven't had a chance to try it yet but it's on my list! I tried their corned beef hash which is made in house! Very tasty and tender but it's a little on the salty side so I would suggest asking for an extra helping of toast. Second time I came I ordered the specialty crepe which came with eggs, ham, onion, mushroom and hollandaise sauce. It wasn't bad. A few of my gripes -- my friend ordered a coffee drink that was super delicious but had some moist newspaper pieces at the bottom of the mug. I already read the Sunday funnies today, but thanks for the thought! The service is a little hit or miss which is problematic considering the kind of customer traffic this place gets on the weekends! It's a pretty tight spaces to begin with so being understaffed just spells danger. As far as good eats around Newbury goes, I'd still suggest checking this place out.

Hubby adores the gluten-free fish and chips.Two days after our visit, we tried the sister restaurant next store (Cookes of Dublin) and had GF fish and chips and GF onion rings.  The wait was around 30 minutes, so I recommend that route if you are in a hurry."},{"name":"Tiki Rock","address":"2 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went to Tiki Rock a few weekends ago.

Im 6 ft and could barely squeeze my knees under there. But that was just the beginning of the problems. On their flyer advirtisement it states that free parking is available at the rear of the restaurant. So we go back there and the sign in that lot clearly says \\"Only for customers of 6185\\" and their restaurant number is 8188. So I go into the restaurant to ask where this free parking is, and the guy there tells me that its all pay parking. Slightly frustrated at this point, i go park my car on the curb and pay $3 for parking. I come in and sit down in the restaurant and when the waiter came to take our order he was really slow. Then after ordering I asked him where this supposed free parking is. He says that it is on the other side of the complex and its underground.  So I am forced to get up in the middle of my meal and go to switch my cars parking spot. Their underground parking is in a kind of shady area and its EXTREMELY TIGHT so don't expect to fit any big cars in there. Thats only the parking issue, now we get to the food. The Hot and Sour soup was ok and thats the only part of the meal which i enjoyed. The fried rice is really plain with not much flavour. We also got the chow-mein noodles and they were really hard and almost inedible. Cleanliness was a HUGE issue in this place. The tables were not clean with pieces of food stuck to them and they chairs had some kind of sticky residue all over them. The walls were extremely dirty with stains and marks all over them. I'm pretty sure this restaurant would not pass Health Canada's sanitary standards.When we got our bill and went to pay, I honestly felt that because of all the previous mishaps with them, not to mention that it took FOREVER to get the food, I wouldn't tip them. The man who was processing the payment gave me a really dirty look and said \\"NO TIP FOR US THEN NO GOOD SERVICE\\" At this point feeling extremely displeased i left after paying. 2 hours later I'm writing this with a stomach ache. I would have given them a negative rating if I could but unfortunately I cant. Save your money, time, and your health and don't go to this place."},{"name":"Buddha Thai Cuisine","address":"2719 Iris Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"The Good:\\nBuddha Cafe is a hidden gem serving up authentic Thai food in a shopping center in North Boulder off 28th. I kind of don't want to even tell everyone how awesome it is because I love how easy it is to get a table (they do TONS of takeout) and I love hiding out here on holidays and weekends when everywhere else is packed.I am a curry fiend and was ecstatic to find Buddha Thai offers six different kinds of curry - red, yellow, green, Panang, massamon and jungle curry. You can get any curry with veggies, chicken, pork or beef -- each is the same price, even the veggies, but it's totally worth it because they treat veggies with the same respect as meat-- they give you TONS of veggies in huuuuge bowl of curry. You get your choice of brown or white rice, always hot & perfectly cooked.Tip: Their spice system is 1-5. I like spicy food and the level 3 I found to be really, really spicy -- not in a bad way, but it was definitely super spicy. We watched a kid get burned up on his level 4, and ordering a 5 is just unnecessary unless you want to be in physical pain (or you're Thai and can handle it). 2 is reasonable and will still be spicy.The Bad: \\nI wish they had real hot tea and not just tea bags. Not the worst thing but I like drinking tea while I'm eating with chopsticks :)The Food:\\nOverall, excellent but sometimes inconsistent. The first time I tried the Panang curry, I was in heaven and swore it was the best curry I've ever had -- the next time it didn't blow my mind but was still super tasty. \\nAll their curries are delicious, full of flavors, in generous potions and beautifully presented. The Service: \\nWe've always had good service here  - attentive, polite and friendly. Overall: \\nI love Buddha Cafe!!!\\nMy favorite spot for curry in Boulder, an understated and quiet place for authentic, spicy, delicious Thai."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We had the most amazing first experience at Atlanta Breakfast Club that we are going back again today!

He was patient as I stared at the menu... sooo many options! I decided to get 2 classic, 2 spicy, 1 paneer, 1 butter chicken, and 1 BBQ chicken. As I was waiting for the samosas to come out, he sparked conversation and explained how the samosas they make here are different from the ones they make in sweet shops. He explained that his crust (whatever it's called) is very thin and so the samosa is not as oily. Basically he told me his samosas were A1 so that set my expectations very high. I received my samosas piping hot within 5ish minutes and went grocery shopping before going home to eat them. When I got home, I was thrilled to see that the samosas were still warm, crispy, and not soggy as what I'm used to! Each bag was labeled which I appreciated because I wouldn't have known what's what otherwise. The samosa wrapper was indeed very thin and not oily at all; kind of like a spring roll. The bag barely had any oily residue as what you would expect from those 2 for $1 samosas. It was not overstuffed with potatoes, and thus smaller, but no complaints because no contents actually fell out as I was eating! The spicy samosa is actually very spicy. The butter chicken one was good and had lots of chicken in it. The chutney sauce was more sour and tasted like it has lots of tamarind in it? I liked it! Everything was so delicious! Service is great, place is clean, and food is good! I'm glad I checked this place out and will probably boycott all other samosa places."},{"name":"Tamarind Indian Cuisine","address":"501 N Orlando Ave, Ste 149","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"I come here regularly.

They've got a lot of obscure titles, too, among the best sellers. And they're awesome about special ordering something if they don't have it (and they also don't jack up the price because of it).

My friends and I got the original Banh Mi and the Bruce Lee-mi. Both were delicious, flavorful, and huge. Most trailers don't give you enough food to fill up even 50% of your stomach space, but we left full and satisfied. $6.50 for a 10-inch Banh Mi sandwich is a STEAL! I personally liked the Bruce Lee-mi better because I love char-siuew with everything and can never resist SAUSAGE. But if you like the original taste of Banh Mi, go for the regular one. Plus, the Bruce Lee-mi doesn't have pate (but I love egg in sandwiches, so couldn't resist that either). Besides the food--what made our experience so enjoyable was the service that we received. The two people working inside the truck were so friendly! The lady made a mistake on my change, so she gave me free pate inside of my Bruce Lee-mi! And my two friends who got the original were able to get free fried eggs inside of theirs. YUM YUM! I ordered a Japanese Korokke at the end to-go for my friend. As we were waiting, the lady ran out of the truck to our table, called me by name, and asked me if it was okay if they made me a potato Korokke instead of bacon since they had run out. She later ran back out to hand deliver the Korokke to me, and she gave me a Coconut Cream Bun on the house to make up for them not having bacon! So nice!Basically, I am very happy and full! Good food, awesome service! Yay! PS: They take Visa, Mastercard, cash, and Bevo Bucks (for y'all UT students).PPS: There are two websites up: atxfreshoffthetruck and freshoffthetruckatx.

I know this is the standard for \\"secret\\" \\"foo foo\\" \\"elitist\\" restaurants but it really shows how little fine dinning experience most Portlanders have that they think this place is such a big deal.... It's not.I'm not saying I think this place is not good but for what you are paying, for the hassle of the reservation, and the snobby staff it is simply not a 5 star experience compared to any REAL fine dinning restaurant. Just because you have a tiny location with a bookshelf for a door doesn't make the food any better. Again, its not bad food, just not 5 star in relation to creativity, execution, service and certainly not value.One recent review said \\"This is my first time eating a high end 6 month waiting list restaurant.\\"\\nYou don't say?...\\nThis really illustrates my point... If it is your first time, how can you really rate it? What is your point of reference? And what about waiting 6 months makes the experience better? They could easily go to a larger location to accommodate more people but then they would loose the manufactured \\"exclusivity\\" that makes most people think the food is more unique than it actually is.On the other hand, I completely agree with the review that talked about elevating traditional ingredients to make them outstanding. This place misses that mark. Nothing popped, nothing made me go \\"wow,\\" no dish tasted like more than the sum of their parts. The scallops in coconut for instance tasted like well, scallops and coconut.If I could call this place a week ahead of time, if it cost $50 pp and if the wait staff didn't think the sun shined up their ass I would give this place 5 stars in a heart beat.

The waffles were SO. GOOD. Actually the best waffles I've ever had, they were the perfect balance of soft and crunchy. They came with dipping sauces, we chose milk chocolate lavender, salted caramel, and pistachio rose water. This is a must order!! I liked the paella a lot, it was cooked properly and everything went together pretty well. I wasn't a fan of the bon matin mostly because I wasn't sure how to eat it.

Some fellow yelpers and I decided on Daedalus for dinner - it's unfortunate they don't take reservations for their outdoor tables but luckily our timing scored one. Just a word of caution (Trish F) - if you drop something off the table like a phone or purse, there is no need to SCREAM as it bounces through the railings. There's a ledge to catch stuff before it crashes to the sidewalk. The food here is mediocre at best. Better than Applebee's but pretty much up there with a Ninety-Nine Restaurant. Our server was wicked slow. She would stop by the table once a decade to deliver items or maybe check on us. Maybe. I probably could have read Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace\\" in the amount of time it took to pay our bill...did her legs fall off? So yeah...if you somehow get lucky with a table on their roof deck, awesome.

I always have the ribs , a must wow. And the Dounkey Duos , these mink sausages that are so delicious. The Schnitzel with the eggs on tops is amazing. The Irish bread there is so good they even sell it at their store right in the restaurant. This store is awesome , great gifts, shirts and books ect. A bit of everything.back to the food, the Brunch items are awesome, but they have good fish n Chips, they even have a side cookie fish and Chips restaurant attached. Drinks , of course , the bar is huge , decor , awesome and every drink you can imagine is here , very authentic Irish whiskers and beers. Mimosas in the brunch too. Friendly atmosphere and staff. Fun , music everywhere , and even in the bathrooms they have audio entertainment.

I love that I can take friends here and they're  wowed instantly by the look of the patio area and the view. Not to mention their Christmas light show is pretty festive and low key. Parking can be a headache but everything is accessible from a walk and if the night is nice, it's not so bad. Hula Hut, one of my more hated dining establishments (food is awful), is next door so it can get crowded.

Unfortunately I have had two horrible experiences and will not be returning to a place I used to rave about. The service was fine from our server Josh, but the food was awful. We ordered the buffalo wings for starters and burgers, the menu is now very limited and those are items you usually don't go wrong with. When ordering I was advised that they only have American and Gouda sliced cheese but had shredded cheddar. I went ahead and got the shredded cheese, but when the burger arrived it was cold and the cheese was not even melted. I had it sent back to the kitchen and a new one was sent. The burgers are $15 here and honestly you are better off at Steak and Shake, the burger was two flat over seasoned patties. The burgers used to be amazing here, but not any longer. The wings were ok at best, and the drinks were average as well. Then the fiasco occurs, If you call stats the recording advises that they provide validated parking. Well this is not the case because I was told since it's a game day they do not validate. The recording did not indicate that exception and the parking was $20 for 1 hour in a place with ok to bad food. The front staff was very rude when i asked for about the validation so I spoke with Tim the General Manager, he was not helpful at all. I advised him that my experience was awful and at that point I didn't eat but tipped the waiter and now I have to pay to get my car out to go eat somewhere else, smh. Needless to say I will not recommend this place any longer, I attempted to have a gathering there over the summer too and had the same lackluster experience.

I called ahead and asked - he said the doors open at 5:30, so it's best to get there at 5:20 (enough time to get a good spot in line) and as long as you're part of the first set of ppl into the bar (both the bar itself and the tables near the bar), you shouldn't have trouble getting the burger.\\nIt was a miserable freezing rain day. My girlfriend wanted to take our time as it was such miserable weather, but I said we are NOT messing this up - we DESERVE those burgers. So we got there at 5:20, right as like 4 other groups of ppl walked up.

I'm sure they hear this all the time - frantic ppl making sure to get on the list for burgers.\\nAnyway, we perused the menu, ordered some brussels sprouts as an appetizer, and got the burgers with fries. Bottom line: all the food was pretty great. The burgers (there is actually a recipe near the bathroom - so you can see the numerous ingredients in them, including beef, bone marrow, brisket, etc) were great. I eat a LOT of burgers and really enjoyed these. They melted in your mouth, but not all over your face. And full of all sorts of delicious carcass-y flavors. I added bacon, came with cheese, fixins, and a delicious sauce. We were both super happy.\\nBurger came with some thick steak fries that I believe were cooked in a truffle oil. Also pretty great. \\nAdditionally, the brussels sprouts were really good - very well flavored/spiced, and cooked in this almost burnt/crispy/moist way that I can't do on my own no matter how hard I try.\\nAlso drank some beer and wine with dinner - nice assortment of wine.

As I walked into DT Disney I was a bit annoyed and running very late but the first Disney cast member I saw was so happy and helpful that I felt much better.I ordered the fish and chips and my companion ordered the cottage pie. I'm always afraid to order fish & chips because it can sometimes be overly greasy and pretty unpleasant but Yelp led me to order the dish and it did not disappoint! The fish was breaded and fried but honestly didn't taste oily at all. The fries come in a paper cone and the server pours them out on your plate. The real winner was my friend with the cottage pie though. It was a massive punch if flavor in a beautiful presentation. Make sure to share with a friend or be prepared to take some home because it is enormous!

The hostess offered us inside or outside, but it was super hot out (big surprise Florida) so we opted to stay in.  Next time I will def sit outside as the restaurant is on Sand Lake and they have ample amounts of fans to keep it cool out there.  There's even a cool little gazebo and fire pit with chairs & benches carved from whole tree trunks.  Is this place just getting cooler by the second or what??Our server was super cool and made so many great suggestions; it was obvious that she wasn't just trying to up-sell us to the most expensive items on the menu.  I had California mahi tacos...super YUM!  The guacamole is practically famous; they make it table side and it's quite a nice touch.  I typically don't eat guacamole, but this was by far the best I've ever tasted.  They even offered to add a little extra kick if we wanted :-)  The chips are unbelievable and not greasy at all; I'd love to know what the spices are on there.Did I mention they have like 400 different tequilas??  And, no...that's not an exaggeration, they really do. My brother in law tried quite a few different one and all were tasty, but somewhat of a blur in retrospect.

The whole concept of Chipotle for Asian food is intriguing. Based on the Korean stone pot rice dish Bibimbop, the concept sounds deceptively simple. Good things: Bright clean environment, friendly and helpful staff, large selection of Asian inspired toppings and sauces, less than $10 price point per bowl. Negatives: food quality and taste. Maybe they try to cater to American palette but everything tasted too extreme for me. The spicy Sriracha sauce just a tab bit too spicy, the yum yum sauce too mayo like and the teriyaki way too sweet. The Kim Chi side dish was completely inedible. I threw most of it out because it didn't taste like kimchi. Instead it tasted like salted cabbage, way too salty with no flavor. Judging by their business and rapid expansion, I think this is a concept that can be scaled up. But without changing the fundamentals and making it taste good, I would not be recommending anyone to this \\"healthy\\" food joint."},{"name":"Sweet Chili Thai Cuisine","address":"470 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"I've ordered delivery to work a handful of times from here.

A friendly host/waitress took our lunch orders of soft tofu + seafood soup and bulbogi beef and rice.  Together these items came under $20. The beef with onion was delicious, the tofu soup heaped with tons of tofu, beef and seafood, was quite a bit more content than soup itself.  Seems to be quite an incredible deal.  The side mini-appy dishes I've had far better elsewhere, but the highlight of the meal was truly the lunch combos(as it should be, you could argue). So you need to come here, if you haven't already.

When asked to just bring one out (no split), they completely ignored the request bringing out two anyway.  I was fine to let it go, but then the owner visited my table in completely confrontational way.  I expressed my view kindly, and then let them know of  some other concerns I had with the meal - minor stuff that you'd think they'd be able to address.  I explained that the hostess wasn't very good, gave the wrong order to the kitchen, and honestly didn't deserve a  tip because of the attitude, long delay, and wrong order (and I TIP everyone at 20% regardless.).  When expressing that to the staff, the owner says \\"shame on you\\" in front of my children.  I asked them to box up the meal.

I usually get the shrimp and grits (which is quite possibly one of the best dishes I've had). This most recent time, I got biscuits covered in shrimp gravy and a side of creamy cheese grits (see photos). The biscuits are fluffy and tasted perfect soaked in the shrimp gravy. The cheese grits are a must every time solely because of how creamy and great they are. Many of my coworkers also rave about the P-Biscuit which is one of their notorious not-on-menu chicken biscuits with eggs and cheese on it.The cinnamon rolls (see photos)!!!!! They make them in house and I do not believe they are on the menu either. The rolls are typically sold out by noon, but we took an early lunch and I finally got to snag one. Best cinnamon roll I have ever had hands down and we got 2 to split among the table. We had 10 people, so it was more than enough due to how massive they are.

The waitress did not seem very apologetic, but nonchalant that we waited for a long time. Pretty rude. Then, after about 20 minutes of enjoying the board, I asked the waitress about our pizza. At this point, we have been at the restaurant for over an hour. Another staff member came back with our pizza with a complimentary bone marrow dish, apologizing for the long wait. I appreciated the kitchen for making up their mistake/long wait and giving us more cheese and appetizers to enjoy. They also took off the pizza off our bill, which was nice. But, I wish our waitress would have been more attentive and recognized that we waited for a long time.Our board was AMAZING, hence the four stars even with the inattentive waitress and the long wait.

Nice interior and atmosphere. Service was very attentive - though needs to improve in English comprehension (we cancelled a dish while ordering but she didn't understand...?).We ended up with the L.A. Galbi ($24), Pork Belly ($19) and two rice ($1.50 x 2). L.A. Galbi was tender and nicely flavored -- not too sweet or too salty. The pork belly was very crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. They also came with three individual side dishes: bean sprouts, pickled radish and Kimchi. None stood out. The Kimchi in particular lacked any flavor and just tasted faintly of vinegar.While both dishes were well prepared and tasted nice, they just were not good value for the price. For $24 you got 6 pieces of ribs(!) And for $19 you got 12 bites of pork belly. Our total was $55 with tip. With such small portions, the two of us immediately started talking about where to go next.TL;DR Nice flavor and the only Korean food in this area of Broadway, but dinner menu is way over priced.

By the time everyone had received their meal, half were cold and the other half rushed. We tried to call over a number of employees, and were turned a blind eye to half the time.

When we mentioned that this had made us late to an event we had planned, he remarked, \\"well I can't drive you there\\" suggesting we ought to leave to catch our event and not waste our time complaining. After speaking over us with an unexpected attitude, he reluctantly agreed to refund the 2 who waited for their meals, but would not offer anything else for our troubles.

No worries -- just follow the simple instructions up on the menu above for creating your perfect combination of a base (rice, rice noodles or greens), sides (yes, you get sides!), add-ins, four scoops of fish, and toppings, all for $12.50. The servings are HUGE. The fish (I had salmon, ahi tuna, spicy tuna, and hamachi) was fresh and tasted delicious alongside citrus kale, mango, cilantro, rice and the Original sauce. Next time, I'll try mixing two sauces as the menu suggests. Don't forget a Dole Whip or Dole Whip float -- perfect for washing down your meal and also dessert!"},{"name":"Sweet Chili Thai Cuisine","address":"470 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered drunken noodles mild spicy for take out.  the main complaint is that it's too salty and a bit oily.  It's a bit spicy for my taste but the turn off was the salt.  The portion was small also for dinner.  Usually that size I would probably finish the whole dish but I gave up after 1/2 and thinking that I would add some noodles myself to tone down the salt.  Brought it to work and didn't ended up eating it ...kinda forgotten about it so I was going to toss it and didn't think it was too much of a waste...except the money I paid for it.

The ambiance is fun and they're always playing throwbacks when I'm there.Last time I went though they tried to wedge as many tables outside as could fit, leaving me with barely enough room to sit at the table with it digging into me. I'm not sure how they thought that it was okay to leave three inches of room between the tables, but we got an inside table and all was well. I loved the 80s/early 90s music they were playing. I like that they have an espresso martiki with rum as I'm not a fan of vodka but I love me some espresso martini. The pork belly buns are divine, so much so that we ordered a second round. They're pricey at $7 per pork bun but so worth it.The second to last time we went we got one of the large bowls, the Painkiller, and it was definitely not enough drink for 4 people nor was it a deal at $60, so I would save your money there.Overall I want this place to be more than it is, but it's a good spot if you level your expectations, dig cool throwbacks, like a fun tiki vibe, and know what to order and what not to order (everything but the buns and ribs). Oh, and go somewhere before or after for a real dinner."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Okay, I am not from around here, but I heard good things about this place from a couple locals here.  We wanted to try all the good restaurants that Boston had to offer so we were willing to wait an hour, maybe two for good food.  We just got done from a long day of walking around.  We took our 6 months old baby with us.  Since we were still on Cali time (that's a 3 hours time difference), we thought our baby wouldn't mind waiting for a late dinner.  After 45 minutes of waiting in line, my husband and I, along with our baby, were getting kind of impatient waiting.  We were about to give up and were tempted to go to a restaurant next door that didn't have a line.  However, there was this lady in front of us who could not stop talking about how good this restaurant was.  Her actual words were the food melts in your mouth, the worker would go out of your way for you, and yada yada.  She pretty much convinced us to stay.  After finally getting in the restaurant after 2 hours, our waiter did not give us the time of day, and yes, the food was really good.  However, I could honestly say that it was not good enough for us to wait for two hours again.  What killed us was this restaurant was CASH ONLY!  Seriously, all these people who waited in line knew that this was cash only?!  I did not see that posted anywhere on the window!  My husband had to run across the street to pull money out of an atm.  How annoying was that.  Sorry, I was not that impressed."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"860 Virginia Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"3","text":"The customer service has significantly improved over the past year likely due to new management.

The gumbo was delicious, with just a small kick.For our meals we both decided on the 12 oz. New York Strip.  And we shared the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  When everything came out, our server stopped by to see how our meal was.  Once she was satisfied, she left us.  Didn't even see her until the bill.The potatoes and the spinach were very delicious.  My steak was a little over-cooked.  I had asked for it to be medium, but it came out medium-well.  It was still very flavorful and yummy.  My fiance was a bit disappointed with his steak.  It was extremely fatty, and was way too buttery.  For dessert we shared  the whiskey bread pudding.  I thought it was good.  It was warm, and gooey.

Our main course was the shrimp and scallop pasta: one dish with a spicy red cream sauce, and another with a non-spicy red cream sauce. I have never had such delicious sauce! It was game-changing. The seafood was also cooked perfectly, and the flavor was amazing. I would definitely return--even if it included a long wait!Just be aware: it's cash only!

On my most recent visit I got some of my favorites for an in-depth review. Here are my thoughts.Oreo cookie-sweet and creamy inside. Cookie is soft, cocoa flavor. Not crispy. Fresh made buttercream filling is much superior to that of a store-bought Oreo. Soft, creamy, and very sweet. I also appreciate that the filling doesn't stiff up like concrete to the cookie, but rather has a buttery consistency. The cookie itself is on the softer side, which would be my only complaint as I would like a little more crunch when I bite into the cookie. But it's perfect for those who prefer a softer style cookie. Banana bread has a soft and spongey texture. I think the bread used to be denser and heavier. Otherwise it is moist, sweet and has a ripe banana flavor. Walnuts are nice. Crust has a deeper molasses complexity. Carrot cake has a cream cheese frosting reminiscent of NYC style cheesecake, with a sour cream tang. Raisins, a hint of coconut and shredded carrots in tandem with cinnamon and nutmeg create a satisfying depth of flavor. The Boston cream cake is a layered version of the dessert. Several layers of whipped cream and cake. The whipped cream filling is a different experience than a traditional custard filling. Very creamy, but not as heavy. The whipped cream also delivers a little more flavor than a custard filling. Also seemed like the cake has been soaked in a coffee liqueur/syrup. Not a perfect Boston cream, but it is an interesting take on the dessert. Flour remains a solid recommendation."},{"name":"Nubian Queen Lola's Cajun Soul Food","address":"1815 Rosewood Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I feel shocked by these yelp reviews and the actual food I received.

As for rides in Island of Adventure, the Hulk Roller Coaster was AMAZING and by far my favorite.  As you stroll throughout the park you can't help but bump into your favorite characters and take advantage of super fun photo opportunities (Captain America, Spiderman, X-Men etc).  When on a family vacation with kids or looking for something fun to do amongst adults, this is a perfect venue and choice to spend an entire day or night while on vacation.

Every time we've come to visit Austin we have been unable to eat here for one reason and one reason only. The very nice and wonderful owner of the restaurant is also the cook, so when she is not available for any reason the restaurant is closed. We called ahead and spoke with Ms. Lola several times and she assured us that she would be available. Upon answering the restaurant it's a very small unassuming hole in the wall typos spot. The whole restaurant is about the size of a semi-large living room. Miss Lola has her Louisiana culture all over the restaurant you can see Mardi Gras beads hanging from the ceiling and Bible scriptures written throughout the restaurant which was awesome to us. Lola the Owner came and greeted us with a big hug like we were family and welcomed us to the restaurant. We love the fact that she was able to create a meal for us because my wife had a special nutritional request and I couldn't decide on what I wanted on the menu so she created a meal for us. This restaurant was one of the best that we've been to out of town. It's probably the only soul food restaurant in Austin so you know it had to be good. We were not aware that her restaurant only took cash so we had to go up the street to a nearby convenience store to use the ATM. So keep in mind yelpers that Nubian Queen Lola DOES NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS CASH ONLY!!!Our food came out very hot and fresh we could not decide on what sides we wanted so she recommended the cabbage in the smothered potatoes which were very good. We didn't order any of her special Cajun tea we just had water. The cornbread could've been a little more moist but the restaurant still gets four stars because the total meal was very good. It's not the type of restaurant that you'll go to with a very large party but she does offer catering services for large groups and events. We would've tried the gumbo because that was the daily special but we ended up getting a chicken and seafood combination.  For dessert we tried her French beignets and they were some of the most delicious greasy New Orleans style dessert we've ever had, the confectioners' sugar that was on it just took it to the next level it was so good I have to stop myself or I would eat the entire orderWe will come back sometime in the near future if wherever in Austin and we're looking for some good down-home Southern cooking."},{"name":"Maria's Pastry Shop","address":"46 Cross St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has the best cannoli ever, better than the ones I have had in New York's little Italy.It's a small family owned business and they make fresh cannoli, fill the fried pastry dough roll with fresh cream of your choice.I got the ricotta cheese cream and it was heavenly.

That was seasoned perfectly and had a bit of crispness to it as well. For dinner, I got the scallop fried rice bowl. I adored that the rice was crispy, I've never had that before and now I want my rice served like that always. The scallops were cooked well, and everything still re-heated the next day really nicely for leftovers. I liked the funky decor, but agree with other reviewers that the connection door to the bike shop is a bit odd and the bright lighting doesn't lend itself to the typical restaurant ideal experience.

Now, it's FANTASTIC. The Copper Rocket is a dark, dimly lit bar. It's not a huge place, but has ample seating and a really nice bar. There's a little stage, and on my first visit they had a singer with an acoustic guitar playing. The music wasn't terribly loud and it just made the atmosphere feel how a bar should feel: fun, noisy but not too noisy, and comfortable. They seem to have a nice selection of draft beer and bottled beer. They also have ample wine for a bar of this category and LOTS of tvs. We all tried the onion rings, the wings, and the burgers. All of them were excellent. My wings were great! They were crispy, and they weren't huge wings (I prefer a smaller, crispier chicken wing). They were nice enough to mix the medium sauce with the bbq sauce for me. The presentation was nice too. I'd absolutely get the onion rings again too. They are crispy and delicious and come with a nice sauce. I saw a couple of people get the nachos and they look amazing, so I'll definitely try those next trip.Overall, this is a cool place.

The oysters here are on point, and are accompanied by a nice array of sauces including house Mignonette, cocktail sauce, Sriracha, and tabasco.In addition to oysters we also ordered black fish and scallop ceviche from the raw bar. I don't know when the restaurant started tossing sweet potato chips on top of their ceviche, but it didn't used to be like this. The ceviche is already on the oily side, but the sweet potato chips are not only are obnoxious in that they obscure the ceviche, they muddle the taste. You still taste the lime and shallot, but the overuse of olive oil combined with the sweet potato chips really ruins this dish. I understand the chips can provide some nuance, texture and perhaps act as a palate cleanser, but they should be served on the side, not on top. I do not recommend ordering these ceviches.Clam chowder is satisfactory. It is a one note chowder, there is one large saltine cracker in the center of the dish. Small bits of clam, bits of celery, potato and ham. The ham is salty and detracted from the experience with its cheap taste. Consistency is good, not as thick as some other places. This chowder is definitely more buttery than creamy. But again, because the ingredients do not retain much individuality, everything blends together into a mostly one note, basic chowder. Fried Oysters are also satisfactory. Not much flavor in the batter, oysters are juicy, with a subtle brininess. The tartar sauce is on point, creamy but not too thick so it coats the food perfectly. Made fresh and not from a bottle like some other places.The french fries unfortunately left much to be desired. Most were soggy, lacked both texture and flavor. The flavor was a bland flavor, like fries that have been left around past that crucial period when they are hot off the grease. We did not finish our fries. Grilled salmon, again, is satisfactory. The salmon itself was a little rubbery, perhaps overcooked.The flavor was dull. What does make this dish interesting is the vegetables, which outshine the salmon itself. The yogurt curry on the side offers a unique complexity in tandem with the slightly charred, nicely cooked carrots, chickpeas, grains  and onion. The carrots in particular have a great balance between being raw and cooked, soft slightly charred outside, soft al dente in side with a distinct sweet carrot flavor. Mixing with the salmon does well the compensate for the lack of flavor in the fish. Lastly was the lobster roll. If you come to Row 34 this would be the dish I recommend you order. I got the hot roll. The roll is simple, large chunks of buttered lobster piled onto a toasted roll that has seemingly been soaked in butter.The combination of lobster and butter is nice, and the buttered roll has a nutty undertone, which provides a nice complexity. My only complaint is that the texture on the lobster was a little too chewy for my taste. The house made chips that came with the roll were good, clean tasting and crunchy. Row 34 used to be one of my Boston standbys, unfortunately over the years I am sad to say the quality is on the decline. The oysters and lobster roll are still on point, but there are some spots in Boston that do it better. The ceviche, chowder and fried dishes, leave something to be desired."},{"name":"River Maiden","address":"5301 E Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place so much, except for how it's in a weirdly ugly part of town.

I think I'm finally over the pumpkin trend and probably never need another PSL in my life. On my next two tries I had peppermint mochas and they were consistently great from visit to visit. My husband always gets a double shot of espresso wherever we go, and prefers River Maiden to Dutchie's or Blackie's (are these real nicknames? If not please commence using them.).I would like River Maiden more only if they were closer in town or had multiple locations, because I need them in my life more regularly."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I love the create your own board option that they have here.

The portion is definitely enough to fill up one person and it would be perfect with a refreshing drink.

Other factors during my experience was very off-putting or distasteful, hence the rating is at 3 stars. I felt the prices were a bit on the pricier side for the quality of ingredients I was getting. There was some dishes, which I felt a bit more \\"Americanized,\\" but there also many traditional Japanese dishes, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Overall, the food was great. The three areas, which place this restaurant at 3 stars for me, are as follows:(1) Gnats and bugs. This was my first time at the restaurant, and I was pleasantly surprised by the interior and the \\"garden\\" outside from our view. What threw me off was the flock of gnats and flying bugs that kept pestering the table. One of them committed suicide into my green tea. As I am eating my food or drinking my tea, these bugs definitely killed the mood. In a restaurant in the U.S.A., these type of bugs should not exist in doors. Even eating at outdoor places in New York City, I did not have this problem. The fact that so many of these bugs persisted across the restaurant was very alarming for me. (2) Price... I know what goes into these dishes or at least to make these dishes... I just felt some of the dishes were a bit overpriced for what you are getting. It was mostly the \\"Americanized\\" dishes, and it could be that because typical people do not know better. Since the restaurant is doing well and has been around for so long, I guess it's working. (3) Our waitress seemed a bit off... She had hard time explaining things and seemed very frazzled. She also screwed three different times with the one of the people's orders at our table. Also, the dishes came out at all different times. Some people were left sitting there watching others eat while others were done already. I had the \\"Traditional\\" bento box, which I fairly enjoyed. If you are in the mood for some Japanese bento, please try this. The \\"beef teriyaki\\" was ok... it had a cheap teriyaki sauce feel to it, but I mainly got it because I needed the protein after a work out. This was a bit overpriced like I alluded at the top that \\"Americanized\\" dishes were overpriced for what you get. Will I go back on my own, probably not. If all my friends want to go for dinner there, sure, I don't mind.

They're tucked against the wall and the only seats with a little privacy, as well as a nice cool breeze from the open kitchen's a/c. Why we love this place? It's completely no nonsense. Cash only (if you don't have enough cash, there's an ATM across the street), they don't take reservations, they don't offer desserts or coffee (too many cafes and sweets in the North End already), you pretty much don't have a choice of where they seat you (you don't like the table, try the restaurant next door then), and the average bottle of red wine is $19!! I mean seriously, where else can you get a bottle of Montepulciano or Malbec for $19 in a restaurant? I think the most expensive was a Barolo for $40. And that in itself is quite a steal because we've never seen a Barolo for less than $50 in a liquor store. My husband wanted the Barolo, but I told him I've never met a Montepulciano I didn't like. So we went with my Monte and we were not disappointed. Food, where should I begin? We started with the app special which was tomatoes and Buffalo Mozzarella. Interestingly enough, they've diced up the tomatoes for you. I think I would've like to have sliced my own tomatoes, but whateva. The mozzarella was simply melt in your mouth. Both of us then ordered the entree special, which was 1/2 lobster, mussels, and clams over linguine with your choice of sauce. My husband had his with spicy fra diavolo sauce and mine came with pesto and pine nuts. What was so special about this dish? It was $22!!!! That included a half lobster on each plate. And I don't mean a little itsy bitsy lobster, I mean a really nice size lobster with a huge claw! Amazing! Plentiful and delicious. We left around 7ish and the line was already around the corner.

They clearly have something going with reservations stacked for 6 months. Don't come thinking you're getting great value, you won't, it's clearly labeled $$$$.  It's worth trying once if you can swallow the price tag. For me the food was good, I had a good time, but I've also had better Thai in Portland, just not as well presented as this place.Details:\\nWell, after a 6 month wait, our reservation finally came. Hidden within another restaurant is a 22 seat room with a bar/kitchen area and other traditional seating. So I get the exclusive vibe they portray.As communicated online and the menu of the month, a set course consisting of multiple snacks, soup, salad, entrees and then dessert. Warning: to folks who are not used to raw dishes you either need to call in advance or wait for a menu during another month that perhaps you'll like better.The highlight was the first 2 snacks/appetizers, a shrimp wrap and a coconut based scallop cup. Both of which were poached. Coconut milk was done very well. Another entree this month was a duck based dish done fairly well too.If my review was strictly on food quality, it's a 3.5 star review. I am critical of one thing is that this month's menu had several dishes that included a heavy dose of fish sauce, which at least to me doesn't cover the vastness Thai cuisine has to offer. One snack was a beef tartare, and it was to me overly salty, in fact our 10ppl group all said the same thing, about 1/3 of the dishes were too salty. For half the group, it was their 3rd time, they would know.For quality of experience, also 4-star.For value, and any repeat value, let's just say really tough to praise this place on that."},{"name":"Modena Pizzeria","address":"241 S Westmonte Dr, Ste 1050","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4","text":"Small mom and pop hole in the wall.

As long as FLORIDA's beer scene is strong, I don't care if it's coming from Tampa or Miami, or Broward or West Palm. Having deliciously crafter brews a few hours away is a win for me....I mean everyone ;DAlso, this is why I love Yelp. Whipped out the app. Saw this \\"Hot & New\\" business just 1.1 miles away and headed over RIGHT when they were opening. Would have never stumbled across this gem otherwise.They just opened up shop a few weeks ago and are still brewing small batch. So much so that they couldn't do growlers of the two beers I really loved. The brewer told us that if he did growlers only a handful of people would be able to try them. He rather have it by the glass only so multiple people could taste the goodness. I respect that.The one that might have stolen the show for me was a strawberry beer (was it a wheat?) -- I can't remember the name right now. It was refreshing, light and had a really strong strawberry flavor. Delicious! Blissful Dawn Porter was also super solid. This dark, roast porter is brewed with barrel aged maple syrup. I wanted french toast with this beer. Just thinking about it I want French toast now. Dammit. There was also exceptional service. You can tell how much the brewer loves making beer. He spoke to us about how the brewery came to be and how the name is a combination of two nano breweries: Broken Strings and Black Cauldron. They are now called Broken Cauldron. Pretty cool.The tap room is one of the funkier ones I have seen. There's a really cool vibe - a lot of windows, so it's nice and bright during the day and there's cool music inspired art.

I was excited to hear about this a few months ago, especially since the pub that used to be here was nothing special.  We finally made it for lunch to celebrate our anniversary.The menu has a good variety: small plates, soup, salad, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and entrees.  Many things sounded delicious, and the server's recommendations aligned pretty well with what I was already seriously considering, so that made the ordering fairly easy.  We opted for the caesar salad, the soppresate piccante pizza, and the orecchiette pasta, all to share.Almost immediately, warm sliced bread arrived with balsamic and olive oil for dipping.  The salad came quickly.  It's billed as being \\"\\"teenage\\" romaine, poached farm egg crouton, white anchovy, reggiano\\", and it's definitely a new take on caesar.  The flavors were quite intense and somewhat unexpected, so it took me some time to appreciate.  It was a little heavy on the dressing for my taste.Shortly after finishing the salad, the pasta and pizza came out.  The server then offered and brought out calipreza pepper, crushed red pepper, and fresh grated parmesan.  She left the small dish of peppers, but dispensed the crushed red pepper and parmesan herself.  The orrecchiette was dressed with cubes of local sausage, turnip greens, and reggiano. The pasta was perfectly cooked, and the flavors were wonderful.  It's a great combination, but I felt that I could make it myself at home.  The pizza was great.  One of the best neapolitan pizzas in town.  Though it didn't have much char, which I love, the crust was nice and crispy throughout, even the center.  The sauce was only slightly sweet, and the soppresate was indeed spicy, just by itself.  I will definitely be back for this pizza.The interior is beautiful, very warm and cozy.  Instead of benches for booths, they have wingbacked love seats.  The table tops are polished wood.  The decor also includes wood (presumably for the pizza oven, though not sure it's ever actually used) mixed with the alcohol bottles, and black and white images on the walls.  There is a TV over the bar, which was showing famous food and bar clips from the movies.With the addition of CeB to this strip mall, the parking lot is maxed out, so they now have valet, even for lunch.

Their menu is simply outstanding. The addition of french toast made me so happy I could have hugged the cashier! Warning though, just one slice is plenty for lunch - I couldn't eat the second! They label each item on the menus with special demarcations like vegetarian and gluten free, which makes enjoying specialized food here much easier. One super highlight is the ability to order any sandwich as a salad - sans bread - which was perfect for my gluten free kick I'm on this week! *I actually had a wonderful and delicious salad at a bakery today.* It was incredible.

That's every single thing you'll eat at Kappo. You'll leave the place on a food high that will last for a while. My friend and I were making a trip to East End Market on my birthday and passed Kappo. Seeing two spots open we jumped on the chance and just went for it! We did the Magical Mystery Tour after some convincing from the staff and customers. I'm honestly so glad that we splurged and did it. It was a delightful few hours of round after round of freshly prepared fish and food. I was apprehensive because sushi is not something I'm too familiar with yet, but the chef explained everything and the purpose of all parts of the meal. It was fantastic.

In the case of the late Ray Sawyer, it was getting his \\"picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone,\\" for the latter it must be owning the most swill slingin' slop houses on the Space Coast.  As I have only been to one, I guess that isn't fair of me to prejudge the other two, but if I go by this meal...Stepping inside the brightly painted Mexican/Cuban themed spot, Chaparral Mexican Grill in Cocoa, I was greeted, seated and handed a menu professionally.  Awaiting my server, I took the opportunity to read the menu.  They claim to be Mexican/Cuban, but I found the bulk of the offerings to be of a Cuban nature.  Shortly after being seated, I was approached my my server, Maribel.  Sadly, this was the second place today where the service was glacial.  Other than being slower than a snail on a Minnesota winter morning, Maribel did a bang up job.  I asked her for one order of Tacos de Carne Asada.With plenty of time to kill while waiting for my food (did I mention the sluggardly service?), I shifted my gaze towards my surroundings.  If the menu in a supposedly Mexican/Cuban joint was leaning a bit towards the Cuban side and not so much the Mexican side, the walls certainly more than made up for it.  With pictures of rifles, some wagon wheels and a long horn skull thrown in, I got the feeling I was in the prop department of the University of Texas (hook 'em Horns)!  Just as the longing for a good college football game was reaching it's zenith, Maribel was seen ponderously approaching my table.  The chips and salsa that are complimentary in most restaurants like this were, I kid you not, not only from Sam's' Club, but were stale as all get out to boot!  The salsa literally had zero flavor.  The rice found on the side of my Tacos de Carne Asada likewise had zero flavor.  It was like I was eating little white puffs of air.  The re-fried beans had the consistency of so much baby kaka, looked the same and had zero flavor as well (I was actually thankful for that),  Now, on to the Tacos de Carne Asada.  I figured with the crappy sides and stale gratis chips, they only direction to go for this meal was up.  Man, was I wrong.  To begin with the tortillas that made up the Tacos were, like the chips, stale beyond belief and tasted not unlike Styrofoam packing peanuts.  The meat is so low grade it is almost horse meat.  Now, horse meat may be a delicacy in France, but I assure you, this is not France (we never give up #Murcia)!!  The meat was so horrid as to be rendered inedible and I was forced to spit it out.  I tried to take one for the team, but I just couldn't force it down no matter how much I tired.  This place is worse than the Alamo on their worst day and they are now out of business due to several factors, chief among those the plethora of health code violations they received just prior to closing for good.  I can unequivocally say that my meal at Chaparral Mexican Grill was absolutely disgusting and well deserved of a Swill Alert.

Please say yes we have one left but no belly for me. Ok Man up I want a bang bang shrimp and a chicken. Oh no you forgot the short rib. I wanted short rib not chicken. The guy behind the counter gave me the in he repeated my order that's it your in. Go for it no I want a short rib too.

Most recently, I had a seafood fusilli, which had a nice texture but not enough depth of flavor and the lobster was not well integrated. My friend had a chicken marsala pasta, which ended up being pretty tough and lacking flavor. Both of us enjoyed the food enough but agreed it didn't leave an impression. The times I came previously were similar - I can't remember what I ate because I was generally pretty bored each time.I'd have to say there are Italian places with more deep, complex, or soul-food flavors scattered throughout Boston with more atmosphere and less crazy fanfare.
