Two things, I was told by two different employees at two different times at there was a DJ at 9pm, or 930.

Stay away from the prickly pear martini. It's simply not good and should be taken off the menu, 6 plus opinions on this on two different visits confirm it, it's not good.

We came here cause the portions are huge, big selection of items and generally speaking - cause it's a chain- we don't need to worry too much about variation in taste.  Thus, we're able to focus on the main attraction - us, not the food.  I know, I know, yelpers are probably thinking - the whole point of writing a review is to write about the food.  And that is true, just not 100% of the time.  So, these are the usual suspects that we feast on - that pretty much is a guarantee that you will leave satisfied.  The key to eating at this eatery - is to eat chinese family style.  That way you can taste a bit of everything and not get bored of the dish in front of you.  So...for the four of us, we usually end up getting 3 dishes and split everything.  We got the Chinese Chicken Salad (dinner portion), the Thai Chicken Pasta (dinner portion) and the The combo Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane.  These are pretty safe bets when you dine there.  Just don't make the mistake of expecting the quality of the steak to match Stony River in Duluth, or the Thai Chicken Pasta to be able to compete with your favorite Thai restaurant..just don't do that and come with the mindset  you are there to catch up with friends and  you'll leave pretty happy.  Oh, also can't leave w/o a cheesecake - they're pretty damn good - even better sharing with friends.

Unfortunately, that is what I got served. It was literally salted green cabbage -- like salty, dry, unadorned cole slaw ingredient, and was nothing like actual Sauerkraut like I have had in Munich. It is supposed to be fermented, soft, and warm, usually with caraway seeds. It boggles the mind how a German Biergarten/B√§ckerei could screw up such a core food item.

Mind you, this is a good joint and I intend to return soon, more for the ambiance and good drinks, not so much for the food.\\n\\nAnyways, this is what we had:\\n\\n* kimchi tasting\\n* red curry venison kabob with grilled bread and cucumber salad\\n* sunchoke and fennel over egg with pistou (garlic sauce)\\n* foie gras and pork belly bahn minis\\n* pulpito estofado - braised octopus with \\"corona\\" beans, pepper sauce\\n* lemon panna cotta thyme bomb\\n\\nThe kimchi tasted like kimchi, kabob tasted like kabob, pork belly tasted like pork belly. All good, well cooked, but nothing revelatory or spiritu-orgasmic.  Cucumber salad with kabob was mushy. Octopus was perfectly tender and tasty with the dark ragout, almost like a black bean sauce. The panna cotta underwhelmed, too soft, the thyme \\"bomb\\" at the bottom interesting at first, but not complex or subtle. I was leaning towards the popcorn ice cream, that wonderful salty-sweet combo I've had elsewhere... maybe next time...  \\n\\nAs for service, I felt a little rushed... our waiter wanted to bring our check yet we hadn't finished our drinks and it wasn't as if we lingering for long.  This was dinner time too, not like we were suits taking a quick power lunch.  Plate clearers didn't seem friendly either, even though my garrulous friend was making funny small talk with them. \\n\\nWhat I really liked about Swift, though, was the ambiance, eclectic and romantical, a perfect date place as long as it's not too crowded.  I like the staggered layout, some leather booths,  those popular big tungsten hanging lights, mix of modern and old country. The bar at the entrance looks inviting, the kind I could linger at for a while.  My friend had a negroni with sparkly, a great aperitif, while I enjoyed a sour Belgian and a wit... good drinks selection...

I've been to so many restaurants in St. Johns, which are wonderful, but I've been wanting to branch out to some on Williams.  When I did my research like a good Yelper, Tasty n Sons jumped right out and I thought \\"why didn't I think of this first\\"!\\n\\nWe were seated within about 5-10 minutes at a community table, and our charming server was there shortly thereafter.  She gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu while getting us our beverages (iced tea and coffee).  I settled on the bacon burger, and my manager decided on Cobb Salad.  We had a great time whilst waiting for our food talking about this, that, and the other thing.  \\n\\nThe Cobb Salad when it arrived amazed us both - it wasn't just a bowl full of gorgeous salad; it was a BOWL FULL OF GORGEOUS SALAD.  Lots of eggs and bacon and chicken with super fresh greens.  There was so much that I shared some with my boss and I can vouch to its freshness and flavorosity.  If you are in want of a good salad, do order this.  \\n\\nThe burger - such a great burger.  The meat was obviously of high quality and seasoned correctly.  The bacon on the burger was a whole symphony (if you will) of flavors (sweet, salty, smoky) as was the cheese.  I've had some good burgers of late, but this one was pretty much top of the heap.  It was all pulled together on an excellent bun from which the meat and other goodies did not fly out when I bit down.  The combination of pickles and onions and lettuce was so flavorful that I did not need to add condiments.  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is extremely attractive and perfectly attuned to the Williams Avenue vibe and the Portland and Pacific Northwest vibe as well.  It impressed my manager and I enough that we want to come back and bring friends with us for drinks and/or dinner.  I thought lunchtime prices very reasonable with more than enough food to almost be rolled out the door in a wheelbarrow (of course one doesn't have to eat everything, but seriously it's hard not to).  Service was so good that you almost don't notice it, but really do take notice.  It takes talent and hard work to be that smooth and subtle.\\n\\nA visit to Tasty n Sons is worth your while on all levels.  It's very worth the drive over if you live further out.

We wait patiently, waitress is MIA. After watching our food in a window for a solid 5 minutes they arrive. Burgers show up burnt dry and burnt to a crisp  with  stale buns and cold fries. I decided I could deal with the burger but the fries were sent back, Waitress shows up after I'm done with the burger to tell me the kitchen just dropped a fresh batch, nope they just reheated the old fries so now they were hard as a rock but hot.  Drinks were empty half the time, after my husband left to wait in the car with our son the waitress trying to save face I'm sure refills his drink... I waited for the check for another 10 minutes.

One look at its close proximity, reasonable prices, and tasty-looking pictures and I knew I had to try it for dinner. \\n\\nI arrived at about 5:45pm on Thursday to find 2 diners enjoying their meals outside at the clean patio tables. Within the small, empty restaurant, a friendly, older Korean man greeted me and took my order. When I first ordered the spicy chicken burrito, he helpfully told me that the bibimbop burrito would also include traditional bibimbop veggies within for only $1 more. I went with his suggestion and also got a tofu taco, spicy pork taco, spicy chicken taco, and K-fries. Don't judge! I was ordering for 2! \\n\\nHe went to the back to call out my order. 1 Korean woman and another Korean man appeared to make the food. While I waited, I chatted with the guy in the front. Surprisingly, they had been open for 7 months already. Again, why had I not heard of them?? My order was packed and ready in a little less than 10 minutes. \\n\\nThank goodness the food was still hot when I got home. \\n\\nSpicy Chicken Bibimbop Burrito ($8) - Yum!! They had pressed the burrito in a panini press so the outside was nice and crisp. Within, there was a generous amount of kimchi fried rice mixed with gochujang (spicy bean paste), chicken, and the sesame(?)-dressed veggies (lettuce, carrots, bean sprouts, and more). It came with a container of hot sauce and sour cream. The burrito could have been spicier, but it's still sooo good. \\n\\nTacos - All of the proteins were very well-seasoned and marinated. They were topped with crisp romaine lettuce and some shredded mixed cheeses. I wish they had put a little more thought into the toppings, like some stronger Mexican cheeses or dressed greens instead. Still, they were very tasty and only $2.50 each! \\n\\nK-fries - these were a little soggy by the time we got home, but they were generously dusted with a mix of spices. A small container of chili-ketchup was provided. Good, but not mind-blowing. \\n\\nI will definitely be returning in the future and not just because I had promised the owner(?) I would. Fast service, tasty food, good prices, close proximity - who wouldn't return? I really hope more restaurants like KBBQ Taco (previously BBQ Takorea) open up within a 5 mile radius of Emory.

Our waitress was relentlessly lazy, unresponsive and we ended up placing most of our order with a second waiter, who forgot what we had ordered, and at times, forgot to put in our orders. It began with ordering a beer, which took 20 minutes to get and I had to ask 3 times. The fact is the restaurant was empty, our waitress was on her cell phone the whole time, and the fact I had to ask 3 times for a beer is unacceptable. They then took our entree order wrong or delivered the wrong food, but the waitress wasn't even available to let know we had gotten the wrong food. We then had to get the waiter to get us our check, which took 10 minutes to get the first check. After we gave our cards, another 15 minutes passed by. This is usually when even a horrible waitress delivers quick service with a smile. Literally no where to be found. The owner was going table to table asking how things were. We told him what had happened, he offered us a discount, however while at the table the waiter, not even our waitress, returned with our cards. He offered us a gift card but we made it clear we didn't intend to return. The food was decent, I'll say that but the service tonight was embarrassing. As we got up to leave, the waitress did not even say \\"thank you\\" or \\"have a nice night.\\" Just sat there texting away as she did all night. I always tip 15-20% if someone is at least kind and works hard, regardless of orders being screwed up, etc. I get it, that stuff happens.

Now I don't have a problem with just a plain old hamburger bun, but there is something to be said for using something from one of the many killer bakeries we have in town, as good bread can make a good sandwich great. \\n\\nMy only real complaint is the sides and the cost of some of the menu items. The mac and cheese was nothing different than what you would get from a hot case at a grocery store and the same goes for the potato salad. If I'm going to pay $3 for a small side of mac and cheese, it better be the real deal and the same goes for potato salad etc. Commitment to make everything on the menu, even sides, quality and home style makes a big difference and could help take Touchdowns from being decent, to being awesome.

My only complaints are that sometimes their mussels aren't all debearded or could be fresher and their house special shrimp dish was a miss.  There weren't many shrimp, maybe 4-5 pieces and the dish was kind of bland.  Perhaps it would have had more flavor if they had packaged it better for takeout - a lot of sauce leaked out of the styrofoam clam shell container despite the fact we were careful about walking it back home.

We ordered the mushroom toast because we were told that it was a big portion and one of the waiter's favorite dishes. When it arrived, we realized we had been ripped off. It was for literally a small pile of mushrooms on top of 2 half slices of thick bread sitting in a mushroom cream sauce on top. Three bites each, not good, not filling, and not a large portion. The corn was extremely salty. Deep down I think this dish probably had a nice flavor, but it was overshadowed by the unnecessary amount of salt. The gnocchi was $19.00 for maybe 8 gnocchi's (total) and some meat sauce. It had absolutely no taste or flavor other than meat. This dish actually needed some salt but seems to have been the one dish that was overlooked by salt fairies in kitchen who were too busy showering all of the other dishes to excess. Besides the lack of flavor, we had to wait about 25 minutes before the gnocchi came out. And when I say 25 minutes, I mean it took 25 minutes from the time we had finished the all of our other dishes until the time the gnocchi finally arrived. Overall, we spent $115 for a terrible meal. I will never go back there.

Especially since I haven't regretted donating the metaphorical kidney. \\n\\nI went to the hospital the very next day for a COMPLETELY unrelated reason, and I can still recollect fondly my meal from the night before without feeling nauseous. In fact, I would like to go right back and have at it. \\n\\nFriend and I have only one complaint, that despite having reservations it took a long time to be seated. I wanted to order the pork tenderloin off the a la carte menu because it looked that good, but the kitchen had run out by then. \\n\\nFinal order was two restaurant week menus, with an additional appetizer of lobster ravioli. Speaking with restaurant owners, I have got a sense that some establishments use restaurant week to make a killing. In other words, their ingredient selection and preparations are mindful of the tighter budget, and it does not adequately showcase the abilities of the chef. It just gets the folks in and profits up. That's a pretty cynical opinion as they go, but 49 social really steps up to the plate. \\n\\nThe menu selection was artful, well thought out, and clearly demonstrated effort on the part of the kitchen. Scallop ceviche with melon sorbet was the perfect combination, unexpectedly full-tasting and sharp but nicely rounded out by the delicate melon flavor.\\n\\nFor entrees, we had the quail and truffle tagliatelle. We cleaned our plates.\\n\\nTo apologize for our long wait, we were each given a complimentary glass of prosecco and our lobster ravioli appetizer was on the house.\\n\\nBetween the two of us, we guzzled our way through a 2007 bottle of Cote Du Rhones, 3 glasses of prosecco, one white wine, 2 restaurant week 3 course meals with creme brulee and strawberry shortcake (couldn't really taste the peppercorns in the icecream) for dessert, and lobster ravioli. We had not leftovers.\\n\\nFor a Bacchian night of excess, the weight gained and money lost came out to a perfect balance.

Everything looked great and the chocolate cake thingy I got (either a kind of mousse cake or perhaps a flourless cake?) was amazing. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and efficient and the the woman at the front (who I think is the owner?) cheerfully greeted customers as the entered and exited.

Keep in mind not once were we offered anything to drink. At last our food arrives to the table and burrito was huge! I had a bite and it was almost worth the attitude we received alongside the dirty looks. Meat was fresh, tomatillo sauce was authentic. Enchiladas came out and they were delicious as well, rice was definitely dry. We even ordered a few tacos at $2 a piece why not? Chorizo would be my recommendation.

It was a lovely evening."},{"name":"Stir It Up","address":"84 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"My coworkers and I dined here for lunch on a Tuesday. There were 10 of us and when we arrived at the restaurant at 11:40, the entire place was empty, however, as the lunch crowd began to trickle in, the place became more and more packed--so much so, the two servers almost struggled with service towards the end. If you're coming with a large party, I would highly encourage arriving early and making your life easier by taking advantage of reservations.\\n\\nOur server patiently described the menu to our party and answered all our questions. Their lunch special is a great deal and I would come back just for it. For $10, choose from a variety of dishes that mirror the dinner menu but just a smaller serving. Each dish comes with your choice of jasmine rice or rice and peas, chop suey (cabbage), plantains, and a tea or soft drink. What a deal, especially in midtown. I ordered the jerk chicken and the chicken is seasoned very well with a mild kick, robust sauce, and has a soft, fall-off-the-bone texture. Very delicious! The rice was also seasoned well, although a bit dry. My coworker commented that everything else on the plate--the chop suey and plantains, were not warm and I think it was probably due to either their haste in preparing all of our dishes or inexperience in the kitchen. Not having my food piping hot isn't a deal breaker to me, and I'd gladly return because the chicken is truly that good.\\n\\nService was slow at the end, but again, probably because they were overstaffed. We were still served with smiles and everyone was very friendly towards the group. You can't beat a $10 sit-down lunch in midtown, especially when the food is good! I'm a fan."},{"name":"Pasta Da Pulcinella","address":"1123 Peachtree Walk NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great service, perfect setting...we ate outside, and excellent food.

It's only $0.99 for a 16 oz. iced coffee! For iced coffee! That's actually good! Although it probably has a lot of sugar in it. The bathrooms are very clean and modern. However, the service here is mediocre. This is because they have six registers, but only two were open! There was a huge line of twenty people for two registers. Either get rid of those other registers or find people to work at those registers. WaWa was built on efficiency, so it should live up to that standard. Overall a great, amazing gas station.

I was hesitant, but knew I should give it a chance.\\n\\nAll in all, it was pretty good.  Tasty peps, plenty of cheese, and a nice sauce.  Our pizza was big, but not quite as filling as I would hope for.  The pizza was pretty thin and floppy - I found it easier to eat with a knife and fork.  Adding some of our homemade garlic butter dipping sauce really helped out the crust, which I found to be average.  The staff was very friendly and our pizza was ready on time.  By the time we got it home, we had to heat it up in the oven, but the pizza turned out great regardless.\\n\\nIf you know me at all, you know I am absolutely in love with Home Slice (I felt like an adulteress eating another place's pizza!).

I forgot Valentine's is one of those days you may get stuck with a prix fix menu. So my anticipation of grilled octopus, roasted brussel sprouts, and sea scallops was quickly shut down when I was handed the menu. Sean, our server, was excellent!!!  And Melinda, the hostess who got me in, was wonderful. We told him we wanted to substitute the first course with the salmon tacos. He instead was kind enough to get it as a side dish. They were as good as I remember. Light and crisp and a melody of complimentary flavors exploding in a taco unlike any other. I then started with the salmon tartare. It was pretty good but not as good as the tacos. Next I ordered the mix of wild mushrooms over an egg that was poached. The mushrooms were seasoned and had some slivers of onion in it that complimented the dish. The egg was runny as poached eggs are and did nothing for the rest of the dish in my opinion. The third course was a crusted salmon with chick peas. The chick peas were bland and had no other preparation that I was able to detect other than to serve as a side for the salmon. The salmon was cooked perfect, and had a nice flavor and tasted fresh. Lastl I had the chocolate and coffee pot de creme. It had a side of marscapone. Last time I was here the desserts were not good at all, but the pot de creme was terrific, rich with a subtle taste of coffee.  The waiter gave us a complimentary flute of champagne and gave my daughter some ice cream. She had a side of pappardelle pasta with butter for dinner. I have to say I was surprised that was $10 for a very small portion of pasta. I want to thank Melinda and Sean for taking care of us, and I'd like to thank Christian for helping fit us in and reaching out.

Joe by far is the only saving grace from this entire experience.  He recommended items on the menu, was enthusiastic, and very laid back.  He even threw in a free dessert just because.  Our food came and was ho hum, I would describe the pasta and goat cheese appetizer that I had as very similar to something I could get at the Olive Garden except for a much steeper price.  I will say my friend's salmon looked much better than my pasta and we had an artichoke and cheese appetizer that was heavenly!  Also, the check did recommend the veal, but after he described the marrow as meat jello I couldn't bring myself to order it.  I guess that would appeal to some people!  As our meal came to a close we wanted another glass of wine and to order dessert.  We could quite literally see our server David flirting with the hostess and playing catch in the stairwell as we waited at least 30 minutes.  Then he came up to check on us and said, \\"sorry about the wait, so busy, up and down, up and down\\", I mean really guy?! we can SEE you!

The chips are always fresh and hot, the salsa is mouthwatering, and unlike any other. \\n\\nMy entree of choice is the Chicken Burro: a delicious flour tortilla stuffed with juicy marinated chicken, topped with flavorful enchilada sauce and a gratuitous helping of melted cheese. It's served with either Jambalaya or Rice and black beans. Both are delicious, just a matter of preference. \\n\\nThe margaritas are absolutely to die for: I prefer the strawberry because most margaritas in general are too sour for my liking.\\n\\nThe waitstaff here are ALWAYS prompt, professional, knowledgable, and super friendly.

Afterwards we decided to wander over, it was around dinner time and we at least were looking for a place to get a bite to eat and drink. As we debating going in/trying to figure out if it was even open yet, a couple came out and told us to not even think, just go! They said dinner was fantastic and the place had just opened that Thursday, but they weren't announcing their opening to avoid a rush and overwhelming the staff. Already, I am won over with that statement!\\n\\nSo we went in, and I was overwhelmed with how beautiful everything is. From the host/hostess stand, to the light fixtures and the painted walls, the immense space felt cozy. We were seated immediately and given a chance to look over the menu. It was pricy, as someone else has written, no entree is under $20 and appetizers are all over $12. But based on the descriptions, the prices seemed fair for what the food was. They have a small but well rounded tap list for beers, and a very extensive wine list. It wasn't till later in the evening that I found out they were on tap as well! This explained the prices for 2.5 oz, 5 oz, and I think 12.5 oz. servings. My boyfriend tried Pretty Things Fluffy White Rabbit and later in the evening was even given a sample of another beer before committing to ordering it. For $9.50, I picked a 5 oz of Troublemaker, and California red blend. It tasted very fresh on tap!\\n\\nOur server, Meredith, who also works at the Beehive, was excellent! As was our meals of apple and bacon stuffed pork loin on cider braised red cabbage for me and chicken piccata with gnocchi for him. I love when I go to restaurant and get a meal that I know I couldn't recreate at home. The pork was just that good.\\n\\nIt was definitely an unexpectedly nice dinner out, and our bill reflected that, but I will definitely come back!

Not only did they sing happy birthday to me, they also presented me with an autographed copy of their newest album AND invited me out to the van at break time for a, uh, hand-rolled \\"cigarette\\".  I never ate any food there, I only drank beers.\\n\\nAll of that considered, it's easy to recommend Zuffy's Place.  The atmosphere and the building are way better than the original, so I don't feel sad about the change of venue.  Their calamari appetizer is affordable, delicious, and not overly chewy.  The turkey sandwich with crawfish tails is crave-able.  Their wings rival a certain \\"taco\\" joint's, which is nice since the closest one of those is at Lindbergh.\\n\\nMy only complaint about dining at Zuffy's is that it is, in fact, a bar, so smoking is allowed inside.  I wouldn't mind if I just went there to drink, but when you're trying to eat it can be kind of a turn-off.  They have a late night menu, but as is expected it consists primarily of fried things.  They only serve their fried pickles after 11 pm, and those alone are worth a visit, though I don't know if they're worth the guilt.  Bands are scheduled quite a few nights a week, and while I enjoy music, not all of the bands are good and most are incredibly loud.\\n\\nAs long as you are prepared to have your clothes smell like smoke and aren't expecting to have a deep conversation, Zuffy's is a great place to grab some food and a couple beers."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I ended up having dinner here after noticing the Sushi place we planned on going to was not open until 6.\\n\\nThe waitress was fair at best.

Yesterday we went again for brunch and were disappointed. I had a reservation on open table, and upon arriving and checking in (on time I may add), the hostess told me there was no reservation under my name. I showed her the reservation confirmation on my phone, and she said she couldn't find it so it must have not gone through. She then looked further into it after showing her again the confirmation on my open table app and email and she said I had already check in and my party was already seated, so then asked me if was I joining the party that's already here! I calmly told her I'm clearly standing here right now checking in, no I'm not here with anyone else, the party of 4 is right here and she said someone else with my same exact first and last name (which is NOT a common name at all so I doubt it) must have also had a reservation at the same time so they were seated under my name. She did not apologize and stated we could be added to the wait list which would be about 30 minutes for a table of 4. Only after saying we need to speak to her manager were we then offered the next open table instead of being placed on the bottom of the waitlist and weren't even offered as much as an apology for giving away our reservation so carelessly and making up a story about how someone had the same exact name as me, let alone give us anything while we were waiting. Not even a free biscuit... Very unprofessional and rude. The food this time around was also disappointing as they had changed their menu from what was posted online and there was only 1 breakfast option that didn't have pork in it (the griddle cakes), so I ended up getting something from the lunch menu.

Service was genuine throughout the meal, fast and courteous and you could tell they genuinely wanted us to enjoy our night.  \\n\\nNext, They brought over some bread. Now, I have to admit, I haven't been to a portuguese restaurant in a very long time, but this bread tasted old, like really stale.  I dipped in the garlic olive oil sauce they had brought (which was fantastic, btw), and the bread was totally edible, just didn't taste fresh for me.  Maybe this is how they intend it to be so that when you dip it in the olive oil it soaks up all the deliciousness.  They also brought over some pitted olives, which were very good.  We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer, again, it was totally edible, just bland and no wow factor.  Also, it said \\"calamari with hot peppers\\" in the description on the menu, which really meant \\"I'm going to cut up two yellow peppers and put them on this plate for you.\\"   Then we ordered a chicken dish to split, again, totally edible, just nothing great about it.  \\n\\nThen we ordered dessert, this is where the wow factor was.  We ordered some passion-fruit mousse something and she thought we ordered two, when we had ordered one to split, she graciously took the extra one back, no problem.  We tried the dessert, and WOW!   I think there was some booze in it too, absolutely delicious.\\n\\n  We also ordered a cappuccino.  When it came, there was some cinnamon sprinkled on top.  Now while I love cinnamon in my cappuccino, A is unfortunately allergic and we had to send it back.  Again, they were very gracious and not at all upset.

My bowl of Pho Tai was  only $1 more than it is at Triple 888. I was given a massive bowl of soup. The basil was fresh and smelled great. The bean sprouts were okay. I wasn't given enough lime, but I could have asked for more. Our waitress was very friendly, if air headed. \\n\\nThe food was good, but not great. It was very mild in flavor compared to China Town or Triple 888. It was however, more balanced. The spring roll in our bun was awesome. The bun was missing something in it's flavor. Next time I'll skip the bun and just get an order of spring rolls. The dumplings in my partner's soup were a tad over done but tasty. Everything tasted super fresh and crisp. The noodles were perfect. \\n\\nWe'll be back to support this place, because the north shore needs more places like this- clean with fresh food cooked to order. \\n\\nI am torn between 3 and 4 stars for this place. they get the extra star for being super clean and the great customer service."},{"name":"Zuffy's Place","address":"1860 Corporate Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"A great place to have a few drinks with friends and listen to live music.

I never had any issues at the Zaftig's in Brookline, but I have had horrible experiences at the Natick location. Today, my boyfriend and I went for lunch, and I had the Lincoln wrap, and he had the stuffed French toast. I asked for no tomato, and got diced tomatoes that I couldn't pick out, not a huge deal, but just inconvenient. But my French fries were severely undercooked and were ice cold, and and while I was still chewing my food, the waiter came and took my food away and asked as he was holding my plate of food if I was all done. My boyfriend got through half of his stuffed French toast and it was completely FROZEN inside, to the point where he couldn't eat it because he was chewing banana flavored ice on the inside. We told the waiter about the French toast, and he offered to take it off the bill. The best part was that there was a couple next to us, and the girl ordered a black bean burger and she only took two bites out of it because it was cold, and not cooked. I guess it is a common trend to serve cold undercooked food. We won't be going back to the Natick location again, and it has convinced me to maybe not even return to the Brookline location."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Came here on a Monday night and the place had a 40 minute wait!

Really, a lot, more than is wise. And while I love some places, rarely am I completely blown away. \\n\\nI am completely blown away by Tasty and Sons, if I could give more stars I would.\\n\\nThe space is great, large and open, but somehow not deafeningly loud as so many industrial spaces can be. I am a big fan of bars that overlook open kitchens and if I ever get a chance to visit sans kiddo, that is where I will ask to sit. Ringside for the drama.\\n\\nThe food is the real star, it is sad, but I think Matt and I will have to go many more times to work our way through everything on their tapas-for-brunch style menu.  I recommend going in a group so that you can taste a variety of dishes, and don't be afraid to order adventurously. This is one of those restaurants where you peer at neighboring tables and say, \\"Look at that, next time...\\" What we had:\\n\\nPotatoes Bravas:  They bring out your food staggered, which is great because you get to appreciate each dish on its own merits. This was the first one to hit out table. In a searing hot skillet large chunks of seasoned potatoes and an amazing aioli-type sauce that had a lovely garlic tang, all topped with two perfect over-easy eggs. There is salt and pepper on the table, but you don't need it, cause these dishes are seasoned .Win.\\n\\nAsparagus Omelet: We didn't actually order this, but due a mistake it was delivered to our table. When we pointed this out, our waitress apologized and then said to go ahead and have it on the house. Nice.\\nThe omelet was perfection, light and airy eggs wrapped around aspargus, white sausage and Dijon. While our daughter ate most of the sausage, the combo of eggs and asparagus was win.\\n\\nNorth African Sausage: My husband spent a lot of time in Morocco in his twenties, and this dish tasted like he was there again. The lamb sausage is subtley spices and delicious. I was a fan of the savory couscous underneath, with its rich flavor and texture.  Win.\\n\\nFrench Toast: Half order was great because of how rich this dish was. Really sweet but the cream adds great depth. Win.\\n\\nChocolate Potato Donut: They forgot a word here on the menu, and that is Hole. This is the size of a donut hole. Which for $2 was disappointing, even though the donut itself was hot with a great chocolaty taste, not too sweet. Not win, due to the price/size ratio.\\n\\nSmoked Tasso Hash. We are so stuffed, we can't even make a respectable showing on this dish., but the ham I tried was amazingly tender and smoky. The greens on this dish are amazing, no bitter taste at all. I could eat a mountain of them alone.\\n\\nAll in all, amazing.

I seriously debated even writing a review for that reason.  BUT, they'll sub tofu for any meat for no extra charge!  So they get serious bonus points for that.  Unfortunately, their tofu is a bit lacking.  It's not pressed or dense and doesn't seem to be seasoned like the meats.  I won't fault them too much on that since I might be the only one who subs tofu so I can't expect them to have marinated tofu lying around all the time.  \\n\\nThey have inventive tacos with different meats and styles (chicken al pastor with pineapples or tandoori chicken for example).  The fried yuca is amazing, but I definitely ate too many and felt sick later so be warned: you'll want to eat them forever but definitely don't.\\n\\nFinally, they have a great outdoor area with several tables, umbrellas, and bistro lights overhead.

When our food arrived, it was highly disappointing.  I had the pork belly torta which was absolutely disgusting.  It was like taking a bite into a bucket of lard.   I know pork belly is fatty, but there was no meat, it was 100% fat.  My husband, a self-proclaimed connoisseur of pork, literally gagged when he took a bite of my sandwich.

This place just makes me sad.  And kind-of angry.  I obviously should have listened to the other reviews, but since I'm staying in the hotel and its too dark to walk around when I don't know where I'm going, I decided this place was at least cheaper than room service, so I gave it a shot.  \\n\\nI called for take out, and they said it would be 10-15 minutes.  I arrived there about 20 minutes later, and was ignored for about 5 minutes.  Then the bartenders looked at me as though they were embarrassed that I had to wait, and talked to each other while looking at me.  Helpful.  Finally someone came over and told me that the kitchen was \\"backed up\\".  This was about 30 minutes after I placed my order.  Really?  Another 5 minutes pass, more talking in hushed tones while looking at me ensues.  I am offered a drink, I get water.  5 more minutes.  Now I'm just mad.  Finally, 45 minutes after I placed my order, I get my food.  Thankfully, all of the hushed talking must have accomplished something, because the onion soup I ordered was taken off my bill.  I appreciated that, because I didn't want to be overly rude, but at that point I was going to demand a discount.    So I left no longer angry.\\n\\nFast forward to me in my room, excitedly opening my food because I am starving. I ordered onion soup, and fish and chips.  The \\"guiness onion soup\\" is essentially canned onion soup with a slice of bread and cheese on top.  Lukewarm at best.  Not edible at all.  Awesome.  Oh well, I think, at least it was free.  \\n\\nI open up the fish and chips.  Those are hard to screw up, so I still have hope.  I see a huge mess of grease.  I have one giant piece of fish, also lukewarm.  There is a puddle of grease under it.  I try to pick it up and all the skin falls off because its soggy with grease.  They can't be serious.  I end up eating the actual fish and pulling off all the gross soggy skin.  The fish itself was edible.  The fries would have been good had they not also been victims of the greasy pile that was my fish.  I wiped off the bottom ones to salvage them, and ate the rest.  \\n\\nThis was, by far, one of the worst excuses for a meal I've ever had.  At 17$, the fish and chips were laughable.  At 7$, the onion soup was plain insulting.  \\n\\nAt least the bartender was nice enough to take the soup off my bill, otherwise I'd likely go find someone and complain.  \\n\\nI know some people write angry reviews no matter where they go, but I never do.  This was just too terrible of an experience to ignore.  \\n\\nMaybe as a bar its ok. Maybe the alcoholic drinks are good.  But avoid the food at all costs, and never take their time estimates seriously.  Really, I'd just avoid this place altogether.  I would rather have paid double for room service.

On a nice day this is the place to be, sitting in the sun and enjoying some great beer.  It is family and dog friendly.\\n\\nJK used to only have tours on Saturday afternoons and it was $10 to get it and you got 8 or so samples - all JK except for two guest kegs.  Now, they have a tasting room open Friday night, Saturdays and Sundays.  The only downside to this is when it's really busy, it can take 2-30 minutes to get a beer.  I suggest getting more than one beer when you get to the bar/table if that's the case.  Now that you don't pay for the samples at the door, you can either pay as you get pours or keep a tab open.  While they take credit cards, having cash makes the process go a bit quicker.\\n\\nThey also have a lot more than two guest kegs now; they carry a selection of beers from great breweries like Prairie, Elevation, To Ol and BFM.  When we were there last, i got to try Prairie Bomb!, Bierre del Borgo's Rubus Con Lamponi and To Ol's Black Maria on draft.  If you are new to sours, the Rubus Con Lamponi is a great place to start as it's not too tart.  They also offer it in bottle.\\n\\nAs for JK's beers, my favorites are Atrial Rubicite, Funk Metal and Ambree.  If you are looking for a lighter beer, their La Vie en Rose is pretty good although I wish it had a more pronounced raspberry flavor.  There aren't many I don't like truth be told.

Great mix of sweet and spicy. Th downstairs seating area was very nice, and the outside beer garden looked nice as well. If only they could get some German beers with their great selection of local beers! The New York Board was out of this world.

Since I somehow never made my way into Migz, I think I can look at this place with a bit of a different light. However, I didn't view it much differently. The place, on the whole, disappointed me.\\n\\nIt's not terrible by any means, it's just not great either, which it should strive to be in a city teeming with restaurants and pubs. They serve general pub food (sandwiches, burgers, etc.). They had a decent drink special of $10 off of any bottle of wine, regardless if you bought their cheapest or their most expensive. But, of course, the wine is marked up quite a bit on the menu. \\n\\nI chose to keep it simple (and cheaper), and just order their hot beef sandwich. It was adequate, fries that accompanied were good. The portion was of a healthy size, but the taste was nothing to write home about. \\n\\nThe d√©cor is pretty nice for a casual sports bar, with sufficient TV coverage around the entire venue. \\n\\nService was adequate at best. Our waitress was friendly enough, but once our food was delivered, we were rarely visited and it was difficult to get her attention if we ever needed anything. It is great to be left alone to enjoy your meal, but not abandoned. The restaurant was almost empty, and our waitress was sitting at the bar multiple times. \\n\\nThe only thing that truly irked me was that they failed to make it known that they have limitations to their payment methods until we were ready to pay the bill. They do accept both cash and credit, but nowhere in the restaurant did it say you couldn't use debit nor were we told by the waitress so we had all smacked down our debit cards to pay. We were informed that there is an ATM in the building, but of course that would charge me probably at least $2.00 to use. It's not a huge deal, but if you're going to limit your payment methods you should really make it known.  They did provide us with the famous $10 coupon as an apology for the inconvenience. \\n\\nWith a bit of work and a bit more attentive service, it could probably be a good sports location in Kits. \\n\\nOne true positive: they were playing great music all night long."},{"name":"Pasta Da Pulcinella","address":"1123 Peachtree Walk NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"With all the great reviews on yelp, we decided to try this place out.

The reviews rave, the menu was wonderful, the location pretty and homey .... but, it was awful.  We both had ravioli and almost had to ask for a steak knife to eat them.

My boyfriend actually took me here as a surprise treat for our anniversary dinner, and surprised I was to learn that: \\n\\n1) Beast only has two seatings per night (one at 6 PM, and the other at 8:45 PM,) so don't show up half an hour early like we did. The restaurant has no waiting area inside, and the only place in the neighborhood where you can pass time seems to be Beast's sister bar across the street, which was loud and expensive and plain not worth it. My bf and I opted to wait it out in the car.\\n\\n2) Seating is communal, meaning there are two long tables that fit a total of ~20 guests. The idea is for you to bond with your fellow foodies, but they do seat you directly next to the dining partner you came with (not across) to make it easier for private conversation as well.\\n\\n3) The menu is set and changes every couple weeks. This was, in my opinion, the best part, because I hate choosing, and it takes a certain level of confidence for a restaurant to offer a set menu. To me, it says, \\"Don't worry. We know what we're doing and we do it well, so sit back and relax and enjoy.\\"\\n\\nAnd on the one hand, I must say I really did enjoy the dining at Beast, if only for the novelty of it all. The service was gracious; the presentation, beautiful; and the wine pairing, on point. The whole affair felt like a very intimate celebration of food and cooking (you can literally see into the kitchen and watch the chefs plating each course) and the enjoyment of food with good company.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I can't help but feel like the whole thing was a little gimmicky and over-hyped. For one, I didn't get much from sharing a table with others. Maybe it was because everyone at our table was on a date, and the seating actually made it harder for me to hear my own date above the rest of the noise. Or maybe it was because I hail from Los Angeles, where every gimmick in the book has been tried and done, so the whole concept failed to impress me enough for me to overlook the flaws in the actual meal. Of the six courses, I would say only half were truly standout dishes. The rest were a forgettable blur of fancy sounding names and superfluous ingredients. Personally, as a fervent cheese lover, I was especially disappointed in the cheese dish, whose flavors I felt did not particularly complement one another.\\n\\nOverall, a unique and pleasant dining experience, but for the price point and all the flourishes, I must say I expected a little more.

I just stick to their signature dish, because that's what they're best at. I find that one order can feed two people reasonably, though I have finished ones on my own before too. For most of 2007 I was vegetarian, and the muquecas are one of the things I missed most. It wasn't until I started eating seafood again that I went back and found out they can do vegetarian versions. Good to know! I took my seafood-averse boyfriend there, and he ordered a meat extravaganza that could probably have fed three people. He ate it all, and I think we skipped dinner that evening.\\n\\nWhen I was scouting out places to live before I moved to Boston, Muqueca was one of the first places I came, completely be accident. A friend had suggested East Coast Grill, which was way out of my planned price range, so my mom and I wandered and tried this place on a whim. Good thing, too, because if that hadn't happened, I don't know how I would ever have found out about it. It's not a place that anyone mentions, oddly.\\n\\nI find the appetizers are a bit hit and miss, and the drinks sound better than they taste -- they're a bit watery.

The meat was plentiful and the sauce was excellent.  The bread was not great-I wish it had been toasted but overall, very good.  The slaw is my FAVORITE, I could eat it all day long.  The maduros, good.\\n\\nThe full rack was fall off the bone tender.  My husband enjoyed it.  The spicy sauce requested on the side was excellent.  He took meat home and I can tell you, it was even good cold.\\n\\nMy son had a pork sandwich and fries.  He wanted nothing to do with the sandwich but loved the fries.  The sandwich was good; the bread was not the normal hamburger bun you find at other places--so flavorful.\\n\\nThe second meal- I had another sandwich- it was the Banh Mi.  Wow, just enough kick and excellent.  The bread this time was very good. I had the slaw and of course, it was awesome!  I did get the corn on the cob (hoping my son would eat some).  He did not but I did.  Very good!\\n\\nMy husband went with two sandwiches, a pork and a brisket.  He said both were great.  He remarked they were better than 4 Rivers.

A couple friends and I came here a few weeks ago just for drinks, resisting the tempting tapas menu since we had already had dinner.  After being ID'ed by the bouncer, we were asked if we would prefer to be seated in Bistro Chi or the Kama Lounge...we chose the latter.  Although we were able to grab seats right away, we found the furniture to be a little bit strange.  The set up of the lounge is small, with three chairs per the 4-5 small (side?) tables.  The chairs are set low, and I thought it was awkward to be so close to the floor, hunched over.  \\n\\nWhen we were settled in, a server came over right away to take our drink orders.  She was really friendly and helpful.  When serving our drinks, one of her necklaces actually slipped into my friend's drink, and she immediately apologized and had the bartender make a duplicate drink.  I thought it was nice of her to act so quickly; we didn't even have time to complain about it before she offerred to return with a fresh replacement.  All of our drinks were ordered off the cocktail menu, and they were well-mixed.  The cocktails we ordered were roughly the same price, $8-9 each.  The glasses of house wine we had next were $6 each; other wines were about $2-3 more per glass.  \\n\\nAlthough their service and drinks were good, I will probably not return to Kama.  It didn't stand out to me as a really special place.  Also, there seemed to be a high number of men in the lounge...After the first hour we were there, the three of us were the only females in the restaurant (beside for the bartender and waitresses).

My hubby and Liz C., who is not only game for new food quests, but also for challenges such as keeping one's parents entertained, accompanied us, as well.  My second outing was just as good, if not better.  \\n\\nThe Spaghettoni Aglio e Olio con Gamberi (spaghetti-like pasta with shrimp, red chile, carmelized garlic, and parsley) inspires me to swear off Atkins forever.  Now THIS is some good pasta.  The Gnocchi is perfectly tender, and that sage brown butter it is served in makes me swoon.  I've also tried the Antipasti Misto and the Caesar salad, both of which were outstanding.  And that appetizer with the fried calamari, shrimp, artichoke, and lemon slices in basil aioli?  Fantastic.  I especially loved the unexpected addition of the fried lemon in the mix.   We also sampled one of their desserts, a tart with macadamia nuts and white chocolate that was to die for.  There was not a single thing I put in my mouth during either of the two meals (and I was poaching off everyone's plates) that I didn't think was truly fantastic.\\n\\nThe decor is modern and beautifully done - whoever likened it to the Galaxy Cafe hit the nail on the head.  Clean lines, dark wood furniture, all complimented by a healthy dose of natural light from the large windows looking out onto 11th Street.  It does get a little loud in here, though, due to the concrete floors and lack of any kind of sound-absorbing material anywhere.  \\n\\nYou order at the counter, but the service is still extremely attentive; they bring your food to your table and are prompt about refilling your drinks and clearing away plates.  All the employees are cheerful, helpful, and all seem genuinely happy to be there.

Our server apologized profusely, explaining that they make the sauces fresh daily, so they vary somewhat from day to day and from chef to chef.  She very cheerfully and quickly brought me something else, the fettucine alfredo, which somehow managed to be light (the sauce is not very creamy, but I loved it) and the texture of the fettucine was absolutely perfect.

But they do provide throws at every table to wrap yourself in for when it gets a little chilly.  \\n\\nWe had the red coconut curry mussels. Oh man. So good! We just wished it came with bread to soak up the extra sauce instead of French fries. For dinner I got the Linguine Vongole. So amazing. It has clams In a butter and white wine sauce.

My friend got the CBC (Butter chicken) She said it was good but a little too tart from the yogurt.\\n\\nThey have many craft cocktails.

Never been a donut fan, especially when donuts are invariably loaded with some scary thick icing no matter where you go:  Tim Hortons, Krispy Kreme and bakery sections of grocery stores, etc.  The selection here was 90% donuts, the remainder being croissants, which I usually avoid getting as much as possible.  Since I was already there, and given all the rave reviews, might as well try it out.    \\n\\nThe old fashioned donut was the best I have ever had to date -- thin coat of icing, just enough to give it the perfect amount of sweetness.  Exactly how I like it.   Texture of the dough was superior to anything else I have had so far, in my donut experience to date.  It had this enjoyable buttery aroma to it without any nauseating lardiness that characterizes the Krispy Kreme product.  The best thing was that the dough had some great bounce to give it some bite, unlike the dry crumbly stuff from Timmy Ho's.  People also rave about Voodoo, but Voodoo's donuts are more of the cake variety, which is different from Lucky's, much sweeter, and many weird flavours and chemicals.  I'd say Lucky's gets my vote.\\n\\nStill don't love their coffee though, for the same reasons that stopped me from returning to their Kits location some years ago.  Practically all the blends listed on their menu were acidic -- not my preference.  Asked the counter staff to recommend something low acid.  Unfortunately it was anything but.

You can order as little as one or as much as 20.  As you can see from this picture, we ordered 2  pieces of a dynamite roll. This is exactly what we received. They had served us two pieces like we asked but both were falling apart and stacked up on each other. The other sushi we had received looked a lot like the piece on the right; loose with the fillings seperate from the nori and rice. But this, was absolutely not acceptable. \\nThe first item that we had received at the restaurant was a plate of 5 gyozas. It came to our table cold. We had the server take it back saying it was cold. She was very polite and brought it back. We looked at the plate again and the 4 gyozas (minus the one we had taken a bite out of,) was back but stuck to each other. It had obviously been microwaved. We couldnt rip apart the gyozas without tearing their skin. We took another bite and the taste was off. I don't know if it was just that it tasted bad or if the food had gone bad. Either way, we did not finish it. \\nMy brother had if the \\"seafood tempura\\" selection on the menu was a shrimp. The waiter answered it was not and that it was a fish.

We left the restaurant. \\nThe price for the lunch all you can eat was $14.50 per person. In my opinion, for what we got, this was definitely not worth the amount we paid.

That's what I call this place.  \\n\\nThe experience starts with standing in a lengthy line (sometimes out the door) with a horde of the hungry denizens of Beaverton - all thirsting for a burger that reminds them of distant home lands (California) or even mom's kitchen table.\\n\\nNo less than a dozen workers coordinate in an assembly line process that would make Henry Ford jealous in order to efficiently construct the burger that you just ordered.  They call out your assigned number at the counter once they have completed your custom masterpiece and you're forced to meander and pick your way through other guests and furniture strewn about to claim your newfound gastrointestinal treat.\\n\\nThe ambiance is basically strip mall hell with cheap tables and chairs crammed together on a concrete floor.  Signs highlighting the good reviews that Five Guys have received cover up the windows in a vain attempt to hide the mediocrity of Beaverton from the patrons.  This flagrant display of interior ad copy seems out of place - as if you aren't about to discover for yourself exactly what the burgers taste like in just a few, short moments.\\n\\nWhat this restaurant lacks in sophistication is more than compensated for by the visceral assault of pure juicy carnivorous delight.  There are nothing but burgers and hot dogs on this menu - save for a token veggie sandwich to appease our vegetarian friends.  However, the customization available for each burger ensures that everyone comes away happy.  Besides the standards like grilled onions and grilled mushrooms, go ahead and splurge with a little bit of A-1 and hot sauce.\\n\\nThe buns have a home-style flair to them and the toppings are fresh.  The patties (two if you order the standard burger) are thick and juicy.\\n \\nThe fries demonstrate exactly what is wrong with the limp, greasy fries of Oregon's native sons (McMenamins and Burgerville) - they are crisp on the outside, soft on the inside and well seasoned.\\n\\nThese burgers occupy an interesting niche - positioned between fast food burgers and chain restaurant burgers.   Their quality is definitely superior to the average fast food burger, but is slower and more expensive as well.   Their burgers are almost equivalent in the taste department to a Red Robin or Ruby Tuesday's burger, but sans the customer service, food presentation (Five Guys food is presented in a paper bag) or nice eating area. \\n\\nGo ahead and split a large fry as there should be plenty for a couple.\\n\\nAny comparisons to In-And-Out burger are misguided - Five Guys have their own burger that is able to survive the taste test on its own merits."},{"name":"McKay's Breakfast and Lunch","address":"144 Franklin St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Wow just a gem!

We've had Salt/Caramel ice creams where it really was salt ice cream with a hint of caramel.  This was the opposite.  The caramel definitely steals the show here, and there's just enough salt in there to support it.  PERFECT.  \\n\\nI tasted their \\"Hopworks ESB with Butterscotch Bread Pudding\\" (yep, a bitter beer flavored ice cream!) and their Rosewater with Saffron and Pistachio, and determined neither was my thing.  Both were great, just great for someone else's palate.  We tried their Lemon Basil Sorbet, and both felt it had good potential but tasted like Basil with a bit of lemon.  We'd have liked to have tasted lemon with the support of some basil.  We both thought the Pear with Bleu Cheese was very good---I may have a bowl of that next time.\\n\\nI finally settled on the Honey Balsamic Strawberry with Cracked Pepper, which is far and away the finest Strawberry I've ever had--it wasn't peppery--there was just a supporting hint of pepper in it.  My daughter wound up with the Cinammon Snickerdoodle and it's now her new favorite ice cream.  My son had their Stumptown Coffee with Cocoa Nibs and loved it. \\n\\n$3.75 a scoop, add a buck for a home-made basic cone (which all agreed were also great).  Not your cheapest ice cream place, but really $15 for ice cream for four isn't that bad. \\n\\nWe drove from Forest Grove (30 miles) and it was worth every mile of the drive.

This one was tastier than the red. I recommend this definitely. Our food arrives. We order 2 tequila shots. I have the tacos with pork. They were tasty, but I felt they were dry. I didn't have any of the salsa or sour cream either. We ordered a quesadilla to share and he had Robert's Favorito. He devoured it and claimed it delicious. We were given (by accident) the quesadilla plate, not the app. We were too full to even eat it! When we mentioned this to her, she made sure we were charged appropriately. After all of that food and drink, we were sufficiently full and happy. Good thing it was a long walk home so I could digest and work some of it off!

This is my current candidate for best breakfast place in PDX. You'll want to be in the mood for savory breakfast though because that is the bulk of the menu. This it not to say the scones, etc. don't look great. I didn't see any pancakes though so if that is what you're after you may want to look elsewhere.\\n\\nI started with a mimosa as a starter since I'd just finished a long run and couldn't think of a better way to start breakfast than to celebrate! The mimosa was a really nice balance of OJ to sparkler. They also serve you a itty bitty little \\"welcome scone\\" as a starter which just about made my day because not only was it really good, it's just shows great hospitality! I ordered Another Slider Roll which is made up of scrambled eggs, house made breakfast sausage and hollandaise on two little toasted brioche rolls. It comes with a potato rosti. I subbed bacon because I had to check out their bacon since it is one of my favorite foods. This was an amazing meal: great creamy hollandaise, yummy brioche rolls toasted so slightly, and the bacon had a really nice cured meat flavor, not just smoky like a lot of bacon. The rosti were perfect. It's a nice round of hash brown potatoes that seem to be pre-roasted a bit and then finished on the flat grill so that the outsides are perfectly brown. Toast makes their own hot sauce and I highly recommend this on both the eggs and the rosti to give a gentle little kick. \\n\\nI sat at the counter being solo and had some of the best service I've had in PDX. It was just the right level of friendly, attentive, and not checking in too often. This place really pays attention to detail and as a former chef, I appreciate that. It was busy but my food came up in a reasonable amount of time. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items.

A 4 seems generous, so a 3 it is. The food is decent, but not super good or memorable. The highlight seems to be the curry chicken with roti. Its tasty, but nothing special, and I've had the same dish as an appetizer at many Burmese restaurants back home. The portion size is kind of small as they give you one piece of thigh meat chicken with a piece of bread. I would advise adding on some rice (or if you're a fried chicken fan you can add on a wing for $3). We tried a few extra entrees the last time we went and were super disappointed. The khao yum (literally a rice salad) felt lazy. There was rice thrown in with cucumbers and bean sprouts- super weird. The southern thai ground pork was inedible, as it was hot as balls. This was coming from a group who can handle some spice. Drinks are tasty. The coconut mango horchata and ginger cider are both solid. I think this makes for a better lunch spot, as the meal is not very satisfying as far as dinner goes. \\n\\nFew logistics: There's limited seating inside and 4 tables outside, but the wait isn't overly cumbersome.

Don't get me wrong, when we first get here it's all good and the server is attentive but then after you put in your first drink order it goes down hill. The server doesn't come around to ask you for your meal order for like a half hour and when you try to flag someone down they say \\"we will let your waiter/waitress know\\" and that is an additional 10 min... total of 40 min wasted waiting. Once you get your good it's cold and yet you don't want to complain because of all the time wasted already. Not once did our waitress come by and we were sitting in the lounge area where they come by for drinks by the bloody bar. To wait for your bill is a whole ordeal and once you complain, nothing is resolved. They try to soften you up with a free dessert but in that moment you've wasted a solid hour or so of waiting for any good service that you don't want the dessert (cuz that's another 10 min of waiting) and to tip. Yeah I tip but for bad service, no way! Oh I love the excuse, \\"we are busy and have so much to do.\\" I'm sorry but I'm paying for a service and tip isn't mandatory so don't complain to me if I don't give you what 'you' want.

Great meal.\\nHere's a breakdown of the dishes I ate.  My apologies if I get something wrong.\\n\\nCheese plate:  This came with three cheeses.  A blue cheese that was top notch, creamy and pungent.  A 2-year smoked gouda, which actually tastes nothing like what you'd find in the store.  It had gritty crystals in it, more parmesean-like than the creamy texture I'm used to.  And a goat cheese, which was harder than the soft, creamy goat cheeses you'd find at a grocer.  All three were delicious.  This came with homemade applesauce, fig jam, and honeycomb, as well as bread and house made beer nuts.\\n\\nCharred edamame with pop rocks.  You heard me right.  Homemade pop rocks made with salt.  Very cool texture to add to the beans.\\n\\nRaw scallops with sorbet and cucumber.  Best scallop dish I've ever eaten.  The combination is a great mix of cool and warm, icy and silky, sweet and salty.\\n\\nPork cheek with fig jam, mustard, and toast.  Very tender.  The cheek alone is worth its weight in gold, and the combination is through the roof.  A must.\\n\\nOxtail on flatbread with mushrooms and blue cheese.  The blue cheese can be a bit much, but if the proportions are right, the oxtail is extremely succulent, it makes for a great dish.\\n\\nFoie gras and pork belly bahn \\"minis\\".  Very rich, but a smaller dish.  I hinted a sweet chili sauce that balanced out the savory ingredients.\\n\\nDessert:\\n\\nFoie \\"PB & J.\\"  Maybe the best dessert I've ever eaten.  The combination is amazing.  A pillowly, fluffy french toast with a foie mousse and some homemade jam, along with crunchy, crispy, peanut butter crackles that added nice texture.\\n\\nLemon panna cotta with beet sorbet and \\"thyme bomb\\".  The dish wasn't spectacular, if it wasn't for the beet sorbet.  Fantastic idea, and it pairs well with the thyme.\\n\\nThis restaurant could quickly climb the ladder to very top of Austin's eateries.

It's absurd because the place is so loud. There is simply no way a kid could be a disruption. It's deafening in there.

I haven't been to the museum in a while so was surprised that the side entrance was closed, so I took a long route outside and inside to get to the restaurant. The side benefit was seeing the art along the way. The decor is nice and there is view over the courtyard; although it's difficult to see at night. Wine by the glass was pricey.

How are we not getting more creative menus at these places? \\n\\nAs someone who tries to eat mostly plant-based, I was disappointed that almost none of the dishes could be easily adapted to a plant-based diet without removing over 50% of the components. This isn't a vegan establishment, I know, I know. But shouldn't concocting a vegan meal out of sandwiches, salads, and soup offerings be literally the easiest thing of all? It should, but there was dairy everywhere! Even the broccoli and cheese soup, while of course not vegan, was not even vegetarian! I cringe when places find the need to put animal products in things where they do not need to be for any purpose. \\"Add some bacon! Add some cheese\\" Ugh, stop!\\n\\nSince I am not religiously vegan, I went the vegetarian route with the veggie sandwich (nixed the dairy) and one of the two vegetarian soups: spinach and feta. My husband really liked his Deluxe pizza and my order tasted good too, hence the deserved 4 stars.\\n\\nHowever, I would love to see some improvements here to make the menu more inclusive and overall healthier for its customers: \\n\\n1) Include calorie counts on menu items.

I miss feeling triumphant when I guess right and get the little stamps of success on my card and brandishing that badge around for all to see how much a group of at least 10 can order. And most of all, I just miss the experience of seeing everything being steamed and cooked in front of us and the final swish and swash of soy sauce on our foods telling us it is time to dig in.\\n\\nNow, we just go from the starting point of checking off from a list of what we want to skipping the process of all the work and food making and just getting to the end point quickly, where all the dishes just land on our table in one go. The whole experience of dim sum is now lost in translation and all I get are dishes that look and feel dull and monotonous. I guess I appreciate my food more when I work for it and when I don't have the chance to, I just stuff it in my mouth not knowing what is going in.\\n\\nIn terms of quality, however, I feel that relatively most of the foods were decent, albeit sometimes too greasy or lacking in flavor. We ordered several  of our regular dishes, including the shrimp and chive dumplings, chicken feet, turnip cakes and rice cakes saut√©ed with bean sprouts, fried bean curd wrapped around bamboo shoots and mushrooms, siu mai, har gow, beef tripe and a few others.In addition to that I ordered for myself a serving of congee with lean pork and preserved duck egg, which I must say was just right.

The atmosphere is modern and trendy with a patio that can be utilized in the unlikely event the heat and humidity don't prevent you from sitting outside. The staple was supposedly the Pig Floyd Sandwich and it fell well short of expectation.  The sandwich has sausage, brisket, and pulled pork with a sweet Asian slaw and fries on a roll.  I rarely order conglomerate sandwiches because they never work.  This was no exception.  The taste of the slaw, fries and nondescript bun mask the taste of the scarce meat.  I had to pull the meat out to taste it or to see it because it wasn't piled high.  The sausage lacked flavor while the other two meats were good, but did not stand out.  The ribs were the best I have had in Central Florida,with great texture and the right consistency of smoke.  Here are the things that I found problematic:  1)  lousy sweat tea (possible Tetley or Lipton) 2) bizarre sides 3) unavailability of sauces. The fries are good but who wants yucca, plantains or mixed vegetables with BBQ?  Where are the collards or baked beans or macaroni and cheese? True BBQ eaters don't want she she sides.  They give you about a 2oz side of sauce with your order and you constantly have to bug a staff member to get more sauce.  As a result, you wind up eating the food dryer than you would have liked if the sauces are in bottles on the tables like in almost all BBQ joints.  If this is a cost cutting measure it's a shame because it is quite annoying.  The same hassle and gamesmanship is played with ketchup. They seem to have lots of funky stuff foreign to BBQ like tacos. I am not a huge fan of combined concepts; whenever I see a Chinese/Japanese or a Vietnamese/thai or the like I run. As they say, jack of all trades master of none.  BBQ is best served simple with an emphasis on the meat and lots of it. In that regard Pig Floyd's falls short. If it weren't for the ribs I probably wouldn't be back."},{"name":"La Fiesta Mexican Grill and Catering","address":"3000 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We have been trying to find a Mexican restaurant that made decent tamales.

When we first got there, it seemed like there was plenty of parking in the back, but after we left it was packed and people had to find street parking in the back. The menu itself was a mix of BBQ, Asian and Mexican. It was a little confusing at first since I was going in thinking it was strictly BBQ. The cashier was very helpful sorting through the menu, but when it's busy you feel rushed trying to make a decision so you don't lose a spot in line. \\n\\nI ordered the ribs while my wife got a platter that was BBQ/Asian that included pulled pork, rice, Asian sauce, egg roll, and Cole slaw. The food came out surprisingly fast and hot which I was very impressed with. I believe the manager on duty (lady with glasses and a nose ring)was the one who brought a plate out and she just plopped the plate down without saying a word or asking if this was for us, which my wife and I thought was kind of rude.\\n\\nThe food itself was very delicious. The ribs had a dry rub with tiny sauce which was a great combination. The Cole slaw was excellent. Portion sizes were good, and they needed to be for the price. The price isn't outrageous but more than if you went to a chain restaurant. \\n\\nIt was a cold night so the inside seating felt over crowded and very clustered. The line waiting to order is very close to the dinner seating which made you feel like people hovering over you. The kitchen is wide open to the eating area so you see what is going on, which can be off putting at times.\\n\\nOverall, the food was good even though it's confusing on what they want to be (BBQ, Asian, Mexican).

The waiter then offered fresh cracked black pepper and left us to eat. Delicious. One of the best bisques I have ever had and definitely the most unique. You have to try it to understand. Next came the bounty of crab claws, mustard sauce, and our sides. They bring you 11 medium claws at first then bring out refills of 4 claws at a time. Halfway through the initial set of claws, our waiter brought us a metal tin with hot towels and lemon slices to clean up between refills. Awesome! I'm pretty sure I got a large and a jumbo claw in one set of my refills but I could I have just been in crab coma at that point. After 4 refills, I was seeing stuffed so I went to the restroom to check it out and walk around a little. At this point we were the last table there and they were still extremely accommodating. The bathroom had a carafe full of mouthwash which I thought was hilarious and a nice touch. When I got back to my table, my date had the waiter being around the desserts. He ordered a key lime pie and I was just trying to figure out where I was going to put it...I was so full! We ended up slicing the huge slice of pie in half and splitting it, then taking the other half to go along with our sides. I just had the crab mac n cheese as I wrote this and it is phenomenal.

She was a very unfriendly and cold beginning that followed on with our check in, not a pleasant way to start your meal. \\n\\nWe waited more than 7 mins for the waitress to take drink orders, my fianc√© ordered a bottle of sparkly water and was asked if she wanted to drink it out of the bottle (we were not dressed down nor do we look like college kids) just bad judgement on the part of the waitress. When the water did show up, it was already opened. A  glass of wine showed up much later and was spoiled, a second glass was offered of the exact same spoiled wine.....three tries for a glass of drinkable wine. The beverages for the entire evening took way too long for a place that was less than full.\\n\\nWe ordered the mac/cheese with crab., a $6 up-charge..it was mostly cold with tiny slivers of crab, the several cheeses were like a soup and the bread crumb topping was also in short supply... the portion was super small making it an expensive dish. Clearly a dish prepared in advance, frozen and warmed before serving. \\n\\nFor our main she ordered the Tuna Sashimi Dinner.....the result was she enjoyed the lovely salad portion but the raw tuna went un touched (tasted old and not premium grade for this dish), the sad part is the waitress didn't notice nor asked why she didn't eat the tuna. I had the Portuguese Fish Stew....it was a large enough bowl of mostly a thick tomato soup (tasted out of a can) with little chourico and bits of old tasting fish, it too went mostly un touched, again the waitress never thought enough to ask why we didn't finish our meals. The food was a disappointment for a sea food resturant. \\n\\nThe service was spotty, our waitress was either too new or never trained to wait tables, she didn't remember the two specials did not keep on top of her customers.  We had to search her out every time we needed some attention.\\n\\nTo be fair, over all the place is nice but super noisy, no effort made to control the noise...some may find this charming, but when you have to shout to be heard at your own table maybe someone should look into it. The service is slow and un-attentive, the hostess was gruff and gave all the signs of not being happy with her job (the image was of someone's aunt....), parking was easy across the street, decorations in keeping with a drinking place, value for someone wanting large portions of comfort food, too bad; if the quality of the cooking and the food were better we would recommend it to others.

Tasty enough, but the veggies were cooked down to nothing. Not impressive. Rice and beans are standard fast-food/chain quality. Waitress is patient and on-the-spot. Its touristy-trappy, bright, and flashy. TIP: Mom is sensitive to spicy foods - this place is hard to call. The salsa was almost too hot for everyone at the table and there was some spicy spots in some of the entrees. So be careful if you have someone in your party that is sensitive.

I got the mini-crab cakes and my friend got the pizette(which is described as a small pizza) and her topping was sausage.  My mini-crab cakes were delicious!  They were basically crab cake balls and they give you about 7 and there was way more meat than filler, which is what I look for in a crab cake.  My friend's pizza was also good and for it to be on the small plate section of the menu, it was a good size.\\n  For my main course, I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp that is served with rice, black beans, and plantains.

Their produce has always been a ripoff price-wise, with upscale prices but not upscale quality of food.  \\n\\nTheir little festivities and parades are a really good idea in theory but the Sakura festival, their main event, has just been getting less and less as the years go by.  All the booths selling cool Japanese things and treats have been replaced by insurance kiosks and anime convention signups.  This year they didn't even have any food except the taiyaki which came with a 30-minute line.  Speaking of served food, the deli food is pricey and average.  All of their fried things are served cold or room temperature, and the deli seating is now cramped and dirty all the time.  See that TV up there?  It used to play Japanese TV all the time, so you could enjoy a little enka, rakugo, or Fuji news while you ate your nuked croquettes and ebifry.  No more!  I haven't seen it on in years.\\n\\nThis used to be my go-to Asian grocer when I first moved to Portland, but I hadn't been here in months until I came yesterday to fruitlessly search for a bento lunchbox to start taking to work.  I'm not sure if I just didn't know better then or there weren't as many options back then, but it was probably a mix of both.  There are just so many other Asian grocers in Portland that you can go to, so you don't need to go to Uwajimaya anymore and overspend for this stuff."},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"This has always been our favorite restaurant!!

The space is intimate, the chefs preparing your meal for you equally so, and the service is impeccable. The food is Pre-Fixe only and as it should be- you get roughly an 8 course meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied in terms of variety. The beer list here is minimal, but extremely thoughtful and paired so well with the food (the way all good beer lists should be). Almost every course was amazing, the standout taste of my evening was the Foie Gras bon bon, think Foie Gras Gelato is all I can say. All the Charcuterie was exceptional, that was maybe the highlight of all the plates/portion. The pork tenderloin entree was juicy and delicious. My only complaint was dessert. If I could give Beast 4.8 stars I would because their dessert was disastrous. It was a sort of apple tart tatin, but you could tell it was perhaps the only true \\"pre-fab\\" item on the table, it just seemed like no love went into. And the caramelized topping was overcooked so it congealed to the sides of the plate which was very annoying. But, this was only a small blip in an otherwise incredible dining experience.

He had just graduated from college, was working full time as a UPS driver, with literally no culinary experience. Today, he owns nearly 75 restaurants with his own line of hot sauces ranging from, \\"Ass Reaper,\\" to the hottest hot sauces in the world, \\"Smack my ass & Call me Sally.\\"  What started as a $30,000 investment, which $20,000 was borrowed from his parents, this restaurant made him over $200,000 in the first year and now makes over a million dollars in sales in that one store per year. \\n\\n          My visit to the restaurant of Tijuana Flats was on a recent weekend evening. As soon as I entered, my eyes immediately noticed their Hot Bar. This is not just an ordinary bar either; they have over fifteen sauces you could pick from. \\n\\n        I could almost instantly tell this is a Mexican restaurant; the lights are themed with Mexican colors, they even hand painted the ceilings giving it Mexican kick with images representing their culture and history. They also have a wall of appreciation, supporting children cancer foundations, local boy and girl scout camps, and dozens of positive reviews from local newspapers, school newspapers and organizations. \\nThey were playing this young, joyous music that almost made me dance to the ordering counter. Smelling the fresh made food was all that was on my mind; I did not know what to even order. \\n\\n         To begin, their appetizers definitely are not as appealing as the smell or the looks of the restaurant itself. But like almost all Mexican restaurants, they seem to always want to overindulge us with chips and salsa.  Their appetizers consisted of a variety of dips you could choose from. They have this amazing zesty hand made salsa, an irresistible queso in which you can also add fresh ground meat to spice up a bit and they also have the famous Tijuana Trio, which consists of salsa, queso, and guacamole. I have to admit, the salsa alone was so delicious, I was satisfied with that alone. \\n\\n          They have a wide selection of traditional Mexican dishes that left my mouth watered from the description of the meal itself. Every dish they offer sounds as good as it is described, customers were ordering everything off the menu; from the hand rolled toasted burritos, to huge, fresh and lightly fried chimichangas, to a delicious pile of fresh nachos indulged in cheese and fresh toppings, to even my favorite dish, enchiladas, which is filled and loaded with their very own chipotle red sauce and fabulously warm and melted cheese. \\n\\n           During my dining experience that evening, I chose to go with the chimichanga. The clerk surprised me when she asked if I wanted wheat or white, being that most Mexican restaurants rarely offer any healthy alternatives. Both burritos and chimichangas have three sizes you could pick from; I went with the middle size, which is called Tijuana size. As soon as they served my food, I couldn't believe how big chimichanga was. All I could think was, \\"I wonder how big the largest size is.\\"  It is easily shareable for two to even three diners. I walked over the Hot Bar and picked the famous and hottest sauce of all, \\" Smack my ass & call me Sally.\\" I took a bite into the mixture of the chimichanga and the sauce and I felt like a little child eating their favorite candy. I had sweat running down my forehead from how spicy the sauce was. The chimichanga was perfectly, lightly fried giving it an amazing texture when I bit into it. \\n\\n         The staff was friendly and welcoming, making the service pleasant. If you are looking for somewhere that's not expensive, that's fun, and has excellent food quality, and then Tijuana flats may be for you. Just make sure you enjoy spicy foods and prepare to spend no more than $20 for two on decent, cheap Mexican food."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"CRU 145 - 7155 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"2.5","text":"I havent been to BK for over a year but I had some coupons in the mail so i gave this new BK a try.

But what I don't understand is why they don't allow us the difference in price to upgrade to other menu items.  I would be trying new items weekly for a small cost and they'd be bringing in more cash from me.  Instead, the likely result at the end of the year will be they burned out 100 of their best customers on their classic sandwiches.

Now where do I start? My party and I went to Cino for the first time on a Sunday around 9:30 (30 minutes before they were scheduled to closed) and had the worst experience. First, they brought us the basket of tortilla chips and some sauce tasted like straight ass juice. Now typically when served tortilla chips, they are served with regular salsa. I don't know if they were trying to be different because they are relatively new but I would suggest that they stick to script. Secondly, we ordered lemonade and I questioned if I had actually ordered water. The lemonade had absolutely no lemon or ade. Thirdly, the queso was extremely disgusting. The queso had no taste what so ever. I was extremely excited to add the FIVE DOLLAR queso to my burrito to have only been completely let down. And finally, THE MEAT.. way to salty. I couldn't even finish my meal it was so overly salted. Now I've had some bad experiences but none worth making a Yelp account for. To conclude, I honestly would suggest that you all find somewhere to satisfy your taste for mexican food but if it's just in your spirit to eat at Cinco, I wouldn't suggest that anyone get a burrito of any sort. We asked for chicken and received both and chicken AND beef. Thank the Lord we weren't allergic.

This place is basically located in a food court with a few food stalls (?) where servers bring you food. \\n\\nMy go-to is the pork katsu curry over white rice.  I sometimes get the chicken katsu. The outside of the katsu cutlet is crisy and hot, but the meat inside isn't tough. The curry is not overly salty and has some potatos and carrots in it. There are also some picked radishes and thinly shredded lettuce, which I think are mostly for garnish. At $8.50 this is a good deal. \\n\\nI have also gotten the Udon set, which at $10 is also a good deal. You get udon noodle soup and a rice dish of your choice (curry katsu rice or one of their 'dons' like oyakodon, gyudon etc). I've also had their takoyaki, karage fried chicken, korroke fried potato, and onigiri rice balls. They are all decent and I'm happy with the quality of the food.  \\n\\nThis place is cheaper than Go-Go Curry (in H-mart Central Sq), but it's hard to say which place is better.

My disclaimer is that I don't speak much mandarin or cantonese and thus don't know the names of many dishes - but my taste buds don't know that.\\n\\nIn terms of size, the venue is small, no doubt. There are 2 or 3 large tables, and a slew of tables for 4. Smaller parties should be prepared to share tables with others, which is not unusual. The venue is quite clean and well-lit, though, so fear not in that respect.\\n\\nThe menu is quite twinkie and white-people friendly. I would like to add at this time that while I could be considered a twinkie, I think I am more of a deep fried one with some chocolate in the mix. Nevertheless, the menu completes the trifecta of English, Chinese and pictures. Therefore, as long as you have had dim sum before, you should be able to pick out exactly what you want. I suppose it can be implied that since there is a menu for the dim sum, there are no cart pushers.\\n\\nThe downside to the lack of cart pushes stems beyond less excitement and anticipation for what lies ahead. The menu system lends to one having to wait longer for food.\\n\\nMy dishes were my usual 5 for dim sum: shrimp in rice noodle, steamed shrimp dumplings, fried pork dumplings, chicken feet, steamed bean curd wraps. One can often estimate the taste of food by its appearance, and this was no different. The food looked like it was of good quality; ie: the fried pork dumplings looked crispy, and the chicken feet looked tender - and that turned out to be the case. However, the food also looked bland. Everything, from the bean curd wraps to the fried pork dumplings to even the tea, looked not only to be lacking in flavor, but also to be in a similar shade of dull brown. Taste was no different. Additionally, the sauces in which the dishes were prepared were of thin consistency, and tasted as watered down as they looked. \\n\\nMoving on to value. The portions were, even by the standards of dim sum, small. Not only was everything pediatric-portioned, but with the chicken feet dish specifically, the amount provided was less than standard. At $3.15 each dish, I expected more (then again, did I really?).\\n\\nWhen the bill came I got a double whammy. Not only was I charged for tea, albeit $0.50, but I was informed of a $20 minimum for credit cards. Unfortunately for them, I had but $5 in cash, so they had to take my Discover card with 5% cash back on restaurants.\\n\\n(^_^) Universally-friendly menu\\n(^_-) Options\\n(^_-) Presentation\\n(T_T) Taste\\n(-_-) Bang for buck\\n\\nDisappointed, but glad I came.

At about 8:30PM there was a 35 minute wait. No problem, I kind of expected a long wait. The took down our name and phone number and said they would call when our table was ready. I thought this was really nice, we didn't have to worry about them giving away our spot if we lost track of time. So, we headed over to Davis Street Tavern for some drinks while we waited. \\nWhen we got our call, we headed back over and were seated right away. Our waitress was super friendly, and seemed pretty knowledgeable about the dishes. Let me preface with the fact that we kind of went all out on ordering. Two of my friends were visiting from out of town so it was a special occasion. We ordered a bottle of sake (don't remember the name - little blue bottle) and the cocktail with calamansi lime juice in it (also don't remember the name). The cocktail was pretty sweet, but since we were sharing it, no biggie. Here is the (long) list of what we ordered:\\n\\n1.Pork collar - my favorite, perfectly juicy with a hint of \\"straight off the grill\\" flavor and an awesome dipping sauce.\\n2.Vietnamese style short ribs - also really good, taste like ones I have had in Filipino restaurants.\\n3. Plaa meuk ping (dried cuttlefish) - I didn't care too much for this one. Its like really dry, hard jerky. The flavor of the fish was good, but you only tasted it after about 2 minutes of chew-chew-chewing in your mouth, the sauce was just like the sweet chili sauce I have in my fridge.\\n4. Quail egg skewer - I thought these were really nice. Nothing to be scared of, small hard boiled style eggs, skewered and grilled. The sauce on them was really good too.\\n5. Pet pha lo - this is the duck leg soup. The broth was very aromatic and flavorful. Kind of salty in my opinion though. The meat was tender, fall off the bone. There isn't much of it to go around for 4 people, but would be good for 2 maybe.\\n6. Yam mama salad - it really is just cold, cooked, instant ramen noodles. Although I would have loved for the noddles to be of better quality the salad was cool and refreshing. Exactly what we needed to balance out all the heavy, meaty things we ordered. \\n7. Deep fried quail - This was just ok, and in my opinion the least \\"bang for our buck.\\"\\n8. Ju pa bao - the pork was very juicy and flavorful, and the bun was good too. Unfortunately there is a bone in the pork, and it wasn't really easy to eat as a sandwich. I ended up eating some pork, and then eating the bread separate.\\n\\n4 of the 8 dishes we ordered I would definitely order again (pork collar, short ribs, salad, quail egg), 3 of them were good but I would probably try something different next time (duck soup, deep friend quail, ju pa bao) and the dried cuttlefish just wasn't my cup of tea. * I should also note that by the time we were seated they were out of 5 menu items, we were kind of disappointed not to try the chicken butt! \\n\\nIt was kind of spendy, but we did order a lot of food and some drinks, and left feeling full and satisfied.

I've been here before, so I new I could expect a slightly high priced, but better than average product.  Normally I love to dig into their salads as a starter.  They have a great wedge salad and the hot house tomato salad is unique and tasty.  Trulucks is also great for wines by the glass, though I miss that they do not include Silver Oak on the by the glass menu anymore.  On this evening though, it was kinda late and I'd already had an appetizer with drinks, so I cut straight to the entrees.  I can't eat shellfish, so when I ordered the Jalapeno Salmon, I asked them to hold the crab.  Normally, they'll do that by placing the order as the grilled salmon and then bring me the jalapeno bernaise on the side and save me a few dollars off of the full entree price, which makes sense since I'm not getting the crab.  Not this time though.  Worse they brought it out with two big prawns resting on top of the bernaise sauce.  Ummmm... shrimp are shellfish, so not a good addition when someone tells you that they have shellfish allergy.  So back goes that plate.  There are people huddling, a manager comes over an apologizes and 20 minutes later (guess they had to catch another salmon) here comes the new plate, minus the shrimp.  The fish itself was deceiving because it had a near over-char on the outside, but was actually medium rare on the inside.  Except for Ahi, I wouldn't expect anything less than medium done for fish.  Fearing sending it back would have me waiting another 20 minutes, I pressed onward.  The sauce is unique and zesty.  The mashed potatoes are creamy and delicious.  Now for a couple of last beefs about the place...  the lighting is so low that you can barely see the food on your plate.  Seriously, if my mashed potatoes had been dyed orange, I would not have been able to tell.  Second beef... mistakes happen and while it took too long to bring out the second plate, it's not the first time I've told a restaurant no shellfish and had some brought out anyhow and it won't be the last, but you would think a comp glass of wine or cocktail or dessert would have been an appropriate amends, but alas, nothing was offered.  I'll probably give Trulucks another chance, because I think this was an off-night for them, but they need to fix the lighting and tell the kitchen to get it together."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Good service (not sure why so many reviewers felt the service was bad) and good dim sum.

I know, I know, it's a sports bar... but I'm slow, okay?! Leave me alone, I go here for the food, not the atmosphere.

Our server told us about some new appetizers and we decided to try the deep-fried triangle-shaped ones that were filled with pepperoni, cheese and sauce (the actual name escapes me right now... it was something about pizza...). They came out super hot with a side of warm marinara sauce. (Note: warm marinara sauce with hot appetizers is much better than cold marinara sauce with lukewarm appetizers.). I really liked the little pizza things, and, as the server pointed out, at $5.29 they're quite economical.\\n\\nThe Sam and I split 12 boneless wings - 6 with spicy garlic sauce and 6 with Parmesan garlic sauce. We've had these sauces before (spicy garlic is the hottest the Sam will go and we got the Parmesan one to have a nice mild balance), and they were good as usual (not great, or mind-blowing, but good). My cousin got a cheeseburger with onion rings that she said was good.

And The Ravenous Pig is a fine example of a successful endeavor for the Petrakis Family. To add to their repertoire, chef/owners James & Julie Petrakis (James Beard Award nominees) opened Cask & Larder fall of 2012, serving seasonal southern cuisine prepared with locally sourced ingredients and house brewed craft beers.\\n\\nSince it's opening I have visited the Cask & Larder for their fabulous Sunday brunch and dinner offerings. But today I am here to speak about their LUNCH. I had the pleasure of attending their exclusive media preview for lunch where Chef Rhys Gawlak, renowned for his artisanal butchery and charcuterie, oversees Cask & Larder's lunch and brunch services offering a vibrant daytime experience with fresh, homemade dishes. Lunch service will be open to the public on Thursday, July 11 and continue Wednesday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.\\n\\nIt was only noon, but you didn't have to twist my arm to order their hand crafted cocktails (yes, cocktails are taken seriously here too). We started our lunch with Back to Mezcali & Corpse Revivor, both of them were smooth, brimming with freshness.\\n\\nThe Basket caught our attention to nibble on something while enjoying our refreshing cocktails. Hush puppies, fried garlic-dill pickles, okra, savory cheese scone, hot sauce aioli, what's there not to love? Light & fluffy hush puppies, I could easily devour quite a few of these fried bites of corny heaven. Minimally dressed yet crunchy pickles made this 'basket' ideal for munching.\\n\\nWhere was I? Ah, the dishes we ordered....Nashville Hot Chicken, Brisket Melt, and Public House Bloody Mary. The Hot Chicken sandwich - finger licking and crunchy encased in a sea salt challah. Hmm, could I have another please? The Brisket Melt - bbq gastrique, pimento cheese, caramelized onions, and fried green tomatoes. Are you drooling yet? The Bloody Mary had the characteristics of a 'true' Mary and then some more. Spiked with fresh horse radish and pepper-infused deep eddy vodka,it screamed 'fresh' and flavorful. Perhaps my search for the perfect one has been accomplished!!\\n\\nBottom Line: Fresh, honest food, thoughtful touches - chef/owner Petrakises make a convincing argument that country cooking - be it fried chicken, meatloaf, or collard greens, is worthy of the respect typically accorded to haute cuisine.  And as important food is, the act of gathering friends and family around a well-worn table is welcomed if not encouraged wholeheartedly.\\n\\nIt's a restaurant with a point of view (and a great bar) in a sophisticated restaurant I can't wait to return to."},{"name":"Satu'li Canteen","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy, Ste E","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice ambiance and polite, helpful staff.

We'd been here a year or so ago, so this was our second visit.

Mr. Man ordered the Sesame Chicken.  We also got a spring roll and an egg roll, respectively.  Spring roll... great!  Actual veggies inside rather than a whole lot of blobby dough.  It was fried to perfection - not greasy at all.\\n\\nMr. Man's Sesame Chicken was mostly breading, lots of fat still left on the meat, and pretty greasy.  He said he's ordered the same dish here before and it was better.  \\n\\nThe Topon hot pot was sort of just... lackluster.  Good, but not great.  The seafood was well-cooked and fresh, however.  (I've pretty much sworn off ordering seafood in Columbus Chinese restaurants, but this was a positive experience!)  Q2 doesn't offer brown rice, which is a con for me.

First time my wife had and enjoyed the bahn mi, while I had three tacos. The tacos were good, but the toppings hid the meat some.

The slaw was fine -- I think I'd like more fennel in it, as the fennely bites were more interesting.\\n\\nNow, that brisket...! Having grown up in Kansas City, I suppose I'm a bit particular about brisket. Here, it is sliced thicker than in KC, as I believe is done in Texas establishments. My slices were from a thin piece of the brisket, which meant they were well smoked and redolent of oak. They were generously coated with the rub, which had turned into a wonderful, salty bark. Honestly, while I wrapped some pieces in the tortillas and lightly dipped them in the sauce, I ate most of it without sauce. It was just too good to cover up!\\n\\nThat said, the sauce also is excellent. I had the hot sauce, which has a nice spiciness and a good tang to it. It reminds me of the best of the sauces available in Kansas City.

When the door swung open for the back kitchen I also saw a big green egg inside, which I had never seen used in a restaurant. We made reservations for Saturday night, although on this particularly frigid evening we would have been fine without them. Before getting into the menu I'd like to mention that there was free self-parking in the attached parking deck as well as complimentary valet. Also, the bathrooms are single occupancy, so there can be a wait at times, but they were definitely well kept. \\n\\nBack to the food. Their menu is not the most vegetarian friendly, but for everyone else it is phenomenal. We started off with some Pinot noir and I ordered the four apples cocktail which was delicious. For appetizers we went with deviled eggs, mushroom toast, and the street corn. They were all scrumptious and we ended up getting a second order of the corn. My main dish was the shrimp risotto, while my dining companions got a short rib and the chicken+dumplings. Of the dishes ordered I would say that the ratio of price:portion was most appropriate for my meal. The other two entrees were on the smaller portion side and are not likely to fill someone up on their own. The service was on point the entire night and we were even thanked by other staff as we exited the restaurant. There was also outdoor seating facing Peachtree, which I'm sure is awesome in the summertime.

I was wildly disappointed.  \\n\\nWe really should have known better than to eat here - when we walked in on a thursday evening, we were hit with a wall of old fish smell.  It smelled like an outdoor fish market in a hot country at night, after all the fishmongers have gone and only the runoff liquids and scraps from cut fish that have been slowly pooling on the hot ground all day are left.  \\n\\nUndaunted, we sat down and ordered four apps (fried coconut shrimp, regular fried shrimp, fried calamari, and brazilian crab cake) and three main course dishes, including Feijoada Completa (Brazilian national dish) and two Moquecas.  \\n\\nThe fried apps were fried in old dirty oil. They came out blackened and dried, with a horrible old oil smell. You couldn't taste the first couple bites of seafood under the disgusting shell of burnt breading.  The seafood itself was rubbery.  We were the only people in the restaurant until about halfway through our meal, which leaves me stunned that the waitress or kitchen did not look at what they were serving us and take issue with it.  For the price we paid for the apps (approximately $9 each), we expected FAR better.  We could not taste or detect any coconut on the coconut shrimp - it tasted exactly the same as the regular shrimp.\\n\\nThe crab cake was surprisingly flavourless. The yucca flour was a nice touch, but the crabcake itself was so dry that the dusting of flour stuck to the roof of my mouth and coated the back of my throat like a cinnamon challenge gone wrong.\\n\\nAll of the appetizers were inadequately salted, which was disappointing, but better than them being over salted, I suppose.  We didn't bother finishing the appetizers (unusual for us because we generally are opposed to food waste), but were holding out hope for the main course.  \\n\\nEverything served in the main course was over salted (exact opposite of the apps - and we hadn't said anything to the waitress about salting).  The Feijoada Completa was so salty that I could not taste it after about five bites. The black bean stew was flavorless (besides the strong taste of salt) and had a really unpleasant texture. The top had dried as if it'd been sitting out for a while, leaving a weird pseudo-crust over the otherwise sloppy stew.  The dried meat was surprisingly gristly and the collard greens were greasy.  The fried plantains were the only passable thing on the plate, and even they had been fried in that gross old oil, which really took away from what is usually one of my favorite foods.\\n\\nThe moquecas were also incredibly salty and stunk of old fish.  This must have been partly where the smell of the restaurant came from.  The fish stench was so strong, that I felt uncomfortable eating it and worried that I would be sick later from food poisoning.  The old fish and salt flavours overpowered the rest of the stew, which otherwise would have been an interesting dish (the tomato was cool).  None of us finished any part of our meals and none of us wanted to take the leftovers home (again, extremely unusual).  Honestly, the meal was pretty nauseating.  Although none of us had eaten a real meal at Muqueca and were still hungry, our stomachs had turned so severely that none of us were able to eat again until the next day.\\n\\nOf the three waters that came with our meal, one came in a dirty glass. Two sets of silverware had to be sent back because they were dirty as well.  I don't understand how at a restaurant that has no other patrons besides our table of three, that they could serve us dirty tableware. It's not as if they were too busy with other patrons to notice.  Our waters were also not regularly filled - which is inexcusable when the restaurant is virtually empty and there are two waitresses on hand.  \\n\\nOverall, poor service and horrible food. It blew my mind that this horrible meal, where not a single dish had been edible, cost us over $100.  I've eaten far better food for three for $30.  I don't know where they get their pricing scheme, because none of the food was fresh.  I expect to pay $15-$30 per entree for FRESH seafood - not old seafood. If I wanted old seafood, I'd buy it at BJs for a couple dollars a piece and leave it out on my patio all day for it to stink up, then eat it.  I wouldn't go out to a two dollar sign ($$) restaurant for it.  I'm very confused as to where these positive reviews are coming from.  (I noticed another reviewer said this as well, perhaps the food is truly hit or miss.)  None of us will ever return.\\n\\nI really want to be able to say one nice thing about this restaurant.  The waitress was nice.  But she wasn't attentive.  We didn't finish a single item - our main courses had a few bites taken out of them. She never questioned this or asked how we enjoyed the food.

The space is understated, comfortable, clean, and modern. \\n\\nHaving scanned the menu, we were intrigued by the burger and decided it was time for our monthly burger quest experience.  We both had the Toast Burger.\\n\\nIt is served on what could best be described as upscale wonder bread (which isn't a bad thing, necessarily), which was lightly toasted, which served not only as a pun but also to give the bread enough tooth to hold up against the riotously juicy, medium-rare, loose-ground, beef patty.  So good. Flavorful without being decidedly peppery or anything like that, this meat showed up.  The burger was clearly crafted to feature this meast (meat-beast). The gruyere was nice and light, added some juiciness without being goopy.  Sauteed onions added a bit of texture, and an aioli of sorts on top and bottom was the last bastion against the meat juices sogging the bread. I always crave a tomato on my burger, but this was so juicy I didn't miss it a bit.  While the flavor was present and accounted for, I think some dill pickle would have put the taste profile up and over the top.\\n\\nBurger came with a few house made potato chips, which were about as exciting as you'd expect, but nothing to complain about.  The plates were pretty spartan, as those two items are it; no greens, no nothing.  We did take the hot sauce that was offered and it was a great California chile type of sauce, smoky with just a hint of heat. I put that shiz on everything.\\n\\nWe did order a tasty little salad($6) to split and that helped with being sated, but overall, we didn't feel like we got quite enough food to justify the price. $11 for a plate that probably should have been more around 8 or 9, so no huge deal, just a little off from our perspective.

In college I worked at a gourmet restaurant and if someone complained that the food wasn't hot we went to great lengths to ensure that it got back to the diner within a reasonable time frame and piping hot. \\n\\nSo, again, my wife pointed out to the waitress (very politely, mind you) that the food was still cold. The waitress said \\"Sorry,\\" shrugged and walked away. We decided then that it was time to leave. The waitress brought us a piece of cake to take with us \\"for our trouble.\\" My wife was in tears when we left, our food was mostly untouched. \\n\\nWhen we got back to the hotel and sampled our free cake we had to spit it out. It had soured! We had to laugh over that. The sour cake (and chocolate cake isn't supposed to be sour) was, no pun intended, the icing on the cake. We like to dine out, but you can rest assured we'll never go to Saltyard again. It wasn't just the cold food but the waitress' attitude of \\"Oh well, sucks for you.\\" that got to me. I'll take my money elsewhere."},{"name":"Crisp Salads","address":"3901 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I took an Uber to Crisp on a Saturday dinner time break from a weekend long conference at Moda Center.

Had some Brazilian cheese puffs (not sure what to call them) which are gluten free also and gave a feeling of having bread with my salad without the carbs and wheat.

It's right above the Elephant Room on Congress, and it's what Austinites might remember as the Kyoto sushi restaurant. One might describe the restaurant environs as steam punk (think: Jules Verne, 2,000 leagues under the sea) meets lounge. It's very hip and fun and lively and really transports you. I felt as if I were somewhere in NYC. The tables are small and close together and I think the intimate restaurant is perfect for a romantic meal followed by a visit to a jazz show downstairs.\\n\\nOur party of 6 fit into the large booth in the corner and we had the spiced beer nuts, french fries, and blistered shishitos with Garrotxa cheese. The person with the spiciest shishito pepper won a shot of something something (shot of whiskey in pickle juice?). I think it was an opening night thing, so don't expect that, but do expect every sauce--including mayo, ketchup, squid ink, wing sauce, etc.-- be handmade, original and delicious. \\n\\nFor the second course, we had the pork belly foie gras bahn mini mihs, which are a great combination. The foie gras melts in your mouth, along with the crispy bread, cilantro, pork belly, and jalepenos. Everyone loved the caesar salad. Note that the fish is served with its head on, eyeballs and everything! Zut alors! Again, very exciting, and one the most popular dishes of the evening, along with the scallops that are served on  a cucumber sorbet with a spicy sauce on the side. We also tried the venison kebab, which is served with a purple squid ink sauce. The duck wings had a great tangy-sweet dipping sauce. The braised oxtail and blue cheese flatbread was really tender and yummy. My favorite thing of all had to be the squid fries. \\n\\nFor dessert, we became gluttonous little fatties, as if we weren't already, and tried the Popcorn and a Movie, which was a salty sweet crowd pleaser. The Lemon Panna Cotta was excellent, and was a contender for my favorite panna cotta in town, which used to be located at Vespaio Enoteca. And then came the craziest thing of all: the Peanut Butter and Jelly dessert. There were cute little waffle things, fresh fruit jam, and the amazing foie gras \\"peanut butter.\\" I will upload a picture of this sweet treat that I can't stop talking about, as well as some other fun pics. \\n\\nAll in all, it was an exciting night for the foodies. The service merited five stars, just like everything else. Mostly, I was happy to finally see something more culinarily adventurous come to town. I remember when, in 2001, Wink first opened and how revolutionary it seemed at the time: wine pairing, food that was fresh from the garden, menus that changed daily. I felt that same excitement when I went to Swift's Attic.

Im not really big on whiskey so usually go to the cocktail section without the whiskey. I like the Hurricane. Ive had the chicken and waffles which doesn't taste as basic as it sounds--- packed with flavor and they serve it with a pepper maple syrup and honey pepper sauce- spicy food is my weakness. It's not to my level of spiciness (which isn't the norm lol) but it has a nice flavorful subtle kick to each bite.

First time at this restaurant.  We arrived about 6:30 pm.  No wait.  Apparently Monday evening is a good choice of time if you don't want to wait.  It's a very small restaurant.  Our waiter was an older man with a none too pleasant personality.  He was very hurried with us and not very engaging at all.  He was curt with us if we asked questions about the menu.  The menu says No Splitting on the bottom and prices were in the $20 - $30+ range for entrees.  2 of us ordered the Rino Special (chicken, veal, shrimp in a bourbon cream sauce.  It was $32 + $7 if you wanted homemade pasta with it.  Our servings were huge!  Too big.  The bourbon sauce was meh.  Very boring. There were only 2 shrimp in each dish. I was not impressed with the homemade fettucine.  I've made great pasta.  Rino's was too thick and floury in flavor.  Maybe I've made upscale pasta.  My husband had a dish called Ribeye Pizzoli or something like that.  This was also $30+ and had the biggest, thickest slab of Ribeye this side of Oklahoma.  Came on a bed of curly pasta with some type of red sauce.  I thought the Ribeye (ordered MR) was tough.  Pasta (imo) once again blah. Husband liked his dish.  Another friend ordered Seafood Cannoli.  We tasted his dish and we all liked it.  Beat mine.  My daughter ordered the Lobster Ravioli. They were huge raviolis.  My only complaint with this dish was the red sauce was bland but I would order this dish with possibly a different sauce in the future.  Crown jewel of the evening might have been the Eggplant Parmesan ordered by my niece.  That was very good!  Other good things were the salads.  Fresh and delicious with the Italian dressing.  I would go again and try different dishes.  Next time I'll eat here at the beginning of my vacation so I can take my left-overs with me.  Home-made means made at home, it doesn't equate with great.

If it weren't for Yelp, I wouldn't have given MuQueCa a second glance. A few of us tried to  eat here after the Fluff festival but the wait was pretty long. Then when I was looking for good restaurants to donate to the date auction, Tom E.  suggested this place. It wasn't until last night that I got to eat here.\\n\\nSo Barbara Ann (and her lovely children), Paul, Jessika, Roni and I had a delicious dinner here for Ms. Roni's b-day. The place was small, but they were able to accommodate our group of 8. While we were waiting for our food I ordered a strawberry pina colada (virgin, no additives) and it was delicious. That was gone before I even realized it. Barbara Ann let us sample some of the yucca and beef patties that she ordered for her kids. Yum and Yum. As a main dish, I got the Seafood Casserole as per Jessika's suggestion. MMMMM.. goooddd. The seafood was plentiful and I got a shrimp or mussel in pretty much every bite. I loved that it was still bubbling in it's little clay pot when the waitress served it to me. I also picked at Roni's collard greens. Hmm.. not my cup of tea, but Jessika liked it. \\n\\nOne of Barbara Ann's children had gone up to the waitress to tell her it was Roni's birthday, so at the end of the meal they brought out a delicious slice of cake with a candle! It seemed chocolate mousse-ish with chocolate shavings? I don't really know, but it was heavenly.\\n\\nThey were very kid friendly it seemed. Like I've read in other reviews, the service is okay. The waitresses were quite friendly, but our water glasses never got refilled and Roni had to remind them about her collard greens (she had subbed them for the rice). All in all I'd say 4.5 stars... 5 stars for their generous donation to the date auction!\\n\\nNOTE: Seafood Casserole is still quite delicious cold at 2AM without refrigeration (unless you count the cold car) the night of purchase. \\n\\nPS - Some weird woman was videotaping us while we were there.

But before I get started let me just say that there is a slight difference Cajun & Creole cooking. A vastly simplified way to describe the two cuisines is to deem Creole cuisine as \\"city food\\" while Cajun cuisine is often referred to as \\"country food. Basically what we ordered was gumbo as an appetizer and red beans and rice as an appetizer along with 2 glasses of sangria. When we went to order our main course we found that there was a special. It was 1 pound of king crab legs, 1 pound of snow crab legs, one pound of shrimp peel and eat, two sides and two drinks, $68.95 for two, which at Bob Chinn's in Chicago, would have been about $150. Since we had already ordered the two sides and the two drinks the waiter (Sean) allowed us to combine it into the special dinner offer. Both the red beans and rice and the gumbo were absolutely incredible. Only thing I had against the Gumbo compared to my local Bob Chinn's in Chicago, is the fact that Bob Chinn's version had a lot more seafood in it and was more expensive, though flavor and taste were identical and awesome. The red beans and rice had an incredible Savory Spice to it that was not hot, but very flavorful, and it was not dry like most red bean and rice dishes, this was more like a soup with chunks of andouille  sausage in it, and it was fabulous. The shrimp was peel and eat with the head on, and I was told that that allows more flavor out of the shrimp, and I must admit it was more flavorful than most peel and eat shrimp. King crab legs and the snow crab legs also cooked marvelous and had exceptional taste to it. The only thing I should have done is ordered a bit more garlic butter. I have to conclude by saying that the owner of the restaurant, Kim, lived in New Orleans for 25 years and has picked up some of the exceptional flavors from that area and brought them to Florida in the most wonderful way. When Kim had time, and was not overseeing everything, she stopped at every table to talk with the customers and find out how they were enjoying their dining experience.

We arrived at about 9:45 a.m and there were a few tables available. By 10:30 all the tables and most of the bar seats were full. There's a reason for that...this is a good place. The lesson  is this; no matter what day of the week, go early or expect to wait. \\n\\nWith 250 plus reviews already posted, what might we offer that isn't simply \\"us too\\" for enjoying the experience here? \\n\\nMaybe this... \\n...we disliked the seating less than we expected to, \\n...we enjoyed the food every bit as much as we anticipated we would with thanks to Yelp friends and other Yeeps for pointing us in one direction or another. \\n...service really was \\"all that\\" for efficiency, and \\n...although the Yelp page says wheelchair accessible - yes\\" that is not via the front door. Diners in wheelchairs and those who dine with them may find it helpful to know the alternate entry in advance. \\n\\nSEATING: We dislike communal tables. We expected the seating here, that we'd heard described as \\"community\\",  would be something we'd dislike. But in fact, although the seating is lined up cheek to cheek, that is both north and south cheeks, at the wall, there is lots of space behind tables for servers and others to come and go. We found this less objectionable than the \\"sardine can\\" seating in some other restaurants. \\n\\nWith only about 8\\" of space from side table edge to table edge, there is no expectation of privacy for conversation. Still it is amazing how many folks think that might be so, as in the duo at the table along side of us. We stuck to 144 character type discourse, mainly about the food, and felt pretty comfortable. \\n\\nSERVICE: We like shared plate formats that is the theme here and the servers were top notch for making recommendations when asked and for getting the food out of the kitchen and to the table at the right temperature and in perfect pace. Brava! (All women servers that morning so the accolade fits. ;-) ) \\n\\nFOOD: \\n\\nAs small plates... \\n\\n...thanks to Yelp friends Dan H, Danni D and Jens J who all recommended the chocolate potato donut with creme anglaise. Thanks  to Jens who warned against the temptation to order more than one. Delicious and not too sweet but one was plenty for ttwo of us to split. \\n\\n...the almond stuffed, bacon wrapped, maple syrup covered griddled dates were very good, But at $2 each these are things we wouldn't order again. Lots of places in Portland do great dates and we make good ones at home. We recommend saving the calories and the $4 spent on two dates and invest both in the vanilla panna cotta. \\n\\n...Yams with cumin and maple syrup were out of this world. Just the right touch of salt mixed with the cumin on the yams and roasted perfectly with skin both glazed with and nestled on maple syrup. These would be something we'd have again. And again. \\n\\nThe large plate... \\n\\n...we shared soft polenta with sausage ragu, mozzarella and a fried egg on top, although we asked for our egg to be cooked \\"broken yolk hard\\" instead of the softer yolk version of the menu. The wonderfully flavored dish arrived in a small cast iron skillet, piping hot and with the egg perfectly cooked. \\n\\nAlthough we weren't in need of dessert... \\n\\n... when the server presented the dessert menu we couldn't resist the vanilla panna cotta topped with apple caramel and toasted walnuts. The texture of the panna cotta was perfect, it was just sweet enough,the chilled temperature was just right  and the toppings were wonderful with it. We think this ought to go on the small plates menu too so folks don't miss out on ordering it...after all the chocolate donut appears both in small plates and dessert!! \\n\\nOur beverage choice... \\n\\n...was coffee, although worth noting they offer full bar service at brunch at at 10:00 on a Monday morning there were several diners enjoying the same. For our two bits, coffee was the weak link in the meal, just not a blend that we thought was great. Different strokes etc.  But it was served in a mug that helped keep it warm and the servers made sure the mug stayed full until we said \\"no thanks\\". \\n\\nACCESSIBILITY: \\n\\nSince we noted the \\"wheelchair access: yes\\" on the Yelp page, we were surprised to find five or six stairs to climb to get into the restaurant from the front door. We asked the server about it and she said wheelchair access was via a ramp at the center of the building complex and then entry through the restaurant's back door.. So we exited that way to check it out...manual wheelchair users may find it helpful to know in advance that it is a steep ramp, way more than 1:12 we think, so assistance may be necessary to get up it. \\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: \\n\\nNot a linger over  intimate meal kind of place, but we're tempted to go back for the great food during \\"off peak time\\",  in spite of the cheek to cheek seating."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere!

The design of the lunchmeat was very nicely displayed. The roasted veggies lacked a little oomph in flavor(although the mix of variety was pleasantly different), but you were able to taste each vegetable by itself. The cannoli cream had a slight anise taste, but was also fresh tasting, so it wasn't a problem. The chicken parm and porchetta were outstanding. The chicken and broccoli macaroni had a flat white sauce (not cream-based), but again, the freshness and general quality of food made it a non issue.

I figured if they opened at 9 and we were there by 9:30, the wait wouldn't be too bad at all. Boy was I wrong. 30 minutes after opening, the wait for 3 people was an hour... Crazy! We decided to tough it out and wait. The problem with a small place like this being so popular is there's no lobby. There are two chairs near the coffee area which leaves everyone else standing on the stairs for prolonged periods of time, not the best layout! When we were finally seated and got the chance to order, the waitress mentioned that the restaurant was family style. Many of the modern restaurants I've eaten at recently have adapted this style and I have a love-hate relationship with it. While you do get to try more of the menu items, you don't really get enough of each to fill you up. This was definitely the case at Tasty n Sons! I left feeling hungry but I LOVED every single thing I ate. The chocolate potato doughnuts were good but not worth $2 each. They had a great chocolate flavor but still tasted like a generic doughnut. I would skip these. Erin's biscuits were amazing, light and fluffy with fresh whipped cream. My favorite part was the blackberry/huckleberry sauce, perfect balance of sweet and sour. The pear and apple butter on Aunt Paula's french toast was absolutely delicious and the toast itself was soft and fluffy. My brother said it was the best french toast he's ever had! The fried chicken on the sandwich was nice and crispy but it was dark meat. Not my favorite but many people think it's more flavorful!

I have NEVER written a review for anything before and I am only compelled to write this one hoping the owners will consider making some small changes so that I will feel comfortable coming back.  \\n\\nMy family and I, including 2 young kids, had lunch here during the lunch hour.  Our greeter and server was super friendly.  The dining area easily accommodated our group and big stroller.  A high chair was provided.  Upon arrival it seemed perfect!\\n\\nHowever, his is NOT a kid friendly place to eat unless you are grabbing take out.  Maybe that is intentional but in my opinion any place that supplies a high chair should also supply something that a child of high chair age might eat... I admit I should have taken a closer look at the menu before we were seated.   My first clue should have been the fact that both my 2 year old AND 1 year old were served water in delicate-looking glass glasses.  I had to ask for plastic then only got one and without a lid.  \\n\\nThe best bet for them seemed like the grilled cheese hold the onions and grilled watermelon.  No go.  They wouldn't have anything to do with the grilled cheese.  When the server asked I was honest and told him neither of them would eat it.  He didn't offer another suggestion ... crackers,  a slice of UNgrilled watermelon, bread.  \\n\\nMy salad, the mixed greens with berries was super good but I had to give all the berries to my kids because they were starving and then had to scarf it down because they were getting unruly by this point with nothing but berries to eat.  \\n\\nMaybe I am being unreasonable but the name Picnic House gives a family friendly feeling.  I think kids, kites, fresh watermelon, corn on the cob, simple sandwiches, cheese and crackers, fresh fruit, yogurt.  But this is really more of a romantic picnic for 2 kind of a place.  \\n\\nAnother thing, totally gross (I am embarrassed to admit this) but I had to change the 1 year olds diaper on the floor in the bathroom because there wasn't a changing table provided in either of their 2 otherwise very nice and clean bathrooms.  Thank goodness it was clean!  \\n\\nMaybe this is my fault for staying but in my experience a high chair available = at the very least a kid friendly beverage and container, a kid friendly menu item and a safe place for diaper changing.  We have been to plenty of places that don't offer high chairs and that is totally their right but it alerts us to the fact that it is not a good place for us and we go somewhere else.  \\n\\nMy hope is that this review will prompt the owners to consider making some additions and not the opposite by encouraging them to get rid of the high chairs."},{"name":"Kings Dining & Entertainment","address":"50 Dalton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We usually go for trivia, which makes for a fun Monday night.

She proceeds to offer me a red stripe or some watermelon drink in a can. No thanks, I'll just take a rum punch. Literally, 45 minutes went by...by now the band is on stage.....still no drink. She comes and takes the food order....I ask about my drink.....food comes about another 30 minutes or so later. We could only order wings at this point. I ask a second time about my drink. Mind you, my order of wings never came out. They sent out garlic something or other, and I ordered lemon pepper. So a friend of mine decided to just eat mine because she arrived after we placed the order and it was taking too long or them to come back. By this time, I'm hungry and thirsty...drink finally comes. Another person asked for a sprite three times and when she finally asked the waitress if she should go to the bar and get it, she got an attitude. The hostess comes out (not the waitress) and asks if we need anything else, so I asked for a water. She asked everyone else if they wanted water. Some time later ( I stopped counting at this point because it was only making me mad) she comes out and gives everyone else water BUT me. REALLY!?? Wasn't I the one who asked for it in the first place? I seriously thought I was on that show \\"Punked\\" at this point. This was unreal. It just got worse and worse. We finally got our bill and left. I have NEVER left early when GJB was performing, but I couldn't take it anymore. I'm wondering if the same employees were kept when they bought the place because Kouture had the same awful service. It's unfortunate because you really want to support minority businesses. The 20% gratuity that was automatically included was NOT deserved at all. It's usually those restaurants that include it automatically, that have the worst service. If I wasn't ready to leave, I would've asked for it to be removed.  My main concern is, how are you going to promote an even that you aren't able to properly accommodate for? Not sure if they are used to this number of people attending, but the band has a large following--Definitely needed more staff if they do this again. As a certified wedding and event planner, I'm always looking for places to refer clients.  I hope this was an isolated incident, but unfortunately I won't be returning to find out."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Like I would give the Son of Toro Bravo anything less than five stars.

If I had to describe it simply I'd say it is southern food for the person that has never eaten in the south. The mixed drink offerings are exciting but I will say that it might be best to stay away from their Carolina Bloody as it tastes a lot like you are drinking a sweet marinara sauce. The staff is polite and attentive and the manager can be seen strolling the dining room assuring quality. All in all the pricing for dishes is unreasonable. I am certain the ingredients are quality and fresh, however, they come together to create a series of dishes that miss the target entirely.

Located a bit farther out at 38th/Gladstone in SE, this is a totally unassuming little place to find such amazing pizza.  \\n\\nGladstone has two businesses almost right next to each other, the pub on the corner, and then the coffee/pizza house two stores down.  Walking by, the pub looked like an old house that was converted to the neighborhood watering hole.  This would be a great chill way to spend an afternoon enjoying the sun and some beers with a group of friends.  They also have the bean bag throwing game, which is always a good time!\\n\\nIt was so refreshing to walk into somewhere, starving, and NOT wait an hour for a table!  We were warmly greeted upon walking in, and at 6pm the place was wide open for seating.  They have picnic tables in the front, and a cute terrace-style area in the back.  The inside has a vintage diner vibe, with old wooden furniture and knick-knacks.  They also feature local artist projects, and some canvas paintings of the Portland city scape were impressive.  The weather was off and on rain all day, so we chose a window table inside the caf√©.  The music was great - oldies were on the whole time.  \\n\\nGladstone has a \\"build your own\\" pizza menu.  You start with either a traditional cheese (tomato sauce, mozzarella and pecorino cheese) or pesto (pesto sauce, and pecorino cheese) pie, and add any toppings you want (great selection of veggies and meats).  We chose the large traditional cheese pie (they were out of the small pies, though we were hungry enough for the large anyway), and added Italian sausage, sun-dried tomatoes and roasted garlic.  The pizza came out piping hot, and had perfectly fresh ingredients.  The Italian sausage was in small pieces (not like a full sausage just cut up) and the garlic was in baby cloves.  The crust was made of a simple white flour dough, but was thin and chewy, with just the right amount of burnt edges.\\n\\nThey have a nice little draft beer selection (includes light and heavy options), however the organic Red I wanted was out, and Armando got the last IPA, which was a bummer.  \\n\\nFYI, they serve Stumptown coffee and assorted pastries.  We tried the oatmeal/chocolate chip cookie and it was ridiculously huge and delicious...like your mom would make.\\n\\nPricing is right on par with Apizza Scholls (pizzas start at $17, then add toppings), and quality is matched in both taste and quality.  Apizza gets 5 stars, however, when you take into consideration their superior location and extensive draft offerings.  Gladstone gets a solid 4, and we loved every bite."},{"name":"Orange Corner Cafe","address":"374 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"It takes chutzpah to open a coffeehouse a few blocks from DD, and the local places (e.g. Pavement - formerly Espresso Royale), but the Orange Corner Cafe found the perfect location across from the Orange Line T station on Mass Av.

Not to mention the beer selection.  It gets quite loud inside, but it's appropriate with the ambiance.  Outdoor seating is great, though always crowded.  And if you go on a night when they have live music, you wont be disappointed - the bands are always good and loud!  Being by a canal gives it another advantage to being unique and fun.

The dining area is pretty loud and country music is played through the speakers throughout, but we could still hear ourselves and enjoy each others company.  The tables were good in that the two of us got a four seat table with enough room to spread out and have a conversation.  Nothing worse than going to some fru fru place where you are so close to your neighboring diners that you feel the urge to pick at their plate when their done.  Anyway, nice tables, though the place is loud.\\n\\nThe drinks were really good.  We tried the sangria and margaritas. The opinion was that the sangria was yummy and the margaritas got the job done.\\n\\nThe food we had was ok.  They start you off with a basket of chips and salsa, pretty standard for a tex-mex joint.  The cajun popcorn shrimp appetizer was really tasty when dipped into the sauce provided.  Well worth it.  I had the cajun burger for my entree.  I figured it would have a little kick from the cajun seasoning, but really it just seemed like a normal burger you could pick up anywhere.  Heather O's quesidilla was not very good and was only slightly picked at throughout the meal. She mentioned that she should have got the salad. \\n\\nThis place is a casual sit down restaraunt good for families (we saw many kids of all ages) to share a reasonably priced meal (fifty bucks for the 2 of us).

I thought of hanging out, getting beers and dinner with the girls, stocking up the jukebox with our favorite spazzy hits.\\n\\nWhat I got was a crowd of sorority girls,  wealthy yuppies, a 45 minutes wait to be seated, bad service, and sub-par food at New York prices ( but not New York quality).\\n\\nI really hate writing negative reviews on Yelp, which is why I hope to visit Highland Kitchen again to see if I can be proven wrong.\\n\\nTo address my grievances:\\nIt felt weird to walk into a local establishment that  has been, I guess due to considerable media hype, overrun with the \\"Daily Candy\\" and \\"Stuff @Night\\" crowd. As my dear friend Alyssa crowed as we walked in \\"Toto, I don't think we're in Somerville anymore!\\" My other friends were similarly weirded out by the crowd, flashing their Louis Vuitton purses and Anthropologie duds. \\"Who are these people?\\" my boyfriend whispered. Maybe this is my own personal bias, so feel free to ignore it and add another star to my review, but I just didn't like the vibe of snobbery I got from the place.\\n\\nWe waited 45 minutes to be seated at 6:30pm on a Saturday night. For so early on in the evening, I thought this a tad ridiculous. We probably would have left if we weren't expecting some really awesome food. \\n\\nThe attitude of the servers and hostesses ranging from mild disdain to totally ignoring us. When our name was next on the waiting list, the hostess called another party several names down who had the exact same number of people as us. I called her on her mistake and reminded her we we next on the list.  Whether this was deliberate or not, it was a bummer to wait around even longer until it could be rectified. I don't remember the server checking back on our table to see how we were doing ( until it was time for desert) as well.\\n\\nThe Food: I had the baked chicken breast. I didn't realize that this would have skin on it, akin to fried chicken ( I don't believe that was noted in the menu) but that was a disappointment, as I had to peel it all off. Don't get me wrong; the chicken itself and accompanying veggies were very good, plated without much creativity, but good. However , I'd wager it wasn't worth the $15 I paid for it. I've had chicken such as this made by friends and family  with equal aplomb, so this seemed like nothing too revelatory, daring, or unique. My friends were equally disappointed with their salads, which they felt were rather bland and too expensive.\\n\\nThe jukebox is, as previously stated, amazing. Perhaps of the same caliber as Charlie's Kitchen, but superior because you can hear it better in HK.\\n\\nI really want to revisit Highland Kitchen, maybe on a weekday evening,(maybe this would solves some of my issues with it?) and get something a little simpler and less expensive, perhaps a cubano, before I write it off.

I'm speaking mostly of the bar-staff.  Some might say that their attitudes are part of the charm but those people are suckers.  Most of the people that work here are cool, even half the people that work at the bar are cool but a anus of an bartender goes a loooong way towards making a place suck.  And such is the case here.

Well there are plenty of jobs in dark dingy filing cabinet-lined offices out there that need miserable jerks like you to join their ranks.  \\n\\nOkay so... If you're going out to eat this place isn't bad.  Some of their food is awesome but some of it is only okay.  In general, it's overpriced and you're paying for the \\"vibe\\" as much as you are the french fries.  The bacon grits thing is really good, as are a few of the brunch items.  This place tends to get crowded and when it is crowded, its definitely NOT worth the wait.  Hostesses and waitresses all seem to be pretty friendly.  There is live bluegrass music on sundays, which is awesome.  Sometimes they have music at night too.  Try and catch the Coachmen if you can.  \\n\\nFinal thoughts: I'm a little pissed right now and it's clouding my judgement.

The menu is quite extensive with traditional fare and live seafood. The dishes are beautifully prepared and very tasty.

But those who know me, well, it was pretty much business as usual, no surprises here. My dining companions feared that I hated the burger before I even tried it, but just to prove them wrong, I loved it. Let's be clear, I loved the burger, but nothing else on that plate was enjoyable. Highland Kitchen, slightly out my comfort zone in Somerville, has a very similar vibe to Trina's Starlite Lounge, another Somerville establishment. Both are eerily identical in terms of style, substance, and ambiance, attracting local hipsters and bitter chefs from Watertown. I was turned off by poor customer service over the phone, (no reservations for parties less than six?) a twenty-minute wait on a Thursday night, and a menu that just couldn't seem to make up it's mind. (are you Southern or not? I don't get it) Honestly, I couldn't wait to dislike the food, because it would have been oh-so-fun to review, but that burger was just too damn good.When I say the burger is simple I mean exactly that, lettuce and tomato don't even make the sandwich, you get a bun, cheese, meat, and that's it. Caramelized red onions, pickles and fries come on the side, but the real star is that burger, and for $9.95 you get 8oz of pure Angus pleasure. This place really could have gone either way; ranging from a nice neighborhood joint with simple honest food, or an over-hyped, snobby, locals-only place where the food looks good on paper but never delivers. Fortunately it's the former, as they focus on local, homemade products and you can sense the passion and the dedication all over the place. Our server was engaging, despite being less than attentive, never refilling my water glass during the meal, but you could tell he loved working at Highland Kitchen, and believed in the product.\\n\\nThe burger is no frills, no sauce or insane toppings, to cover anything up. They say 8oz, but that's got to be pre-cooking weight, because it felt more like 6oz, tops. But no matter, the bun, which I couldn't quite figure out, was an absolute pleasure, buttered, toasted just right and had the perfect mix of softness and crunch that it needed, despite being a touch soggy from the moisture. It's a tricky thing that juice, too much bread and it's absorbed, too little bread and it drips right through, but this was as close to a perfect bun as I've had. The burger is seasoned just right, the salty, crunchy exterior shining through and really adding a layer of flavor throughout. The burger has a grilled cheese, patty-melt kind of feel, most of which comes from the aforementioned buttered bun, it was cooked a spot-on medium rare, although it could have been a touch more juicy. Overall, it was intensely satisfying and as simple and straightforward as you can get, but that's what I loved about it. I just wish the rest of the ingredients held their own, the caramelized red onions on the side were watery and bitter (they never caramelize well) and the house-made pickles were a bit too sweet and not enough sour for this burger lover. The fries were a miss, fried only once, they were mushy and under-seasoned. Overall, a top-notch burger gives Highland Kitchen high marks, but to win elite status, you really need the entire package, and for all those who think fries are irrelevant, think again. I want the package deal, the perfect burger, fries, atmosphere, and service. The value, vibe and burger is all here, and that's ultimately what I'll remember the most."},{"name":"Big Town Hero","address":"7000 NE Airport Way","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"I was hungry.

BF had a steak (I can't remember what kind - I believe the cuts change nightly?) and it was so good. Lots of great flavor, really tender. Excellent.\\n\\nThen came the bleu cheese.

The guy at the register was nice enough to inform us of the 2 tacos and a side special. He didn't have to. We also got maduros and Mexican street corn. Everything was amazing.

Some people like things that are different just for being different. But different doesn't mean good. I thought this place is just pretentious.\\n\\nFirst, after we ordered our meal the waitress informed us that they serve \\"family style\\" meaning that our orders will just come out when the cooks put it up there and not all together. OK - that's not what \\"family dining\\" means, that's just a way explaining that your kitchen is lazy and doesn't time their tickets. \\"Family dining\\" means that you order large dishes that you serve from and share around a table. Which brings me to the size of the orders. The menu is dived into small dishes and large dishes. we ordered large dishes, and they were small. especially for the price. Sharing a dish like this would mean only a dfew bites, which means you don;t even really experience it.\\n\\nNow i'll address the food. It is very unique, and from my opinion, misdirected. For instance, I ordered the Boudin Blanc omelette. I was hesitant at first because it had celery root in it, which I didn't see working, but the celery root was actually good. What was off was the presence of dijon. Dijon does not belong in an omelette as it overpowers the subtle, rich flavor of eggs. The white sausage was tasty, however was only sliced in half lengthwise. the casing was difficult to cut through and runied the integrity of the omelette. i will say this, the egg was white all over and fluffy- the two signs of a well cooked omelette. \\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the moroccan chicken hash. OK - so green beans and brussel sprouts for breakfast aren't the best choice. The only thing about the hash that was moroccan was the harissa cream, which was barely present 9and harissa cream is Tunisian and used all over north africa, so....).\\n\\nbasically, i think there's a reason why traditional breakfast foods are served at breakfast. trying to be different from varying from that is risky. I think maybe i'd like tasty n Sons more if I came in for lunch. if you want delicious and different breakfast food - go to the tin Shed."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is a great place to bring out-of-town guests!

For entrees, I had the pesto gnocchi and my date got the tortellini quattro formaggi with chicken added. His came in a very light garlic wine sauce but was still good. Mine was almost inedible with the amount of basil in the pesto. While I appreciate a homemade sauce of any kind, the balance here was way off and it was just not enjoyable. \\n\\nI can never dump on an Italian meal TOO much, but this was probably close to the bottom of the list: prepackaged bread, awful pesto, drafty seats, so-so service...

The staff should consider throwing those types out."},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"Border caf√© was fabulous! the drinks were perfect and our waitress was accomidating and made sure my cousin and myself were taken care of!

(Also a plus, their bathrooms are always clean, this is important to me if I'm gonna sit at a restaurant for 1+ hour.)\\n\\nAs other reviewers mentioned, they serve lychee flavoured tea here and it's the BEST. I haven't yet had this tea anywhere else, so I drink this tea a lot when I eat here (hence the bathroom cleanliness is extra important!!).  When we're here, we often order the sui-kau dumpling in soup, the seafood (usually crab or lobster, whatever is on special), stir fried clams in black bean sauce, pea shoots, baked pork jowl, the side dish platter (jelly fish, beef shank, fried shrimp and honey garlic ribs mmmhm), and plain congee. It's always a combination of any of those dishes, and they have never failed to deliver.\\n\\nBecause this place is not a fancy seafood restaurant, the prices reflect this ambiance (or lack thereof).  You get really good value when you come here, but it's really for the food, and not the experience.  I see other reviewers are not impressed with the service, but honestly, I don't really expect good service at most Chinese restaurants.  Heck, I've had worse service at Sea Harbour Restaurant (the Chinese restaurant at River Rock Casino, and the prices there are $$$, we paid $80 for watercress soup, but that's another story...), and they're supposed to be \\"fancy\\".\\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this place and I come here pretty regularly.  It's also the sort of place that's disappearing in Vancouver to give way to more trendy food joints. There aren't that many congee noodle house type restaurants around any more and that's ok.  This one I hope stays."},{"name":"Q2 China Bistro","address":"472 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"I like it. It doesn't taste like traditional asian fare - they have my least favorite general tso's chicken - but their honey mustard pot is absolutely delicious, and I find myself craving it on occasion.\\n\\nActually - screw everything else. Just get the pot. They're a good lunch, not too expensive, and have a spring roll.\\n\\nI haven't been here for a HH - because it's never come up, and I've never thought of coming here for a HH, so maybe this needs to me remedied soon."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place was the nicest restaurant my group went to while in Austin and it did not disappoint. We ordered the edamame for the table and their spin was so fun. It's a little spicy and there are pop rock candy for a little pop and fun in your mouth. I ordered the pork cheeks for my entree and let me tell you that was the most tender piece of meat I've ever had. It basically fell of in pieces because it was so tender. Our server was very nice, attentive and answered all our questions.

Well, the beans were so watery they leaked out of the foil and caused the paper bag to burst. A mess in the car. I cleaned it up and opened up a taco. Liquified beans dropped out making more mess. So, I returned the tacos to the drive-thru window. I spoke with a very courteous manager, Gabriella. She exchanged my tacos for something more solid. Potatoes. What a mess though. But on a good note, the manager was able to help me quickly and professionally."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ok. The food is good which is why I gave this place any stars and our waitress was really nice. But, this is a place that is trying soooooo hard. When we arrived the hostess gave the impression. That unless you made a reservation it's a long wait and impossible to get a seat...mind you, there were a ton of empty table that could easily accommodate my party of 3. It was annoying, but so laughable it didn't bother me. We were told it was going to be a wait. Maybe 30 minutes. So, I went onto the website and made a reservation as we were standing there. My reservation was for 10 minutes later. I showed the hostess and she seated us. Again, wow, but still laughable about how hard this place tries. The check was given to us in an old Hardy Boys book.

The place was packed with Noles and Bulls fans. It honestly felt like we were at a huge Super Bowl party and not a Saturday afternoon random college matchup. \\n\\nWe ordered a couple massive Budweiser Lights to start. I'm not a beer drinker, but when in Rome. Or perhaps I should say when in college. The beers were 32oz each, which is how Bud Light should always be served. \\n\\nCocktails are only $9 each, which is what cocktails should always cost. \\n\\nWe started with spring rolls and nachos to start. I didn't eat any of Kristina's spring rolls because they looked too healthy, but she said they were good. The nachos were loaded and I made a pig of myself. Apps were only $8 each. \\n\\nKristina was full from her spring rolls, but I ordered a Classic Cheeseburger for my entree. The burgers are on the small side (6oz) which means they cook up fast. You can choose between \\"pink\\" or \\"no pink\\". The burger was topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and fancy sauce. The burger was also only $8. \\n\\nOur server was wicked fun, attentive, fast, and even gave us change for the parking meter. \\n\\nI've only bowled at the Dedham location so I can't speak for anything besides the food and drinks at the Boston spot. \\n\\nOverall we had a great time.

The staff was less than stellar, when asked how the pulled pork was the guy said \\" not all that good\\" Really? The place was full of flies. Upon going to the bathroom to wash my hands, I almost lost my cookies. The bathroom was as equally dirty as any truck stop bathroom I have ever seen, it looked as if it had never been clean. There where so many gnat's flying around, it smelt of stale urine, and mildew. I'm not sure who is running the show there but a call to the health department is in order.

Well, the tea place is located underneath a tattoo shop, next to a food truck which the path way will lead you to the bigger spiderhouse venue.
