The anticipation was overwhelming driving from Driftwood halfway down 35 to a trailer on the side of the road. I'm thinking 11am on the money should get us right up to the window. Way wrong, at 11:03 we still waited 30 minutes. For those who plan on standing there with small children remember some form of entertainment besides the folks standing in line with you. A mobile playscape perhaps.\\n\\nOnce you finally get up there; its gratuitous BBQ porn. The guy inquires on your preferences and cuts it to your specs. I have to tell you because of the line and considering I didn't know if I would venture back anytime soon I went overboard on the ordering. A two meat plate with fatty brisket and pork ribs; a pulled pork sandwich just in case. I was eating for two; meals that is. \\n\\nThe pulled pork sandwich was really good; made even better with the slaw on top.  The brisket was perfection; the absolute best I've encountered in a long time. Similar praise for the pork ribs yet I'll reserve top honors because I still think that no name place out in Driftwood deserves the gold medal thanks to the sugar content in their BBQ sauce. Sugar and spices caramelized on meat is a beautiful thing. I liked Franklin's Carolina style vinegar sauce; but the espresso sauce was disappointing. A novelty sauce that didn't amount to its potential if there was any. The slaw with its bite of lemon and the potato salad rounded out a tasty lunchtime meal(s).\\n\\nThe meat should always be the star of any BBQ establishment and Franklin definitely has that aspect covered. Ambiance for an abandoned parking lot proved better than I expected with the pit chugging along and old country standards cutting thru the noise of the freeway. Sitting at a picnic table wasting away in BBQ-Ville came to mind. That's not a bad image once I start thinking about it; chugging down my Dublin Dr. Pepper.

Though I had a lot of condiments on it, I could still taste the flavor of the meat. Unfortunately, near my last two bites, the bun could no longer hold the hot dog due to the slippery-ness of the mustard and ketchup and it broke apart but that was ok as it's finger food and can be eaten any way possible. \\n\\nWe seasoned the fries with the fry seasoning on the table and dipped them in the cheese sauce.

The place looks very cool and is one of its strongest aspects. It is a little hard find as a new comer, hidden on a subsurface level of a well aged building with a partially glass roof covered in vines. The appearance was purposefully rustic which I appreciated and the inside was warm and dim with neutral tones that felt very comfortable. The servers were all very polite and checked on us frequently as we struggled to decipher the exoteric menu options. The drinks were equally complex but we're maybe a little too much for my pallet. The secret burger was sold out, so I probably missed out on the best menu item. We ended up ordering the fried green beans, the pickled pancakes and popcorn, crispy pork belly and New York strip. The green beans were a little too doughy for my liking, but the pancakes were my favorite part of the meal with a nice mix of sour and sweet. The pancakes tasted of cornmeal and went perfectly with the gently sweet and tangy yogurt while the popcorn was crisp and salty offering a nice contrast. The pork belly portion size was pretty small relative to the price, but was decent. The meat wasn't as tender as I'd like but the skin was crispy and reminded me of cracklings, though maybe it was a little too hard, overall the fast was solid. The NY strip was the 10 oz portion so there was enough food but it wasn't the best strip I've had by far in terms of texture nor taste, but once again was pretty solid albeit pricey. Overall I'd say the place looks great, the menu was creative and fun, but the taste wasn't anything too noteworthy and given the food came out in shareable format, the serving size was small, especially when considering that this place is pretty pricey."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

So here's an update.]  \\n\\nWow, this place has gotten really popular - much to my relief (it's successful and still serving great bbq) and my chagrin (it's busy and hard to park now - a small price to pay though).  I guess those billboard advertisements they had up on Ponce and at N. Decatur & Clairmont worked.  Billboards for a bbq joint?  Crazy!\\n\\nAnyway, I've been here many times now.  I've tried a few more things too.  First off, the fries aren't \\"ordinary bag fries\\" as some dismissive jerk wrote - at least they aren't anymore.  Maybe they never were and I was just on the rock when I had them... Anyway, I've had them a few times and they are pretty good though a bit inconsistent - sometimes cooked a little too long, sometimes cooked a little too short, sometimes nicely seasoned and very delicious, sometimes not well seasoned and kinda bland.  So yeah - they are good though.  What's also good is the brisket chili - it is some of the better chili I've had and probably my favorite side on the menu.  Check it out - it is pretty awesome.  The Brunswick stew is also very good here though I've only had it a couple times.  The cornbread with jalapenos and (cream cheese?) is tasty as well.  Also, they seem to put sauce on their wings now but I'm not really a fan - it's easy to asked for them without sauce though.\\n\\nAll the pulled pork and brisket I've had from here since the first few visits has been on point, but the ribs are still a little inconsistent - sometimes they are fantastic, but sometimes they are a little too dry.  I'd like them to be more consistently moist and tender, but I happen to love them even when they are a little too dry.  I'd suggest giving the ribs a couple tries before dismissing them as consistency is an issue here, but I can understand why people might not care for them much period though.  It's just a preference thing - just like I'm not wild about huge, fatty spare ribs or mustard-based bbq sauce.  \\n\\nAlthough I'm very interested in trying them, I still haven't had any of their much-lauded appetizers like the bbq rolls or the Tominator because getting those would just fill me up way too much to have enough room for all the ensuing deliciousness.  I have never had any of the specials here either but I guess I'd be up for trying them at some point - it just seems impossible to go here and not get the bbq.  The brisket burger sound pretty awesome too except that I hate pimento cheese.  Maybe get the brisket burger with the brisket chili instead of the pimento cheese?!  Sounds awesome.\\n\\nDespite some continuing inconsistencies, I always love going here and am totally satisfied everytime.

They make an amazing sushi burrito (as well as rolls) and are always friendly and nice.\\n\\nHowever, over the past few months I have been seriously disappointed in the lack of notice in the turnover. If you are going to remove a business you should remove it from your website so people don't waste their time (especially if you are on lunch) walking all the way there just to learn the place you like no longer operates there.\\n\\nThis has happened twice. Once with the taco spot and most recently FOMO. The most disappointing thing about the FOMO closure is I went with a coworker who is gluten free and loves the fried chicken. We spent 15 minutes of our lunch break walking there to find out they no longer operate out of the complex, and that there are no gluten free options for food. This left us disappointed and in search of a new lunch spot without much time left. \\n\\nThe employees working there didn't seem to care and honestly seemed a bit annoyed at my coworker asking what gluten free options they offerred. Also, you should really rename the slider restaraunt as they don't serve sliders.\\n\\nI understand that turnover happens, but be professional and update your website so people don't waste their time.

Also the sausage was different.  It seemed greasier versus the drier type I liked.  Last time I was here the expresso sauce was \\"forced upon me.\\"  I am not a sauce lover - more of a purest.  But I tried it and loved it.  I dipped my sandwich in it.  This time I could not do that because the sandwich already was too saucy with the meat.  In fact it was so wet that one of my friends removed the meat from the bread as it had gotten so soggy.  My guess is that Franklins may be trying to reduce the wait time.  Well, it does not work.  2 reasons I say this...1) I still waited over 30 minutes from about the same spot I started from the last time. 2) the pre-prepared chop beef is TERRIBLE!  \\nThe stuff we brought home... the sausage - Holmans (I think that is is the brand - found in the HEB refrigerated section is much better if I compare todays sausage to it. Previous visits there was no comparison.  The ribs- my husband who orders ribs just about anywhere, said they were OK.  The brisket - well I thought it was awesome and wished it had been on my sandwich.\\n\\nPotato salad - more \\"mustardy\\" this time.  Tasted almost like a bulk potato salad you muy at Costco or Sam's rahter than homemade. \\n\\nAnd no the heat and waiting time did not get me all hot and bothered about the quality- Franklins has put up another awning so most of the time can be spent in the shade.  However, because my tastebud and texture experience was so different this time than last, I am not sure this place is worth the wait anymore.  I may give it another shot at a less crowded time just to see if today was an off day.    \\n\\nMy companions this time - they thought it was OK.  And the ones who know Joe's in Alvin, Texas (4 of the 6)...said it was NO comparison.  Today, sadly, I had to agree with them!   And my kids who love Joe's did not care for it at all.  I actually have left overs....hummm what to do with them???"},{"name":"The Wild Horse Cafe","address":"392 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"This looks like the old Wild Horse Cafe.

So obviously they have really awesome customer service here. Very good business practices by the owners. But enough about that. The food is INCREDIBLE. My husband is always ordering from the big pizza chains, and I'm always down for a mediocre slice of pizza too, because it's pizza, but this is anything but mediocre.

Sometimes it was hard to flag down carts if you didn't have you game face on or if you are busy in conversation. Over the course of the meal, we got shrimp and pork dumplings, spring rolls, Chinese broccoli, pickled vegetables, sticky rice, pork buns, shrimp wrapped in white rolls, egg tarts, chive dumplings, and a few others that elude me at the moment. For the 11 of us, the total came out to $12 per person including tax and tip. It has been a long time since I've had Chian Pearl and King Fung Garden, but I think I would label Hei La Moon above King Fung and on Par with China Pearl (possibly slightly ahead).

Next came our salads, I had the house with balsamic vinaigrette, purple onion, sliced roma tomatoes and pimento stuffed green olives and greek olives and Ron ordered the caesar salad which we both enjoyed very much. \\n\\nNext came the main courses; I with the baked ziti and sausage and Ron ordered the homemade lasagna. WOW, were both great and portioned for a king! The baked ziti was smothered in fresh ricotta and mozzarella cheeses and the sausage was very flavorful and the perfect accompaniment to the dish. Just note you need to add on the sausage when ordering this dish and in my opinion don't skip it. Ron thoroughly enjoyed his lasagna and commented on how filling it was and after finishing my entree, yea I had to agree; unfortunately there was no room for dessert after this trip to \\"carb heaven\\"!\\n\\nLike I mentioned earlier, we've been dining at Bambinelli's for years, but after moving away from Atlanta back at the end 2011 this was our first time back and good to know that basically nothing has changed and that is good; but one menu item that I was looking for and is no longer on the dessert menu was the spumoni  ice cream; that I would have made room for; I guarantee it!\\n\\nOur server, Kimberly was pleasant and very attentive, great job.

The bbq is so so so so so so good; it doesn't matter what you have here, it's all yummy for the tummy from their bbq sandwiches to their beans to their mac n cheese to their ribs to their chicken to their desert pies. Trust me when I say this, \\"you leave satisfied!\\" SO SO YUMMY.

We asked to move our reservation up 30 min and the hosts were totally gracious. The place started to fill up around 8:00PM. \\nFor starters, we had the fried oysters, cabo tuna roll, and tostadas.  Each had a nice sauce to complement it.  We ordered the margarita pitcher instead of the \\"scorpion/common\\" bowl so we could each hagve our own glasses (the waiter says the scorpion bowl serves more).\\nMains were good, portions were much smaller than I expected, but not a bad thing!  I got the braised pork shoulder, which just melted in the mouth.  I don't each \\"scaly\\" fish but had a nbite of my friend's swordfish, and it almost converted me!\\nWe split the dessert sampler.  the molten chocolate was a little dry (not enough \\"molten\\") but the habanero truffles were so interesting!

Some of our favorite places didn't make it out of their first year. My husband and I lived in Upper Allston ten years ago when the bright red Soul Fire awning went up at 182 Harvard, and we frequented the place, hoping all the while for their success. We moved to Lower Allston five years ago and don't get there as often, but when we do, we find they're just getting better. That red awning has faded to a whitish pink, and Soul Fire has long since worked out its initial kinks, has expanded its menu, gotten its beer & wine license, and settled into its role as area favorite purveyor of great BBQ. I'm so happy to see them thriving. \\n\\nSoul Fire is spacious with lots of roomy tables. They've got a cool ambiance of red walls, dark woods and steel. Two TVs show silent sports (one of the TVs is massive). They have a number of pieces of artwork and a mural of soul artists. They play a steady soundtrack of soul and R&B, and the long bar is decoupaged with soul album covers. \\n\\nThe kitchen is exposed, so you can see funky cooks preparing all those spare ribs, baby back ribs, brisket, catfish, smoked turkey and chicken. They offer a menu of sides that has grown over the years -- collards, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, beans & rice, baked beans, slaw, and have even expanded to offer a range of vegetarian choices, quite accommodating for a BBQ place, in my opinion. They still have the original four killer sauces and everyone has a different fave. They serve on checkered wax paper on flat, round platters.\\n\\nThe menu is an accommodating mix & match affair. Order a salad and a single rib, a half rack, a rack, or order for a table with the \\"feeds 4 souls\\" combo. A meal (say a half rack) comes with two sides of your choice, and always includes their signature pickles and cornbread -- which is so moist and sweet that you should save it for last and eat it as dessert. Unless you want an actual dessert, which they didn't have back when they first opened but have since added...fried dough, pecan pie, cheesecake.  Does anyone have room for dessert after a Soul Fire meal, though? \\n\\nMy husband swears by the brisket or the catfish -- in both cases, either the sandwich or the platter. I'm partial to the half rack of baby back, and I always get the collard greens, which are tangy and a bit on the sweet side. The mac & cheese comes with potato chips crumbled on top, which at first turned me off but I've since grown to like.\\n\\nI have sat at the bar, and I've sat at a table -- many times over the last ten years -- and I've never experienced any poor wait service. Are we just lucky? Or are some Yelpers just impatient? I've always found the servers to be cheerful and competent. \\n\\nAgain, it's Allston, so you roll the dice on finding parking, but Soul Fire is on the green line -- take the B-train to Harvard & Comm. Or the red line to Harvard Square, then the 66 bus practically to Soul Fire's front door.\\n\\nUpdate, Sept 5 2016: \\nSadly just had to cancel a delivery order from Soul Fire. We were lusting after some BBQ awesomeness, because it feels like all I've been doing this weekend is preparing and serving food. But ribs are not to be had. The problem is a 3rd party delivery service called, ironically, Zoomer, that doesn't seem to think 3 hours is an unacceptable ETA. Dear Zoomer -- that's ridiculous. I can be having dinner in Vermont in 3 hours. I've written the owner, who I used to know to say \\"hello\\" to, albeit many years ago. These Zoomer people have a problem, and it's Soul Fire's problem until they pick a different delivery service."},{"name":"Burger & Beer Joint","address":"11662 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"THE BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD!

This greatly impressed my friend as the restaurant is busy.\\n\\nWe both ordered the anchovy caesar salads to start with.  Nice size salads with a anchovy filet on top (just push aside if don't care for anchovies) and zesty, well portioned dressing.  I prefer this salad to ones at many well-liked local restaurants.\\n\\nMy friend had a baked pasta (excellent).  I had the Bombay (curry) penne.  It exceeded my expectations.

I truly believe it is the best in the city.  \\n\\nThe other night I went to Sonsie for a quiet dinner with my friend, Laurie.  Everyone is always so accommodating and friendly at this establishment.  It is always nice to go back.\\n\\nWe started our evening with a bottle of Cote du Rhone to share and looked at the menu.  One of my favorite appetizers on the Sonsie dinner menu is the Vegetable Spring Rolls.  They have been on there forever and my hope is that it stays that way.  We ordered a portion to share.  The spring rolls, are veggie fresh, crunchy, tasty and have a super kick when you add the dipping sauce.  A fantastic appetizer to share or for a light meal for one!\\n\\nI have tried many things on the entr√©e menu from the pastas to superb pizzas and amazing seafood.  This time I picked something a little different and went with the Mee Krob and I am glad I did.  It was soooooo good.  If you like spicy, you will like this wonderful dish of flavors.  Soft Thai Noodles with bean sprouts, full of shrimp, chicken and pork.  No matter how much I tried I couldn't even make a dent in this dish.   I have heard that bigger men have tried without success - a quote from the bartender himself.  The Mee Krob is now on my favorites list!\\n\\nLaurie ordered the Mesclun Salad with Goat Cheese.  This was a very pretty salad to behold full of fresh vegetables wrapped in a circle of cucumber.  Laurie said it was a little too heavy on the EEVO so next time she would ask for dressing on the.  With the added goats cheese (fried), slightly crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside it added a lot more substance to the salad and was perfect for a light entree.\\n\\nAll in all, a nice mid-week evening of dinner with a friend and Sonsie staff who check in on you often to make sure everything is going well - and it was.  \\n\\nI might have to go back again for brunch on Sunday!"},{"name":"Sapporo Sushi Factory","address":"732 N State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"Reading other reviews, it seems that people with bad experiences visited Sapporo for dinner. I have only ever eaten lunch at Sapporo, but I've been a lunch customer for 5 years and I've never been disappointed by a meal. The service is always great and the food is consistently and attentively prepared.\\n\\nThe lunch menu offers a modest selection of very affordable down-home Japanese food. Instead of miso soup, the house serves a rich chicken consomm√© with a few small tempura fried onion rings that is just superb. The portion sizes are perfect.\\n\\nService is paced moderately at Sapporo (typically 45 minutes from order to payment) but if you let your server know you're in a rush, they'll prioritize your meal and speed things up for you.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is casual and quiet. There are a couple of TVs high up on the wall that are either muted or very low volume, usually streaming CNN or other news. The place is furnished in a comfortable and efficient manner consistent with my experience at other Japanese-run restaurants around the US.\\n\\nThings to try:\\n\\n- The two-roll special ($11) is my regular, and the salmon always tastes pretty good.\\n- The miso ramen ($10) is solid.\\n- If you're pretty hungry, the bento combinations ($9-$12) are a good way to go.\\n\\nThings to avoid:\\n\\n- \\"White tuna\\". It's not tuna--it's escolar, and it's very commonly mislabeled. This is a good rule of thumb for any sushi restaurant.\\n- The dinner menu. In my experience, the food is fine but it's pricey for what you get.\\n\\nI love Sapporo.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"After attending the Yelp Elite party at No Mas a few weeks ago, I really wanted to go back and try out the restaurant for real. Not to say the yummy all you can eat and drink buffet was fake or anything, but I was excited to try out an actual sit-down-and-order-off-the-menu sort of thing.\\n\\nMichael and I were to have dinner with another couple- I suggested No Mas. We arrived on a rainy evening and found the restaurant to have just a handful of occupied tables. We were seated right away at a nice cozy table in a corner of the main dining area. Personally, I loved the awesome high back, heavy, wooden chairs. They evoked a memory of my five year old self sitting proudly at the table with my parents at Casa Bonita- but that's another story.\\n\\nOur waiter was quite happy to be serving us, or at least that's the impression she projected. Attentive, helpful, friendly. She gave us plenty of time to review the menu, was not pushy at all when we needed more time, and worked to pace the evening quite well.\\n\\nOne of our dinning buddies and I ordered the standard margarita, which was good. Not overly sweet and just enough tequila to let you know it's there. I've had better, I've had worse. This one was a solid \\"good\\". The complimentary chips were also good. The star of the pre-meal entertainment was definitely the salsa. Spicy and complex, sort of smoky and very delicious. Had I no inhibitions, I would have taken the bowl all to myself and left the others to eat dry chips.\\n\\nI ordered the Spinach Enchiladas with the $2 grilled chicken up-sell. I found the enchiladas to be delightful, despite the cream sauce which I would typically find to be a little objectionable. The side of beans and rice were nothing remarkable. In fact, I don't even remember eating them. Perhaps they were bland and uninspired, or perhaps the enchiladas were so incredibly good as to over shadow.\\n\\nMichael ordered a trio of chicken enchilada, taco and tamale. He seemed to like his dinner, nothing objectionable, only praise. Of our dinner buddies, one seemed to enjoy his meal of shrimp with something else and the other dinner buddy seemed to be unimpressed by his fish taco. But, I didn't sample either, so I can't really speak definitely as to either.\\n\\nOne of the dinner buddies order dessert: a plate of freshly fried sopaipillas served with ice cream. Yum. I've never had sopaipilla quite like these; they were very flaky, light and not really bread like. Sort of like pie crust with yeast. However they were created, they were quite good.\\n\\nOverall, I am a fan.

The ravioli were tough like they were undercooked and they only had a thin sliver of meat inside. I received about six pieces mixed in with some spinach and tomato for $16.

She also asked for Brussels sprouts on it or on the side. They first brought her chicken pasta--not vegetarian. After about 15 minutes, they brought a veggie-only dish (mostly broccoli stems, FYI) but no sprouts.\\n\\nService: Server was mildly attentive. He refilled drinks, took orders, etc. His mistake of the pasta dish was unpleasant, especially when he did not appear very busy and chatted with the hostesses for a bit. He also did not know the wine list well, but I'm not holding that against him at a non-wine-centered restaurant, just an FYI for wine people.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Metal music from the 80s.

She discounted my breakfast without my even asking, gave me my breakfast, and sent me off with a smile. I don't exactly know why they were understaffed, but I can only assume minimum wage employees who barely make enough to take care of their families have very little motivation to come to work.

The most recent visit restored our faith in No Mas.\\n\\nPreviously, service was robotic and awkward and our server lacked the most basic social skills.  The owners were in desperate need of training for their service staff.  This time we had a delightful waitress who engaged in our playful banter and provided seamless, relaxed service and it definitely made for a more delightful meal.\\n\\nOn an earlier visit, the atmosphere was raucous, the restaurant filled with groups of 10, 12, 20 or more celebrating birthdays, a girls night out, prom dinner and any occasion where more's the merrier.  Our two top felt terribly out of place.  This time the restaurant was festive but filled with more traditional groups of three or four, although as the night wore on, tables were being pulled together for parties of 10 and 15.  And atmosphere is important here, with eye-popping d√©cor making it unique and unlike anything else in Atlanta.  The owner's passion and love for all things Mexican is evident in the details used to carry out the theme.\\n\\nOur table commented that on previous visits our food was decent, but not dazzling, and while we liked it fine, other Mexican restaurants had more flavorful food that satisfied us better.  This visit, though, provided the best food we've had yet.  We started with chips and salsa - light, crispy chips accompanied by a bowl of smoky chipotle salsa.  We added a guacamole appetizer, a bowl of creamy, slightly chunky avocado with a pile of diced tomatoes on the side plus a lemon wedge.  We mixed it all together and three baskets of chips later we testified that this was one terrific appetizer.\\n\\nTwo of us got the combination platter, where you put together your own mix of tacos, enchiladas and tamales with a choice of sauces.  I got the Playa del Carmen, a plate that comes with two shrimp enchiladas with a light cream sauce, plus a fried fish taco.  I kept the rice but subbed mixed veggies for the refried beans and they were superb.  All-in-all a lighter meal that was full of flavor.  Perhaps new hands in the kitchen are better equipped to deliver great Mexican food.\\n\\nWe used a $30 Groupon with no problem and since another one of our party bought the same Groupon, we'll be returning again and reporting on whether they've maintained the higher standard."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Good cheap burgers, fries, and shakes.

The bartender from the first time we were there was nowhere to be found, instead we had an excellent bartender named Jason who was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, conversational, and more than lived up to the standard this bar sets out to achieve.  It appears the management has worked out some of the kinks from the opening, a very promising sign that they're responding to their customers and actively looking to improve.  \\n\\nOur experience otherwise was similar to the first time we were there, it was full but not overcrowded, they do a nice job of keeping the \\"capacity\\" at a very manageable number that allows everyone to breathe inside.  This was on a Saturday night between 11:00 and midnight, so it was certainly one of their busiest times.  \\n\\nAs I had suspected, the previous subpar experience we had at Wink & Nod was largely tied to the bartender working that night, and much less to the overall bar itself.  The drinks we had on our return trip were much better made, properly mixed, and worth their price tag.  We asked the bartender for a recommendation, and he took the time to ask about our taste preferences, what we were in the mood for, and recommended a drink that ended up being an excellent decision.  Upon asking him to create something on his own from a few ingredients, he whipped up an awesome concoction that was more than worthy of being on the menu.  He even went so far as to properly handle a couple of intoxicated patrons who stumbled in later on, and were upset when he wasn't familiar with the very obscure drink they asked for that wasn't on the menu. (I Googled on my phone, there was virtually no trace of it anywhere - so it's completely understandable that he hadn't heard of it)  He asked them what was in it, figured out how to make it and did so.  While putting it together, they drunkenly were talking about how terrible they expected it to be since he didn't know of the drink when they asked.  He kept a cool head despite obviously being able to hear them, and it turned out they both loved it.  That's quality commendable service.  \\n\\nGoing forward, this bar has a lot of potential, with a few minor tweaks.  The drink menu could be expanded to encompass a more broad taste palate.  It's a tad heavy on (albeit very good) fruit-sweet-whiskey combinations right now.  I'm not sure how much of a \\"speakeasy\\" it is, though to call it a normal bar would be selling it short.  If they wanted to move further into the speakeasy category, adding some more rustic elements and removing the signage outside would push it further in that direction.  Though as it stands now, the decor and aura of the place is excellent as a high-end bar.  \\n\\nI would absolutely return here for a third visit, and look forward to seeing the bar progress further."},{"name":"Berkshire Farms Market","address":"1 Harborside Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Loved the artisanal cheese platter that I took to eat on my long stretch home from Iceland!

I felt like at roughly $4 for 2 samosas that the price point was too high for that offering I had some sort of tandoori chicken for dinner with a garlic naan. The chicken came with plenty of vegetables which I thought was great and the naan wasn't too bad either. Again, though, I would have liked to have seen some chutney.

We got there at about 8:15 and had planned to see Black Swan at Midtown Arts Cinema (awesome movie, btw) at nearly 10.   The place was packed and service, as a result (I'm guessing) was very slow.

Had the mushroom pizza and the bolognese pasta.  There were plenty of people there for dinner.  The service was fine, not stellar, and the food was pretty good.  \\n\\nWent back this past weekend and I guess they had people in the kitchen who had never cooked before.  First of all, we were there on a weekend afternoon and the place was empty.  There were a few tables outside but inside was totally dead.  And I know why!  We ordered pretty quickly: grilled chicken salad and a grilled chicken sandwich.  Should have come out within 10 minutes, right?  I don't think so.  We waited 20 minutes (meanwhile no bread was served, and when we asked the waitress what was up with the long wait, she didn't seem too concerned and said the food would be out within a few more minutes).  Remember, the place was empty...why would it take so long to make what we ordered?\\n\\nFinally the food arrives and my boyfriend takes one look at the salad with its charred chicken, and takes one bite and rejects it for being cold (and burned!).  And he's not a picky eater.  \\n\\nMy plate doesn't look too appetizing either.  I take a bite of my sandwich and it doesn't taste quite right.  I pull apart the chicken a bit, and discover that IT IT RAW inside.  Ew!  The \\"rosemary fries\\" were a joke.  They were limp and covered in some type of powder which I guess was supposed to make them taste like something.  THE WORST FRIES I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED, and I am known to try fries from time to time. I am definitely sending my plate back too.  Good thing I didn't have more than a bite of the chicken or I probably would have gotten sick. Lesson learned: always inspect your food a bit, especially if it looks suspect!  Thanks Chef Ramsay for teaching me this a la Kitchen Nightmares!\\n\\nWe are quite hungry and want to use this second Groupon we have which expires in a couple weeks, so we decide to order something else.  We go for the mushroom pizza since we'd ordered that a few weeks before and it had been ok.  \\n\\nIn the meantime, the staff brings out some random appetizers we are told are \\"really good.\\"  They are on the house to make up for the raw and burned food they'd served us. One plate is arancini.  It is soggy and watery.  Certainly the worst I've ever tasted.  One bite is enough.  The other dish is an antipasto, also the worst I have ever had.  There is a big pile of eggplant (which I don't even like), the strangest looking bruschetta I have ever laid eyes on (what was even in it?  Minced onions and something else doused in balsamic vinegar and thrown on top of a rubbery, hard to chew piece of foccacia?? certainly no sign of tomatoes), tasteless slices of mozzerella and proscuitto, and the only edible thing of the whole experience: artichoke hearts with crumbled feta.  Note: the artichoke hearts required no cooking!  Not to mention, that would be pretty hard to mess up.\\n\\nNext the pizza comes out...soggy, falls apart when you pick it up, has big clumps of goat cheese on it, and tomato sauce that looks like they dumped a can of tomato paste on a piece of wet cardboard.  I had never seen such disgusting looking pizza before.  At this point I have to call the chef over and ask him what on earth is going on.  This is like a bad joke!  Luckily, we get the value of our Groupon back, since there is no way we are going to be able to eat anything they are cooking!  We go home hungry with an hour wasted.

Upon entering, my eyes were pleased by the intimate lighting and expectingly glanced into the glimpse of the kitchen peeking from behind the bar. The decor in SCK is warm and inviting yet crisp, with ambiance actually making me feel like I stepping into the kitchen of a familiar place, and not a new restaurant.\\n\\nWe were seated outside on the patio, and the staff (including my waiter) were very attentive without being annoying. I'm the kind of diner that wants you to notice when my glass is empty or a plate needs to be cleared, but not to ask me how everything is going every 5 minutes. It seems like during my visit, SCK found the perfect balance of this, and it actually allowed me to enjoy my family and my dining experience. \\n\\nBefore my meal, I ventured upstairs to the restroom, and was actually glad I hadn't had anything to drink. Although it was only two flights of stairs (I believe...), the steps felt a little steep to me. Maybe it was the heels I had on, but I couldn't help but feeling like there should be a spotlighted button for me to push and have Moira tell me I won some prize, Nickelodeon's GUTS style. Despite the absence of any dry ice looming around, the upstairs diners seemed to be enjoying themselves, and seemed to enjoy the view. \\n\\nNow, I am a southern girl, and there's two things that I'm finicky about. My cornbread and my biscuits. It takes a lot to make this biscuit connoisseur happy, and SCK tackled the task. I loved the corn kernels  in the muffins (just the way I like 'em!) and the biscuit (which had gotten cold by the time I convinced myself that I would hit the gym later in exchange for a taste) was still tasty and not crunchy. Thumbs up. \\n\\nTo dine, I ordered the Boneless Chicken Thighs with the jalapeno corn pudding and SCK greens. The chicken was on point and I loved the greens (although a scrawny portion), but where was the jalapeno in my corn pudding? I'm the type of girl that loves a kick, but there was none to be had here. I sampled mom's trout which was delish, and my bro devoured the mac n' cheese, but left some meatloaf there. He said it was \\"alright...\\", but I never eat anybody's meatloaf but my mama's anyway. \\n\\nDesert: Black Currant Sorbet = hella too sweet. I know I've been laying off the sugar for a while, but isn't the culinary purpose of sorbet is to taste some fruit? I felt my blood sugar hit an immediate high and couldn't finish more than a few bites. I tasted my mom's bread pudding though, and it was yummy. I knew I should've ordered the banana pudding and just tacked another hour onto the gym...\\n\\nIn conclusion, (9th grade paper style), SCK gives you a comfy meal in a comfy place with comfy service. Mom said she enjoyed her meal and it was quite tasty, so I'm happy. I'll be back for brunch."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"First off, I was warned of the extraordinary wait time for Sunday brunch, but we were determined to go and had our morning coffee outside while waiting. \\n\\nWe finally sat on the heated and covered outside patio on picnic style benches.

It fits into Austin very well. We went to the location off 35 north, right next to our beloved Jimmy John's. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, why their lines were so long and why it was always busy there. \\n\\nFreebirds has a whole \\"hippie\\" feel to it, and I love that they let their employees be themselves. No uniforms, tattooes, whatever. It can really build up morale and loyalty. In another sense, a little too much freedom can cause the flaws I saw in the chain. \\n\\nThe decor was funky and fun to look at, different old signs, stickers, artwork. The signage for the meal options however was kind of confusing and lacking. They have alot to offer, however, it is not all listed. Chipotle, has a nice flow of signage and it's easy to understand and move quickly down the line. Freebirds taco/burrito fillings are not listed, leaving you staring through the glass, and visiting for a meal during a peak period can leave your lunch lacking something that would have made it taste much better. \\n\\nI observed alot of things that were signs of too much freedom and not enough management. The trashes in the kitchen were all overflowing in plain view, there were empty broken down boxes on the floor in the kitchen, there was a catering platter of salad on the top of a metro shelf that is a storage shelf. It was about 5 inches away from touching a dusty ceiling. It stood there for the entire hour we were there, and remained there when we left. I bet there were some extra bits of protien in there (flies) after that. \\n\\nThe staff are very friendly, but after seeing alot of disorganized and un managed practices, I can see where \\"having too much fun\\" at work makes the operation suffer. \\n\\nThey offer a great and very competitive lunch deal, two tacos, chips and a drink for $5.00. That could be the deal that promotes more positive growth for them, however, they have to fix their flaws for it to help push them to a higher grade/more desirable of choice for a destination.\\n\\nMy tacos were plain, the salsas I had were all lacking. The corn salsa had no citrus and barely any salt. The pico lacked salt and citrus, the chicken was very plain, the pork was very plain, rice was plain. The only thing that helped was their BBQ sauce, which was actually tangy and tasty. It helped, but after I disected everything, it really showed their lack of giving all of their food something extra. Nothing stands out. \\n\\nI really wanted to give two stars, however, I see the opportunity here and will give them the extra star making it three because they are close to being great.

It is right on Newbury Street, which gets tons of foot traffic, and it is set up much like a European cafe with an open front.  Therefore it is best to go here in the summer when they open the front of the restaurant.  It's a great place to just kick back and observe. The last time I was there some chode pulled up in a white Lamborghini and gave it over to the valet, and they couldn't figure out how to turn it back on after he walked into the restaurant!  Comedy gold.  The time before that I sat at the bar with my dad next to a man who claimed to be an oddsmaker for a casino in Las Vegas (I believed him because he had a really gaudy gold Rolex on).  This place attracts interesting characters like a magnet.\\n\\nOn my most recent visit I went with some girlfriends and we shared a plain pizza, a Mexican chicken pizza and the warm olive appetizer.  It was really delicious and fun to share.  We also ordered cocktails.  I had a margarita which was to die for and then I had the Sangria.  The Sangria was AWESOME.  The salads here are also very good.  Another perk of Sonsie is that they frequently change the menu so that each time you go you can try something new.\\n\\nIn closing, if you are looking for a fun place to go and people watch while having a great meal Sonsie is for you.

We had a difficult time whittling our choices down, and ended up with the pickled corn pancakes, the smoked pigs' tails, the smoked whitefish rillettes on a bagel, and the peanut salted-caramel cinnamon bun. Everything was delicious. I loved how both the \\"sweet\\" dishes had a savory element as well, and the pickled corn pancakes especially were unlike anything else I'd ever had before. The smoked pigs' tails were amazing - their slightly crunchy texture mixed wonderfully with the runny poached egg and the creamy grits. \\n\\nThe drinks were also amazing. One of my dining mates declared that the Bloody Mary was one of the best he'd ever had (and apparently he's quite the Bloody Mary fan, so that's high praise!). I ordered from the regular cocktail menu and chose the Springfield, a deceptively light and floral cocktail that packed a lot of punch.\\n\\nOur server was nice and helpful in explaining the menu, if extremely difficult to hear sometimes (he spoke really, really quietly), and dishes arrived promptly.

Turkey was excellent, also the best I have ever tasted. All of the sides were tasty as well.  The pinto beans were exceptional. Just a touch peppery as they should be. All in all, a top notch experience.

Fried Catfish flaky and delicious. Never greasy, always amazing. Tartar sauce FTW.\\n2. Pulled Pork; yes, please! Even without any sauce it's got that smoky meaty thang going on good on its own, on top of coleslaw, or wrapped up in a slice of white bread. \\n1. BABY BACK RIBS!!!! Skip the spare ribs (unless that's your thing), I want my baby back baby back baby back baby back.... So meaty and perfect. So very perfect. Love these ribs!\\n\\nAs far as sides go, I find them less impressive than the meat. They'd be 5-Star if they could master the sides.  We pretty much stick with the collard greens and coleslaw. Macaroni isn't as great as some reviews would have you think, at least in my opinion. Baked beans lack significant flavor. The corn bread is solid.

The crab and corn were really complementary - both were delicious. The butter was delicious and not overpowering. But it might have been worthwhile to add something with some color - everything looked the same - and we definitely needed more crackers.\\n\\nSarsaparilla Braised Short Rib ($14) (Refried red beans, grilled oyster mushrooms, bacon jam): The short rib itself was super tender, but we felt that there needed to be a carb or starch added for some more depth. The mushrooms didn't add a ton.\\n\\nSuckling Pig Fries ($13) (Poutine gravy, cheddar cheese curds, cayenne pork rinds, fresh horseradish): The spice level of this dish was great. We would have liked to have some aspect of sweetness for a good contrast, perhaps by adding a sweet potato frie instead.\\n\\nNew Orleans BBQ Shrimp ($15) (Creamy jalapeno grits, holy trinity, andouille): The grits could have been more creamy, and the BBQ was super overpowering. Not impressed.\\n\\nOysters of the day ($3 each): We didn't care for the mayo sauce that came on the side, and we would have liked some horseradish. The lemon itself was super hard to squeeze.\\n\\nCast Iron Duck Confit & Dumplings ($16) (Root vegetables, dark roux, chives): The stewed portion was delicious, but there was barely any duck flavor. The dumplings themselves were fluffy and perfect.\\n\\nCocktails: I had the Whodi Smash ($14) (Woodford bourbon, fresh lemon, mint, apricot syrup), which was delicious, but it got super watery, so much so that I couldn't finish it.\\n\\nFresh Fried Beignets ($10) (Powdered sugar): Fluffy, perfect, with a side of vanilla butter.\\n\\nButterscotch Biscuit Bread Pudding ($9) (Peanut butter whiskey sauce): We wished the peanut butter was more evenly distributed, especially since it was was too dark inside of the restaurant to see where it was. The bread pudding wasn't fluffy enough, and it was overwhelmingly sweet. Wouldn't recommend.\\n\\nIn terms of atmosphere itself, our water and cocktail glasses were beautiful, but it was so dark that we couldn't clearly see all of our food.

I love to. It's one of my favorite things to do. Yesterday I went there for lunch and got the turkey sandwich.¬†What I got was two pieces of bagged white bread, some dry turkey formed into a baseball shape in the center of that bread, a smear of Duke's mayo and single piece of lettuce (I asked to hold the tomato). It was $9.50. And this was the \\"small\\" one - the larger one is $13. Not even in New York City or San Francisco is THIS kind of sandwich $10 or $13. Hell, I could go to Dubai and get a better value for my American dollar. The bread was even a little stale - no cheese (extra), no chips. If it's the half pickle that makes it $5 more than it should be then you should have an option to not get one. There's no argument that could convince me that this is anything other than a $5 sandwich. It just isn't.\\n\\nI don't mind paying $10 to even $15 for a sandwich either, but it should be something even a little bit special. A $10 sandwich in Avondale should be - fresh house made turkey, house baked bread, lettuce, avocado, maybe some kind of house made spread, sprouts (or something), and a side of house made chips. If you're saying \\"please, he wants to serve a plain white bread turkey and mayo sandwich.\\" Fine. Then charge $5.99 and everyone is happy. As an example - Oakhurst Market nearby - house roasted turkey, havarti, cucumbers, sprouts, avocado, mayo, whole grain mustard on steckie - FOR SEVEN DOLLARS. \\n\\nI get that making money is the point of owning a restaurant.

You can get a fried pork chop for one of your sides!!!!  Then there is the organics menu, which is 4 or 5 special items with fresh and seasonal ingredients that all looked amazingly intriguing.  We ended up with the mac and cheese, the chicken and andouille jambalaya, chanterelle mushrooms and greens and the roasted rainbow carrots.  The fried chicken was amazing. It is very simple with plain mashed potatoes, braised greens and gravy on the side.  The chicken is definitely the highlight of the dish, it's perfectly crispy and has just enough heat in the breading.  The mac and cheese is a must have and the jambalaya was surprising full of flavor!  \\n\\nOur waiter seemed overwhelmed with his section, even though it was only two tops!  But he was hard to get a hold of when we needed something.  But when he did bless us with his presence, he was helpful and informative.    All in all this place has great food, but maybe spotty service, oh wait this is Portland!  I have not yet been here for breakfast but I do hear that it is fantastic.  \\n\\n\\nP.S. Attention management: don't let your servers bring food to tables in a tank top!!!!  I don't care how hot it is running around a little restaurant, even more reason to be wearing sleeves of some sort!!!!"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Again Ramen Tatsu Ya never disappoints.

This is a very popular place in Harvard Square. They will call you to confirm that you're coming and there's very little room for adjusting the reservation due to the popularity\\n- If you want the secret burger, I suggest making an early reservation because they only make 30 or so burgers and once they run out, they won't make any more.

Our waitress was excellent and right on top of everything we needed, starting with the wine. She recommended a bottle of the 2007 PepperBridge Cabernet Sauvignon, a little spendy but an excellent choice.\\n\\nWe started with the Smoked Rainbow Trout and Remoulade appetizer and shared a cup of their Manhattan Clam Chowder and their House Salad with Glazed Walnuts and Bleu Cheese Crumbles. The trout was amazing and a perfect appetizer. I've never had Manhattan Clam Chowder before so this was a new experience for me and is my new love, I'll be back to Jake's just for the clam chowder alone, A+.\\n\\nFor the main course, I had one of their signature dishes, the Oven Roasted Pacific Salmon that was stuffed with Dungeness Crab, Shrimp, and Brie Cheese.

The salmon came paired with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, and carrots, \\n\\nFor dessert, we shared a few bites of the Key Lime Pie which was also delicious and the Chocolate Bag which is not only delicious, but a work of art.

By far the best judge of how exceptional the service is was when my waiter asked me \\"Are you still enjoying your dish\\" instead of asking \\"Are you still working on that?\\" which is one of my biggest annoyances (eating should never be considered work).

The food was delicious, but we had a very strange experience with the service, due to which I don't think I will be returning here. \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of wine. Ten minutes later, our server tells us that they had trouble finding the wine in the cellar, but tracked it down at last. He opens the bottle quickly, without showing us the label or anything, and leaves it at the table after pouring into our glasses (again skipping the tasting step). We look at the bottle, its not even close to the same wine. We tell the server that he brought the wrong wine, to which he responds it was just a diff year of the same wine. We point to the bottle and explain that we ordered a Bordeaux, and this is a wine from Washington. The server looks confused and finally admits that they gave us a diff bottle. That's fine, at least we are all on the same page now. \\n\\nSo we tell the server we are OK with this bottle as long as the price is the same or less, a reasonable request considering they brought the wrong bottle, refused to admit it for a while, and by-passed the regular presentation of the bottle so we wouldn't notice it until we started drinking. The server assures us that the price will be the same. \\n\\nThe check comes. And of course the price is not the same, its $8 more. So we call the server over to point out that, although we already discussed the price and were assured it would not be more expensive, it was. The server, before even looking at the check, asks if our question is about the extra $8. Meaning he knew that the extra charge was on the check, brought it over anyways, even after we discussed how the wine was the wrong bottle. Sounds like he knew he brought the wrong bottle, but tried to sneak it by us anyway. He ended up talking to a manager and removing $12 off the bill. Why $12? Why not the whole bottle or just the $8? Very odd number. \\n\\nThe whole experience made us feel like the server was trying to pull a fast one on us. All because he couldn't find the bottle we ordered, although we were perfectly fine with getting a similar bottle for the same price.

I didnt have time to pick up stuff which worked out because they have lawn chairs for the first handful. I really recommend getting here latest 8am. The reason for this is because you will be part of the first 50 under the shed where you have a selection of chairs. By the time I got there around 7:50, there were only a chair or two left. I also made it under the shade. If I had arrived at 8:30 or so, I would have to be in the the blazing sun for four hours. Make sure to pack some cards, sunglasses, reading material, or whatever. I took a few naps here and there and played some cards. While you wait, a lady comes and picks up your tentative order. This allows them to estimate how much meat they will be able to supply to customers so if you are at the way end with no chance, you dont have to wait.

It came out to 50 bucks\\n3/4 lb brisket\\n1/2 lb ribs (4 ribs)\\n1/4 lb turkey\\n1/4 lb pulled pork\\n1 sausage\\nBanana Pie\\nSmall potato salad\\n\\nBy the time we finished we had leftovers of all but the ribs and sausage.

The potato salad and pie were ok too. I thought the brisket and ribs were good but nothing blew my socks off. I can tell they put in a lot of work and everyone is really nice.

Our decision was easy.\\n\\nI hadn't been to Border in quite some time and forgot how huge this place is inside. Easily accessible from the T and just a few steps away from Harvard Square, Border Cafe has some of the best Tex-Mex food in the area. Free chips, delicious guacamole, and blackened chicken that lives up to its reputation can all be found here. My friends ordered quesadillas and were both impressed with their meals.\\n \\nOverall this place has reasonable prices (the three of us ate for around $40 combined with tip) if you stay away from the margaritas, which look like they can add up fast (didn't want to start that at 1PM).

It wasn't a Franklin's BBQ magnitude line but one that still added 20-30 minutes to a normal lunch.\\n\\nService was friendly, fun, and ordering was quick and painless.  We were 'assigned' four seats at a table taking up the last four available at that table.  As I started to sip on my water, I noticed some nasty looking stains on my glass.  I took the glass back up to the counter and got a replacement.  The replacement also had a bad food stain, so they replaced it again.  Two dirty glasses in a row - bad start.\\n\\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu.  The bowls came out fairly quickly and were served at a decent temperature.  Even with the soy sauce blend, however, the pork bone broth was a bit too rich for my taste and lacked character and seasoning.  I can't say it was bad, just not even close to mind-blowing as I've heard it to be.  The ingredients seemed of fair to good quality.  The noodles tasted like nothing more than pre-packaged noodles.  Overall it was OK ramen.  I would eat it over instant ramen.\\n\\nI will probably give Ramen Tatsuya another try if there isn't a long line.

We were in the hibachi section. Our waitress arrived as soon as we sat down. As an appetizer, while we waited for our table to get fuller, we ordered one of their House Special Rolls, the Dragon roll ($13.95). It was SOOOO GOOD! Definitely gotta try this! I got the Sea of Japan entree ($27.95), comes with lobster, scallops and shrimp. My husband ordered the Surf and Turf ($27.99), filet mignon and lobster. All entrees are served with your choice of soup, a house salad, white steamed rice (fried rice is $2.95 extra), vegetables and 3 complimentary shrimp. The show the Chef did was cool, very funny. It was unfortunate there weren't more people at our table, as you tend to have more fun with others. We had our privacy though. The rice was awesome, just enough soy sauce and not too dry either. The vegetables were very good too, I wish they would have given me a bit more as it was mostly onions. Our meats were cooked very well. Although I felt the lobster was a bit overcooked, maybe that's not the best way to eat it. I prefer it steamed and dip it in butter! Overall, I definitely recommend you dining in.

I highly recommend this place, but if you're concerned about this, just be sure to ask them to show you the ingredients they're using.

The momos were great, although I did not care for the sauce (not bad, just not my thing).  The service was excellent and attentive.  My only gripe was the industrial decor and the fluorescent lighting.   Gives the place a cafeteria feel and does not encourage lingering.

So, when we saw driving by a couple of months ago that a \\"steakhouse\\" had opened at the Shilo, we had a good chuckle. But desperate for any decent new restaurants in the SW Portland/Beaverton area, I Googled it and saw all the great reviews. Immediate thought: they clearly paid more than a few people because there's no way that a nice quality steakhouse with great drinks and food opened in the Shilo with this many consistently positive reviews. But guess what? It's true. We had an impromptu family celebration tonight and for reasons I won't go into, this seemed like the perfect place to go. Half expecting disappointment, it was a wonderful experience all around. The hostess was lovely, and we immediately connected with her as part of the neighborhood with shared connections. The service was awesome, and the old fashioned was as good, if not better, than any you'll get at the best of PDX restaurants. The wine list was also impeccable. The dinners were very yummy. Such a friendly, cozy place with awesome food. We met one of the owners on the way out who was incredibly gracious and thankful for our patronage.

The staff is absolutely fabulous and provided the most memorable service of any chain I believe I have ever visited. The first member greeted me warmly asking my name and then asked if I had ever been to Clover, after responding that I had not his enthusiasm escalated instantly. He was eager to introduce each of the menu offerings to me, make recommendations, and give helpful tips. One of the tips was trying the strawberry beverage products as they are in season right now. I tried the strawberry lemonade and it was both refreshing and flavorful. The staff member then went above and beyond, using my name and then offering me a sampling of the strawberry soda which was also fantastic. Could not go wrong with either! \\n\\nFast forward to receiving my food and again another staff member was equally as passionate in delivering phenomenal service, again referring to me by name just from memory! As for the food, I really enjoyed it! All of the ingredients were fresh and offered great quality. The chickpea fritter was fantastic! It was comprised of perfectly cooked falafel and then topped off with tahini and lots of veggies. There were so many different components that worked surprisingly well together, from pickled carrots and red cabbage to fresh pieces of cucumber and tomato. It was perfect!

I walked in and the service was friendly and quick. This place is small and cozy....very small and cozy. I think most people end up going to eat at Village idiot next door.

I got my meal Togo since I wasnt in a drinking mood and the space is a tad bit too cozy for me. I like my space so I can take pics and be that annoying foodie writing reviews on Yelp as I eat ;). The mozz sticks weren't my favorite. They werent bad, but definitely not on my top 10 list. The vegan cheese was a little too gooey and gooey which is weird to say, but I felt there was a 5:1 cheese:breading ratio and I feel like the breading is an important factor for a good Mozzarella stick. They needed about half the amount of cheese. The wings were good. COLD. But good. I think they could be great served Hot. I'm not sure if I was served leftover wings maybe from a customer before me or if they just typically serve them cold. But I'm sure they taste great fresh out the fryer.

You can definitely split the sandwich with another person, or save some for later. This restaurant has multiple sauce options, but my favorite by far was the spicy bbq. It was a great add on to my pulled pork sandwich. The restaurant itself is cute and homey. It's always busy - so I'd come a bit early and be prepared to wait. Alternatively, you can grab a drink at the bar."},{"name":"Eden Burger","address":"1437 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place so much.

Would recommend, but eat them while they're hot bc the texture isn't as good if not. The fries were great, maybe a lil salty but eh it's all good. I opted for the \\"Bacon Ranch\\" tempeh sandwich.

They host incredible talent and you can see internationally renowned bands in a cozy outdoor setting complete with drinks and delicious BBQ. Can't go wrong there! I've seen several concerts at Stubbs and they were all amazing. They can get pretty crowded but since the venue is outdoors there's plenty of space to spread out while still having an awesome view of the stage. Not to sound like an old fogey but the music isn't too loud either. It's almost like the band is playing just for you - except you're surrounded by pumped up concert goers.

The dining room seating is an adventure in itself-kill or be killed.  The flavor of the food was good but like another review had mentioned, it's all mashed together on an oversized metal tray.  That was odd.  The mac/chz sauce was very runny that came on the biscuit but on the side order, the pasta shape is different & that one tasted better.  ? We had the 7th trimester biscuit-it was okay.  The biscuit was crumbly. It wasn't very warm, which was hard to get as we waited 15 minutes for our food.  The bacon was under cooked for my taste so again, have to ask for well done if you like it crisper.  We also had the meatloaf sandwich.  That was great but there was hardly any mashed potato on the bread-don't believe what the menu tells ya. The soda was good.  The bakery items were just okay.  Yep, just okay.  We had a coconut cream mini pie-the crust was awful.  It was so salty & the coconut needed some sugar.  The oatmeal pie had a weird taste-I didn't enjoy that.  The bar cookie was okay-just okay.  The chocolate chip cookies the same.  Okay.  We also had the brownie-and again, just okay.  It was expensive.  I was hoping to have my socks blow off but it was just a ruffle-the meatloaf sandwich (with making sure the mashed potatoes are added properly) & the soda are really just the two things that would make me return.

We've wanted to check out Revival for a while for their dinner, but figured out our ideal time to meet would be Sunday during the day so why not brunch. Long story short: poor service, overpriced items BUT there are some must-orders from their brunch menu. I'd be willing to give dinner service a try, but probably would not come back here for brunch.\\n\\nWe had reservations at 11:15 on Sunday and although we were early, I could see that they couldn't handle brunch. The host/hostess were clearly underwater with managing tables/reservations and I actually got some attitude for being early. Our waiter never intro'd himself and didn't take any drink orders until we had been sitting at the table for what seemed like 20 min AND he didn't offer. We had to ASK for coffee while he was refilling the table's coffee next to us. Our orders didn't get to us much later and our waiter only served us when his other tables' had left. I recall him saying to us \\"Now would be a good time to order.\\" Really? Now? We were ready but you never stopped by for us.\\n\\nWhat we ate:\\n\\nCathead Biscuit - WORTH it. Probably the best item on the menu for brunch.\\n\\nCinnamon Roll - Huge, definitely shareable. Delicious when it's warm and I'd recommend it for your brunch \\"dessert.\\" Goes well with coffee.\\n\\nAlmost Famous Chicken Sandwich - This showed up and I immediately felt ripped off. I expected one large sandwich and not two mini chicken sliders. The sandwiches were served on bread similar to King's Hawaiian rolls. This plate was $10. So...each little slider was like $5. Not even any sides come with this. \\n\\nGussied Up Mac and Cheese - Because why wouldn't you order mac if it's on the menu? This was disappointing for how bland it was. From what I could tell, it's gussied up because of the crunched up Lay's potato chips sprinkled on top. This little serving was $4. If it were 2.50 or even $3, it would make sense, but the macaroni is made up with cut up bits of macaroni. Even if it's available during dinner service, I would never get this again.\\n\\nFried Egg Sandwich - Served on rye with pork and crispy kale. this was ok. \\n\\nFrench toast - The bread was solid and never got too soggy from the fruit compote and whipped cream. Generous serving, but nothing wow about it.\\n\\nI can't say enough about how bad service was. One of our friends asked for jam to go with a biscuit and our waiter never came back with it. I hate being the demanding table, but we were very much ignored during our time there. \\n\\nAgain, I'd be interested coming back to try dinner which is maybe where they shine, but if you're here for breakfast, get the Cathead Biscuit, Cinnamon Roll and then call it a day."},{"name":"Emerald Point Bar & Grill","address":"5973 Hiline Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"We just love this place.

Like a restaurant, they have a full food menu and regular tables where people can sit.  Yea.  It's confusing.  I heard great things from this one girl and have always been curious.  While milling around in the area around 10pm on a Thursday, I decided to check it out.  This is not a great place to go alone, even though everyone is drinking and there's a clubby vibe to it, it's not conducive to meeting new people since everyone's sitting at set tables and many people are speaking in Korean.  I sat in the corner and ordered some fried chicken wings.  I love chicken wings.  It was 8 pieces for $14, which is pretty expensive, at over $2 per wing after tax and tip.  Maybe it's just been a while since I've been to Bon Chon in NYC.  The Korean pop video made me feel super weird.  It featured a really pretty guy with tattoos who thinks of himself as really tough and \\"urban.\\"  I sat next to two guys speaking Korean and didn't want to interrupt them (it's weird table crashing people who might not speak English.  Plus, it's two guys).  So I saw the next table over looked liked interesting people.  A mix of white/Asian, guys/girls.  They all looked bored, on their phones, with tons of food and drinks untouched.  I asked if I could join them and long story short, it was a really fun night.  They got 25 bottles of soju for 5 people.  Insane.  The chicken wings I got were lackluster and definitely not worth $2/piece.  I probably won't really get food here, as it's overpriced and nothing special.  They bank on drunk people making poor decisions.  Which seemed to be the theme at my table as we struggled to finish the 25th bottle of soju and they drunk counted $20 bills to pay off the $500 or $600 that was owed.  Insane."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely terrible.

One of the restaurants on our list was Cowfish Sushi Burger, which is located over in the CityWalk area near Universal. We had seen some of the fun pictures of the burger and sushi combos, so we headed over one night to give it a try.\\n\\nWe arrived at the beautiful venue on a Tuesday night and were invited to take the elevator up to the second floor to get a table. On our way up, we noticed a fun \\"make a fish\\" game on the wall that kids seemed to like. We reached the second floor and the hostess took us over to sit on the heated patio. So far, so good.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, a server came over to introduce himself and give us menus. We looked over the menus for a few minutes and I decided to order the peanut butter cup alcoholic drink while my wife ordered a cocktail. The waiter then strongly (and a little oddly) pushed for us to order an appetizer. We weren't really feeling like one, so we just stuck with the drinks.\\n\\nAfter about 20 or so minutes, our drinks came out (not at the same time). My drink was fun and didn't have much alcohol (to be expected), but I don't think I'd order it again since the peanut butter cup pieces were mostly too big to go up the straw. My wife seemed to enjoy her cocktail. \\n\\nUnfortunately, while the atmosphere was nice and not terribly busy, we didn't see the server again for about another 20 minutes. We then finally got to put in our order, and he once again strongly urged us to get an appetizer (which we again rejected since we wanted to save room for dessert). I ordered The All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi and my wife ordered the \\"The Prime Time\\" Filet & Lobster Roll. While the prices on everything were standard theme-park level high, it would have been fine if that was our only issue.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the biggest issue here was the wait. It took about an hour for our food to finally get out to us. While I get longer wait times at a theme park, a 2 hour dinner experience with an hour of that being the wait for food (I'm guessing that's why the waiter pushed the appetizers so hard) on a Tuesday night makes me very disinclined to ever want to come back again just for sheer logistics. Furthermore, while my Cheeseburgooshi was good and my wife's Prime Time roll was decent, the small rolls and lack of much of a pop aside from just being unique aren't enough of a draw (especially combined with the wait and price) to give this place another shot. \\n\\nOverall, the Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar is an interesting concept restaurant at CityWalk with a nice venue, average wait staff and good food. Unfortunately, the crazy wait for small and expensive food that lacks pop beyond being unique makes this a place to avoid unless you come during a truly slow part of the day or just want a place that is all about the kids rather than the dining."},{"name":"Ninkazu Japanese Restaurant","address":"205-4231 Hazelbridge Way","city":"Richmond","stars":"2.5","text":"Went for AYCE lunch on October 25 with a group of friends.

I've dined-in and ordered to take-out, several different times.\\n\\nDining-in service is lack-luster and slow. Takes a long time to get your drink, then you wait a long time for your server to come back and take your order, then the food takes a really long time. When the food finally comes, something will be missing from your order, so you wait some more, usually, everyone else finishing their meals while you wait for yours, and no apology from the wait staff... just a shrug like 'You're out of luck. Oh well.'\\n\\nTake-Out isn't any better. They forget multiple items from our order, even though we paid for them. When you call management about the error, to make up for it (instead of refunding your credit card), they say there will be a gift-card at the front desk for you. When you go to use the gift card, they forgot to load it with any money. By that time, it's far too late to ask them to actually resolve.\\n\\nWith service like this, I'm surprised they are still in business."},{"name":"Dark Horse","address":"2922 Baseline Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Best wings, great burgers!!!!\\nGreat location, one of a kind experience!"},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I had the best burger ever here!

The menu has many options from classic breakfast to breakfast poutines, to eggs benny, waffles & french toast, and breakfast bowls. Five stars for my salmon laks (lox?) breakfast poutine which was half duck fat hashbrowns, half arugula base, with laks, soft poached eggs, cheese curds and hollandaise. \\n\\nThe *major* downside is the wait time - hence 4 stars. Today, on a Saturday, I put my name down on the Yelp waiting list at 10:00am from home. Estimated wait was 95-125 min, 77 tables ahead, as expected so I aimed to get there before noon and get seated around then. Check-in time was 11:37. I got there by 11:50 and it wasn't an issue. I didn't end up getting seated until 12:30 which was at a table sitting empty for at least 20 min - I knew because I was standing outside waiting and staring at the empty tables. At any given time there were multiple tables unoccupied, especially the bar style seats. \\n\\nAlthough the Yelp waiting list was useful (at the resto I heard ppl being completely denied with a 3-hour wait, since closing time was 3pm) the 10-min grace period to show up when the table is ready, unfortunately, makes the table turnaround very slow and inefficient. I hope they can figure out a way to use online booking and reduce wait times further. I didn't expect not to wait at all but 30-45 min on top of the estimate and the empty tables not being filled quickly left a bad impression.

I approached one of the servers and inquired where we go for the concert venue.  She replied that i needed to wait outside where a line forms.  I said is there somewhere we can wait inside and she was irritated that I was questioning further I guess and she said well, yeah and directed towards the dining room.  I was shocked at her disregard and felt that we, who were not familiar with the venue, were treated poorly.  The dining room was pretty empty (on a Friday night- not a good sign) so we took a table.  I will say the server came up immediately to ask if we wanted something to drink... later I spoke to a supervisor about the incident; he proceeded to inform all of us that he was in the area and he did not believe she was out of turn.

I read reviews and found out that people wait several hours just to get their BBQ.  Now, I don't like waiting for more than an hour for anything so wasn't sure if I'd be able to try this place.  I decided to try and hoped that the line wouldn't be too long.  When I got there, the line looked short but was told it was about an hour long.  There were maybe 10-12 people in line outside and heard when you get inside, it's still about 30 mins.  I was also told that there wasn't much meat left and couldn't guarantee anything from where I was in line.  Some people got out of line and left.  I decided to stay as I was an out-of-towner and wouldn't have many chances to try so I waited.  I think I waited maybe about 45-50 mins or so in total.  \\n\\n(I'm basing my review solely on the brisket as I didn't try anything else besides the BBQ beans).  They did run out of beef and pork ribs by the time I got to order.  The person in front of me ended up ordering like 3 lbs of brisket and couple lbs of other meat.  I was afraid the brisket would be out.  I ordered a brisket sandwich for $12.50 and there was a good amount of meat on it.  This brisket was so damn good!  It had a salt and pepper crust flavor and you can see a smoke ring on the meat.  It was so soft and had a good amount of fat that it just melted.  This was the softest and most flavorful brisket I've ever had and have had some dreams about it afterwards.  As good as the brisket is, I wouldn't wait in line for 3-4 hrs.  \\n\\nIt's hard for me to fathom why places that have such a high demand for their food and yet they don't expand their supply or even expand their hours for customers which in turn would increase revenue.  I would minus a star for this alone but the brisket was that good so no I won't.  Plus, the owner was very cool and gave us folks in line in the 92' heat some ice water while we anxiously waited and that was a nice gesture.  \\n\\nFranklin's BBQ brisket def lives up to the hype.

Two of my favorite things. Now, I know it doesn't sound conventional but I was up to explore! You can pick your side of the spectrum, go for a variety of 17 (yes, 17) burger options or pick one of the many sushi rolls, sashimi or makimono. BUT WHY HAVE JUST ONE?!?! Welcome the BENTO BOX! When you can't decide have both! They have the Cowfish Bento Box = combo with a mini burger, sweet potato fries, thai cucumber, 4 piece sushi roll & edamame. I went for the Fusion Specialty Bento Box which is the same as the above but you can have a specialty sushi roll. I went for the Firecracker roll - shrimp tempura with tempura flakes and delicate yellow tail salmon. The ponzu dipping sauce was a bit spicy but it blended the flavors so well you can't skip it and the flakes gave a great balance! Now one would think none of the above goes together but it was such an amazing meal! The mini burger was cooked well, juicy and just the right amount with all the other food in the box. I wasn't a fan of the thai cucumber, however my BF loved it ate his & mine. The edamame is salted and cooked well. The sweet potato fries are more of wedges & full of flavors! All in all it is a lot of food. But save room for dessert! They have amazing milkshakes! I went for a non-traditional shake The PB&J - SO GOOD!!

I then pointed out the empty seats and she said \\"we probably don't have enough seats to seat you\\". I asked again and she sighed and told us she'll seat us later.

The one positive I will say about Leo's Place is my french toast was simply beautiful, almost artistic, with berries arranged gorgeously inside and on top.  Beyond that though the most important thing, taste, was noticeably absent.  The french toast tasted like bread dipped in plain egg, there was no spice nor flavor.  It was supposedly made with challah bread which should have given it a sweet tastiness all it's own but it was simply bland.  It was \\"plated\\" (as was my daughter's chocolate french toast) with a light sprinkle of powdered sugar and a large sprinkle of plain unsweetened cocoa powder on the plate and over the food which made it taste bitter and unappetizing.  Additionally when I asked for ice for our water (they had given it room temperature) the waiter took our glasses and then brought back the same ones along with another filled with ice for us to apparently put into our cups ourselves.  When I mentioned that my daughter's glass was leaving brown rings on the table (that looked like soda or coffee), the person (possibly the owner) misunderstood and then dismissively blamed us saying we came in and sat down  not giving them time to clean (there were no more than 2 tables with a couple patrons at them the whole time we were there).  When I clarified that the table had actually been cleaned before we sat and it was the glass doing this, he grumpily said something to the waiter, who then brought her another glass.  When my mother asked if he had met all the people (actors, etc) pictured on the walls and he said straight faced he grew up with them.  It seemed to me as if he was being rude and condescending to a friendly old woman. We intermittently kept getting strong whiffs of cigarette smoke which also made the dining experience unpleasant, made me wonder if they were smoking in the back and caused us to end our breakfast with my parents sooner than we would have otherwise.

Eventually I spotted a pot of some runny liquid, can I have one of those, it won't go with your salad, well I'll risk it because it couldn't be any worse we both thought.

And that is right an opinion on social media.  But here we are.  We love their menu and their food, but routinely (at least at the Winter Garden location) find that the online ordering execution is severely broken.  Constantly have problems with items not being available once the driver gets to the store, even though the app allows them.  Tonight, we order Vietnamese Spring Rolls for delivery, our driver calls us from the store telling us they're out and hands us over to a Pei Wei associate.  We are asked if we can get a substitution and are ultimately told that this can't happen because the additional $2 payment can't be taken over the phone.  The only option is an item refund, even though the rest of our order is complete and ultimately on the way.  So one family member will go without food!!\\n\\nWe call the manager back (\\"Lee\\") and are told that this is their policy.  But - he will waive the $2 but we have to come to the store to pick up the substituted item.  I ask them to deliver it like the rest of our food (kind of defeats the purpose to waive $2 when I have to spend $5 or more in gas just to drive up there and back, doesn't it??).  He says they can't, again due to \\"policy\\".  So I ask for the corporate number and I guess will resolve on Monday.\\n\\nSo sad as we so love their food, but this is at least the 5th time in a year and I just don't know that we can risk it any more.

We ordered A LOT of food - 2lbs brisket, 1lb ribs, 1/2lb pulled pork, 1/4lb turkey, and 2 sausage links as well as a quart of potato salad and a single side of slaw. Let's start with the meat. 1. The brisket - incredible flavor. By far the most tender brisket I have ever had. 2. The ribs - again, incredible flavor. The meat just falls right off. 3. Pulled pork - we got the \\"special sauce\\" which seemed vinegar-ish and threw off the flavor of the pork itself in my opinion. Not the best pulled pork I've had but still good. 4. The turkey - no turkey is ever good unless smothered in gravy and mashed potatoes at thanksgiving. If you're the first 10 or so people in line the turkey would probably be good because it's fresh but after sitting in the warming box it just dries up. Not worth it. 5. Sausage - good flavor, not spicy, good smoke flavor, very juicy. Definitely worth a try. Now to the sides. 1. Potato salad - mustard, so much mustard. If you like your potatoes covered in mustard, you'll love this salad. If not, steer clear. 2. Slaw - very flavorful. Very crunchy. \\nAll in all our experience at Franklin's was incredible. We have A LOT of leftovers and are enjoying every second of them.

Ham, olives, artichoke, mushrooms, and mozzarella.

Waited until 11AM to get my food. Aaron Franklin is there to greet you at the counter to say hi. I joked around with him a bit and wasn't sure if I might have offended him by jokingly calling him out for cutting in line. You also get some samples in line as they cut for you. \\n\\nAs for the food... totally worth the wait, price premium, and even the whole plane ticket to ATX. The flavor of the smoke is so prominent in all of the meats. You can also tell how much they love their pepper in Austin because all of the meat had a strong taste of pepper, especially the ribs. Brisket is about the best you can ever get and it was definitely the best smoked brisket I have ever had. The fatty pieces just fall apart in your hands and melt away in your mouth. \\n\\nRibs were also melt in your mouth delicious. Smokey, peppery, a bit sweet, and the bones just slip out from under the meat. \\n\\nTurkey was a bit dry. It was still good, but wasn't the best preparation I've ever had. Not sure if it was brined, but it probably should be since it keeps it moist and flavorful. \\n\\nPulled pork... I can't say enough about this pulled pork. You stand at the counter, watch as someone pulls out a whole pork shoulder, watch as the shoulder bone accidentally falls out because the meat is so tender, and then digs his fingers into the meat pulling it apart, grabbing a heap of it, tossing it onto a roll, and then drizzling it with sauce. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, or hunger, but there is a beauty and magic to it that can't be described. You'd have to witness it first hand. \\n\\nThe SAUSAGE really surprised me. My friends were underwhelmed and said it \\"lacked flavor\\". I thought differently. I think they were expecting a really salty smoked sausage. It was a bit definitely smokey, sweet, porky, fantastic thick crunch, and the inside was really specially moist, juicy, and tender. It almost seemed like it was undercooked, but I was convinced that they prepared it this way. Different than any other sausage I've ever had. A+\\n\\nThe Banana Bourbon pie was a nice finisher to the amazing meal.\\n\\nAfter all the tasting is done, I feel like something should be said about the whole experience of it. You spend half the day waiting in line to eat this food. You chat with the people in line, share beers with them, and play some games if you're prepared. The meat is wrapped up all together in butcher paper with pickles and onions. The flavors and juices mix together. You take to a table, or to a park, or home, to unwrap it and eat it picnic style. It's like a family and friend gathering, unique to Franklin BBQ. I'm not saying that other places don't do this. There probably are a lot, but they probably don't have the same quality of food."},{"name":"Jim Adams Farm & Table","address":"2011 Bolton Rd NW, Ste 109","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First time at Jim Adams and I was not sure what to expect but let's just say I was pleasantly surprised!

They tasted good but nothing special that I couldn't have gotten at another good wing place. The brisket was a disappointment. I only got a single, somewhat dry slice of brisket. For being \\"fatty\\", it wasn't very fatty, actually rather sort of dry. I couldn't cut it with a fork, I had to cut it with a knife, so it wasn't very tender. Not great flavor or crust either, I had to dip it in sauce which I never do with good brisket. The collards were a little too sweet and tangy, it's like they put their bbq sauce in the greens, and I prefer my greens to be smoky and salty. The brussel sprouts were fine, if you don't like blue cheese crumbles, ask for them to not put it on, seems like a weird thing to put on brussel sprouts.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was fine but unimpressive.

Nope, never stopped to refill waters either. When the food came, my burger was good but cold so had probably been sitting out. When we told the waiter our problems he assured us the manager would be right over. The manager came by about 5 mins later and breezes through our issues saying they were slammed and that was it. Well, it didn't seem super busy, we have def been in other times when it's been busier. Also, you are at Citywalk, you should be use to having lots of people eating. My burger should've been warm and my fries shouldn't have been cold. For the money we spend, we probably won't be back for awhile. Next time, it will be Vivo that gets our business and money.

You must give them an estimate of about how much meat you are planning to order while you're waiting in line, so they know where to cut off the line and say this is the point where we're going to sell out.\\n2.

A paragraph on its \\"7th Trimester\\" breakfast sandwich and \\"Grilled Pimento Cheese w/ Bacon\\" lunch (aka \\"normal\\") sandwich often find their way into local articles otherwise committed to higher-end spots, as if to prove the author's knowledge of a culinary life outside Winter Park or I-Drive. If you're of a specific breed of Yelper it's impossible to consider a trip to Orlando without a minimum of one brunch stop to visit Chef Trina's community staple.\\n\\nWhen a new location for Se7en Bites was announced it was hard to picture what would change - transitioning from a cramped and crowded space to one of the largest (if not the largest) independent bakeshop in Orlando gave some pause, but any hesitation melts away as you pull into the parking lot where vibrant street art adorns the outside of the restaurant as well as the wall flanking the lot. When you walk in it feels less like a city than like a small-town southern comfort spot, framed with metal ceiling and wood walls, dominated by its open space and bustling atmosphere, letterpress artwork adorning the walls with phrases like \\"be nice or leave\\" and \\"bacon is always better.\\"\\n\\nLike any brunch location worth its salt, Se7en Bites has a simple, straightforward menu with little to no learning curve. The line moves relatively quickly, so if you're a choosy person it's best to check the menu before you get in.

If you are a sweet-tooth person, this is definitely the spot for you.  There is a candy store attached to the restaurant that has a wide variety of candies and chocolates, as well as ice cream, gelato, milk shakes and cookies. The restaurant section is not very big.  It reminds me of a burger joint the way it is set up.  I think they could have done more with the d√©cor and spruced it up a bit.\\n\\nI had reservations, so I did not have to wait long for a table.  When we were seated, the chair had some crumbs on it. I sat on the lounge part and sank into a deep hole as the cushion was not padded on that particular spot.

If you can drink one of these by your lonesome, you are a champ.  The drinks are actually four drinks in one.  They are so visually appealing.  I ordered the salmon salad, which I was a bit disappointed.  I absolutely love salmon and I was not impressed with this dish.  The salmon portion was small and not that tasty.

We had ribs, coleslaw, potato salad, and sweet tea. These ribs were just about fall-off-the-bone tender! They were really large, meaty, and juicy. These are wet style ribs with sauce, and although I'm a dry rub ribs fan, these were absolutely fantastic. I'd put these in the top 3 ribs I've ever had, and my coworker said easily #1. If it weren't for the sides and the requisite white wonder bread, I could've easily eaten a full rack. We were there on a Thursday night and it was full but not crowded, and there was live music inside which added to the rib shack atmosphere. I'll be back if the chance arises when I'm in ATL.

Another 15-20 minutes go by before our food is brought out. When I say something the waiter is rude and acts like I've done something wrong in pointing out how long we've been waiting. He is defensive and claims he is the manager when we asked for someone in charge. The food was mediocre at best. \\n\\nI don't mind waiting for my food if there is a delay but there needs to be communication from the waiter about it instead of ignoring us for an hour and then being nasty to us.

I'd been to other Brazilian churrascaria houses before and wanted to try this one.  \\n\\nThere wasn't a whole lot special about it.  We visited the salad bar first.  It was fairly sparse, but a few good items on there.  The tomatoes were fresh, the greek-style salad was tasty.  The caprese salad was decent.   \\nThe tomato bisque soup was not warm enough, same with the mashed potatoes.  They had some more upscale items - artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, asparagus, smoked salmon - but I don't care much for those foods so I passed them up.  \\n\\nWe all know why you go to the rodizio - THE MEATS!   Once we got the meats flowin', they came to the table at a rapid pace.     There was a wide range of meats - some were delicious, others - not so much.  \\n\\nOne of my favorites was the picanha (house special) sirloin.  It was flavorful and tender. We got several servings of this one.  I also really enjoyed the parmesan pork - juicy and tasty.  The flank steak was good... thick cuts with a texture like pot roast.  The pork ribs were done with a dry sauce. They were flavorful. The bacon-wrapped chicken breast was decent.\\n\\nThe meats I did NOT care for:  Garlic beef was TOO garlicky, too well-done, too fatty.  The bacon-wrapped filet mignon was disappointing.  It had a funny taste to it that we couldn't quite place... as if the bacon overwhelmed the flavor of the steak.   The sausages were very dry and WAY too salty.   I'm not a big fan of lamb, but I tried it anyway - and didn't care for it much.  The top sirloin was described as medium-rare by the gaucho who brought it to our table... but it was VERY rare and bloody in the center.  I ate only the outer areas.  \\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't say it was a bad experience, but it wasn't great or memorable either.   I probably wouldn't go back... definitely not at full price.  I left feeling like I COULD have eaten more, but didn't want to... and that's not really how you should leave a Brazilian Steakhouse that you're paying close to $40 per person for.

But after discovering Franklin Barbecue on the show Food Paradise, and with very little to do in Austin, I decided to Black Friday myself during my final hours of my stay here.\\n\\nFranklin wasn't hard to find.  I arrived at 7:15ish, parked in their lot with no issues.  Grabbed myself a provided camping chair, and waited in line as the fourteenth customer.  While waiting and yelping, some of the staff were nice enough to point out, the restrooms being open, a coffee truck nearby, and they're selling beer while waiting in line.  $4 for my local Live Oak HefeWeizen.  I know, a bit expensive, but a refreshing breakfast.  \\n\\nThey were open a bit early for customers that have pre-ordered, then let everyone else in at 11am.  Once at the entrance, you walk in with excitement and inhale the smokiness.  The dining area was fairly small;  Wooden tables that provides paper towels, condiments, and Franklin Barbecue sauce provided.\\n\\nHere's my little order:  \\n~ Pork Ribs ($17/lb, 2 lbs) 4/5 stars, tender, fall off the bone, excellent herby rub, smoky aroma, smoke ring, damn what else did I forget?  These were some good arse ribs!  WORTH IT!\\n~ Turkey ($17/lb, 1 lbs) 3.5/5, moist with a nice peppery outside.  It did start to dryout a bit, but still had some good brine juicy flavor.  Not overly salty either.  Worth a try!\\n~ Sausage ($12/lb, 2 lbs) 3.5/5, hmm hard to remember these as the brisket and pulled pork sandwich taste over shadowed these links.  They were peppery but not as good as The Salt Lick sausage, imo.  Worth a try, if in the mood.\\n~ Pulled Pork Sandwich ($8.50) 5/5, now this I was NOT planning on getting.  UNTIL the guy before me ordered one.  My eyes EXPLODED with lust!  For only $8.50, they stacked it on good!  Biggest pile-up of pulled pork on a burger bun.  Slap on the slaw on top! Greasy soft top bun.  Only regret, not taking a picture.  A messy sandwich of desire!  MUST GET, if available!\\n~ Brisket ($20/lb, 3 lbs) 5/5, LOVED IT!  While nearing next in line, the slicer guy cut up some burnt-end samples.  And maaan, that really got all my senses excited!  I asked for moist and fatty slices.  Got my meat weighed.  Sat down with new friends I met in line, shared opinions, climaxed on meat!  As this was by far THEE BEST BRISKET I've ever had!  It's just tender all around.  The rub was perfect.  The smokiness just plastered onto my face and clothes.  And when I had a sample of my $177 order, I had a peaceful moment \\"like eating a filet mignon with that perfect red wine for the first time.\\"  Yep, you can quote me on that one!  TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!!!\\n\\nOther goodies:\\n~ Bourbon Banana Pie ($8) 4/5, damn now this had a sweet and crunchy graham cracker bottom.  The custard had real banana slices, and still had hints of bourbon with every bite.  So good!\\n~ 3 fo $10, bottles of Franklin Barbecue sauce!  Original Texas Style, Expresso, and Sweet Vinegar.  They're meats can do without sauce, but they're doable.  \\n~ Two t-shirts, $17 each.  They even had it's own mesquite smoke fabric softener smell to it as well.  Hats, baby-wear, and much more.\\n\\nNow, I gotta say, that the wait for Franklin's was totally totally worth the wait for it!  Now that they've got it down, they should think of expanding!  Make room like The Salt Lick.  But off the subject... When I first had lasik done, I thought that was clearly the best investment I've ever made!  Second best investment ever was 'waiting for Franklin's brisket'!  Third is the Forever Lazy... OK ok, nuff said!

Franklin Barbecue is perhaps the most famous Texas BBQ spot and rightly so.  \\n\\nHere's what I learned/tips\\n\\n1) If you think you are getting there somewhat early, that's not early enough. Most people start lining up at 6am-7am. Highly recommend coming super early on a hot day so you can avoid the sun. Or if you enjoy a slight suntan, tan away. \\n2) Depend on the day, the wait is anywhere between 3-6 hours so mean as well enjoy it. I had a blast hanging out with people on the line. Met people from Austin, Portland and Miami.  Drink some beer, relax and enjoy each other's company. CVS is a block away and sells alcohol. Woohoo. Share some with friends. \\n3)The food that really stood out to me was the brisket and the ribs. So I can recommend ordering  a lot. If you order too much, It's still going to be good BBQ when you get hungry later. Food is delicious. I encourage people to try all of the food on the menu.\\n\\nIf you are new to BBQ, I recommend watching BBQ with Franklin. Youtube it, Google it, and etc. Greater appreciation of Texas BBQ."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Juicy and moist......fried chicken!

I was pleasantly surprised I was able to get a 6:30 time slot for 3 the day of. It was a Wednesday, but still, this is often a pretty busy spot. \\n\\nIt's a little hard to find at first because it's in the lower level of the Brattle Theater building. You feel a bit like you're entering one of the Cambridge/Somerville area's speakeasy-style spots, but as you walk past the bar it opens up into a shockingly spacious and airy restaurant. There's a decent number of bar seats as well, so I'd definitely come back for a drink on another visit. \\n\\nWe began with a round of drinks: one glass of red wine, an Over the Moon (rye based, served straight up with a cherry) and a Silver & Gold (tequila and golden beat) which were all awesome. We all liked K's wine enough (a lip smacking Cote du Rhone) that C and I both ordered a glass to eat with our meal. Water (still or sparkling) is refilled frequently. \\n\\nA&H is a large-format tapas place so you're meant to order a number of dishes to share. They recommend about 2 per person as opposed to the usual 3 or 4 at traditional tapas places.\\n\\nK, C and I are all big foodies without any dietary restrictions so it was easy to find a number of dishes we were all interested in. I wouldn't come here with a pickier eater. Also, while there's lots of delicious veggie options, you're probably better only to come with a vegetarian/vegan if there's a large group so you can still try the meat-based menu items. \\n\\nThey started us off with a small complimentary dish of sesame-topped, pickled green beans. They have a number of jars of pickled veggies around the restaurant so I'm guessing the type rotates occasionally. They were a crisp and refreshing way to start out a hearty meal. We also got an order of the sourdough and house butter which, while tasty, was probably not worth the $8 price tag. I'd put that towards a more unique menu item next time. \\n\\nFor the main meal we split the root veggie latkes, fried brussel sprouts, braised rabbit, strozzapretti (a sort of Italian dumpling). By far the winners for me were the latkes and strozzapretti, I would definitely order both again. I brussels were excellent too, but it's hard to mess up a fried brussel sprout. I didn't adore the rabbit as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely still tasty. \\n\\nWe were also given a complimentary order of the mackeral which was served over a lovely bed of a savory slaw with a slightly sweet twist. C and K loved it, and I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it as well. It was a little fishy for me (I'm very picky about fish, so that's a comment on my personal preferences, not their preparation) but perfectly cooked and seasoned. \\n\\nI'm not sure why we were given the extra dish, possibly they do that if you cross a certain threshold of price, maybe the kitchen made it by mistake and they had to give it to someone. I had made a reservation through OpenTable, so maybe they connected that to my Yelp profile and treated us knowing that I'd be writing a review. Whatever the reason, definitely a nice extra touch and one that meant that we all left with very full bellies. Perhaps overly full.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and attentive throughout the evening, and happy to patiently answer all of our questions and describe multiple drinks and dishes to us. For a super filling meal and two rounds of drinks, we each paid around $60 including tax and tip. Definitely a splurge, but not a stupid amount of money.

Then the check comes, and there's a 90 cent charge for the sour cream and a 90 cent charge for the guacamole for each of us. Blake B told us nothing about this and when we complained, his response was that he asked if we wanted to \\"add\\" a side of guac and sour cream, so we should've known. First of all, he didn't use the word \\"add,\\" and second of all, even if he did, he should've been clearer.\\n\\nSo the food is good but avoid Blake B if you can and know they charge almost a dollar for sour cream and guac.

Trying to put the condiments on the sandwich at the topping bar may result in dropping the sandwich top or spilled toppings. The plastic trays that Disney serves the food on are not that clean so I do not want to eat food that touched the tray.

You have to stand in line to get a plate. Waiting area seating is very limited and most people are while standing. Pre-show started around 8pm and it was mainly to organize the crowds.

I regularly hold parties and meetings at Tonys because of the ample parking, downtown location, intimate setting and great value. The food is extremely fulfilling and a delight to the senses. One thing I particularly appreciate is the ambiance. The soft lighting and Italianate design details whisk you away from the everyday hustle and bustle. The service rivals that of most 5-star restaurants I have been to abroad and in most instances, exceeds my lofty expectations.

At 550am we were the first in line. The people behind us got there 2 minutes later and the next group was there less than 10 minutes after that. So was the line worth it? Absolutely!\\nFirst off, if you're coming in from a locale where good barbecue does not exist (basically anywhere outside of Texas), you owe it to your stomach to stuff as much brisket, ribs, and pulled pork into it as humanly possible. Second, Aaron Franklin=James Beard Award winner. Clearly this place knows what they're doing with meat. Third, the line is a part of the experience of eating at Franklin. Would I prefer that the brisket is delivered straight to my mouth as soon as it comes out of the smoker? Yes, but waiting in line builds your excitement and you get to meet and talk with incredibly friendly people that are as excited to eat as you are.\\nTips for the line: \\n-BRING SUNBLOCK! Unless you are 100% certain that it's going to be cloudy day, you'll need it at some point.\\n-Bring something to do or bring a portable charger for your phone if your \\"something to do\\" is your phone.\\n-Make friends with your neighbors in line. Take a break from your phone, be friendly, and strike up a conversation with the people around you- this IS Texas after all!\\nAs for the food: \\nWe're no novices when it comes to Texas BBQ- my husband grew up in TX and we make several trips a year just for to get our fix of barbecue and TexMex. In the Austin/Lockhart area we've covered all the essentials several times over: La Barbecue, Smitty's, Kreuz, The Original Black's, Salt Lick, Micklethwait, and Terry Black's. While most have been pretty good Franklin makes the BEST brisket I've ever had and it's easily one of the top 10 things I've eaten in my life. \\nWe also ordered the smoked turkey, pork ribs, sausage, and pulled pork in addition to the potato salad and beans (you gotta make that 5 hour wait worth your while). The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and juicy, the turkey was surprisingly flavorful (I probably wouldn't have ordered if it wasn't suggested but I'm glad I did), the pulled pork was moist and made for good sandwiches several hours later, and the sausage wasn't bad (not a fan of sausage in general). While I have favorite places for each of these items it was definitely worth it to try them here as the quality of everything was excellent. \\nTo give you an idea for how much to order for 2 people, we ordered 2lbs of brisket (both lean and fatty cuts), 1 lb of ribs (not a lot considering that the bone weighs quite a bit), a few slices of turkey, 1/4 lb of pulled pork, 1 sausage link, 1/2 lb of potato salad, and a small amount of beans. We were\\nstarving by the time we ordered and killed quite a bit of the food but had enough leftovers for 2 meals and several snacks. I highly suggest ordering a bit of everything."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Note: I only give 5* ratings to truly exceptional, best-in-class establishments. \\n\\nFirst, I must apologize, but I am just now finishing my review from quite a while ago.  \\n\\nBiscuits & Corn Bread: Good, but the corn bread is better.  Nice small size to each bread, and the flavor is good.  There are bits of corn in the corn bread, which is a nice textural choice.  The biscuits were slightly on the dry side, but that's what the butter is for (I would prefer them with a smear of jam or honey).  But the corn bread is on point.\\nShe-crab soup: A bit salty with a hint of spiciness.  Well worth the price and it's an excellent choice from the menu.\\nMaryland crab cake: Truly no fillers, made of lump crab with good-sized pieces of tasty, juicy crab.

It was super packed but we had a reservation. The server was pushey about ordering. We chose the spinach dip to start. When we got it, there were four small pieces of bread for a dinner plate portion of dip. We asked for more and the server (Tyler) said that all he could come up with was an additional few pieces but he would not charge.\\n\\nWe had looked at the menu for awhile and then the server notes everything with a star they are out of. We thought the star denoted a specialty item. So we picked something else. My best friend chose to order the mojito but when it came out there was no mint. We asked Tyler and he said \\"he did not see any on that side of the bar\\" and they were out of the gummies for the drink. When our friend asked if they had soda, which we saw on the way out, the server said no.\\n\\nWe ordered and when we got our entree my husband asked for yellow mustard for his sandwich.

I came in skeptical that a burger sushi place in Florida could be good, but left full and satisfied. \\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\nHokkaido Nights ($10.50) - Everyone kept sipping from mine! It's an ideal balance of fruity and not too sweet. Best way to describe it... like an Orange Mojito with some fresh basil and lemongrass syrup mixed in 44 North Nectarine Vodka. If you want a little fruity, not too sweet and very refreshing, order one of these, I loved mine! \\n\\nBuffalos and Bacon ($11) - Candied Bacon Old Fashioned! A very crisp piece of bacon, sugar cured and place on toothpick a top a Buffalo Trace Bourbon Old Fashiioned (w/ cherry liqueur, orange bitters, angostura bitters, honey, Luxardo cherry). Highly recommended.\\n\\nMoscow Mule ($11) - Good, they use Russian Standard Vodka.\\n\\nRuby Panther (Vodka, Simple Syrup, Lime Juice, Pink Lemonade, Raspberries, $9.50)\\n - I had a taste of this, it was on the sweet and fruity side. \\n\\nDishes - \\n\\nCrab Rangoon Dip (Crab Rangoon w/ Panko Crust, served with Fried Wonton Skins, $12) - I wish the there was a little more dip but us seafood lovers gobbled this up. If you come in expecting a crab dip with baked on crunchy Panko crust on top, you won't be disappointed. If you're expecting a reinvention of the wheel... Well, it's not that. \\n\\nParmesan Bacon Truffle Fries ($8) - If you aren't getting these to go with your burger, you can place a separate full order of this. Melted truffle and parmesan cheese with Applewood bacon bits and chives. You can easily split this between four people and it'll be gone. \\n\\nThe King's Roll (Tuna, Kani, Jalapeno, Cream Cheese, Scallions... flash fried in Panko Crust and topped w/ Kani Salad, Sirarcha, Masago, Japanese Mayo, $17) - A traditional sushi chef would cringe at this everything behemoth roll, but if you just have to have fried sushi, this is as good as any. Hard to pick out the tuna quality when everything is mashed together like this, but I liked it. You could eat it all yourself, but probably better if you split between 2-4 people so that you can eat some other things. \\n\\nBlack Truffle Cheese Burger (Black Truffle Cheese, Roasted Shallots, Mushrooms, Lettuce, Garlic Aioli, Brioche Bun, $15) - The burger did not look that impressive when plated but tasted great.  They use 1/2 lb. patties. For an extra $.50 you can sub out your regular fries for either sweet potato or parmesan bacon truffle fries. \\n\\nThe servers here were good and the restaurant was able to fit our party of 12 in no problem on a Saturday afternoon around 2 p.m. The restaurant was about half full when we were there and they even have an upstairs area that wasn't being used. \\n\\nCowfish is a unique concept and they pull it off well. They have friendly sushi rolls that even those that don't love sushi would venture a bite. Primetime Filet and Lobster Roll? Pulled Pork Roll? Yup. You can order burgers like the Jalapeno Popper, Boursin Bacon, Beef and Short Rib and have appetizers like Fried Pickles and Blackened Tuna Nachos.

My fried tried a blueberry dark ale, which was much more interesting. \\n\\nComing to the food, they've a small-ish menu, but the items are such that your would want to try most. We started with the beef tartare and bigger marrow. The bone marrow was lick-the-last-morsel-off good. And you get a fair portion of the marrow as well. Beef tartare - good, but not game changing. My main motivation this time was to try their burger. Let me make it clear right up front, the burger goes way past my baseline expectations. There combination of the melted brie and perfectly medium rare patty is fantastic. What didn't quite work for me, is the thick cut bacon. As bacon devotee myself, I found the thick cut a little more chewy than I'd prefer. But that's very, very subjective do don't get too swayed by that. We got a side of frites to share and they kicked ass. Thin cut, crispy, fresh and the accompanying Sriracha mayo is da bomb! Have tried their mussles on a previous visit.

There was spice, heat, curry, rice, veggies, and BOLD delicious flavor. My fiance added steak atop his for an extra $10 making the plate $27 in total. The steak was cooked well, and it was a very filling portion. If anyone is curious, this dish does REHEAT in the microwave well, without changing the flavor.\\n\\nMushroom Tofu Burger: Again, I was impressed with this burger. I have eaten LOTS of burgers in life, but this by far has been the best of the NON meat variety.  I am not a fan of the texture of this burger, but it was a new thing to me all together.

Amazing rotisserie chicken - I ordered a half bird to split with my husband and got Romesco sauce (not overly spicy and I'm sensitive) and sopa de ajo (chicken broth and should not be considered a sauce, skip it) the green goddess is the best so I would recommend ordering it. We also ordered the rotisserie cauliflower which was the standout! The green goddess dressing that comes on it was AMAZING - we ended up dipping our chicken in this. Radicchio salad is good, but I'm not a huge fan of cheese so if you like cheese order it - very light and refreshing. It's communal dining so find a table anywhere and bus your own table. Soda is only sold in cans but they will give you a cup of ice.

You may either choose to do the outdoor order/pickup service with outdoor seating or dine in the inside area. I chose to dine in and I found the service to be sufficient for a fast casual restaurant.\\n\\nAs for the taste test? The food here is decent. I ordered the Big Tasty burger, Chicky Chicky Parm Parm sandwich, Plain Dog, and 50/50 Fries & Rings. The burger and hotdog were okay but I'd say that they were nothing memorable. The Chicky Chicky Parm Parm had a good amount of tomato sauce and cheese, and the chicken was hot. However, about 20% of the chicken contained tendon and I found it difficult to chew on. The fries were hot, crispy, and delicious. The onion rings were good; they had a nice crunch from the thinness of the onion rings. However, they soaked up too much oil so if you easily get nauseous after eating greasy food, I'd say skip the onion rings."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak At Turner Field","address":"755 Hank Aaron Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Last season, I was slightly disappointed with KR Steak.  However, it is nice to see what can happen over a season of revamping and learning lessons.  \\n\\nI have been back twice, to get the \\"Kevin\\" (the monstrous double) and I tell you what- I would have to say it is the best ballpark sandwich I have ever had, anywhere.  I live in search of great ballpark food and I have traveled far on my journeys.  I have seen the simple, to the extravagant, and this year- I think the \\"Kevin\\" gets the grand slam.\\n\\nOn Saturday. (which was also the day of the Steve Miller Concert)- Turner Field was pretty damn crowded.  It was nice to see it crowded, but this meant one thing- long lines and a lot of rookies.  My buddy and I went to the 755 to grab a brew, and went to go searching for food. \\n\\nWell, hell, we both knew what we wanted- a KR sandwich.  When we got there, the place was a ghost town.  It was only the 5th inning, wth happened?  We went up, and asked, they cheerfully told us they were open!\\n\\nSo after a 400 mile road trip, without thinking twice, I told them I wanted the double.  They looked at me in disbelief, I just told them to trust me on this one.  So cut after cut of that juicy steak, the scale kept getting heavier as they weighed the juicy goodness.  \\n\\nA double is a large sandwich, indeed- enough for 2-3 people.  Thankfully they cut it in half for you.  It comes with a heaping order of chips, and 2 things of horseradish sauce.  Honestly, it doesn't even need the sauce.\\n\\nThe burger itself is on almost a brioche style bun, and the seasoning it comes with is amazing.  The meat just tastes better than it did last year- top notch.  My mouth is watering for one as we speak.\\n\\nThe only downside is, the price.  It is a freakin $28 sandwich.  Thankfully, I have never had to pay that.  With STH privileges, the 33% off food can be applied, and also if you have added value to your ticket, that can be applied.  So I usually spend just under $9 on the sandwich.  I think that helps the case in being the best ballpark sandwich in America.\\n\\nI cannot wait to go back, might have to get TWO Kevins next time..."},{"name":"Wingstop","address":"4920 Flat Shoals Pkwy, Ste 102","city":"Decatur","stars":"2","text":"I am a regular customer and come  here weekly on the weekends because I genuinely love Wingstop!

The menu is more extensive, albeit not any cheaper. The food quality is more restaurant than bar, which is enough to convince me to \\"trek\\" to Fenway. The cocktails are my style aka lemon soju cocktail tastes solely of lemonade. They also have a variety of Korean and American beer. The outdoor patio basically seals the deal and makes this non-bar person a fan of Sojuba. \\n\\nThe one missing star is the music. I'm squarely in the korean music camp. I've been here a couple times and the music is more American on weekend nights, so for Korean music, basically have to go pre-8pm. Which is probably for the better of my wallet; otherwise, I'd be here every weekend. \\n\\nFor food, I've had the budae jungol (army stew for two) - really beats out any other army stew I've had at a bar. There's tons of tofu, spam, ramen, all the delicious things. I'm willing to have this spicy pot in the summer. \\nThe stir-fried spicy squid is a perfect bar dish with chewy squid and thin wheat noodles to mix in. This place also has my favorite pajeon/scallion pancake, super crispy not too chewy. I haven't really like soondae/blood sausage before, but the soondae makes their soondae bokum a go to order. The ttobokki is decently spicy but not overwhelming, would love to get the ramyun ttobokki next time. \\n\\nThe service is generally nice and friendly. They get a little overwhelmed as a new bar with a lot of real estate to cover and therefore potential for some things to slip through the cracks, but I think I've seen the owner will step in a take an order as needed, which is great to see.

Most nights I go there is some type of local band, be it college/high school students, or maybe some more middle aged folks who like to get together and play.

Though it didn't look particularly appetizing when they brought it out, it was actually very good--especially considering that the yucca fries it came with were underwhelming. I did find one bone, but I was able to catch it.\\n\\nHowever, the main issue came with everything else in this restaurant. First, our waiter was super friendly and charming, but was clearly new and did not know when to come and take our order, clear our plates, or get the bill--and we were literally the only people there most of the night. In addition, my mother said that she went into the bathroom at one point and caught one of the staff--who happened to be the manager--smoking in there. That's pretty gross if you ask me--and would signal why this place was empty.\\n\\nOverall, the food here has always been good in my opinion, but the staff just lacks a general etiquette and knowledge of how to run a restaurant.

The steak was so perfect I no longer want to open my own restaurant do to that one being so good I would never be able to make such a thing. Steak was actually cooked exactly how I wanted it and every single person that worked there came to check if it was cooked properly. The owner lui also came to talk to us and serve our beer need he made us feel cared for like family. Highly highly recommend it.

Gumbo was good and packed with veggies, rice, and some sausage. The jambalaya was not bad. I expected the dish to be more saucy (?). This may sound weird, but fish that comes in the dish was pretty darn delicious. My boyfriend got the fried chicken. This dish, I highly recommend. It was super crispy on the outside and juicy and flavorful in the inside. Eat a piece of that with some mashed potatoes, HEAVEN. My friends got the brisket and the screen door plate. Brisket was really good. Had a nice smokey flavor. If you can't decide what to eat, the screen door plate may be a good option for you because you have choose up to 3 house sides and/or their local organic vegetable dish. \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed my dinner here.

Just don't be expecting it to taste exactly like an authentic bacon-based BLT.  The bacon substitute isn't quite as chewy and salty/smoky, but it was a solid vegan rendition of an American classic.

The charred broccoli was good and that was about it. And there was no toast to go with this. $14 LOL\\n\\nGREEN SHAKSHUKA- my friend go this and I didn't get a chance to try it. I've had Shakshuka before and it's delicious. This was green Shakshuka and I have no idea what that is but it looked just as sad as my red Quinoa plate. It did not come in a griddle they usually do. It was a small plate with an attractive blob of what looked like scrambled eggs with mixed in. At least this dish came with toast.\\n\\nSHISHITO PIZZA- this was actual pretty good. Mostly because you can't mess up pizza. They do have an actual pizza oven in the kitchen.  Shishito is apparently some kind of green pepper. Had shishito, potato slices and prosciutto. \\n\\nPOTATOS (side) - probably my favorite thing we ordered. Literally just a side of potato's with some aoili sauce. It's small round potato's but they make it really crispy on the outside.  \\n\\nMaybe their other stuff is good. But if you try this place out, ask the waitress what everything is before you order anything. Don't assume things like I did because it was definitely NOT worth paying what we paid for the food we got."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Screen Door is a very \\"gets the job done\\" type of establishment.

First time we dug into the garden and Caesar salads, mine with their scrumptious vinaigrette dressing laden with basil (only rivaled by Buca's), followed by the second best fried calamari I've ever eaten and, next, chickens piccata and marsala not to be surpassed - anywhere.  Next lunch we again had the aforementioned salads plus appetizer, then ordered their spaghetti with meatball special.  The portions were huge and freshly made, the rich marinara, as always, delicious.  The garlic rolls were unequaled locally - baked golden with a goodly dose of fresh grated parmigiana or romano and that perfect drizzle of fine olive oil.  I still had room for some tiramisu which, though not made by them, was perfecta.  Not surprisingly, we took home a second meal.  Our last lunch was a little less satisfying, as portions were noticeably smaller and the garlic sticks near-to-unbaked, which we took home to finish.  This time the sole deviation was my ordering the manicotti, which was way too cheesy rendering the pasta beneath a tad too limp.  We order at least once a month from LeMay's, generally a few subs, a deluxe pizza and a small calzone.  The subs remain excellent, the calzone is great, but the too salty pizza has become almost inedible.  I'd also suggest they use only mozzarella (Polly-O preferably) and forego any additional types of cheese.  Recently the price has gone up so delivery is far from cheap.  LeMay's may be the best for miles around, but they're also not the only game in town.

Thankfully we had gotten a reservation a couple of days earlier and were seated right away.\\n\\nThis place is tapas-style so we ordered quite a few dishes to share amongst the three of us:\\n\\n-green beans with sesame seeds (3 stars)--These we didn't actually order, I think they came out as a starter for the table and were good, but nothing to write home about\\n\\n--coffee roasted golden beets (4 stars)--I didn't actually taste any coffee on these beats, but the texture on the outside of them really made it a unique dish. They were also cooked perfectly and basically melted in your mouth\\n\\n--burrata and fried pistachio (4 stars)--This dish was quite tasty with the burrata paired with the pistachio and crisp that it was served with. Flavors were there, I just wished they had a little more crisp to use for the plate\\n\\n--kale salad (5 stars)--Maybe the best kale salad I've ever had. The kale was very well-prepared and dressed perfectly. In addition, the dressing itself was delicious and had a great pepperiness that I really enjoyed.\\n\\n--shaved tongue-special (4 stars)--This dish had some good flavors, but I had a hard time separating them out. That being said, I still enjoyed the textures and tenderness of the meat.\\n\\n--charred broccoli (5 stars)--A dish that sounded pretty simple but was completed to perfection. Paired nicely with the hummus and a decent-sized portion as well.\\n\\n--lamb neck agnolotti (5 stars)--This pasta was so well cooked and paired with the tenderest of meats. A real winner of the night and a must try for anyone that enjoys pasta or lamb.\\n\\n--charred swordfish belly (5 stars)--This was actually my favorite dish of the night as it was cooked perfectly and paired well with the vegetable medley it was served over. A decent size as well.\\n\\n--corn pancakes (5 stars)--These pancakes were super dense and tasted wonderful when paired with the shishito peppers and sour cream. A nice spin on a classic dish.\\n\\n--pound cake (2.5 stars)--This was really the only dish of the night that didn't wow us. We originally were going to go for the bread pudding but felt a bit steered away by our waitress. This dish had the makings of a nice, light finish, but didn't quite hit mark for me.\\n\\nDrinks: I really enjoyed my forage and fire, as well as the taste I had of my friend's drink (the falling??).\\n\\nOverall, this place is electric, packed, and full of energy. One of the best meals I have had in Boston and a fun place to try out a different spin on some American classics.

It was hot and crunchy good. The pretzel, was a baguette-sized bat, crunchy, salty on the outside and soft and warm on the inside served with spicy mustard and a good IPA beer cheese. \\n\\nThe signature dish is the Sublime burger... The bun of this burger is two glazed doughnuts but nothing like the kind you'd find at \\"Krispy Kreme\\" or \\"Dunkin' Donuts\\". The grilled ring glazed doughnut provides a texture that is closer to an English muffin... light, crispy and airy with the perfect combination of savory and sweet. The doughnuts, thick-cut bacon, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese and expertly grilled beef patty accompanied by a tasty barbecue sauce are the unlikeliest of dance partners but no one steps on each other's toes. The accompanying hand-cut fries are also good; ask for them crispy.\\n\\nWe also tried four other offerings. The night's special of grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes and green beans was comforting. The turkey burger was a hit.  A cranberry mayo, arugula and crispy fried onions accompanied the surprisingly juicy burger - a veritable Thanksgiving in a bun. The chicken potpie stumbled a bit; it was overpowered by the buttermilk biscuit crust and the pudding-like cream sauce filling with few pieces of chicken to be found and even fewer carrots and English peas. The Beef on Weck was less than satisfying as well. This sandwich is often served hot or cold in New York state, where it originates from. Cypress's version was served cold, very cold. The roast beef was jaw challengingly chewy and the hard roll added to the task. There was only the faintest hint of au jus on the roll; had there been more or had the beef been rewarmed in the au jus, perhaps this sandwich would have been more to our liking.\\n\\nThe sublime doughnut dessert was another highlight. The vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle made for just the right endnote.\\n\\nThe wait staff was friendly and informative. There is obvious a team effort at play here as several different servers refilled our water glasses during our visit.

When I moved to America, I had only one problem here. The food sucked. Especially the ramen.\\n\\nFast forward 12 years and Austin is experiencing a mini-boom in ramen. There are three places to choose from Tatsuya, Daruma and Michi. Without a doubt, Tatsuya is the BEST ramen I've had in America and certainly the most authentic. \\n\\nConveniently for you, person on the internet, Yelp has already compiled over 400 other opinions on what somebody else thought of this place. What more can I add? The tonkotsu soup is fantastic,  the noodles are great but I would have liked them to be thicker to compliment the hearty broth. I'm nit picking though as Tastuya would have to put a turd in my soup to knock it down a star, it's that good. The side salad is an excellent value and sliced extremely thin - just another minor detail I appreciate. Prices are reasonable, not cheap - but like I've already said, this is some of the best ramen outside of Japan.\\n\\nThe bathroom is incredible... but it could be an outhouse with no walls and I would still love this place. The line isn't that bad. Maybe I've been lucky but my average wait to be seated is about 10 minutes. \\n\\nClosing thoughts: This would be a 4.5 star place in Japan - that's a huge compliment. In America, it's hands down the best ramen place I have been to. Daruma comes in at a generous three star and Michi... well they need to try harder. \\n\\nTastuya is a true taste of Japanese ramen that borders on the sublime. If you disagree then you just don't get it. We're all entitled to our opinions but it's really like saying The Beatles were one of the best bands ever - sometimes you just need to accept subjective opinions as fact and let Tastuya claim the honor of best ramen in Austin."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food is very good and location is in the heart of the city.

Wed have a cold soda for him...it worked. I recently moved to natick after becoming handicapped. I ordered libs and OH MY, was there a big change. We've all known of the prostitution ring that liberty's has been a part of for the past few years. However, I was equally as disappointed in the way that liberty is has chosen to treat its handicapped patrons. When the call came to my apartment. The liberties delivery more I was downstairs, I suggested he use the call box as I am handicapped. He flat out told me no. I again said but I am handicapped so I can't come down and get the pizza from you please use the call box. He again said no. I had to go down with my two crutches ask him to explain why he wouldn't use the box, and he said oh I didn't know you were handicapped. So I looked at the pizzas in his hand and I said am I guessing I need to carry these up to my apartment by myself? He said yes and walked away. I called liberty's Pizza almost immediately the owner or whoever answered the phone, made excuse after excuse siting not knowing the English language as a reason for his behavior. let me tell you, I have come into contact with many people who did not speak the English language while I have been handicapped, and human decency is just that, human decency.

The waiter was pretty attentive outside of the fact that when he was removing my soup bowl (the teppanyaki lunches are served with soup but I never eat it) he spilled some of the broth in my dining space and failed to get a towel and wipe it up. You'll always see a great show along with dinner here at Tokyo as your dinner is prepared right before your eyes over on the hibachi side at the tables with their built-in grills. The only thing with this is that if you don't have enough people in your party to fill a table you will end up being seated with strangers, so if you don't like that type of a dining arrangement (as it can feel a bit awkward for some) I would recommend sitting over on the other side of the restaurant where you can dine at your own table minus the show. Parking here can be a little tight because there are only 7 or 8 spots available, two of which are for handicapped. But if you can't get a space right in front there is always plenty of space in the lower level of the garage at the South Shore Plaza just across the way.

Better food and price at Anna's BBQ on Hosea Williams. No frills, but high quality."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Good American style Indian food. The only reason I give it three stars instead of four is that it didn't seem very authentic. Still good though. Service is very fast and prices are decent. They have three Indian beers which are pretty good as well, not the more common ones though. \\n\\nThe samosa was tasty as was the tandoori chicken. The hard part about tandoori is since it's baked, not letting it dry out. This tandoori was very juicy still and not overcooked. Also tried the chicken Tikka masala which was very good. We ordered some Nan and the Nan was very thick. Non traditional but very tasty. \\n\\nI'd recommend this place, just don't expect authentic spice or taste."},{"name":"The Greenery Creamery","address":"420 E Church St, Unit 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Cutest and tastiest ice cream in Orlando hands down. Also super friendly for those who are lactose intolerant because they have vegan flavors! Nice for the tummy and nice for the wallet. Hard to believe due to the fantastic quality of their ice cream. \\n\\nThe flavors are truly unique and you can tell they work hard to give customers new and exciting flavors each week, so don't expect to have the same flavor the week after! While my friend and I were there they were experimenting flavors on the side for the next week which I thought was a cool process to watch. \\n\\nThe staff UGH THE STAFF! SOOOOO FREAKING FRIENDLY! They were handing us samples left and right letting us try all the flavors even asking how our day was. Such personable personalities and kind people which is a major plus especially for a new business. \\n\\nThe ice cream I bought was a mix of their Cinnamon Roll and Coffee ice cream and it was extreeeemely delicious!!! I hate coffee and so I hate coffee flavored things as well but this ice cream scratched all of that for me. It also contained bits of a gooey cinnamon roll in it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I cannot stop thinking about this place and will return for sure."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We decided to make the trip( a whole 3 miles) from the hotel. Waited about 30 minutes around dinner time. We waited at the bar before being seated. Bar prices were reasonable. Sat down and had awesome BBQ. Anytime someone asks about BBQ In ATL that's where I send them! Note: it gets really busy after 6ish. There were 50 people waiting outside when we were leaving!"},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I love burgers, so I'm really hard on burger places. But the burgers here were amazing. I had the hamburgesa burger, which is a burger topped with guacamole, black bean roasted corn agave salsa, fried chorizo, red onion, spicy mayo, and your choice of cheese. Yes, it tasted as good as it sounded. Lol. All the flavors blended together well.  Also, one ignored aspect of the burger is the actual bun. The bun here may have been one of the best buns I've tasted. If you like burgers, I'd recommend this place as they have a wide assortment of different burgers with interesting topping choices."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in here after visiting Fenway Park.  It's only a block away from the park.  I was a little confused with the outdoor window, but you can order and eat inside.  I did see a couple order from the outside, not realizing they couldn't bring it inside.  Something to note, especially when you don't want to sit outside.   Ordered the Big Tasty and got the Starving Student, which included a beer.  Both were around $10 and the kid's meal around $6, which I thought was reasonable.  Burger was fine and enjoyed the meal."},{"name":"J Christophers","address":"250 E Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"Perfect little breakfast spot!

I used the drive-up window to order, and after ordering and waiting at the window a minute or so, the man at the window asked me to park in the parking lot and wait for my order. I had been asked to do this before at this location for no apparent good reason (no cars in line behind me), so I asked him why? He explained that the manager gets a bonus for moving cars quickly through the drive-up line, and she didn't want to get dinged for taking too long with my order. I replied that they had better hurry up then. A minute later, the same guy came to the window and said \\"My manager wants you to move your car to the parking lot.\\" I demanded a refund and left without a meal. Needless to say, I will not be dining at this Wendy's again.
