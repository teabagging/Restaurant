Move over, CamiCakes - you've finally got some viable competition.  \\n\\nFood: Sweet Cheats is best known for its cupcakes - and rightfully so. The flavor profiles are innovative, the portions are generous, and the aesthetics are impeccable. They also offer an assortment of breakfast items and other baked treats, including \\"cruffles\\", which are best be described as the love child between a cupcake and a truffle. During my recent visit, I opted for several different cupcake flavors, including White Chocolate Obsession, Crunchy Monkey, Southern Seduction, Chocolate Dream, and Sweet P. All the cupcakes were absolutely delightful, but the real standout was the Sweet P - just when I thought it couldn't get any better than a white chocolate cupcake with peanut butter cream cheese frosting, I discovered that they added a white chocolate peanut butter cup into the center of the cupcake - simply ingenious. My only complaint with the cupcakes is that they do not travel well - the wrappers are not particularly sturdy and the boxes that they use do not have individual compartments to stabilize the cupcakes - as such, the cupcakes lose their form when boxed in larger quantities. \\n\\nService: All orders are placed at the front counter and there is no waiter service, so the extent of employee interaction is minimal. Nonetheless, the staff are all friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about the products. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Quaint, clean, and welcoming. The cupcakes and pastries are neatly presented and labeled in a showcase.  Both indoor and outdoor seating options are available. \\n\\nCost: At $4/single, $23/half dozen, and $40/dozen, Sweet Cheats offers some of the most expensive cupcakes in Atlanta - however, the quality is commensurate with the hefty price tag. Other pastries range in price between $2 and $5 each. \\n\\nOther: Sweet Cheats is closed on Monday's. Hours of operations are Tuesday-Friday, 7AM-8:30PM, Saturday, 8AM-8:30PM, and Sunday, 8AM-7PM.

Unfortunately the plate itself wasn't memorable... fried little balls of something. \\n\\nMy entree was fried chicken, lobster mac and cheese and sauteed vegetables ($17). The chicken was a little dry, especially the salty breading. They do the 'airline' cut here. Wahoo in Decatur makes excellent fried chicken using this cut, so I ordered with visions of that. No such luck. The mac and cheese was inoffensive and mild, with little lobster flavor despite visible chunks of crustacean. The sauteed vegetables were good at least!?\\n\\nCurries are $14. My wife had the panang, which was almost insipidly sweet. Our two companions had pad thai and red curry, which were also apparently underwhelming. \\n\\nI suggested this place to friends based on the sterling yelp score, but at the end of the night everyone had that 'I'm not gonna trash the place but I don't want to go here again' vibe.  \\n\\nParking is a complimentary valet.

I was running on Southern time anyway (in other words, SLOW).\\n\\nMy meal was pretty good. I had the fish with fresh vegetables while my mom had a sandwich. Out of curiosity, we ordered the boston baked beans. Now my boyfriend had warned me that I'd probably hate it, but I didn't see how I could possibly hate baked beans. They symbolize the very essence of BBQ. Little did I realize they meant that only in the south. My stomach could only tolerate a few bites and we left a whole bowl of the stuff sitting there. Not quite the fault of the restaurant, but ugh!\\n\\nService was decent, though not entirely friendly. Of course, my standards for friendly service come from the hospitality of the South, so again, probably a little biased. Yet when my mom - a former Floridian (which stands for Northerner) - asked for unsweet tea, the waitress got stern and scolded her saying, \\"That's all we ever serve up here, ma'am.\\" Okay, so the server had a point, but really? Snapping about it? Not so kosher anymore, yikes.\\n\\nOverall, it could be worth a look, but I'd say skip the sit-down portion and head straight to the bar. Get an appetizer, have a Sam Adams, then go about your business. It's at least worth a stop-in for being the oldest restaurant in Boston, but otherwise there isn't much reason for a return trip unfortunately."},{"name":"Hall Street Grill","address":"3775 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"What a great spot, really friendly, excellent staff always working hard to make our evening a winner. \\n\\nBig thanks to Loie and Mr. P along with all the dedicated and exceptional servers for making our visits very enjoyable.

This is the kind of place that I typically like - small, casual, nonassuming. Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment. The restaurant is quite small, which is not terrible in itself. Geta Sushi in Oakland makes this place seem like Versailles. However, the close confines are combined with a frenetic staff hustling to serve long lines of people and bus tables as quickly as possible, which basically creates an environment that resembles a WWI battle trench.\\n\\nAgain, that in itself wouldn't be a dealbreaker - i'd gladly serve on the Maginot Line if the rations were high-quality brunch fare. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with The Paramount's actual food as well. I got a Western omelette, which was probably the best dish of the morning. It was good, but fairly small. It came with home fries that were rather mediocre. They had put some kind of spice on the potatoes that tasted good, but the potato texture was kind of mushy and chalky. Probably the worse dish was my wife's waffle. Although she got lots of fruit, the waffle itself was soggy. I ended up eating about a quarter of it and though I liked the dough, the texture really was pretty subpar. Moreover, the cost was not that much less than the Beacon Hill Bistro, which was quite a bit better, and certainly much more than comparable places in the Bay Area with superior food."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.....they need more locations."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Overall we liked Mary Mac's.

Bangladeshi food is like a less spicy version of Indian food. But the strong flavors from various spices are still there. \\n\\nWe went in on a Friday night, and it looked busy. The servers recommended us to make a reservation for dinners on weekends since they do get busy. I agree. You should make a reservation on the weekends. It is a small space, and it looks popular. We were lucky to get a seat since we went a early.\\n\\nCurrently, until Christmas (Dec 25, 2012), they are having a prix-fixe dinner special. You get a ton of food with unlimited champagne or beer for $25, which includes tax. You have to have at least 2 people to get this prix-fixe dinner so if you want to get it, make sure to at least bring a date. The special looked good so we decided to get that.\\n\\nThe first course was the Aloor Chop which were your standard deep fried potato patties. I liked it. It had lots of flavor, had a nice, crispy skin, and I loved the fresh yogurt and tamarind sauce it came with. \\n\\nThe entrees were Kalojeera Lamb, Chicken Naar Kaylee Kola, and Papay Moogayr Tok-jhaal (lentil dish). The lamb dish was marinated with a bunch of spices and cooked. I liked it. A few of my lamb pieces seemed tough though, but the rest seemed fine. I loved the strong flavors I got from the spice marinade. \\n\\nI loved the chicken dish. It was very creamy and sweet thanks to the bananas and coconut they cooked with. I'm not a fan of sweet dishes in general, but this worked. I never knew chicken and bananas would taste good. And you get some slices of bananas in this dish. That was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nThe lentil dish was a good vegetarian dish. It was also sweet and acidic because of the papaya. I love yellow lentil entrees at Indian restaurants, and this seemed like a decent one. \\n\\nAlone with those 3 entrees, we also got some garlic naan and biriyani. The biriyani was a vegetarian rice dish with a ton of vegetables. It tasted okay. Sometimes, I would bite into a huge chunk of cardamom when eating the biriyani, and that would shock my tastebuds. I didn't like that.\\n\\nThe garlic naan tasted good. I loved the garlic flavor. It went well with the chicken, lamb, and lentil dishes. \\n\\nFor dessert, we got some baked yogurt. It was like a frozen yogurt. The consistency was hard. It had a nice, sweet, and tarty taste to it. \\n\\nFor $25, getting all these food felt like a great deal. I think the kicker was the unlimited champagne or beer it comes with. So if you like to drink, this is a great dinner to get. I'm not a champagne connoisseur. But I liked my champagne. It tasted sweet and felt like a soda. I don't think it had much alcohol in it because after 4-5 glasses, I wasn't feeling anything. \\n\\nThe service seemed very friendly. I didn't get any salesman-y tactics thrown on me like the other reviewers have said. It's probably because I got the prix-fixe menu so they couldn't upsell me on anything. \\n\\nThe food did come out very slowly. It took about 20-30 minutes between the potato appetizer and the entrees. I'm not sure if it was because it was a Friday night and was busy, or that's their standard operating procedure. \\n\\nBesides their current Holiday special, they have a coupon or a Yelp deal where you can get 25% off dinners Tuesdays through Thursdays. That's pretty cool. They are closed Mondays so don't go on a Monday.

Let me just say it put a spell on me.  Where I live, in the land of plastic, we don't have that many donut stores, let alone donut stores that I feel compelled to write odes to. We have a 24 hour donut place in my neck of the woods but the flavor is no where near the intense pleasure I got from Voodoo donuts. Hi, I'm Christine and I'm a sugar-holic. \\n\\nVoodoo doughnuts was my first stop when I arrived in Portland. (aka PDX by the locals. Fine, I call my land The OC, so we're even). When I arrived the line wasn't bad, since it was drizzling out, or maybe I just got lucky?\\n\\nThe pressure to choose which donuts I was gonna have was intense. NOTE TO OWNERS: I wish there was a menu posted outside so I could be thinking about what I want before I stepped in the door.  Choosing just a couple donuts from 90 on the menu cranked my anxiety level up to 11. Some reviewers left notes about the service. It's a Doughnut Store, people! The girl that helped me was great, she took the time to find me the right size of shirt, and knowing I was a tourist, she even asked me if I wanted a pink box. I don't expect 3 Star Michelin service in a doughnut store. (And it's not like the employees were like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld.) \\n\\nI chose the Portland Cream, a Maple Bar, Chocolate Cake and the Peach Fritter. The Peach Fritter is like an apple fritter, except, well, you get it. Slightly crisp on the outside and soft, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness on the inside. Then, to take you completely over the edge, they cover it with luscious white frosting. I was in a complete sugar and carb coma after I ate it, but it was the best doughnut I've ever eaten!  I seriously had to restrain myself from not eating all of my sweets at once, but days later, the Chocolate Cake doughnut still tasted awesome. \\n\\nMy theory is that not only do these people REALLY know how to make yummy doughnuts, but the fact that they are making them 24/7 means you get the freshest donuts possible. \\n\\nThe names of the donuts are risque, so I'd advise that you not take children in who can read the menu and have any bit of smarts about innuendo! Need a dozen donuts for a Bachelorette Party?  Then the \\"Cock and Balls\\" are for you.  Over-the-Hill party sweets for an aging man?  How bout the \\"Old Dirty Bastard\\"?\\n\\nDecor inside is twisted. No really. Don't forget to check out their T-shirts. My teen son LOVES his shirt with the Voodoo Doughnut logo. \\n\\nI can't wait to go back to Portland so I can go back to Voodoo Donuts."},{"name":"Juliano's Pizzeria","address":"15606 SE Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Pizza piled high with quality toppings.\\n\\nPizza suggestions: The Big Mike or The Hefty Ho!"},{"name":"Coconut Cafe","address":"759 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely terrible.

Without a doubt, the maple bacon bar is the best and only notable doughnut and that, combined with the vendor's quirky style, is the reason I'm giving the place 4 stars. \\n\\nThe maple bacon bar:\\nIt teeters on the razor-thin boundary between too sweet and just right. With the fluffy texture of the dough, it is a delicately crafted, sweet nugget of heaven. I expected the bacon on the doughnut to be bland, but it was absolutely perfect. It had the right crunch and flavor and it perfectly complemented the maple frosting.\\n\\nMany may disagree with my thoughts of the bar, and I may be biased because I love maple syrup on my bacon.... but that should not stop you from visiting this place if you're in the area.\\n\\nCons: the wait, service is meh, only love one of their doughnuts (others are nothing special)."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Can get crowded and noisy once it becomes more of a bar at night, but still worth it.

We got the blueberry blitzes w/ sweet ricotta (not too sweet, and all 3 were devoured in minutes) and hummus/avocado tartine (super refreshing, and very fulfilling - a healthy option for sure) for breakfast.

I was looking so forward to coming here and my experience was awful and I don't want anyone else's evening to be ruined like mine was. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had been planning a special evening last night for my 25th birthday. He went over and over restaurants to go to and finally settled on Alana's. He made reservations for 7:30 and we were so excited to go because just the night before, we were with 2 friends who said it was amazing and the best dinner they had had in Columbus. We arrived right on time at 7:30, got seated right away, and then everything went downhill from there. \\n\\nFirst of all, the place was not crowded. I want to make that clear. The room we were seated in had 12-14 tables and when we arrived, 4 tables around us were empty. The hostess told us she was out of menus, but would bring one when they became available. We sat for 15 minutes drinking water and talking and finally, a man that appeared to be the manager said, \\"You guys don't have menus? Let me get you some!\\" He did and left us to look over them. Him bringing those menus to us was the last time anyone talked to us for a half hour. No one, not one waiter, the hostess, the \\"manager\\", anyone looked or talked to us again for 30 minutes. We kept trying to flag someone down to ask to be helped, but no one was even walking by us or looking at us for us to do it. It was like we were invisible. 4 tables around us were sat and waited on while we were seated waiting. We sat there a total of 45 minutes with no drink, no food, no service. Finally, I looked at him and said, \\"Let's just leave. I don't want to give this place our money.\\" \\n\\nAs we walked out, the hostess said, \\"Thanks so much! Have a good evening!\\" I kept walking because I was upset, but my boyfriend turned around and said, \\"We sat there 45 minutes and no one talked to us or offered to take a drink order or an appetizer order and so we are just deciding to leave. Have a good night.\\" Her response was, \\"Oh, I wish you would have told me, we would have worked something out!\\" Well...that's ridiculous. We saw how small this place was(again, only 12-14 tables where we were sitting) and there were plenty of waiters and there were even 2 people working just filling water glasses up. We'd read reviews of this place and heard the service was slow and some of the waiters were rude, but we didn't even get slow service or rude service.  We got no service. And that is unacceptable. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I do not go out to fancy places often. We go out for special occasions and we try to pick special places to go. He chose this place and we intended to spend a lot of money. We were going to get a few drinks apiece(give or take $30), an appetizer($15), and 2 \\"surprise\\" entrees($40-45 a piece). We were going to spend a pretty penny and not only did we not last night, but we will never be back and I intend to share this story with as many people as I can because no one deserves to be ignored like we were.

I'm pretty sure they are shipped in from elsewhere and not particularly fresh. Go to a place that specializes in desserts instead. \\n\\nThe service is sort of hybridized.

Here's just two of the worst experience we've had out of the many examples we have: \\n\\n1) We clearly state and emphasize that I'm allergic to sesame and ask for a California roll without sesame seeds. Easy, right? No other sushi place mixes this up, but Katana has mixed it up twice. Which would usually be okay except for the fact that the second time this happened, they tried to PICK OFF the sesame seeds from the roll instead of remake a new one. I insisted on a new one and it was obvious that annoyed the workers. PLUS the restaurant was empty and we were made to wait for our food while the waiters finished their conversation at the bar... even after the mix up they were talking and laughing away while the roll was sitting there ready to be brought to our table. My boyfriend was already done with his roll by the time my new roll got to the table. I had to stand up, walk up to them at the bar and say something to them. This was the worst experience and it was obvious that the waitress didn't care.\\n\\n2) Every time we call to order pick up, usually between 8-9pm, we're told that we can't order until 9:30pm. That's fine. We call back at 9:30pm and are told that they did last call and that we can't order... what? This has happened multiple times and it's extremely frustrating. Doesn't matter if it's Wednesday or Saturday, busy or empty. We've called and been told that they can't take pick up orders because they're busy. So we begrudgingly come in and end up being the only 2 people sitting down in the entire restaurant...We live 2 minutes away and prefer to have our sushi dinner at home, but apparently they don't care and would rather lie to not have to service someone. \\n\\nI could go on, but for the price we're paying I expected at least decent customer service.

It was a generous size piece of what must have been day boat cod.  The fish was exquisitely fresh.  My family is in the seafood business.  I know fresh fish.  This was unbelievably fresh fish.  The fish was lightly dusted with coarse potato flour, cooked, and then topped with a ceviche of lime juice and Jonah crab.

When I walked in the atmosphere was electric.  We had a semi private room which was located to the left as soon as you walked in the door.  The place had tall ceilings, beautiful red colors with dark lighting and flickering light that would catch your eye of fire coming out of the walls.  It was a homerun for atmosphere.  \\nFirst course:  choice of Salmon Chips, Empanada or Fried Green Tomatoes\\nA friend of mine and shared so I could taste more.  The Salmon chips were excellent however I really enjoyed the empanada more.  We both agreed that the flavor was fantastic and we liked that it had a little heat to it.  \\nSecond Course: Salad: Caesar Salad.  It was okay...was surprised that it also had a little heat to it.  Just a filler and after a couple of bites I didn't waste my time.  \\nThird Course: Your choice of Chicken, Steak or Fish (turned out to be scallops).  I ordered the Scallops and they were out of this world.  Cooked to perfection and served on top of the cheese grits.  They were so yummy that days later I'm still thinking about them.  I tried the steak that my friend ordered and it was very good.  Had a lot of flavor and was tender.  I would still recommend the scallops over the steak.  \\nFourth course: Dessert...the best course!!! Your choice of Carrot Cake, Chocolate Bread Pudding or Banana Cr√®me Brulee with homemade vanilla wafers.  \\nI love chocolate so I ordered the Chocolate Bread Pudding. It was served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, with white chocolate.  It was very good with cinnamon flavor and berries.  It really had a lot of flavor.

Once our orders were placed the food came out quickly (I have attached pictures of the entree's). One person in the party got deviled eggs as an appetizer. Everyone enjoyed them I definitely recommend trying them. The chicken was not seasoned much but it was tasty. The macaroni however,was a complete miss. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you like noodles swimming in cheese and grease. The stand out item for me were the potato yams. They were absolutely delicious.

The hot toddy Tea was Perfect ! The seafood spring rolls are a must have and the lobster fried rice OMG! It's slightly mild and spicy but a tad sweet with A Polynesian flare but when you add the fried lobster tail on top there's a hint of Southern cuisine with an absolute beautiful presentation. Their mussels are swimming in this lemongrass coconut base broth that absolutely makes you want to pick up the bowl and drink it ! They serve it with a side of bread they know you will have elbows down and sopping it up is allowed lol ...seeing that I have had a dish similar to this in Thailand the authenticity of it is absolutely delightful.\\nGreat date night or small groups, but due to the small quaint seating space I would highly recommend a reservation. They do have valet service which takes your phone number when you drive up and you simply text them when you are ready to pick up your car just a nice added featured benefit of the Reaturant. \\nThe other thing to mention about the portion sizes is they are absolutely huge so all the price points maybe a little on the pricy side but you could easily share any one of these dishes with one or two more people. \\nThis is truly one of Atlanta's fully spots so whether you are going to sit at the bar and have one of their signature drinks and by the way I highly recommend the red sangria... or enjoy your wonderful cuisine of fusion blended foods you are in for a treat and you will definitely come back again."},{"name":"Malabar Authentic Indian Cuisine","address":"2297 East Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down this place deserves 5 stars!

There are no price breaks here - each doughnut is individually priced, so our dozen was about $24.\\n\\nWhile the maple bacon bar was phenomenal, I have to give my \\"personal favorite\\" vote to the oreo raised ring.

I had ordered the Grindhouse Burger, just because I love grilled onions.  Since it was the first week they were open, the restaurant was super packed, which is understandable.  I had to wait an hour to get my food.  But then my order got screwed up.  My burger was supposed to have grilled onions and some sort of happy sauce on it.  It had neither of those things - just lettuce and tomato.  So I sent my burger back to get it fixed.  The 2nd time around, it had cheese and pickles on it, in addition to the lettuce and tomato.  By then, I was so damn hungry, I ate the burger.  It was OK, but I just wanted some grilled onions.  Rumor has it Grindhouse had run out of some of their ingredients that night, due to the number of people that were there that night.\\n\\nI'm not too terribly upset about what happened.  It's completely understandable that a restaurant might have a few things to work out especially after being open for only one week.\\n\\nDespite my crappy first experience, I decided to give Grindhouse another try.  I ordered the Grindhouse Burger again.  This time it came with all of the fixins'.  I'll admit, it was a tasty burger - but not the best I've had.  I'd take a burger from The Vortex or Farm Burger over a burger form Grindhouse.\\n\\nOn the flip side, I do greatly appreciate the robot decor.

This was served in a significantly more sophisticated manner, with a bed of goat cheese and a sprinkling of leaves on top.\\n\\nFor mains, we had a pasta and a salmon. The menu did not indicate that the pasta had a meat sauce though it turned out to be a beef tomato sauce. The pasta was served in a very homestyle way - no attempt to garnish the plate or arrange the sauce in an appealing manner. The salmon was better, with white and purple cauliflower, though it was also served on a bed of cauliflower sauce, which tasted suspiciously like a thicker version of the soup.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had a peach cobbler/tart and a cr√®me br√ªl√©e.

Okay first off, there's valet parking for that little like strip of bars and restaurants which is running off of donations, I was very confused not seeing the sign for the price but hey, that was cool lol. So on a Saturday night it wasn't packed nor empty, it was a good noisy medium that was totally acceptable. There is like a patio kind of seating in front first which is where you stand to be seated, but instead of being seated the waitress told us we could sit where ever we liked. So we picked a little 2 person corner booth. The inside was decorated with old signs and banners, and lit with vintage style bulbs that glow almost yellow (not complaining though, it gives it a certain je ne said quoi). They have organic ketchup and maybe organic mustard on the table, along with organic sugar, sugar alternatives, and half & half in their Folk Art labeled glasses. I did not review the menu for long due to the fact that once I see a place with a fried chicken sandwich that's what I get and judge them on, other than decor and service and such. Our waitress was attentive and frequently came back to us with coke refills, which are free, always a plus. The kitchen was quick with getting out our appetizer, the fried pickles with buttermilk sauce and man was it great and I HATE pickles, but that sauce was awesome, oh I forgot one thing. Music. They had a solid playlist going on featuring bands like the Smashing Pumpkins and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Alright back to ordering, my girlfriend ordered the first salad on the menu, forgot the name of it, and it came with cranberries, grilled or saut√©ed chicken, and croutons. When our orders arrived to the table I was pleased with just the aesthetics of it, my sandwich looked fried to perfection with not too much of a leafy toppings some sort of white sauce (didn't ask but it was good) and topped off with a nice buttery bun; and then my girlfriend's salad, man, it was more cranberries, chicken, and croutons than salad lol. And that's NOT a complaint, there were not stingy with their toppings. My sandwich was indeed fried to perfection, beautiful crisp on the outside but a juicy chicken breast on the inside with that flavorful bun. Only downsides I have to say is the fries, even though crunchy and hand cut, were odd tasting, almost as is they were fried in old oil or perhaps an oil I'm not acquainted with, but the fact is they were too splendid and that was a bummer but hey, that sandwich made up for it, and yes I ate all the fries. Oh and one more disappointment, I was never asked if I wanted dessert and I didn't know if they had dessert but after looking at the photos on here and seeing the dessert I was disappointed I did not get to try it, perhaps next time. ANYWAY, this is totally a spot to check out near the city, valets, bad ass decor, good service, great food and tunes, and if you like gender neutral bathrooms, there you go."},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We were planning a trip to Texas de Brazil, looking for coupons to the restaurant.

They also didn't do the customary loud \\"irashaimase\\" to welcome all incoming people which is good practice in my opinion. My best wishes to this new business. \\n\\nYES, they take credit card. They use a sophisticated tablet with an attachable credit card reader for e-transactions and you can email yourself a receipt. \\n\\nMiso ramen $13- they have an abundant number of different toppings- wakame seaweed used in miso soup, a half boiled egg, 1 slice of pork, corn, green onions, minced pork, with a hefty serving of minced ginger. Their miso base is sweet not salty compared to pikaichi. To each their own. Soup base was flavorful.

I'm sure they'll work it out.  \\n \\n- Advertisement. The only reason I knew about this place was through facebook. Their location in Arcade Mall in Brookline is also quite hidden. They should be putting a sign outside the mall on the sidewalk so people know where they are. Having lived in Brookline for 6 years, only recently did I realize there even was a 'mall' there. It's not a mall per se-- just many small, independent shops- kumon, clothes alteration etc. Easy to miss. \\n\\n-Appetizers. Granted they just opened so they're probably working on making an expanded menu. Right now all they have is a single paper menu. How can you not have gyoza??\\n\\n-Per an article on Boston Eatery- they are working on an alcohol license. \\n\\n-Variety- perhaps it'd be better if they had some take out options as well given the large student population living around Brookline and Allston.

For a 30 minute wait on line, I'd have to say, I was impressed with the food, although my Spanish omelette (onions, peppers, mozzarella cheese + homemade salsa) could've been a little less salty. Their home fries were perfectly cooked and their whole grain french toast is probably the best in Boston (according to my Bostonian friend). The wait and the good food isn't a bargain though; breakfast + juice will cost you at least $15, and this is a service-free restaurant.

As dinner entrees, I got the Duck and my fiance got the the pork chops with bread pudding. Both again, had amazing flavor and were very enjoyable! I think I was more in the mood for what my Fiance got, so I liked his more, but we had NO complaints with our dishes by any means!\\n\\nIf we had to change anything, we got the gnocchi dessert that had bleu cheese and something that added the sweet factor. It's not something that we would usually jump to try, but we thought we would give it a shot since everything thus far was going good. Although it included gnocchi and bleu cheese, the description led us to believe it was going to be much sweeter. It was not bad, but we just had wished it was much sweeter to fix our sweet tooth craving!\\n\\nAll around, I rate De Novo 5 stars because the service was five stars in itself, which means a lot these days, because you don't see it as often as you would like.

Just one scallop covered in a soy sauce mixture and tons of onions. Pretty tasty, but not worth the money. And awkward to eat. I had to dig out of the small bowl it came out and push the onions to the side. The cheese plate was pretty good, but it was heavy on the jam side and light on the cheese side. The tartare was decent, but had too many raw red onions and the raw quail egg on the side was odd. The kebobs were the best part of the meal. Super tender and very flavorful. And decent portion size. The prawns were okay, but tasted nothing more than Red Lobster deep fried shrimp. And the causa was interesting. Not very flavorful.\\n\\nPerhaps we just don't know how to appreciate Peruvian food.

Trust me, I'm not a picky person when it comes to food, ask any of my friend. But this one was too FAT for me. I had to stop after about 15 mins and that was the last piece meat I had for the night.

It is beautifully decorated - city slick.  However, we had to wait 20 minutes for a table (we had reservations) and then they crammed three of us at a table for two.  The wait staff was attentive but because the table was small it was chaotic with removing glasses, silverware and then finding space to leave our food.  The food for the most part was fine but bland. It is outrageously priced.  $31 for a small piece of salmon!  We are in Burlington not the heart of Boston. The server said the chef cooks salmon between rare and medium rare and it came out very over done. We sent it back and it took another 15 minutes to have them cook another piece - which came out almost raw.  The menus are printed every day but are a jumble of different sized fonts and styles.  Gimmicky. And a waste of paper.

Snagged a reservation for an early dinner because I was bringing along my three very well-behaved children to celebrate with me. When we arrived, we were greeted at the door and shown to our table in the fairly empty restaurant. All the way to the very back, keep going, keep going, there! The very back dark corner. Perfect. Way to make me feel special. But hey, they didn't know it was a celebratory meal, right? Uh, wrong. I opened my menu a moment later to see \\"Happy Birthday!\\" Maybe I jumped to conclusions and this will be a special night after all. Very nice touch to print a personal surprise greeting in the menu. But no, it was not to be. Our waitress offered passable service. Definitely not warm but not rude. Just passable. We had to request children's menus (I knew they had them because I had double checked online that my children would be happy and welcome there.) so they did not come for awhile and we were delayed in ordering due to that, seemingly to our waitress's displeasure. And furthermore, there was absolutely no special pampering or even faux excitement over a birthday here. I don't want singing and clapping (or I'd go to Applebee's) but a warm sincere happy birthday and extra attention to detail to make my night outstanding would be awesome. Especially at this price point. But let's get to the food. The oysters were excellent, I sampled three. The children's menu is very good, no chicken fingers in sight. One of my children ordered off the kids menu (fish and chips) and it was a good portion and looked appetizing. Three of us ordered lobster rolls and I'd have to say they were just average. I admit I am somewhat of a lobster snob due to summering in Maine but really, this place should be able to nail a lobster roll. Fries and kettle chips are good. My husband enjoyed his clam chowder, but I thought it was heavy on the smoke flavor from the bacon and was very glad I didn't order it. He also enjoyed his lobster noodle dish, but I didn't try any so can't comment on it. We did appreciate the wine and beer list, however our first choice of beer was not in stock (although on the menu). We decided to pass on dessert as the experience just was falling flat. So no birthday cake for this girl. Overall, I might go back to try lunch or brunch, but definitely not for a special night out, as this was a disappointing birthday meal."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We're visitors in Boston,  and the Union Oyster House was on the bucketlist of must-sees.

The deep-fried oysters were good, but the roll thay came on was a bit much. And the french fries didn't match up to mine - a little under-done and whimpy. \\n\\nBoth our orders came with cole slaw. I doubt that we\`d go back for the cole slaw. \\n\\nI ordered the Boston Baked Beans to see what authentic BBBs were like.

My facebook/Instagram is filled with pictures of their food because I go there every week and I even recommended it to some friends which they are now addicted to it and I'm especially making business for them because of my 5,000 friends in Facebook. I'm also a fan of the Zinger Mountain Melt.\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that we waited 30 mins to be seated down and the hostess asked us a few times, do you still want to eat here?? Yes we waited. We got our drinks and shots everything was ok....till we got our food...my rib-eye was sitting on the kitchen pick up table for minutes because when it got to me it was cold. I'm not used to this bad service from them. Even the other day my boyfriend went to the manager to tell them what a great job they did with the rib-eye. It was so delicious and perfectly done, that the manager ask my boyfriend to praise the cooks himself and he did. Then my boyfriend's fajitas weren't sizzling either. I understand it's Valentine's day and they are in a hurry but it isn't my fault. I prefer to wait patiently and get my food nice and hot, no problem with me no hurry. \\n\\nI ask to get another steak, so then they bring me the same steak heated on the grill all burnt up with some mashed potatoes from the old plate attached and burnt to it, while I ask for medium rare it was now well done!! :( then I told them to please bring me a new one and then they bring me my mashed potatoes first, to bring me my broccoli later with my steak so by the time I got the food, my mashed potatoes were cold and the steak was good. Does it make any sense? They should have brought everything together like they were suppose to and like they always do! Don't bring me plate by plate. Then, they bring my boyfriend's hot fajitas but leave the tortillas out in the cold. So his fajitas were hot but the tortillas were cold. It was a disaster. He was really upset because come on guys it was Valentine's!! It could be any other day to ruin our food but not today. Then a server passed by us, with hot sizzling fajitas just how he wanted them which got him really upset. There was a server walking around with my steak to see which table did it belong to for 10 mins!! They when I got it again....guess what?? It was cold!! \\n\\nTerrible service and food!! Then when we get the bill they take out the food fine, because we return all the food and denied eating it but when we asked them about some shots that were on the bill which we specifically told our server to get us some specific shots not the $6.00 ones, the same ones that I ask for each time I go there, the big, huge manager that was there said that it wasn't the server's fault that he didn't give us the shot's we asked for and that we should have asked correctly. This is the first time this ever happens to me. It was easy! I ordered one Pi√±a Colada and 2 shots of tequila. And when I asked again about the shots, the same manager screamed at me \\"Get out of my restaurant and don't come back here ever again\\". He shouted that to us infront of the customers and servers. You don't talk like that to a customer, you just don't talk like that to a person! I have never ever in my life been treated so poorly and I was completly humiliated and embarrased. \\n\\nI work for the Orlando International Airport, a federal job and I have a Master's Degree in Clinical Psychology and believe me I have met some pretty crazy people and disrespectful people in my life but this manager beat them all. I never leave negative reviews and this is my first time. But I just had to let you know Orlando Ale House, you lost a loyal customer that always prefers to go to your restaurant on any given day. I even went there, than Red Lobster, which is the place my boyfriend wanted to go on such a special night and you ruined it for me."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Not to be a wet blanket, but I have to disagree with the rave reviews here.  I probably would want to rate Poor Calvin's a 3.5 if I could, but I also think the near perfect rating needs to be brought back down to Earth, hence my three stars.  I'm also not a huge Thai fan, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  \\n\\nI had wanted to go to Poor Calvin's for a while, and I did like the food here.  The menu had a lot of options that fused southern food with Thai/Asian cuisine.  My meal, which was \\"My  Best Friend's Meatloaf,\\" was pretty tasty and the kale mashed potatoes were also good.  The amount of food was also filling, and the price was reasonable.  I think my low marks are mainly for service.  The restaurant wasn't very crowded and service was almost painfully slow, from ordering/getting drinks to receiving the food itself.  \\n\\nOverall, the food was tasty, different, and well presented, but it wasn't something I'd go out of my way for again.  I'd like to give Poor Calvin's another chance, and perhaps I will, but quite frankly Atlanta has so many good options that it might be a while before I get around to it.

The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star is because the person bringing the order was actually nice.  The horrible service involves the guy taking the order.  When has it become okay to sit on the counter and take someone's order?  I at first gave him the benefit of the doubt, thinking he was injured or something. However that changed when I saw him moving around normally. I thought he was just rude to me, but throughout my meal I saw him on his phone before acknowledging a person, sitting on the counter and finally letting out the biggest yawn I have ever seen with a customer. The yawn would of been fine if he covered his mouth. I wouldn't be so annoyed if this was a one time problem with this place, but unfortunately it has been the norm when I've been here. Sadly the food makes up for it, but today it was lacking the normal spice.

We had the local hook up, and went to Mary Macs Tea Room. I love Southern food, and this was hands down the best overall Southern food I've ever had. Granted, I'm a native Californian, but this IS the place! I grew up with a grandfather from Texas that loved his chicken fried steak, pot roast and other American staples. At Mary Macs I opted for the fried chicken. Perfect flavor, best crispy delicious fried chicken I've ever had, ever. I could have done without the gravy on top of the fried food, didn't need it at all. Oh Lord, the sides, the wonderful delicacies! First off, the waiter brought me a taste teaser of greens. Yum, with the cornbread and rolls and cinnamon bread, yum. But the highlight was something called tomato souffl√©, never had anything quite so good. Squash souffl√©, broccoli souffl√©, OMG. WOW. WOW. WOW. Black eyed peas had that special flavor when they are cooked to perfection. Steamed cabbage, very good, but no pork, vegetarian??? Hmmm. I even drank sweet tea, just to try it out, well half sweet, half plain anyway. I can't say enough about this place. Funky house vibe, makes you feel right at home. I was told that there is usually a long line to get in, but we went at an off time and were seated right away. You have to write your order down on a pad. I actually prefer that so there is no chance that your order will be screwed up. I was impressed that the waiter could read everyone's writing. I loved Atlanta.

First of all let me say that we ate in the restaurant which I do think makes a difference because as the pizza got cooler the taste was definitely different. We got a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms. It came out nice and cheesey with light sauce and everything seemed fresh (my husband and I only like fresh mushrooms on our pizza). They serve coke products which is what we prefer and my husband got a nice cold bottle of Yuengling.\\nThey most definitely need to work on the cleanliness of the restaurant. Needs soap and water in the dining room and someone needs to come in and decorate and add tables. A very large restaurant with very few tables (all booths).

Austin probably has the most hot dog places in all of Texas which is great!

I had great, friendly service and they were very willing to answer any of my questions about the menu. \\n\\nI decided to try the Figgy Piggy with waffle fries and I believe I had the bacon ranch dipping sauce. \\n\\nFirst, I do like that they offer you all these dipping choices for the waffle fries. I usually do get ranch so I like that they've kind of incorporated that trend into the menu. However, the dipping sauce was kind of runny so I ended up wearing quite a bit! Couldn't it be thickened up or not as watered down? \\n\\nThe Figgy Piggy dog is a specialty dog (and I think it was $7). It was very good but I did think from the description that it would have a little more savory/sweet flavor. It was topped with delicious pickled red onions & blue cheese. I did enjoy it, with a knife and fork. I loved the bread...and I would more often then not order that french bread option. However, it does make picking up the dog and eating it traditional style a little difficult. \\n\\nEating with a knife and fork was a little bit more complicated as the size of the basket is such that it perfectly cradles the dog but doesn't leave much room for knife action. I did quite a bit of tearing up the paper that it's lined with too. Not sure if there are slightly bigger baskets out there but I may have to try just pulling the paper out of the basket next time.

I set our reservation two weeks prior with no problem. I was asked to call again on the day of our reservation to confirm the final number of guests. Complimentary valet is provided for all guests. When we arrived we were told that we couldn't be seated until our party was complete, which was fine but if you want to surprise a loved one it's good to know that in advance. Wasn't a huge deal though; he simply loved having those who could join us altogether to celebrate him. A couple people in our party were late due to traffic and waiting on babysitters, and they only hold reservations for 30 minutes after the reserved time. Thankfully, the host allowed us to be seated since the majority of our party was present. We had an entire teppanyaki station to ourselves. The waitress came quickly and answered any questions we had. The only slight downside that I heard from a couple of our guests was that veggies weren't included with the teppanyaki entree (soup, salad, and steamed rice are included -- can sub garlic rice for an additional fee), and that there were no preset meat combinations. All of those were listed as sides for an additional cost. Otherwise, there were no complaints. We received our soup and salad fairly quickly, and the chef came out to cook in a timely manner. Everyone enjoyed their food, from rock shrimp tempura and calamari tempura appetizers, teriyaki salmon, teriyaki chicken, bok choy and garlic butter fried rice to name a few. Another thing to note is that if you're on the teppanyaki side of the restaurant, you can't order from the main dining room's menu. Overall, nice laid-back ambience and good food.

To deal with this, they'd opened the doors, but as a result of THAT, there were flies everywhere! Hello, if you're sitting indoors, that is not a problem one should be expected to deal with. \\n\\nThe food was really, REALLY mediocre. Having tried a pretty large variety of the dishes, I can say that was pretty true across the board. I shared a frittata and waffles and they were both SO bland, especially the frittata! It tasted like cardboard dipped in eggs. And this may be a personal issue, but what is the deal with places selling \\"waffles with fruit\\" and then not putting any fruit on them?!? My god, if you're going to say the waffles come with fruit, it needs to be more than 3 slices of strawberries, or just don't say it at all. The hummus was pretty boring (and tasted like \\"Out to Lunch.\\" Notoriously the grossest hummus brand ever!) And the bread? People, I love bread, so when it lets me down, I get angry. Their jam (and gigantic jars of nutella) were nice, but i wish my bread had been more than just a nutella delivery vehicle. The brie and walnut tartine was pretty good, but other members of my group said they were not impressed with their other tartines.\\n\\nI wish I could have liked this place more, because the service was great and the space is great too.

Folks, Austin isn't a pizza town. It's a BBQ/TexMex town, with a solid Burger scene scattered with some solid chef driven restaurants. When it comes to NY style pizza (my favorite style), I'm a cheese slice purist.  Homeslice overall was just a decent slice.  It was a tad too thick in the middle and it was slightly bland and plain tasting. There were absolutely no savory/umami notes. It wasn't bad, it just wasnt great like all these glowing reviewers claim. In no way does it deserve 4.5 stars. I'm just being realistic. In fact it's saving grace was the tasty Italian toasted sub. The pizza is 3 stars but that sub was a 4. It was yummy. Therefore overall 3.5 stars. \\n\\nMaybe it was the fact that we had just been to Bianco's in Phoenix on our way to Austin which has the best crust and sauce ever, although to be fair it's not \\"NY style\\". Or maybe it's because I'm writing this review after the fact of doing a major pizza crawl in NY to places like Joe's (our overall favorite NY slice joint), New Park, Best Pizza, Di Fara's (preferred the square over the round), Patsy's, Prince Street's square, Two Boots (cornmeal crust, eek), J&V's and Roberta's (neapolitan). Or maybe I've actually had slightly better slices in LA which is admittedly also a shitty pizza town at spots like Joe's in Santa Monica and Vito's off La Cienega. \\n\\nWhatever the case Yelpers need to get a fucking clue and be realistic. That's why I never trust Yelp. I use it as a loose guide, and am always, ALWAYS skeptical. Most of my most respected foodie friends agree. Yelp sucks balls.

I think The Optimist, like many other trendy but well meaning restaurants has sacrificed the integrity of the food in an effort to be experimental or cool or even avante garde. For example, the beet salad, which is a mainstay of any \\"good\\" restaurant these days was accompanied by some weird cheese. It was semi-hard, tasteless and generally not a good pairing. It should have been goat cheese. Goat cheese with beets is just better, no need to switch it up just to differentiate YOUR beet salad from another beet salad.  Beets are rich and woody, you need that tartness to balance it. Likewise, the hush puppies, which come as a side WITH dinner were covered in powdered sugar. Were they yummy? Sure...But was it necessary? No. Did it in any way complement the fish? No. Did it come across as contrived and odd? Yes. It's all just trying too hard.\\n\\nApparently the oysters were good, but that says nothing of the restaurant except they order good oysters. The octopus was overcooked and overseasoned. The baby gem salad (basically a Caesar) was wayyyyyyyyyyyy overdressed to the point of being sopping with dressing. I mean that's such a rookie mistake.\\n\\nI ordered the skate wing schnitzel. It was ok. I found the taste to be lacking, you could really only taste the breading. The fish was unremarkable in every way. Moreover, it came with a brown butter sauce which itself was markedly bland. And because the fish was sitting in a pool of butter the whole thing was soggy and greasy. My father had what I think was snapper in a lime sauce. What it amounted to was a decent cut of fish (albeit also pretty flavorless) sitting in a pool of limeade with slices of lime. The sauce was not complex or interesting...it just tasted like straight up lime. I guess it was a passable dish because how bad can fish and citrus be? But certainly not worth thirty bucks and would have been ten times better if it were just a whole,grilled fish sprinkled with lime. \\n\\nHowever, the key lime push pop was delicious and adorable and MADE SENSE. \\n\\nSo, basically, as a a seafood restaurant they need to quit it with the gimmicks and just focus on the fish.

Ever since, I've stayed and visited Kennedy School many a time over the years.\\n\\nThe dilemma:  Where To Begin?\\n\\nSOAKING POOL\\nKennedy School has so many things going for it, it's hard to think of a place to start. \\n\\neuphoria (y-f√¥r'-, -fr'-)   n.  A feeling of great happiness or well-being.\\n\\nI think that's a good place to start, yes?  I love the Soaking Pool.  It's always a highlight during a stay at the School.  I plan my schedule around dipping myself in its magic waters (FYI, that's a movie quote).  The Soaking Pool is in one of the courtyard areas of the School.  It is a long pool with jets on one side of it (the timer's in the \\"Locker Room\\").  Basically, just set the timer to the maximum time and chill.  The Pool is surrounded by lush vegetation, and steam from the water adds an eerily cool ambiance.  I love it when it's cold outside, or better yet---raining--I love the contrasts.  Looking up at the sky through the palm fronds is mesmerizing.\\n\\nTHE ROOMS\\nI've never had a bad room here.  Each one is unique and is filled with its own story and art.  On a recent stay I was in \\"The Sewing Room\\".  All the rooms are HUGE, and come with a wall of chalk boards.  I've always liked the linens as well--I want the bed spreads they have!  For technological perks there is a phone and free wifi---THERE IS NO TV!  There is a ceiling fan & a heater (no AC---but not an issue in PDX).  There are usually used books in your room.  So yeah, you get to sleep in an old classroom, but the amenities here are top notch and modern.  I love the rooms.\\n\\nTHE BARS\\nOn this trip I made it to several of the bars:  Boiler Room, Detention Bar, and Cypress Room.  By far, my favorite was the Boiler Room.  This is the newest bar--I think it's only a year or two old.  It's a two-story bar where you enter from the top (pool table, tables, tvs), and then walk downstairs to the bar (more tables, pool table, and one of those curling/bowling-type games).  The drink-makers were always exremely friendly.  I generally sat at the bar, and had libation, and ordered food from the kitchen.\\n\\nTATER TOTS + BEER = THE BOMB\\n(learned that from my Math class at Kennedy School).\\n\\nMASS TRANSIT\\nI drove to Kennedy School, but my vehicle stayed in the parking lot for virtually all four days I was there.  There is a bus stop right in front of Kennedy School!  So freakin' convenient.  The #73 & I were like this:  **crossing my fingers**!  The #73 takes you to the Llyod Center Transit Center and from there, fuggedaboutit--PDX is yours.  I love mass transit.  (The Environmental Studies class taught me that at Kennedy School--gots ta save the Earf!).\\n\\nFUN STUFF\\nKennedy School is like one of those all-inclusive resorts.  You can pretty much stay on the premises the whole time and be totally content.  Admission to any movie is free when you have a room here.  I love the theater.  It is filled with cozy and old school couches & chairs along with tables.   And then you can also drink a brew & have a pizza while enjoying the cinema. \\n\\nMusic is also big here, there are always bands here throughout the week.\\n\\nAnd there are also events as well.  I was there during Halloween.  I must admit, this place was madcap traffic jam of kids, but it was cool.  The kids were all trick or treating and having a good ole time (Kennedy School does many things for the local community).  On Halloween Night, Kennedy School was filled with all kinds of costume crazyness.  My favorite costumes:  The Stimulus Package, Wolverine, and Waldo, but my favorite was Magnum PI!\\n\\nIN CONCLUSION:\\nTo me, there is nothing gooder (sorry failed English!) than Kennedy School.  I've been going for the last decade, and know I'll keep going:  I'm just dumb, and need to continue my education!!\\n\\n\\n* SPANISH HOMEWORK:\\nTranslate This:     ¬°Y √©se es seteciento!"},{"name":"Pei Wei","address":"12913 Galleria Cir, Ste 101","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"2","text":"Great customer service by the manager, I think he said his name was Ashton.

Don't let that deter you from eating here, though! (Can you tell I used to give Ghost Tours?)\\n\\nANYWHOO this is one of my favorite spots in the Beacon Hill neighborhood and arguably the entire city of Boston! I love how it has two kinds of vibes - one for day, and one for night. Visit in the morning for a casual atmosphere with counter service and snappy, fast paced waitstaff and cooks yelling orders to each other, or at night, for a completely different scene that is more upscale and sophisticated, with ambient lighting and table service. Experience-wise AND food-wise, the Paramount has something for everyone! Certified Morganic faves include:\\n\\nBlack Bean Burger: The Paramount does this vegetarian staple proud, with a flavorful and tender veggie patty stacked high with avocado, lettuce, and tomato, and sandwiched between a soft and buttery brioche bun. For the perfect pairing, order some sweet potato fries on the side to round out your meal of earthly delights.\\n\\nCaramel Banana Shake: I DREAM OF THIS SHAKE 5-EVER.

We had a 6:30 reservation and were promptly seated.  My wife and I were both really looking forward to the food, as it had been so spectacular the first time. The appetizers and drinks were as good as we remembered.  When our steaks arrived, my wife noticed hers was too well done and not how she asked for it.  We didn't raise a fuss; we only pointed out that the steak wasn't the way my wife wanted it.\\n\\nThat's when The Bancroft showed how much they want people to have a great experience.  Immediately our waiter took the steak to the kitchen.  A couple minutes later he told us the error was being remedied and that one of the managers was involved.  A few minutes after that our waiter assured us it would be out momentarily.  Less than two minutes later, a manager brought the steak to the table along with a new, smaller order of mashed potatoes.  She expressed how sorry she was for the steak not being done right and asked my wife to cut into the new steak to make sure it was done properly.  The steak was perfect.  The manager said \\"Great.  And make sure to save room for dessert.\\"  We were going to order dessert anyway, but it was nice to know The Bancroft wanted to do something for us.\\n\\nWhen the bill arrived, the desserts were comped and our waiter expressed how sorry he was that our experience wasn't perfect.  An overdone steak isn't the worst thing you can experience when dining out, not by a long shot, but it was awesome to see how seriously everyone took the idea of each diner having a perfect meal.  The food is amazing, no doubt about it.  More importantly, the customer service is top-notch.  The Bancroft was among my most frequently recommended restaurants after we ate there the first time.

The person, whom I assume was the hostess, came and left the stand three times without even acknowledging us.  One time we clearly saw her go over and clean a high top in the bar area when there were wait staff standing around talking that should have done that.  Finally 10 mins later we had another person come over tell us that they wouldn't even consider taking our name without a reservation.

The view of Boston through the highest floor of the Prudential is breathtaking, especially at night. If you have never seen Boston illuminated by the city lights, you need to go. Inside, it was tastefully decorated with nice furnishings. When we went, there was a live jazz band playing and couples would occasionally go to the dance floor to dance while they waited between their courses. Overall, the setting had a very nice romantic feeling to it.\\n\\nFood: All of us had the three course dinner. Everyone loved their food, which was complimented with the two bottles of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc we ordered. The timing between the courses was good - just enough time to allow us to catch up on the view and the stories being told before our next meal arrived. \\n\\nService: Good service. We went there at 10:00pm or so and stayed past their closing time - it must have been around 1:00am when we left. The waiter was patient and realized it was a special night for all of us, and he made sure everything went smoothly. No complaints.\\n\\nPrice: The bill was about $318 including tip.

It's a place that I've always wanted to try, but never got the chance until now.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is intimate and casual, yet upscale with exposed brick walls and modern lighting. They also have a long bar area that seems perfect for those who are dining alone, or just grabbing a quick drink.\\n\\nTheir menu is focused, which I can appreciate. They have 8 appetizers, 3 salads, 3 sandwiches and 7 entrees to choose from. There's enough variety to satisfy most palates, but it's not too overwhelming and you're not flipping through multiple pages. \\n\\nThe Rossi also has an extensive wine list and a handful of craft cocktails. Combining that with a 4-7 PM Happy Hour that gets you $2 domestic beers plus well drinks, makes for a winning formula. \\n\\nMy friend and I shared the \\"Grilled Lamb Lollipops\\" appetizer along with a large Margherita pizza with Italian sausage, roasted garlic and roasted peppers. The lamb appetizer was tasty, with the lamb cooked perfectly and very succulent. However at $14, I thought the portions were a little meager as it came with 3 bite-size pieces.\\n\\nThe true star of the show was their pizza. I had zero expectations about Rossi pizza beforehand, but I was truly wowed when I took my first bite. Their pizza is a thin crust Neapolitan style pizza that holds up surprisingly well with all the toppings. \\n\\nThe flavorful Italian sausage morsels and tangy, juicy roasted Roma tomatoes really elevated the dish. It was also the first time eating seemingly whole garlic cloves. I thought they would be overpowering, but strangely, the garlic flavor was subtle and pleasant. The value is also there, as $15 (for a large basic pie) gets you a good sized (8 slices) pizza that is enough to share between two people. \\n\\nI must agree with other reviewers that the service was just okay. As small as the restaurant is, we still waited awhile for our orders to be placed and also to get our bill. Regardless, the food quality here is solid and I will definitely be back."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I wouldn't stand in-line too long for anything, especially a doughnut, but we went late at night before the bars let out & we were stuffing our faces within 10 minutes, so in this case, totally worth it!

Ford Fry opened this magnificent Fish Camp in the Spring of 2012 to accolades that included Restaurant of the Year and 7th Best New Restaurant in America. After two years, The Optimist (a type of sailing dinghy used for teaching kids) is still sailing strong, impressing both new and return visitors alike.\\n\\nYour experience begins as you dock your car with the friendly and swift valets in front of the restaurant. Valet is now $2, but there is street parking a block away on Marietta and free lots in the Brickworks complex. From there, you walk past large putting greens designed to keep you busy in high traffic times and enter the the building. The restaurant is divided into two main sections: an Oyster Bar that also serves as the reception area and main dining room featuring a separate cocktail bar in the center. You may choose to relax at either of the bars and the friendly hostesses will fetch you when all is ready.\\n\\nThe dining space is reclaimed wood Savannah chic with massive floor to ceiling windows, filament lighting, and coastal themed decor. The open kitchen sits in the rear of the dining room with individual bathrooms down the side of the kitchen space. (and incidentally I love their restrooms: individual doors, white hexagonal tile, pedestal sinks. Gorgeous!)\\n\\nService here is on point and regal without the pretentious feel of fine dining snobbery (black linen also available upon request).\\n\\nWhen seated at the table, they offer an Oyster tasting menu paired with their lunch or dinner menu. If you are price conscious, I cannot recommend the lunch menu enough. Half the cost, all the goodness. We've done numerous lunches here and it is a great way to do The Optimist on a budget. Otherwise, it commands a price commiserate with the quality of the ingredients and preparation of the food. You'll easily spend $30-$50 a person on dinner, but they have a surprisingly affordable cocktail and wine list to match. \\n\\nThe Oyster menu rotates out with the seasons and is split fairly evenly between Atlantic and Pacific options. I'm partial to the wonderful, large oysters of PEI, but you must try some of the Pacific fare as well. Oysters are ~$2-3 a piece and come with in-house saltines, cocktail, shaved horseradish, and vinegar ingredients so you can dress your oysters your way.\\n\\nThe Dinner menu features starters that range from salads to shrimp and octopus, progresses to wood fired seafood mains, and has a separate section for sides that serve 2-3 per dish (We tend to order the sides and share them family style with the meal). I've yet to have anything here short of delectable. The presentation is as beautiful as the meal tastes with everything served in unique pans and ceramics to match the preparation.\\n\\nStandouts:\\n* The Lobster Roll. For $15, you won't find anywhere better in Atlanta short of the late night menu at The Octopus Bar in EAV. Always available at the bar or your table (it is off the main dinner menu, but just ask), a generous amount of claw meat overflows a warm, buttery roll.\\n* Sides: Beignet hush puppies, beets, brussel sprouts, succotash\\n* Mains: the servers are very knowledgeable. The monkfish, octopus, and scallops are some of my go-to favorites\\n\\nThe Optimist, redefining a gourmet seafood experience in landlocked Atlanta!"},{"name":"Stammtisch","address":"401 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped in to get a beer.

And a lot of the fancier looking ones that only taste incrementally better than the rest are on the most expensive blue and black plates. \\n\\nHowever, if you DO decide to go ahead with the happy hour deal, you're paying $2 for hot tea, or $2.50 for soda. Do you even realize what a perfect psychological dilemma this puts us in? Almost everyone will \\"logically\\" decide to go with the happy hour because it means $1.25/$1.75 plates. What a deal! ...Except the added $2.50 tacked on to the end of the bill makes a kind of cheap meal into a regular priced meal.... EXCEPT (again) not even, because the quality of the food is so low. \\n\\nAlso, if you don't eat more than 3-ish plates, the happy hour will end up costing you more than if you'd just gone without it. This whole \\"deal\\" just creates a huge profit margin off the cheapest product- soft drinks and hot tea. This is solely why I Love Sushi is still in business; I guarantee it.

The food was amazing!  I loved every bite and it was incredibly fresh.  People rave about the beet fries and everything they say is true.  \\n\\nNow for why I couldn't give the place 3 stars.  The service was the ruder than Doyle's.  If you have ever been to Doyle's you know you do not go there for service.  I could not believe the way the phone was answered or the way I was no greeted when I went to pick up my food. \\n\\nI called to place my pick up order and the phone rang until someone said, \\"What\\".  I was a bit surprised but got past that and ordered my food.  The order was read back to me and there was a mistake which I corrected.  I think that I was supposed to have just let the mistake go because I was rudely told, \\"OK, fine I got it now\\".\\n\\nWhen I arrived to pick up my food I walked in to find no one else in line to order or pick up so I was figured it would be quick.  There was a woman behind the register who was just staring at me and saying nothing.  Finally after a few strange seconds I said hello.  She again said nothing and continued to stare at me.  I then said I have an order.  Her response, \\" Well I didn't know what you were hear for.  What is your name?\\"  Again rude.  I told her my name she handed me most of my order.  Again must be my mistake but I asked a question because I was missing my milkshake.  She rolled her eyes at me and said, \\"I know you have one it is in the freezer I thought you wouldn't want it to melt.\\"  She turned around and yelled into the kitchen at some poor woman who went and got my milkshake.  i handed the milkshake and then again stared at.  I gave my credit card to her and she rang me up with not a word.  She tore of the receipt like I had pissed her off by even buying food and shoved it across the counter at me. I signed it with her staring at me the entire time.  I handed her the copy of the receipt and said thank you.  She still said nothing.  I could no longer resist so I told her that if she wasn't so rude I would have put a tip in the tip jar and that she should probably get some manners if she was going to answer phones and work a counter at a restaurant.  She said, \\"whatever\\" and started at me until i started to walk out the door.  Before I left I made a point of thanking the woman who had gotten my milkshake because she did not deserve to be yelled at.  \\n\\nSo Grass Fed if you want to keep customers I suggest you teach your staff how to answer phones, greet customers, and interact with them when they come to pick up food.

The chips were my favorite item of the day. I would have no issue ordering them as a brunch entree. I don't care for lox, but these chips featured a warm shredded salmon that had been perfectly smoked. The elements of this starter came together in a fantastic execution. I am craving more. Dessert, a chocolate cake which was split between several guests, was decadent and also crave-worthy. \\n\\nThe rest of brunch was very good, but nothing knocked my socks off. The lobster benedict featured a rather bland hollandaise, and while it was loaded with lobster meat, the only flavor that really jumped on the tongue was butter from the English muffin.  If i am going to splurge on an item like lobster benedict, I expect it to dazzle. The breakfast potatoes were crispy and a touch spicy. Again, they were very good, but not too memorable. I tried a bite of gouda grits, which were very yummy.  Their creaminess rivaled that of Flying Biscuit's grits. Drinks (two of their fruit infusions) were good, and the vodka infusion was particularly potent. \\n\\nI would like to try Two Urban Licks for dinner, especially since I hear that that salmon chips are on that menu as well!"},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Nice seating area, lots of deserts.

I came at 12:30pm and had to wait a little bit for the rush to subside before I got a seat. What I found amazing about Pho Goodness is that once you order your items you most likely will get your food within 5-10 minutes. The turn around time for your food to get to your table is amazing! But despite the fast turn around time, I wasn't that satisfied with the fact that there is only one size for all noodles on the menu. Each item was closing in at 8 to 9 dollars, putting your lunch meal at around 10 something. I really wanted to like Pho Goodness, if not only because the restaurant was so clean and the turn around time was fast, but I have a feeling that my carnivore eating friends may not be too keen with the amount of meat in their noodles. I ordered the #20 House special beef pho which is your typical all-in meat pho but was surprised by how little of meat you get in comparison to noodles. I'm not a big meat eater when it comes to pho so the portion was just right for me, but I have a feeling those that are use to the normal huge meat portions from other pho restaurants may not be too happy about this.

My significant other and I have been there a number of times, and have usually left generally satisfied.  This time, however, was a horrible exception.\\n\\nApparently, they have changed their menu.  I suspect they have also changed their cooks, because the artichoke is absolutely disgusting.  It is a dried plant leaf served with cold butter.  It is not edible.  The ceviche was soaking in lime juice to the point that it was all you could taste.  Needless to say, the ten dollar price tag for each of these appetizers made them even less worthwhile.\\n\\nThe cocktails seem to be hastily thrown together, the black and blue just tastes like vodka, and the castaway like rum.  If I wanted a glass of rum, I would have ordered it, but a cocktail needs some care put into it.\\n\\nIt will be quite some time before I decide to return to Two Urban Licks.

No big. Prices were absolutely reasonable, which surprised me (some of the giant, elaborate things were $2-$4 each, many were in the $1-$2 range). For people complaining about the price, I think they don't recognize that you're not coming here to buy your standard plain dozen for your family visiting from out of town- you're ordering a specialty breakfast, so no, a dozen donuts will not be 10 bucks.\\n\\nOne caveat- just as we stepped up to greet the cashier, a woman from outside shoves through the line to ask the cashier \\"a quick question\\". She steps in front of us and spends, literally, 5 solid minutes asking him questions that sum up to the greater inquiry of \\"how do I not have to wait in line in the future\\". He was very polite to her, and very apologetic to us after she left, but once it became clear she wasn't just asking for a napkin or something, I would preferred if he'd been a little more forthright and asked her to stand aside while he helped people in line, or asked another staffer behind him to assist her. He was a nice kid though, not a huge deal.\\n\\nAnd, of course, the donuts. They were quite tasty (bacon maple, blueberry cake, lemon creuller, some over-the-top peanut butter chocolate syrup explosion), but nothing I felt compelled to eat..

It would have been understandable if the restaurant was busy - however, this was not the case...most of the tables were empty. \\nWhen the bread waiter came around with the bread basket, he dropped my piece of bread loudly on the bread plate and crumbs went everywhere. I had expected him to say sorry because it seemed like a mistake. However, he just walked away - I guess it was normal for him. \\n\\nFood: The dishes were sloppily plated as my soup bowl was not wiped down - this may be a personal pet peeve, but it just shows that the chef does not care enough to simply take only 3 seconds to have presentable food. \\n\\nFor my entree, I got the ribs which were overly dry and really tough. My friend's pasta dish seemed like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while as the top of the pasta was a darker colour compared to the rest of the dish. Both of our dishes were not warm enough - her pasta had the kind of oil droplets that form when food is not warm enough and has been siting there for a while.\\n\\nMy dessert (chocolate cake) tasted good - until i bit into the plastic wrap. I thought it was just 1 piece and did not feel like sending it back to the kitchen. However, I took another bite and bit into another piece of plastic. When I informed my waiter, he simply took it back to the kitchen and came back a few minutes later with a new cake and an insincere one line apology \\"Sorry about that\\". \\n\\nWe felt very rushed by the waiter as he placed the bill on our table shortly after we got our desserts. This was absolutely no reason for him to do so as the restaurant was not busy.\\n\\nIn between the courses, the table was cleared hastily and loudly.

However, this should not have affected their service and food quality simply because they are serving a less expensive menu. \\n\\nThe group consensus was that we would not return nor recommend the restaurant to anyone.

I will start by raving about their hospitality, knowledge, anticipation, accommodation and thoughtfulness when it involves dining out with little ones... and then we'll get to food!\\n\\nMy friend and her 2 1/2 year old were visiting this weekend, and we went there for pizza. We hadn't even passed by the bar and they graciously offered a spot for her stroller to be stored while we ate. It was just a very quick, very hospitable gesture to happen, rather than trying to stuff it by a table or leave it outside. When we were seated, they offered to store our coats and scarves and excess bags. We happily accepted. They brought the kiddo a sippy-cup with water, a kid-safe version. Granted, he still managed to spill it because he's clever like that, but he didn't fuss about it, and someone appeared within milliseconds with cloth towels (instead of paper/napkins), and a new cup. There was no sighing or eye rolling about children/their hazards as might have been experienced at other places. They just rolled with it.\\n\\nWe went up to the pizza oven area to let the kiddo see how the pizza dough was kneaded, tossed, spread out and covered with deliciousness before going into the oven. He was THRILLED when they brought him kid-sized dough portions to play with at the table!! We had told him that the oven came from Naples (\\"Naaaapoliiii\\" - as said in a 2 1/2 year old's voice) and he wanted to ask the waiter 'why' it was from there. Our waiter obliged with the story of Vesuvius and the resulting volcanic stone and soil being very beneficial for pizza making. When we were signing the bill, our coats just appeared - out of nowhere! - and we were on our way. It was great to see people at Locale really on top of their game. On a MONDAY. I love bringing out of towners there and I will continue to do so because they really get what hospitality and customer service and 'host'ing means. I have never been disappointed there. EVER. This just seemed like everything they did that afternoon was above and beyond their normal and wonderful way of working, and we both really appreciated the attention to detail when it came to the kiddo.\\n\\nNow... the food!\\n\\nI LOVE their arancini - melted cheese tucked inside a saffron risotto ball and then fried with until perfectly crunchy and crisp (not overly breaded or goopey). I could eat a plate of them if I didn't want to save room for the rest of the food! My friend agreed- little bite-sized pieces of deliciousness and just the right amount of salt. YUM.\\n\\nShe had the arugula salad - basic, fresh, and enough to whet the appetite. I had the mercato - this time of year, apples, radish, spinach, mustard vinaigrette and very satisfying for a pizza precursor.\\n\\nBut who are we kidding... we came for the pizza! She (and the kiddo) had the margherita (sauce, cheese, basil) and I had the maiz - corn, prosciutto and it's just as good as the other times I've been. They do 'personal' sized pizzas, and the crust is char-cooked in the oven but it's still delightfully stretchy (in a good way!) and thin compared to say, a NY or Chicago-style slice or pie. They also have the pizzas come out whole, so you do cut them yourself at the table. \\n\\nWe finished with the butterscotch budino (pudding) -- which I haven't had before, and OH MY GOODNESS I might have to order again! Ladies next to us had ordered it and we eyeballed it when they were served - wonderful layers of creamy, custardy caramel, really smooth and delicate, and.... just get one and then have it come with extra spoons - it's meant for sharing!

The menus are at the far end of the space, next to the register, and the bench for contemplating about the menu is back at the exit. If you don't go to the bench, you crowd the already narrow ordering space. My husband and I went to place the order and had to wait about 5 minutes for the head chef/baker and a cashier to stop chatting. We finally make the order and head back to the table to wait for a pizza and two appetizers. Food arrived quickly enough, but it was very disappointing. The bread was rubbery, zero crunch in the crust, and so was the pizza. Neapolitan? Not really. The pizza was actually kinda cold and tasted like a warmed up pizza. We initially couldn't even eat at all as we had no silverware for our appetizers (salad and meatballs). I asked a water/host/explainer (still unsure what they are) for silverware and napkins and he looked at me like I asked him for his kidney. Apparently, you don't need a fork to eat a salad at MidiCi.

I went to the location near Oak Hill. After waiting a while for carry out because the online ordering system was down, I was still pretty excited to try this pizza everyone has been raving about. I am an Italian, who grew up eating pizza all over the country, including Little Italy in NY and deep dish in Chicago. So I finally try it and it's a NOPE. The sauce on this pizza was honestly on the bland side and didn't taste above Domino's. There also wasn't enough of it on the pizza. I expected some sort of equal distribution of sauce, but there wasn't more than the size of a teaspoon directly in the middle of each of my pizza slices. Not to mention that a $25 dollar pizza that allegedly feeds 3-4 people should have been big enough to equal more than 1 or 2 pieces per person. That pizza barely fed 3 people and we got a salad on the side. If there had been a 4th person, someone would have only been able to eat a single pizza slice. Who eats a single slice of pizza?!?!?! I really wasn't impressed with the pizza and won't be going back for those prices points. DiGiorno makes a tastier pizza. It simply isn't worth it. Jett's pizza is seriously a much better square pizza and is also much less expensive. Of course, you might not run into any dude bruh hip scenesters at Jett's because it's not the latest fad Austin eatery, but you will enjoy a really delicious square pizza for literally almost half the price."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped in for a couple of slices and a local beer while exploring South Congress.

But along with that, it's also kinda expensive for what your getting. I came here a lot my first 2 years in college, but when I moved about 200 yards farther away (and got a car), i stopped coming as much. \\n\\nIronically, in my opinion the pizza is the weakest thing on their menu. I've had their pizza, calzone and wings. I can easily say that the pizza is unremarkable, a regular oven fired pizzeria pizza. Nothing that will really blow your mind, and with all the other choices around it (Antico's for Neapolitan and Fellini's and Maddio's as well), in my opinion, the pizza here is kinda outclassed compared to those other joints. \\n\\nHowever, what you should get here are the calzones, which are simply massive; I can barely polish one off by myself, it could probably be shared between 2 people with average to above average appetites. Also, despite its size, it is simply filled to capacity with whatever toppings you get with it. \\n\\nThe wings here are a winner too. I think they're probably the best wings withing walking distance of Georgia Tech. No if's and's or but's. It simply blows JR Cricket, Taco Mac or Junior's out of the water. Big, juicy, full of flavor, and very moist. Just awesome. If I didn't have a car, or Jamal's Wings didn't exist, I would just come here instead. \\n\\nSo the wrap up, above average food with respect to the calzone and the wings. But the pizza lets it down, and the prices here are kinda steep. Expect to spend 10 dollar if you dine in and get water. More if you get an entree w/ an app. Oh, and you can do hooka here if thats your thing (it's not mine).

First, the restaurant is almost 200 years old. How cool is that? Second, sit in the bar (you'll be seated immediately instead of waiting in a long line)  and expose yourself to the bizarre and wonderful clientele, which are a strange mix of tourists and crusty locals.

Come to think of it, I may just do that the next time I go to Bollywood Bites.  Also, there was a dessert made of grated carrots that I may have never had the guts to try, but since everything else was so good, I gave it a shot.  It was like nothing else I had ever eaten: a different texture, and a little sweetness.  So, if you want your kid to eat carrots, find out how to make this dish, cause it was yummy.

It was disappointing to the two whose birthdays it was.\\n\\nIn addition, when we asked them to cut the pizza for us, we were told, quite condescendingly, that they do not precut the pizzas in Italy, and the table knives were 'specially designed' to cut the pizza. I've been to Italy and eaten the pizza across many regions of the country. I never had trouble cutting the pizzas in Italy that were not sliced (and some places did pre-slice, so it's not unheard of), but here, the pizza turned into a huge mess. Part of the problem was that the toppings needed to be cut smaller, because those knives will simply not slice most of those toppings.  Maybe I also had different types of knives in Italy, I don't know. What I do know is that it was difficult and was a huge mess. Also, the fact is, if your customer asks for something as simple as slicing the pizza, it's simply good service to do it, rather than argue with them and treat them like they're idiots. \\n\\nFinally, to add insult to injury, the pizza just wasn't that elevated. The flavor balance was completely off on every one of the 3 pizzas we tried. Crust did have good texture, though it was slightly over salted (and I like salted crust).\\n\\nIn short, this place just wasn't worth it.

They have good vegetarian options too.  We couldn't help ourselves, so between the 2 of us, we ordered 6 dishes.  \\n\\n1. Tofu Zha Jiang Mian - the noodle itself is good. The peanuts has good aroma and texture. The tofu is nice, but the flavor was disappointing. Very salty. All I tasted was salt. I didn't taste any of the \\"fried sauce\\" aroma.  There's no sweetness to the sauce. There's no balance of flavor. \\n\\n2. Mushroom Baozi - There's a lot of filling, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. There's no flavor, no aroma. The worst part is the skin. It was tough to chew. The only time I've ever had baozi skin that taste like that was when I made baozi and messed it up or left it sitting out too long. The skin only partially rise. I saw other people's baozi and they seemed to have risen to a nice and fluffy consistency. Not sure what happened with mine. The sauce was ok. \\n\\n3. Saut√©ed Chinese greens. Pretty simple and it's good as expected. I love veggies and wanted to eat this with my noodles. This didn't work out as planned because the kitchen forgot to make this dish for us. It came out a while after we asked- by that time my noodles already got cold. \\n\\nHusband ordered Xiao Long Bao, which he said didn't have any flavor.  He also got the beef ho fun and shianghai pork & shrimp noodles. He said they're just ok. Pretty small noodle serving. \\n\\n- Service: very fast and friendly. However, they somehow forgot 2 of our dishes.  \\n- Food: less than average. I love this kind of food and the location is so convenient, but there's nothing here I'd want to eat again. \\n- Price: we paid $56+ tip for what I consider fast food and we weren't full.  You do the math. Granted, hand made XLB and baozi are labor intensive (there were 14 people working there when we went). However, the noodles are not labor intensive and they kinda skimp on the serving size. I'd rather pay a little more and get a bigger serving. \\n\\nI was ready to love this place.

The location is very small, with a half dozen tables and a bar going along the entire store front, and pretty much bare walls and a strategically old ceiling.  Overall, it has a great, old world feel that reminds me of cafes and cerveceria's I used to go to in Italy and Spain (a decor I'm sure that they were shooting for).  \\n\\nThe pizza is cooked in a traditional oven behind the bar, another nice touch to the decor.  Pizza is the focus of the menu, and cost around $15 per pizza and they are fairly small... they seem too big for a typical person, but not big enough for two... the modern dilemma.  I ate and entire one today for lunch with a glass of wine, but am feeling it now.  Most people were walking out with 1/4 of the pizza to go (like a piece or so).  In terms of the pizza, I had a margarita pizza.  The crust was amazing, but it could have used more ingredients on top, and the basil was overwhelming, monopolizing the flavor from the buffalo mozzarella and sauce.  I've had similar artisan pizzas, which isn't far off from the traditional way of cooking pizza in Italy, but I still prefer places like Pieus and Due Forne, which tend to have a bit more ingredients but keep with the style.

We split a Perella, which had goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, basil, prosciutto, parmesan and a bunch of yummy stuff. The ingredients were fresh (and locally sourced), the wood-fired oven left a nice char, and the crust was thin, crispy, and flavorful.

CostCo members get 10% off - especially nice if you are hitting CostCo and Tre'za in one trip as we did.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\nDespite this being one of the first locations, this is a quick-casual franchise chain in all of the worst ways.  The atmosphere is generic and bland, you order at the counter, and there is nothing local or trendy feeling about it at all.  Several of the walls were bare and looked unfinished, but I assume this is just because they are new and will be fixed.\\n\\nThe salads were ridiculously priced at $10-12.  We wanted to split a pizza and salad, but even if you get the small portion and knock $3 off the price, it's too expensive. Learn from Fellini's and other pizza places and offer a cheaper side salad (or any cheaper sides - yep, they don't have any other sides)\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIt's too bad the atmosphere is so generic and \\"chain-y\\" - keeping me from giving this place 5 stars.

I think they are probably losing business during lunch hours because it does fill up fast and people on a time crunch don't have time to look for parking and or wait in long lines. I know that's why I could never come here during lunch.\\n\\nThe prices are reasonable. I think slightly pricy but for the flavor and options it is a better choice than other burger joints. \\n\\nI do like that Perla and Fat Matt's are right next to this place.

Service was extremely slow, and it took us almost 2 1/2 hours to eat dinner even though we ordered very promptly.  It took 55 minutes to get our entr√©es. I had the duck with french fries. It was a very strange meal-a quarter of a duck on a small plate covered with a mound of soggy french fries that kept falling off the plate as I ate. I eat duck quite frequently, and this one was not well prepared. It was tough and flavorless, except for the sweet sherry sauce that added little to the entr√©e. For a leg and thigh of duck, with a mound of french fries, at $30, I expected better quality and taste. Additionally, I mentioned to the server that it was my dinner companion's birthday, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears. There was no candle in her dessert, no recognition of the special occasion at all.  I have to say that had Ford Fry dined with me this evening, he too would have been disappointed.

It was on Valentine's Day so I was surprised to find it only about half full. The seating is a little confusing, but it seems that one side is for adults only while the other smaller side is for \\"families\\". We were seated in that section, where only two other tables were occupied. The waitress was very attentive, at first. So within just a few minutes of arriving, we had drinks and made our order. One large, simple pepperoni pizza, and a personal size Canadian bacon with Alfredo sauce pizza. Then, the waiting commenced...about an hour later, we finally had our pizza, which we had to have boxed up, as we were now going to be late to our movie if we stayed. We were starving though, and as we waited for the check and change, we were scarfing down hurried bites of our pizzas, which were pretty good.\\n\\nI do not know what happened. I didn't ask for a specific explanation but our server didn't offer one either. At one point, after about a half hour, she did come to the table and say, \\"Well, we have the small pizza but not the larger one. It's going to be about another 16 minutes before that one is finished.\\" I just looked at her, waiting to hear why it was taking so long. They weren't that busy, and others seemed to be getting their pizzas in a timely fashion. She didn't apologize at that time, though she did later. I should note that it was her first time back to our table since dropping off our drinks, which were now empty. As she turned to walk away, both my daughter and I said,\\"May we get refills?\\" I was by this point, frustrated with her level of service. Finally, about 20 minutes later, she stopped by the table to let us know it was almost ready. I asked her to box them at that point. Our glasses were empty again and she failed to notice that yet again. Our pizzas arrived a few minutes later, I paid, and we left. On our way to the car, my daughter apologized for asking me to take them there and noted she'd never come back despite liking the pizza. \\n\\nMy kid is the least picky of my family about service, so if she thought it was bad, it was bad. She told me not to leave a tip, which she NEVER does. I was surprised. I did tip though, because I didn't know if it was her mistake, the kitchen's, that they were overly busy with takeout orders, or what. She eventually did apologize and did not charge me for the large pizza. Overall though, our experience was pretty poor, thus the 2 stars.

Although 1/2 hour later, it started to fill up. We received attentive service the first half of our dinner but as the restaurant got busier, the servers seemed to be struggling.

Nevertheless, I do believe that they made a tremendous effort in trying to please all of their patrons. \\"A\\" for effort! \\n\\nThe server was very knowledgeable about all the menu items and made excellent suggestions. I really appreciated her enthusiasm in describing the food and drink offerings. \\n\\nFor a party of 4 we ended up ordering 6 dishes (to share, of course). \\n\\nHonorable mentions: \\n\\nThe \\"rau ram\\" ($7.00) - green papaya salad with orange zest, shredded green apple, peanuts, and crispy shallots was excellent... refreshing and just the right ingredient proportions. \\n\\nThe \\"chay curry with prawns\\" ($14.00) - was over flowing with a variety of veggies, taro and tofu. \\n\\nDessert - deep-fried bananas drizzled with condensed milk and served with lychee ice cream .... to die for! .... a must try! \\n\\nCHAU markets itself as a modern Vietnamese restaurant and that is exactly what it is. Regular Vietnamese fare in a modern setting; beautifully plated meals; fancy cocktails; full service. \\n\\nThat being said, the pricing is a bit steep for what you get.

What?! This had to be made up! But Wikipedia and Google promptly confirmed that indeed, Chick Fil-A has its origins in this so-called \\"Dwarf House\\" in Hapeville, Georgia. The Dwarf House is still a full service diner open 24/6 - like all Chick Fil-A restaurants, closed on Sundays. And everything I see on the internet about this place indicates to me that I ABSOLUTELY MUST GO.\\n\\nI did this morning - it's about a mile off of 75 south of the city. From the front, the little red dwarf door looked sort of like it was locked, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not. My friend and I walked through it with glee. We pointed and giggled at the moving wall display of seven dwarfs exiting their house and trotting off to the mines. We looked at the photographs of the Dwarf House through the years. We read the story of its founding in the captions. \\n\\nMy friend and I seemed to be the only ones delighting in the dwarfiness, however. The rest of the clientele appeared to be regulars or locals for whom any dwarf-related novelty had long since worn off. They also seemed to leer at us, though my friend noticed this more than I did. \\n\\nAside from the splashes of German cottage decor, the place looks like the love child of a Chick Fil-A and a down-home diner. It's full service, with booths, barstools, and an overhead dimly illuminated menu with plastic removable lettering. But the colors are decidedly Chick Fil-A, and the place still displays those abhorrent advertisements involving cows that know how to write, but not spell. These cow advertisements, by the way, are my least favorite major advertising campaign that has lasted more than a year, EVER. But don't get me started on that. \\n\\nWe immediately took our seats at a not-yet wiped down booth, the only one available at 10:14 on a Saturday morning. I was a bit antsy because the menu said that they were going to stop serving biscuits at 10:30. A busboy came by first to clear the previous occupants' dishes. A few minutes later, someone came to take our drink orders. After asking for water, I warned this person that I fully intended to order a biscuit, and she said that would not be a problem. In fact, she said I had forty minutes left, so perhaps the menu is incorrect as to the no more biscuit time? I didn't care, as long as I got mine. \\n\\nI ordered an egg and cheese biscuit, and hash browns with cheese and onions. The hash browns came out first, and without the onions. The biscuit came out seconds later. My friend ordered the chick fil-a chicken breakfast, which consists of two biscuits, grits, eggs any style, and a boneless piece of battered chicken. The wait time was only minutes. I am not shy about grease, and the food was delightful. The biscuit was slightly crumbly but very moist - Chick Fil-a does biscuits a little differently, and not everyone likes them. I happen to love them. The scrambled egg was not quite as processed and perfectly squared as it is when it comes from a fast-food joint. The cheese was, of course, an American cheese single. Mmmmmm. The hash browns were crispy, all golden brown and dripping in oil, just how I like them. \\n\\nAfter paying our bill of $11, we exited through the little door again. I stopped to play with the round door knocker on the other side, knocking several times. No answer. I did not have the opportunity to try either a fried apple pie or the \\"ice box pie\\" in lemon, chocolate, or coconut. But that's next on my list. \\n\\nSo Chick Fil-A managed to trick me into feeling like I went to this cute local diner for breakfast today, when really I just patronized another fast food giant. Nonetheless, I am definitely going back to Dwarf House at every available opportunity."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Yasss!

For this review, I am fixated on my dining room experience. This venue is divided into two sections (Dining area and casual area). Menu for both area are different which adds to their diversity of selections. I recommend a minimum of two visits to experience both. \\n\\nAn establishment like the Optimist thrives on providing extraordinary service to multiply the adventure of dining that you already get from their wide selections of seafood preferences (Great for seafood lovers).  OYSTERS - To have a generous range of selections of oysters is stimulating to my relish appetite and this privilege is not easy to come by within Atlanta combined with fine quality (I'm referring to seafood - It's FRESH). I recommend any deep-sea oysters (Lucky Limes and Kumamoto are two of my favorites). \\n\\nAny time I see arugula salad on the menu, it's a no brainer. I am surprised that I do run into people who had never had arugula O_o (Arugula consist of many variation of flavors between sweet and spicy - for those who might be curious). If you are one of those who never had it, get it! The arugula salad is a fine selection to begin your meal.\\n\\nSelecting my main entre, I was leaning towards the snapper but when I saw GRUNT on the menu, I was intrigued by the name. I had to inquire about this fish labeled GRUNT! I understand describing a type of fish is a difficult task for anyone. My server had proficiently explained the type of texture, made comparisons and described the preparation of the grunt fish. Of course, I made my selection to the grunt fish and let me simplify it.... It was meaty (Like a tuna steak).

Over the top!\\n\\nI hosted my wife's birthday party here in early December 2014.  We reserved the back room for a cocktail hour and then a sit down dinner.  First the actual room  has a great atmosphere with modern decor (all of the guest kept commenting on how cool the room was).  The service was great.  We had 2 servers waiting on our party (about 20 people).  No one was ever waiting on drinks and they kept track of tabs better than imagined (impressed at how well they remembered people's names).  The food was also great.  I ordered appetizers, which the guest raved about.  For the main course, I had the Camel Bolognese and my wife had the Sea Bass, both were top quality.  All our guests seems very pleased with the appetizers and dinner.\\n\\nWith all that, De Novo is a 5 star place, but what put them over the top is when I wanted to show a short video.  They had a large TV mounted on the wall.  Partially my fault for not checking the TV inputs prior to the date of the party, when we arrived at the party, we realized that I couldn't hook my computer up to the TV to show the video.  The manager, Matt, went and brought his personal TV to the restaurant for us to use. WHAT?!?!

Maybe too much under my belt but I did need to try more things.\\n\\nTonight was the Quinoa Crunch Bowl with chicken for me though I did taste quite a bit off my husband's  plates too. He started with the seasonal kale chicken soup and found it too spicy to finish so I took over. It was spicy with a lot of red chili flakes but if you could avoid a whole spoon of them, the remainder was about right. A little light on the kale but some good potato chunks for balance. He also got the cucumber mint Lyfe water which was huge and we both liked it. I had a nice pot of hot tea as a cold meal on a cool night is a bit much for me. \\n\\nMy bowl included a quinoa tabouleh, edamame hummus, avocado, arugula, cherry tomatoes  and radishes. The radishes could have been cut a bit smaller in the kitchen as the dinner knife wasn't ideal to make the pieces easy to eat. The chicken breast was nicely flavored and very tender and cut into pieces way smaller than the radish. The whole thing was sprinkled with hot sauce, fine for me but not everyone (like my husband.) He had the chicken avocado sandwich which suited him quite well.\\n\\nWe both had a budino for dessert. He had the chocolate with pomegranate chia which I had last time and he loved it as much as I did. I had the pumpkin which sounded better than the execution. I love pumpkin and that part was good and not over spiced. However, they sat it on a bed of the coconut milk chia that they use for the banana budino and and I don't think it works with pumpkin, at least not for me. The spoonfuls from the bottom, once the pumpkin was gone, were just too coconut-y for me and I was forced to get something else to cut the aftertaste, once we left Lyfe. Two of my favorite places are on the next block - to the rescue!\\n\\nThis Lyfe is a bit confusing compared to Park Meadows where you enter immediately into the ordering line. Here, you must cross past the seating area and the takeout registers to get to the order line. You pay, then sit and they bring you the food. But not the silverware, which is apparently past the other seating area to the left. So go get it before sitting down. They do clear the tables at the end though, but maybe a bit too quickly if you are dawdling over dessert and a drink. Pricing is really pretty high for quick casual even if unique quality food. There does seem to be a lot of overlap on the seasonings from the plates I have tried, so I will see how this plays out long term.

As a person who does their research before trying any new restaurant, I read almost all of the reviews right here on Zomato, and most of the rave was centered around their salmon chips, which I thought were good, but not great. The empanadas? Delicious. They have a side of sweet corn that somehow one of my friend's ordered, but wasnt on the menu. That was really good too. Also, I remember reading a review saying that because the kitchen is in the center of the restaurant, you leave not smelling very well. It's true, I left smelling terrible! Lol!! I immediately threw my clothes in the wash, all the while, thinking of that reviewer. So if its possible for you to score a seat farther from the center of the restaurant, great. Of course it gets pretty hot sitting near the kitchen. I guess if you dont mind your clothes smelling, it works out during the cold months, but during the summer? We were using our menus to fan ourselves, and once those were taken away, whatever could be found in the purse to fan with. The customer service was great.

My husbands piece was smaller than mine. Three bites and it was gone!! For $17 incl one side this was not much of a value.  I also remember ordering (from my visit in June) the hand cut French fries which were freshly cut and awesome. Not the case this time just your basic 'out of the freezer into the fryer' type of fries.  While our portions were small another person at our table ordered the Catfish which was a huge piece of fish. What's going on with this place?? Cutting back on the food is not the way to go.

How does that happen? My husband's steak was ordered medium rare but it came to the table blue (or raw) to where you couldn't even cut into it or chew it unless you were a horse. The server actually wanted to take the steak back and recook the cut up pieces. Who does that? You either offer to remake the steak from scratch or offer the customer something else, which he did, but my husband was so peppered that he declined. Everything in this restaurant is smoked when it's prepared. I didn't taste anything smoky in my duck. The roasted eggplant was a bit undercooked and the smokiness made the eggplant taste fishy. The cut up potatoes salad was tasty. The peaches and pork belly did not wow me. I felt that all the food was grossly under seasoned. The tables are so close together that when the server was taking our order, he kept sticking his butt on my husband's right side bumping him and keeping him from using his right arm to eat.

We ate dinner at 9, and had to wait at the bar for a while for our table...hence, we drank cocktails...hence, the food tasted better.  Such is life.  By the time we left, everyone around us was a wealthy, overdressed, largely European, uber-drunk mess.  Our waiter was really nice, a class act.  We were by the window facing northwest...beautiful view.  It is so delightful to watch the complete mess down by Fenway after the evening games let out.

Can't beat that!\\n\\n-Wine flight: 6 wines for $10. \\n     -Chardonnay:slightly buttery and refreshing.\\n     -Riesling: light, sweet, and fruity. \\n     -White Rabbit: mild and crisp.\\n     -Black Rabbit: a medium bodied red, it was balanced; not overly bitter or sweet, but rather smooth.\\n     -Syrah: The richest out of the flight of 6, very dark.\\n     -Pinot Noir: their \\"most delicate red\\".\\n\\n-Ruby (beer): sweet at first (they press fresh raspberries to flavor; it's on the menu) and a yeasty aftertaste. Very drinkable.\\n\\n-Monkey Punch (cocktail): very sweet, good for those who like to drink cocktails that don't taste strongly alcoholic.\\n\\n-Bourbon Stone Door (cocktail): a strong whiskey drink, but very sweet; it's kind of spicy and tastes of cinnamon.\\n\\n-Edgefield Hard Cider: surprisingly light and bubbly.\\n\\nDinner menu:\\n-Hammerhead Barbecue Pork Sandwich: house-smoked pork shoulder, hammerhead BBQ sauce, buttermilk coleslaw on a housemade brioche.

I get the extravagant topics on top are meant to look more appeling and fun or whatever I just cannot understand why donuts are already festive and happy! It just feels like they just decided to put all kinds of cereals and other sweet things (cookie crumbs gum) on top  of the donuts and to be honest they look straight up grotesque and don't even make any sense or taste good. I guess I took it off my list of things to do in Portland. I just have a feeling that this is basically a tourist trap I just don't see anybody from the area shopping at this donut shop.

Everything from the decor, the wine and beer list and food will take you straight to a french bistro. \\n\\nI have been there a few times and it has been hit or miss each time. Some times the service is amazing...other times like my last visit the service is off. Sometimes the food is fabulous other times its nothing above average. \\n\\nThings started off with a serving of onion soup which was less than amazing... it had no real flavor and was too watery, not enough salt and not enough cheese on top. But to make up for the soup was the delicious warm bread, butter and chicken pate paste which was served as a starter. I didn't touch the soup and instead went straight for the bread. For those who know me well it just goes to show how tasteless it really was because I rarely   pass up food. \\n\\nOn a brighter note, for our main dish I ordered the 'steak onglet and fries' and my friend ordered the moules-frites. The steak was great (although a bit chewy) but I guess that is really dependent on the type of meat served rather than anything else. I LOVED the mushroom sauce and the fries were really good.

My main problem with this place is their social media and marketing. I think I saw they had developed a website, but it appears Facebook is their main form of communication and it's hard to navigate when you want to know what's offered at HVS.

My partner and I sat inside and the atmosphere was very pleasant though a tad on the noisy side. I like that there are private tables and then some larger tables where different parties can sit together. Usually we sit in the outside area out back which is just lovely--probably one of the nicest outdoor seating areas in town--but today it was too hot. I highly recommend this place. Great for a date, and definitely on the affordable side of things. Plus, it's in a hip part of east Austin and surrounded by some interesting scenery.

There's a reason.\\n\\nTo enjoy this restaurant, you need a few key factors in place.\\n\\nFirst, you must be a) a parent, b) someone who adores children no matter whose they are or c) deaf.  This restaurant's raison d'√™tre is children, and  the owners make no bones about this.  This is exactly why their restaurant exists.   Thus, at least 85% of the parties appear with kids of one age or another.  If you can't tolerate a random kid showing up at your table and asking if you can hold onto their crayons / sippy cup / little brother, don't bother.  Honestly.\\n\\nSecondly, you must also be of a certain demographic.  You have to enjoy food for its own sake, but be willing to accept a few compromises.   You have to accept that the menu changes often.  And you have to be relaxed.  The service is prompt and efficient, but the menu is maybe twelve or fifteen dishes at most, the wine and beer selection is very scanty, and generally, people don't linger more than an hour.\\n\\nLastly, you have to really hate what your children eat at Friendly's, but accept that they don't eat Grown-Up food.  Their children's food selection is awesome if you are on this level: yes, the kids get macaroni and cheese, but it's not neon orange.  Sippy cups are available for harried parents who forgot it in the car.  Plates are served with fruit, not fries.  But there isn't any steak on the children's menu, either.  So it's a wonderful compromise between food that kids tend to go for unabashedly (Friendly's / low-end pizzeria / McDonald's) and the restaurant where adults can eat dinner as well.\\n\\nIf you have all these factors in place, it's beyond wonderful.  Every table has a paper tablecloth and crayons next to a jar of utensils.  (This may seem odd to some, but once you've watched how frequently a small child drops a fork on the floor, you appreciate the thoughtfulness of not having to find a waitress to get another fork.)  The tables are ranged throughout the restaurant, from next to the children's play area (where the staff tend to seat families with toddlers, so at least the parents can sit while keeping the kids in their line of sight) to all the way on the opposite side of the entryway.  (Ask for one of these tables in the small section to the left of the entrance if you are eating without children, as the kids tend to be caught by their parents before they get to you.)  The children's play area is stocked liberally with storybooks of all levels, a Brio train set, a play kitchen, Viking helmets and Bob the Builder helmets, Breyer horses and Legos.  The bathrooms are directly off of the children's play area, for obvious reasons.  There's an area to sit in there should you have a particularly young child.\\n\\nBut the idea and theme behind all this is amazing.  It allows parents to let their children play instead of wriggling under the table in boredom.  The children play happily until their food comes, and then scamper back to the play area.  The parents are then free to keep half an eye and half an ear trained to their children, but then actually converse with the others at the table when the children are playing peaceably and then perform an Intervention when they start bickering.  The idea, for the parent of a young child, of eating for ten consecutive minutes without being interrupted is beyond amazing.  The children that come in *tend* to be well behaved, but that of course is no guarantee.  But because the tendency is to the well-behaved kids, it means that usually, your children have built-in playmates to play pretend or trains or dress-up with so that you can finish a meal without a preschooler on your lap, offering helpful commentary on every conversation.\\n\\nBut yes.  Like all speciality businesses, it is not meant to cater to the mainstream.  It is simply a commutation for we parents of being sentenced to twelve years of meals at Burger King or Chuck E. Cheese, and for that, we are incredibly grateful.\\n\\nGroups of up to about 10 should be fine.  Larger may be a problem.  They don't do take-away as most think of it, but they will pack an order to go, as I've asked several times for a family member who was working late or ill at home or some such."},{"name":"Rossi Bar And Kitchen","address":"895 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"so tonight my and my fiance decided to check out the infamous \\"Rossi\\". We wanted to try something new and delicious and were looking for something lite like a good soup and salad dinner. We step inside and are greeted by a younger man in snowboots that obviously seemed to be questioning his sexuality. This was off putting from the start because me and my extremly handsome fiance are very comfortable with our homosexuality and we feel we should show the world. I mean come on mr waiter this is the short north. Moving along we are seated near the window it was cold by the window I even recall my fiance saying something about leaving his gloves throughout the entire dinner. Not the kind of comfort you expect from \\"fine\\" dining. Our blonde waitress came to us after about ten min of waiting breezy cold waiting and asked us if we wanted something to drink and handed us an array of menus three or four at least... I cant remember because there were so many of them. The salad choices were slim two menu options then a daily option. there was only one kind of soup but that didnt seem to bother either of us because the option sounded good and heartwarming in a freezing dining room. We both have a love affair with ceaser salads so we both went with the proscutto wrapped salad and decided to add chicken to it. We both also ordered a cup of the butternut squash soup with a honey drizzle and sourdough tons. We ask for the soup first because were shivering with anticipation... litterally.  After about 15 to 20 minutes(and thinking \\"are they growing the butternut squashes or what?!)  the soup arrived and looked nice. The spoons dived into the well portioned bowl(even though we said cup) and to our astonshament the soup was cold. almost as cold as we were... The taste was fair at best and would have been a lot better if it wasnt a squash slushy! moving onto the salad because it hurts to think of a sad soup. We wanted chicken on it, the salad arrives about another 15 minutes minus said chicken! Not a cluck in site. Instead we were served two rolled up sticks of greens wrapped in ham and was grilled. Grilled lettuce? give me a break (and a discount). The salad was confusing and bizarre. It looked like vomit on the plate and I felt disconnected from the universe. On the way home we both felt like we were going to get sick. My fiance's stomach is in knots right now and we are waiting for the food poisoning to rush us. I have NO IDEA why this place has such a good reputation. It sucks. Its overpriced. Its rude and confused. Next time I will go to dennys.

The citrus in both dishes were quite complimentary.\\n\\nSecond course on the first occasion consisted of the brussel sprouts and the octopus.  The brussel sprouts smelled intoxicating and the taste didn't disappoint.  I mean, these may even rival Uchiko's (sorry Tyson).  I didn't love the octopus - not sure why, just wasn't for me. The portion was a lot smaller than the other dishes we tried as well - keep that in mind.

There is no other way to say it. Private lot? Where? All I could find was the valet lot. And the street parking is limited and a little shady... I originally parked my car a block away from the restaurant on the street but was worried I would get booted, as it was kind of in the middle of no where, no signs, nothin'. Just a couple other cars parked behind me. I quickly peeled out and opted for the complimentary valet. The valet was missing so a line of cars waited for him to come back from his break. Seriously? Mic drop.\\n\\nWe had a reservation for 2 at 7pm on a Saturday night, but weren't seated until 7:15. My friend went ahead and ordered a lychee martini, which was pretty tasty. Once we reached our table, I was instantly pleased. We were seated in the very back corner, with an open window to the street. The weather was PERFECT and made the small room seem bigger with the breeze gently rolling through. I put in an order for a Frankly My Dear cocktail. The lightly floral gin cocktail hit the spot.\\n\\nThe only menu available that night was the Restaurant Week menu, with various course offerings of different price ranges. We chose to order from the $35 menu, which allowed us to choose appetizers or entrees from within both the $25 and $35 menu. I ordered the Grilled New Zealand Lamb Rack with Thai curry with the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, while my friend ordered the Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass with the Lobster Mac and Cheese.\\n\\nJumbo Lump Crab Cake: a single crab cake, chock full of crab, the onion ring on the side wasn't needed. More crab cake please!\\nLobster Mac and Cheese: the highlight of the evening. Yes. It's super heavy, but it's Mac and cheese, what else do you expect from a hearty macaroni? The fried kale is heavenly. The chunks of lobster are limited, so after my only large chunk of lobster, I was lucky if I could find a couple more shreds among the cheesy macaroni.\\n\\nThe sea bass and the lamb rack had the exact same garnish, which I found very odd. I found a lot of the garnishes unnecessary to completing the dishes and just a filler. Get outta here, don't need em. The lamb rack was cooked to a perfect medium. They were a little sweet, and when I dipped the meat in the curry, it resulted in a beautiful reaction in my mouth. I had a bite of my friend's sea bass and we agreed. Melt in your mouth GOOD. Both are impressive pieces of protein, cooked flawlessly.\\n\\nThe tiramisu dessert we got at the end was just ok. Nothing mind blowing.

My family rarely says anything that's wrong with the place other than the 3% added for takeout. But other than that, I DREAM of their black bean nachos, Mac and cheese, housemade fries, and BBQ todu. This was the only BBQ tofu I've ever had and I GLADLY prefer it over any barbecued meat I've ever had! My mom enjoys the BBQ chicken, my sister scarfs down the ribs, and my dad is stuck with the brisket. Luckily for me, I'm just addicted to their side dishes particularly the Mac and cheese and fries. It is the best of each side I've ever had. The fries are perfectly crisp and have a wonderful taste to them where you get a taste of potato and salt in sublime balance. It also comes with a homemade ketchup that isn't exactly Heinz if course, but its delicious in the way it goes with the fries. The Mac and cheese, I can't even explain how good it is. It's perfectly cheesy, creamy, and flavorful like a good southern Mac and cheese should be. It's the only Mac and cheese I'll eat now, since it puts all of the other Mac and cheese's from restaurants I've had to shame. The black bean nachos are nothing like I've ever had. The tortilla chips are homemade obviously, but they are unique in taste. The black beans are very flavorful, and the melted cheese is REAL cheese. It isn't spicy enough for me though, but the flavor makes up for the missing heat. I've also tried the Korean BBQ taco and it's good, but I'm in love with the BBQ tofu.

The menu is small but hits all the right notes, with a couple of options from each of the major brunch categories. I went with eggs en cocotte. Very seasonal, with fresh local mushrooms and asparagus, and toast to sop up the creamy, eggy goodness. My companion chose the campfire trout, which was wrapped in bacon and accompanied by a fried egg and perfect, crispy potato hash. The dessert menu had just three options and seemed a little boring: chocolate cake, root beer float, key lime tart. We shared the key lime, which was quite nice once we scraped off the excessive mountain of whipped cream it was served under. Also, the \\"doughnut of the moment\\" on the appetizer menu was vanilla. Maybe they dumbed things down a little too much for Mother's Day?

I've seen them come and go.  I used to go to John Meuller's old place on Manor Road all the time (a friend brought us a to-go box of brisket and sausage at the hospital when my first child was born).  I have been eating at Franklin since a couple of weeks after he opened the trailer.  For a town to be at the \\"epicenter\\" of the world's greatest bbq, you'd expect there to be many first-rate options in this town.  But there aren't.\\n\\nFor a long time, we had NO world-class bbq in town.  Then Franklin opened up.  And now John Meuller is back. So we have TWO world class joints.\\n\\nThe shining star is the beef short rib.  John used to make this as an \\"every once in a while\\" special at his old place on Manor Road.  I would like to think that after dropping many not-so-subtle hints, I was one of the folks who helped convince him to make it a regular item at his new place.  It is like brisket-on-a-stick.  It brings the perfect ratio of outer, smoky-peppery bark and tender, melt-in-your mouth beef.  It is one of the single greatest smoked food items around, anywhere.\\n\\nThe brisket is a close second for me, for much of the same reasons -- great bark, taste, and tenderness.  And you'll appreciate the burnt end sample he gives you as you prepare to order.\\n\\nSausage is very good -- I tend to prefer the Kreuz and Luling City Market style a BIT more, but not much.  The sausage John serves is very good in its own right.\\n\\nPork Ribs -- flavor is as good as it gets.  At times, they could be a little more tender, but most of the time, they are right on.\\n\\nPork chop -- I've only tasted a bit of a friend's chop, but it was very good.  I just can't bring myself to stray from the beef items.\\n\\nSides -- not a big side man myself, but my kids LOVE potato salad.  My daughter loves bbq, but ALWAYS gets potato salad when she gets bbq. I remember the potato salad at John's old place was really good, so I recommended it to her.  Her eyes got big as she told me \\"dad, this is the best potato salad I've ever had.\\"  So, there you have a review from a true tater salad fan.\\n\\nJohn's hustling and working hard.  He's making great barbecue.  And he's a bit ornery and cantankerous, which I think makes it a perfect snapshot of a true Texas eating experience.  Don't let the ornery fool you -- he's ornery because he's a perfectionist, and he wants to see EVERY customer taken care of.\\n\\nPut all that together with the fact that I can leave my office, order, eat, and be back in less than an hour, and it helps make John Mueller's one of my favorite places in town.  And a reminder, it's not like you can only go when the weather's nice -- I went on a rainy day, and there was no wait.  We ended up eating there, but it's an easy food to pack up to go.  If you want to make your whole office happy, set out a tray full of John Mueller's bbq in the kitchen and watch the eyes roll back into their heads as they take their first bite.\\n\\nFOR THE LOCALS -- we have another first-rate bbq joint in town.  Support John, especially on those inclement days when his sit-down traffic might be a bit light.\\n\\nFOR THE VISITORS -- if you want to experience the taste of true Central Texas BBQ, this is one of two places in town you can get it.  Franklin has been getting a lot of publicity lately, and I love it.  But you'd be remiss in skipping John Mueller's, and honestly, if you're in town for a short visit, not waiting for 1.5 hours just to order your food is a very big advantage.  Sit in the shade of a big old tree and enjoy the Austin sunshine as you eat bbq outside, picnic-style, as God and Davy Crockett surely intended."},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - West 6th","address":"600 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It's been a few days since I got Via 313 pizza, and I'm still dreaming about how DELICIOUS it was.

I ordered boullabaisse, which has been very good in the past, and it was delivered lukewarm and had nothing other than broth, vegetables and 4 mussels in it.  I tried my friend's coq au vin, and it was completely bland and unremarkable.  I didn't try the jam and cheese plates the rest of the party ordered but they said it was good.  If it's something they can just serve out of the box like cheese, jam, wine or beer, it's okay, otherwise it seems like there's an idiot in the kitchen.  And the waitress never stopped by again after taking the order (the food was served by other people) until it was time to try to sell us on dessert.  Most people nonetheless were enjoying themselves, but honestly  I feel like most of the people there aren't too picky about the food and just like the ambience.

So you could be having lunch with the striking on screen couple of SRK Kahn and Rai.  BB could use a few more screens to keep with the theme of the restaurant.  Those that sit in the font are not able to view the films. A clean, modern, and comfortable environment. \\n\\nWe were greeted when we came in, eventually they came over with the water, no other beverages or menu of beverages were offered.  The restaurant might want to consider offering a beverage menu to buffet clients.  Later I saw that they offer a rosewater lassi. This is something I have not seen offered at other restaurants in this metro area, but have experienced in my old stomping grounds. I love a thick rosewater lassi! I would have ordered one if I had known that was on the menu.\\n\\nI enjoyed the selection of this buffet very much.  I have never seen chaat on a buffet.  Good concept. Other featured dishes we experienced that day were; saag, matar mushroom curry, chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, lamb biryani (w/ bones :( ouch! ) and some sort of Manchurian stye breaded cubed fish in tangy sauce with onions and peppers. \\nI understand that the buffet menu changes often. My husband the vegetarian, came back to the table with his plate piled sky high so I know there was no shortage of vegetarian items. Also patrons want to take note that they offer many gluten free items. \\n\\nI love spicy food. I can eat habaneros. I want to say that this cuisine's spiciness was at a good level. I would say the use of the chili pepper is above average compared to other metro are Indian/pakistani restaurants. I am happy for that as many in area are a bit tame for my tastebuds. But it wasn't so spicy that a person couldn't enjoy it. My husband likes mild. He was still able to eat it and finish two big platefuls with a smile. \\nOne thing I will say over all about the cuisine is  the thing that was missing was the intensity of the other flavors.  The depths of flavors/spices/seasoning were missing.  They might want to look at the dates of their dried herbs and spices and update them with fresh. Fresh cinnamon, cardamom, masalas etc could make a big difference. It wasn't bland, but it wasn't robust either. Some flavor, just missing that pizzaz. \\n\\nMy favorite from the buffet was the chaat, the saag, and the Manchurian fish. \\nThe chicken tikka was too sweet for me. I don't really care for added sugar that much. I am more of a savory person. They need to watch the cooking of the naan and the tandoori as many areas on both the bread and the chicken were burnt, but still flavorful.  I suspect that they do make the naan in house. It was flakey and buttery on one side, burnt on the other. \\n\\nWe liked Bollywood Bites.

When I initially walked there, the kitchen was closed. I walked around for an hour until it was 5 and came back. The staff remembered and greeted me and I was immediately able to sit wherever I liked. I chose to sit at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly. She quickly and easily explained everything I asked about on the menu, and when I inquired about the deserts she showed me to the case and went over them one by one.\\n\\nWhen I sat down she disappeared for a good ten minutes, but once she got back to the bar I ordered the Lobster wonton.  It came out in about seven minutes, and it looked delicious. It was a plate of 3 triangle shaped wontons, about the size of a paper football. When I ate it, all of the flavors just came together. Only thing is I wasn't sure if it was the wasabi/berry sauce on top or if it was the middle of the wonton, but it seemed cool. Not cold or uncooked, just the middle parts seemed cool, but it could very well be because the sauce on top was cool. (It was good enough that I'd try them again to find out). \\n\\nNext I decided to try the Shrimp Tom Yum. I'm no fan of broth based soups, but this blew me out of the water. It had this in your face flavor and all of these different flavors came together to create this work of art. Genius really. \\n\\nAnyway I'm feeling good. Ate a light appetizer and a delicious healthy soup. What better way than to negate ALL of that and eat the most unhealthy and decadent slice of cake? I told you they showed me all the desserts, and between they huge gorgeous caramelized apples and the humongous slices of red velvet + whatever I the chef decided to add -cake , I ended up going for the cake. (Honestly the price decided it. The giant apples were 12 bucks and the cake slices were just under 8, and I was ballin on a budget tonight so...)\\n\\n I chose the red velvet cake with the mascarpone filling in the middle. The outside of the cake was covered in a dark, slightly salty chocolate that I forget the name of. The cake was my only disappointment of the evening. The cake itself was a little dry. Also...for me, red velvet is all about the cream cheese. I wasn't thinking and was blinded by all of the pretty sweets, but there was no cream cheese involved with these cakes. Therefore these cakes were fools' red velvet cakes. Anyhow it was dry, lacking cream cheese, and while the mascarpone worked with the cake just fine, it tasted bad when paired with the chocolate...which a good portion of the cake was covered in. So for 8 bucks, I can't toot the horn for it, but I can say apples seem to be their specialty and I plan to go back and try those caramel apples as well as their Fuji Apple drink. \\n\\nI mean all in all it was a great experience. The staff was super friendly and personable, the music was great, the service was great, the food came quickly, and the food was pretty top notch. I came away spending 21.00 on just an appetizer, a soup, and a dessert, so do expect to splurge a little, but the food is well worth it. I'm definitely bringing my boyfriend here next time. Oh and I chose to walk here because while there is a parking lot next door, the website said something about it only being free parking during the lunch service, but for dinner service people would have to look for street parking.

My wife and I, on a trip to Atlanta, liked Mary Mac's so much that we ate here twice in three days. On the first trip we both had (after the complimentary bread basket containing cinnamon rolls, yeast rolls and corn bread) the fried chicken dinner, which comes with two sides (I had fried green potatoes and spiced apples, my wife had the fried green tomatoes and the legendary tomato pie). On our second trip I had ribs instead of chicken with fried green tomatoes and tomato pie, my wife had the fried catfish with sweet potato souffle and -- of course-- the tomato pie. I thought the chicken was excellent-- not quite up to the standards of Magnolia's in Charleston, but very good; my wife thought her chicken was good but a tad dry (mine was not dry at all, so perhaps there is some luck involved). My ribs were also fine, and my wife raved about her catfish. The tomato pie, as you probably guessed by now, is a favorite of ours, and absolutely superb (I am told that it is one of the most requested recipes). My wife thought the sweet potato souffle was good, but she thought it tasted like mashed sweet potatoes, and the spiced apples were also good, tasting somewhat like a baked apple. I would have liked to order the Georgia peach cobbler for dessert, but the portions were so huge that neither of us could eat anything more. Prices are quite reasonable, and service is excellent.

My gf Angie was raving non stop about the octopus from this restaurant, and she insisted that we cannot leave Portland without trying it. On our last night there, we headed to Andina's with over an hour left before closing time. Unfortunately when we arrived, we were told that the kitchen was already closed because business was so slow that night due to the super bowl. At first, I had a bad impression of the place simply because they closed down even though they technically still had over an hour until their actual closing time. And it didn't help that we had a flight back home the next day at 6, and they didn't open the bar until 4pm. But that didn't deter us from making a last stop at Andina's, even with the risk of possibly missing our flight. Let's just say it was a close call, but it was totally worth it. \\n\\nWe got there as soon as the bar opened, and we sat down and ordered two large tapas plates of the de pulpo, which comes with two tentacles in each order. It was love at first bite! The meat was so tender and the char on the tentacles were perfect. The potatoes, chimichurri, and roasted peppers were the perfect compliment to the octopus.

Kane by far made my friends birthday very special. They even brought out a dessert on the house for her. After leaving she forgot her keys. We immediately called the restaurant back the hostess as well as other staff members helped to find them. The salmon chips are amazing! I ordered the brisket  for the first time and it was so tender i cut it with a butter knife. We were all satisfied and will definitely be back to see Kane and the rest of the crew."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I did have an overall good experience here, but it's been a few months since I first went and I haven't had the urge to go back.

I definitely recommend trying the Hama Hama oysters if any so different and has a fruit forward taste! The oyster sliders were also great and the mussels!

Unfortunately this visit was a sub B.   It was Saturday 12/26 and the restaurant was not full.  Server greeted us and made a comment of having 4 of the best bar tenders on tonight.  After waiting 15 minutes for the server to return to take our drink order it then took 20 minutes to get our first round delivered, STRIKE 1&2.   Dinner rolls were served before we got our drinks, not sure if this is normal but it seems that a drink would be the right thing to have while conversing and looking at the menu, STRIKE 3.  We selected two appetizers and had my wife order them, thought it would be easier that way, server said ok and then asked what I was having, STRIKE 4.  Somewhat of an insult to my wife to assume she was having two appetizers.  Next came salads, they were good.  At that point we realized the server forgot our appetizers and inquired and he said yes he did forget and apologized.  We immediately said pass on them please as we knew at that point that our entrees were already fired up and didn't want to have to choke down the appetizers while our entrees were sitting under a heat lamp.   My friend ordered another drink before the entrees were served and it got delivered \\"promptly\\" while taking his last bite, he said pass, STRIKE 5.  All the entrees were excellent as usual and we were all members of the clean plate club.  The server said the desserts were on the house and he picked three - why weren't we allowed to pick? STRIKE 5 1/2.  We all had coffee, they were not on the house, why not?  At a total cost of about $1, why not throw them in?  STRIKE 6 - you're out.  Overall it was a frustrating and bad experience for the four of us, the food was very good as usual but you can't rely on just good food to make a good dining experience.  BTW, I still gave a 20% tip.  The server was pleasant, just not an expert server - maybe he was new?

The atmosphere of this cavernous converted wherehouse space does wonders for the eyes but makes for a tough time for the ears--perhaps the worst accoustics in any Atlanta establishment. Another atmospheric note, it's dark in there!  I find myself squinting to find the bathroom. So okay, the place is loud and it is hard to hear the person next to you, and its dark and too cool for school, but  I'll forgive her. The bar area is hopping with action, a mostly 30something crowd dressed in the latest designer jeans and finery. There's always a few out of town business guys in dress slacks and golf shirts that seem ever so out of place, but they are happy to gawk at the gliteri nontheless. The bar offers a nice array of martinis and specialty drinks made with house infused vodkas and liquers that loom overhead in clear acrylc tanks.  Very cool.  The restaurant offers an odd assortment of lesser know boutique wines that are available in a variety of serving sizes to allow for tasting.  The wines are served from beer keg-like vessels in a huge tower that sit next to the bar.  Two is one of the few Amercian restaurants to offer wine served in this manner.  The list is obscure and therefore hard to navigate, and seems to be quite pricey for wine that comes in \\"bulk\\" with no corks or bottles.  They also have a nasty habit of serving the white wine just above room temperature which is odd to me. I questioned this practice and the server snapped back that \\"that is the way we do it here\\" all the while she is holding an ice bucket with ice to chill our carafe.  I reply so it is too warm as you have brought us an ice carafe, \\"well, yah people like it served colder\\".  Oh, I reply.  Another quirky incident was upon request for a birthday candle to top our cupcake dessert, the same waitress informed us \\"that the owner hates birthday candle and thinks they are tacky\\" and they don't have any candle.  After dissapearing from our table for a while--perhaps put off by our blank stares about the birthday candle remark, she returned with a candle.  \\"Well\\", she said \\"one of the server keeps candles for us, but instead of the restaurant offering candles we just comp the dessert.\\"  Sure enoough the dessert was listed full price on our check, but we got the candle for free.  So what about the food?  The menu is broken into four sections that offer tapas like starters, salds, entrees and desserts.  I find some of the offerings appealing but dissapointing in ther execution.  For example the braised bbq brisket (a supposed house specialty) arrives stringy and overly salted (salt seems to be a problem with many of the dishes here) and leaves me tempted to send it back.  A more successfull offering is the Salmon Chips, good qualiy smoked salmon mixed with herbs and cream cheese on homemade potato chips.  Another popular dish here is the scallops (It's popularity based on the lack of other lighter offerings I suspect) but the scallops arrive a bit tough and swimming in a cream!? sauce over grits--not so light afterall. So my meal is dissapointing, and the service is too casual to be effective, but oh that sexy bar area is calling my name."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"If this place were any more Austin, it could run for mayor. \\n\\nI love the vibe of the space and every single thing on the menu at BCC.

One shrimp placed artistically upon a small scoop of cheesy grits...spectacular and would have liked to have seen a bit more on the plate. The crispy prosciutto chip accompanying it made for a perfect bite. The crab fondue was the best dish of the night. Trust me...order it. The tomato plate was disappointing - four wedges of underripe tomato with a sprinkling of arugula and a bland dressing. \\nThird courses: When do two scallops qualify as an entree?

Inside, they have a small gift shop on the right side.  On the left, there are a few choices for seating, including a round raw bar, booth seats, main dining room, and bar.  I think there's also an upstairs dining area.\\n\\nWe slid into a cozy (read: tight), white, slatted wood booth.  Each of the booths seem to feature a bit of local history; ours discussed a publication that used to be published on the upper level on the Union Oyster House building during the colonial period.  Wait staff were direct and competent.\\n\\nWe ordered some IPAs then went for a sampling of the food.  The New England clam chowder was very classic, super thick and creamy with a few clams and potatoes, pretty tasty.  The cold seafood sampler included (2 each) very fresh raw oysters and cherrystones, and nicely done cocktail shrimp, retaining a crisp on biting.  Mussels were supposed to be Basque style but couldn't tell, broth was watery and not impressive; mussels were ok, a mix of plump, yellow toned ones and very small, paler ones in a large bowl with two garlicky, toasted bread slices.  The blackened sea scallops were well prepared, but a bit too heavy on the seasoning.  Could pass on the accompaniments: red potato mash too gummy and sweet potato mash too sweet.  \\n\\nMy recommendation?  Get a seat at the raw bar, knock down some raw oysters and other seafood with a beer and soak in the atmosphere."},{"name":"Mixtura","address":"300 Beacon St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Our first time at Mixtura - very impressed!!!

I went to the door of Marathon with 30 of my friends who'd just gone inside after a Timbers game. I was carrying a half cup of beer from the Timbers game - I'd forgotten it was in my hand. The bouncer told me I couldn't bring beer into the bar. I knew this, apologized, walked outside and poured it out, couldn't find a garbage can, so I crumpled up the cup and put it in my pocket. I walked back to the bouncer and he would not let me in. He explained to me it was illegal to walk outside with a beer in my hand. I apologized and explained I'd forgotten and poured it out. He told me to get the f%#@ out of his bar. Literally. I had given him no attitude, but had apparently offended him by looking like I was trying to sneak a half cup of warm beer into his bar. That was my second beer of the day - I was not drunk or anything. I civilly tried to plead my case that it was a mistake, but he told me to gtf out of his bar again. Truly unnecessary, one to use profanity and two to prevent me from entering his bar. I understand it's his prerogative and he's under no obligation to serve me, but there are ways to size up a situation and ways to exercise your right as a bouncer. He failed at both.\\n\\nSecond part of the story is I saw him turn away Sounders fans right after giving me the Heisman. Now, I've never actually been inside Marathon, but apparently they have a ban on Sounders fans. I'm not sure if it's because they don't like them or if it's more pragmatic that they don't want any fights. I hope it's the latter, but given the attitude of the bouncer, I suspect it's the former. They were told they were not wanted there, not sure if profanity was used.\\n\\nI found myself in a weird situation - sitting outside with 10 Sounders fans, all of us rejected by the guy at the front door. I turned to them and told them it's not very neighborly and respectful to treat people that have traveled for 3-4 hours to visit your town by banning them from your bar, no matter how bad the rivalry is. I get the whole rivalry thing, but these guys were not drunk hooligans - they were in their 40's and 50's, well-behaved job-holding fathers of children who were 200 miles from home and trying to kill a couple of hours before their train home. Their team had just been shellacked (4-0 in first half, ended 4-2) and they had their tails between their legs and weren't looking for trouble. Do we really need to treat guests in our city like this, particularly after a game we won so handily? I ended up taking them to another bar and buying them all a round of drinks, complete with good-natured ribbing for their team's sorry showing at the game.\\n\\nThanks Marathon Bouncer for giving me a reason never to go to your bar again. I wish I could give you 0 stars."},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The worst \\nDelivery took 2 hours \\nThey didn't even apologize \\nPretty sure they are the worst!"},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The hamburgers were good enough with interesting toppings but none of the excitement that is generated by other high-end burger places.

I had to post something just to speak about how incredible my experiences there have been. \\nMy first time here I came in with a party of 15 people for my dear friend and head bartender's birthday. They accommodated my late made reservation on the patio. The patio is the best in the city; gorgeously lit, tons of plants  and green space and hang out areas AND its own bar! \\n Our server that night, Patrick, provided our large group with some of the best hospitality I have ever experienced. The cocktails were amazing and Chef Joe Schafer's food blew everyone away. His bone marrow dish with local muscadines was the best dish I have ate this year. Seriously. Now I have cravings for it.\\nI came back again this week while entertaining a \\"big wig\\" in the bar industry in town from New York. I brought him here because this was the best meal, drinks, and service I had this year and AGAIN they delivered. \\nThe Manager Sean Sullivan went above and beyond on a very busy night and found us spots at the bar so we could sit with bartender Paige lane. I highly recommend you do this. Even if just for cocktails before dinner. Paige has a brilliant mind for cocktails and flavor combinations so if you want her to craft something specially for you, she's your girl. We had an array of small plates at the bar. The \\"breakfast orgasm\\" (as we named it) was absolutely incredible. Corn grits, sweet bacon and a perfectly cooked runny egg. I also loved the lamb belly. \\nIf you're very classy (as we obviously were) ask Paige to finish your bone marrow by shooting your favorite whiskey down the bone like a shot luge (I suggest Slow & Low, which they now carry!)\\nTIP: keep it classy by tucking your napkin in your shirt to prevent spillage. And thank your bartender if this happens, because it might be the best whiskey experience you've ever had the privilege of having after the best dish you've had the privilege of eating.   \\nLastly, I have to mention the desserts. I never get desserts but I was easily persuaded when I found out the pastry chef  here was the pink haired diva of sweets Chrysta Poulos. She has been crafting her toffee pudding her whole career and it was the best dessert I've ever tasted. From a savory only girl, TRUST ME. I almost fainted at the IPA caramel the first time, and re-fainted at the coffee number she did on it the second time. \\n\\nFlat out best restaurant experience x2 I've had in Atlanta, I don't usually review anyone but I had to.

BUT THE BEST PART... the best part was while we were eating, a mouse came scurrying out from the seat cushion, came up on his hind legs, and looked at us while attempting to get a piece of food someone had dropped at a table next to us. He then turned around jumped on the cushion and dove into the crack in the seats. My husband got up and lifted the cushion to which we found in horror ... mounds of mice droppings.

The grilled endive salad (caesar basically but more interesting) was incredible.  The dressing wasn't overly garlicy, the whole anchovy on the top wasn't the usual overly salted thing, but almost tasted like fresh anchovies--better quality, mildly marinated, wonderful.  The grilled endive gave the whole thing a wonderful smokey flavor.  I also had the gnocchi which was amazing.  Made with pumpkin, leeks, potato and had an incredible mixture of spices that really made it unusual.  My other friend had the mussels and after tasting one, I have to say it was not great.  The mussels had a very strong flavor--not spoiled, just not sweet and fresh tasting.  She didn't seem to mind, but I couldn't have eated this dish.  Service was extremely friendly.

We did Uber to get to the restaurant. A perfect location since we have yet to explore Boston Commons and Quincy Market, all in close proximity. Once you enter the restaurant there is a distinct smell of raw seafood but you get immune to it after a while. We chose to sit in a booth -quite cramped but was cozy nonetheless. We got the seafood platter-waiter said it is good for 2-3 people; clam chowder, scrod and crab cake. Quite disappointed with the platter, there were ton of fries and onion rings  but a handful of seafood-maybe a few pieces of squid rings, fried oysters and fried fish which I particularly like. If you are looking for more seafood in this platter, then this will be a bummer. Chowder was great! crab cake is also okay accompanied with a huge serving of mashed potatoes that is so bland. The scrod -my daughter was given a choice of fried or grilled and she chose the latter. Waiter  recommended blackened Cajun flavor but it was bitter in my honest opinion. I should have tried the fresh oyster but opted out since I will be the only one ending up eating it. Looking back, I should have. It may be the restaurant's specialty having been named as such. You got to have boston cream pie in Boston so we were convinced to have one-very rich and the caramel syrup is so yummy. The area for the bar is nice.

It's hard to want them to be better though because they make this place great too.  One of those things is that the place is quite small.  It has a capacity for maybe 30 people.  At the same time it is nice because you can usually reserve a table easily not too far in advance.  My girlfriend made a reservation once on a weekday night 30 minutes before we wanted to go. They have a 1.5 hour limit on tables, so it helps get people in and out. On the other hand, the small space can get quite crowded and pretty loud.  All in all, it has great pizza and wine.  The desserts and appetizers seem a little high brow, but it is worth trying them out while you wait for your pizza to cook in an authentic brick oven.  Any of the pizza options are great, but I notice the pizza with capers comes with too many capers-- I am not a fan as it is, so 1 caper is too many in my book. Long story short, if you are wanting to take a date here it would be good, but be prepared to be cramped and hard of hearing."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came here for brunch during our trip to Boston! It's located on a busy street in Beacon Hill, just several blocks away from the popular Acorn Street. We arrived at around 12:30 and had no problem finding a table. When you enter, you first place your order with one of the cooks, then you pay at the register, and then someone seats you. The lady who took my order was rude but the cashier and our waiter were very nice. We were seated at a nice table by the windows. I would say the design of the restaurant is a hybrid of a cafeteria and a diner. Since there were multiple food places we wanted to try out in Boston, we decided to try a little at each place so we just got the Caramel and banana french toast since it seemed like the most popular item and since it's not worth it to pay $10 for an omelette when you can make it at home for like $2. The french toast was pretty good. It was a nice balance of sweet and savory, with the sweet being the fresh bananas, caramel drizzle, and powdered sugar and the savory being the egg toast. It was a pretty big portion and is definitely shareable between 2 people. I wouldn't say this is the most amazing place I've ever been to but it gets the job done if you're looking for a nice breakfast place."},{"name":"J Liu Restaurant & Bar","address":"6880 N High St","city":"Worthington","stars":"3","text":"I was taking my fiance out for a night of shopping and decided to surprise her with dinner at J. Liu... a restaurant that  she has always wanted to go to. After driving around the parking lot for 10 minutes we finally parked. We arrived at the location and waited about 15 minutes to be seated (no big deal). The manager was polite and acknowledged our wait. We were eventually seated on the restaurant side, which nice, clean and excellently decorated. Then we waited... and waited... finally, after about 15 minutes, our waitress comes to our table to get our drink order. My fiance got water but requested lemons while I got a cock tale. The waitress acknowledged that we needed bread plates and bread and ventured to go grab some... another 15 minutes passed and she returns with my drink and her lemons. She essentially threw the lemons on the table and promptly left. She didn't acknowledge us at all... she just... left. Another 10 minutes passed and she finally ask to take our order. As we order our food, my fiance let her know that she has an allergy to fish. The waitress acknowledged this and took our order. My fiance was wanting to make one last request from the menu, but once again, the waitress left too quickly. About 15 minutes passed, and the waitress reappears to let my fiance know that the food she ordered is actually cooked in fish sauce and she would have to order again. We get another menu and she makes a second selection. During this time, we see the waitress assisting a family next to ours (basically waiting on them hand and foot) while we sat. Mind you, we never received acknowledgement or even the bread that everyone else got. Fast forward a little bit, the waitress returned saying that the chef decided to cook her original meal in a chili sauce instead of fish sauce, but then promptly left. Our food was brought out shortly after by another staff member. I will say, the one redeeming factor of this place is that their food was exceptional. A little pricey, but good. I ordered the Scallops and she ordered the Pad Thai. Both was wonderful. Throughout our meal, the waitress never acknowledged us, but only to box up our meals. We wanted to get desert there, but when I asked, she essentially ignored my request. When she returned, she asked us if we wanted a desert menu like she never heard us before. We paid our check and promptly left dishearted. \\n\\nTL:DR: Bad parking, Great Food, Poor...

I SPECIFICALLY requested it be cooked nice juicy red (medium rare-rare), and I specifically said juicy red, so that they would relay this to the chef. However the waitress INSISTED on a clasification, and I picked medium rare. I guess in Top of the Hub, medium rare means grey on the inside, dry, and low quality meat. The meat I received seemed more of a flank steak and was very sub par; a major dissappointment, which fortunately did not take away from other parts of the evening. \\n\\nIf they redid their Hangar steak and announced it, I would consider going back again and trying it again.

The upscale, food snob, trendy spot especially. \\n\\nI love that the menu is constantly changing because they're always introducing something new and delicious. This can be quite unfortunate at times when you really want to order something you've had before and can't, but it encourages me to try different items. The food ranges from very inventive, great combinations I'm unsure of trying to the easy to please everyone options (i.e. the Big Ass Burger, which is awesome).\\n\\nSome of my favorite items have been:\\n\\n-Shrimp and Grits- creamy, perfectly seasoned, and I practically had to lick off of the plate\\n-Scallops- cooked to perfection, not chewy or slimy\\n-Empanadas- melt in your mouth brisket, flavorful aioli, and something you may fight for the last piece of if you choose to share appetizers\\n-Bread Pudding- not too gooey and not too firm with the perfect sweetness and flavor combinations \\n\\nTo be honest, I'm drooling a bit as I type and recall how great these items were.\\n\\nThe drinks here are very strong, especially the in-house infused vodkas so if you're a lightweight or don't want to taste the alcohol in your drink, keep that in mind. They have a full bar with a great selection of drinks, and in the summer they make fabulous red and white Sangria.\\n\\nIf the high quality food wasn't enough to keep me coming back, I really love the look and feel of this place. It's in an old industrial section of town in a remodeled warehouse. The decor is gorgeous and during the summer the gigantic windows are opened to the patio while the billowing curtains give you glimpses of the outside. There are very comfortable cool couch seats as well as tables, and the bar is centrally located and a delight to look at. It has a very swanky, trendy, urban feel to it that I love.\\n\\nThis is a great place for dates or ladies nights, but please do not bring your kids.

However as we drove into the parking lot, we remembered we had seen signs for this Brazilian churrascaria in the same strip mall, and so we stopped by to get prices. My wife ran inside, and came back with the basic details - grilled meats on large skewers, served tableside, just like other churrascarias we have been to in the past. Price? Adults just under $24, and kids around $11. \\n\\nWe all chose to give it a shot, and boy are we glad we did! The place wasn't very busy, and service was very good. The salad bar was not very big, but had plenty of options and items were very fresh. However, my policy is that I don't fill up on the salad when there is perfectly good meat available, so I only tried a few things from the cold bar. There is also a hot bar with 2 kinds of beans, 2 kinds of rice (with or without veggies) and other hot food items (what appeared to be fish, and a very tasty chicken in a yellow gravy that we all loved, but had to remind ourselves again of the meat to come).\\n\\nThere were men with skewers of meat waiting for us when we returned to our table. From garlic sirloin to bacon wrapped chicken and bacon wrapped filet, pork sirloin, pork sausages, grilled chicken, and the house specialty - a large piece of top sirloin that is crispy on the outside, but moist, flavorful and pink / red in the middle, every piece of meat we tried was exceptionally good. In fact, the only thing that was slightly disappointing was that they didn't bring me a glass of water as I requested. Everything else was of excellent quality, the meats were tasty, and we all especially enjoyed the bacon-wrapped options (naturally!).\\n\\nCompared to some of the similar locations here in Orlando, this one is not quite as fancy, with TVs on the wall showing a soccer game, but still very nice (cloth napkins and table coverings) and the salad bar was not nearly as large, and it is possible that there might not have been quite as many types of meats offered tableside - but for the price, this is a much better value. And when the check arrived, we found that they did not charge us for our 2 kids (ages 5 and 8) since most of the time they were eating portions from the meats we were served anyway.  That made it a very affordable alternative to the more expensive churrascarias locally, and the end result was just as good - incredibly good meats with quality side items available.\\n\\nWhether you are a tourist visiting Orlando or a local looking for good food without being too expensive, this is a great option for the whole family!"},{"name":"Min-Ga Korean Restaurant","address":"800 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I came here by myself to eat.

I shoulda got the seafood version to be exactly comparing apples to apples, but for some reason I didnt.\\n\\nThe \\"ban chan\\" which are the small dishes prior to the meal were pretty good. there were 9 in total and had 'kkak doo gi' (raddish based kimchee) which was nice. They also had pickled cucumbers and spicy pickled cucumbers, which was nice.  Presentation was nice, she made a 3 by 3 spread and deliberately made it line up like a diamond (or paralellogram for those 5th graders keeping score at home).\\n\\nThe Kalbi, while not cooked before your eyes, comes out on a skillet (like fajitas) and they cut it in front of you.  The pro of this style is that you dont smell like meat smoke, but the con is that you can't cook the kalbi to the 'done-ness' you prefer.

I dunno why i care, but every place that ahd it come out boiling and an egg you crack yourself tasted really good, so perhaps that's my standard, ha!  anyway, other than the lack of egg, (it wasnt even already put in there) i thought it was good. There were lots of pieces of meat alongside mushrooms and green onions with spices.  While more flavorful than San-Su, both restaurants lacked a certain savory flavor in the broth.  Perhaps it is because they are both not 'soon tofu' only restuarants (which exist) so I guess it's not in their wheel house to be awesome.\\n\\nService wise, it was pretty good since the waitress seemed like an older Korean first generation lady.  but when i got there around 6, there were maybe only 3-4 other tables, which is easily servicable by 1 person.

I had the tomato basil (chilled) soup both times and I L-O-V-E it.\\nDay 1:  I had the greek salad/tomato basil soup combo ($7.50). Soup: delish. Salad: okay.  I loved the balsamic dressing, but the veggies seemed to be maybe a day or two past their prime.  I went around 1:15-1:30 and it was PACKED.  I was kind of surprised.  It's a small place...if I had wanted to eat in, there wouldn't have been room.  It does get crowded waiting, and I did end up waiting longer than I liked, but the soup had me going back the next day.\\nDay 2: I had the chicken toscana/tomato basil soup combo.  Sandwich looked a little crispy, but it was good.  Better than the salad.  Soup was still awesome.  This time I was there around noon and it was EMPTY. It was great.  Ate there, and noticed people started filing in around 12:30-12:45, so if you want to go and eat in, go early.\\nOverall, I love the place.

The oysters are each approx. $1 more expensive than they should be... seriously folks?  $3.50 and $3.75 a pop?  At that price, I'm looking for pearls in each and every one.  Also, the most affordable fish entree (aside from the fish & chips entree which is a steep $20) is $24 and not only is it a tiny portion, it comes with absolutely nothing save for some lemon juice and olive oil... i.e. nothing.\\n\\n* Service was extremely slow.  It took forever for our drinks to arrive and our server seemed to have totally forgotten about them.  We had to remind her about them well after our appetizers arrived.  Then it took, no joke, approx. 30 mins for our entree to arrive after she cleared our appetizers plates.\\n\\n* Extremely limited oyster selection for an oyster bar.  If you're going to say that you're an oyster bar, I expect a decent selection.  And, no, a decent selection does not equal one East Coast option and one West Coast option which if you close your eyes while eating taste pretty much the same.  Where's the variety?!\\n\\n* Cramped seating.  For such a large building, the tables were extremely close together.  Forget having a romantic dinner here, at least if you're seated at a two-top, unless by romantic you mean that the folks at the tables on either side of you can easily hear everything you're saying and could easily join your conversation without remotely having to raise their voice.\\n\\n* For the price, the food isn't that great.  The she-crab soup was extremely salty, as was the octopus, and the $24 fish was overcooked.  The hush puppies - which are intended to accompany savory entrees - were drenched in powdered sugar... really? fish and sugar?!  And the beignets, which our server assured us were light and fluffy, we anything but. They were incredibly dense and soaked in an overly sweet syrup.\\n\\nAlso, two things that probably wouldn't have bothered me if everything else was spot on...\\n\\n* Our server highly recommended the shrimp small plate, but did not convey just how much of a pain in the arse it was, in fact she downplayed it.  We specifically mentioned that we hate peel & eat shrimp because we never find that it's worth the effort plus it tends to be ridiculously messy.  Well folks, this shrimp dish is that to the nth degree.  Because of the sauce it is particularly messy and for some reason it was practically impossible to remove more than three-quarters of the meat from the shell.  At the price they're charging, I think it's only fair that I get everything I'm paying for.\\n\\n* At the end of the evening, we asked whether they offered Irish or similar coffee drinks.  Our server said yes, so we ordered two.  Well, their version of such coffee drinks is to bring you coffee and then a shot of the alcohol separately.  I know, this is a really small thing, but at this point I had had it.  I have never been anywhere that offered such drinks where I had to mix my own beverage and it didn't come all nice and frothy from either the addition of whipped cream or steamed milk.\\n\\nSo yeah, a huge disappointment and I would not return in the future nor would I recommend it.

A total winner that will have to become a  regular on my soon-to-be often visits.  The garlicky edamame were delicious and addictive.  And the tuna tataki was to die for.\\n\\nBut the one dish that knocked it out of the park for me were the incredible pork/lotus gyoza.  Talk about an astounding combination!  And unusual.

We have never been so I thought it would be a nice occasion. I'm a little hesitant in going here after reading the reviews about being treated poorly. I'm 23 and plan on wearing at least a shirt and tie. I also plan on spending about $250 on the meal. For me, spending $250 on a 2 person meal is quite extravagant so I have some expectations and I hope I'm not disappointed.\\n\\nI made a reservation about two weeks before the night we went. I asked for a window seat. The woman on the phone told me that she would add a note to our reservation that we requested a window seat. However, window seats are not guaranteed and that we could wait until one is available.\\n\\nThis in itself makes me uncomfortable because to me it means, \\"when you get here and we'll size you up and see if you're good enough for a window seat.\\"\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMy girlfriend and I arrived promptly for our reservation. I decided to go all out and wear a suit. She wore a black cocktail dress. As we walked into the Prudential tower we were greeted by the first hostess. She asked for my name and reservation and said that I could go right on up. We were very excited and full of anticipation as the elevator traveled to the \\"Top of the Hub.\\"\\n\\nWe walked to the counter and were not welcomed by the hostess. I had to initiate the, \\"Hi we have reservations chat.\\" The hostess found us on their computer and said she could seat us right away. She then took us to a table that sat farthest away from the windows. I said, \\"We asked for a window seat when we made our reservation.\\" The hostess said, \\"Oh, well they are not guaranteed and you could wait 45 minutes for a window seat.\\" So she took us to the bar where we waited for a window seat. \\n\\nThe two bartenders were awful and didn't have enough time to take drink orders from people sitting at the bar while also servicing the rest of the restaurant. After about a 5 minute wait I was able to order a beer and a glass of merlot for $15. Beer is not served in a pint glass either; it's smaller like the kind you get orange juice in. I sat in the chair and looked around. In a suit and tie you are almost overdressed for the place. There were a handful of tourist families wearing jeans and t-shirts in the place. Approximately 15 minutes later the hostess came over to the bar to get us.\\n\\nIn what was the rudest move of the night she asked the couple to my right if they were me; in what was the worst attempt at pronouncing my last name that I have ever heard in my life. As I made eye contact with her she skipped over me and asked the couple to my left if they were me. I then said, I think you're trying to say my name. After that she took us to a nice window seat with a view of Cambridge.\\n\\nAfter being seated we ordered the Top of the Hub tasting menu with wines. The food was very good and my girlfriend complimented the wine pairings. The beef was a little burnt on the outside for what was supposed to be medium rare. The service appeared good but that was probably because the waiter had to return to deliver each course of the 5 course meal. He failed to refill my glass of water.\\n\\nAll in all, we did enjoy the restaurant. We walked away thinking the dinner and night out was very fancy. The food was generally very good and the view was amazing. However, I do expect to receive better service than I did after dropping $275. Going to a fancy restaurant is not just created with good food the atmosphere has to be right. Even with the Boston skylight the staff's performance makes the atmosphere pretty grim.\\n\\nTo the restaurant:\\n1. You should either take reservations for window seats or don't. Don't create this middle ground where anyone off the street can request a window seat when I made reservations two weeks in advance. \\n\\nTo the hostess:\\n1. If someone requests a window seat and you don't have one you should let them know prior to taking them to the table farthest from the window.\\n2. Don't discriminate against young couples- especially when they are dressed nicer than you could afford.\\n3. Don't act haughty like your some high class broad, you're a hostess for what has become a tourist attraction. And you're not the attraction...\\n4.
