I used to eat here a lot when I went to Emerson, but haven't been for a few years.

Definitely enough for two meals (in fact we all had leftovers). My sandwich had Italian tuna, tomatoes, red onions, hard-boiled egg, lettuce, olive tapenade, and an aioli, all on crusty bread, and came with a great green bean and tomato salad.\\n\\nI tried my friend's Benny sandwich-which was a special and recommended by our waitress-and I actually haven't been able to stop thinking about it since.

Growing up the Rio Grande Valley, I've had my fair share of tacos (maybe too many) so I feel like I can speak the truth about the \\"Art\\" of Tacos. First time I went there I ordered the beef fajita tacos without onions, so far - this being the best option on the menu I've encountered. The cilantro was fresh, beef fajita was plentiful and not too salty (I like bland food though). The two tacos were full of meat and pretty good by themselves as a meal. This last time I tried the Al Pastor tacos and was surprised to find that they were inconsistent with what I'm used to with Al Pastor. No pineapple? I would have preferred a little sweet on this taco since the meat was way too spicy for me. I'm not one for spice, but I like to challenge myself at times. The meat was alright, but not enough for me to order this taco again. I will return to Art of Tacos but I don't think they are the \\"Best Tacos in the World\\".

In terms of ordering food, you have to order in the front section first at the cashier and then they bring the food over to your table. I got an Eggs Benedict and it was quite delectable! In particular, the hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy and the side potatoes were well seasoned.

Unfortunately, for $9 for a \\"large\\" order they seemed to be stingy on the proportion... we ran out of guac but had plenty of chips left. I wouldn't recommend the rice bowls because they're just bowls of vegetables really and super spicy if you like that kind of thing. Wasn't really worth it. The tacos and guac are great though.

I savored every bite and was so sad when I finished the whole thing. It'd be even better if the eggs were more runny so that when I cut it the yolk oozes out. The eggs I had were a bit overcooked.

Excellent mango lassis and chicken tikka masala, so they've got the basics nailed. The trio of condiments also tasted fresh and bright.

Then again he may have been just an associate of the Godfather. Or maybe he was a complete nobody. I never did find out. I was walking along a side street off of Hanover, when I spotted a small storefront with a sign in the window that read \\"Members Only\\". The North End has been an Italian neighborhood for decades. A real, old-fashioned Italian enclave, complete with mafia types (according to the books I've read, anyway). Mobsters have their own hangouts, which they call  \\"social clubs\\", and they put little signs on them, like the one in the window of  this storefront. I'd never actually seen one in person, however, and I decided this place would make a great photo op. As I was lining up the shot, however, I heard a raspy voice saying \\"No pitchers! No pitchers! We don't want nobody takin' pitchers around here!\\" Looking to my left, I saw an old geezer, very agitated, stalking down the sidewalk towards me. I thought the guy was putting me on, at first----------the storefront looked like it was being used to store old furniture, and the sign was just a piece of hand-lettered cardboard. But the old guy was very aggressive. He planted himself right in front of me, blocking any possibility of a shot, and kept demanding to know why I was taking pictures. It was like that scene in \\"Good Fellas\\" where Joe Pesci keeps saying \\"What do you mean I'm funny? What, I'm like a clown, I amuse you?\\" I kept waiting for the old guy to drop the act. But that moment never came. Instead,  the situation actually got worse.I found myself surrounded by several neighborhood locals who, I swear, just materialized behind me, as I was being confronted by the old man. Up to this point, I hadn't been able to get a word out, primarily because I was too surprised to speak---------I'd never had an experience remotely like this before. When one of the newcomers demanded to know what I was doing, however, I managed to blurt out that I was just a harmless tourist, out taking pictures of the quaint and colorful North End. (I didn't actually use all those wise-ass adjectives when I spoke-------I stuck with respectful, business-like verbs and nouns.) \\"Why aren't you over at the fuckin' Old North Church, with all the other tourists? What are you takin' pictures here for?\\", one of the newcomers demanded. Excellent questions, I thought to myself. Things were getting really uncomfortable.

We Arrived at 8:38pm, 20 minutes before our 9pm reservation and we're told to go have a drink somewhere else and come back. When we came back at 9pm we were seated in a nice patio setting. The manager noticed our table was very wobbly and my friends water was spilling. Said he would fix it right away and never came back. (We did have someone else fix it at our request).  We ordered a bottle of house white to go with our meal and the waitress didn't come back to take our food order until 1 hour after we arrived, 10pm!!! The man next to us had already had his complete meal and left. And another couple who arrived long after us were eating there entrees. At 10:40, we still not received our entrees and I decided to complain, as we wanted to leave. After speaking to 2 different managers, we were brought our food, 2 hours after arriving. At that time being famished and after a bottle of wine, we decided that we were happy with the sides being removed from the bill and 15% off, which brought our bill to $115.00. The side mushrooms were not tasty at all, the side Brussels were floating in oil, the lobster was done to perfection,  the prawns were very overcooked,  and the steak was alright. \\nAfter a 2 hour wait for food, our meal should have been complimentary.  One of the managers gave us his card and said to contact him so we could see the great service the restaurant truly has to offer. I won't risk going back to spend anymore money at an establishment in vancouver that clearly has zero customer service starting with the hostess at the front door.

While waiting I looked at the limited selection but knew what I wanted to try. \\n\\nBetween the 2 of us we shared the following: \\n\\n-Blueberry bourbon basil - the bright purple glaze is beautiful/breath taking but it was a little to sweet for me.\\n\\n-Meyer lemon and key lime curd - the key lime curd filling had just enough tart. The powdered sugar on the outside was like icing on the cake. \\n\\n-Chocolate almond ganache - dark chocolate ganache with bits of almond. I was happy to see that BSD didn't use artificial chocolate frosting like other donut chains. \\n\\nOur of the 3, Meyer lemon and key lime curd was my favorite, followed by chocolate almond ganache than the blueberry bourbon basil. The dough is fresh, fluffy, soft and so different from other donut chains. BSD uses high quality ingredients which is very obvious when you take a bite or 2. \\n\\nThe donuts are messy when eating whether or not you share it with someone. I suggest a cup of water after eating the donuts. \\n\\nGetting a donut for dessert is actually a good deal and super cheap. Think about it, if you go to a dessert place, a dessert can be upwards of $5.00-$10.00 where as a average donut is only $3.50. The only thing is BSD closes at 7pm daily or earlier in the day once they have sold out. However, customers can always purchase a box earlier in the day and indulge it later in the day.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and skip donut chains. Once you try how amazing BSD is - you will never look back. No artificial flavors, ingredients and preservatives. You just can't beat that. Go ahead and indulge.

The other guy comes over laughing and shaking his head at me. \\nThat is something you should never do in customer service (trust me I work in CS) at least to someone's face. All I wanted was some food like the picture minus the egg, instead I was being laughed at and made to feel stupid. I told them don't worry about it and walked away.

Nowadays I order the grapefruit juice because I like it and even if it isn't fresh, it still tastes pretty good.\\n\\nThe next decision was what to eat.  I'd been eating a lot of eggs while dad was here visiting, but said what the hell and ordered the prosciutto, artichoke and pecorino romano scramble.

The layout is a little weird, with cafeteria-style order line (located way at the back of the restaurant) and similar cafeteria-esque seating.

The first burger I got from here was the lamb burger, which I ordered medium but came to me dry, although I suppose lamb can dry out a lot easier than beef can. I've also tried the Goodnight, the Magic Shroom, El Diablo, and the Primetime. The Goodnight is delicious and has a nice balance between sweet and savory.  El Diablo was not as spicy as I thought it was going to be, but it still tasted good. And the Primetime was good, but I don't think it warranted the extra money - my Primetime came over sauced and aiolid, but the flavors were good and the truffle shined.  The Magic Shroom (+ caramelized onions) remains my favorite because the earthiness of the mushrooms plays really well with the goat cheese and basil. Apart from the lamb burger, the patties have been cooked perfectly every time I've been here. Be sure to try the whole wheat bun because it adds a bit of texture with the seeds on top and nuttiness as a backnote.\\n\\nThe shakes at Hopdoddy are spot on. I've gotten the sea salt caramel one (which could've used more salt to me) and one of their seasonal specials - the peach cobbler. Both were thick and smooth, and the peach cobbler had bits of cobbler crust in it that was worth every penny. Their homemade condiments are also delicious. The mustard is a clear winner in my books over the bbq and chipotle ketchup, not to say that they're not amazing either.\\n\\nExpect a wait if you go for a meal and be delighted when you get your food within 20 minutes because everybody wants a bite of the delicious burgers here. The line can wrap around the building and into the parking lot, but I think it's well worth the wait. Inside, the atmosphere is trendy, cool, and contemporary.

There was a line, but I don't think it's as bad a Voodoo's. The presentation of each donut looked magnificentÔøΩ?so I was excited to try some!ÔøΩ?\\nThe first thing that came to my mind was that they were a bit pricey. I didn't really want to spend a lot so I opted to get three flavors: Valrhona Chocolate Crunch, Chocolate Almond Ganache, and Raspberry Rosemary Buttermilk. I was actually really bummed that they ran out of the Creme Brulee the moment we got to the front of the line because that was one I really wanted to try. My favorite was the Chocolate Almond Ganache, because I love chocolate and thought it tasted great. I feel like my Valrhona Chocolate Crunch wasn't made fresh because it was cold when I took a bite of it. I still really liked it though. I feel like everything had a hint of lemon flavor in it, which I don't mind. But all of my friends mentioned that everything they got were too sweet for them. I honestly thought it was fine, but I have a pretty high tolerance for sweets hahaha. But maybe something to keep in mind for those reading this review.\\n\\nI like the unique flavors Blue Star offers and would definitely choose it over Voodoo's, although they are unique themselves.

If you're accustomed to Ethiopian restaurants where you eat in the traditional family style with entrees served on a big piece of injera, then you will be disappointed. Desta is a bit more \\"modern\\" in the sense that everyone gets their own entree with unlimited Injera to share. I got the Chicken tibs which was delicious. I went with a bunch of vegetarians who absolutely loved their vegetarian platter, and I have to say, I couldn't get enough of their Shiro. The standout for me though, was the Fish tibs my friend ordered. It was yummy pieces of tilapia marinated in spices and sauteed with onion, garlic, tomatoes and pepper.

Typical neighborhood joint where everybody has worked there since the civil war or in this case maybe when they forced mandatory bussing on Boston.\\n\\nYour not going here for the ambianc.  It's a family run Italian joint and I like that.\\n\\nI started with the BBQ Combo of Sausage and Steak Tips. Cooked on an open pit over coals on skewers like the sausage at Al's. It's served with a really good crusty Italian bread and cherry peppers.  The sausage looked good but was just barely ok if salted. It could have used a lot more herb and or spice. Next time I would pass on the sausage and try the lamb.  The steak tips were excellent. Charred outside and medium rare inside. A must try if you like steak.\\n\\nNow the pizza. I have never had Boston Pizza before.  It does deserve its own category.  Needless to say I didn't try the sausage.  I did try the pepperoni. A nice salty meaty blend and lots of it. Almost on par with Chicago pepperoni. \\n\\nThe crust is a crispy bottom with a dusting of corn meal and a light chewy crumb with a crust that turns yellow yet the crumb is not. It could be a corn oil crust but not as much as Chicago crust. It's also thicker than New York and thinner than Sicilian. Also thicker than Chicago thin but thinner and airier than Chicago pan.\\n\\nThe sauce is more crushed than thin but it's mostly under the cheese. They might cheese it, sauce it and then cheese it again. Then it's baked till the cheese just starts to burn. I like that.\\n\\nIt is a very good pizza and I would not be unhappy if it was the only pizza in town. I could eat it a few days a week if I didn't care about wearing my pants from last month.\\n\\nIf you are on a low carb no dairy diet or just like steak I would eat those steak tips often. \\n\\nThey have Pepsi Products and they only have pre sweetened tea.  \\n\\nI took uber back to to the hotel since I didn't have time to wait for the van.

Poor Lola had to make a grocery store run in the midst of lunch service, and left a sign on her door to please not leave. My lady friend and I couldn't oblige, and decided on burgers instead.\\n\\nHopdoddy does SO much right. There's a clear system for ordering and seating, the menu has great selections of not only burgers but lots of yummy beverage options to wash the burgers down with. The service is on point - friendly and efficient.  It was a crowded lunch rush, and when we walked in I didn't see many empty seats. While we were waiting in line, a cheerful lady asked us how many people were in our party of 2, and informed us that she would go reserve us a table and gave us the table number. After we ordered and paid, we found our number at a great table by the window. I think that's a very clever way of addressing what could be a chaotic seating situation.\\n\\nI got the Magic Shroom; lady friend got the Continental Club. Her burger looked beautiful! It's a turkey burger with provolone, bacon, arugula and pesto served up on a multi-seeded bun. It must have tasted as good as it looked, because she didn't so much as offer me a bite. The next time I darken Hopdoddy's door, I'm getting one! Next on my burger wish list is the Janis Joplin veggie burger. The Magic Shroom was divine, but the flavor WOW really came from the goat cheese and pesto. I didn't really taste the sauteed field mushrooms bringing much to the party in terms of flavor or texture. \\n\\nHopdoddy is now my 2nd favorite burger in Austin, and here's the good and bad of why.  The burger patty is ground in-house, and they're nice and thick but not so big you can't get a good bite (good). The texture and density tells me it's overly handled in the patty making process (not horribly so, but we're shooting for burger perfection here).  Also, the flavor is a bit bland.  If they would put half the salt they shower upon the fries onto the burger just prior to cooking, they'd taste amazing.  The buns are homemade, beautiful, and they stand up to the bevy of toppings - the perfect burger palette.\\n\\nWe also got a side of chili cheese fries that were nothing short of sinful.  The first thing that impressed me was that they serve the fries with the chili cheese on the side like a magical fondue.  This keeps the fries crispy to the last bite, which I appreciate!  Chili cheese fries always sound good, but then when you're half way through them the fries are soggy from the sauce. This is why I rarely order them.  The flavor of the chili cheese is delicious and unique - almost like there's a smidge of curry in there - something unexpected but delightful.  My only gripe is that I think the fries were over seasoned.  I tend to be in tune with how foods make my body feel, and the rest of the day I had a too-much-salt burn in my mouth and I was dehydrated.\\n\\nNice little bonuses: Condiment bar with house made sauces, and a variety of pickles.  There's a full bar, which I'm unable to comment upon due to the bun in my oven. However, I have a date with a boozed up milkshake sometime in the not too distant future!  Also, they sell packages of day old buns for $1.99."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was invited by a friend to make Hopdoddy Burger Bar our first stop on \\"Girl's night out\\".

Being a lover for Italian food, over the years, I have been to countless restaurants at Little Italy and I was dazzled every time by the quality and authenticity of the foods. Most restaurant retained their European atmosphere, small, cozy, and sometimes buzzing with enthusiastic staff with an open kitchen. Some of the best seafood, Italian joints, and bakeries famed in all of Boston can be found here, Neptune Oysters and Daily Catch, Giacomo's and Mamma Maria, Mike's Pastry and Modern Pastry.

I spent 6 wks in Peru last year, and have been wanting to try all things Peru since my return. First off, the rez I made was not noted when we arrived, even though i had 2 emails confirmations from them!?  We ordered the lomo saltado, ceviche, shrimp special and causa.  They were tasty for the most part, but THE saddest portions I have ever seen. Considering these are priced around what an entree would cost $13-16 a plate (yes, they did mention that the suggested way to order was a bunch of plates to share) but the sad little serving of ceviche was pathetic, considering most of it was taken up by corn.  Then the lomo saltado was made up of a few sad little pieces of beef and mostly french fries and onions to make the serving look big. Finally the causa was nothing like a traditional causa, with only one base layer of potato and some crab on top. Causa's tend to be made up of numerous layers...that's what makes them so tasty.\\n\\nAnyway, again, flavours lovely, but servings for the price?...not impressed. I will take going to visit the wholly authentic Mochikas on Pine St any day over returning to chicha again. Plus the server was so ill informed. He had no idea what was gluten free on the menu. Even after asking the chef (i think thats what he did when he disappeared to go and \\"ask\\"?) he still had no idea. And then when we asked for decaf tea options, he said green tea. We say, \\"umm, green tea has caffeine\\", he is totally surprised and says he had no idea.  Time to brush up on your menu skills please.\\n\\nPlease try Mochika's if you haven't yet.

It's small, yet has this great place, a Dunkin Donuts, and a pretty good CVS, and serves the East Dedham area with a place to get necessities, without driving to Dedham Square (which is only 1 minute away) or Providence Highway. The East Dedham Pizzeria may be a bit more expensive, than your average Domino's or Papa Gino's, yet the pizza is so much better, and truly Greek. The employees are all friendly, all Greek, and you can tell it's a true family business (which I enjoy supporting a lot of the times, instead of mega-chains, which are the same consistently). Everyone was friendly, the restaurant had a nice seating area, and was immaculate. Their menu consisted of SO many items, so many different pizzas they offer in addition to salads, sides, pasta, subs, burgers, calzones, and SO much more (literally, more items available at this small pizzeria that more and more of the restaurants I go to!).

The first time I went, my girlfriend and I met up with a friend who suggested it.  In short, the waitress took almost 20 minutes just to finally stop and ask us what we'd like to drink.  Then it took forever just to get a beer.  We didn't order food considering how long it took just to get a beer.  We never saw her again until we asked for the check.  Horrible service.  We paid, left no tip (not something I do except when given abysmal service), and even left a note.  We told ourselves we would never come back. \\n\\nFast forward to a year later.  A group of friends wanted us to meet up with them and where did they want to meet?  You guessed it.  With great hesitation we met up with them figuring it's more important to see our friends than worry about the restaurant.  When we arrived, our friends were already there, so we joined them.  Our server came right over, took our drink order and our 15 taster flights came right out.  He was super nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  He is the guy in the picture titled \\"Best Bartender in Portland\\" on one of the other reviews.  Again, we didn't try any food since we were just meeting for drinks but he did bring us a big thing of fries which we told him we didn't order.  He told us no worries and to enjoy them.

The restaurant is located on South Congress so you feel as if you are living the \\"Keep Austin Weird\\" campaign as you browse the surrounding neighborhood. This was my favorite aspect of the restaurant. \\n\\nThe awesome service comes second. The manager was 'floating' the scene assuring that all of his customers were being taken care of whilst never losing his smile. The bartenders were extremely helpful and friendly. Oooh that reminds me....their bar. There was a surprisingly somewhat extensive selection of beer on tap for a burger joint. Their bloody mary was also a trip! There is no just mixing bloody mary mix with some vodka. They put some blood, sweat and tears into them while they muddle the garlic cloves into the glass. The color of the drink was unusual as well; kind of a magenta, but tasted nothing short of a delicious Bloody.\\n\\nNow onto the food! One fun fact that separates this restaurant from the usual burger joint is that they grind their own meat, bake their own bread and use pure cane Dr. Pepper straight from Dublin, Texas. You don't think it could get any better?? Well it does! They even use Mexican Vanilla in their milkshake....mmmmm...it had that real vanilla bean flavor and I particularly don't enjoy a vanilla milkshake. But this one took the cake or should I say milkshake?\\n\\nTheir fries are deliciously seasoned and perfectly complimented by a chipotle ketchup. The burger selection is very creative and makes your mouth water just reading the menu. With names like the Magic Shroom or the Janis Joplin, complete with hemp seed veggie patty and sprouts, you have high expectations of the burgers' quality. Don't get me wrong, the burgers are very tasty just not the best ever. Burgers are a tricky thing to really conquer when it comes to the perfect amount of juiciness and taste. I believe that the patty is really the essence of the burger. A good burger can stand alone with just the patty and no help from the supplementary flavors of lettuce, tomato and onion. The Hopdoddy burger has a lot of help from the topping friends. The patty can't stand alone. But all in all it was one fun burger! I had the Magic Shroom with goat cheese and mushrooms. I enjoyed the creative compilation of ingredients, however the patty could stand to be a tad tastier."},{"name":"CafeNineteen","address":"265 18th St Nw","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"What can I say about CafeNineteen.

Great coffee, tea, mixed drinks, beer, you name it, they've got it.  \\n\\nThe food is just as awesome as the drinks.  Today I had a burger, but not just any burger, this burger was HUGE, and it came with sauteed mushrooms, bacon, egg (yes!  egg!), tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup and mayo.  Just the way I love it!  It comes served with a hearty portion of chips, and you're definitely going to need to cut it with a knife, unless of course you want burger juice down the front of your shirt.\\n\\nI chose the indoor seating in the back of the cafe, as it offers a great view of the customers coming into the cafe, along with a view of the people walking by outside.  There is outdoor seating as well, and if you're a people watcher (as I am), this is EXCELLENT real estate to take in the sights and sounds of Atlantic Station.  Nothing like a relaxing evening sitting back on the deck (that's what I'm calling it) of CafeNineteen enjoying the great food, greater service, and delectable drinks and desserts.\\n\\nIt has a special feel because on any day you can come in and the owner is working behind the counter, and he's a very friendly guy.

We got seated quickly, however, and ordered some fried green tomatoes with fried pickles to start. Wow, they were awesome! Fried dill spears are difficult to master, but this place has the best. The pickles had excellent flavor, but the breading was just bomb. The fried green tomatoes were definitely not a disappointment either, yum!!\\n\\nJake was our server and was very helpful in making tasty menu suggestions. I tried the chicken strip, the chicken breast, & the chicken leg. The breast was probably my fave with the chicken tender coming in at a close second. The chicken has a bit of a kick to it, but that's what makes it so perfect. The beans were fantastic and the macaroni was on point. We had a large order of fried okra to split and it was to die for, great breaking just like the fried pickles. \\n\\nJake suggested pie after, and this is a must. The coconut was probably the best, it's beyond amazing. Classic taste, so creamy and wonderful. I had the chocolate and it was life, like a perfectly undercooked brownie. \\n\\nWe will for sure be back, the service definitely was a display of awesome teamwork.

Their wine list is very robust AND there are about 20 wines that you can sample before you choose a bottle! Ask the waitress which ones you can try. You can get a buzz just off that ;) !\\n\\nTapas are crazy flavorful and every dish exceeded our standards. I would highly recommend the hanger steak with truffle butter, the dates wrapped in bacon, and the seafood paella!  Portions are bigger than most tapas place so you never feel shorted.\\n\\nAlso definitely try a charcuterie board.  They give you large blocks of cheese and plentiful amounts of meat. Get the prosciutto and the aged goat!\\n\\nWhat really made this last night special though was the service. Although it was crowded, Janelle and Jeffrey were very attentive and made us feel like we were the only customers that mattered. By the end of the night we were friends with Janelle! I'm serious. \\n\\nThe only dish that came out below average was the Churros which was strange because that's their #1 dessert.  We told them they tasted funny and the table next to us had the same problem. Our servers told the kitchen and gave us free tapas tokens for our next visit. \\n\\nOverall, I know that much of my happiness with this experience was due to my particular service, I assure you the food, wine and hip Spanish ambience is totally worth it!  \\n\\nWARNING: Book a WEEK in advance if you want a prime weekend time!

They're made fresh to order by an expert Chinese chef who spent years mastering his craft, and the texture of the noodles is like none other - firm yet smooth, but above all succulent. \\n\\nThe broth is also stellar. It isn't heavy but it does carry the flavor of fresh beef, which really complements the noodles. However, if you are averse to spiciness be sure to tell your waiter not to add the chili paste to the noodles. The chili paste is a great kick for flavor but simultaneously understandably intense for those who don't enjoy spiciness as much. \\n\\nThe beef itself is also of A+ quality. Never before have I had such tender and delightful beef with noodles, and I was surely impressed. \\n\\nIf you can't tell already, I definitely recommend the Hand-Pulled Beef Noodles (ÂÖ∞Â∑ûÁâõËÇâÊãâÈù¢).

Where you place your order and get your food is all the way in the back of the building, but, I must say, the line moved very quickly.  The burgers are HUGE.  My mother and I split one.  When I say huge, I mean thick, and loaded with all the fixin's you could want.  We got The Classic - beef, cheese, lettuce and tomato - and added an egg;  always a good choice.  We also got an order of the truffle fries, which, of course, just as they sound, were delightful.  I'm not one for super thick burgers, so that may be some of the great downfall of them for me, because the burger was not BAD, it just wasn't awesome either.  Do I feel it was a little overpriced?  Yes.  But that's SoCo for ya.  The person who took our order was very cool and friendly, but the waitstaff out on the floor left something to be desired.\\n\\nWould I go there again?

I indicated that I was not and they told me the restaurant closed early for a private party and that I couldn't go in. They gave me a $5 gift card as a way of apologizing for not letting me stay. I asked for a menu and they gave me one and I left. Then I went across the street and had ok pizza at More Home Slice.\\n\\nI returned the next evening (Wednesday) and slipped in right before they closed (at 10) and placed an order. I got the regular burger with fries. I try to eat kosher whenever possible, so this means no cheese on burgers, and definitely no pork. \\n\\nThe burger was pretty good. Not fabulous. I ordered it medium, and it arrived somewhere between medium and medium-well. Hardly any pink in the center. And there was one large piece of gristle in about the middle of the patty. Why so skimpy with the tomatoes? ONE tomato slice was all I got. Also, the menu said the burger came with mustard, but what arrived tasted fairly mayonnaise-y. Not bad, but also not expected. The fries were PERFECTLY seasoned. The only complaint I had about the fries is that about a third of them were small pieces sized 1\\" or smaller. And they were skinny. And crispy. Ok, that's about three complaints. But they tasted good. \\n\\nThey make their own chipotle (which so many people pronounce \\"chipolte\\"--what's up with that?) ketchup, which I'm betting is just Heinz ketchup mixed with ground chipotle peppers.

Few days ago while in Boston, my friend and I were craving Thai food so I went on yelp and came across white coconut Thai restaurant which was given a five star rating. After carefully learning the menu, reading some of the reviews, and looking at the pictures we decided it was worth a shot. The restaurant was small and clean at first glance. It was 5 PM on a Saturday and only one other group was being served aside from us. However as the night went by, it started getting busy. We start off with soup; I got the Tom Yum soup with shrimp (medium spicy). It tasted exactly like the original soup I had in Thailand. Then we had a sampler and noodles. When my friend started eating noodles, he pulled out a long piece of string which resembled the color of the noodles. We were eating it together, so my friend told me \\"STOP!!  Don't eat it.\\" Once I saw the string, I was about to throw up (sorry). My friend called the waiter over and very calmly explained the issue, showing him the string that was found. The waiter said sorry and ran away with the plate. We then saw him talking to the kitchen staff. I am really regretting not taking a picture, because it was truly disgusting and left me in shock. Later I left for the bathroom and when I returned the manager said sorry and handed the bill to my friend. The bill came out to $50. Honestly, I didn't understand how that was our total. Why did we have to pay them for trying to poison us? NEVER EVER go to this restaurant! They were lucky that we acted calmly and without any arguing."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've been here several times since moving to Austin.

I've brought lots of guests as well (where else do you bring out-of-towners but a burger joint?) and they've all loved it.\\n\\nI'm not really into truffle, but the queso fries are delicious and the traditional margaritas are perfect. \\n\\nAlso went with someone with celiacs and she said the place was good to eat at, but FWIW I watched the gluten-free burger bun fall apart in her hands within the first two bites.

People come up to you while you are in line and ask how many are in your party and they give you a number for your table.

I chose the three piece dark meat entree which came with two thighs, one drumstick, one slice of bread and your choice of two sides. I chose the potato salad and seasoned fries and the sides did not shine as bright as the chicken. Too bad I was only visiting Austin for a couple days because now I don't know how I'm going to back to Popeyes or KFC. If you're ever visiting Austin, make sure you squeeze in Gus's for a meal or two.\\n\\nFive stars for the food. The same goes for the service. Southern hospitality has been great. I wish I could bring some of it back to California with me. The servers were so delightful to be around, being awesome conversationalists.

Everything was super fresh and super tasty! There pretty much is always a line or wait but it moves pretty quickly. Thy seem to be a cross between fast food and a sitdown restaurant because you order in the back and then they do serve you at your table; bring you condiments and refill your drinks, all that. \\n\\nThey offer Maine Root soda which is super good, And they make a mean super strong Mai tai. I suggest the salted caramel milkshake and if you're gluten free they do have gluten free buns but I opted for no grains. The grass fed beef was worth the cost. Definitely a must stop while you're in Austin."},{"name":"Bauhaus Restaurant","address":"1st W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"At the time of this writing, there are no Michelin-starred restaurants in Vancouver. However, if there were, Bauhaus would easily qualify to be among them. Below are my ratings for food, service, and value. However, my Yelp rating is specifically for the food only.\\n\\nFood = 5.0 stars\\nService = 5.0 stars\\nValue = 4.0 stars\\n\\nFOOD:\\nI came here for dinner with 3 friends. To start, each of us were given a small complimentary dish of duck pate with a light apple backdrop. It was rich and delicious. A great preview of what was to come.\\n\\nWe began with the octopus appetizer, which included chorizo, purple potatoes, and endives. The octopus was quite meaty, yet tender and very flavorful. \\n\\nTwo of my friends ordered the dry-aged beef strip, which included onions, garlic, and smoked potato on a delicious bed of sauce. The beef was cooked rare (we were not asked how we preferred our meat to be cooked). I thought one member in our party would find it too \\"raw\\" (she always gets her meat cooked medium or medium-well), but surprisingly, she absolutely loved the dish. When I had a taste, it was tender, moist, and well-seasoned. And all items on the plate complemented the beef very well.\\n\\nAnother friend ordered the halibut, which included peas cooked 3 ways, fennel, and prawn bisque. Needless to say, she loved the halibut. The peas were cooked into a foam consistency, almost like a sponge cake. The bite or two I had was quite tasty. And the presentation was original. \\n\\nFor my dish, I chose the tasting menu. It included 6 items: prawns, spring vegetables, pork belly on a bed of house-made kimchi, sablefish, lamb, and white chocolate parfait. In short, the tasting menu was an experience to die for! I highly recommend it. Every item was superb, both as artwork and as a tongue-tantalizing meal. The only item I might suggest revising a bit is the spring vegetables, which was presented on a bed of curry and spices. Despite heavy mixing, as suggested by the server, the consistency was still a bit grainy, but overall, I really enjoyed the dish and the rich flavors. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nFrom beginning to end, the staff was very courteous and professional. We had a nice, brief conversation with a young British lad as he guided us to our table, which set the mood. He made us feel very warm and at home.\\n\\nThe owner also came out to greet us. In fact, he looks like he runs a very tight ship, and it shows because our experience was superb.\\n\\nVALUE:\\nI always hate rating the value of a restaurant because value is subjective. For consumers on a budget, Bauhaus may not be for you. For all that we had, it cost us over $344 (~$267 in USD). But would I return again? Absolutely, yes! It was a wonderful experience with great food and awesome service. If you're in Vancouver, it's well worth your time to dine at Bauhaus."},{"name":"Taqueria Las Palmas","address":"17254 SE McLoughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Maybe I've just discovered a lot of really great Mexican places, but I thought this spot was just okay. I walked in at 5:30 on a week night and all the employees were watching a telenovela (what is it about those that is so addicting??). \\n\\nI glanced at the menu board and quickly decided on the wet chicken burrito. They asked if I wanted traditional enchilada sauce or mole for an extra $1.50. When I asked if they could do green sauce, they quickly noted that they could. \\n\\nSince the place was empty, I had my choice of seat. Grabbing one of the booths, I settled in with my beverage and my book.

The salmon cebiche, a contemporary interpretation of a common south american dish, was the stand out plate of the night.

We were led up the stairs to a table for 2 in the front of the building so we could see everyone walking by on the path below. It turned out to be a good spot because I saw King Louis and Baloo leading people over to Asia and the gorgeous macaws from the bird show fly over. Our server Kayla was amazing. She gave us great recommendations and was very attentive to our table. We had a hard time deciding what to order. To drink I ordered an Everest Refresher: Sparkling Water with Cucumber, Passion Fruit, or Desert Pear Flavors. I went for the cucumber flavor and it tasted like I was drinking something, well...refreshing. Nice and light. My friend got a Shanghai Lemonade: Lemonade with the same flavor choices. She went with Desert Pear and she loved it. \\n\\nFor our entrees, I ordered the Tempura Shrimp: 8 Tempura Shrimp on long skewers, Chili plum sauce, jasmine rice, and stir-fried vegetables. I wasn't attempting to eat \\"healthy\\", it just happened that way. The presentation was everything. Arranging the shrimp skewers around the rice reminded me of a tee-pee.

Even R, who dislikes floral flavors said it wasn't strong. I love liege waffles, so chewy and warm. Reminds me of the time I ate them when I was traveling in Belgium. The paella was unique in that it used orzo (!). I grew up eating the Macau version of paella so this was a different taste. It didn't crisp on the bottom as the rice version but still delicious.

It was hot and stuffy on a less than 80 degree day but no air was circulating, maybe because the ceiling vests were caked with dust.

The meat is so tender and cooked perfectly, the chives and melted cheese add a perfect kick to the mashed potatoes, the arugula keeps the heavy sandwich not too heavy and to top it off the truffle oil is just divine. \\n\\nThe Regal Regis - A simple, yet filling sandwich. Meat is tender and cooked perfectly and the soy/balsamic/scallion sauce is simple and not overpowering. \\n\\nMexican Meatball Sub - If you're into spicy, definitely get this! The jalape√±o infused meatballs will tingle your tongue with pleasure but balance out perfectly with the pepper jack cheese and crusty baguette. \\n\\nThe Bristol - Not a fan of the sandwich -- it was a little bland. But, the side of arugula salad with parmesan in a lemon vinaigrette was so refreshing and goes perfectly with the heavy sandwiches here, I always make a special request to have this substituted as my side with whatever I order. \\n\\nDefinitely try the Onion Rings. But they are HUGE so I recommend getting the 'half portion' if you are with a party of 4 or more. The spicy creamy pink sauce it comes is so delicious and addicting. If your sandwich comes with a side of potatoes, see if you can get the Onion Ring sauce on the side. \\n\\nReservation highly recommended as this prime Boylston location is usually overcrowded with tourists and weekend shoppers.

It's a blast from the (distant) past - if you're not interested in that sort of thing go elsewhere!\\n\\nAnother thing it brings forward from the past is the service - just about the best of any restaurant I've been to.  The waitstaff is attentive but not intrusive, and very knowledgeable.  These are people who have made waiting on tables their career and it shows.\\n\\nThe food... over the years it's been up and down.  Never bad, but sometimes just so-so.  But for the past 3-4 years it's been really good - not quite 10/10 and maybe not *quite* enough to justify the high prices, but very good.\\n\\nLast night when my brother and I dined there, he started with the lobster stew and I with a Caesar salad.  Both were fantastic.  The salad greens were fresh and crispy, and the dressing wasn't a tweaked Italian like most these days, it was a good traditional Caesar with balanced flavors of garlic, egg, oil, and a hint of anchovy.  My brother liked the stew and it had large chunks of lobster in it.\\n\\nFor the main course, we both had the ribeye steak.  The portions were very generous, and the flavor and tenderness were on a par with Capitol Grille, which is my benchmark for a great steak.  I will admit that both were just slightly undercooked - we ordered medium-rare, and some parts of both were thoroughly red.\\n\\nFor sides, we both had the asparagus and liked it very much - the flavor was good and it was cooked perfectly.  I also had the pommes frites (aka french fries :^) ) which were very good.\\n\\nDessert for both of us (yes, we think alike) was the \\"soft chocolate cake with peppermint stick ice cream and whipped cream\\".  The portion size was a little small, but we were pretty stuffed from the rest of the meal anyway, and compared to other things on the menu it's relatively inexpensive.  And it was fantastic - we both really liked it.  The cake was very rich, and the ice cream was very peppermint-y.\\n\\nThe only negative thing I can really think of, and this is minor, was the bread supplied before the meal - two pieces of cranberry nut bread.  It was fine, but I'm not a big fan of cranberry nut bread - it would have been nice if they were a little more generous and supplied a couple of different kinds of bread.  If like many people I had a nut allergy I'd have been pretty upset.\\n\\nAnyhow, overall I'd give the experience 5 stars and the food 4.

Either way if you're going to dress like that stay in the kitchen and don't be visible to customers. Once he acknowledged us he oddly started counting money while simultaneously taking our order.

Sticky rice, lettuce, japanese mayo, sesame oil, gluten-free soy sauce, and maybe a little shredded nori for good measure -- a classic robin-dish if there ever were one.

It has all the quirky ambiance and awesome local flair that one would expect from a hip, vegan bakery, however the actual desserts fall extremely short.\\n\\n Many moons ago, I ordered a chocolate cake from Pattycake for my graduation party. My mouth was watering once I opened that pretty pink box to see a wonderfully decorated hunk of chocolate deliciousness. I had been hyping this cake to my friends all day but I was saddened to find that I couldn't even finish a small slice due to its over-rich and oily composition. The first bite of any of Pattycake's desserts is delectable, but upon further indulgence their cakes are far too dense and the excitement quickly turns to a tummyache.\\n\\nI've been into the store and sampled most, if not all, of their usual creations. The iced sugar cookies are nice, but again very oily! I brought some home to share, and after only 10 minutes or so the bag was covered in greasy patches. The cupcakes are usually far too large and somehow manage to be both crumbly and dense. The whoopie pies, again, are far too greasy.\\n\\nMy two favorite items on the menu are the cheesecake and buckeye bar. As an OSU student, I am constantly surrounded by delicious peanut butter and chocolate desserts that are far from vegan. Pattycake's buckeye bars are a cruelty-free alternative and they put most packaged buckeyes to shame.  As the for the raw cheesecake,  the taste is much lighter and more refreshing than their other desserts. I've found that a pair of these personal cheesecakes makes a great Valentine's day treat for you and your special sweetie :) \\n\\nAll and all, I feel like Pattycake's oiliness could be easily rectified. Vegan baking does not mean that extra oil need be used to compensate for the lack of eggs. Many vegan bakers use applesauce or mashed pear to get the same binding power but without the excess grease. Again, I would love to love Pattycake but until I can eat one of their cupcakes with out a pile of napkins for the oil, I'd rather go through the work of making my own."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I really am not sure if i am missing something here...i know i'm probably going to offend some die hard blue star fans but this is one of the most MEH donuts i've ever had.

I had the Tonkotsu ramen with classic thin noodles, standard noodle firmness, strong thickness of broth, a little lard, and Alot of spicy sauce. I added an egg. I LOVE that you can choose all of these particulars for your ramen. A helpful tip... the strong broth is thicker and a little more cloudy while the thin broth is more clear broth. I'm not sure what they do to it to change this but I liked the strong thick broth for ramen(clearly its not the lard since that is its own category).  The spicy sauce was not very spicy to me.. I probably should have gotten the Rekka ramen which is supposed to be ultra spicy but thats ok. The pork that came in the ramen was great and the egg was good as well. Service was good and I got my ramen fast! Another tip... the seats around the kitchen bar have removable tops that you can stuff all of your jackets, purses, etc. inside while you sit.

Overall, it was good food, but after one bite, I didn't eat the rest of the cabbage.\\n\\nAs far as atmosphere goes, it is close-quarters dining.  The restaurant is at capacity with tables and was very busy on a week night, so it felt crowded. There was about a foot between our table and the one next to us, and the location is noisy due to the busy, crowded atmosphere.\\n\\nIf asked, I would dine here again with a group of friends, but I probably wouldn't choose to go there if I were picking the restaurant location.

The waitress came once we were seated and took our order. I ordered a lemonade and it was quite refreshing. We then proceeded to order food. I ordered the humus platter, the Pin fries, and the chicken sandwich. The humus has a citrus flavor which my party did not care for so we sent that back. The pin fries came in ginormous proportion. It really is enough for 4 people to share. The chicken sandwich was delicious. \\n\\nNow on the bowling. The couches were a beautiful black leather with tufted features. I think the atmosphere made bowling even more fun lol. The only problem I had was the lanes were not oiled properly and for someone that is really trying to bowl correctly, it made for a challenge. It is also 35/hour so if you only have a few people on the lane, it can get quite expensive if you are bowling several games. That does not include shoe rental.\\n\\nWe played pin pong which made for great competition. That was probably my favorite activity of the night.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's not looking to leak away $70-100 a head on pure mediocrity. Being a fan of Flour, I was optimistic, but I think I'll stick to the sticky buns from now on.\\n\\nFirst, the service. After paying to park in a lot around the corner, we walk in to a packed Friday night crowd. Is there a rail spike lodged in your caboose, or are you just not that thrilled to fulfill our reservation? Guess I'll have to remember to buy a fake Rolex before trying out a place like this in the future. Having been seated elbow to elbow with a pregnant yuppie couple in a corner, we were attended to just once with water in the following half hour. \\n\\nFinally, we get some pork buns, and they are fine, nothing special. Perhaps it was a mistake to come here after being at the opening of Momofuku DC. The Indonesian fried rice was pretty good, but then for $17 it damn well better be. The real kicker were the Korean short ribs at $24.\\n\\nHonest question--what makes these Korean? Are you referring to the thinly sliced cut? Because ours came out dry as a sock with no sauce or seasoning to speak of. It was a real treat picking these up with my chopsticks and tearing the meat from the bone with my teeth like some alpine wolf. I'll bet these were a hit on friends and family night. Maybe the side of \\"cauliflower kimchi\\" makes this dish Korean, because F me right? I can only give the chef the benefit of the doubt by assuming that someone in the kitchen messed up big time to send them out like this. Unfortunately, even if I were the type to send something back, our server was too busy tickling the undercarriage of the upper class to check on us. Pretty disappointing considering this had been the lynchpin item of our dinner order.\\n\\nAs I implied earlier, it can be important when eating out to consider who a restaurant is for. By the end of our dinner at Myers + Chang, I was thoroughly convinced that I was out of place, in that this is really nothing more than a trendy watering hole for the South End business class. These people were seeking novelty and society more than quality food. It can be easy to assume that with high class comes high standards. Myers + Chang proves that in some cases, the truth can be just the opposite."},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Had breakfast here and YES it was good, and I would totally come back.

I feel like I should be a little bit more embarrassed by it, but truthfully, I'm not. My prime rib sandwich was one of the tastier things I've had in a while. Literally a massive hunk of seasoned and seared prime rib, laid atop a grilled baguette, and smothered in caramelized onions, it was served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and overly sweet gravy. Mother Hubbard up in Heaven, this was comfort food on steroids. The \\"sandwich\\" moniker was obviously a joke (I hope), as this bad boy was only to be tackled with a fork and knife. Or maybe a garden trowel, I have a big mouth. A few bites in and I knew that heart attack be damned, I'd be back for my new friend. Perfectly medium rare, melt in your mouth tender, with the smooth accompaniment of the onions, each mouthful made my smile wider until I realized that smiling and chewing at the same time was disgusting. Not so much for me, but the look on my dining companion's face let it be known that the \\"see-food\\" diet wasn't really her bag. And even though her steak and cheese looked like it had been regurgitated by a momma bird, she declared it the \\"best she'd ever had\\". Our waiter was nice enough, but was either really slow or really hungover. Either way it worked out in my favor, because a girl doesn't need a lot of interruptions while she gnaws on a pound of beef. \\n\\nOther trips have proven to be just as food favorable. The french onion soup is that heavenly blend of salty, oniony, cheesy bliss, all mixed up with some banging beef broth, great in a way that many other places can't seem to manage. The lobster mac and cheese is one of the better preparations of this increasingly popular dish, and the raspberry goat cheese salad makes eating light enjoyable. Stay away from the substandard lobster crab cakes, but if you have space for dessert, the warm chocolate cake is a must try. \\n\\nThe wait staff is increasingly 50/50 here. I've had the best waitress of my constantly eating out life here late one Monday night; she was genuinely friendly, above and beyond helpful, and most importantly, didn't rush us even though we had arrived a bit late for a presumably slow early week dinner shift.

It was good on its own.\\n\\nlemon meyer: i dont normally like lemon desserts, but this donut was amazing! i felt like it was Summer time in my mouth. The donut is cakey which i like. the lemon cream was light and airy. the lemon didn't overpower the donut. it was a light hint of lemon not too tart. and the powdered sugar just tops it all. I would definitely order this again.\\n\\napple fritters: this was a different take on apple fritters. The donut was not really a donut, it was rather hard. I almost want to say that this is a day old donut. inside was filled with apple bits but it just wasn't as good as I thought. the outer part of the donut was super hard, the glaze was hard. everything about this one is hard. the taste was okay, got the apple, cinnamon, sugary flavor - but because of the hardness of the donut, i didn't like it.\\n\\norange olive oil: surprisingly tasty. neither flavor overpowered each other. it's a very clean donut -- very light in taste. cakey donut. the orange and the olive oil balanced well.. i usually don't like a strong taste of orange in any of my food, especially sweets. But this one works! \\n\\nif you like cakey donut, this is your place to be!!"},{"name":"Mimi's Cafe","address":"12613 Galleria Cr","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"2.5","text":"I always enjoy going to the Mimi's at The Hill Country Galleria on 71W.

After having the leftovers the next day, my bf and I both had really bad stomach aches.

My two cents are basically that when it's all said and done, you're not really buying a donut, more of a small cake that's elegantly presented with top shelf ingredients.  No grease, no grime, just a well engineered piece of round donut love.  It's an artisan donut if ever there was one.  \\n\\nUpsides: Very clean, and excellent coffee to boot.  The quality of the products cannot be matched in Portland.  They take what they do seriously here, and rightly so.  They spare no expense into their ingredients, and give you what can only be described as a piece of art.\\n\\nDownsides: A little pricey, but you expect that.  Not exactly a 'dirty dozen in the pink box' sort of place.  Staff can be a little on the snobby side, but if you are dropping $5-6 for a donut and coffee regularly, you probably drive an Audi, wear your sunglasses indoors, and have pressed jeans.  You know that guy at work that you call an ass clown behind his back.  That's you!  Expect a little snobbiness in the Peal.\\n\\nOn my visit, we tried four kinds, all various fruit fillings.  Lemon is sublime!  We also had a minor celebrity sighting.  Nothing like watching Dwight Jaynes dropping a ten spot on 4 round rings and watching them disappear faster than a five minute shopping spree at a toy store.  Kid in a candy shop I tell ya, it was amazing!\\n\\nNote: You may like certain things, but they have different offerings daily, so it's rare to see the same thing twice unless you go regularly.

Dude working was super helpful and patient with me even though the look on my face was probably shouting \\"EW WHY AM I HERE.\\"  Apparently the orange was a special thing and the blueberry was a solid standard. Ok. Well, let's do it. One of each. The simple glazed girl is getting wild today. \\n\\nI sat down to take a bite of orange first (just because it was on top) and HOLY COW.

Mistake. This place was PACKED. There was about a 30-45 minute wait. \\n\\n(Edit: Manager informs me that you can call ahead about 30mins ahead of when you plan to arrive to be placed on the waiting list. So by the time you get there you'll be almost ready to be seated. But no reservations. Another example of their great service) \\n\\nBut...I loved this place. The decor and atmosphere was great. Huge bar, lots of energy, lots of seating. The bar had a good selection of cocktails, wine, and beer.\\n\\nI started with the Guacamole, plantains, and grilled corn. The guacamole was freshly made and delicious. The plantains were surprisingly good; they weren't too firm and perfectly caramelized. The grilled corn was a big highlight of my meal; the spices and cheese on the corn just made it so much more than a regular piece of corn.\\n\\nMy friends and I had several of their taco selections:\\nSeasame Ribeye\\nFried Oyster\\nBaja Fish (fried fish)\\nVeracruz Fish (grilled fish)\\nCurry Shrimp\\n\\nAll are made with 1 corn tortillas which were nice and thick and wasn't too overpowering in taste. All of the tacos are really good. If I had to chose my two favorites I would say the ribeye and veracruz.\\n\\nOur server was really good, but our first order of tacos came out a little slow. But when they came out they weren't cold, so I can only assume they were cooking a fresh batch of everything.\\n\\nMy only thing is I felt some of the tacos were slightly too expensive for the amount of food you got. My friends left a little hungry and didn't think it would be wise spending more money. \\n\\nI'd definitely come back though. Loved the vibe. Food was good all around.

The refills kept coming which is nice and the bill was cheap but if you are looking for taste or quality food, you will want to look elsewhere in the area. I think this place is more ideal in a suburban mall setting than in the Short North as it stands and unless their game is stepped up, it is likely to flop within two years in this location.

I wasn't sure what it was, so looked it up and saw that it was a new burger restaurant. \\n\\nI've always enjoyed a good burger and definitely wanted to try it and get my black Angus on!  So, tonight was the night!  My experience exceeded my expectations.  I walked in not knowing what to expect. \\n\\nThe host greeted me immediately to welcome me to HopDoddy and gave me the menu.  He then said that I would go to the back to order and pay, then choose a seat in the restaurant and the food would be brought out.  I asked the smiling, sweet, friendly girl taking my order, \\"What is your favorite burger?\\"  She told me and I said, \\"I'll take that!\\"  She handed me a number and said to place it on the hanger at the table and the food will be out shortly.\\n\\nI got my drink from their fountain machine, and it was Maine Root Cola - so refreshing.  Everything they use is eco-friendly (cups, utensils, ramekins), and they had the recycling section to place your trash.  Love that.\\n\\nNow, the decor is perfect and trendy, without going overboard.  Great glass doors with metal, square handles when you walk in.  A central bar with perfect lighting.  Tall booths and great artwork displayed on the brick walls.  Loved it. \\n\\nThey brought the burger and fries out on this metal tray lined with paper, with a gorgeous burger and side of fries.  It looked incredible.  I couldn't wait to take a bite.  After taking my first bite of my Magic Shroom burger (In house, homemade bun, Angus Beef, Goat Cheese, organic field mushrooms, topped with a basil peso spread), I felt like a vampire taking their first bite of an unassuming victim.  So GOOD! \\n\\nFor those you that do not eat beef, they do have a Veggie or Turkey burger, so there's something for everyone.\\n\\nI enjoyed every bit of it and even shared with my friend, who got the Ahi Tuna burger.  Both were great and the portions perfect.  The burgers range from $6 - $9, and a side of fries is $2.  Drinks are $2, so expect to spend about 10 - 12 bucks total.  It's more than you would pay at Frans, but less than Fuddruckers.  \\n\\nOverall - two thumbs up.  If I was cool and had 3 thumbs, it would be three thumbs up! Also, they do have a full bar for those of you that want to have a cold beer or mixed drink with your meal.\\n\\nThis is a welcome addition to the SoCo area, and have been open since October 13th.  Be sure to stop by this new delight of a restaurant to welcome them, and let your stomach enjoy a delicious burger in the process.\\n\\nThanks HopDoddy for a tasty meal, great service by the staff, and great atmosphere.

The only saving grace to this is that it goes by the bar and we were able to grab a drink to help with the stomach pangs.  And while they do take to-go orders, you still have to wait in the extremely long line.

Aren't they usually soul-LESS places?  \\n\\nThe problems with this place begin with its name and tagline, which perfectly sums up the contradictions present in every aspect of the establishment, from decor, to the ordering experience, or lack thereof.  \\n\\nCoffee and food seem adequate; however, be aware that they use light roast beans, which creates a smoother, \\"blander\\" (for lack of a better word) flavor.  Their home-made pop-tarts are sinful treats, and the biggie salad, which I had the pleasure of sampling for free, is really delicious.  \\n\\nBut...... the decor is really trying hard to be both chic and yet inviting, and doesn't pull either off very well.  A huge poster at the counter proclaims \\"Sorry, this is a laptop-free zone,\\" and the stated ethic of the establishment is that they want the place to be where people come to meet and interact with each other.  \\n\\nAnd yet..... Orders are placed on an iPad at the counter, without much interaction with the staff, by flipping through and selecting menu choices.  You can put your number in to be texted when your order is ready.  So even though the cafe doesn't want you to open that laptop, you'll be interacting with electronic devices throughout your visit--it's built in to the ordering experience.  But those devices won't be your own, unless you decide, as some customers had during my visit, that the \\"no laptops\\" rule didn't apply to them.  \\n\\nNO LAPTOPS!  WE WANT YOU TO INTERACT, only, not with us.  \\n\\nSee what I mean about contradictions?  \\n\\nThe decor is pleasant enough, but the hanging platform chairs seem a bizarre choice--and one is already out of commission and can't be sat in at the moment.  \\n\\nOn the whole, The Factory is a pleasant, if slightly bizarre place, with some really good food choices, and I'm guessing it won't be long before they drop this \\"no laptop\\" thing.

Like literally I couldn't sense  even the slightest bit of seasoning. If they improve that then absolutely it would be worth coming back for. However I could get better chicken at Popeyes or KFC for less.

My personal favorite is the Butcher's, although I'll be trying the Earth + Turf next time.  The fried okra (not on the menu anymore) was outstanding, but it's been replaced by equally good fried pickles.  Last but not least, definitely try a milkshake.  The Toasted Marshmellow is delicious, but all newbies need to get the Krispie Kreme shake. Mmm...\\n\\nService:\\nThe wait staff is pretty on point.  The line to get in can be long on weekends, but it's not intolerable.

True for most things. \\n\\nThe Vibe: Morning movers and shakers, groovers and fakers. Come as a solo act and you will be paired with another ala carte diner. That could be a grand adventure or a reason to wear that Misanthrope T-Shirt with pride. \\n\\nThe tables are elbow close so you get to hear who got stiffed out of a commission by another or who got caught in the commission of an act with another. \\n\\nThe Staff: Exuberantly friendly even though you haven't even had your first latte.\\n\\nI had my first latte. a Raspberry Caramel soulful bowlful of caffeine. I was jumpin' and pumpin' before the food came and long into my nap time. \\n\\nThe Food: Definitely North African with a Middle Eastern edge to it. Bold, decisive flavors carefully cooked and pleasingly presented. Not for the timid devotees of Cracker Barrel cuisine. This is stand up in your belly and be counted great grub. Also, there is a gas fed fired oven for making flat breads from scratch and soon you will be scratching something that used to be flat...like your tummy.    \\n\\nThe Cassoulet was long simmered and tomato-y. Cannellini Beans as a base line, punctuated with slivered Scallions, two cackle berries (eggs up) fresh from the nest, a baby shoe sized slab of thick smoked Bacon, Andouille Sausage, Saucisson Parisienne a L'ail (French Country Garlic Sausage), Red Wine and Tomatoes. A Tunisian fusion stew, Son, with a house made fat slice of Sour Dough Focaccia for sopping and mopping. Roll up your sleeves and tighten your bibb for this.    \\n\\nLes Boulette.

Jimmy Hula's however, has come very very close to dethroning the title for me.\\n\\nOf course, you may think 'another taco place'? and I might say 'Tijuana Flats', but those are both unfair things to say in the face of Jimmy Hula's.  Jimmy's is just different, with some interesting fusion flavors (Pulled pork with MAC N CHEESE topping on a taco? OMG YES!).  Whereas TF offers outstanding traditional flavors, Jimmy Hula's blows your mind with unconventional tacos, like teriyaki tacos and buffalo chicken tacos.   The adventurous flavors also carry over to their burgers... like a teriyaki burger with pineapple... or the burger that has slices of roast pork and ham as well,\\n\\nI have also joked (though not really a joke) that I always wish taco places sold French fries...well Jimmy Hula's not only has that covered, but take it to the next level with a variety of flavors, and offering tater tots as well!\\n\\nThe flip side is  that ALL Jimmy's basically has are burgers and soft shell tacos.  They do have a couple of other sandwiches and the rice bowls... but if you're thinking you want a burrito, or you want one hard shell taco and one soft shell, that kind of variety would not be found here.\\n\\nSo choosing between a place like Jimmy Hula's and a place like Tijuana Flats isn't so much about which has the better taco, but what is the variation you're looking for? For more traditional fair offered in a variety of formats (burritos, tacos, quesadillas, etc), something like TJ is a better choice.  But if you're looking for a variety of flavor and want to mix it up, Jimmy Hulas is definitely worth checking out.\\n\\nPrice point wise, this is typical for fast casual.  $4 for a taco isn't so bad because most people can only down about 2.  Big eaters (and don't be embarrassed, you know who you are) will ALWAYS complain.  Like my co-worker who complains he spends $18 at Five Guys.

But the service was challenging. Even after we had spent over $600 as a group at the bar, we couldn't get a bartender to pay attention to us when we wanted to re-order. I'm talking good 10-minute waits of trying to frantically wave at people, and it wasn't that massively crowded in there (there were maybe, aside from my group of around 20, another 20-30 people in the restaurant).\\n\\nThe other negative is that you can't leave your car parked in the Town parking lot overnight. If you're tipsy, this puts you in a bad situation of either having to drive home or get towed. This isn't \\"There\\"'s fault, but it would be nice to see some alternatives.\\n\\nAll in all, the drinks were good and the atmosphere was decent, but I probably won't be back unless I'm going with a group or the food prices are lowered.

We're in our early 30's and got carded, and I said something \\"wow we haven't got carded in so long!\\" Emotionless stare from her... So this continued throughout the entire meal. No smile, no expressions, it was quite strange. When we wanted dessert at the end, the ice cream sundae only came in 1 scoop or 5 scoop, so we asked can they do anything in between. She sternly said \\"no\\". We just ended up ordering 2 of the smaller ones but she could have suggested that?\\n\\nAnyways, on to the food. M&C is a reminder of why I generally don't like Asian fusion. Most dishes don't get \\"fused\\" or twisted in a better direction.

But I can find similar ones for a third of the price...\\n\\nBraised Pork Belly Buns - Could have been really good. The fat part was well rendered but the meat was not tender enough for me. The ones at Pabu are almost the same but much much better.\\n\\nCod + Chorizo Fried Rice - Could find the chorizo pieces, but the cod gets completely lost in the salty mix and I'm sure didn't add much to the flavors of the dish overall.\\n\\nGrilled Duck Kebabs - $15 for 4 small pieces of duck is definitely overpriced. The meat itself was tender enough though.\\n\\nHot Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles - Most disappointing dish. It was way too oily. While it got the spice, it didn't have the \\"aroma\\" of the traditional dish. \\n\\nSo overall, mediocre food, overly salty, over priced.

Now, I've had plenty of grits in my day, and my home state of VA is no stranger to southern food.  Heck, if you go up to Philadelphia they consider VA part of the deep south.  But none of those grits I've ever had in my life have compared to the cheese grits I had at Babette's.  For starters, apparently southerners use thick grained grits and I'm now a convert.  Within one bite of the cheese grits here I felt like I had been shot with a tranquilizer dart and suddenly felt warm and relaxed, and at peace with the world.  I could really get used to eating like this, though that one taste has now ruined me for life.  If food can turn you on, these grits did just that to me.  Maybe these are just how grits taste, and people that grew up with food like this wouldn't find them noteworthy.  But, they opened my eyes and I'll forever remember that culinary moment.\\n\\nNow, the grits are just a side item here, but the main entrees were fantastic as well!  We came for brunch, and the menu was wonderful and really hard to make a decision.  I ordered the Babette's Benedict which was grilled texas brioche, flank steak, and a poached egg with hollandaise.  Absolutely awesome.  Great grilled flavor, light but savory hollandaise, and very tender steak.  And the presentation was a work of art.  Hard to believe it was only $15, but very filling.\\n\\nI sampled my dining companions' berry pancakes and banana waffles and everything was outstanding.  Mine was the most expensive dish of the three, with almost every other brunch entree costing around $10.

To keep this brief, I'll cover some key points: \\n\\n1) AMBIANCE: The view is spectacular, but the approach to the restaurant was a little off-putting. As you walk up, you are directly in front of their kitchen entrance, complete with stacks of dirty dishes and harried employees. You have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the restaurant which is nice, but it overlooks the HUGE outdoor bar area, and the noise can be a bit intense.\\n\\n2) SERVICE: Easily the worst part of our meal. The hostess was rude and annoyed, and she also ran food, so we had to see her throughout the evening. Her mood didn't improve to say the least. Our waiter was completely inattentive--we had to ask to order and for the check. Just ugh. \\n\\n3) FOOD: We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which was either overcooked or frozen--in either case, it was chewy (absolutely inexcusable for a Boston seafood restaurant!). But the main courses were absolutely exquisite--it was really fine dining. I was completely surprised. I also had a great dessert! \\n\\n4) DRINKS: You might be wondering why I'm giving this restaurant an ok review, and I think it was because their drinks were incredibly strong and tasty. I was in a very good mood by the end of the evening. I can see why this is a popular bar!\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend that you go here for the outdoor bar area and the spectacular view of Boston at sunset.

I got the Double D and the first bite was pretty good, I really liked it. The doughnut was fresh out of the deep fryer and the angus beef patty was delicious. The blue cheese was pretty strong, which I like but it took away from the other sauces and bacon, which I could hardly taste. It was just too much going on at the same time, without the balanced harmony you normally would have when just plain buns are used, since the doughnuts call for most of your attention. Wished there were more vegetables in the burger to cut the greasiness of the doughnuts. We also got the fried okra which was amaze balls, it helped wash the burger down. The side of homemade chips are also pretty darn good.\\n\\nFor dessert I got the Dirty Harry and they were doughnut holes which surprised me, since it wasn't mentioned obviously in the description, the chocolate fudge they use is phenomenal. \\n\\nEven coming here on an empty stomach, I couldn't finish my food, I didn't eat a little over half of the two doughnuts of the burger and had to take home a majority of the dessert.\\n\\nAll in all not a bad place but definitely hyped up and a novelty joint. The entire time eating the burger I was thinking how the only reason it's popular is because it's a cool idea, basically the combination of two popular unhealthy foods into one.

We really wanted to get veggies in our meal to balance out all that we ate on this Boston trip, but the \\"vegetarian\\" menu doesn't actually have very many options that are full veggie dishes like you'd expect at a Chinese restaurant. So we got the ginger scallion bok choy--really good, but dang did I really pay $9 for this? We got the dan dan noodles cold, and they were pretty spicy but also didn't wow me. Again, I paid $9 for that. We also got the braised pork belly buns, which were presented so beautifully but definitely too salty.

The music was so low you could barely hear it and once the crowd popped in you couldn't hear it at all. We ordered dinner, I had a half rack of ribs with a baked potato and cornbread. While the drinking is on par the food, given that this is a southern style spot swimming in the vain of everything Texas, was mediocre. My ribs were cool and arrived dry with no option of BBQ sauce, my potato wasn't hot enough to melt any of the cheese and while cornbread rocked it came with a tiny ramekin of whipped butter soaking in about a quarter ounce of whiskey honey. It was barely enough to flavor one piece. I'll say there's no such thing as bad BBQ and we were both members of the clean plate club on this Sunday night but it's not the food or atmosphere that'll bring us back. We'll be back because they offer every single spirit from High West however priced at $18 a shot... All and all, as I watch my favorite city slowly drift in to this pseudo corporate style sea of establishments our visit wasn't bad at all nor something to write home about."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The food was delicious, however the $10 margaritas had way too much ice.

Also best bacon I have ever had and my husband had the homemade sausage which he stated was the best sausage ever. The coffee cake was definitely worth the extra caloric splurge, super moist and not overly sweet. They had great gluten free options on the menu and fun kids menu items like the babica balls. The only small complaint I have is that the waitress was not accommodating or helpful with our groups dietary restrictions. My husband is paleo and our friend is vegan/gluten free. I know this makes it complicated but she could have been more understanding or given us some options. She seemed to imply that there were no substitutions allowed until\\nwe requested she check with the chefs.

We never had one before, although along Brighton Ave. in Allston there are some, and there have been others since the 1970s.\\n\\nNot of Indian descent, I have prepared mostly vegetarian north Indian food for over fifty years, learning from college friends who would sometimes share a little of their \\"care packages\\" sent by families--seasonings once unavailable in most of the U.S.\\n\\nSince I did not spend childhood in India, my tastes are not \\"baked in\\"--favoring some one \\"true\\" approach. Nevertheless, it's hard not to prefer what one experienced first: upper-class Hindu styles from Ahmedabad of the 1950s. Punjabi Indian still tastes a bit luxurious--more fat and less bean, grain and pickle.\\n\\nFor lunch buffet, I found a mix of vegetarian and meat dishes, including tandoori chicken. The first reaction from a veteran of Indian cooking is certain to be: where's the heat? By Indian standards, almost everything was surprisingly underseasoned. That probably accounts for some critical reviews saying, in effect, \\"I'm Indian, and this food was not.\\"\\n\\nOutside \\"little India\\" enclaves like the one in Waltham, one has to be tolerant, since even some veterans of Indian cooking don't warm up to \\"India hot.\\" There will usually be a spicy condiment available to compensate, often onion relish. At Shan-a-Punjab, unfortunately, the onion relish was much too mild to help. However, the mixed pickles were the real articles and a genuine treat, including even vadu mango.\\n\\nBecause of the mild seasoning, one could easily tell that the vegetarian dishes were fresh and carefully prepared. Aloo chana was underdone; it needed perhaps another half hour and might have been better with desi rather than kabuli chana and with more cilantro. Dal appeared to be urad: unusual except as a base for papad.\\n\\nThere were small vegetable pakoras. Samber (more often \\"sambar\\")--the soup of the day--was exceptionally fragrant, with a mix of herbs, cumin, fenugreek, tamarind and apparently black pepper. It was the one dish among the buffet notably associated with south India. The dinner menu offers dosas.\\n\\nShan-a-Punjab has a classic location for a dhaba: a gas station since the 1920s, Tommy Ferris Texaco since the 1960s, next a B'Good burger palace about eight years ago and then Cognac Bistro until last year. The service bay door was preserved as an artifact through Cognac but now has been replaced with a large window. The mostly pale green decor is modest, by upscale restaurant standards, but elegant for a dhaba.\\n\\nA key problem trying to run any kind of full-service food at this location is the small amount of daytime business nearby. Regulars it might attract in Kenmore Square or even in Coolidge Corner aren't around and probably won't go so far. Take-out has to be a key to success. From gas-station days, Shan-a-Punjab has a small parking area with a wrap-around auto lane that might be of help."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"While the migas here are passable, the vast majority of the food is unpleasant in one way or another.

The food takes a long time, which is hard to ignore when the whole front of the building is a giant window. I can see you screwing around, El Chilito employees.

The powdered orange olive oil was unique and absolutely stunning and delicious (I'd get again for sure!) The PB&J was an outstanding product and one of the best PB&Js I've ever had -- the spicy jelly was fabulous!

The space opened from indoor to outdoor seamlessly.  All we needed now was a beach.  \\n\\nTo order, one fills out the order card which has their list of menu items and prices, and then places the completed order card in a holder that indicates to the wait staff that you are ready.  A blue card (provided at the table) being placed in the holder indicates to the wait staff that you require assistance.  I like this system - something I've seen only one other time in my life (at a Mexican restaurant chain in Houston, TX that I frequented in my childhood).  I honestly don't know why other restaurants haven't adopted this convenient system.  \\n\\nSo, we ordered a couple drinks (a mojito and port chester reviver), guacamole and assorted gorditas for our starters, grilled corn, and four tacos - chicken, spicy chorizo, portobello, and sesame ribeye.  While I understand that Bartaco does Mexican food in a \\"tapas style\\", I still couldn't help but feel let down by the puny portion sizes (especially when one considers these portion sizes relative to price).  \\n\\nThe assorted gorditas (cheese and pork), though very tasty - especially with the accompanying cilantro-aioli (described as such by our waiter) were smaller than chicken nuggets.  I couldn't justify paying $4 for four puny gorditas ever again.  The same goes for the guacamole - $5 for a small portion of average tasting guacamole and a limited number of chips isn't gonna cut it for me.  The corn however - topped with cotija cheese, lime juice, and cayenne - was worth every penny.  My wife proclaimed that this was quite possibly the best \\"veggie\\" side she has ever had.  I have to admit, it was the best tasting corn dish I've ever had.  The tacos, also puny in size were pretty tasty - believe it or not, the chicken actually ended up being my favorite of the four tacos we ordered.  \\n\\nAfter spending roughly $50 (albeit including drinks), we were still not full so we hit up the food truck park to finish the job."},{"name":"Dagabi Cucina","address":"3970 N Broadway St, Ste 101","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Lovely neighborhood restaurant.

We both got chicken parmesan.  The chicken was not dry and the sauce was good, but it was served with chopped up tomatoes next to the sauce, which tasted great (they were sweet and we like that), but those chopped up tomatoes on the plate were cold.  Not sure why, it took quite some time to get our food.  They really squeeze you in here, the next table is \\"right there\\".  They have a lot of wasted space where they could spread it out more, but overall it was a good experience. The restaurant is not loud and not full of kids, which is appealing.

Even more so because the waitress did not explain anything to us about ordering. After some observing we realized that much like a sushi place you pencil in on the sheet what you want. The menu they give you is a guide. I say scratch the menu and just use the paper we are to order on!  Or keep the menu and scratch the paper.

The concept of the tray is cool but just overdone...or we just needed to space each item out! I am still scratching my head about this one. The tamales were good not excellent, quac was fresh and flavorful. I only liked one of the four tacos. I met very few tacos I don't like but did not even finish the other three.

I mean maybe I just came in at the wrong time or the wrong day or something but going there pretty much just sucked. I realize that I am in the complete wrong demographic. Big City has not been designed to cater to fags in their later twenties. And I will admit that I do have somewhat of a bias against college bars in Allston. I do on occasion visit these places and I almost always enjoy myself but this place was an exception to that rule.  \\nThe first thing that really irritated me about this place isn't really their fault. I guess they do not have a full liquor license there and so they can only serve certain drinks and whiskey is not one of them. It did take me a while to recover from the shock. Evidently they did not receive the memo that my weekends are completely fueled by bourbon! And while I was thrown off my game I ended up agreeing to the waitress suggestion and getting so horribly fruit cocktail. I might be gay but I am certainly not fruity cocktail gay.\\nMy second gripe is that the service was so completely horrible. Actually, I am not even sure if that is the right word. Can something that is barely non-existant be labeled horrible? I mean I couldn't for a minute understand. It wasn't crowded. The place was empty, hell is was barren. It was 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon and I wanted more than a few cocktails with my friends but that plan failed miserably. We were in there for like two and a half hours and we each only had three drinks and a meal. Then when I walked away from the table briefly to use the bathroom, she took the remains of my margarita and put down the check because her shift was done. And, of course, we couldn't get any attention from the new waitress for more drinks so we ended up leaving. \\nThe bartender also kept coming over to flirt with my two friends. Hey, that's cool. I have no problem with that at all but he just kept doing it ad naseum and didn't even pretend to talk to me. I am aware of I am the token gay at the table but can you at least be polite. I guarantee it will get you further with my friends.                    \\nI do have to say that the steak tips were rather tasted. They were cooked to order with a very nice marinade and the fries were golden and crispy. I also tasted each of my friend's food and I found that to also be good.

First of all, everything about this place is very efficient. Even thought there is a huge line before you order, you don't really have to wait. Very organized. \\n\\nEven though this is a burger place, it's has a vegan option (a hemp seed veggie pattie). If you are not into red meat, there are turkey burgers and an Ahi tuna burger. This is the kind of place where you can take just about anyone. \\n\\nTheir burgers are wonderful. My husband had The Goodnight. It's very spicy since it has some fresh jalape√±o slices in it, but it did add great texture on the burger.  I had the Greek burger. If you love lamb, you will love this burger.

The restaurant is really pretty. Good music and ambience, they have that down perfectly. It's really well designed and in a nice area. Our waitress was really nice and friendly. After chatting with her about the menu she suggested the pad thai modified, which I got, and my friend got the cashew chicken.\\n\\nOur orders took the perfect amount of time to arrive, about 10/15 minutes. The presentation is lovely. Sadly, for me, the food was only okay. My pad thai was quite lacking in flavour, the noodles were rather gluey and the vegetables were minimal, a bit more vege-wise would have gone a long way to make this taste better. I know I got it modified (and that it can affect the taste) but there was nothing to make up for the prawns that had been taken out. It was sweet and sour but also bland and the tofu was really minimal. Filling up on rice noodles isn't ideal and for the price I expected more.\\n\\nMy friend did not like her dish either, and I don't think it was what she was expecting. It has a lot of chilli in it and for a stirfry I think she expected more sauce. It was covered with chilli, and was so spicy still that she had trouble eating it. She ended up not being able to eat most of the dish, and I wasn't able to find it on the online menu to check but I didn't recall it stating that it has chilli.\\n\\nAll this said, our waitress was great and the service was flawless. She noted my friend picking out parts off her plate and offered to get her another dish (she declined this kind offer). The waitress followed up later and asked how she was doing, and made sure my friend was doing okay. Then she gave us this nice complimentary dessert, which we both enjoyed, and it took some of the spice out of my friend's mouth. The bill was prompt and she came back quickly and she definitely made the experience far more pleasant for us.\\n\\nTo be honest, I am quite sure how to rate my experience, 3 seems too low considering the service and the space, but 4 seems too high to rate a place that I probably wouldn't pick to go to again. If I ever do go back I would make sure I ordered something completely different.

Not only that, but she asked us a few questions about our personal preferences when it came to food (sweet, savory, sour, etc) and was able to suggest specific menu items that would cater to our tastes. Wait...\\n\\nYou love the food at the place that employs you AND you can personalize the menu to fit my tastes???\\n\\nYep. She was a rockstar.\\n\\nMy friend decided on the lemon marscapone pancakes after hearing me rave about them for the past two weeks (this date was a long time in the making) and I went with the fig and brie panini (it's been on my hit list since my first visit). We also ordered an Early Grey tea and the Bohemian coffee (it's the best!). My friend received her own teapot AND her mug was tempered--she was very impressed. \\n\\nThe food...oh, the food. My friend ate every last bite of her plate and couldnt' stop raving about how the last bite was every bit as good as the first. My panini was a creamy slice of heaven served with a side of chips. We both enjoyed our meals very much. About halfway through I remembered their complimentary (and bottomless!) mimosas on the weekends so I ordered one. \\n\\nWe ended up closing the place down. The weather was so perfect, the conversation was awesome, and they brought us out two cupcakes on the house (score!). The cupcakes were fabulous, too. The carrot cake was perfectly spiced and the chocolate frosting on the chocolate cupcake was not overly sweet and you could taste the real cocoa in it. They were perfect. \\n\\nI ordered a slice of their Amaretto cake to go to take home to my roommates. No one's tried it just yet, though. \\n\\nGreat food and excellent service? La Mongerie is back in my good graces. 5 stars for you!"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I had the lamb meatballs. They were fantastic.

All I experienced was a failed attempt to highlight what the place was all about---the donut. \\n\\nTo be honest, the idea of a juicy burger with bacon and cheese between sweet, delicious donut buns sounded like it was going to be a party in my mouth. Sadly, I was disappointed. \\n\\nThe buns are not sweet at all. I was expecting a glazed donut to compliment the savory taste of my patty. Basically it was bread with a hole in the middle. The patty, bacon and cheese had amazing flavor. Unfortunately, the whole burger fell short where it should have been a winner---the donut bun. \\n\\nI did try a desert donut which was at the recommendation of the waitress. The blackberry jam was slopped on and overpowered the actual donut. All I tasted was the blackberry jam. I think had they put a small teaspoon or two of the jam, it would have been the perfect dessert. Again, the donut was not the star in this plate either. \\n\\nWould I recommend Gourdough's?

Wow, as slow as it was that was irritating, and the coffee was weak and horrible. I ordered the most simple breakfast; scrambled eggs, bacon, toast. Other people in our group ordered more elaborate specialty entrees. So mine comes first. The others took a while, eating alone in front of everyone is always awkward so there was that. To add the eggs were ice cold from the start, the toast not buttered and no butter, jam or other for anyone's toast was ever brought to the table. Second bite of eggs had a hair in it. I was done at that point. A couple other people in our party really liked the food. Maybe I just got the wrong thing, but in my opinion if the simplest of breakfast is a mess, I'm not going back.

As I can be very indecisive I was very pleased to find out that they offered a 2 fer waffle plate which allowed me to actually try both of my choices!  They were both great.  My first time trying chicken and waffles..yum.  And then to satisfy my sweet tooth was the blueberry lemon waffle filled with a cheese mixture. My husband was very happy with his shrimp eggs benedict and especially liked their potatoes.  I was very happy with both my waffle choices and can't wait to come back when we return to the area.

To the woman who said she can make everything they make herself at home and they don't offer specialty drinks, I call you out! They make the best mochas! The barista takes real pieces of chocolate (your choice: dark, milk or white), puts it in a mixing cup, pours hot steamed milk over it, then uses a handheld blender to mix it all up and melt the chocolate, adding espresso and more steamed milk to make a perfectly balanced, absolutely decadent mocha. You're very cool if you're all set up to easily and routinely make that at home. They make really good frozen blended drinks, too. Oh, and one time my friend ordered a drink that was fresh whip cream in the cup with the espresso shot brewed right over it. I tried it and it was amazing!

We send it back and his next drink came out, and it came out with a faint hint of gin this time. What was he going to do? Send it back again? Good thing I went safe with wine. Secondly the waiter was very absent-minded. He was not attentive at all, and difficult to flag down. Hey, I get you're busy but pay attention to your patrons. The cauliflower bowl had such a virtually little cauliflower. What the heck? It's not like it's a meat. It's a freaking vegetable. Put some in the bowl! It was mostly rice with a few veggies. So I mentioned it was my honey's birthday and he said that they were going to get us a dessert. We waited and waited and waited and he claimed that there was back up in the kitchen and it was in line with a bunch of other orders. Judging from the dessert menu, I can't imagine what took so long. I told him we had a show to catch at eight and needless to say we left without the dessert. Still wondering what kind of dessert needed to be cooked that long or what was really going on.

I am vegetarian so burgers aren't always exciting because usually my only option is a black bean burger, which is just a patty made with black beans.  There is nothing wrong with a black bean burger, but there is now something called... THE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER.  WAY better than a black bean patty.  It has better texture and just tastes better and it is also vegetarian!  The ONLY downfall is that it literally is the most expensive burger on the menu.  I think it has to do with the fact that the 'Impossible burger' is not a recipe made by Hopdoddys.  Either way, I have literally eaten that burger 4 times (I live really close by and its walking distance) and I will eat it again.  Oh and I have also recommended it to all of my vegetarian friends because there is no other burger out there for vegetarians that tastes so close. \\n\\n\\nI also want to add that they have really good shakes and fries.

Say Hi to Yo(ur) Motha fo(r) Me\\" ...\\n\\nIt was worth it. \\n\\nThis is a big cheesy, bubbly pizza: no restrained whole-wheat thin-crust postage-stamp bullhockey for you. Decent crust; the cornmeal is a nice touch, gives it a little more body, a little more flava. Pizza crust is the only carbohydrate I willfully hate, but Santarpio's had a good chew (if being a tad thick and, I don't know, can pizza crust be ponderous? I think it was ponderous.) Toppings go underneath the cheese which prevents slippage: most thoughtful! The ingredients are high-quality. Sauce is a little thin, a little too sweet, but overall, very good with plenty of herbs. Pies are one-size-fits-all but definitely big and satisfying. For one person. Who might get one while watching Law & Order: SVU.\\n\\nI love having to walk into the kitchen to fetch takeout, and I especially love when I slip on the wet floor. It's a real cute party trick I have.\\n\\nReally good, traditional, straightforward pizza that my grandpappy would love."},{"name":"DJ's at The Garden","address":"222 Friend St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I dig it.   After hearing a bit of murmuring about DJ's at the Garden (it seemed people knew about it, but didn't know ABOUT it), we found ourselves in the dreaded North Station area yesterday afternoon, in desperate need of a beverage (we were about to embark on \\"High School Musical: The Ice Tour\\").  \\"What the heck\\" we thought, \\"it's owned by the same people as the Junction, and we know we love that place\\".  So we ventured into the spot where many other people (in far less clothing) had tried, and failed.  This is the old Hooters/Coyote Ugly, but you wouldn't know it once you were inside.  The place is done in a sort of minimalistic design, lots of shiny wood and dark metal (?).  The kind of place that's not uncomfortable when empty, but also wouldn't seem jam packed when busy.  Two thumbs up for decor/atmosphere.\\n\\nGiven it was 3 on a Sunday, the place was practically empty, with staff by far outweighing patrons.  Despite the fact they were probably making little to no money, the staff was all very friendly and prompt.  We had just come from a delectable brunch, so we were just looking for a drink, but the beer was clean and cold, and despite a minor hiccup in opening the frangelico bottle, my mom dug her spiked coffee.  \\n\\nAll in all, I'd be more than willing to give DJ's a second try next time I'm in the area.  A quick glance at the menu definitely enticed the taste buds, and DJ's managed to be comfortable without the whole meathead atmosphere that seems to dominate the other local sports bars.  My mom and I kept remarking how we'd like to come back and try lunch there soon, and I can guarantee that's something I've NEVER said at the Greatest Bar."},{"name":"Pho Van","address":"8557 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It was really good!

That was great!"},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"575 Broadway W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"What the heck is going on here?\\n\\nI had a 25 dollar gift card for Cactus Club, and I walked in with a bit of a patronizing attitude, not being a fan of chain restaurants, finding them useful only when in the suburbs and not knowing where to go. The BF and I had had a good veggie experience in the 'burbs while visiting family and were happy to have a mostly free supper.\\n\\nWhen the menu was placed in front of me I nearly spat out my water. The prices were, well, laughable. I have absolutely NO problem shelling out big bucks for great food, but it baffles me that anyone would spend 25 ++ on a pre-fab cookie cutter entree. \\n\\nThat said - the new menu, with some options by Rob Feenie, is nice and cohesive and his options look good. We started with the Tuna Tataki, served with a nice crunchy salad of daikon, avocado and mango and a lovely yuzu dressing. The sear on the tuna, however, was abysmal. I either want it completely raw or with nice cooked edges, and this was somewhere in between. Also, we noticed that while our plate had 5 pieces, the other tables around us who ordered got 7 slices. :(\\n\\nWe then moved on and shared the portobello mushroom fajitas. We have had these before and really liked them, but this time the veggies had not been blackened enough with cajun spice and were kind of soft and bland. Not yummy in a tortilla! The toppings were paltry - literally a tablespoon each of salsa, cheese and sour cream, and we ran out less than halfway through the meal. Iceberg lettuce was the only other topping. For 17 dollars of just veggies you would think that they could jazz it up a little, no?\\n\\nThe service, though friendly, was awful. We literally had to wait 15 minutes for drinks, and then when our fajitas arrived and we asked for hotsauce it didn't come....until we were finished our meal. We also waited a ridiculous amount of time to get some extra tortillas (which still arrived before the hot sauce did). \\n\\nAll in all, we left feeling a bit smug, surveying the packed restaurant and thinking \\"Good! Stay here! Leave the good restaurants for us! :)\\""},{"name":"Song La","address":"411 W 23rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Some of the best Asian food I've had in Austin.

Compared to the other (maybe better known) authentic Mexican fast food spots around town LTL (this location at least) is cleaner and nicer inside. It's built out more like an American style burrito place. But the food is as authentic as anywhere. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty broad, tacos, burritos, huaraches, quesadillas, and more. Of course, the tortas are the star attraction. They have a huge variety of fillings and combinations of fillings. \\n\\nOn my first visit I ordered a Torta Norteno (which was listed as \\"locas\\") It was as milanesa torta with two kinds of cheese. It was very good, but the primary flavor of the torta was richness. The milanesa and both cheeses were very rich tasting, but nothing provided the salty, meaty, tangy kick a sandwich needs to complement the bread. Fortunately, the salsa/condiments bar is very expansive and offered plenty of options to juice it up. The torta was big. I considered ordering a taco al pastor to go, but was too full after the torta. The bread was exactly right for a torta and toasted perfectly. \\n\\nOn succeeding visits, I've ordered a variety of tacos to try the various fillings. The tacos are not as good as the tortas. I found the yellow corn tortillas to be a little thick and dry. They had a deep masa flavor which I though overwhelmed the fillings. I personally prefer the smoother flavor of white corn tortillas. The fillings I've tried, pastor, asada, pollo, chorizo, and carnitas have all been good. The carnitas and pastor were the best.\\n\\nThe tacos are good, but not the best around. So, I'll probably stick to the tortas going forward, they're fantastic.\\n\\nThe service was always good. The default language here is Spanish, but they had no problem taking and fulfilling this gringo's orders.\\n\\nA couple small issues: The menu is written on a wall above and to the left of the register where you order. So, you can't actually see the menu from the register. The closest spot to the register where you could see the whole menu is probably 15 feet away. So, make sure you figure out what you want before you walk up to the register. Also, there are no labels on the salsa/condiments bar, so it's not entirely clear what everything is or how spicy."},{"name":"Matchstick Coffee Roasters","address":"639 E 15th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Best coffee so far I had in Vancouver.

We wanted to try some place none of us had been, and we finally decided upon Orinoco.  Most of us haven't had much in the way of Venezuelan food, but I figured I might as well gain a little cultural capital into this South American country.  I'm sure Hugo Chavez would be proud.\\n\\nThe restaurant is small, but not suffocating.  The walls have various pieces of art on the wall, and the colors within the restaurant were vibrant yet not overpowering.  Basically, it didn't look like someone had raided the local hardware store, stolen every available neon/bright color, and gone berserk with it all in order to make the place seem more Latino faux festive.  Save that shit for tourists.  A three-sided bar exists immediately to the left of the entrance and it seems like a great place to have a drink (if you can find a seat) while waiting for a table since Orinoco does NOT take reservations.  Fortunately, since we're all really, really, really good looking (think Blue Steel or Magnum) we did not have this problem.  Or we might have just perfectly timed our entrance.\\n\\nRegardless, we were seated immediately and our server was awesome.  I've noticed several reviews put the beat down on the personnel at this joint, but our guy was uber-helpful; he recommended various drinks and meals, he was quick and efficient when needed, yet more reserved with his presence when the four of us simply wanted to talk and enjoy our meal.  Honestly, service was top notch.  He was definitely a five star employee.  So from my experience, service on a Thursday night around seven is immaculate.\\n\\nWe started with the arepa pernil and the empanada verde.  The arepa was nothing to right home about.  If this is Venezuelan street food, I'll stick to delicious carnitas tacos from some Mexican taco truck.  The maize that made up the sandwich seemed hard and flavorless, while pork was dried up.  The empanada was a different story.  Very unexpectedly (I guess I should have read the menu a bit more closely . . . maybe I'm illiterate), it seemed more like a mixed green salad with the empanada cut up into four pieces arranged neatly around the greens.  However, the mixture of warm mushroom, cheese, and plantain dough was exquisite when matched with the salad, which had a light, fragrant dressing.  Everything complemented each other so well together.\\n\\nMy sister and I ordered the pabellon criollo, which consisted of shredded beef, white rice, black beans, and plantains.  It was one of the cheaper items on the menu, but that didn't make it any less delicious.  The beans and rice were good; you can't really fuck up black beans and rice.  If you do, and you're a cook at a restaurant that charges the prices Orinoco charges, your ass should be locked up for the culinary crime of sheer ineptitude.  The beef was a decent sized portion and reminded me of the barbacoa I've had at many Mexican joints.  My sister seemed to enjoy the meal as well.\\n\\nMy wife and her wife also seemed to like their meals.  My wife had a steak that was flavorful, but not out of this world, and it was very tiny for the price.  I can't quite remember the name of it.  My sister's wife had a salad with some seared yellow-fin tuna; I tried the tuna, and it tasted like seared tuna.  Both of them seemed to enjoy their meals, but   weren't raving about how they couldn't wait to have them again.\\n\\nBasically, if you're in the neighborhood, check it out if you want something different.  It won't make you want to book a trip to Venezuela immediately, but it might make you Google the country to learn a little bit more about its culture.  Does that sound like faint praise?"},{"name":"Preference Noodle House","address":"4854 Imperial Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4","text":"This place is like a diamond in the rough for noodle soup.

Their deep fried fish was crisp and the fried rice was smoky, a little greasy, but delicious. Their chicken nuggets were juicy but crunchy, with a better flavor than that of bubble world.

The grilled onions along with the masala on the side complimented the juicy chicken!\\n\\nSlightly loud atmosphere, dont need a reservation, pricey for a date for college students esp. if you're doing more than just dinner for the night."},{"name":"The Big Kahuna","address":"","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I had this place bookmarked for a while and finally found myself nearby and stopped in. \\n\\nI ordered the Beef Bulgogi and did not like it  at all.

As for Hopdoddy, the line was out the door and around the corner. When I got there, that line showed that it must be good.\\n\\nMy party was fortunate that the hostess came out to look for 3 to sit at the bar. We had only been waiting 10 minutes and was able to sit at the bar and bypass the super long line. One of my friends timed the people in front of us and they didn't get into the bar area for over an hour.

I did ask for no jalapenos, but it came with it, so I just picked it out myself. The burger was fantastic. The ingredients were so fresh and flavorful. I don't like tomatoes, which in the burger descriptions doesn't have tomatoes, but when I bit into it and found out there was a slice, I didn't care. The taste was so good that I ate it with the burger.

Amazing food, very fair prices, good portions, and short wait to get in despite the hustle and bustle of dinner rush.\\n\\nFirst thing that we noticed when we first entered the restaurant was the delectable smell of spices and sounds of laughter and lively conversation. The waiting room was nice and cozy with seating, and you are provided with an online tracking of your position and those before you, as well as their approximate wait times. Seating was extremely fast however, about 15 minutes even though we came in with several groups ahead of us, making the fact that Desta doesn't do reservations for small groups a non-issue.\\n\\nWe asked for the server recommendations and were told that the Tibs were their most renowned dishes. I ordered the Tibs with lamb, accompanied by rice cooked with the meat (an additional option for a very fair price of $0.75), along with the injera bread and miser stew. My girlfriend ordered the Tibs with lamb, injera, as well as potato stew. We also got the sambusa appetizer to start things off.\\n\\nThe sambusa was really similar to a spring roll, with a nice crispy outside and having a meat or vegetarian filling. The sambusa apps came with a dipping sauce as well, that was very beautifully seasoned and spiced. It had a nice spicy kick, and definitely took the sambusa to the next level.\\n\\nThe Tibs came provided with an additional basket of injera bread rolls. For those who, like me, had never eaten injera bread - I cannot more strongly endorse these delicious, soft, spongey pieces of dough. They have a sour flavor and have a soft spongey texture, that makes it perfect for scooping up the meat and vegetables of the Tibs dish with your hands. I found myself devouring these rolls of injera rapidly, and found that they were one of my most favorite types of flatbread in my recollection. The actual Tibs were amazing as well - the meat was perfectly seasoned and spiced, and were cooked perfectly - with great texture and juiciness. The accompanying vegetables and peppers were sauted and the rice had soaked up all the flavor from the meat and vegetables perfectly. \\n\\nI had never had Ethiopian food before, and was more than pleasantly surprised - I think that Desta's was probably the best meal I have had in a long time, and they really nailed the food experience. Furthermore, the prices were very fair and the portions were really good, even though I devoured my meal and the injera rolls rapidly.\\n\\nIf I ever am in Atlanta again, or I know of any friends heading in that direction, I will no doubt recommend Desta to any and all."},{"name":"Pier 6 Boston Waterfront","address":"1 8th St","city":"Charlestown","stars":"3.5","text":"Great lobster roll (got the cold one with mayo) and an IPA sitting with a great view of the water.

The only one that stood out as bad was the chawanmushi. It was badly prepared, totally over-salted and just was not good. Would definitely not recommend. The calamari were fried well, and I liked the thin slices of sliced peppers that gave it a nice kick. The dan dan noodles would have been really good, but it was so spicy that we weren't able to finish it. And I love spicy. Maybe it was just our batch that got over-spicy-ed. The tea smoked ribs were tender, but again salty. The nasi-goreng was quite nice. The pineapple chunks added a sweet juicy touch to the dish, and the egg over the rice was very nicely done.

The whole process from ordering to getting your food is pleasant. Great staff/management, clean restaurant, sustainable...just a simple, no-frills, beer and burger concept. None of those hipster-bullshit, rock and roll themed burgers with Cheetos and pork belly and kimchi and other garbage in it. So no complaints on that end. Simply put, Hopdoddy's makes a respectable burger. In-house made buns, fresh ingredients and locally sourced beef. It all sounds good on paper. The burgers, however are just decent. I don't know...I guess with the 3000+ reviews and all the hype, I expected more. Methinks Hopdoddy's just gets the hometown pass from the Austinites, the same kinda pass In-n-Out gets from the West Coasters. I wasn't wowed by the burgers. They were just okay.\\n\\nThe fresh baked bun was good. Light and airy. I like a little more chew on my bread products, but that's just me being picky. The beer selection was interesting. The truffle fries were pretty good too. No complaints here either.\\n\\nI ordered \\"the Classic Burger\\". I'm a purist when I comes to burgers. So for me, the perfect burger is 80/20 ground chuck with a loose/chunky-ish grind, salt & pepper and a proper sear. I'm not a fan of fancy meat blends, secret marinades etc. I think this is where Hopdoddy's let me down. The burger I got was juicy and cooked to a proper medium rare, but somehow, it seriously lacked the seared brown-ness. There was no color on the meat. It was just gray and kinda flavorless. The second thing, the burger seemed too dense. Like the meat was finely ground and worked, worked and overworked into a tight, perfectly shaped patty. The bite on the meat was so homogenous and boring. The texture just wasn't right for me.\\n\\nSo long story short, Hopdoddy's makes a decent burger but too much hype surrounding it.

Please note two things: firstly, I don't eat seafood so my options were severely limited. Secondly, I can't eat gluten, so my choices were even further restricted. These two points definately influence my opinion.\\n\\nOn with the review!\\n\\nI nipped into Coast today for lunch, knowing my choices were going to be limited (location was not my choice). We had reservations so seating was no issue. Our server was nice - but the initial drink order - water \\"still, sparkling or spring?\\" I lived in Europe, I'm used to \\"still or sparkling.\\" But I'm not in Europe, I'm in Vancouver (very very different). It seems like an establishment trying too hard. Just a personal annoyance.\\n\\nMy lunch choice was the Organic Green Salad. It was the only thing I knew I wouldn't have to hassle the server for confirm was GF (gluten free). So at least I had a clear option. The menu did say there was sa vegetarian menu, but I hate going to a restaurant and having to be Miss High Maintenance and asking for the \\"special menu.\\" Why not just put it on the same menu so it's not just a \\"you're different\\" kinda thing?\\n\\nOur food was served up quickly, lunch hour and all which was cool. My salad was total meh. I mean, I've had salads that made me wish I could eat salad for every meal. This one had uneven dressing, too much arugula (like half arugula) and like three candied pecans which to me was the exciting part of the salad. It was topped with a lone raspberry. It had raspberry vingarette, so I get the theme, but really, one? And my three sad little pecans which just got lost in the arugula. For the price ($8) it was a decent size which I guess is a pro, but again, all arugula. In fairness, I was in a seafood restuarant, not a salad restuarant.\\n\\nI'm not much of an arugula fan.\\n\\nI will say the all staff I encountered was attentive and service was good, but at least to me it had the \\"I'm trying to hard\\" impression.  \\n\\nThe bar area is really cool - the seafood just lieing around is visually cool. But sitting near the bar I could smell it (sensitive to smell). \\n\\nI would go back, because the place was cool looking and again, contrived or not, service was good.

Then when we asked for checks he asked who was going to be paying for a taco that NO ONE ordered.

The fried spring rolls were nothing special if you are from an asian family or have eating a half decent chinese restaurant. Anyone can make these themselves at home. Nothing to rave about. \\n\\nFried chicken and waffles were so-so. They were nicely seasoned and very moise for chicken. The waffles were decent as well.

I decided to spoil myself and get two oysters. These things were quite small and incredibly expensive. Hey, they tasted good, especially with the lovely brine Sea Level uses, but to me, they're not worth 2.75 (market price) each. Maybe if they were a little larger... but putting this teeny tiny thing in my mouth, and realizing I just ate about $3 (with taxes and tips) really makes me think about the value I'm getting.\\n\\nBack to the lobster roll!\\n\\nWell, this one was just very good! It wasn't excellent, but still highly enjoyable. You see, based on past experiences, a lobster roll was ground up lobster meat with mayonnaise in bread. While there are a couple small points that could be improved, overall, the meal was pleasant. \\n\\nI liked that the lobster wasn't ground as finely as burger meat, instead, it was rather chunky. The advantage here is some of the texture of lobster was preserved, and it was evident that it came from a real lobster, instead of some imitation. However, I found that the chunks were inconsistent. Some were quite small, and others were almost bite size by themselves! \\n\\nThe fact that butter was used instead of mayonnaise was awesome. While I liked that they did not marinate the lobster in butter and that the flavor was not overpowering, I think just a touch more would be beneficial. All that needs to be done is to up the subtle hint of a regular hint. \\n\\nThe leaf of lettuce, I assume was placed there as a divider between the lobster and the bread. If I'm right, then it was fine, however, if it is meant to add some flavor, then having a tiny bit more crunch would be nice.\\n\\nFor crunch, they have homemade potato chips that come with the roll. I really liked these, both in terms of thickness, and the amount of crunch. I also give them massive points for not overdoing it on the salt. \\n\\nThe bread was of surprisingly high quality! It was soft, not cottony, and lightly buttery in flavor. Here, the amount of butter flavor was perfect. Felt fresh, and not like mass produced hot dog rolls. \\n\\nCole Slaw was absolutely on point. I don't remember specifics, only that I loved the consistency, the flavor (from added herbs and spices), and the fact that it was not drenched in some class of sauce. \\n\\nI was going to give this place only 3 stars, but, once I looked at the market price for lobster meat, I decided not to penalize them. I thought a $25 lobster roll is an outrageously high price... it still is, only lobster meat goes for $50/lb, so I can't be as hard on them. \\n\\nStill, having done some haphazard research, I find prices are still a little steep (even considering profit margin). This, and the lobster roll not being perfect is what cost Sea Level the coveted fifth star. \\n\\nFinally, just a little extra info: location is clean, with a great view of Derby Wharf. Service is polite and fairly prompt. Dessert menu is stamped on the paper tablecloth (changed every time) is a nice touch; However, they were running low on ink, and it was hard to see. Maybe have backup ink pads or printed dessert menus... just a thought"},{"name":"Boston Market","address":"1010 Morrissey Boulevard","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"The drive thru has been closed for months, the food quality is not as good as it was two years ago, and the place is ditty.

There was something miraculous about the French omelette BLT I had here yesterday. Never before have I eaten a sandwich as delicious and/or flavorful.\\n\\nNever before have I eaten a sandwich as quickly while still savoring every bite. Think about that scene in Ratatouille where the critic is eating that ratatouille, and his whole life is flashing before his eyes. He pictures childhood, his mom cooking him his favorite meal, he savors every bite. That was me and that sandwich.\\n\\nThe platform for this sandwich was Texas toast; how could it not be delicious? I paid $1.00 extra for duck egg, simply out of curiosity. This sandwich must have had at least three eggs. Also piled into this giant, divine creation: pesto (I think), sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, arugula and Havarti (I think). It was comically massive, but if I could have, I would have forced myself to eat another one in rapid succession. It was tangy, it was sweet, it was creamy, it was cheesy, it was savory. My mouth felt like it was in that Willy Wonka tunnel, only with delicious things and not gross things.\\n\\nI got out of there at $11.00 after the egg up-charge and I bought a baklava and a soda. A bit steep for a food cart, but the same sandwich at a restaurant would probably be $11.00 by itself, if not more. I would go back there right now. In fact, I wanted to go there last night for dinner and try the yak burger, but my boyfriend wanted to have a drink with his meal so he ixnayed the idea.\\n\\nYou can tell that this lady knows how to use great ingredients in innovative and delicious ways. I would love to see what she could do in a brick and mortar, but I'm so grateful to have her as close as a 5 minute walk (seriously! so great!) with easy accessibility and affordable food for the time being.

Then we had the seafood grill (tandoor) and lamb korma. The lamb was bland and the korma sauce (although we ordered it hot) tasted like coconut milk with a splash of spices and it, not in the least bit spicy or aromatic. As for the seafood grill, outside the grilled taste from the tandoor, the spice was also pretty limited. This resulted in good salmon and prawns, but underwhelming Mahi.

After reading all the reviews I was really excited to try this place. I finally had the opportunity this weekend and I was.....disappointed. I dont care about the ambiance or service or any of that. It is a hole in the wall pizza joint in Eastie. How nice can it be? I find the best food can often be found in a unassuming places. I found this pizza to be average. Not bad, certainly good but not, dude I am gonna stand on the side of the road for hours for this pizza good. Don't get me wrong. It is better than your average house of grease and certainly blows those nasty chain places out of the water but after the reviews on here I was expecting a pizza orgasm. Check it out if you are in the neighborhood but there is pizza just as good in the Northend as well."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Over all an OK lunch spot.

We had bought sandwiches to take to the movie with us. However when we arrived the theater was closed (due to a \\"bathroom issue\\"). So we thought ourselves where is a cool local place that will let us eat our sandwiches and let us have a beer and wallow in sorrow. We went to the Burnside brewery and were told by the manager that it was their \\"policy\\"  that they would not allow us to eat out food there. She was really very rude. So we went out and ate our sandwiches in our car (in the parking lot). Afterwards we went to the 15th Ave hophouse. They offered to let us eat our sandwiches in there (however we had already eaten them in our car). They also gave us a free beer each because they felt so bad for us. While I know this doesn't necessarily reflect on the quality of their food or beer, I do feel that the Burnside brewery could use a lesson in taking care of their customers.

But I do want to give props to my favorite sports place, and the place I go for what I like to call College Football Saturday; first allow me to get nostalgic for a different location--a B-Dubs that has long passed into history. \\n\\nThe north campus Buffalo Wild Wings circa 1990s was an oasis for the young, new-in-town, student I was. I loved that place; it was much like B-Dubs today but stuck in a hole-in-the-wall space. I remember countless hours soaking down suds and sucking off tongue-burning hot chicken while engaging in a trivia matches. Although it served a different clientele than the meat-markets south, the North Campus BWW was a great place to meet girls, and friends.  It is gone today; it fell in favor of the cathedral on Lane and High--squeaky clean as it is it will never match the authenticity of the original that it doesn't have the character to match. \\n\\nSo I will review my second favorite BWW--Bethel Road.  What make Bethel great is the servers; they are knowledgeable, timely, and courteous. Some of the bar tenders have worked there forever, and do a wonderful job. They always have a good selection of beer on tap: domestic, Guinness, ale, and other--as well as a large selection of bottled. \\n\\nThe food is good. I am not going to lie and say they are top notch, but I am not going to act like they are horrible either. They are a chain. They are in-between--it is not \\"die to have\\", but they can make a good meal. I do really love their pulled-pork. In any sauce I pick it is always rich and delicious. \\n\\nIt has a lot of space. The family section is as big as I have ever seen in a BWW. Screens hang on all walls for TVs, smaller viewers are fixed on every table. There is not a seat in the house out of view of one. The staff is always helpful to turn the channel.  There is also a patio for smokers, half of which is covered in the winter months. \\n\\nCons. As a corporate shop the quality and quantity of the food is dependent on the commodity markets. When food prices are high, the amount of meet on the wings is low. That suck IMHO. They also will skim off on the amount of fries you get with sandwiches, so much so I end up ordering an extra. They do this so they don't have to raise prices. I'd rather just pay more. \\n\\nWhat makes B-dubs good is the TVs. For my favorite teams--especially the Ohio State University Buckeyes--I generally like a smaller, more intimate setting (a smaller bar with passionate regulars and a easy going bartender.) so BWW is not the place. But for just enjoying several games of a sport you like the B-Dubs on Bethel is THE PLACE. I have a routine I do every autumn Saturday I can;  I come here to stay all day soaking in beer, wings, fries, pork and football--heaven. Of course, you can do that with sport of your choice. NCAA basketball tourney, baseball, NFL. \\n\\nI give it 3-stars; which is pretty good for a corp."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

Make sure they bring it you on a true brioche bun because they tried to get over and bring my burger on a regular bun you serve at a bbq. My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich that came on a pretzel bun. I think they make their pretzel buns from scratch bc it was almost like eating a bun made my Aunty Anne's.

Alexandra's review is spot on, but I thought I'd add a few breakfast touches.   First of all, this place is very friendly ,  very homey and very cheap for breakfast.  I had a nice plate of chorizo con huevos for $4.25.  It comes with very good beans and potatos and tortillas and great table salsa.     I prefer corn tortillas, which were decent, but my dh got flour and they looked homemade!   The fella got pork chop and eggs which looked good.  He's had the ribeye with eggs before, which was yummy -- only $9.99.  The breakfast tacos are ridiculously cheap.   They also have machaca and eggs, although I didn't try it. \\n\\n I really don't mean to dis Tex-mex, but I really prefer more traditional Mexican fare and I can get it here, albeit they do have migas and flour tortillas, yada yada, for the Tex Mex lovers.\\n\\nOn other weekend mornings, there have been mariachis,  or, at least, a guy in a guayabera with a guitar with a very nice voice singing traditional Mexican songs and taking requests.\\n\\nSometimes, in the mornings, this place is PACKED.  I have no idea why we didn't have to wait this morning, but I was happy.  And now I'm very full.\\n\\nWaitresses are very nice here.  The bakery is a huge plus -- it smells devine, has beautiful pan dulce  and you can also buy traditional Mexican sweets at the counter like milk candy and candied sweet potato, etc.  I love that stuff, crave it, (and hide it in my desk.)"},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"I went here for the first time last night.

I dunno, the duck entrees at Mirabelle or Dinh Ho have been a more enjoyable meal. \\nOn the positive note, the ribeye, chicken, and tuna were all well done with very complimentary sauces, rubs, vegetables.  The waiter was attentive and prompt.  The garlic bread and focaccia were very good as well.

We ordered the carrots, which were very good and a nice start to our culinary adventure.  We then had the rabbit, which came in the shape of mini-sausages, which were tasty, juicy and very flavorful.  We ended with the pig, which was delicious.  They serve it in 3 forms and, albeit not  a fan of fried food, the fried version was heaven in my mouth, but all forms were succulent.

We ordered Crispy Fried Artichokes and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms as appetizers. The artichokes were awful and tasted like the vinegar brine that low-end canned artichokes come in. We couldn't eat them. The mushrooms were thoroughly bland and had no flavor at all. I had ice tea and my wife ordered a marguerita. She said her drink tasted like it had been made with ice in a blender rather than in a frozen marguerita machine. She said it barely had any taste other than ice. \\n\\nI had the Tuscan Chicken Limone. I chose a minestrone soup. The soup looked and tasted exactly like Progresso's canned minestrone. The entree tasted like it had just been warmed up in the microwave. The pasta did not appear to be fresh. The artichokes in it tasted just like the ones in the appetizer, a heavy brine taste. I couldn't eat them either. It was supposed to come with fresh steamed baby spinach. There were only 3 leaves of it on my plate. \\n\\nMy wife had the Brewhouse Blond Shrimp. She had the broccoli-cheddar soup with it.  It also looked and tasted like fresh out of the can. The description of her entree suggested a lightly battered, tempura-like crust, very lightly fried entree. What came on her plate was very dark, deep fried, corn meal encrusted, barely edible shrimp. My wife ate two of them. I tasted one and didn't want another bite. The cole slaw was inedible; however the thin crispy fries were very tasty. \\n\\nThe service was adequate, but not exceptional. To her credit, our waitress took the artichoke appetizer off our ticket when we told her how bad they were. We are not restaurant snobs. We have favorite places, both chain and local. We like to occasionally try new places. We always hope for the best, but BJ's Brewery came closer to the worst. I would have considered the prices reasonable if the food had been tasty.

Here is what I have tried:\\n\\nGarlic Bread - made on a sub roll, great for dipping in their pasta sauces\\n\\nLobster Mac 'n' Cheese (Alfredo style) - Please ask for it with alfredo sauce, it is way better than their standard cheese sauce. The girl at the counter actually gave me the recommendation. The portion is big enough for 2 to share and there was generous amounts of lobster.\\n\\nChicken Teriyaki sub (with cheese) - I get mine with cheese and a little bit of mayo.

The double cooked potatoes were a beautiful golden color. \\n\\nSo, here is the rub, all of the components were great, but the plate was off.  Since there was so much smoked salmon, which is dry, salty and naturally oily - it needed something to lift it and lighten it. The sauce would have been a perfect foil, only there was so little of it I could only taste it if I scraped off a little in my knife.  \\n\\nThe shortage of sauce wouldn't have been so obvious, except one of the two eggs was over cooked - no runny yolk to ooze out to bring the flavors together.

The problem - no seasoning - zero.  If they would have just salted the water when they boiled them, it would have made all of the difference. \\n\\nDo the bottom line is that this was close to an awesome and flavorsome meal - but the opportunity was missed by being assembled without thinking about the final plate.

I was somewhat reticent given all the reviews I'd read about \\"French\\" service (which apparently means contemptuous, although I've never experienced this Gallic hallmark when I've been in Paris), but I feared worse - someone's inaccurate idea of stereotypical French snobbery.\\n\\nWell, the fear was unfounded. Our server was very friendly & informative. At the end of our evening (we closed the place) several staff inquired as to whether we enjoyed our meal. I was given a complimentary glass of fruit wine to pair with my creme br√ªl√©e & warmly wished a happy birthday by our waiter. Service was excellent.\\n\\nFood was lovely. The pate was perfect - nice & moist & flavourful, & served in a medium-sized ramekin so definitely best to share. Someone had an arugula salad which looked nice, & the marinated olives were delicious. I would've liked to try the escargot but steered clear this time due to the Yelp reviews. Next time.\\n\\nMy tenderloin dish was perfect. I asked for it cooked blue & they listened. The vegetables were al dente & the gratin potatoes were lovely. I'm looking forward to going back so I can have the exact same thing again.\\n\\nI ordered the creme br√ªl√©e for dessert because everyone, including our server, seemed to love it. It was indeed delicious: very smooth, not overpoweringly sweet, & an excellent way to close out the meal. It reminded me a lot of a Portuguese custard tart in terms of its flavour & consistency, which is fine with me!\\n\\nNot sure of the damage as my friends paid the bill. Not cheap, of course, but based on the menu prices it's not exorbitant, either. I'll definitely be back!\\n\\nMy suggestion: try to go with more than two people so you're not stuck sitting at the middle row of two-tops between the wall seating and the bar - or try for a seat at the bar if there are just two of you.

Unfortunately, Myers & Chang did not meet my expectations and I had a really disappointing meal. I don't mean to be a black sheep here on Yelp, but the food and service were lacking...\\n\\nSo upon arrival, the place was PACKED! It smelled delicious, had a cool Asian vibe, and looked casual/upscale at the same time. Also, Porter Robinson was playing the background -- major bonus points :P However, walking in, the hostess wasn't exactly the friendliest and told us the wait would take an hour, which we were okay with. I was surprised she didn't ask for a phone number when we said we were going to walk around outside in the time being. I ended up actually getting seated 15 minutes later when I booked a reservation on OpenTable. So strange.\\n\\nI would say Myers & Chang is like a resume. Everything looked great on the paper menu, but in reality, the food didn't taste good at all. We were also disappointed the restaurant wasn't accommodating in some of the items in our meals, such as mix and matching dumplings, or adding meat to some noodle dishes. I find it odd because I'm pretty sure most places premake the dumplings and then fry upon order...\\n\\nAnyway, here's the breakdown of what we ordered:\\n- Pork dumplings: oily, oily, OILY!! The meat tasted pretty fatty and lacking flavor.\\n- Wasabi dumplings:  Nice twist to vegetable dumplings. I would love this if it weren't so oily!\\n- Thai chicken: Reminds me of chicken noodle soup. This dish was delicious; probably my favorite. The meat was so tender and fell off the bone! Yummo.\\n- Scallion pancakes: Okay, scallion pancakes are my weakness. I grew up eating this, so it has a special place in my heart. I was curious to see how their remade scallion pancakes would end up.... It reminded me of a savory version of funnel cake :( The bf and I didn't even finish this and had our server take it away. If you know me, I practically NEVER waste food because I love food so much. No scallions whatsoever. Just salty.\\n- Stuffed trout: Not bad.... The coconut rice inside is pretty good. Not too memorable, though. \\n\\nI honestly don't see what's the hype about this place... Maybe I'm more a traditional Chinese food type of gal. Regardless, I would not come back. This place is overpriced for what it's worth. I'd rather go to Chinatown for dumplings.

We both ordered the meat lover dinner special and was looking forward to enjoying the butter chicken that came with our meal. I found the butter chicken to be very salty but adjusted the intense salt level with some yogurt. The paneer pakora that came with the meal was also salty and quite dry.\\n \\nHalf-way through our meal the hostess rudely approached us and asked if we wanted the bill. We were right in the middle of eating our dinner and nowhere even close to having dessert so I told her that we were still eating our meal and would ask for the bill later. She rolled her eyes and left. We saw her pacing back and forth and looked bored. A few minutes later while still eating our meal that same hostess returned to our table and dropped off a small box. She then walked away without saying a word. My friend opened up the box and inside it contained our bill. We found this to be quite odd as we were still eating and did not ask for the bill yet. In fact, just a few minutes ago I just told that same hostess that we were not ready for the bill yet. We looked around and the restaurant was not even busy with quite a few booths vacant. There were also no customers at the front waiting to be seated. We continued our meal when that same hostess returned again and abruptly asked us if we were paying by credit card. At that point we felt rushed to conclude our meal and got the vibe from the hostess that she just wanted us to get the heck out. She returned a few moments later with the credit card machine and prompted us to enter our credit cards and settle our bill. It was only 8:30pm on a Friday night and we were wanting to enjoy our meal and perhaps order some more food but because of this super rude hostess we were forced out of there. Not wanting to be rude my friend said \\"thank you\\" on the way out and this hostess just looked at him and rolled her eyes. \\n \\nTo top off the rude service we received at Ginger Indian Cuisine we were also overcharged for our meals! The dinner special we ordered should have only been $16 but we were charged $21.04 each. It wasn't until later when we were discussing what happened that my friend and I realized that we were overcharged for our meals.\\n \\nWe've certainly had way better tasting Indian meals elsewhere and the rude service we received from that hostess at Ginger Indian Cuisine is appalling. Ginger Indian Cuisine should look into giving this hostess better customer service training as they will likely lose business from hostess' like her. There was no reason for that hostess to have us settle our bill and abruptly send us on our way so early on in the meal.
