A wide selection of veggies and a fair selection of meats (chicken, pork, beef, fish, sausages).  You also get huge array of sauces so you can follow their template or get creative and make your own.  Compared to other Mongolian restaurants like this one, the shape and size of the bowls allow you to pack in more food, so definitely big big plus.\\n\\nOne turnoff for me was that the meats were frozen solid in the trays.  Maybe it's better for preservation, but definitely not for my appetite.  I've been to other places where the meats aren't frozen.  My optimistic side says that its more weight to push down to the bottom of the bowl though.  While watching the cooks do their thing was pretty fun, the taste at the end is at best fair.\\n\\nInstead of noodles I asked for white rice on the side, and the quantity of rice you get is pitiful.  Not sure if extra rice would cost extra, but I would definitely do with twice or three times as much easily.  Their sesame bread is pretty good though.\\n\\nOverall, it's an okay place if Mongolian Grille is in the area.  But I wouldn't go out of my way.

Usually we simply ask for more, but in this case, the server did not return to the table for quite a while.  Dinner served - all excellent as usual.  However, when we wanted to look at ordering a desert etc. The server was no where to be found.

In terms of the other meat, I'd pass on the sausage in the future (it had a good flavor, but it was very fatty/greasy and felt sort of loosely packed/didn't have that satisfying \\"snap\\"), and I'm not into ribs, so I can't help you there.

Smokehouse does some things really well, and other stuff could use some work.  We had Smokehouse on a Sunday night.  To share, my family ordered:  brisket, ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, beans, mac n cheese, and the molasses corn bread.  We had to get it to go, so I can't comment on the dining in experience.\\n\\nThe brisket looked burnt, but it was surprisingly tender.  I think maybe they finish it on a grill or douse it in sauce that gives it a darker appearance than typical, because it looked much darker than typical.  Either way, it was good, and had a nice bark to it.  Plus, they left some of the fat on the meat, which I prefer.\\n\\nThe ribs were a Jekyll and Hyde situation.  The ribs which were cooked really well were very tender, had a nice pull from the bone, weren't burned, yet had a slight crunch to them from the liberal application of the dry rub.  However, not every rib we received was like this.  We had some, at least a third of our order, which were much drier, or nearly burnt on the outside.  Additionally, the rub didn't appear to be applied evenly, which meant some spots were too salty and others didn't have enough flavor.  But, when the ribs were a hit, they were certainly a hit.\\n\\nI had a couple of bites of the pulled pork sandwich and really liked it.  The brioche bun had a slight sweetness to it and stood up well to the sandwich.  The pork was juicy and had a slight smokiness to them.  I liked the pickled onions and could have used more on the sandwich.  They also provided a crunch in an otherwise soft sandwich.  \\n\\nThe beans were a miss, and I think a case of adding too many ingredients to one dish.  The beans also include:  brown sugar (fine), molasses (great), meat \\"bits\\" (very commonly used), and cornbread crumbs (why?).  I think the cornbread was supposed to provide a crispy topping, like you see on a good mac n cheese.  But, it ended up sinking into the beans, making a mushy mess that wasn't discernible as a side dish of beans.  There was way too many non-bean items in the side dish of beans.\\n\\nThe mac n cheese, on the other hand, was very good.  It had the crunchy, cheesy top that you (or, at least I) want in a mac n cheese.  It was very cheesy but also seasoned well.  The macaroni had a bite to it, and it wasn't a clumpy mess.  Absolutely would order this dish again.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the bacon molasses cornbread.  This was basically a dessert with a couple of large chunks of bacon in it.  I'm not saying I didn't like it, it had a great molasses flavor and bacon with anything sweet is usually good.  But, it was too sweet.  It was certainly unique, I'll give Smokehouse that.\\n\\nI would give Smokehouse another shot, but there are certainly some items I wouldn't care to order again."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"1st time visiting Atlanta with my daughter.

There was nothing wrong with either experience, and there were even some pleasant surprises.  It's just that I don't understand the  massive appeal this food seems to have for so many people.\\n\\nLet's talk about chicken really quickly.  Most home cooks and fast food restaurants overcook the crap out of their chicken.  The current USDA minimum internal temp for chicken is 165.  The issue is that this allows for a very small margin of error.  If one's thermometer is off by a few degrees, or if the cooking conditions are such that temps will continue to rise slightly after being removed from the heat source, temps can quickly and easily rise above 170, bringing on an exponential deterioration in quality.  Salt/marinade/brine is another factor, as it allows poultry to retain more moisture while cooking by dissolving some of the protein that houses muscle fibers, preventing it from contracting as much as it would in an unbrined/unsalted bird.  Simply by brining/salting and paying relentless attention to internal temperature, the home cook can become a chicken grilling all-star.  \\n\\nI'm not intimately acquainted with Chick Fil A's methodology, but they're clearly paying great attention to one or both of these poultry commandments.  It's definitely better chicken than you get at other fast food restaurants.  The service has been excellent both times.  We were impressed with how well they managed the initial rush.  Food quality and consistency were non-issues.\\n\\nSo what's the issue?  Why 3 stars?\\n\\nIf you've cracked the code to making good chicken at home, this is just a convenient way to get good chicken on the road.  If you've gone beyond cracking the code of good chicken at home, this isn't quite as good.  I would need to try it once or twice more to say definitively, but my hunch is that Chick Fil A is wet-brined, and I feel that a dry brine produces a slightly better result (though either is better than no brine).\\n\\nIf you don't make good chicken at home, the price might seem reasonable.  If you do make good chicken at home, this will seem really expensive.\\n\\nOn a final note, I was somewhat disappointed by the southern-ness of some of the flavors.  My wife is from the south, so I'm familiar with the general differences in the Southern vs Northwestern palate.  Yes, this is an overgeneralization that will not apply to everyone, but in general, folks in the south like things a bit sweeter than folks in the northwest.  The lemonade was over the top in this regard.  Some of the sauces just didn't make culinary sense to me.  Several of them are just a bit too sweet, and some of them are sweet in a weird way, without being sufficiently offset by complex, bold spiciness.  Bottom line, I was very aware that the flavors were \\"not from around here.\\"  Some people will like that--especially if they used to live by a Chick Fil A or just like sweet sauces.  \\n\\nIf it was 15-20% cheaper and I brought my own sauce with me, I'd probably eat here quite a bit."},{"name":"TenOak","address":"409 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"OK!

We found it on a Yelp list of great restaurants in Vancouver and made reservations. Though I guess they take walk-ins when they have space, it seems more like a reservation-only type of place. It filled up very quickly while we were there, so make reservations if you want to go!\\n\\nOur server greeted us kindly as we came in, took our coats, and promptly seated us. The building is an old house, so we were seated in the \\"living room\\". It's very cozy, and they lit the fireplace up so it was very fun! Unfortunately, the building doesn't absorb noise very well and it got rather loud before long. The menu was impressive- lots of items that were unique and creative! I ended up choosing the Sablefish special for the night, since I'd never had sablefish and it came with a orange-soy sauce. This dish was the most impressive thing about the night. The fish was cooked to perfection and the sauce made it absolutely melt in my mouth! It was fabulous! The vegetables that came with it were mediocre, they didn't have much flavor and were a little chewy. My friend ordered the gnocchi which was also delicious! As a drink, I ordered an Aperol Spritz- nothing special, and she ordered the house white wine which was also nothing special.\\n\\nThe first disappointment for me was the bar. I originally asked for a Moscow Mule. It's a common drink and their Yelp page said they had a full bar. Our server said they couldn't do a Mule because they had no ginger ale! What kind of place claiming to have a \\"full bar\\" doesn't have ginger ale? It seems like a staple bar item, in my opinion. Honestly, a restaurant of this level should be as attentive to their bar as to their kitchen. Very sad.\\n\\nI normally don't order dessert, but we decided to splurge and make the most of the night. My decision was mostly based on the fact that they had cr√®me br√ªl√©e! This was their chance to recover from the bar disappointment. Sadly, this dessert ended up being the second disappointment of the night. They brought it out having already torched the top of it. It wasn't on fire! That's nearly all the fun of ordering a cr√®me br√ªl√©e at a restaurant, especially a fancy one! I almost cried. It seemed a cheap, lazy move on their part. My friend ordered tiramisu, which was average.\\n\\nThe final, and most painful, disappointment was the price at the end of the night. The special I had ordered ended up being a few dollars more than I was sure the server had told us. Three dollars isn't a lot to most people, but I live on a very tight budget and it was already an expensive dinner without the 3 extra surprise dollars. There's a chance I misheard her, but it was disappointing nonetheless. \\n\\nFor what I paid, I expected the dining experience to be much better than it was. Our server was excellent, the bathrooms were clean, and the food was decent. If I'm ever in Vancouver again, I doubt I'll return to Lupo. There are so many other unique restaurants that are worth trying in downtown Vancouver, and I can bet most of them are cheaper AND have ginger ale! It was a nice night, but I left with more regret and disappointment than a girls night out should have."},{"name":"Mudflats Bar and Grill","address":"31 Columbus St","city":"Galena","stars":"4","text":"I love Mudflats!

For a couple minutes, we just stood in the middle of the restaurant nervously, as the kind staff tried to come up with helpful ideas. \\n\\nThen owner came back from a delivery and asked about the situation. He insisted on driving us back to campus, and helped up carry all the food to the conference room, for no charge. In the car, he talked to us about Cambridge and the decades he's lived here, the restaurants that his father founded and that he now owns (including Punjabi Dhaba, another awesome restaurant), and his family. It was apparent that he really loved the city and his businesses, and that he really cared about making a quality establishment that was affordable to the people in the area, many of whom are students.\\n\\nIt definitely shows. IP is really clean and spacious, the servers are always prompt and friendly, and the food is consistently good. They are always on time or early with delivery and pick-up. The lunch buffet is also one of the least expensive in town, and what they serve there is the same quality as the ordered meals.\\n\\nIn general, their curries are flavorful, thick and creamy without feeling too heavy.

My favorite dishes here include malai kofta, chicken tikka masala, kheer, gulab jamun, and samosas.

The rib eye came with a set of 3 different salts to sprinkle on the meat, and I wish that they would have told us exactly what they were, but it was sort of fun to play \\"what does that salt taste like\\". \\n\\nI also wish that they would have had a better selection of meats....I was a bit surprised that the menu didn't have a very extensive list of meat compared to other steak places that I've been."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Probably the best pizza I've ever had!

The bad: The service is erratic, a few staff will be cool, most will be ambivalent or annoyed. Not in the fun way, but the \\"it's your fault I exist in this terrible job\\" way. Maybe the job really is that bad? The bar area has potential, but the bar staff rarely seem to care. This is tolerable when it's slow (because the food is so dang good) but if the area is even half full, it gets downright weird. \\n\\nLast night we sat down at the bar, 4 open bar chairs on each side of us, it took 7 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and during that time groups walked up, waited, and were served on each side of us. It was one of those moments where you wonder if you've been singled out for some reason. And the unreliable service continued to the food where we waited 30 minutes for a salad before going to the food counter to see if the buzzer was working. It turned out yes, it was, and our salad had been sitting there for awhile but no one knew what ticket it belonged to. Over dinner, we wondered how long it would have taken if we didn't go ask. \\n\\nYou get the feeling that FOH is disorganized and uninterested at a deeper level. We decided not to bother bringing anything up to a manager on duty. Didn't seem like they would care.

This was far and away my favorite restaurant in Boulder. Perfect portioning, evidence of respect for the food, over-the-moon amazing service. Yep, this place had everything going for it.\\n\\nBut something has happened. I don't know what, but somehow the place has gone astray.\\n\\nMy husband and I have been here about 5 times over the past 2 years and it always blew me away, as detailed above. Until this week. I came here Monday night with my husband and a close friend who was in town from Michigan for the week. My main motivation was their Boulder First Bite menu that they feature every Monday: Three courses (antipasti, primi, secondi) for $26. I was thrown off by the fact several of the offerings had changed and every single secondi item except for the one vegetable-only dish came with a $2 upcharge. To me this is tacky. If you are going to upcharge, do away with the notion of a prix fixe menu.\\n\\nOur waitress seemed like a typical college student who doesn't give a crap about tips. Her level of \\"real\\" service, which you'd expect from this place, was negligible at best. Normally I find their menu helpful for friends with allergies, because they label what is gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, etc. However my husband can have meat and sheep/goat cheese, but not any cow-based diary products (butter, cream, parm, etc). He asked our server and she just snipped \\"The vegan dishes are labeled on the menu.\\" When he again emphasized he isn't vegan and just wanted to know which dishes could be made without cow diary she just stood there and said \\"Um, I don't know really\\" and made NO move to ask the kitchen, be helpful, or generally, you know, do her job. She then asked if we wanted drinks and I said I'd look at the wine list after deciding on courses, and again she snipped, this time a quick \\"The wine list is on the table\\" and immediately flounced away. When the bread came, my husband asked about the ingredients, and a list of beers on tap. She came back with \\"The chef who made the bread is already gone so we don't know\\" and he had to remind her about checking on the beer. The bread thing caught up with me later when I saw another table being served other types of bread. Is there a possibility she could have found out those ingredients? Maybe. That kind of stuff really digs at me at places that I generally expect to go the extra mile for service (and before you judge, I want to throw out there that I tend to tip 20-25% in those cases whether it's on a $15 check or a $70 check).\\n\\nAnyway.\\n\\nThe food. Something has also gone amiss with the food. Everything was okay, but VERY rich which is unusual there. I am used to less of a heavy hand with the dishes. The chunks of cheese in my sauteed mushrooms and gnocchi were huge. The gnocchi was unusually fluffy; still good, but not as dense as usual. The portions were TINY, but served in 13\\" plates. This is just not a good idea in general unless you expect people to expect next to nothing which really wasn't the case. My main course, sea bass with polenta, was about 3oz of fish, cooked well but not that flavorful, and covered with some kind of chopped vegetable ragout that really overpowered the fish flavor. The polenta was about 3\\" square and 1\\" thick. Not nearly enough after two even smaller courses preceding. My friend got vegetable risotto and it was not risotto in any interpretation. The rice was longer grain, not starchy, not creamy, and felt undercooked on my tongue. It tasted good but the dish itself should have been named something else, or executed differently. If you make risotto different, ok, that's your thing, but warn people about that. If I had ordered the dish and expected beautiful creamy, pearly risotto made of abrorio rice, I would have sent this back.\\n\\nThroughout the meal our service as decent; plates cleared quickly but a bit too much time between courses (and it was not terribly busy), our water glasses were kept full, pretty standard stuff. But after dropping over $80 on First Bite courses that left me feeling highly unsatisfied both in quality AND quantity, and a waitress who I felt earned about half the tip money I left, I will not be coming back.\\n\\nI also want to make a note that this was, from what I gather, NOT an isolated incident of a waitress having a bad night or the kitchen being \\"off.\\" A couple coworkers went there last Saturday and had a similar experience, to the point that I apologized profusely when I heard about their frustrating dinner and feel personally responsible for their waste of what could have been a nice evening.\\n\\nSorry Arugula.

It would have been much better with real cheddar cheese and not the fake \\"cheese roll up\\" I had gotten. The enchilada sauce was homemade and was good. It was not too greasy.

Last visit, very recently, some friends and I went here after having dinner at another restaurant nearby. We wanted drinks and desserts. Had to wait for a table so we got drinks at the bar. When our table was ready, we sat and asked for the dessert menu, only to have the waitress tell us she'd have to ask if we could do that. Um...what? Manager came over a few minutes later and told us that they couldn't serve us just dessert and that the table was needed for people who were ordering dinner. \\n\\nNow, they weren't rude, were apologetic, and we didn't make an issue of it, but at the same time it felt very dismissive. We were already holding at least $40-50 in drinks from the bar, and would have ordered probably another $50 worth of desserts, eaten, and gotten out of there pretty quickly. Or maybe dropped another $50 in drinks if we were going to linger. Either way, I'm not sure why the restaurant didn't see us as valid enough customers. \\n\\nWe finished our drinks in the bar area and left about 10-15 min later. The best part?

After that she told my friend they were out of pulled pork and when my friend tried to order a salad with salmon (both of which are on the menu) the waitress was unsure if the kitchen could do that. As a server myself, it seems unreasonable to not know what simple modifications your restaurant can do. Afterwards, the salmon came out raw and they had to make her a new dish. While this was all happening we weren't asked if we would like something else to snack on or if we would like another drink. We had to keep asking for things instead of being asked if we needed anything else or if everything was okay. The nail in the coffin was when our bill came and the suggested tips were all wrong.

While the ambiance and character of this little restaurant was nice, everything else was sub par. The food, the presentation, and the service was all sub par. We ordered cocktails and waited for what seemed to be an eternity for our drinks to arrive. When our appetizers arrived my frog legs and escargot were bland and tasteless.  There was no presentation at all. It looked like somebody had just dumped some food on the plate and called it a day. The same with the entrees. No presentation at all. I had the venison, it was 3 small pieces of meat with some sauce over it and a pile of overcooked miss-mash of vegetables. Just very ordinary and plain. My wife had the duck. She had ordered it medium well because she was afraid of eating undercooked meat while she is pregnant. The duck came out medium rare. She sent it back. When the waiter brought it back to her it looked like they had dumped the food from one plate to another plate and the new plate had a big chip in it. My empty cocktail glass sat on the table the entire time we were there even though it was empty after the appetizer. For dessert we had the apple tarte tatin and the fresh raspberry tart. The apple tarte tatin was the poorest excuse of a tarte tatin I have ever seen. The apples were very mushy and they were not peeled. You were pulling stringy pieces of apple skin from your mouth since it was inedible. Both desserts looked like somebody crapped on the plate and covered it with a mountain of whipped cream. My wife order tea and they brought her Lipton tea. The saucer had a big chip in at as well. One would think that with the prices and the type of restaurant this is that you would receive much better. You shouldn't get plates with chips, the food should be nicely presented, you should get more attentive service and they should have nicer teas than plain old Lipton. We will never be going back, big waste of money!!!  Oh and chef, if you read this go and look at the old French cookbooks that are on the table upstairs by the bathrooms and read the recipes for all the apple desserts. What do they all have in common? You MUST peel the apples !!!!"},{"name":"Local No 7","address":"2316 Main St, Ste A","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic food. Fast and fresh. Wait staff was great also.

The reason why I give 2 stars is because the restaurant likes to charge you for everything. For example I ordered some chilaquiles which they charged me extra for chicken and avocado. Normally chilaquiles already come with this, plus the waiter told us if we wanted some cream, which is supposed to come with the chilaquiles. The waiter handed us a small cup of cream which was the size of an ant. When we received the check they even charged us for the cream 1$ , It is extremely disturbing when you realize the restaurant is stealing your money. The quality is good but come on! 15$ for chilaquiles??? I can make them even better and for less. The waiter did not even tell us of the extra charges. I will not be coming back to el naranjo ever again, It is disrespectful to find places that abuse\\nthe costumer, I am not the first person I know that has had this issue with the restaurant.

Upon entering we were greeted by the hostess. The restaurant was in no means packed which we were surprised. The hostess asked us to give her a moment and went to speak to another associate to see where she could seat us. When she came back she asked us to follow her and as we proceeded to do so, the server who would turn out to be our server screams from across the room to her to advice the following \\"I am not finn'in to serve all the way on that side\\". The hostess then walks back and has us follow her to a row of booth's close to the entrance across from a group of ladies and in front of another set of patrons. We stand back as our server angrily wipes a wet cloth over the table and doesn't dry it off as she explains to the hostess that she is not supposed to be cleaning. As we are seated by the hostess we notice that the table is so wet that the menu's stick to it and the booth seats have oil on them. But at this point given her attitude we were scared to ask for a dry cloth to dry the table and wipe the seat. After the menu's were dropped on the table we sat there for a while looking through until our server returned to take our drink orders and ask about appetizers. We ordered our appetizer and our drinks were a simple strawberry lemonade and a Coke. After some time our waitress came back to take our entree order. We waited again. Our appetizer was brought with no extra plates. Our waitress noticed this and said loudly \\"I will get you some plates, I didn't know that I had to get you plates too\\". The strawberry lemonade was placed on the table along with the side plates. We looked around and waited but still no Coke. Finally after some time of eating our appetizer our server stops by to ask if everything was okay and we let her know that the Coke was never delivered. She quickly went to get that and bring it to the table. When our entree's came we thought that this would be the turn around and the meal would make up for it. We were sadly disappointed. The Tilapia with rice that my mother ordered was far from perfect. The fish was cooked and tasted great but the rice was so under cooked that you had to be careful that you didn't crack a tooth. It was during our meal that we noticed the tables around us had gotten biscuits and our waitress had never bothered to ask us if we wanted or to even bring them to the table. While eating the servers huddled around talking loudly and acting very unprofessionally. We just shook our heads and ate as fast as we could to get the experience over with. As we continued eating the table next to us finished up their meal and asked for boxes. Our same waitress asked them if they would like biscuits to take home so I looked at my mom and said we will just ask for some when we are leaving. Our waitress did not come back until it was time to give us boxes to take the rest of our meals home and then asks us if she gave us the credit card receipt to which we let her know that she had not brought the check yet. I asked her for the extra biscuits to which she replied \\"ill have to check if we have any left\\". When she returned she brought a little bag with just two biscuits as apposed to a box full that she gave to the table next to us. We paid for our meal and rushed out not wanting to spend another minute there. \\n\\nThis used to be one of my favorite chain restaurants to visit but the last few visits that I have had has been disgusting.  I have lost my love for this restaurant and to be honest the $67 including tip was not worth that experience at all. Had I known it was going to be like that, I would have dined somewhere else. The over all feel that we got from our server was that she didn't want to serve us. We looked at how she treated other other patrons and it was vastly different. I am not sure if she was just having a bad day or was tired but regardless, no customer should be treated in that manner and the amount of unprofessional behavior that was displayed should never be allowed by management.\\n\\nWhile this is not a 5 star restaurant, you are still paying for service and I would hope that management would at least train their servers better. \\n\\nService with a smile has certainly gone out the window for this location.  Do not go there. Do yourself a favor and drive to a different location if you really want to scratch that Red Lobster Itch."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Updating again - I haven't ordered togo since last time so I don't know, but dine in is always good so I had to update.

The menu was filled with items I liked. I had a grilled cheese and avocado sandwich with mushroom soup. The soup was amazing. I was so hungry I dip into it a bit early and burned my tongue, but I was over it in about 5 minutes. The space was small with an order counter and a place to grab napkins, utensils and drinks.

The first time I left thinking the bill was outrageous and the venison au proivre was worth it.  \\n\\nI went with my fiancee on a Friday night.  The place was oddly quiet.  A very professional waiter took our orders and brought us our wine.  Everything seemed good in the world.  The molasses cornbread was delish and moist, although the butter was about as plain as it comes.  Not much flavor.  The 2 glasses of beaujolais were just right.  \\n\\nThen, things started to slide downhill.  We asked for water and it took forever to come out.  Our appetizers were delivered, but there was a mix-up with one and the correct dish was not delivered.  The brown bean soup was excellent.  Deep meaty flavor and very easy on the eye too with a dark brown color and flecks of black (not sure what it was, but it was good).  The ricotta crepe with shrimp was a huge disappointment.  This may not be the restaurant's fault; perhaps the dish is meant to be bland, limp and aesthetically unappealing.  Perhaps.\\n\\nEntrees were a head-on brook trout with risotto and the venison au poivre.  The venison was again very tasty with just the right amount of properly prepare au poivre and cooked to perfect tenderness, especially when paired with my 2nd glass of beau.  The side of veggies was unimaginatively strewn about, but tasted just fine.  The trout was delicately prepared as it should be, but lacked the flavor we had hoped to see.  My fiancee took about 4 bites and was ready to go home.  I was hoping someone would refill my water or at least come by to ask if i wanted something else to drink.\\n\\nWalnut pie for dessert didn't disappoint, but also didn't wow us.  coffee was rich and refilled without request.\\n\\nBottom line: service was professional but had a few hiccups, which is odd since the place was far from busy.  the food was a bummer with only two tasty dishes, two letdowns and 1 unremarkable dessert.  the bill was $200.  When you pay $39 for an entree, $14 for a bowl of soup, and $12 for a slice of pie, you expect it to be kickass and the service should match.  Water should be topped off frequently, the wrong dishes shouldn't be set upon the table, and you should leave thinking that $100 per person was earned by the restaurant.  sadly, this was not our experience.  only the venison, soup and cornbread earned the 2 stars.\\n\\nIf you're looking for French food that can be just as tasty,  head around the corner to Pierrot on Cambridge St.  If you want fine dining with a romantic flair, head to Toscano's or the South End.  If you want excellent venison au poivre, bean soup and molasses cornbread, go to the Hungry I."},{"name":"New Era Cafe","address":"4600 Rockbridge Rd","city":"Pine Lake","stars":"4","text":"I've lived in Ethiopia for the past year and a half and can honestly say that the Ethiopian selections I had at New Era Cafe taste very home made and authentic.

The vegetables were very fresh, collards not overcooked. The person working even made us a special order of delectable fir fir upon request, since it was not on the menu. The relaxing and bright atmosphere, soft Ethiopian music and free wi-fi was a plus. The only thing that surprised me was the limited selection of Ethiopian dishes and the injera was noticeably mixed with something other than teff (maybe wheat), perhaps due to the difficulty of making traditional injera in the U.S. \\n\\nOn the other hand, there is a wide selection of western food (from chicken nuggets to cheese steaks) that seemed a bit out of place.

Not winning us over I might add.  \\n  We ordered some food, sat, talked for a bit and noticed it was taking a while for our order to arrive.  I looked around and the place was not packed, there were some large tables, but the kitchen could not have been busy.  It was later, most people had already had their food.  So, we wait it out a little longer.  Finally it arrives and my sandwich was not very warm, meaning the waitress had done it again.  She had proven to me she was unable to deliver food or beverages in a decent amount of time. \\n  After more chat I asked my friend how she liked the experience so far, since she had never been.

If he wanted to take something off the bill, he should have just done it, not asked the customer if we wanted him to.

We said we wouldn't go back.\\n\\nBut alas, we did, last Sunday night for happy hour and snacks. What a mistake. The service was even worse than the first time.

If Franklin's is a 100, then La is a 99.5. No shame in scoring this high on my palette. \\n\\nSecond to last stop during my Austin trip and it did not disappoint. The day we were flying out, my wife and I decided to stop by one last coffee place to try and noticed while driving by around noon that the La food truck had no line on this drizzly gray Wednesday. What did that mean? Adventure tangent time! We found parking in the nearby neighborhood with the hope that they had not run out of food and high-tailed it over there. (All week we had seen long lines when driving by.)\\n\\nWhen we arrived we waited behind two people and then ordered a half pound of brisket and a soda. (Some of the other meats had sold out by then.) We were served by friendly folks who offered us samples of brisket to try while waiting. Our reaction? ::Chew, chew, swallow, look at each other, smile sheepishly, shake head at how ridiculous that tiny morsel of meat was:: Paying was easy via credit card. \\n\\nOnce we got our food, we headed to the eating area full of picnic tables. Some had a canopy overhead, but those were taken, but we were able to find a spot sufficiently dry enough. We finished off our three slices of brisket like ravenous wolves, and the smiles and head-shaking continued. Such a charming, fulfilling BBQ experience.\\n\\nNearby were a set of white picnic tables with Sharpies for people to leave notes and doodles behind.

Every single time I've had sushi (nigiri) here, the rice have ALWAYS come apart when picking the sushi up with chopsticks (no exceptions).

I've had their teriyaki through their dinner combo specials twice, and both times you can tell that the items were not freshly prepared.  The chicken was dry and clearly had been microwaved, since the teriyaki sauce remained sandy and pasty in texture. The beef was also dry, and the sauce came out the same way.  Needless to say, I just stuck with the sushi on other occasions.\\n\\nGiven the amount of quality sushi places we have in town, the chefs at Sushi Yoi should step up their game. It's clear that they've just taken a crash course on Japanese cuisine/sushi and decided to open up this establishment, without going through adequate apprenticeship under proper sushi chefs (sushi chefs in Japan spend their first several years just making rice!).\\n\\nI guess you get what you pay for at Sushi Yoi.

The hostess is very sweet and her English is good enough that communicating is not a struggle.\\n\\nAfter two visits (both \\"to go\\"), I think that the food is OK (meaning, \\"better than nearby Taco Bell and worth spending more\\"), but I can't get excited about it.  My family seems to enjoy it, and cheese dip certainly improved my burrito, but I can't say that I've been \\"wowed\\".  Taco and plain burrito were a little bland.  Chips were a little too perfect, in a \\"bought in a bag\\" kind of way, and lacking taste.  On the other hand, salsa was pretty good, the chicken burrito was a hit with my wife and the enchilada sauce has some nice zing.  Judging from other reviews, I will have to stray beyond the numbered specials next time.\\n\\nWhen we're too tired or busy to cook, we'll definitely go back.

The hollandaise was outstanding, as was the egg. A fairly nice start. \\n\\nFor the main event, I opted for the candied pork belly, served with collard greens. The greens had a nice texture, not overdone, but they needed a bit more zing. I asked if they had any pepper sauce (a must, in my opinion), but alas. However, that pork belly - wow. I've had pork belly numerous times before, but this was definitely the best I've ever had.

It's just ok. I've been here a couple times and it's just your average run-of-the-mill teriyaki place. The only difference is this one is located in St. John's. \\nThis last time I ordered the spicy Beef Yakisoba. Wife in tow, she had the Shrimp Tempura. Typically, on teriyaki-type dishes, these places overload the teriyaki sauce in which almost kills whatever other flavors are in your food. This time I ordered without added teriyaki after the cooking. Surprisingly, didn't taste much flavor at all. Just bland. Ended up adding some soy sauce and siracha to make it have more flavor and spice (maybe I have horrible taste buds)? \\nAnd, of course....there's also the filler ratio...which was typical as well. the 60-70% filler, 10-15% veggies, and 10-15% meat. The meat game for me at this place was closer to 10% or lower, in which, I think is pretty shady considering you will spend close to $30 for two people with tip, a drink, and appetizer. The amount of meat served on my dish was the equivalent of maybe 3-4 thinly sliced pieces of roast beef, cooked and chopped up to a crumble that laid thinly on top of the noodles.\\nI will say that the customer service is good as the person was attentive, patient, and brought our food to our table with a smile.\\nBeing that the whole Asian fusion/teriyaki scene here in Portland seems to be a bit saturated since I can count at least 4 in my relative neighborhood alone. This place definitely hits below the mark as far as taste, quantity, and even maybe quality for me...but that's just my opinion. Would I come here again? Yeah, maybe, if I were in a pinch and wanted to go someplace nearby that served Japanese grill.\\nOtherwise, I usually go to a place in the Hollywood area at the Rose City Food Park for Japanese grill. A place called Surabiya. Great food/flavor, relatively the same price, and the filler ratio is a little bit better.....best of all (unlike most teriyaki places) it is open on Sunday after a nice workout! :-)"},{"name":"Cedar's Restaurant","address":"7732 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Amazing!

Good peach/berry pie and not at all too sweet like some GF places - although the crust appeared to have coconut in it, which I wasn't terribly thrilled with because of the texture, but fortunately it didn't detract from the flavor.

As always the staff were friendly and welcoming, and seemed genuinely happy to see us.\\n\\nWe sat in my favourite part of the restaurant, the enclosed patio at the front. I just love that place - it's so cosy with only a handful of tables, and gets a lot of natural light. Some lovely jazz was playing just loud enough that I could hear Norah Jones, but not so loud that I couldn't hear people around me.\\n\\nThe best part of Lupo by a landslide is the food. The Chef, Julio, has so much pride in his work and is an absolute perfectionist - you can see this reflected in each and every dish; from his daily specials (the sable fish is a favourite of ours, he marinates it in some orange jus that is subtle yet brings out such intense flavours) to the regular menu; he even makes the foccaccia loaf in house and I had to stop myself after 3 slices because I knew I wouldn't be able to eat my meal.\\n\\nThis of course resulted in us having more dishes than we could possibly consume, just wanting to try each and every creation, and then some. The highlights were an octopus carpaccio served with a delicious medley of root vegetables, the house-made ravioli, the meatballs with polenta, the fresh burrata, the tenderloin, the rack of lamb, and save room for dessert because the house-made espresso gelato with the chocolate torte was to die for. Honestly, I don't know how I made it out of there alive after all that delicious food. By the time I got to my main I had eaten so much that I couldn't finish my perfectly cooked (medium rare) rack of lamb. Luckily, they packed it up for me and I just had it for lunch.\\n\\nThe short version of the above is this: Lupo has consistently provided an above-average fine dining experience, be it as a party of two, six, or 20. It's absolutely a special occasion, treat-yourself kind of establishment (unless you have more money than you know what to do with) but for the price point, in my opinion, it's the best in the city amongst its peers, none of whom are equal to it."},{"name":"Jade Sushi & New Asian","address":"2425 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This was my second visit and I was excited to try more from how good the food was at my last visit. \\n\\nService was good but a little on the slow side.

It can also be a bit crowded/slow on the take out side but that's expected with such great food. I always order medium spice but their medium is at the top end of how much spice I can handle so if you're spice sensitive I recommend sticking with mild.

Outdoor casual seating with dogs and kids welcome (and very present in sound).  The cuisine is anything but casual though and some serious thought and effort goes into their dishes.\\n\\nMy overall impression is the experience at Contigo is pretty cool and it is definitely a good place to hang out at.  I think you will have the best experience if you mostly stick to cocktails and their charcuterie though.\\n\\nWhat I have tried:\\n\\n$1 Fried Chicken Happy Hour Special - This is awesome.  You get a huge Dewberry Hills Chicken Leg.  It is not the best fried chicken you will ever have but for the price you can't get a much better deal.\\n\\nOx Tounge Slider - This is pretty good although small (3-4 bites).  Nice mild flavor.\\n\\nCrispy Green Beans with Sambol Aioli - I would have personally preferred the aioli to be a lot spicer to offset the milder green beans but this dish was still good.  You could tell that the green beans were extremely fresh.\\n\\nGround pork Crepinette - Juicy and flavorful.  One of the best dishes for me.\\n\\nFoie Gras Torchon - The torchon was good but it was eclipsed for me by the tiny foie gras corndog that had a bright foie gras taste, too bad there was not more of it.  The grilled brioche that I believe came with this dish was great.\\n\\nRabbit Dumplings - This dish was good but I probably wouldn't order it again.  It just wasn't anything special for me although it hit the spot on a cold night for sure.\\n\\nBurger & Fries - This was a solid burger, not the best burger in town for me but definitely great and cooked medium to order.  This challah bun was a perfect complement to the meat.\\n\\nDe-constructed S'Mores - the sweetened lardo was a unique twist on this dessert, but was very full of granulated sugar.  Not for the light hearted.\\n\\nIce Cream - I have tried two speciality flavors: pumpkin spice, and beet and orange.  Both had an odd grainy texture, I did not enjoy it at all.  The flavor was not strong in either.  They need to kick up the flavor before freezing a lot.\\n\\nHousemade Ricotta - This was an unusual dessert but worked well.  Not overly sweet, I enjoyed it.\\n\\nApple Cobbler - This comes out in a small cast iron skillet with some speciality vanilla ice cream flavor that I forget.  The ice cream stole the show here.  It is way better than the stand alone ice creams and had a great flavor."},{"name":"Hy's Steakhouse & Cocktail Bar","address":"637 Hornby Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"It pains me to say this but we have also found Hy's lacking recently.

It's conveniently just across the street.  Unbeknownst to us, The Harp and The Celt are two separate but connected establishments.  We went into the first door we came to, which happened to be The Harp (didn't see the other entrance around the corner to The Celt).  The place was small and cozy, only a few patrons at the bar when we were there.  We sat at a 6-top in the front, which seemed to be the largest grouping there (unless you count the 10 or so guys who later came in a pushed a few tables together for poker night).  Front of the house was looked after by the bartender.  She took care of us pretty well, we stuck out like sore thumbs, I think she didn't know what to make of us (multi-cultural, mixed ages ranging from 20s to 60s, and genders).  We got a round of beers (most of us).  Thank goodness no one ordered anything stupid like an apple martini, I fear they would have thrown us out.  The fanciest we got was a Black Velvet (half Guiness, half Magner's cider).  And don't go and be that person who orders a \\"Black and Tan\\" or an \\"Irish Car Bomb\\" in an Irish bar, lest you want to get your ass handed to you.  Had a couple of Scotch Eggs to share, came quartered with white bread and butter.  I'm used to a little mustard, so asked for and got some sinus-searing Colman's English on the side.  It was a decent egg.

The ambiance is great; very nice and casual.  \\nWe ordered their Charcuterie board (they have a different selection of meat each day), Blackened Red Fish with Quinoa and lentils & Banana Foster Beignets for dessert. 5 stars to each of these items. I am not a big Quinoa fan, but I just loved the preparation here. \\n\\nAs for the missing 5th star: I had a dinner reservation and made a special request asking for anything they could do to help me surprise my husband for his b'day. The person whom I spoke to on phone said they could do a champagne toast and put a candle on the dessert (that we order). I asked him to make a note of it under my reservation, and he assured that it will be done. When we went there for our dinner, as we were being seated, I told one of the waiters about the B'day surprise and he said he would notify our server about it. I waited until our 3rd course, there was no sign of the surprise toast. I started getting anxious and my husband was wondering why I was behaving weird. Finally, after ordering our dessert, I couldn't wait any longer. I went and spoke to their manager, who happened to be checking on the guests at the moment, and he sent the \\"surprise\\" toast to our table. I just couldn't enjoy my meal since I was constantly waiting to surprise my guy and make that night more special.

We were pleasantly surprised how at how small yet busy the restaurant was.  We started out by ordering two Singha beers and the fried spring roll appetizer. We were a little shocked when our $5.00 appetizer that stated we would be getting three fried spring rolls came out. These spring rolls were about a fourth of the size you would get anywhere else- and spend the same amount of money. Seriously, they were no bigger than a cocktail wiener. I wouldn't have been happy to pay $2.00 for them, much less $5.00. Anyways, we received our food, my husband ordered the Panang Curry and I ordered the Pad See Ew. My husbands curry was divine- full of sweet potatoes, white potatoes, snap peas, green beans, squash and chicken served with a side of jasmine rice. He got his curry mild- so I can't make a comment on the spiciness. My Pad See Ew was probably some of the best I'd ever had. Usually when I order this dish, I expect a pile of wide noodles, some chicken, broccoli and egg all topped with that delicious sweet soy sauce. This was not the case here.

We made a reservation for 7:45PM on Sunday and were promptly seated. The restaurant is small and cozy, and was still rather full despite the fact that dinner was on the later end for us. All the prime dinner times were booked up already when I made the reservation maybe three or four days in advance, so plan ahead accordingly.\\n\\nThe rolls that were provided were warm and perfectly baked--crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. I was pleased. Quality of the complimentary bread is so important! My boyfriend ordered the Rollati and I ordered the Sunday Macaroni because I just had to based on all the other reviews.\\n\\nThe Sunday Macaroni is pricey at $28 or $29 (can't recall now), which is higher than what the online menu states, but worth every. effing. penny. The dish is huge! I ate maybe a third of it and packed up the rest for another meal. The meatballs were really great and the perfect amount of fatty. The beef rib literally fell off the bone and tasted similar to how the beef tastes in beef bourguignon. The pork sausage was good--a lot less memorable than the other two meats, but somehow the one that I finished first. And the whipped ricotta--oh man. Why is whipped ricotta not a thing ALWAYS? Literally amazing texture and taste.\\n\\nMy boyfriend also enjoyed his rollati a lot, and said it was one of the more unique pasta dishes that he's had.\\n\\nAll in all, our dinner at Carmelina's was incredibly enjoyable and I am now finally realizing that Boston does have some pretty great Italian restaurants.

Staff are attentive without hovering.\\n- House margarita is pretty darn good & not overpriced.  The grapefruit version however was disappointing.\\n- Chips & salsas are nice, but not exceptional.\\n- Tuna ceviche app is terrific.  Best thing I had all night.  Get it.\\n- Both the shrimp & carnitas tacos were quite good, but a bit small @ $8 for two.\\n- The chicken mole entree was not good.  Mole needs to be cooked for hours to mellow the flavors & bring out the richness in the combo of ingredients.  This one tasted 'thin', like it had only been cooking for  maybe  1/2 hour.\\n\\nOverall, Barrio Cantina has a higher fun quotient & lower tab than its sister downtown restaurant, Tico.

Most of the rodizio style meats that were served were a bit on the dry side but I think it had to do with the fact that they weren't too busy at the time and the meats were kept on warm a bit too long.

Aside from the rodizio, the buffet bar has a decent selection of fresh salad and veggies to compliment the meats. There's also a short row of hot foods including beef roast, chicken parmesan, plantains, white and yellow rice, and some soups or dishes with lots of broth.

They serve Thai food  all made-to-order in an open kitchen which is a bonus. They cater to a lunch crowd consisting of workers in the area and while they have a modest seating area, most of the patrons take their food to go back to the office. I have tried their chicken fried rice, chicken pad thai and thai grilled chicken on a green salad. They were all pretty good but the rice was divine! Drawbacks: they get in a decent lunch crowd and since everything is made to order, it can take a little while but they accept phoned in/ faxed in orders so I would definitely recommend that to cut out the bulk of your wait. Also, the food is better quality than most and the prices reflect this so it is little pricier than most take-out Thai restaurants (i.e., $10.50 for an order of chicken fried rice).

We ordered a half slab (7 pieces I think) and I must say that I was dancing inside when my Lil Sis allowed me to have the 7th rib. The ribs were meaty, ungreasy, and tasted delicious with their BBQ sauce. However, they were so good I could have eaten them without any sauce! I am a huge rib fan and have had my share of ribs in my lifetime and these were probably some of the best I have ever had. The food servers and truck attendants (not sure what else to call them) were really friendly as well.

There was no line and we were immediately seated. I would give this place 2.5 stars but 3 stars because of the service. We had the collard green spring rolls, mac n cheese, collard greens, midnight train, sweet tea, and uptown. I originally wanted fried corn, but they ran out. That sucked.\\n\\nThe collard green spring rolls looked nice but really lacked flavor. I had to constantly use the chili dipping sauce. If not, the dish itself was bland.\\n\\nThe mac n cheese was alright. The cheese on the top was not crispy and the portions were very small compared to the price you pay. This was true for the collard greens as well. In addition, the collard greens were quite biter and not much flavor beyond that.\\n\\nThe midnight train was just okay. The waffles were soft on the outside and inside. I believe that the outside should be crispy/crunchy while the inside being soft. The chicken was poorly made as well. The skin was not crispy at all. However, majority of the meat were tender and juicy, only the meat around the head of the wing was dry. I was very disappointed with the chicken and waffles. It really lacked quality control.There was no special seasoning of the skin either. \\n\\nIn summary, the subpar quality of food could be due to the issue of closing time but i feel that good food should be put out regardless of time to closing.\\n\\nThe sweet tea and uptown were alright, nothing to rave about.

This place is a game changer and I don't think I can return to San Diego or any other city and have BBQ in the same light anymore.\\n\\nFirstly, every Texan-visiting-noob will go to Texas and try to narrow down which BBQ places to go to, taking lines, popularity, and the limited amount of time they have into consideration. I'm sure everyone thinks of Franklin's BBQ first when coming to Austin, which myself and my entire group also did, but given our limited amount of time there and knowing the notorious 4-5 hour+ wait that is inevitable at Franklin's, we investigated and found the next best thing, la Barbecue.\\n\\nNot sure if this is entirely true, but I heard that la Barbecue is owned by the same management as Franklin's BBQ, so the preparation of meat here is similar. There was still a line to wait for la Barbecue, but instead of 4-5+ hours, it took our group a little over 1 hour to get our food and we were about 20-30 people into the line I'm guessing? One must take largely into consideration that this is a food truck too, which means less working people in the food truck meaning probably slower to get your food in comparison to a bigger restaurant such as Franklin's AND limited amounts of meat that the food truck can hold meaning food may run out more quickly. Being 20-30 people into the line, the BBQ Beef Ribs were sold out almost immediately, but don't fret because all the other meats are DELICIOUS as well! \\n\\nWe ended up trying the BBQ Pork Ribs, the Pulled Pork, and the Brisket with a side of bread, potato salad, beans, and cole slaw. Seriously, every bite of everything we had - Just wow. ESPECIALLY the BBQ Pork Ribs and the Brisket. My entire group was amazed at how it literally melts in your mouth and right off the bone. It was totally worth every second of the wait and it's also awesome because the place provides the crowd with free beer! They have kegs of coor's and other beer for those waiting. I just loved the feel of community togetherness with people waiting with their dogs, their lawn chairs, with beers in hand. What I really appreciated about this place too is that the dudes working inside the truck are so patient and friendly, even with the smoldering heat and long lines. They gave us some free samples when we were at the window and were welcoming, which was nice! There are also bench tables outside next to the food truck, where you and your group can feast on your meal. \\n\\nUgh, I seriously loved it. This place really made me love Austin so much more than I already did. Perhaps one day I'll be able to try the legendary meats at Franklin's BBQ, but for now, la Barbecue did a damn great job."},{"name":"Pho Green Papaya & Deli","address":"402 SE Martin Luther King Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Full disclosure: all I get is Luc Lac steak or Luc Lac tofu.

Louie's is built out of a small end portion of a strip center and has OK visibility from Cemetary Rd.  There is a patio in the front yard and the entrance is in the back.  \\n\\nUpon entering the restaurant around 12:30PM I was fairly quickly greeted by my soon-to-be server and was seated at a booth by myself.  The interior reminded me of a cafeteria or plain diner, with carpeting and a bar with one television.  The specials were written on a board next to the bar.  On the menu, these specials were not mentioned, but then I noticed they were just regular parts of the menu.  About four other tables were present in the fairly open large dining room.\\n\\nI started off with an iced tea and soon ordered a cup of chipotle crab chowder.  The chowder soon arrived at my table.  It appeared to be more of a bowl and I dug in.  A creamy rich broth was surrounded by potatoes, celery, and onion and a hint of chipotle and real crab meat.  There were no chunks of crab and the chipotle was not too spicy.  A very hearty and tasty soup.\\n\\nAfter perusing the menu I ended up ordering fish tacos grilled.  A few minutes later it arrived.  I was given three corn tortillas filled with lettuce, red onion, a melted white cheese, grilled Tilapia and something that appeared to be a thin sour cream.  On the side black beans over white rice finished off the plate.  Upon eating the tacos I noticed that the Tilapia had a somewhat cajun seasoning on it and were a little salty.  Some fresh cilantro and homemade salsa would have been a good addition.  The dish was just OK.\\n\\nAll-in-all I give my experience three stars.  No lunch menu and the items added up for me.  $2.25 for iced tea, $4.50 for chowder, and $9.99 for tacos, $21 with tip.  Never offered any chips (which I didn't need anyway) and it was a little warm inside the dining room with the outside doors open.  Good service, OK food, just an average overall experience.

I had the nopal relleno which was a chicken breast sandwiched between two cactus paddles, seasoned with lime and garlic, covered with melted cheese and surrounded by some sort of delicious orange sauce. Everything was cooked just right: The chicken was juicy but lean and flavorful from the spices and the cactus paddles weren't chewy or mushy.

It was a nice mix of veggies in the curry, but there was just no flavor at all.  This place doesn't hold a candle to even the most mediocre Thai restaurants in Atlanta, and $20 for a soup and curry of this quality is excessive, to say the least.

He gave no acknowledgment of our existence. My first inclination was to flash my Yelp badge and explain that we were there as expert XO sauce testers. Instead I walked over the the fish tanks like a geeky white guy, not a stretch for me,  and acted like I was about to put my face and hands on the tanks. Mr. Owner hung up and seated us. We got slightly better treatment from the staff except they gave us forks automatically, nbd.\\nThings changed for the better once we ordered. We started with Crab and Fish Maw soup($9.95 the small was plenty for 2). They brought the red vinegar and white pepper before I had to ask which cancels the fork slight. The soup was excellent. Plenty o' crab meat but not too much. Very subtle flavors, possibly the best I've had in the last 6 months. We tried the Seafood in XO sauce ($17.95), as this was our mission. The plate was full of Sea Scallops, Shrimp and Squid with fresh Snap Peas and Carrots. I was duly impressed with the XO sauce but not blown away. We rounded things out with an order of  Salty Fish with Eggplant Sizzling Hot Pot ($10.95) and a plate of Singapore Rice Stick. The former had very little fish and lots of Chinese Eggplant. It was piping hot and the sauce was quite good. The Street Noodles ($ 6.00) had an uneven distribution of curry and had to tossed violently. I eat this dish 2-3 times a month and I use it as a benchmark. There were succulent small shrimp that were not the previously dried variety, crisp vegetables, scallions, thin slices of  pork like you would expect. Again this was one the better Singapore Rice Stick/Street Noodles I've had this year. Mr. Owner's attitude changed 1000% when he brought our credit card slips, dropping $50 on lunch with no booze will do that for a proprietor.

This one has a unique layout because it's located in a corner stall with two ordering counters and two cash registers.  Both aren't always open though.\\n\\nThe service is good, but the quality and taste of the food is not so good.  I know we're talking about Chinese food court food which is already mediocre, but there's still room for improvement, especially when you consider the in-mall competition (e.g. Malibu Wings).  Walk around and try samples.  You'll see what I mean.\\n\\nBistro 7 runs a popular $5.99 special which nets you two meats, two sides, and noodles or rice.  The portion size is generous, so it's a lot of food and a pretty nice value.  Some of the more unique foods I've seen for sale include Indian curry chicken and tandoori chicken.  You wouldn't expect to find Indian food for sale at a Chinese joint.  I guess they want to compete against the Indian stall as well.\\n\\nThe best item I've tried is the honey chicken.  It's sweet and deep-fried, so it appeals to the masses and is hard to go wrong with.  It's crispy and tasty.  I think the honey chicken is what the employees on the floor give out as free samples to lure customers in.  You can actually sample any of the chicken if you ask.  They'll stick a piece on a toothpick and hand it over the food line to you.\\n\\nThe lo mein noodles here look strange.  They have a peculiarly odd pink hue to them.  I normally like to order lo mein noodles at Americanized Chinese joints such as this place, but the noodles look a little too unsettling to me.  Rice is the way to go.  I like how the rice includes veggies like corn and green beans.  The other stalls don't include as many veggies in their rice.  More on the green beans shortly.\\n\\nThe noodles or rice are placed in the main compartment of the disposable Styrofoam eating container.  This means less room for the meats, which are also placed in the same compartment.  However, don't worry, as the servers still manage to find a way to pile on heapfuls of sauce-drenched meats.\\n\\nSpeaking of sauce-drenched meats, if you order the teriyaki chicken, be prepared for some soggy rice (or noodles).  Same goes for any of the other \\"liquidy\\" meats.  It'd be nice if there was a better way to separate them, but you are paying for quantity over quality.\\n\\nLike the strangely pink lo mein noodles, the green beans have an unnatural bold green color to them.  It wouldn't surprise me if some sort of preservative and/or artificial food coloring were added to the original product.  Despite the unusual color, the green beans generally taste fine.\\n\\nIn a pinch, Bistro 7 works, but there are better options in the food court."},{"name":"Hecho En Mexico","address":"2101 Montopolis Dr, Unit  23","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Sat at the bar, which is oddly about 12 inches taller than normal.

She used the wrong end of the jigger, giving us essentially a triple sec margarita with a quarter ounce of tequila. We drank it anyway. Another table ordered a strawberry margarita, which wasn't made with strawberry puree. It was made with a strawberry syrup like you would pour on a snow cone. Watermelon was the same.\\n\\nOrdered the flameado. It was awesome. Blue corn tortillas reminded me of Mexico. The complimentary chips (store bought) and salsa were ok. Would've been way better with a good tortilla chip. If you aren't going to make your own, HEB makes really good tortilla chips. These tasted like Tostitos or something.\\n\\nI got a relleno with pork, almonds, raisins. It was ok. Nothing great. Bf ordered shrimp tacos. I think the shrimp was ground or minced and mixed with a creamy sauce. It had the texture of a tuna fish sandwich. It was so gross. We assumed the shrimp would be whole or whole-ish. But it was a pasty pile of pink glopped into a (store bought) flour tortilla. Our server took it away for us and offered something else. He got the cheese enchiladas with Verde sauce and loved them.  \\n\\nTrainer guy comes back out to help her make drinks for another table. He continuously had his hands in his longish hair.

I had read the reviews of this place before I came as I had not been here before and wanted to know what the food was like.  I read so many reviews about how their food is seriously greasy, so when we sat down, I actually grabbed 6 napkins prior to even ordering and made a joke about how I was going to end up needing more.  I ordered the regular hamburger and tater tots (which I have not had for quite a while).  The waitress was very friendly, the food arrived at the table in good tiime, and everybody's order was made correctly.  The food was nowhere near as greasy as I had been expecting it to be (from having read all the reviews on this site).  The hamburger was just fine, although you don't get a lot for toppings.  The tater tots were a nice surprise.  I was really expecting these tots to be little grease bombs (again, from having read all the past reviews of the food here being super greasy), but the tots were cooked perfectly.  I'm not kidding, there was no grease at all left on my fingers from the tots.  To finish this review out, everyone at the table agreed that the burgers were good (we all ordered hamburgers or cheesburgers), and although the burgers weren't the largest burger you will ever get, and won't have a lot of toppings, they taste fine, and reallly weren't that greasy at all.  I personally recommend the tater tots as they tasted fresh and had a crisp crunch to the outside.  Maybe our group just got lucky and we got here on a great service day, but our overall experience was great for what this little restaurant is.  Do not come here looking for a 5 star restaurant, but if you are looking for a decent burger at a decent price with really friendly service, by all means come here.

The Shumai was okay ($2.95 for 5 small pieces)...but not like the pork & shrimp dumplings that you may be familiar with from dim sum restaurants.  These were small, fried shrimp balls, basically.  The freshness of the sushi rolls was surprising, considering that they came from inside a cart and were served on a tray much like HEB sushi.

Overall, I think this is a great concept and will definitely be back next time I want some sushi without the frills.

We were actually looking to go check out a club in City Walk, but there was a private party going on, so the clubs we wanted to go to were blocked off. However, we probably had more fun at Latin Quarter than we would have at a club. We walked right into the restaurant and sat at the bar to order drinks. One of the first things you notice in Latin Quarter is the theme park-esque atmosphere of the restaurant--with bright colors and a deep blue sky and stars adorning the ceiling. We decided to go along with that and order some over-the-top drinks as well. I ordered a pina colada. And all I can really say about that is that it was the BEST pina colada I have ever had and probably ever will have in my entire life. It tasted like a freakin' milkshake. Although we weren't really there to eat dinner, we all wanted snacks so we decided to go ahead and order some guacamole and chips. Well, next thing we know a chef comes out from the kitchen with this huge mixing bowl on a wheeled tray and starts pouring in olive oil. scooping out fresh avocados, and adding tomatoes, onions, and a ton of other fresh veggies to make the guac right there in front of us!

After my last two experiences, I've decided I'd rather not frequent this place anymore. It's unfortunate, because I had two very good meals here, and the ice cream is also good. The food and service are just way too inconsistent, and many of the workers don't seem to care about either good service or the quality of what they put out. Fortunately, you can get good ice cream at many other places. \\n\\nThere were two straws that broke the camel's back. In one instance, the sandwich was a mess of items I never requested mixed with a few that I did. It was completely random. The bread wasn't well toasted, even though I asked for it to be and emphasized the WELL part. In fact, both slices were mushy and barely even lightly toasted. When I returned the sandwich and asked for my money back, the guy at the counter shorted me a dollar. I tried to explain that he owed me nine dollars and change, not eight, and he kept insisting he had given me the correct amount back. He didn't. I got tired of arguing and took my money to Hapa where they very kindly and unexpectedly gave me a small discount. If you want consistency and really good food, it's sometimes worth it to pay extra and go to a place you can always trust like Hapa. \\n\\nOn my most recent (and last) visit here, I ordered the Shaw's delight with the bagel well toasted. Again, the bagel was barely toasted and cold. The inner part wasn't even lightly browned, nor were the edges. My coworker agreed that it wasn't even lightly toasted. I asked for sprouts, and there were maybe three threads sitting on top. The sandwich was missing the tomato, and enormous leaves of wet lettuce topped the large mound of cheese making it grotesquely slimy. When I mentioned that the tomatoes were missing and the bagel was not well toasted, two employees started to argue with me. My response was that it would be my last time there. After working in high-end restaurants after college, I don't need someone to tell me the difference between well toasted, lightly toasted, and untoasted. I think I get it. \\n\\nWhen I'm spending $12.00 plus for a sandwich or bagel, I want it done the way I request or at least close.

So I had gauzed my expection more or less from the relative best.\\n\\nThis was a typical Korean family restaurant. I couldn't recall the simple menu but it had typical dishes including Bulgogi. They might have added a section recently for tofu stew. The price was obviously much higher with minimal choices in this tourist trap Asian-deprived culture. Tofu stew with beef or pork cost $12 without raw egg ($1 upon request) with 34% less in volume. I paid $8-10 with egg included and regular size near LA.\\n\\nIn California, the rice was cooked and served directly in the tiny clay pot; I usually made rice soup with tea or water out of the burned part in the pot. Here, the steamed rice came in a bowl and the soup came in that small clay pot (used for rice in Cali). There was $2 per additional bowl of rice here.\\n\\nWe had ordered 2 marinated meats for table grill. It priced about $16 for 1/2 lb each. Our waitress threw half the meat on the grill for us immediately. WTF? Was she trying to rush us at 9:15 when the restaurant closed at 10?

Gladys Knight's is apparently one of THE places to go in Atlanta, especially for a self proclaimed connoisseur of fried chicken.  If this is the best fried chicken or soul food Atlanta has to offer, I think someone has been fibbin.  Don't believe the hype.\\n\\nI dont want to waste too many words on this review so I'll try to be brief.\\n\\nArea: This location is in a part of midtown that has a lot of vagrants (for want of a better word).  And they hang out next to the paid parking area adjacent to the restaurant.  It would not have bothered me so much if, 3 of them had not come up to me to try to convince me that there was free parking right down the street.  I don't know, something about that seemed fishy.\\n\\nAmbiance:  It was OK.\\n\\nService: This left a little bit to be desired.  I won't go into the drama of the story, just remember that, you need to have ALL the members of your party present when you arrive at the restaurant, cause they don't do partial seating or something.\\n\\nFood: Did I already say dont believe the hype.  The only good thing I heard was \\"the waffles were top notch\\".  Other than that here's a little list of why this place is alright at best.\\n\\n1. My black eye peas were too salty\\n2. My catfish had entirely too much bread and was too salty (mind you i love salt)\\n3. My friend got maybe half a table spoon of apple butter for something she ordered. And it was OK. Probably from Publix\\n4. The midnight train musta made a couple of stops on its way to Georgia, cause its really nothing to write home about.  If you are from out of town: this dish is not representative of good southern food by any means.  In all fairness it was OK fried chicken. \\n\\nI might have given this place 3 stars, but off the top of my head I can think of 3 places that serve southern food that are hands down better than Gladys K's.

They do not take reservations, so we had about a 15-20 minute wait. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, our server was very friendly and answered all of our questions about the menu.

We ordered family style between the four of us: Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Broccoli, and Chicken Panang Curry with rice.

We viewed the menu on their website, and ordered one of their specialty pies while adding two extra toppings.  According to the website, the total should have been $26.50.  When I picked up the pie, however, my bill was $29.75.  I asked about the difference and was told that the website might not be up to date.  Strange, but ok, fine.  Paid with plastic on their iPad system.  Instead of choosing one of the percentage options, I tried to enter a manual amount of $4.00.  Luckily I noticed that each time I attempted to type in $4.00, the iPad changed my tip from $4.00 to $29.75 when I typed the last zero.  Finally, I just chose 15% because the guy ringing me up was already on to the next customer (1 of 3 in the place).  No thank you, no acknowledgement of any kind upon leaving.  Just an iPad that didn't work very well.\\n\\nSo now I'm home, we open the box, and.......meh.  We ordered the \\"Bella Rossa\\" and there was about one leaf of basil chiffonade with a couple teaspoons of pesto.  Menu listed \\"fresh basil\\" on our pie, but I guess that means a little pesto.  Good thing we're not allergic to nuts!  The menu also advertised the \\"Bella\\" with both their tomato and white sauces, yet we received only tomato.  We added olives to our pizza and were disappointed to find (yes, I counted) six olives chopped in half on an 18\\" pie.  The rest of the pie was fine, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nMostly, I'm just tired of the mediocre $30 pizza standard in Portland.  I don't mean to take it all out on Al Forno, but damn man, it's dough (cheap), tomato sauce (cheap), and cheese (medium expense, especially with Sicilian style).  And I write this as a twenty year restaurant professional who spent several years at a pizzeria that uses quality ingredients.  I don't need or expect expensive ingredients piled to the ceiling, but when I lay down thirty dollars for a pizza, I DO expect more than a sprinkle of toppings.  If I wanted to spend thirty dollars on bread and cheese, I could do a lot better than white bread and mozzarella........"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic.

Good date spot. \\n\\nThe Cons:\\nThe food is not traditional South African food, at all! The one thing I really didn't like was the bunny chow. The bread was dry. Bunny chow is not a bread bowl. It's just a hunk of soft bread with a large scoop of curry on top.The hole in the wall Indian places in South Africa have the best bunny chow. Trying to combine Indian food with other South African cuisine annoys me. I also hate when restaurants try and add a \\"modern flair\\" and claim it as the real thing.

As expected, a typical Stanford's experience (IE: very positive).  My martini which I ordered stirred, was stirred.  Food - great.  Service - great.  Every place has off nights, and we were there for a doozy as below.  I am hopeful the management can keep their team on point.\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\nInitial Review:We have patronized Stanford's locations all over Portland, including the Lloyd Center restaurant.  While the service, food and presentation have generally been well above average our experience on Friday 10/30/15 @ this location fell to the \\"One-Star\\"  level.  Here is why:\\n- Martini ordered stirred, but was shaken and loaded with ice. While I would have been OK with that, I was not OK with the fruit fly floating around in my poorly made $7.00 cocktail. Our waiter made himself scarce after delivering our drinks, so I took the martini up to the bar.  I set it on the bar top, and when the bar tender sauntered up he glanced at the beverage and said, I kid you not, \\"Dive bomber eh?\\".  I had to ask for a replacement after a few seconds of awkward silence.  The Stanford's we know would have com'p the drink.\\n- Fish tacos were, well, ugly.  Overcooked and topped with what looked exactly like a trail of green/brown bird crap that was supposed to be guac.  The rice was undercooked and dry.  Just unpleasant.  Again, not at all like any food we have had at Stanford's which has always been fresh, appealing, and well presented.\\n- The regular margarita was made with a pre-mix that was sticky sweet, and it was served buried under a water glass worth of ice.  Our waiter responded to a request for some fresh lime juice by brining a small quantity of Rose's Lime juice... which is a highly processed bottled lime flavoring that is sweetish.  No help.  Just lazy, and again if it were a $2.00 drink at a dive bar it wouldn't have mattered.. you expect crap.  But not for what Stanford's charges.\\n- Overall wait service was lackluster and infrequent.\\n\\nThis was a very poor showing for Stanford's.

I didn't like that they didn't devein the shrimp, but then again a majority of Chinese restaurants never do. It's also hard to think that this $17.95 dish is worth it, especially getting it as take out, when the mayo sauce becomes clumped together in the crevices of the shrimp.

It's tiny: a few tables and a wrap-around bar with comfy stools.  It's somehow stark and completely decorated with mine paraphernalia: wine bottle partitions, a cork wall, and wallpaper made of wine labels.  We sat at the bar and decided we'd split something to eat to go with the wine.\\n\\nWe both had a small glass of the house blend, which we really liked.  We split the pappardelle with sausage and leeks.  It was good.  Was it amazing?  No.  But it was a solid dish and we had no real complaints.  \\n\\nWe were really excited about dessert, which was described as \\"strawberry millefeuille.\\"  I love mille-feuille in all its permutations, especially in the hot summer months when I want something light.  So, I was surprised when we were presented with something more akin to a strawberry napoleon: 3 tuile cookies sandwiching pastry cream and macerated strawberries.  I was totally bummed.  Where was the puff pastry or at least phyllo?  I really really hate it when food is described incorrectly--if you're going to do a creative spin on a dish, at the very least put the name in quotes or give a description so that I know what I'm paying for.  It was just okay.  I'm not a huge fan of tuile-based desserts, and this was fairly hard to eat, given that you have to strategically break the layers apart.\\n\\nI'd definitely say the place is overpriced, but not by a whole lot.  The problem (or beauty, if you're an entrepreneur) with wine bars is that the markup on wine is ridiculous.  I wouldn't say that selling the glasses of wine in several different sizes actually works for a tasting, given that the cheapest, smallest sizes are around $6 (unless of course you want just one taste, then it's a deal).  A plate of shared pasta, 1 dessert, 1 small glass of wine, and 1 medium-sized glass of wine was about $50 before the tip.\\n\\nI'd probably come back if I was in a group in Beacon Hill and was sharing a bottle or two and wanted a cheese plate.

Oh well.  Sam said his whiskey didn't taste oakey enough, so we asked for a whiskey / bourbon expert to stop over and guide us in the right direction - - in comes James, the GM.  \\n\\nJames knew his stuff alright, he was cool and professional and customer service oriented.  He got Sam the perfect whiskey, and we also wanted something unique and smooth so he also recommended Michter's - - which they just got in and have yet to add it to the menu.

But even those poor unfortunate souls will be ok, as their vegetarian option (yes, they have one) is apparently rather good. I wouldn't know, I stuck with the meat.\\n\\nHave you noticed a theme yet? This place is all about the meat. And it is delicious. The spices and seasoning is heavenly; just smelling the food coming is a treat. This is the kind of place you might want to skip lunch the day of coming here, to save room.\\n\\nIn addition to the meat brought to your table on swords, there are self-serve bars of sides and salad stuff to eat in addition to the all-you-can-eat main course, not to mention some desserts. It's all as delicious as the primary food.\\n\\nBasically, Midwest Grill is delicious. If you love meat you will love this restaurant. They can accommodate larger groups, so you might consider having your next birthday/gathering here.

However, on my last trip to Austin, I discovered a style of Mexican cuisine that even a well-rounded Houstonian pallet might be unaccustomed to.\\n\\nPerched atop a small hill, El Naranjo is hidden away in a residential area, just South of 6th street. The main building was still being constructed during my visit. Until it's completion, a decked out, bright orange trailer is serving as their kitchen. \\n\\nComplimentary to Austin's laid back lifestyle, we were able to BYOB. This is always a plus for me because buying alcohol any place other than the gas station is a rip off. So,  we took our place at the picnic tables. The first dish I received was the mole poblano (shredded chicken with poblano mole.) Now, chicken is chicken, but this mole sauce was culinary enlightenment. I couldn't even guess what they put into this sauce. Either way, it was amazing.\\n\\nAs for a side dish, we tried the guacamole. On the menu it's labeled as 'Best Guacamole Ever' ...I can't really argue. The last thing I ordered was the Veracruzanos molotes. You only get 3 of them after paying $4.25, but damn, they are worth it. The best way I can describe them are corn nuggets, stuffed with black beans and cheese.

I went there today and hoped to give my parents a proper and formal good-bye dinner. This place popped up on Yelp and seemed to be up-scale. The interior seemed to be good enough to suit its rating. The hostess sat us down and we were preparing for a nice meal as usual. And then it all went downhill. We sat there for over 15 minutes and in the meantime over 4 different servers went by. They went in and out of the kitchen multiple times and all seemed to be busy at something. Let's be honest here, there were only like 4 tables, FOUR tables. You know? 4? The number after 3? How hard is it to serve some new customers? More specifically, two of the guys came out of the kitchen, stood there, looked at us, and I gave them this \\"hurry up\\" look, and they just went away. They all seemed they are working for the president, and they are organizing some important international conference. Because they just simply had no time to look at a brand new table and no water or anything other than the menu given by the hostess. If I was the manager, I'd be either crazy and don't care or ashamed of their employees' performance. If you need some tips training your staff, give me a call. And no I won't call the manager, no need to give me a phone number. All details are here. Finally when our waiter came, he asked us what we wanted, we said we are just gonna leave, due to the slow service. He just said \\"okay\\". No apology, no asking for details, no trying to make it better. Bro if he at least said we are sorry for the wait, we probably would have stayed. As we were walking out, the hostess didn't even say anything, and kept working on her national security conference. It must be, because they are just all tooooo busy. I told the guy outside looking at the menu he better go somewhere else if he didn't wanna suffer from hunger, because people inside took forever. Glad I did my share, because a business like this doesn't deserve customers. If you are not capable of serving customers after a certain time, close the door. Don't lure any more victims like us. We all have stuff to do. People, be mindful of their star rating, I doubt how they manage to stay in business with this level of service.

None of the servers tried to move things along. We had to pester the hostess to see what was happening. She said that those patrons were regulars and did that often (Why hasn't management been involved??).  Then, it took almost 40 minutes to be served our food. The restaurant was not busy at this time (nearly 7:15pm), so I don't know what was causing the delay. The food was tasty and prepared well (we had lamb on the rack), but the long waitS made us grumpy and ruined the experience. The server was friendly but never came to refill our water, and we had to ask another waitress to get takeout boxes and our check because we had to go, and our dining experience was wayyy longer than we had planned for.

When we arrived, there was no hostess so we stood around for at least ten minutes before a server greeted and seated us. They didn't appear to be very busy, but we were there for an early brunch at 10:30. The server was plenty nice but a bit clueless - took him forever to bring coffee, then cream came after I requested it twice, and no spoons so we had to use our forks to stir the coffee. A friend ordered an omelet (the egg-white one but she wanted yolks, just liked the toppings that came on the egg white omelet)...the waiter didn't seem to understand her request so she explained it several times (to us, really shouldn't have been as confusing)...when food came of course hers came as the egg white omelet without yolks, and she asked the server if it was full eggs, he said yes then quickly walked off...it clearly was just egg whites. Then he came to refill coffee and skipped two people, we had to flag him down to finish, and even then he grabbed the wrong coffee mug so my friend had to show him which one was hers (again, shouldn't have been confusing, there were only four of us). I got the egg sandwich (it was alright, but nothing special, I wouldn't order it again), my husband got the pancake and egg breakfast (which looked okay, he said his eggs were not great), my friend as you know accidentally got the egg white omelet which she did enjoy, and by far the best order, my friend's fiance got the pancakes with peach compote, pecans and whipped cream. His looked so much better than everyone else's food. All in all, it was a so-so experience, the ambience was the most enjoyable part. The waiter was either new, stoned, or just needed his am coffee...regardless he could use some help.

Probably one of the best Italian meals that I have ever eaten.  The restaurant is an old home, and the ambiance is very relaxed, comforting and romantic.  \\n\\nI started with the Foie Gras and Chicken pate.  It was amazing.  Even the toasted buttered bread has so much flavor.  Since I could not make a decision for just one appetizer, I ordered the prosciutto and salami antipasti.  Also amazing.\\n\\nWith the first two dishes being so good, I was very excited for what was to come.  For my pasta dish, I ordered the Ricotta Gnocci.  This dish was full of flavor.  My wife kept taking spoonfuls of pasta and placing it on her plate.  The sauce had so much flavor.  \\n\\nFor my main dish, I had the sablefish.  I wanted to try this since it is not a fish we see in Hawaii.  I would compare it to a Misoyaki Butterfish.  Great texture, lots of flavor.\\n\\nFor dessert, we tried the Meyer lemon tart.  It was good, but compared to the other dishes it was \\"just okay\\".  \\n\\nOur server brought us a complimentary dessert wine.

We ordered the wings (yum!) and the balsamic glazed grilled chicken dinner.   When my grilled chicken came, I cut into the breast and it was RAW!  It was an immediate turn off for me, you can get seriously ill from eating raw chicken and it's not safe to serve under cooked food to customers.

They need to take the $5 burger bs out of their stores, because it's false advertising. \\"The Best $5 Burger A Man Can Eat\\" is the Little Hamburger. That's it. I have eaten in-store on each occasion the last few times, and this last time was the worst. It seems like no one wants to be there. My burger patties tasted off, like they didn't have seasoning or they were underdone, possibly low-quality beef, not sure. One time I asked for extra A-1 sauce and got sauce on only one side of the burger. One time there was so much mayo it was like they put it on the buns AND the patties - it was disgusting, like a mayo sandwich with cafeteria beef. The price at 5 Guys just isn't worth it anymore, not when there are so many more options out there for a good burger, now, under that price. I don't know if this is a location-specific issue or not, but it sucks. Honestly?

It wasn't cooked long enough for me or the mister and he prefers his pizza not to be too crispy.  I could tell if it were cooked a bit longer it would've been really good.  They also brought out some Nutella bites that were tasty.  Not my thing but he liked them. Service was fine.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich: sausage, arugula, fig jam topped with a fried egg, on a giant buttermilk biscuit. This thing was massive, and really fricken tasty... that fig jam was especially good and totally made the sandwich. The fried egg was cooked and seasoned perfectly, with the yolk running down the sides as I went to take a bite (hard to do, because it was so tall... maybe they could make the sausage patty and biscuit thinner for better bite-to-food ratio?). It comes with a side of skin-on fries, which were crispy and well-seasoned. I think it would help to put a toothpick or two in the sandwich to try and keep it together, as it kept falling apart on me as I ate, but it was definitely worth the mess. Loved this dish, would order it again (and would slather that fig jam over anything).\\n\\nThe boy ordered the chicken and waffles. We both liked them fine, but he felt the waffle batter could use more seasoning, and I personally prefer cornbread waffles as well as boneless chicken (but that's just me).\\n\\nThe side of homefries we split were well-cooked, nicely seasoned crispy potato chunks, which were good for what they were, although I personally prefer some sort of extra umph in my homefries (paprika, or onions and peppers... something to take them out of dinner mode into brunch land). Also, I didn't know my sandwich was coming with a side of fries which is why we ordered the homefries, so we had double starch to eat (so would be helpful to list the fries under the sandwich on the menu). \\n\\nCoffee was decent; the Tortuga (cider cocktail) was delicious. Our waiter was friendly enough; he could have taken our food order a few minutes earlier (but I think he got pulled into a staff meeting?), and could have told us the brunch cocktail menu without us having to ask, but overall no real complaints.\\n\\nI think H&S really has something good going on here, and it's especially nice to see the owners so responsive to their customers both on Yelp and in person. I've been pretty happy with all the food and drink I've tried so far, and I'd come hang out over drinks more often if the bar area wasn't so crowded at night. Also, I have heard from friends that some bartenders are far less friendly/attentive than others, so hopefully the level of service can be raised for all the employees.\\n\\nOtherwise, I still think H&S is a solid neighborhood place for food and/or drink, and I'm still very much a fan.\\n\\n[Update: the Hangover Hash and Florentine Benedict are solid choices as well, and I love those chips that come with the grilled cheese and soup.]"},{"name":"The Metropolitan Club","address":"1210 Boylston St","city":"Chestnut Hill","stars":"3","text":"I know I sound like a shill for this place but I can not help by being impressed at how consistently excellent this restaurant is every time I go there.

The experience was fine, as the waitstaff were decently attentive and kind.  However, the food was not quite up to snuff.  My Media Noche Sandwich--essentially a cubano-style sandwich--came with fried plantains and a sauce that appeared to be a cream-based pico de gallo.  The plantains were quite good, but appeared to have been dipped in too much syrup before fried.  A combination of lighter frying/lighter syrup would have been helpful.\\n\\nAs for the sandwich, it was disappointing.  First of all, the pork loin was dry and in two thin layers.  I would've preferred a thicker cut, moist, and with some garlic seasoning.  Moreover, I couldn't taste the mustard and the cheese was American, not pepperjack as specified on the menu.  Finally, the bread was a touch too thin, though this wasn't a huge problem.\\n\\nOverall, my feelings were mixed.

The texture was very similar to a creme brulee except it has a salted caramel flavor (which in my opinion makes it even better). \\n\\nNow onto the disappointment. The candied pork belly just wasn't what we hoped for. The soy balsamic syrup was just strong enough for the pork belly, but it overwhelmed the collard greens. In my opinion, the collard greens were near inedible! The pork belly was very juicy, but it was also a bit overcooked. For a place that specializes in pork, I was hoping for the pork belly to melt in my mouth. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and I had to work through the leaner meat. \\n\\nThis place definitely isn't one of my favorites, but I'm willing to give it another try.

Protein on protein. mmm.\\n* The biscuit that accompanies the green eggs and ham is quite large and enjoyable. Preparation on the grits was refined, but still wholly southern.\\n\\nThe sides:\\n*Crispy brussel sprout leaves: OK, this was hands down my favorite side, which is a bit shocking because I hate raisins and don't particularly care for brussel sprouts.

The service was some of the worst I have ever received. Our server was a small little guy who wore a hat and once he realized he had messed up on a couple of small things for our table, we were avoided.  The manager came over and helped us three times and I really appreciate that, but after managing restaurants for years, sometimes a manager \\"helping out\\" isn't enough to make the customer happy.  She was a sweet person, and I can't remember her name, maybe Robin...anyways, she should have offered something for free, maybe my sister's fiances Guiness that he waited 15 minutes for.  Anything.  \\n  It costs a restaurant very little to give the customer something small for free but it costs the restaurant a lot more if they start losing business because of problems handled the wrong way.  The food was still pretty good but the Ox tail slider was like half the size as it was last time and I wasn't impressed by the octopus, but the rabbit and dumplings was delicious and so were the green beans.  \\nWe left a $0 tip on $130 tab.

I was super excited to dine here, but was still full from lunch and couldn't order as many dishes and I wanted to. I didn't want to take up a table so asked to sit at the small counter area since I knew I was only going to try a couple of items. The staff is really friendly and accommodating, which made the dining experience that much better. I tried:\\n\\n-Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries (110 Minute Egg, Cold Bearnaise, $8): Yum- a must order for any fries lover. These were nice and crispy, and I loved the savoriness. However, the egg and bearnaise made this dish too rich even for me, so I had to ask for some ketchup for the acidity. \\n-Candied Pork Belly (Collard Greens, Soy Balsamic Syrup, $15): Eh, just ok. This dish was what I expected, and I didn't like that it was just a giant piece of pork belly, which didn't have much of a sear. I also thought it would be a bit sweeter. I wasn't a fan of the collard greens either- skip!\\n\\nThey also had a changing daily menu in addition to the regular menu, with 8 other dishes available the day we went. The menu even included a charcuterie board and even a roasted 1/2 pig's head for $45! I wish I was hungry enough to give the pig's head a try. \\n\\nAlthough I didn't love the pork belly dish, the fries were delicious. Also, their customer service is really top notch- We were running late and called ahead to let them know and they were super sweet and accommodating. Our server was warm and attentive, and you really got the feeling that the staff cared that you had a good meal/experience here. There are indoor seating areas as well as a covered patio and outdoor seating. I would definitely recommend Salty Sow, and hope I have a chance to come back when I'm hungrier.

Secondly, the sauce they use to marinade their chicken with has the perfect amount of sweetness to it for a garlic honey sauce. Their chicken is moist and has a nice smokiness to it, somewhat similar to Koala Moa's for anyone from Honolulu reading this. Their mac salad is also seriously addicting, and that's coming from someone who isn't really a fan of mac salad. I like The Local Grind's rendition of it in particular because it doesn't have that much mayo in it. It's a bit lighter than most mac salads, and has a nice amount of pepper and seasoning.

Several managers (I'm assuming) came over to ask about the food, the drinks, whether we were having a good time.  The waitress also took the bill that had 4 different credit cards with a smile, which is very rare and extremely appreciated!\\n\\nThe drink list was extensive and almost everything we got was great.  The only downsides were that they ran out of one of the beers on tap while we were there, and their mixed drinks were not as up to par as everything else.  \\n\\nThe food was pub food that had been bumped up a few notches.  They are definitely getting creative, which I have to give them credit for, but I think it still needs a bit of tweaking.  Since they're so new, I'm thinking they'll get it down in a bit.  The burger and gazpacho were both very good but pretty spicy (which I happen to like) but they would do well to notify people of it on the menu.  The grilled cheese had good flavors, but was not crispy on the outside, and would be better with a harder cheese instead of the pimento-cheese spread.  The beer bread appetizer was AWESOME, but should probably come with four pieces instead of three (2 slices per person if there's 2 of you, 1 each if there's 4).  \\n\\nTL;DR: Awesome after work place for a few beers and beer bread."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The food was absolutely awesome!! The portion sizes were large and the food was clearly fresh and homemade! I would give the restaurant 5 stars, however, their service was not that good. One of the waitresses attempted to speed up the process of getting us out the door by offering to take our bill and put our card through. When she returned the bill she placed it on the table and walked away. I went to sign it and then realized it was declined. I figured this was due to being out of state (sometimes my bank card sends an alert and I just have to approve it on my phone first), no big deal. But, I was disappointed that she did not let me know and I had to wait to grab our server to ask for help. Then, she came to take our plates and asked if we would like to keep the bottle of wine we purchased, we said yes and she said she'd be right back to grab a cork. She never came back and we were unable to grab our waiters attention to help, so unfortunately we tried to finish up as much of it as we could before leaving. The food really was awesome and I've never left a negative review before but I would have to recommend that they attempt to be more attentive to their guests."},{"name":"Sejuiced Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1958 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Go-to for pre/post yoga fuel or simple, but healthy lunch.

I finished the beverage and a coffee I brought in but the waiter made no effort to remove them. The portions were adequate but not extravagant. The food was not hot.

I got the midnight express (one waffle + four jumbo wings) and she ordered a la carte (one waffle + one thigh + one drumstick).  I thought the chicken was incredible.  The wings were large, plump, and juicy.  The seasoning was very subtle (not sure if they really used much more than a pinch of salt), and it was fried really well.  Great texture, and it tasted great (I couldn't put my finger on it, but I think they must use a different oil than other places... my wife guesses it's peanut oil).  I didn't like the waffles as much... maybe it's just a southern thing, but I like my waffles to be crunchy, whereas these waffles (similar to Waffle House) were just pancake batter in waffle shape.

The server got them promptly, but another  10 minutes went by before I had to find that same server to order drinks.

After a bit more talk, he relented because his supervisor approved of it.\\n\\nThe supervisor walked us to our table and I let her know that I thought his response was rude. She let me know she would handle it. The guy ended up being our waiter and it was awkward because he never apologized.

Is that okay?' How silly -- so you noticed I got it, but waited till you set it in front of me to tell me I couldn't get the discount? I replied that I wish I had known that, to which he replied, \\"It was on the menu.'\\n\\nThe rest went normally, but I gotta say, I work in food service, and you should never try and justify yourself as to why the restaurant made a mistake.

We knew we wanted to check out some Oriental stores in the area before our drive back home. I was so excited to find this place online. My husband and I were debating if we should go here or the 1st Oriental since they were on the opposite direction. We decided to check this place out since I've read good review about the store online.\\n\\nFirst of the store was nice and clean so I give them that.  The place was well organized and does not smell like some Oriental store. But that's were my good review ends. When we visited the place, there were two older ladies working there at the time. They were not friendly at all. I was looking for a vegetable that is not sold here in GA. I found one bag of it. I asked if they had anymore and the lady said she will go to the back and get more. So I wait, and wait for what seemed like eternity.. ok so like 10 mins and the lady comes out with ONE bag. I ask her if she had anymore and she said she will put one together again. I said ok so I waited again but told myself that if she took forever again to pack another one, I will just leave. Well it took her about the same time to come back out.  I'm assuming they were bad and perhaps she was picking the bad parts off of them otherwise I dont think it took 10 mins to bag some vegetables. Anyways, I ended up buying 4 bags of it, which by the time we got home were all mushed and threw them away. \\n\\nWhile I was waiting for the vegetables the older lady (cashier) found some vegetables and some other grocery items that was left at the end of the aisles by another customer and she comes up to me with a slight attitude asking if there were mine (assuming they were mine).

Upon our arrival we were greeted by a smile and told that the wait would be around 15 minutes.  So we decided to wait it out at the bar.  The first thing that we noticed was that all of the seating was outdoors, and semi covered.  This was no problem for us as it was a warm, balmy July evening.  I could see how some people might be turned off by eating outside so just a little warning.  Also, this is a dog friendly establishment. My step dad was shocked to see pooches casually dining with their owners,  but I was quick to remind him how much austinites love their dogs.  Waiting at the bar also gave us time to take the atmosphere of the place in. It has a very backyard,  homey vibe to it. Not at all pretentious,  one could get away with blue jeans and a t shirt here.  Once we were notified that our table was ready (by a Text message no less) we were escorted to our table. One more warning for the Contigo uninitiated; the tables are bench style. We had another party dining to our immediate left. Which was okay with us, but again might not be cool with some other people.  Once we were seated our server came promptly to take our drink orders and tell us about the specials  . Having already perused the menu while we waited we were all ready to order. I ordered the rabbit and dumplings,  my step dad ordered the hamburger and fries, and my mother ordered the fried chicken thigh. We shared an order of the crispy green beans as an appetizer.  Our food arrived quickly and looked great. The plating was simple and straight to the point. I grabbed my fork and dove head first into my rabbit and dumplings. I immediately feel in love. Even though it was mid July I was immediately transported to an autumn evening.  This was a very hearty dish and I loved every bit of it.  The vegetables were cooked to perfection and still had that snap when you bit into them, and the rabbit was so tender that it melted in your mouth.  The only complaint I had was for there to be more. I almost forgot my parents were there. While I can't go into detail in what that ate I will say that my step dad said that was the best burger that he has ever eaten. Coming from him that says alot. As for the chicken thigh my mother ate she told me that it was very good but she wished there was more to it.  I believe most of the dishes at Contigo are meant to be shared and eaten as a course in a much larger meal.   If you go for the coursed option i believe you would have a much better appreciation for everything this place has to offer. One more add on; the crispy green beans are a revelation and should be ordered upon every visit.

I've admittedly come here dozens of times - I doubt my med school apps would have gotten written if this place hadn't opened as I was writing them. The vibe is extremely peaceful, with just the right level of ambient noise from people catching up over a cup of tea, but enough focused energy from the rest of us hard at work. If you come early enough, seating isn't an issue - it gets extremely busy around or soon after noon though. My happy place is typing away while sitting on one of their tatami mat areas with a pot of green tea (the Kyusu set for two, which is refillable and comes with cookies!).\\n\\nThey really do try with their tea. Despite the rush of people, the water used to steep the tea is kept at the optimal temperatures (which is a bit below boiling), resulting in a deeper flavor. If you do get the teapot, be sure to pull the leaves out once your steep is done! This gives you more tea down the road, and prevents bitter over-steeping. Overall, their tea is better than average, but I don't think it's a can't-miss.\\n\\nThe matcha is OK, as well. Not particularly stand-out considering the recent wave of all things matcha, but much better than you would get at a chain coffee shop. The pastries (esp the matcha pastries), though, are worth a try. The kitchen is always testing out new recipes, and I've seen a lot of really interesting things come out. I think once I saw a gluten free matcha brownie with pie crust baked into it. Be warned, though, if you get the swiss roll, don't eat it by unrolling it from the outside - the center is all cream! Also, pay attention to the symbols next to the pastry names! They match the symbols on the tea so you know what pastry to pair with your drink.\\n\\nThe food has always been a bit expensive for me to try personally, and I've seen the portions are definitely Japanese-size. As for the service, the staff is generally friendly and extremely diverse. I wish they had a better way of getting your food to you, though.

I guess the point of coming here is just to say that we have been to Atlanta and had chicken and waffles (which is what Atlanta is supposedly famous for)! Mission accomplished.\\n\\nWe also tried the sweet potato cheesecake. It was light and pretty good. Not the kind of dense cheesecake that sits in your stomach for hours. I would order the sweet potato cheesecake again.\\n\\nI would give the food 3/5 stars as it was too greasy/ too much fried food for me.\\nService is 4.5/5 stars, pretty spot on.\\n\\nOne thing that I didn't like and wasn't sure if it was an unspoken practice in Atlanta was that they added a 18% gratuity to our bill. I thought gratuity usually applies to only parties larger or equal to six people. But apparently five people is enough to be charged for a gratuity. So you might want to double check if gratuity is in your bill already so you don't double tip or tip on top of your tip when signing your receipt.\\n\\nIf you are looking for familiar taste, food that will taste exactly as you expect, here is the place to be. If you are looking to indulge yourself with some fried chicken and waffles, here is the place to be.\\n\\nIf you are health-conscious and worry about your arteries being clogged with saturated fat, find the exit and dart."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"While their happy hour offers some great deals, Ive often felt rushed each time Ive dined for such an event.

Many hungover mornings i found myself here, so many in fact a friend of mine actually gave me a t-shirt for Christmas that says \\"some drink you like\\" which is what the waiter would ask us every time we sat down at our table. Now these by no means are the best cooks in the world , I believe that they make their western cuisine if you can call it that , better than their Chinese cuisine, which kinda sucks because they are Chinese (it didn't take long for me to leave that side of the menu alone and stick with the breakfasts). So it usually went order food, drink a gallon of water in ten minutes food arrives, slowly eat fighting back last nights festivities pay the bill and go. Service is good the guy that is there more often than not is more cheery than a Chihuahua on speed and takes his job more serious than a cattle herder in India.

I had never been to a churrascaria rodizio restaurant, where meat is served from table to table. According to their website, \\"once in your table, a seemingly endless stream of waiters will circulate with skewers full of meat, fresh from the grill\\". Sounds good right?\\n\\nWe started eating at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night. Their is a side buffet with a so so looking salad bar, so so fresh french fries, lots of rice, tasteless meatballs and poor chicken parmesan. It took the endless stream of waiters 10 minutes to come to our table. There was only 1 waiter going around the tables. He first offered chicken wrapped in bacon. Good but not what I was expecting of a MEAT place. It took forever to get more meat, at one point someone in the table said that there favorite was the cabbage she had at the salad bar (that was a hard comment in a meat restaurant).\\n\\nFinally we started to get different meats, still at a very slow pace. The lamb was fresh and tender, the steak was good, the 2 kinds of sausage I eat were one OK (it tasted like a Spanish chorizo) and the other one very fatty, I passed on the chicken hearts, the pork could have been more juicy and we were offered garlic bread after 90 minutes in the table. Half way through the dinner the waitress asked us if we needed anything else. I wanted more lamb but they didn't bring it only the check was already in the table (!!!!!!).\\n\\nAlso note I had a Restaurant.com coupon. It said that it was 25$ for 6$. Reading the fine print, it said a minimum of 50$ had to be spent, so it turned out to be 50$ for 31$ right? Not such a wonderful offer.\\n\\nIn general, not the best meat I have had, horrible timing bringing the meats out, understaffed and poor selection."},{"name":"H√§agen-Dazs","address":"1148 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I had what might be the most delicious lunch ever at Lindsay's.

It is hard to find  a great one though; Salty Sow is just on the cusp of getting there I wanted to give this place 5 stars, I really did. But in order to do that, you have to have the complete package and sadly Salty Sow fell short to a 4.5.\\n\\nIt's easy to see the sign right off manor and there's more than enough parking so you won't have to park in a neighborhood. The restaurant consists of two houses connected together with seating in both houses. You can also sit in the covered section between the houses or the patio in the back. The servers are really great since they are very friendly and helpful and can help you pick out the perfect dish for you or tell you the new items on the menu.\\n\\nThis is what we call the compliment sandwich; I say what's good, then I say what's bad, then follow with something that's good. If you just want to read the good stuff, skip this part because the bad isn't really bad. Drinks. My friend and I had 3 drinks among us, and we didn't like any of them until the ice melted to water it down and we could stir it like crazy. The drinks weren't shaken or stirred enough when we got them that the flavors were so separate on all three that it seemed like it may be an ongoing issue. I was disappointed but maybe I got the wrong drinks.\\n\\nThe food is great! And that's the whole reason you come here. Out of the 5 dishes split between 2 people (yes we're fatties but it also includes dessert and 2 apps/sides!), I was only turned off by one only because it didn't match the other dishes. The bone marrow is magnificent, i just wish there was more for $13. The brussel sprouts are great, reminded me of uchi/ko's and so so tasty. The pork belly was so good that I wish we got two of those instead of an order of beef cheeks which were just okay with some just okay polenta. And last, the butterscotch boudine. OMG delicious, make sure you get a little bit of everything and not just scoop from the top. The salt on the top provides the perfect balance to the creme fraiche and butterscotch. A definite must have if you can muster it all the way to dessert.\\n\\nSalty Sow is still new and will grow into it's own when perfecting certain items while being adventurous with other.

The ambiance of the place is lively yet quiet enough to have intimate conversations. For appetizer we ordered the Pimento Cheese Wontons and they were so tasty! It was the right amount of creamy; just enough to not make you feel nauseous. I told myself I would eat just one but ended up eating three. \\n\\nFor an entree I got the beef brisket plate. I loved that they had an option between the more fatty part or the lean part of the cow. I got the lean part but I couldn't even tell the difference. For sides, my roommate and I shared the Mac & Cheese, Green Beans, Corn Salad, and the Stew. They were all SO GOOD. None of the sides were disappointing and each one was made with such detail in the ingredients. \\n\\nThe only downside, in my opinion, was the sauce. It just wasn't as rich as everything else we ordered. \\n\\nNonetheless, the spicy BBQ sauce (which you have to order separately) was still good. I would definitely eat here again!

They tell us they are out of that crust, so we choose another gourmet crust.  They are out of that one also, so we ask which gourmet crusts do you have?  They have none of them.  We settle for a regular crust, since that's all they have.  We order two soft drinks, receive two cups, and pay for our meal.  As we go to fill our cups up with ice, the ice machine is broken.  Back to the counter where I tell them \\"your ice machine is broken.\\"  Oh yeah, they say, it is.  I tell them I don't want a warm soft drink, as it's 95 degrees outside.  I receive no apology, no offer to substitute for another drink, nor an offer to refund my money for a drink that's HOT.  Ok, moving on.  I order a pizza rustica with a gluten free crust, and substitute mushrooms for artichoke hearts.  Our other pizza was a pizza bianca with chicken instead of sausage.  When our lukewarm pizzascome out, yep, you guessed it - mushrooms ALL over, and sausage instead of chicken.  Great.  I bring it back to the counter, and they offer to remove the mushrooms.  Fine.

This casino needs months to figure out what they are doing.  I've been there twice in the past 2 weeks and both times it left a horrible taste in my mouth.

What amazes me is the Cleveland one was great and I've heard Toledo is good too!\\n\\nOpening night.  I played roulette and blackjack.  First, the table min was $15 for roulette, which I thought was ok, especially for opening day.  The first thing I noticed was the dealer had no idea what he/she was doing.  There were 3 occasions where I had won, but the dealer removed my money from the table and didn't pay me.  Each of those times I had to call the pit boss over and get paid.  There were 2 times where the dealer didn't pay out enough.   Again, had to call the pit boss over.  This was happening to people other than myself, so I wasn't special.  I walked over to blackjack to give it a try. $20 min.  Ok, a little richer than I like, but what the heck.  First thing I noticed was this dealer couldn't count to 21.  The person next to me had 17 and the dealer thought he had 28 and busted him, removing his cards.  A long discussion later and he was able to get paid (dealer busted).  Ohh, and you are able to touch your cards in black jack from the start?  I've never been to a casino where that's allowed.  After losing $200 I decided to call it a day.  \\n\\nFast forward to last Saturday night.  I stopped in after a night out, just for a few minutes to meet a friend.  Roulette was my first stop. $25 min table.  A little more than I like!  I decided to place a $25 chip on 11 and $25 on black, but NO i wasn't allowed to play the black because the dealer wasn't able to keep track of multiple bets!  What the heck kind of place is this?  You don't want my money?  Walked over to craps and all I hear is people bitching because the dealers keep missing bets.  My friends had to wait 3 hours for a table at dinner because the bar wasn't first come first serve?  5 seats open at the bar and they weren't allowed to sit there for dinner.\\n\\nLong story short, this place is a joke.

Incredibly tender, juicy and flavorful - I had never used bread to soak up juices this aggressively. Order only if you are ready to engage in deep sacred meditation with the part of your brain that appreciates food. \\n\\n(2) Truffled deviled eggs: It is rare to find a dish that makes such a pleasant use of truffle. It was very flavorful without becoming overwhelming, and I was left wishing I could blend the plate and drink it, to make sure no leftover flavors were left untasted. \\n\\n(3) Oyster Boudin Fritters: Eh, they were really good but did not bring me to tears like the rest of the meal. Would recommend trying other appetizers to see how those go. \\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\n(1) Pork Belly with Roasted Red Pepper Grits, Herb Sauce, Rainbow Chard, (allegedly) tears from angels: My girlfriend described this dish as transcendent moments before evaporating into a fine mist of pure bliss and joy. It took me far too long to realize my girlfriend was aerosol, as I was busy understanding my place in relation to pork in the universe. 10/10 would lose a significant other to the great beyond again.\\n\\n(2) Mushroom and Pork Lardon on Toast: Actually a great complement to the pork belly, exquisitely soft texture, strong and rich mushroom taste. I would almost get it as an appetizer, we definitely had a fantastic time splitting it.\\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\n(1) Beer: Continues to be a tasty and affordable beverage.\\n\\n(2) Salty Sow'r: Refreshing and went really well with our entrees.

We were definitely pleased though it is fair to say by this point in the meal we were merely intelligent shades of the color blue, and our appreciation for the flavor might not be transferable to the mortal plane. \\n\\nDesserts:\\n\\n(1) Butterscotch Boudin: My girlfriend and I are not particularly large people. You've seen the menu so far - you should be surprised a dessert would even fit into the equation, but we trusted the restaurant at this point. We convinced our stomachs that we had enough space for dessert and were pleasantly surprised with the soft creamy mana made remarkable by the occasional sea-salt crystal. As someone who hates desserts (not great at eating sweets) this was a fantastic dessert.\\n\\n(2) A single, delicate, shy but well-mannered, Rum Ball: Our waiter Dave, who should definitely get a raise, a harem, and a golden chariot to aide his daily journey across our skies, capped our meal with a courtesy Rum Ball. It was rich and sweet and Gatsby would've fallen in love with it for years. \\n\\nI have a small hole in my tongue that no longer responds to taste as it has not gotten over the emotional experience that the Salty Sow was. Take your loved ones there - take your boss there - take yourself there. Buy a house near it and grow a small family full of love and weekends at the Salty Sow. Have Dave deliver your children and name them. Install solar panels in your home. Leave no carbon footprint. Stop and smell the roses. Write a novel about your childhood.

The girl I was babysitting enjoyed playing around on them as I ordered my cup of coffee which was a plus.\\n\\nI ordered the Hazelnut Horsepower mocha thinking it would be simply AMAZING since I love sweet coffee drinks. When I got it, the owner asked me to try it first before leaving, so I did. I wasn't impressed at the coffee because it didn't have much of that coffee espresso taste to it and instead it was a hazelnut overload to my taste buds. I told the owner what was wrong, and he happily took the drink back and added an extra shot of espresso in it. I tasted it once more after the shot was mixed in, and I got a reasonable level of the coffee taste I oh so desired. Usually when I order coffee, 2 shots of espresso is enough for the coffee taste and caffeine levels I want. I was somewhat satisfied with the modified drink since the hazelnut sugariness was lowered due to the extra shot, so I took the drink and paid since I needed to go pick up the other girl I babysit from school. \\n\\nAs I was drinking the coffee, I noticed the texture was a lot different from what I am use to. This coffee was smooth in a strange way that kind of set me off from the drink, and I didn't even notice that there was any white chocolate mocha in the drink. Being a prior barista at 3 different coffee companies as well as an avid coffee drinker, I know what to expect from most coffee beverages. Sure, having both chocolate and a flavored syrup will make the drink sweeter, but not diabetes causing sweetness. There definitely needs some improvement on that recipe to have the correct sweetness and coffee balance to make that drink a lot better than what it is. Also, if you are putting two distinct flavors in the drink such as White Chocolate Mocha and Hazelnut, I am sure most people want to taste the White Chocolate more than the hazelnut (I know I did).\\n\\nI wish I could give this place  more than 2 stars because of the customer service I received was great, but unfortunately, I can't because I was let down by the coffee."},{"name":"Midwest Grill Brazilian BBQ","address":"1124 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I think most common problem I have with Brazilian buffet(i.e. Cafe Belo) is that food is often flavored way too salty.

One of these friends lives out this way (in Oviedo) and suggested that we meet here since he came out to near where I live (in College Park) the last time we hung out. I'd never been here before, though I just made my first visit to the Lake Mary location only a few weeks earlier. I therefore was familiar with the premise of The Tilted Kilt, but was perhaps a little unprepared for the excitement at this location. (Since it's only minutes from UCF, perhaps I should have known better.)\\n\\nMy friends and I were served by a group of servers (perhaps one was training the others?), all of whom were friendly and outgoing. They sat and talked with us for a few minutes, both when they were taking our orders and not, and came back as a group to serve our food and drinks. It was pretty funny. The servers, all young ladies dressed very provocatively, sat and chatted with other patrons, so our table wasn't special, really ... though they did make us feel that way. Personally, I could give or take stuff like this - I've been to Hooters/Wing House/etc. and have had fun, but haven't felt swayed to continuously return to such places based on their atmospheres/employees' clothing - but I don't have a problem with it, either.\\n\\nThe beers we were drinking were served, as was the case at the Lake Mary location, in glasses taller/wider than traditional pint glasses, though they do look very much like them. These are rather expensive, too - I think $4.25 or so, not including tax. So ... if you go here and have not yet been, be prepared to spend a little bit more money than you normally would, even if you avoid liquor and stick to beer.\\n\\nThe food here seems to be pretty good. I had a hamburger (I think something called a California Burger, which had guacamole and more on it) and enjoyed it. The bun was a lot softer and more chewy than are the buns at most other places that serve burgers. I wasn't expecting that, though I did not prefer or dislike it.\\n\\nAs our party was watching the baseball game, some young guys and girls were playing beer pong on a few tables set up not too far from where we were sitting. I found this to be kind of lame. I suppose that beer pong is a draw here since this part of town, thanks to the large # of UCF students, is very populated with people in their young-20s ... but I couldn't help but wonder why the people playing this weren't playing in their apartment on campus or just off it, and where they could get blind drunk and with more of the opposite sex (the males playing the game vastly outnumbered the females) in attendance. I love beer pong, but I don't know if it has any place in a setting where people are trying to eat and watch a game. I had to grab a pong ball off the floor for these people at least 5 times. It was an inconvenience, and the people playing weren't the nicest I've met. If the police aren't scoping this place out to catch people driving after excessively drinking, perhaps they should be.\\n\\nThis is a decent place and, for the most part, I had fun during my visit, but I just don't make it over to this part of town enough to see myself stopping in more than another few times for the rest of my life. It's not a priority for me. To me, the Lake Mary location is a lot nicer and a lot less like the Delta House from Animal House. I gladly will return to that one, but this location by UCF, in my opinion, leaves a lot to be desired. I suppose that the management realizes that they're not exactly catering to older adults and families at this store, but that doesn't mean that it should be a madhouse, either. There's a lot going on in this place and, to me, there are too many distractions and annoyances/inconveniences that would prevent me from simply sitting with friends and talking and enjoying a game."},{"name":"Dirty Martin's Place","address":"2808 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Dirty Martin's is one of those places that can and should be called a institution.

You can either order from a lineup of pre-cooked/warmed up food in the window, or order fresh from the menu hanging from the ceiling.

Additionally I ordered the Plantains, as a side dessert, and tried them here for the first time ever. \\n\\n     The place does not have the most clean seating area, and the organization of the tables relative to where people line up to order does not leave much room to sit, so I wouldn't recommend coming here to eat with a large group expecting to find very many empty tables (Mainly they have counters along the perimeter of the wall).  \\n \\n     I caught a glimpse of the kitchen and the cooks doing their thing, and to my surprise I actually saw some of them wearing gloves, which is kind of unheard of in the Boston food service industry.

The beans could have been better, and the rice seemed to be randomly blended with peas, and some other ambiguous elements which I could not catalog by taste or appearance.  \\nIn other words, I was not impressed.\\n\\n    The plantains on the other hand were very good, though I have nothing to compare them too.

I freely admit though that I don't eat a lot of meat so my comparisons are all based on the vegetarian options.\\nMy first of many burrito experiences started, as many do, at Anna's.  I was hooked.  But after awhile the surliness of the staff wore thin - at least let me answer about what I want before you start slopping things on there.  So I moved on to Boca Grande.  And it was good.  And then it wasn't quite as good, I wanted something...fresher.  And lo, there was Chipotle.  The guac, oh! the guac.  It's creamy and has just a slight tang of lime and they make it fresh all day so it's actually green, not a sad faded brown (looking at you, Boca G).  I've tried three locations, and the Harvard Sq. one has the best burrito rollers, hands down.  Dedham is hit or miss, and Brighton/Cleveland Circle are second-tier at best  The tasty ingredients make up for a lot though.  I like the hot salsa, although if you're used to a lot of heat (I am) it's not really that hot, but it has a great flavor.  I think their pinto beans have some meat in them so I go for the black beans, and I ask them to go light on the rice because sometimes they mound it on there."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went to Contigo this weekend with friends and it was delicious!

This place is almost never full so you can get in and get out faster than other restaurants as long as service is on its game.  I have noticed that they are very strict with their coupon policy as they use to have a BOGO then in the middle of the year they switched it to only $7 off.

Adding a healthy selection of RAW veggies to the bowl along with the steamed veggies, PLUS a cheese option (am I in Heaven?) and on top of that, all the chicken is antibiotic and hormone-free, AND they use local veggies where possible.  The staff is friendly and helpful, too!  LOVE this place!  All for the the right price.  Just a note - my husband thought that the noodle option was way greasy.  Also, they should add a turkey option, for those of us who can't always eat chicken due to it being to heat causing in Chinese medicine.

We are huge doughnut people and hadn't come across many on our trip.  It was early but i noticed they had a grapefruit prosecco doughnut.  My regret was that i shared it.  It reminded me of the breadiness  of NYC's Doughnut Plant.  The glaze wasn't too sweet, it was fantastic. Also i love that it came with a timbit.  I had the rabbit and dumplings, that arrived piping hot in a skillet.  The rabbit was tender, the sauce was creamy, and the dumplings were soft.

Me!  We stopped for a bite to eat on the way to a friends house and I had some driving to do, so the suds will have to be on another review.  The beer and brewery are clearly the star at this establishment.\\n\\nThey have long tables and the decor shows a lot of attention to detail.  They bring your check in a stein instead of a folder and there are cute signs with sayings about beer everywhere.  The place looks like a German or Polish beer hall with long clean looking wooden tables and they have a spot for live music which they have on Fri, Saturday and Sunday.\\n\\nWe stopped here because another Yelper mentioned German or Polish influence in the food.  Our server told me that the owners are Russian which explains the cabbage and plenty of potato dishes.  The menu had potato pancakes, salmon crepes and sausages which caught my eye.  We went for the homemade sausages which came with potato wedges ($14).  I was skeptical the wedges but our server said they were hand cut and fried.  They were delicious sprinkled with paprika and dill and served with a small ramekin of ketchup.   They sell these as a standalone menu item for $5 which is a little high.  The two sausages were a generous portion if a little drier or less grease than a German or Polish version.  They were calling out for some dark mustard so I requested some and got American yellow mustard.  When I mentioned to the server that these would be better with a German mustard I was told they used to have that but just have the plain mustard now and that they are Russian not German.\\n\\nWhen we got there two couples were just finishing up at the bar.  So we were the only food ordering customer but it took the kitchen a half hour to deliver one plate of sausages and the potato wedges.  When I realized how long the sausage was taking I put in our dessert order of crepes or bellinis before we got our plate.  These came with a size of jam and some cream cheese but also took a long time.  Our server noticed that we had finished the sausages and were waiting and said they had to make the batter.  When they did arrive these were fantastic and so good.  At $5 these were a bargain and I would order it again.\\n\\nSo overall great decor and an interesting menu.  I took off a star because of the long wait for food when we were the only customers, the lack of mustard selection that matches the dish and lastly inconsistent menu item pricing.  Good thing the menu is photo copied.  This place looks like it will be very fun and I can't wait to try the beer."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"The food here is great!

I think that I could subsist on it alone for weeks.  I could swim in a big vat of  it.  I often think that if/when I move out of Austin, I'd have to take a job in their kitchen so that I could gank the recipe.\\n\\nLet me talk about the chicken enchiladas for a moment.  The corn tortillas are dipped in oil before rolling, what I understand to be the traditional way.  The chicken is most likely boiled, and as another reviewer already said, it's stripped from the entire chicken, so it's really succulent.  The aforementioned enchilada sauce drowns the savory logs.  But we're not done.  They put MORE chicken on top of the prepped enchiladas.  And then generous piles of what tastes like government/American cheese, but is wonderfully delicious.  Actually, the sauce probably goes on last - that makes more sense.  Rice and beans complete the plate.  Somehow the combo of chicken, sauce and cheese flavors make me think of sex on a plate.\\n\\nThe tacos are terrific, but not to be taken home, because the fried shells lose A LOT of goodness by the time you get home.  Best to have them fresh in the restaurant.  Also, I've tried their tilapia tacos and found them to be well-seasoned and tasty.\\n\\nI think the cheese is so yummy and in some way defines Amaya's, but I'd imagine a lot of foodies would probably be offended by it.  It's on virtually everything you order, and, like Austin, they're liberal with it!\\n\\nOh yeah, atmosphere is EH, and service is consistently good.

Also the service was one of the worst we had ever experienced. When we showed up we were seated quickly but waited 15 min to even be approached by are waiter or even have our water filled up . Then when they brought out our food they informed us that the rice was not ready or our order of keema naan (if you ask me me they should have just kept our entire order in the back warm instead of only bringing half the order out). So then we waited another 15 minutes to get our full order out and by then our main course was cold, but there is a twist. They actually only brought out the rice and informed us that the keema naan would be out shortly. Then after another 15 minutes we asked again about the keema naan and she said that she would go check on it, shortly after she came back and said that she replaced the order (no real sincerity or sorry). Then another 10 min went by and finally she came out with the order placed it on the table and walked away. Later when we finished our meal another waitress came over and got the check for us.

I only tried a few appetizers, but I'll be back for dinner service! \\n\\nPros:\\n1. Very spacious - The windows open for fresh air. There's not a super amount of standing room near the bar but they have a variety of seats and tables to choose from. I never felt overcrowded.  In addition, they also have more space upstairs that I did not check out because I was comfortable with my seats at the bar\\n2. Service was stellar - We had a server who checked in on us for food and we never had trouble flagging down a bartender for a drink, even though the place was pretty busy because of the game \\n3. I've been on a chacuterie kick lately, and they served some type of cheddar cheese with horseradish that was ABSOLUTELY delicious. My group ordered a second board because that cheese and the brie were so addicting. Also, the bread comes out freshly toasted and still warm! \\n4. Plenty of variety for drinks. My guy friends appreciated the scotch options. I forget the name of the cocktail, but it was a lemon vodka with mint drink that everyone in the group agreed: VERY REFRESHING! \\n\\nCons:\\n1.

They're so creamy, tangy, and just the right texture. My only complaint is not all of the chicken was white meat. \\n\\n-My parents had Tacos. My Mother had the Fish Tacos, which she loved, and my Father had the Carne Asada, which he enjoyed but felt they had a lot of heat to them. Not in a bad way, but still, worth noting. \\n\\n-We had the Churros for dessert. I didn't expect them to be doughy and raw in the middle, but they were good regardless (my waitress said they make them doughy like that). \\n\\nOur only request is a guac for one- my Mom wanted it, but we did not. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo the service. My waitress (on 6/10/12 for lunch- dirty blond hair, average height, average to stocky build) had no personality, and no knowledge of the menu. \\n\\nShe comes up and the first thing she mentions is a special drink that benefits cancer. When we asked what the flavor was, and what alcohol was in it, she said she didn't know. ...Are you serious? It then took her 15 minutes to come back with an answer. You would have thought we asked for her first-born. \\n\\nShe had an attitude. She was pretentious about us not being able to pronounce some of the spanish names on the menu, she rolled her eyes when my Father asked for beans on the side (not in the tacos). She was slow to refill our drinks. \\n\\nI think this place needs new management to whip this place into shape. The food is great, although be warned its a different region of Mexico than most Mexican places, the service just needs work."},{"name":"42nd Ave Fish & Chips","address":"5302 NE 42nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Well...just jumped off the plane in Portland and trusted my exorbitant appetite to Yelp to this place.

I had the teriyaki chicken with egg roll...  the chicken was cooked well and fairly tasty, but the egg roll was a dripping, greasy mess.  Making matters worse was that the egg roll was soaked in some semi-sweet glaze that was totally out of sync with the filling.  I agree with Jaine P. that the rice was just too sticky and mushy...  and the cabbage was almost flavorless.\\n\\nIf this place was cheap I wouldn't object nearly as strongly, but my LUNCH entree was $7.50 without a drink.

Forget the ginger and scallion-- for something zesty, try the Hong Kong Bei Fung Tong style, for sure! It was so delicious, that my boyfriend, who is allergic to shellfish, made himself eat 1/3 of the plate. Overall the lobsters were cooked wonderfully, but the deeper sections of the meat were slightly fishy. \\n\\nThe General Tsao's chicken was... a little chewy.

I've lived in the city for 8years and wish I found this place earlier! I've been to a lot of restaurants in Boston and in the North End, and this place ranks up there with the best of them. \\n\\nFirsts, the Atmosphere was very inviting my friend described it as \\"Cozy\\".  The restaurant is tucked away on a quiet street away from all the hustle and bustle of Hanover Street. It's located inside an old house that they converted into a restaurant, which really makes it feel like your eating at an Italian family's house, rather than a restaurant in a major city.\\n\\nSecond, The service was great. The waiter was friendly and attentive, which says a lot since I went during Dine Out Boston, where restaurants are overly crowded and staff can easily become irritated. \\n\\nThird, the food was delicious. It wasn't the best food I've ever had in the North End but it I was still delicious and I didn't have any complaints.  I ordered some chicken pasta dish, the chicken was juicy and not over cook, the pasta tasted like it was hand made and not something out of a box.  On the recommendation of our waiter my friend ordered some type of fish (monk fish) that we had both never heard of, and she loved it.  I also had a few bits of hers and it was very good.  Like I said the food is very good, it won't blow your taste buds away like some other restaurants but you will be satisfied. \\n\\nOverall this place was awesome, and I might have to say it's one of my new favorite restaurants.

The wings were also good - though more gourmet than buffalo. So, while the flavor may not be as compelling as one would expect, the quality is excellent and the value is good.\\n\\nOne thing I noticed was that the patrons were lacking for a Friday evening - at least downstairs.

What?  They can't make more?\\n\\nTwo of us opted to share the STEAK TIPS & EGGS* $15 grilled tortillas, chipotle salsa, avocado, sour cream and their BREAKFAST PIZZA $15 2 eggs, sausage, cheddar, potatoes.  It being a breakfast pizza, I was surprised to find it topped with a scattering of french fries.  Why fries?

It was about 1 in the afternoon on a Sunday and there was only one occupied table. We weren't super-hungry but as they don't sell slices, we ordered a large pie with italian sausage and portabella mushrooms. Leftovers are never a bad thing.\\n\\nFirst tip: weigh your beverage options carefully. The soda fountain carries RC cola and IBC root beer, but the mix seemed to be off today. You may be better off with the homemade lemonade or a bottled beverage. Of course, given that you'll be waiting about 15 minutes for your pizza you may want something you can refill yourself if the place is busy.\\n\\nSecond tip: upon receiving your pizza, give it about three minutes to set. Otherwise you may fall victim to the dreaded ingredient slide. There's nothing like the sight of a naked slice -- some wrinkly crust and a bit of sauce -- while your cheese and toppings rest helplessly on the cardboard round.\\n\\nThird tip: grab some silverware -- it's sitting out in trays next to the soda fountain. Though the pizza is pretty damn good, it's not exactly of the variety where you can grab a hot slice and bite down with the reasonable expectation that everything will stay in place. (See tip #2 above.) The first couple of bites may need to be consumed with knife and fork.\\n\\nAll that said, Southside Flying Pizza does make an excellent pie. The crust is light and crunchy underneath with a good amount of gluten chewiness in the right places. It's not quite NYC style -- maybe a little too crispy for that -- but for flavor it tops Saccone's or Rounders. (For my money, Slices and Ices is still the Austin pizza to beat, with Home Slice coming in second.) The sauce was flavorful, though the italian sausage probably imparted a good bit of the tastiness in our experience. The cheese was very good, even if it didn't want to stay in place. \\n\\nI wouldn't use the word \\"tepid\\" to describe the place or the pizza -- and I don't think $1.75 per topping is out of line (Home Slice charges the same, and even more on their larger pizza). I didn't detect the saltiness described by some others. If the apparent popular preference for Home Slice means that I can get pizza this good without a hassle at peak times, I'm happy to let the people keep their illusions.\\n\\nFor photos of Southside Flying Pizza and the pie we were served, visit http://tinyurl.com/3ckxhk"},{"name":"Floataway Cafe","address":"1123 Zonolite Rd NE, Ste 15","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Unusual setting in a warehouse location but charming nonetheless.

Eventually I ordered the seared tuna appetizer and it was outstanding -- with lightly-cooked green beans, bits of black olive, and an interesting take on deviled eggs -- great late-night food (& an interesting mediterranean spin on a dish that could easily have been done more conventionally with sesame, sushi ginger, wasabi etc.).  It took great self-restraint to keep myself from ordering a rack of lamb afterwards.  The seared tuna was a dish where you could pick out every ingredient perfectly -- all fresh, balanced & complex, and beautifully-presented.

The place is on Pearl street, right next to may favorite bookstore in colorado.  After walking around a bit on Pearl, my wife and I decided we were hungry and decided to see if we could get in a bit earlier than our reservation.  The place was empty so we were in luck.  We asked to sit outside, for one because it was a beautiful day outside, and two, because the place was a bit stuffy and the decor choking.  So, we got our seats outside, and got some water and bread to start our dinner service.  We were overwhelmed with the welcome we got from our \\"water girl\\", our waiter and this nice older lady that checked on us a few times right in the beginning.  We thought oh this is nice, great service.  We started off with some appetizers.  Asked the waiter what he fancied the most on the menu and he said the filet tartare and the escargot, so that is what we decided on.  The filet tartare was nice.  Being from Wisconsin our family holidays always included raw beef and onion.  This tartare reminded me of a classed up version of this family favorite.  Good starter.  Next we had the escargot.  it was served with some whipped potatoes.  The escargot came to us out of the shell in a bowl in a sauce and sitting together with the potatoes.  I enjoyed the garlic flavors that encompassed the escargot and the potato whip was delicate.  This is truly a great start to the dinner, and unfortunately, truly where the service and quality stopped, (aside from the girl that filled our water, she remained great), my wife is on a duck kick, so for the main she went with the duck and duck, I went with the scallops, as I have been enjoying a good cooked scallop lately.  The waiter told us that the duck would be served medium rare, however when the food showed up it was medium well at best.  Therefore DRY DRY DRY.  The dish on a whole didnt make much sense.  There was a cranberry raisin hash of some sort that had a decent flavor profile, but it didnt make sense on the dish.  There were also a few carrots on the plate.  Nothing to really tie them in with the plate either,  seemingly just there as an afterthought. Thank goodness the water girl was so good, because my wife needed all the water she could get to help that dry mismatch to go down.  I had the scallops, which as I said, have been great lately in my fancy list, when done right.  The waiter described them as three large moist melt in your mouth scallops with a sauce that is zesty and to die for.  What I got was 2.25 scallops that were overcooked, which kills any chance of tasting good, mixed with a sauce that was just ill prepared and not cohesive with the rest of the dish.  When I say 2.25 scallops, I mean it literally.  I had 2 decent sized scallops and then my \\"3rd\\" scallop was the same size in circumference, however was literally about a quarter the thickness of the other 2 on the plate. It said to me, oops we dropped it on the floor and picked it up, cut off the part that got all dirty, and put it on the plate.  I was so disappointed with that one piece of pseudoscallop that the plate would have had to be perfect for me to forgive them that one. Unfortunately it was far from great.  The scallops tasted uncleaned and way overcooked, and as for the zesty sauce, nope!  It was as if they just went in the pantry, thought zesty, lets do a citrus fruit and mix it with some random, perhaps glue-like ingredients.  Yuck.  The only saving grace on that disaster of a plate was the cous cous, which I found to be quite tasty and well cooked.  So of the 100 bucks we spent, which for good food, I have no problem spending, the appetizers were the only part of the meal worth paying for, the rest was quite horrid.  Also as I mentioned the service was amazing to start off with, but at the end, we would have loved to have a dessert and finish our meal off on a possible happy note.  This however was not meant to be, as it took us about 45 minutes after getting our main dish to have anyone check on us again.  I had to get up, walk into the restaurant and hunt down our waiter, just so we could get our bill.  I would not come back to this restaurant, save maybe for a complimentary make up meal, only for the hopes that they just had a bad day.  I see other yelpers raving about this place, so it makes me think that maybe the meal and service we had was off, but I could not justify coming back to this place, dropping a hundred bucks, on bad service and worse food.  The appetizers and service started so strong, but man did it falter fast and hard.

It was our first time. We were all hungry and excited to order a large, 5 lb. Mountain Pie, which we saw in their menu and photos online. After going, I feel defrauded by the experience, and I sincerely hope that others read this review and avoid Beau Jo's. \\n\\nOnce we were seated and ordering, we perused the various types of mountain pies, and the 4 of us were in agreement on trying the 5 lb. \\"New Era\\" Mountain Pie. Prior to ordering, however, we asked the waiter to confirm the size of the pizza, and whether he thought it would be enough for the four of us. The waiter, in turn, touted how the pizza was piled high with toppings, was thicker than the average pizza, and that it typically feeds 5 people. At this point, we felt comfortable ordering the pizza.\\n\\nWhat we got looked significantly different from what we expected. Their 5 lb. Mountain Pie looks more like a typical large 16\\" pizza - to call it a \\"pie,\\" in the deep dish sense of the word, would be a lie. It was perhaps 1 cm. thick. The crust on the edges of the pizza is thicker than average, but overall the pizza we got looked nothing like the photos.\\n\\nMy friends and I had a hard time believing that the pizza we got matched what we had ordered, so we spoke to the waiter and confirmed whether the right pie had been prepared. He said that this was the 5 lb. Mountain Pie we ordered. Still in disbelief, I asked him if he truly believed this pizza was the appropriate size (and weight) of what was described in the menu. He said that maybe the 5 lb. Mountain Pies aren't always 5 lbs, but that we received what we ordered. He then offered to have his manager speak with us, and we said that we did indeed want to speak with the manager.\\n\\nWhat happened next made our dining experience significantly worse and contributed to the sense that we were defrauded. We saw the waiter go to the kitchen, speak to the manager, at which point we noticed the manager did not come to our table. After at least 5 minutes, the waiter came back and asked us if we wanted the rest of our pizza boxed up, pretending like we had never wanted to speak to the manager. We were still extremely hungry - the only reason we had uneaten pizza at that time was because we wanted to discuss it with the manager. I reminded the waiter that we wanted to speak to the manager, and he said he would go get her.\\n\\nThis time, the manager walked over immediately. As I related our confusion about the size of the pizza relative to what was depicted in photos and described by the waiter, the attitude we received from her was one of disinterest bordering on annoyance. We got the sense that this was not the first time she had dealt with this issue, and we received canned responses. \\n\\nFirst, she confirmed that we received the right order, and that the pizza we got was an exact production of what a Mountain Pie is supposed to look like. We then asked her why the pizza looks like just a typical 16\\" pizza and why it is not nearly as thick or heavy as advertised. She said that if the pizza was any thicker, it might not cook all the way through - which contradicts the success of every deep dish pizza establishment on the planet. She also stated that the photos are \\"exaggerated\\" by taking the photos at low angles so that they look thicker. This confirmed for me that Beau Jo's purposefully defrauds its customers and that she had dealt with this issue before.\\n\\nWe tried one last time to reason with her, stating that the pizza we got was, at best, the thickness advertised of their \\"Prairie Pie\\" and that $42 for a typical 16\\" pizza seemed outrageous. Her response was that Beau Jo's uses high quality ingredients that justify the price point.\\n\\nLet me be clear: I've had pizzas from all over the world, including New York, Chicago, Italy, and my hometown of DC, including from very high-end pizzerias. I will admit that the flavor of Beau Jo's pizza was good, but it does not compare to those high-end pizzerias I've been to. Despite this, NONE of those high-end establishments charged REMOTELY CLOSE to the $41.99 charged by Beau Jo's for a comparable 16\\" pizza. My friends and I feel like we were defrauded and ripped off.\\n\\nAfter we ate the pizza, we were still hungry and literally drove to a Little Caesars and bought 2 large pizzas totaling $11. That experience ended up being orders of magnitude more satisfying than our visit to Beau Jo's, and it's safe to say we will never return.\\n\\nOne in our party ordered a coffee, which she said was quite good, so if you want a cup of joe, Beau Jo's is fine for that. But if you're hungry and want a large pizza, do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague."},{"name":"Tamo Bistro & Bar","address":"1 Seaport Ln","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Service is poor.

And I didn't know if the place would be run by Ethiopians or Eritreans (which would be acceptable though slightly different) or some hippie who spent a few months exercising a trust fund in that part of the world. If you live in Boulder, you know what I mean. \\n\\nOn sustenance from the motherland of us all: \\n\\nBeing the matriarch of the palace, there is a gorgeous older lady whose name I am sad not to have caught.

She chooses someone to feed this way by surprise in seemingly every party and, of course, it was me. See above. \\n\\nSome people may find this strange. Personally, I like being thrown for a loop even when I know what I am sorta doing. And yes, her hands are immaculate and so are yours, hopefully. Just in case, you will get a warm towel. \\n\\nBack to the food. For those who don't know, injera is a sponge-like sour-ish bread which soaks up up stew-like foods very well. Many traditional Ethiopian dishes are stew like, so this serves well. The vegetarian dishes are particularly good. There is one with collard greens that is divine. I am also partial to their spiced version of Yebeg Alecha (lamb.) The Yemeser Wot (red lentils) is done well, though a little on the bland side for me.  \\n\\nWhat I mostly like about Ethiopian dining, besides the honey wine,  is the community aspect of it and that is not lost at Ras Kassa's, despite the lack of one in Boulder.

The Waiter counted the money then chased us down because he wanted at %15-20 tip.. I told him straight up that the service was horrible. I even said it to the owner too.

Secondly it took the waiter 10 minutes to ask us for our drink order, and then once we had ordered our drinks, it took him another 15 minutes for our food order.\\nTo top it off, after the allies arrived and my wife had to get two peoples attention and later on by the third attempt got the owners attention for a glass of wine (which at least arrived promptly) we waited 55 minutes for our food! \\n\\n55 minutes for 4 dishes to come after an order of applies for the table... are you kidding me? We left there around 11:20 and our reservation was for 8:30. Not only did you insult us because we had a baby with us (the fuss they had caused because of her was shocking and appalling and lengthy to write) but your service was below 2 stars and the time to wait for our dinner was ridiculous. By the time our dinner came which was probably 9:45 the restaurant wasn't even busy. We were going to order dessert but why waste another minute or dollar here. Unfortunately we used to love this restaurant and everything about it which was why we ranted and raved and brought our friends here but it was a mere disappointment. The bill was $320 which is fine if it was an enjoyable time. The carpaccio was just ok- my T-bone steak was not good at all.

Yikes! \\n\\nOn 4/21 we arrive at Applebee's South Bay, and 2 minutes later we are \\"greeted\\" - or not so \\"greeted\\" - by a staff member who is really NOT that happy to do their job. Lol. I get that some times it might be a DRAG to do your job, but it is a job, and you are being paid....\\"Hi, what would you like to drink?\\" Lol, not even a \\"Hello, how are you guys today\\" with a smirk.....just a straight faced \\"Hi, what would you like?\\" .......Listen, me and the boo are NOT hard people to wait on. We figured maybe it was a bad day and gave the girl some slack....ordered our drinks and our food right on the spot..I got the salmon and Jonathan got the Cowboy burger, no veggies please...5 minutes later we get our drinks......10 minutes after that we get our food. Wrong order-burger came with veggies. He just picked off the veggies. We don't see the waitress until the end of our meal in which she says \\"you guys know how to use the electronic thing to pay right? Okay. Great. Have a nice day\\"......and walks off....I'm pretty sure me and the boo were not jerks to her, its just not who we are....But again, we just thought it might have been a bad day....So we thought....\\n\\nOn 4/22 we arrive at Applebee's South Bay, and it took us seconds to be seated. Great! We'll be in and out PER USUAL, because we are REGULAR CUSTOMERS.....You know? Our meals never take more than 30-45 minutes here because we are REALLY not difficult lol...We're given our menus and we figure out what we want...10 minutes go by and no waitress........another 5 minutes go by......The boyfriend says that after 5 more minutes if we get no one, we're going to walk out... We had to have seen 10 waitresses pass us lol. LEGIT...2 minutes later we get a waiter who asks us how long we've been waiting....We tell him, and he says that he'll let a waitress know and to give him a couple of minutes....another 5 minutes pass...I wish we would have left at the 15 minute mark. A waitress FINALLY comes after 20 minutes...She, also with an attitude, takes our order. Not even apologizes for the long wait. Not a \\"Hello, how are you?\\"..Again, another \\"What would you like?\\".....We put in our order.. I want the broccoli/shrimp cavatappi. Jonathan got the Cowboy burger, NO VEGGIES PLEASE! 15-20 minutes later we get our order. It has now been a 40 minute wait for food.....AND LOW AND BEHOLD. The Cowboy Burger comes out with Veggies AND SOMEONE'S EYELASHES ON THE SIDE OF THE PLATE...EW!.....So we wait another 5 minutes to see if the waitress will come over.....WE HAD TO GRAB ANOTHER WAITER TO HAVE HIM GET OUR WAITRESS, and he decided that he would click on the \\"Call button\\" on the electric pad....that's great and all, but we want the waitress, NOW....We look around to find that she's in the back talking and laughing to a group of other waiters/waitresses.....great system guys! We asked ANOTHER WAITER to get us the manager.....I guess he must of went and told our waitress, because she came over with an attitude and with her hands out, on the table, says \\"Is something wrong with the order?\\"....We tell her what's wrong with it (eyelashes and veggies), and with an attitude she goes \\"Well I asked them not to put veggies. So I don't know why that happened.\\" Personally, I don't care who told who what! At this point we've been sitting for nearly an HOUR waiting for service and food. So with an attitude she says that she'll take the food back and get it fixed. And I say \\"By the way I want to speak with your manager asap please\\".OH DID THE WHOLE ATTITUDE CHANGE...She was being SUPER attentive to our table. She even brought us \\"Free\\" drinks (a water and a Pepsi). Jonathan's burger comes back out 15 minutes later. My food is cold by then...To make a longer story short, we waited on the manager, Rony, for 45 minutes....we're now at a 2 hour dinner...Haha. We explain the situation to him, and he says \\"I apologize for the 45 minute wait for me, I was dealing with another table, I'm not sure why you guys waited so long for someone to help you, but it is out of my hands....\\" OKAY! What!? Not even a \\"This is how I plan to fix it?\\"  NO \\"Hey can I get you a free dessert to make up for it?\\" OR A \\"I'll give you 20 percent off your next order if you come back?\\" Lol...His excuse is \\"I was helping another table, and I couldn't help you. I apologize for the inconvenience.\\" HAHA!!!! NEVER COMING HERE AGAINNNNN. He nixes the burgers off the order - which is what I expected, but for a TWO HOUR WAIT\\n\\n...It's really sad because this was the FIRST PLACE me and by boyfriend started dating.....pretty sad that we'll NEVERRRR BE BACK HERE.....HONESTLY take the drive up to Rt. 1 Saugus Applebess!

Rolls are well done, a bit on the smaller side, but the sushi itself was large.\\n\\nThe staff is very helpful and attentive, we will definitely be back often."},{"name":"MOD Pizza","address":"701 S Capital Of Texas Hwy, Ste F-600","city":"West Lake Hills","stars":"4","text":"I'll give MOD credit that in response to my review, they sent me a gift card so I can try them again.

He was quick, efficient and friendly.  Nice ambiance for a moderately priced restaurant.\\n\\nHot and Sour Soup was yes, hot and sour - excellent.\\n\\nI ordered extra spicy Kung Pao Shrimp - The heat didn't disappoint me at all.  I wanted hot and I got it.  Beads of sweat on my brow and my lips were burning.  So, so good.  \\n\\nIt was almost all shrimp with a little peanut and lots of ground chilies.  Some zucchini and water chestnuts would have been a fantastic add here.
