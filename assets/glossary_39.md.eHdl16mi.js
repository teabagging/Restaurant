The menu was small and extremely predictable. I went with the fish and chips, figuring I couldn't go wrong, and I was sadly mistaken.

Thank you"},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We decided to attend the show for our son who is almost 4 years old. I'd give the show about a 6/10 rating. The performers were good. However, the act itself was a bit corny. At least from an adult point of view, though our son seemed to love it and had a good time.What you should expect before you go.\\nParking: $5.00 per vehicle.\\nTickets: $66 adults, $40 ages 3-12The food: Kids get Macaroni and Cheese with 2 chicken tenders. Adults pick was either Chicken breast or beef with rice and vegetables. They allow u to upgrade to Salmon for about $8.00 and Filet Mignon for $18.Picture: When you enter the place they take a picture with u and your family. During the end of the show, a staff member will display the photo in front of you asking if you would like to purchase it for $30.00. They print the pictures out; if you do not buy them they just trash them. If I were them, I rather get something than nothing. I bet if they charged $10, more people would buy them.Pro's: \\nI will start with saying the place is great for kids who are around 3-13. I would not recommend it for adults without kids. You will find it immature and boring. My almost 4 year old son loved it, so it was nice to see him smile and cheer for the pirates. The staff was friendly. The acrobatics/dancers were engaging with the crowd and kids.Con's: Issue 1: \\nFor $172 for 2 adults and 1 child, what quality do you expect? At least equivalent to a 3 star restaurant one should expect, that is fair, right? Dinner was equal to what is served inside a middle school cafeteria. The chicken was decent, rice was dry and the vegetables were bland. My sons Mac and Cheese was nasty. The noodles were overcooked and the cheese was appalling. The chicken tenders were a little bit better. Remember, for $172 the food could have been better. I forgot, the meal did start with a salad, which was iceberg lettuce, no mixed greens. After the entr√©e, people received ice cream and a chocolate brownie, which was ok, but nothing to brag about.Issue 2:\\nHow are you going to charge such crazy prices and then charge customers for parking? The parking attendant was hilarious; he said everyone gets mad at him, seeing no one is told in advance that they charge for parking, until they get there. The guy was super cool though.Issue 3: \\nPictures, this is more for management. I understand that some customers may like having a picture taken there. That is great and all, but $30? If customers could buy them at $10, they would still make a nice profit, seeing pictures are cheap to print (8x10 for under $1). As a business man, I rather make something, than nothing at all. Why not have 75% of your customers buy at $10, than only have 8% buy at $30? (just throwing numbers out there)Issue 4: \\nI don't want to be constantly finding faults, yet when you work in the industry u have certain things u expect. The waiter who took care of the guests in the roll right next to us, he was not serving VIP, it was of customers who had the same tickets as us. He visited the table often, refilled waters, brought over a hot push cart of food to make sure everyone had enough food, and he even brought his section their food items quickly. Our server, visited 4 times during the show and we had to wait about 15 minutes for a takeout box. The 4th visit was when she dropped off a tray which asked for $5 tip for each adult and $3 per child. I strongly believe in leaving a tip, usually at least 20%, but if the service is above and beyond 25-50%. The waiter next to us deserved 25%, but our server, I would say not. She was very nice and professional, just slow.Conclusion:\\nIf you have children 3-12 they may find the show enjoyable. Singles or couples without children will probably be bored as the show is designed for children. If you have children less than 30 months, they will probably be scared of the gun shots and flashing lights. The parking issue needs to be taken care of; charging $5 for parking is just terrible, there website does not state they charge for PARKING. For the price of the show, the food is of awful value. I'd guess their kitchen cost of the chicken dinner is $3.50 a plate, if that. Expect to tip $5 cash per person. Expect to spend extra money if you rather have Filet Mignon (18) or Salmon (8). I believe I have those numbers right, but I could be a little wrong. Expect to spend $30 if you want a picture wearing a pirate hat with your family.Before you go, look for discount tickets. They are available at hotels and resorts. Do not buy tickets on-line and pay full price."},{"name":"903 Mills Market","address":"903 S Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Grateful bread may be one of the best sandwiches around.

I loved the decor.  With 250 reviews and a high star count, I figured this was a Columbus staple.  It was a friend from Cincinnati that suggested it when we came up for CD101 Day @ Lifestyles.   I went into this place with zero expectations, but upon arrival they were asking people to stand outside because of the very limited waiting area.  I figured that this meant I was in for one hell of a treat.  We were there for 30-40 minutes before getting seated.  Good beer selection, not great, but definitely a place a beer snob could find a good beer while hipsters could have their PBRs and Schlitz (yes, the beer that made Milwaukee famous is in the house!).  So I don't know if there is hype around this place, as I don't live in Columbus and had only heard of it an hour prior to darkening it's door, but given the number of reviews, I'd say it's probable.  By no means at all am I saying it was bad, but the food was not necessarily hype-worthy.  They were nice Vienna Beef dogs, and all kinds of funky toppings, but it fell short of greatness.  Aaah, it's OK, we've got places in Cincinnati that are exactly the same (Zip's), with lines out the door, and a pretty average product, but you're never unhappy with the decision to eat there.

I kept saying I was going to try it out, so I finally made it today. When we arrived, I was happy with the parking lot behind the building because I hadn't seen any parking while driving by. There is plenty of parking spaces. The restaurant is located in the cute Avondale Estates village area. It looks like the area is being revitalized with other new shops and restaurants which are coming, so it is in a great area. As we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted by the hostess and seated near a really neat display of vintage toys behind a glass case to be admired. There are two of these, and I saw some toys that reminded me of my childhood. There are other really interesting pieces of art on the wall that goes along with the theme of the restaurant very well and kept my curious 4 year old entertained.We started with an appetizer of boiled peanuts. I ordered a small, but it was plenty for the two of us with some to take home. We both ordered corndogs, and they were absolutely delicious! All of the corndogs are made to order by choosing the meat and a batter that you choose to be freshly dipped before frying. They are very large I got the original batter and loved it. I might try one of the other kinds on our next visit. The mac and cheese was very cheesy and delicious.

Super cozy with a hipster vibe, cool graffiti/brick wall, and really nice bar with quite a collection of exotic bitters. Oh yeah and AWESOME food...we actually came here twice in one day! Our first stop was Sunday Brunch, I ordered the Salmon Benedict (subbed tator tots instead of home fries) and it was one of the best brunch dishes I've ever had. The salmon cake was heavy on the salmon and fried perfectly. Wilted garlic spinach, perfectly poached eggs, and dill hollandaise topped it off. The tots were perfect and crispy. I did have a screwdriver type of drink (can't remember the name) that included a fennel flavored liquor. Although I was apprehensive of the flavors, it was mixed perfectly, I really enjoyed it! Later that night, after having a couple drinks, we were looking for a late  dinner spot. Most of the restaurants had just stopped serving food but another place down the street advised us that Ward 28 has a late night menu, so off we went! We ended up having another (couple) beverages and ordered a dozen oysters and lobster rolls to share. The oysters were great, typical of what you find around Boston but the lobster rolls were something different. They came 2 mini rolls to an order and the lobster was mixed with truffle mayo. The bread was perfect, fresh herbs (chives? tarragon?) set off the whole roll to perfection. Not sure if it was the drunk munchies but we LOVED the lobster rolls. On top of this, the service was excellent BOTH times and the bartenders were super friendly and helpful.

There was a glob of the dill cream sauce next to the potato cakes, underneath one of the potato cakes, and underneath the salad mix. I think if there were two spoonfuls less of the dill sauce, the dish would have been essentially perfect.My friend asked for the burger in well, but he bit into it and the burger was cooked medium rare instead. He still ate his burger, but was a little sad it wasn't received the way he asked for it.My other friend who had the Salmon Eggs Benedict enjoyed it completely.Our server wasn't incredibly attentive to us. He came, grabbed our orders for food and drinks, and we didn't see him again until the end where he asked us if we were ready for our check.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"In the six months that I've lived in Atlanta, I've had enough barbecue to realize what is what in regards to the good, the bad, and the down right ugly.  I feel like my palate is fairly educated at this point.One of my co-workers has been hyping up this place to me since the day I moved here.  He's suggested several other places for us to try, and he's also mentioned in one of my previous reviews.  At this point, he can tell me to jump off a bridge and I'm there.  It took me too long to get to Fox Brothers.  Rest assured it won't be long before we visit again.We started our meal with some jalape√±o poppers and Texas Fries.  These are not your ordinary jalape√±o poppers and they certainly do not pop them into a fryer from a frozen bag.  They are cream cheese poppers with, from what I can tell, barbecue pork inside.  The Texas Fries were typical cheese fries with some fresh jalape√±o slices.  The twist?  You can put pulled pork or brisket on the first.  Big win with big flavor.The husband and I did our usual 4 item plate to share.  Let me preface this by saying that this was more than enough food for the 2 of us.  This was a questionable feat, but we were hungry.  We chose the sliced brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and wings with a side of tater tots, and their Fox-a-roni.  They have amazing barbecue sauce, but I didn't use it.  You can eat all of their meat dry.  It has so much smoke flavor and seasoning that I couldn't even think of dousing that wonderful flavor in sauce.  Especially since wasn't even close to being dry.  Even more surprising, I had the best wings iN MY LIFE there.  Smoked chicken wings.  Nothing more needs to be said.  Tater tots are tater tots, but the Fox-a-roni?  I imagined how much more wonderful it would taste if it was 15 degrees cooler.  Comfort food at it's best.  It's essentially their Brunswick Stew with cheese and macaroni.Not to mention we topped it off with their banana pudding.  I honestly don't have words for it.  I love banana pudding, so it's not hard to have me at a loss for words when it comes to that.In a nut shell, if you live in Atlanta and you eat meat, you have little to no excuse for not visiting Fox Brothers.  Actually, scratch that.  Even if you don't eat meat they have something for everyone, like a Pimento Cheese Sandwich or a Smoked Portobello Burger.  So this is your mandate, Atlanta."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm so full!

We ordered 6 plates for 2 people and were really stuffed, unfortunately leaving no room to try dessert.  When I go back I will cut out one plate and leave room for the finale.Enjoyed everything.\\n1.  Charred broccoli -- perhaps a touch too charred and a little too much sugar in the pureed squash, but a delicious combo with a little spice and a great start to the meal.\\n2.  Japanese eggplant -- not what I was suspecting, but very good.  Not greasy the way eggplant often is.  There was something too crunchy in the dish, but the flavor was excellent.\\n3.  Rabbit -- I don't normally enjoy things that are fried/breaded, but I was intrigued and like rabbit in general, so....  All of the flavors (with the apple and blue cheese) blended well together and the texture all worked.  \\n4.  Carbonara -- Although just a touch too salty, the bigoli (pasta) were cooked to an al dente perfection, with a delicious sauce and the egg on top being the piece de resistance.  \\n5.  Pork belly with grits -- Again, a terrific combo of things.  They switch this up seasonally, and though I like strawberries I like peaches even more, and that was the accompanying fruit on the night we ate.   Textures and flavors all well combined.\\n6.  Sweet corn gnocchi -- Gnocchi is a dish I always order with trepidation (having been raised on my nonna's exquisite homemade stuff), but happy I took the plunge here.  Perhaps again just a bit too much sugar, but wisely this was served to us last and so it was almost like a dessert.  Great texture (the downfall of so much gnocchi)Sometimes restaurants try too hard to do too much and er by adding one ingredient too many, but not the case here as each ingredient had its proper place in these dishes.The service was excellent, from the water guy to our primary server.  A lot of restaurants are doing this Euro-ice free water nonsense these days, but I am the ugly American who wants more ice than liquid, but they gladly indulged by needs and even brought my ice refills without my having to request them.We mentioned to our server that it was our lucky #13 anniversary but that we weren't drinking b/c we had over indulged at a wedding a couple of days before -- he brought us some delicious, complimentary mocktails which were such a lovely surprise!  It was a terrific accompaniment to a wonderful anniversary dinner.I am anxiously anticipating a return in about a month when they start serving fall foods.

Time passed before a different server asked if our drink order had been placed and asked what it was again, before getting it himself.\\n- We ordered queso as an appetizer. The chips in our basket were clearly the pieces left at the bottom of the bag as they were extremely small, not great for eating queso and salsa. \\n- My fianc√© ordered the 3 meats and 2 sides plate including brisket, sausage, ribs, macaroni and creamed spinach. All the meats were extremely greasy, and the macaroni was bland. The creamed spinach however, was very tasty.\\n- I got the cheddar jalape√±o sausage. Unfortunately it was extremely tough and chewy, and it seemed to not be heated all the way through as the large pieces of cheddar cheese inside were very solid. My potato salad was pretty ok, I think that is just a matter of taste...but the coleslaw was extremely runny! I'm talking half my cup filled with mayo water after I had eaten the solids. Overall, we left full, but dissatisfied. A disappointing experience for dining out. In truth, I think Austin has many other BBQ options that are way better."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I knew this right away when I walked in and the walls were not white plaster with a blue horizontal stripe at shoulder height.  Also, there are no dusty framed photos of Corfu from 1974 on any of the walls.In fact, Acropol is much nicer than this.  It looks new.  It looks like some care has gone into decoration and furniture.  There was Greek music playing but it was not too loud and conversation was easy.  The tables are close together but I didn't feel even for a minute like I was crowded in by other customers.  The staff were all very courteous.  We stayed around for at least 1 hour after paying the bill and we never felt pressure to leave (it helps that the place completely cleared out at 9pm, though.  And for some reason they're open till midnight).I had a lamb and prawn souvlaki plate, which was as delicious as it sounds.  The lamb is marinated in something interesting -- some kind of sweet red wine? -- that gave it a unique taste.  The prawns were garlicky and just salty enough.  My friend had the roast lamb (\\"Exohiko\\") which was equally delicious.  I really wanted to try the Pestrofa (trout stuffed with crab and shrimp) but they were unfortunately out of it tonight.The portions are large enough that we were both full, but not the heaping piles of rice and potatoes that you get at other Greek places (which is fine by me).The quality is better than the typical Greek restaurant.  The rice had a tomato-based sauce that was excellent, the greek salad had some kind of vinaigrette dressing, the tzatziki was light but flavourful.  And slightly higher prices match the higher quality: for two meals and a pita-and-tzatziki appetizer, we paid $48.50 (incl tax and tip)."},{"name":"Pazzo Ristorante & Bar","address":"269 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Yum and Yummer!What a pleasant surprise to the neighborhood.

Mind blown.If you're willing to shell out some money for some less-than-normal dishes, this might be your spot. Although this is a tapas-style restaurant, we left feeling pretty full.I love that they have a nice selection of wine. It's too bad that the wines-by-glass list was a lot shorter though. Since I wanted to order oysters, I opted to go with a white wine and was a little disappointed to hear they didn't have any buttery chardonnays that I normally like. Our waitress even said that was mostly a California type of wine, which tugged on my heartstrings a little bit. Time to move back home! (just kidding)We ordered the following for food:Oysters - $1 per oyster from 5:30 until they run out, Sundays - Thursdays only. I've had better oysters and these were a bit chewier than normal but at $1 a piece I can't complain.Rabbit meatballs - These were really delicious with a mix of textures and flavors. The rabbit was slightly gamey but not overly and was complemented well with the fruit flavors.Gnocchi - Maybe my favorite dish. The gnocchi tasted fresh, the sauce was good, and the peas added a nice crunch.Korean Short Ribs - I only had a bite since this was my friend's dish but the meat was flavorful, maybe just a tad too salty.They also gave us a complimentary dish. I don't remember exactly what was in it...definitely fish and egg but whatever it was, you mixed it all up in the bowl and spread it on a slice of toasted bread and it was very tasty.The service was excellent. I love it when waiters/tresses are on top of it with refilling water. And the overall ambiance was fun. We sat at the counter and got to watch the chefs work. It was pretty hilarious to just stare straight into the face of the roasted pig sitting on top of the oven."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was good.

Though I've spent some time in Expo Kitchen--the popped corn with dill pollen and parmesan is addictive--I've dined in the Club Room, the more formal back room, more often and will focus this review on that. The food: What I appreciate about Tapestry is that it is distinctive, flavorful food that offers just enough familiarity, too. Some of my favorites include the jicama salad with fluke ceviche and lime/buttermilk; it was my first time eating ceviche and the citrus and hint of heat were fantastic. I am converted, and can't wait to order it again. The same goes for the green curry with English green peas and escargot--I love curry but had never had escargot, and it was so bright and packed with flavor and tenderness that I've had it each time I've returned. The chicken with crispy skin and steak with chimichurri sauce were hearty meals with bold flavors, and my dining companions raved over the farfalle with green garlic, mushrooms, sorrel, and miso-goat butter. Desserts here are treasures, and like the savory items they offer totally unexpected ingredients and combinations with subtle hints of the more familiar. The sea buckthorn parfait with lemon verbena and white chocolate is exceptional; (I've now learned sea buckthorn are tiny berries and this dessert is a must-have.)The atmosphere: It's clear that a lot of thought and care went into the vision behind the Club Room d√©cor--the four-sided fireplace, jungle-inspired wallpaper, plush fabrics and bright colors of the club chairs, and the dim lighting create an intimate, exotic space. The playlist complements the smooth vibe, and the private room in the back with the mirrored doors is a great space for a party or gathering. The service: I've sat at both bars for drinks, I've dined in small groups, I've brought a small child, and I've had a multi-course 18-person event in the private room, and the service has consistently been knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. They know their menu, they know their pairings, and they know how to show you a great night. I should also add that multiple people in our parties have had food allergies and other dietary restrictions, and Tapestry has been more than accommodating in each instance. These are chefs who love to play with fresh, seasonal ingredients and change up their menu often, so I'm looking forward to stopping in again soon."},{"name":"The Oakwood Canadian Bistro","address":"2741 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Food--Excellent!  Went with a group of 4. We all got something different off of the brunch menu and all agreed the food was fantastic. The restaurant uses quality ingredients and it shows. For only $10 a plate for brunch menus (served until around 2), it's definitely a good value.  Nice decor. Modern but homey with wood everywhere you look. Service: This was the only negative. After being told it was a 10 minute wait by a girl who didn't take our names, we waited for about 30 minutes. Didn't get our food for about another 30 minutes. The manager did apologize. Our server wasn't a shining star, but got the job done. Seemed like a bored university girl who is just doing this to pay the tuition bills. Cute, but not very attentive or friendly. As it is, I'll likely go back sometime for the great food, but will not make this a regular habit due to the lacking service.

The big bang is pretty similar minus the chicharrones and only one type of pork belly. The flavor of both was good, but it was pretty hard to pick up the bao, as the sauce made the bao mushy and crumbly.

The show-stopping order without a doubt is the brisket. We were a party of 4 and got 1.5 lbs of brisket (both lean and fatty), 6 rib bones, 2 sausage links and 1/4 lb of pulled pork. All were amazing, but the brisket is what you will be thinking about long after you leave.As for the line: We arrived at 7:20a and were 10th in line. They have about 50 chairs that are for everyone, so that was a nice bonus to have. The thing to remember about the line is that when the doors open at 11a, it takes quite a long time for each party to order and be served since the guys at the counter hand cut each order to spec. So if you are like #50 in line, you are still going to have wait a good 45-60 minutes after the doors open. By 8:30a, the line was 50 people long and by 10:30a, they were telling folks who came that they could not promise them food -- these folks were about #150.So, my recommendation is to arrive before 7:45a. The wait itself went by in a flash. They have a really great coffee cart in the parking lot that opened at 8a, and many people had coolers of beer, blankets, books, kids running around etc. Just a cool vibe. And the Franklins' staff were super nice, constantly coming by to update everyone on the process and go over the menu. After two cups of coffee, some nice conversation and a long magazine article that I brought with me, it was 10:59a, and the doors swung open.

There is a way to go about things and being disrespectful, rude and condescending to new visitors to the city (my parents) was shocking and no apologies were made. It's obviously a popular bar in the summer with the increase of traffic in the west end and they can afford to turn away business. The Donnolly Group need to take a look at what is being done here as staff on the front door appear very junior and have terrible customer service skills. Management do not care about local repeat business and treating customers with contempt seems to be tolerated. That being said there are nice friendly servers working here and it has decent drink service.

Franklin really knows his stuff.  I was a little concerned when they moved from the trailer to the restaurant that the quality would go down, but it hasn't, it's still amazing.  Brisket, pork, ribs, all amazing.The line is absolutely killer, I waited a full hour to place my order.  If the line was shorter I'd probably go more often, it's more of a special treat place now because of that.  They could be more efficient if they wanted to, they only serve one person at a time and they don't \\"hustle\\" like some of BBQ places do.  I know that the slow, personalized service is part of it's charm so perhaps it wouldn't be possible to be more efficient and still this amazing.  In fact, I rather nothing change than risk it going downhill.  If you want faster BBQ there are plenty of options, if you want better BBQ there are no other options (unless you drive to Lockhart and even then I think Franklin is pretty competitive).All the 5 star reviews are accurate, this place is amazing and the line is insane.

A lesson, young grasshoppers: don't pour over Yelp reviews, like, ten minutes before trying someplace new, especially if you grew up in Newton and had high expectations for this, one of the few local restaurants of its kind.  The flaws will glare, resulting in the very manifestation of a quite accurate two-star rating: meh, I've experienced better.We went there on New Year's Eve.  Its dead-as-a-doornail interior laughed bitterly at my frantic reservation, and made the gaudy New Year's Eve crowns atop the sullen servers seem all the more desperate.  And you know what didn't help?  The bland chickpea dip on the table that can't seriously expect to be called hummus.Dinner wasn't terrible, but we did encounter the same problem as many a yelper below me in that they didn't have quite a few things that were on the menu (resulting in a Sophie's Choice style tug-of-war between myself and my friend's husband for the duck), and, regrettably, the proscutto/blue cheese/portabello appetizer was a blackened vision in balsamic vinegar.Our waitress was foreign, which is certainly not a problem, except that she had a feisty little 'tude on her that she thought was endearing.  Basically, I got mad teased while she paid a little too much attention to us, and simultaneously didn't refill our water glasses.  Then she took our coats, hid them, and then obliviously sent us on a little treasure hunt at the end of dinner while she chatted with her fellow bored colleagues.For our $50 each, it certainly wasn't horrible, but even as I write this review, my mouth is tsking away the acrid visceral memory of balsamic vinegar.

They have only officially been open for a week or two and are already drawing a good crowd.  When I went, it was steadily busy but not yet crowded - there was always a seat at the bar.It has a very inviting interior.  In the main room, patrons can sit around three sides of a large rectangular bar, at six or so small tables with stools, or at one of four high-backed booths; the fourth side of the bar is a wall with a garage-door type opening which will serve drinks to outdoor patio patrons in warmer weather (right now it is just a wall).  There is also a separate, smaller room with tables and table service.  There are two televisions in the main room and you would have a good view of them if you were at one of the spots on the bar close to the TVs.  This is not a TV/sports bar but, if you could score a spot near one of the TVs, it would be a fine place for a few people to watch a game. The servers and owners could not have been nicer.  They were quick to offer suggestions for food or beer and seemed very appreciative of the customers.  They were eager to share their vision of the Cypress Street Pint & Plate and to get feedback.  They seemed devoted to really make this place work.  And, all the patrons were friendly, too - everyone was meeting and talking to each other.  I have not been in a bar like that for a long time.I ordered Margherita pizza as a light meal/appetizer with my house brew beer.  It had a good, crispy, irregularly shaped crust, with a nice sauce and mozzarella cheese.  I have also tried the spinach and artichoke fondue and the Terrapin ale - both very good.  I saw several orders of nachos go past me and they looked and smelled delicious.  Other patrons swore by the meatball sliders, which are three Krystal-sized sandwiches with a meatball, sauce and arugula on each. Cypress Street is clearly a bar but they do seem to have good food based on what I ate, saw, smelled and heard.I am so happy to have Cypress Street in the neighborhood.  It is shaping up to be a perfect neighborhood bar and I hope it can continue in that direction.  I will definitely be going back - soon!UPDATE 5/5/08: Cypress Street now has brunch on Sundays and it is quite good.  There are a lot of egg and omelette dishes which were appealing and some starchy griddle stuff, too.  I had the Mile High omelette and it was delish.  I got mine with grits and a biscuit and it was a steal!  My diet may be in jeopardy."},{"name":"Tacodeli","address":"4200 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place rules.

The SE Portland location is great - been there 10x, dim sum and dinner, and always fantastic.  A year or two ago we noticed this location, I think because it opened recently.  First few times it was on par.  But more recently it has been way sub-par.  I think they changed management or lost their cooks or both.  Service has dropped off a cliff.  Last time in there the restaurant was about 4/5 full, and we waited 40 minutes for our first dish - hot and sour soup - to be served.  Then it was another 15 minutes or so for the second dish (beijing duck), they brought it out sliced off and served the skin, then wheeled the duck away promising to slice the rest of the duck up and bring it right back.  It was another 15 minutes before we saw the duck again.  And another half hour after that with no sight of any of the other dishes we ordered!  We asked a couple times, and each time were assured the food was being cooked and was on the way, but it never showed up.  Each assurance came with an apology and a new explanations for the slowness - a busy time of day, a big party over there, and later, we're short handed in the kitchen.  We finally ran out of patience and told them we had to leave - we'd been there over an hour and a half.  The manager apologized very politely and offered to pay for our meal, which was a nice gesture, but after an hour and a half and still only getting half of our meal we weren't overly impressed.  As we were putting on our jackets to leave, a waitress came running out of the kitchen with one more of the four dishes we ordered bagged up for us to take out, again, they were trying.

My puff overfilled with creme, and the dinky napkins provided were useless. Also, they dusted it unnecessary with powdered sugar, making the unwieldy treat even more unwieldy. My boyfriend's chocolate filled puff met the same fate, although I say that the chocolate filling is not what I imagined -- less like pudding, more like light-flavored mousse.I've been back a couple of times since, and it seems that they're getting the hang of filling the puffs. The ratio of cream to puff is more like 70% cream, 30% puff than 90% cream, 10% puff the first time I had it.The regular custard is nice, with a nice vanilla bean kick. I've only had the regular puff, so I can't comment on the eclair or cookie puffs. The regular is light and crispy, but it won't break into gum-slicing shards.The mochi is just all right, but I would never pay that much for such a little thing when I can head to the nearest asian supermarket and buy half a dozen mochi ice creams twice the size of the ones sold at BP for a dollar or two more.I am willing to go back and try other filling flavors, but I'm not compelled to. It's a novelty, and a slightly pricey one for what it is.The store itself is tiny, and I would just recommend you walk and eat since the puffs are pretty much handheld."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh my.  Good BBQ in central Austin is puzzlingly hard to find.  My first encounter with Franklin was mid afternoon during the Trailer crawl.  They were out of brisket and pork ribs, but offered me pulled pork.  It was just ok, and I probably would have forgotten about this place except that it kept appearing on \\"hot on yelp\\"So, I made it back today (Sunday) at 12:40 pm (they open at 11am).  Sure enough, they were out of the pork ribs, and cut the line off 4-5 people behind us.  Holy Brisket - we ordered the lean and fat brisket - both were tender, thick cuts of meat - and all at very good prices ($7-$8/lb)- they sell by plates (but were out of all sides), and also in sandwiches.  Skip the pork and go for the brisket and what appears to be the other hot seller, pork ribs!  Salt lick used to be my favorite brisket until I had you Franklin, and you are so so much closer.  And yes, the meats stand alone but the sauces are also delish - my first experience with an espresso bbq sauce!The big downside which appears heavily covered in reviews is the fact that they run out early (and they are a little slow in delivering..it takes 2-3 minutes per person for something that is already made."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Before I get hate mail let me preface this review by saying that I've tried Franklin's 3x. First 2 times they ran out of ribs and brisket.   This is a culmination to those 3 visits. Basically there are 6 Phases to The Franklin's (waiting) Experience.  I. The initial wait. So we arrive at 9:15. Having not eaten breakfast I was hungry and grumpy. Our place in line was behind the smoker by the big ass tree with poison ivy.  The line is ridiculous.  Many questions surface. Do these ppl not work?  do they take a half day?  This wait is tolerable because adrenaline is the pure motivation. II.  The wait by the smoker. It's 10:50. They start letting ppl in. The waiting by the smoker is perhaps the most difficult of the waits. You see apron clan ppl coming in and out. Adding wood and taking in meat.  A man in a cart carrying drinks is selling them to patrons waiting.  I'm very hungry at this point. My body moderately begins to sweat from the smell of the meat.  III. The \\"I made it to the steps\\" wait. 11:30. Man comes out in angry voice. \\"Know what you want to order so the line will move faster, and we're almost out of brisket.\\"  My mood-o-meter is now frustrated.  Out of brisket???  I'm not going to rehash my previous 2 visits and leave feeling empty handed let alone empty stomach-ed. IV. The \\" I made it to the door\\" wait. 12:05. I'm pissed off now. Theres a burning hole in my stomach. I'm not sure if there will be brisket left. There are questions of leaving my place in line. But I'm already committed. My relationship with Franklins is skidding to a near termination.  But I regroup and begin to have positive thoughts.  I give way to Franklins for the better good of our relationship. Im sacrificing my body at this point. By this point, I'm inside the door. There are tshirts but only S and M. Damn fatties taking my size!!!!!  The door wait is the hardest. I almost offered the guy triple what he paid for his meats. Sounds dirty?  Get your head out of the gutter. V. The ordering. I don't remember who helped us. But the only thing that came out of his mouth were three phrases. \\"What can I get you?\\"  And. \\"What else?\\"  \\"What else?\\". \\"What else?\\". \\"That all?\\". He handed back my credit card covered in meat grease. 12:15VI. Eating.  12:25. I honestly can't say I enjoyed it. I was way too hungry to observe flavor profiles. Tenderness and/or moistness. There was no time for saucing, no forks used.  Had the brisket and beef ribs.  My complaint is more towards the ribs. Guy gave me 3 un-edible ends. \\nFinal thoughts. Maybe incorporate free water. Better waiting experience. Belly BBQ dancers?  The future to our relationship is give and take. You cant take take take. The BBQ product is solid.  Let me repeat.  SOLID BBQ.  But...and this is a \\"Big But(t)\\" I'd like to see how they harness this success.   Wish nothing but the best and less waiting. 3 hrs (THREE, Tres, YES  T-H-R-E-E) is a bit much."},{"name":"House of Empanadas","address":"976 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Tried the tes de leche.

I have no idea how it compares to the original one on East 11th.   On one hand, this place is cool and hip and a much-needed addition to Westlake's restaurant scene, but it's the little things that bother me: These were the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in - if you have a padded ass, you'll really be grateful. There are no four-tops here, just two-tops pushed together, and they never quite align with one another. They also have long monastery-type tables for big groups. And of course this is all subjective, but I thought the interior layout was just quirky - you're either seated next to the entrance door that's opening and closing all the time, or in that odd back section with a view of the bathrooms. If the weather's decent, ask for the patio section - remember, no one will be smoking next to you in Westlake.I enjoyed my seaweed & tofu salad, if perhaps a tad overpriced. The Porcini Ravioli was decent, and the basil pesto here is superb. The taste I had of my companion's Bouillabaisse was intriguing - not too fishy or salty - but the one closed mussel I spotted in the bowl put me right off. I loved the bottles of olive oil and Balsamic vinegar and the peppercorn grinder on the table. The flourless chocolate cake with raspberries was excellent. Blue Dahlia does great bread.Happy Hour rules here, the meat-and-cheese boards and most tartines are nearly half-price. I'll take your word about the booze. If they had only toasted the bread and slipped our brie with apricot & walnuts under a broiler for seven-seconds, I'd be raving about it. But it's still a good value. The service and our server Jeanine was great. I keep hearing how my life will not be complete until I've tried Blue Dahlia's breakfast & brunch items, so I'm planning on making a return visit soon, hopefully before my life is over, in order to be complete.

I love Asian noodle restaurants. Especially Chinese ones. Once I saw that open sign light up it was time for me to head in and try this place out! I came in this afternoon with an open mind and big appetite.  I perused through the menu and saw exactly what I would come in for as a baseline to compare this restaurants with the many Chinese noodle restaurants. I ordered the Chow Ma Mein, Potstickers, and the Taipei Red Wings.  The service from the initial start was very good. I'm sure as any new place will be, they will be on their best behavior and it will exemplify in their service. Tea was kept full and the food did not take long to come. I was first served the Taipei Red Wings. In their menu it was stated that it was very spicy. After having my first wing. I found that it had a bit of tickle but it was not spicy to me. Bear in mind, most Chinese people don't eat spicy so something like this for most all Chinese people would be very spicy. Now here's where the plot thickens. With most Chinese restaurants they suffer from death by over battering.  Based on the coating of the wings I'm going to definitely say wet batter. The nice part of a wet batter when it is served right out the kitchen its really crunchy but it doesn't take long before it starts to get soggy. The chicken was  tossed in a light spicy sauce with fresh chilies. Once I received the wings it was already starting to get a little bit on the soggy side. The taste was overall very good and what I enjoyed about it is the fact the wings wasn't tossed in a obvious chili sauce or oil to make it spicier. It was done very originally and the spice accented the flavor not overpowering it. Next, I received the potstickers. The dough was the right amount of thickness. The sear on the skin was perfect and the culmination of the ground pork, green onions, and cabbage was made in perfect harmony. The sauce served with the potstickers was good but I did require chili oil to give it a bit of a kick. I probably would have preferred a little bit of vinegar to give it some tang as well. As for the main dish the chow ma mein was one of the better ones I've ever had. The Seafood was cooked to perfection. Scallops were delicate. Squid was not rubbery. Shrimp was not overcooked and the clams once again cooked for the right amount of time keeping it from being very rubbery. The veggies and the noodles cooked to perfection. Making the combination of the broth even more enjoyable. Overall I really enjoyed the meal. Was it the best Chinese I've ever had? Not really. I don't really go out to Chinese much as I've mentioned before if I want good Chinese I just go back to my parents house or cook it myself. Ask me if I'll come back again. I'm pretty sure I will. The service was really good here and the atmosphere was very relaxing. It also looks like they're getting a liquor license as well. I'm sure this place will thrive. For now I would give it a good 3.5 stars but I want to try it again for the regular menu and see how it goes.

Both meals are pretty massive on their own, so I really didn't need to go with both, but I had to try them.The spicy chicken hoagie wasn't all that spicy to me, and we both didn't think it had a whole lot of flavor. The raw veggies on top added some crunch to it, but overall I thought it was pretty bland and had to add some Sriracha (which I don't really like doing) to give it some zing. The Kimchi hot dog was a little better, but one again I really thought it could have used some stronger flavors. I like that you get to taste the beef dog, but it's such a massive dog that it all but covers up the rest of the flavors.I'll try to get back to try the cheese steak again, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get my friend too, so I'm a little bummed out it wasn't on the menu at the time.

We also really enjoyed the house made ginger soda.  Service was excellent."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Ramen is pretty subjective. I've been ecstatic over instant bowl ramen and disappointed over gourmet bowls...so when it comes to Ramen TatsuYa, which guarantees at least a 30-45 min wait between getting into line and receiving your bowl, I thought it was good, but I'd only return if I were in the throes of a serious ramen craving.First, this place is ridiculously busy. It's like they knew they would get tons of business so they made their store teeny tiny so it would force a line to form outside the store, thus attracting more people, thus making the wait here even longer. Genius move on their part, sucky for the customers. I came during the winter, so I went from standing in line in the cold staring into the store (none of the outdoor heaters were turned on, blerg) to standing inside in line staring at the menu to finally sitting down at a table...and then getting stared at by all the people still waiting outside. Wonderful.Second, make sure you know that they assign seating to parties as they approach the register. I came in a group of 7 and wasn't aware that my group had already been assigned a table (the waitress only approached the first 2 people in our group), so I sat down at a nearby table hoping to save it. I was approached by a harried waitress who looked at me like I was a misbehaving student for sitting down without her permission. They eventually managed to seat us together, but it a big hassle and more stressful than it needed to be. The waiter delivering our food was pretty impatient (we get it, you are SUPER busy...) and several of our bowls got mixed up because we weren't familiar with the Japanese lingo they used for each extra ingredient.Last, the food. The broth was too fatty and heavy for my liking, but it had great flavor. I'm a fan of lighter broths with more delicate flavors, so that's a personal preference. The noodles were perfect - chewy, plentiful, and cooked to al dente. The pork belly was mostly fat, but super tender and tasty. The marinated egg was prob one of my favorite bites in the bowl, with a juicy yolk soaked in saucy goodness. The \\"bombs\\" on the menu are side dishes that you can add into your bowl; we tried the corn bomb and the chili bomb, they weren't anything too special IMO and I wouldn't re-order them. In conclusion, I like most bowls of ramen, so I liked this one, but it wasn't worth the huge wait or having to deal with stressed out wait staff. Also, don't bring large groups here. If you do bring a date here, try to not sit right next to the windows because people waiting outside will stare at you, which makes for an uncomfortable eating experience."},{"name":"The Squealing Pig","address":"134 Smith St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"If you're in the Longwood area, you might miss this place. It's a small restaurant that's tucked away at the corner of Brigham Circle station. When I saw the name of the restaurant, I thought there would be a lot of pork dishes....but that wasn't the case. The menu offers an array of typical selections you would get at a typical pub (seafood, salad, flatbread, burgers, etc). I decided to order the crispy calamari and flatbread topped with prosciutto, fig jam, and gorgonzola. The crispy calamari was very bland (no seasoning at all) and the accompanying sauce tasted like diluted ketchup with a hint of sriracha (not good). I had way better calamari (at the same price range as Squealing Pig) elsewhere.The flatbread was decent but not spectacular. Flavor-wise, I like the subtle sweetness that the fig jam gives and the saltiness from the gorgonzola and prosciutto. The execution needs more work: I struggled with eating the flatbread because the prosciutto laid as sheets (see attached picture). So when I take a bite, the entire sheet of prosciutto would come off the slice of pizza. I decided to remove the prosciutto and set it aside on my plate to eat later. I would suggest cutting the prosciutto into smaller pieces and sprinkling it over the flatbread to make it easier for the consumer. The wood table I was seated was not flat. So, my plates would lay at an angle and tilt back and forth as I try to eat my meal (So annoying!).Overall, it's a nice place if you want typical pub food but I would not come back here again."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Just updating to say that Border Cafe is still my favorite restaurant in the world!

We also had carrots( tasty), oysters (didn't taste like any fried oysters I have eaten ever0, pancakes, fascinating with popcorn).  One needs to check on how much spice, pepper or pickle is in each dish (regrettably we did not) because it can be quite intense.  If you like a gin martini, get it somewhere else.  The martini is made with Citadel, a French gin, which has a strong taste of its own that does not resemble Plymouth, Tanqueray or any other martini ingredient.

We headed over on a random weekday after work, and we were surprised that that it had a decent amount of diners. Zabu Chicken offers Korean fried chicken and beer, and most of their diners are Korean. By 7:00 pm, the place shut off their lights and had some night club music going on. Contrary to what many people had said about their poor service, I actually didn't find it a problem and the service was quite attentive. Food did take quite some time to come out, but since we had our drinks, it wasn't too much of a problem.After you place your order, you get some complimentary dishes. They served us Coleslaw as well as some Pickled Radish. At first, we thought the dishes were pretty underwhelming, but once you have some beer and chicken, you will appreciate it. The sourness of the pickled radish will help you cool down from the spicy chicken.With fried chicken, you have to get some beer. We ended up getting two pitchers of Sapporo for the night. Not the cheapest, but at $17, it was a reasonable price to share. I like how they provide you with beer mugs which have been put in the freezer so that your beer is kept cold.We decided to share a few dishes and started off with the Zabu Hot Combo. You can choose between medium and large size. We went with the medium, and you get a mix of wings and drumsticks. These were delicious! They are spicy, but a tolerable one and great with beer. The batter is so crispy! Something about it just tastes a lot different compared to American fried chicken. The sauce makes the chicken moist, but you still get the crispiness. The meat is also kept moist and tender.We also got their original Zabu Soy Combo, and we got this in large. These were also very delicious, and it had a nice sweet taste to it. A must order! It's funny because you can also order a whole chicken... When we asked the server about it, she said they literally chop up the whole chicken and fry it...Overall, we were extremely satisfied with Zabu Chicken. The fried chicken isn't the cheapest, but I've realized that fried chicken can be quite expensive. I also liked how we were able to sit around and chat and continue drinking our beer and the servers didn't kick us out. Cool place to chill at night!Pros:\\n- Chicken is crispy and moist\\n- Fun, chill place to drink and hang with friendsCons:\\n- Prices aren't exactly cheap"},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Fried leeks?

Tatsu-ya had a huge number of reviews and is close by, so off we went.  Eric R. parked when he saw the hard-to-read sign and determined that this was probably that right place.  He was correct, and we walked in to a long line of hungry people.  The place is small and was packed, which surprised on a rainy Monday.  Many of the restaurants in the area are closed on Mondays.  The line went pretty quickly, but one thing that was a bit strange was the conversation with one of the staff and the woman in front of us in line.  The staff person was trying to figure out how many people were in each party so she could tell us where to sit.  The woman in front of us said she wanted a to-go order.  The staff person insisted that this was a dine-in only restaurant and they do not want their food to go because it is not made for that.  The woman insisted she had ordered to-go at this very place in the past and seemed annoyed.  She was pulled from the line and taken to a corner to order, and the staff person told her they would bring the order out and with to-go containers.  It was just bizarre.Anyway, we were next and were designated a place to sit once we ordered with the cashier.  I noticed on a scribbled sign on the bar near the register that there was a cucumber lemonade with yuzu and a shiso rim so I had to order that!  I opted to have it without the shot of sake.  Eric R. ordered the miso ramen and I ordered the ol skool which is chicken shoyu broth but I ordered it without the chashu.  Instead, I added the yuzu kosho bomb and flash-fried brussel sprouts.  The dessert on the menu was yuzupioca, a yuzu tapioca dessert.  I knew I would be full from the ramen so I will have to return to try this.We got our food quickly and happily munched away on our bowls.  My noodles were wavier and slightly thicker than Eric R.'s but we were not sure what the difference was - just noticed that for whatever reason.  The yuzu kosho bomb was very spicy but added a nice kick to my broth (it is made in-house with fresh peppers rather than from a jar).  The ajitama was very good, and I always save it for last.  We were filled and left with our bellies happy.  I did not notice while I was eating but later on I felt like a garlic-breathing dragon so I guess there was a lot of garlic in my broth.  At least no vampires will be coming over anytime soon!

That feeling when you finish your bowl, slouch back in your seat with your belly spilling over your pants, and struggle to breathe with a stomach full of satisfaction, you know you've just had a good bowl of ramen. The broth has the thick, richness you expect out of a tonkotsu broth. Plenty of flavor, salt level, and mouthfeel. The fat coats the inside of your mouth in porky goodness, and thickness of the broth goes down heavy (in a good way). This isn't a delicate bowl of ramen, it's a serious bowl of noodles. Those averse to fat, salt, or happiness shouldn't bother.The noodles are hakata style noodles (less alkaline salt in the dough). They're thin, straight, and have less bounce and more bite than most ramen noodles. Even though they're thinner, they still stand up against the rich broth very well. In short, the noodles match perfectly with the broth.The chashu was tender and flavorful, everything chashu should be. The egg was marinated well and nice and runny in the center. Pretty much the only complaint I have is that there's not a comparable ramen shop in DFW. I also tried my girlfriend's tsukemen and my friend's spicy miso ramen. Both were really good, but the original is where it's at."},{"name":"Ward 8","address":"90 N Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Amazing, incredible, juicy and flavorful duck wings.

It was my first time there, so I went with the fried chicken with collards.   My entree was delicious! My friend ordered the duck medium rare. She was unsure of what temperature to order, so she went with the chef's recommendation. It was too rare for her liking and the server very kindly had the chef cook it a little more.

I can remember many firsts (first kiss, first speeding ticket, first time ummmmm) well I digress.  The first time going to your joint fighting I35 gridlock traffic at morning rush hour to get in line. I HATE gridlock traffic  but, I had to try this mystical place called Franklin bbq. I got there @ 8 am and was 9th in line assuring myself of a taste of your product.  I waited patiently for the 3 hours until you open the doors. It was actually pleasant because of the build up hearing all the hype about this place. When the time finally came and I got up to the counter I ordered some moist brisket (I'm from Kansas City & we call this the point -think burnt ends).  The brisket was very good,  no doubt. It was moist,  tender,  had a nice smoky flavor as well.  What blew my mind was paying  $18/lb. for said brisket. I left thinking it was very good but also very expensive.Fast forward a year and had the opportunity to return.  I got stuck in the same crappy, gridlock traffic as the first time and this time it just wasn't as magical. After going 3 MPH for 6 miles to get there, I knew I had to get in line. I was half way back in line but knew I would at least be ok to get some bbq.  Like I said,  the first time is always the best so sitting in line for 3 hours just didn't seem as fun. The guy ahead of me said it was his 76th time coming and I thought to myself, why in the hell would anyone want to sit in this line 76 times?  Hell no, not  me! The mystique has definitely wore off and this was only my 2nd visit.  I waited the 3 hours in line for the doors to open and then it took another hour just to make it up to the counter. I ordered 1 lb. of moist brisket,  1 lb. of ribs, 1 sausage link, & 1/2 lb. of pulled pork.  The brisket is GOOD, I did NOT say great. I said good. The sausage was okay, nothing to remember about it.  the ribs were also good. Franklin only uses salt & pepper for all his meats so that is about as basic flavor profile as you can get. the ribs were tender but also fatty. The pork was terrible. I knew the second I ordered it I made a mistake because the dude behind the counter reached into a steam table pan and got some pork that had been already broken down.  The pork was flavorless and definitely dry.  I had to drown it in some expresso sauce to get some kind of flavor going on and to help with the moisture to at least be able to swallow it.  When I was done,  all I could think about is the hype has overtaken the mystique  and the diamond isn't nearly as sparkly as it once was.  Also Franklin is charging astronomical prices for his product- $20/lb. for brisket, $18/lb. for ribs, $17/lb. for pork. You are paying tremendously for the hype.  Walking out of there the mystique has quickly worn off for many reasons. The wait, the crazy sky high prices, and the fact that there are many other places that are just as good and so much cheaper (Black's, louie Mueller, Salt Lick). Sorry Aaron, I won't be standing in your line ever again until you come down from the clouds and back to earth. Just because you have gotten some recognition doesn't mean other places are not as good or as worthy as you. So, I guess here is my official star review of the entire experience. waiting in line for 3-4 hours..... ZERO stars\\n$20/lb. brisket..... 4 stars but insanely expensive \\n$18 pork ribs...... 3 stars. salt/pepper/6 hours in a smoker- big whoop\\n$18/lb. pork.....ZERO stars, terrible. flavorless and dry, and so forgettable. \\nsausage. ....3 stars but also forgettable.Oh, one more thing.

The antipasto was essentially a grilled chicken caesar salad with italian dressing. My wife's risotto with wild mushrooms and figs, turned out to be salty rice with a minuscule amount of shrooms and no figs. My ciopinno in spicy marinara was a collection of fishy tasting mussels and smashed clams and overlooked fish in a gloppy, disgusting tomato sauce that was neither spice nor tasty. My mothers pork loin was overcooked and dry. My son's tilapia was okay, but nothing special.

The restaurant itself is in a cool part of town, there are a lot of older houses with a lot of character. I got the half-rack with a side of potato salad and macaroni and cheese. The wife and I both agreed it was some of the best macaroni and cheese we had ever had, anywhere. I wasn't very crazy about the potato salad although I usually don't like any potato salad that isn't homemade. The ribs themselves were good in a lot of ways although I was disappointed with some aspects of their ribs also. For starters, the meat they brought out was barely warm, in fact, in five more minutes, it probably would have been slightly cold and that by itself cost them a star. The meat was good quality and literally did fall off the bone. The seasoning kind of surprised me since it had sort of an Asian-influenced taste to it. It had a teriyaki flavor in my opinion that I would expect to find in Heirloom Market BBQ instead of here. Actually, Heirloom Market's BBQ didn't taste like teriyaki, I was referring to the overall Asian influence in the flavor of the meat. I also felt like the amount of food that we got for what we were charged wasn't right. We have received a lot more for less money at some of the other BBQ joints I have been to. The woman that was our server was very pleasant and someone that I think was the manager came by and spoke to us and was very nice also. There was one guy that got my wife's plate off of the table (he was Spanish) and my wife spoke to him in Spanish (her native language) and he just ignored her, which I thought was pretty rude.

I've had better fried chicken, it was sous vide prior to frying and i felt it zapped out some of the greasy chicken juices that make really good chicken, the batter could also use a touch more seasoning, but otherwise fairly good, it was MUCH better slathered in chili sauce. The tongue beef tacos were good, some of the pieces of tongue were chewy but all of the condiments were fresh, especially the creme fraiche, which tasted more like butter and elevated the tacos. It was cold and windy outside and they gave us some blankets to keep us warm which was awesome, I wish every restaurant offered blankets! The asian pear french toast with coconut milk and lime was great, it had a grilled/fried outer coating and was custard like middle. The menu said it came with toffee but instead there was an asian custard and micro herbs, which was a nice substitution but..left us missing the toffee. The french toast could have used just a bit more liquid, maybe a pear black vinegar syrup or something to keep every bite moist as the custard swipe underneath didn't add enough moisture. $100 brunch won't make this an every day place for me, but next time, I'll order less food and less 10 a pop drinks."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"2728 New Spring Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"During the Snowmageddon of 2014 we were stranded like the rest of Atlanta.

Wife is probably right, it's not really quite the ambiance you might want for a Saturday night dinner, but it works fine when we don't want to venture far and are feeling worn out on a Friday.  I guess that S&S is like Collonade or Mary Mac's, but without the 'coolness' factor.Oh, and be sure and tip your waiter/waitress.  They are very helpful and I think it's appropriate even if it's not a traditional take-your-order type restaurant."},{"name":"Davis Bakery and Company","address":"12001 Avalon Lake Dr, Ste G","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I so want to love Davis Bakery. But it really is a hit and miss with them. their food is fantastic when it is fresh and when they don't get cheap with the portions. It's a 50 percent gamble that you will get the fresh stuff. I order their house salads which are the absolute best when they put their best in it, but usually the chicken is old and barely any cheese. I can guarantee you that if it is a female that takes your order or gives you customer service it will be very POOR. The girls they have working there are rude, slow and don't know how to treat customers. there is young guy who works there who I try to get to serve or take my order because he is the only who does it decently.

This is the worst service I have definitely had in a long time. I was seated outdoors, and to start, it took the server quite some time to make it over to us. We started with an appetizer and a salad (Throwback Korean BBQ Tacos and a Local Mixed Greens Salad). The tacos were tasty- the meat was flavorful and the spiciness of the kimchi wasn't overwhelming. The salad was light and refreshing, but very basic. After finishing our appetizers, our server came over multiple times to fill our water (spilling on me multiple times), but never removed our dirty plates. I had to ask him, and he acted clueless about this.  When our meal came, I was served the haddock, although I had ordered the flounder, so I had to send my meal back. My husband ordered the Steak Frites, and the fries were served to him ice cold. We told the runner that the fries were cold and requested she bring some fresh fries. She insisted she had to take his meal back into the kitchen, despite us requesting not to because then his steak would get cold. Our server then came by and we also asked him if the steak could be returned, which he said yes, but did nothing about. After waiting another 10 minutes or so, we were both again served our meal. They promised my husband's steak wasn't cold because it had been sitting under the light while fresh fries were cooked, however when he cut into it, it was now well done instead of medium rare, because it had been sitting under the warmth of the light. Another 10 minutes later and his meal was served to him, while at this point I was through with mine, as I didn't want mine to get cold. Meanwhile, he didn't have any silverware and it took a good 5 minutes to grab someone's attention to get him a fork and a knife. The Crispy Flounder Filet was quite good, with a nice crispy flavor, and a hint of spice from the Spicy Uni Shrimp butter. The fried green tomatoes that were served with the meal were tasty, especially dipped in the butter sauce. Once my husband's meal was eventually served, I enjoyed a few bites of his Steak Frites with Grilled Skirt Steak. The Bourbon porcini Demi glac√© gave it some nice flavor. The fries were good, but nothing amazing. We ordered the Sex on the Beach sorbet for dessert, which was super fruity and sweet. The texture was a bit off for a sorbet, and was more hard and icy than anticipated. Others around us seemed to be enjoying themselves- but I just can't same the same thing about our experience. The service was so disappointing, I can't give it more than 1 star despite the food being pretty good."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"A first for us and Mimi the waiter was very helpful with suggestions on sushi.

Love the smiling servers.This place is comparable to other lunches places, but the murderous omnivore in me is asking, \\"Where is the meat?!\\" When did vegetables start costing the same as meat? However, disregarding that detail, the food here is very top notch. Given that my friend and I were never vegetarian to begin with, we opted for the easy route and picked what Yelp suggested, chickpea fritters and rosemary fries. The chickpea fritters reminded me of falafels, which is technically what it is, and they were fried to a good texture and consistency. Flavor was a bit fusion mixing traditional Halal flavoring with Americanized additions like bean sprouts. The rosemary fries were a bit overdone and were dark like they were using old oil, but this may just be that they were using healthy organic oils that tend to burn quicker. The rosemary gave a good flavor, but they themselves are incredibly stiff and hard, forcing me to pick them out. The turnaround was fine especially since we can see the chef make our food so the wait feels not too bad. Service was also adequate and I always appreciate the ones who smile a lot to help brighten the day."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Have only been here for brunch, but it is a pretty amazing brunch.

I've recently been doing brunch more often and this is one of the few places that after the meal I was extremely curious about their dinner service.You walk in and immediately it's a beautiful fancy and cozy bistro. Even my friend who's a chef peeked into the kitchen and said it's extremely well set up. And by cozy I don't mean you feel squeezed by any means, the seating is actually quite spacious and comfortable to sit. Compared to most busy brunch spots these days where line-up is long to be finally seated by the door with the waiting guests hovering over you as you eat.I arrived late so my wife ordered me something simple - a ham and eggs benny. When my plate arrived, it jumped out at me with the beautifully slow-roast tomato which I've never had. Then the micro-salad was dressed in a light yet savoury sauce that I couldn't tell what was in it. Our table was next to the bar and it was so beautiful and grandeur with the dark wood, I just had to order a drink. Just a Stella on tap did the trick.Then the biggest surprise - the price. As I mentioned I arrived late and didn't see the menu. I expected premium pricing even more so than the going rate of brunches these days, as it was fancier than the trendy brunch spots around town. Price was still an extremely competitive $11 for my eggs benny. I think I paid more at just a tiny hip cafe where I was tightly seated with minimal elbow room.I will definitely be back for dinner!

Been here since 8:30AM and have been told that I can expect to eat a pound of brisket ($20) and two sausage links ($3/link) at noon (today). When I woke up at 7:30AM with my girlfriend, the absurdity of waiting in line for the food had barely hit me, and then when I got to Franklin, I felt it even more. What had I decided to do? Thankfully, I prepared with two books -- Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson and Surrounded by Friends by Matthew Rohrer -- and a stack of poems by Logan Fry to read and think over. Not to mention three leftover Happy Camper IPAs (New Mexico). Something happened, however, while waiting in line. More people came. The sky somehow turned bluer than sky blue. My girlfriend and I sat maybe 30th in line, and the line continued to grow. Everyone had chairs, and we did too. Franklin gives them out. And people were drinking -- still are, actually -- and meeting new people and hopping all parts of the line. Someone said, \\"I like your shirt.\\" And someone else said, \\"Thank you! I like your shoes.\\" Numbers were exchanged and plans were made. \\"See you at the Green Belt later this week.\\" Others left the line, never to return. And some did, looking hairier, skinnier, larger (in the best possible sense). Some came bearing more beers or doughnuts. I put my hand on the cement and for a second felt an ant crawling up my arm. The crowd grew and music could be heard somewhere in the distance, muffled by the conversation all around.

We ordered several dishes and every one was a winner! Chicken liver mousse plate was fantastic as was a smoked fish gratin. The best of all was the boudin blanc burger (a sausage patty made up of chicken, pork and rabbit), it was the hit of the night and one of the best burgers I've ever had. Finished off the meal with a dessert of almond brandy cake, with housemade caramel ice cream, caramel popcorn and chantilly cream.

Everything had been eaten.As for customer service, they were very accommodating with the design of the cake and the choices for the pastries. Overall it was a pleasure to work with them.  My cake was non-traditional as I had requested fresh fruit instead of sugar flowers or other traditional designs.

We arrived at the 5:30 PM opening time and got seated right away - they filled up rather quickly. So many yummy sounding choices on the menu, but I was on a mission for fried chicken.We started with the hush puppies - crispy, not oily, exterior and moist, steaming goodness within. They came with an excellent honey mustard sauce, but they were so delicious I couldn't stand to adulterate them.Ronda ordered seared scallops and a roasted beet salad. The scallops were perfect and perfectly presented on a bed of marinated artichoke and steamed spinach. The salad was fresh and lightly dressed, with generous wedges of roasted beet.I ordered the fried chicken (of course). I was disappointed to learn that it would come boneless (I really enjoy primal gnawing) but have to admit that this was some of the best chicken I've had in a long time. Half a breast plus a thigh, crispy (again, not oily) coating with moist meat inside. Certainly five star stuff and very close to perfect. The mashed potatoes and gravy were just fine. The greens were good, but not nearly to the standard of those from Russell Street. Not realizing I would be getting a vegetable side, I ordered the Brussels sprout and rainbow carrot side. This disappointed me. The vegetables were fine, but they came bathed in a creamy dressing that just didn't do it for me.The food seemed a bit slow to arrive (in comparison to the tables around us) but not too bad - service in general was good. We had no room to try desserts but after reviewing that menu we made mental notes to order less food next time to indulge at the end.So, if I hadn't ordered the Brussels sprout/carrot side, this would have been a five star review.

And Jake's has managed to exceed all of my expectations. It was pricey, but not unreasonable given the quality. You will not be disappointed. WHAT I TRIED ( 5 stars)\\nPopcorn Crawfish Tails with Sherry Wine Aioli ($14.25): \\nThis is the one crawfish dish that we ordered, as our server told us that it was not the season for crawfish. The popcorn crawfish tails weren't jaw-droppingly delicious, but well cooked, and tasty. Usually I steer clear of \\"popcorn\\" foods as they tend to be overly greasy, but Jake's did a very good job of getting the crunch without making the coating too thick or greasy. The Sherry Wine Aioli was tasty, but I ended up dipping most of my popcorn crawfish tails into the garlic butter of the baked escargot :) Now that combination was absolutely divine and I cannot wait to return to order those two again. Baked Escargot with Garlic Butter ($13.99): \\nI LOVED the garlic butter this came in. The escargot was well cooked and tender, but the star of the dish had to be the garlic butter. It was delicious, without being overpowering and too rich. I am usually not a fan of garlic, but I could not keep myself away. I was dipping the popcorn crawfish tails, and the bread in this sauce. ABSOLUTELY DIVINE. Dungeness Crab and Bay Shrimp Stuffed Salmon ($39.50): \\nTHIS WAS ONE THE BEST SALMON I HAVE TASTED IN MY LIFE. Usually when I order salmon, the outer layers are overcooked, or the inner layers are too pink and undercooked. Both my father and I have never seen salmon so well / uniformly cooked. The stuffing was just as amazing. The crab and shrimp were well cooked, and soft. The brie / cream cheese mixture that it was mixed in gave it the most creamy consistency, which went perfectly with the salmon. This is a must try if you stop by!Jake's Clam Chowder ($7.25 - Bowl): \\nAs a San Francisco native, I am a clam chowder snob. I figured I would try Jake's clam chowder, as anything that has \\"Jake's\\" attached to its name should be well done. The clam chowder lived up to my expectations. Creamy without being too rich, and bursting with the seafood's flavor. I have had too many clam chowders where the cream overwhelms the taste of everything else in the soup. I was delightfully surprised to find that the seafood was the star of the dish, instead of the cream. The bowl is big enough to be a main dish, and it was shared by a few people. Seafood Fettuccine ($25.49): \\nI only tried a bite of this one, but its that one bite I could tell that the seafood flavor really shone. As with the clam chowder, any pasta with a cream sauce comes with the danger of the cream overwhelming the other tastes. I've tried too many fettuccines where the cream sauce overwhelms the other tastes. The balance was superb. Jake's √âtouff√©e ($25.99): \\nThis was an interesting dish. The server brought out a large dish with a mound of rice in the center, and a small pot with the √©touff√©e inside. You ladle the √©touff√©e onto the rice. I only tried a few bites of this as well, but it was very well received by my family. The sauce was rich, with a very subtle hint of spice. Seafood was well cooked as well. Kind of a gumbo style dish. It was not exotic, but it was very comforting and well done.FOOD QUALITY / TASTE ( 5 stars)\\nJake's does a marvelous job of balancing the flavors. I never experienced one flavor overpowering another, or overpowering the rest. All of the dishes were masterfully balanced, and while one flavor would be the star in a dish, it would never overpower the others. I have never experienced this amazing balance before, and now I see why Jake's is one of the premier seafood restaurants on the West Coast. The seafood was fresh, and the overall food quality was amazing. The complimentary bread was also high quality, with a delightful whipped butter. CUSTOMER SERVICE ( 4 stars)\\nVery polite, but not as responsive as some of the other restaurants I've been to. Then again, it was incredibly busy. Didn't detract from my enjoyment of the food however. PRICE ( 5 stars)\\nThe total for 4 was roughly 130 before tip, which is very reasonable considering the food quality. I've gotten lesser seafood for higher prices. Very worth it. ACCESSIBILITY ( 5 stars)\\nMy family and I were lucky enough to find street parking right outside. We did come at 4:45, before the dinner rush, which the server told me usually begins around 5:30. Thus we were seated right away as well. If not street parking, I believe that there are garages nearby. AMBIANCE ( 5 stars)\\nDecoration was traditional and beautiful. The slightly dim lighting went well with the ambiance."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"A little over priced with a limited and unoriginal menu.

Even though it rests in such a high traffic area, its pretty clean, in fact, on this particular visit, The Garage is pretty clean in general. The first thing that grabs my attention, however, is the simplicity of the menu, and I don't mean that in a bad way. We can only be prejudiced by our own preferences, and for me, a burger is all about simplicity. In my last post I criticized The Biltmore for not pulling all of its culinary promises off, when in reality, had they, they could have had a much higher score, maybe an unbeatable one. I still don't know what my perfect burger will taste like, but for now, the West-Coast style, which is what Flat Patties serves up, seems to be more my style. I ordered a double cheeseburger, that came with lettuce, tomato, cheese and a house sauce, as well as a small order of onion rings. The food came in about 8 minutes, and they also have a self-serve topping bar at the counter. I have a love/hate feeling towards this, while I appreciate the offer, I want my burger to be prepared and topped for me, I understand that some people may want jalapenos or relish, but not me, please serve it to they way you intend for me to eat it. Upon first bite, I knew I loved it, the grilled brioche style bun was lovely, it had a nice crust and was a perfect fit with the meat, just the right amount of bread to meat ratio. And it was juicy, very juicy, unfortunately I couldn't taste the house sauce at all but I honestly didn't miss it too much. The beef was good, not great, could have been seasoned better and certainly not the quality of a John Dewar. The onion rings were solid, a bit greasy, but perfectly salty and delicious, if not a little on the skimpy side. ($2.25 for about ten very thin rings) I tasted a few fries, which were sub-par, somehow cold, even though they claim to fry to order, but there's no way fries get that cold that fast. A few things were curious to me though; 50 cent refills on the soda machine, a gumball machine from the late 80's and a gigantic tortilla press on the counter even though I couldn't detect a tortilla-like product on the menu whatsoever. Overall, the burgers were great, it ran in at about $11 per person, the service was fast and friendly and I left completely satisfied, I will definitely return."},{"name":"Revival","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Great food and home-style decor/ambiance.  This was great for a group of 8 as we all opted to do family style where you can choose your entree and dessert, and the chef will bring out the starters and trimmings.  We decided to order a few different entrees to try a few things out including the spicy catfish, fried chicken and short rib.  Definitely the fried chicken was the best - probably one of the best I've had - chicken was moist and juicy, and the skin was nicely fried and crisp, and flavorful.  I definitely could have had more!!  The deviled ham/egg tea sandwiches were yum along with the kale salad - the boiled dressing was delicious!  The roasted turnips were probably one of my favorite sides - you definitely get plenty of trimmings.  For the dessert, the chocolate cake and lemon icebox pie were my faves - the cake was extremely moist and not too sweet.All this for only about $45 a person!!  And that included tax, tip.

I just don't think its possible to make, but I tried it anyway just in case. It's probably an acquired taste, but I think I'll just stick to cheese in mine.They had some sort of chocolate coconut style pie as well. We got that to go and ate it while we watched a movie.

As we all know, not all burgers are created equal.  When I want a Whopper, I get a Whopper.  I know what I'm getting.  It tastes pretty good.  It's probably not that good for me.  When I want to splurge, I'll get a Kobe-beef burger, you know, when my companions are getting \\"the sea bass\\" or \\"the duck confit.\\"  I mean, I probably haven't done that more than I can count on one hand, but I'll do it.  They taste pretty darn good, too, in their own way.Enter Tasty Burger.  It's more an approach than a burger.  Retro-hip gas station.  Well-done and creative.  Take-out window.  Novel, and kind of an equalizing move on their part: At all hours, all manner of men, twenty- to fifty-somethings, construction workers, hospital folk, corporate types, ballpark crowds... line up for their burgers.  Conclusion: All dudes like burgers, doesn't matter who you are.  (I'm not saying that women *don't* go.  On the contrary, the dining-in crowd is your young and hip segment that expectedly digs the partly-retro, partly-half-poppy-grunge-minimalist ambience, Samuel Jackson wall graphic, pool table, open garage doors, etc.  I'm just saying that, objectively, looks to me that dudes like waiting at take-out windows for a burger.)The burger is not out of this world.  But it's above average.  Solid taste, minimally seasoned.  In this case, the toppings make the burger.  And topping options are a plenty.  The onion straws are nicely salty and light, although still a little greasy, but that doesn't stop me from ordering them.  I even tried a \\"shaft\\" the other day on the way to work.  It was so big that I ate half before work and the other half during my break.  Again, toppings make the shaft.  And, apparently, length does matter.Lastly: My gf has tried the veggie burger twice now.  (Oh, how I love that she indulges me.)  Sort of in a neutral tone, she says it tastes more \\"tofu-y\\" than any veggie burger she's had before.  The first time, it seemed to sort of fall apart on her.  The second, it stayed together to the point that she felt it was a different recipe.  That's what you get with homemade, I guess.Anyway, the Fenway has gotten another boost with a fun place that fills a gaping niche that no one realized was empty.

Not mindblowingly good either, but they've got a respectable Caesar salad and yummy cheesy fries, which are worth more like 3 stars than 2, but brunch was unforgivable. My friend and I ordered the waffles with fruit and the huevos rancheros to split yesterday morning. It was 11 am, the place was empty, and our waitress was a real creeper, but I won't elaborate in case she was just having an off day. After ordering, our food arrived alarmingly fast and looked a bit like it had been premade and reheated. The waffle was cold and soggy in the middle where they'd piled on the \\"fruit\\", which included grapes and some kind of undefined-berry gook with whipped cream. The rock hard butter it was delivered with was laughable since the waffle was just as cold, and the syrup came in a lidded plastic to-go cup. Weird. Then the eggs - oh the humanity! I could have imagined it, but I'd swear that the description said salsa, black beans, chorizo etc. Well, we got pinkish scrambled eggs with undercooked onion, pink chorizo, and plastic-y cheese, a to-go tub of sour cream, two tortillas, a side of ubiquitous bland potatoes, and two sad melon wedges. I ate a dollop of eggs with some potato and sour cream wrapped in half a tortilla and then gave up. I'd have begged for hot sauce (and some salsa, spices, green peppers and black beans for that matter) but Creepy seemed to have disappeared so I choked it down with water, my friend picked at the remaining pile of putrescence, and we paid and left.

I do like the spicy seafood bowl/pasta, just wish the prawns were deveined. And the garlic spaghetti is very yummy too,lots of garlic.

Not going to find BBQ beef ribs here but whatever...my stomach and spine were in conversation and I had to put an end to that.So the question is does 2 wrongs make a right?When we arrived there was a small crowd at the door, the place wasn't very packed and the hostess was seating people immediately. We decided to by pass that and go straight to the bar - plenty of seats there. We were immediately greeted and given menus.After seeing the prices, I knew that it would be a tough choice trying to find the best value for my $$.  First, I can't believe that burgers would be so pricey on University Blvd this close to UCF, however, I digress. While I'm contemplating I decided to order the drink of the day, an Arnold Palmer (with vodka).  A very good choice...it was $5 at happy hour but it was good so I'll let that go.Finally, after asking a few questions and being told that the mahi mahi was today's daily fresh catch, I decided on The Ocean.  So the ocean, on the menu, consists of mahi mahi on ciabatta bun with tarragon remoulade, caramelized lemon and Kennebec fries. And of course lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle. I ordered my mahi mahi beer battered and asked for the remoulade on the side.  I was informed that all of the sauces came on the side. cool.We didn't have to wait long for the orders to come and everything looked good. The sandwich is huge...I decided to go at it open-faced...take the top bun home for toast (:P). When asked if I wanted anything else, I said \\"yes, tartar sauce\\" and I was told that it was on my plate. (wrong #1) Yeah, there was sauce there but since I had no idea what tarragon remoulade looked like I didn't contest.  Later, my dining accomplice asked for more sauce and was asked if he want the tarragon remoulade or other sauce...guess what came to the table.  (I'm sure you got this).  So I asked the barista \\"if that's tarragon remoulade, why do I have this (holding up the sauce that was probably tartar but tasted more like mayo) instead of that?\\".  She politely told me that I said that I didn't want the tarragon remoulade so she gave me tartar sauce instead.  hmmm.  I explained that I had asked for it on the side, not that I didn't want it.  Any way, after tasting the sauce that my dining accomplice had, I was able to quickly tell her that it was okay and that she didn't have to bring me any.  I didn't like it.\\nSince I had her attention, I just had to say \\"I'm curious...if these are Kennebec fries...what do your skinny fries look like\\"? To which her reply was something to the effect of \\"oh those are the skinny fries so if you have them that means the kitchen was out of the others\\". (wrong #2). hmmm. She added something about not have a duck fat fryer that I didn't understand. About 5 minutes later, she came back with a serving of the Kennebec fries and apologized that the kitchen had sent the wrong fries in error.  (Don't laugh) I didn't like the Kennebec fries (too heavy) - I think that the skinny were much better.So what's the answer to the question?  My order came out with 2 errors but turns out that I like the inadvertent substitutes much better.  The jury is still out, so you tell me.Overall, although I think that it is overpriced for a college area, the place is very nice and the food was good.  There were a few kinks but I think that's normal this early on.

When you finally grab a table at this place you'll be greeted warmly and provided with a large batch of freshly fried chips and salsa.   Nearly all items on the menu are priced below what any reasonable restaurant would charge for the same amount of food.  I'm not sure how they do it, but I suspect they make money selling alcohol.   The service is normally extremely fast with entrees flying out of the kitchen 5-10 minutes after being ordered.  The sodas are served in gigantic plastic cups and refills are normally provided before you can even make it halfway through your drink. I've sampled quite a few dishes here, burgers, salads, enchiladas, fish tacos, steak, quesadillas, and fajitas, but I have to say the best entree at this place is the gulf seafood enchilada.  You get two soft flour tortillas filled with chunks of crawfish and shrimp and cheese which is baked and covered with a cajun spiced cheese sauce with chunks of crabmeat.  It also comes with a decent side of jumbalaya.

It doesn't matter what day you come here, there will be a line.  And its best to get their early as they have been known to run out of menu items before noon.  But its definitely worth the wait as they have THE best ribs in town.  So juicy and tender they simply fall right off the bone.  Service is great too as they are friendly and will offer samples of the brisket if you have trouble determining the level of fattiness you want.You can order by weight but I typically get a two meat plate which comes with a healthy portion of sausage, brisket, ribs, pulled pork, and turkey - select any two.  They will throw in 2 sides, select from potato salad, slaw, and beans (in a meat sauce).  And finally to round it out, some Mrs. Bairds sliced bread.  They also offer sandwiches which are on a bun not sliced bread.  The Tipsy Texan is one that should be attempted as it is pulled pork and sausage stacked up to stand about 8-9 inches.  Seating is limited but not a problem since you wait to order prior to sitting down as a table.  Also worth trying is the Key Lime pie/tart.  Be sure to eat it there or quickly as the crust tends to fall apart which will make consuming it a bit messy.They offer 3 different types of BBQ sauces.  No labels so its hard to determine what is what but I believe it just goes by the level of spiciness.   Time permitting (I usually spend 3 hours there - waiting and eating), this is my default BBQ place in Austin.  Plus it is in town unlike some other options.

I've been eating BBQ for a long time now, and have had all the regional variances.  Beef is my favorite, so there was no hesitation when I had the opportunity to move to Texas.  This Wednesday, I left work at 10:30 and got into line at Franklin BBQ.  It wasn't a bad wait at all--we stood in the ring of shade that wraps the building, the staff came out to offer some of us chairs and also went through the line with a clipboard to assess how much brisket they would have to dish out so they could predict when to put out the lamentable \\"SOLD OUT\\" sign.  Because we got there early, we were inside under the fans and AC within 30 minutes, and only had to wait about 10 minutes more to get to the counter.  The staff is courteous and knowledgable, efficient and talented at cutting meat.  The brisket comes out as a blackened log of joy, steaming from its two days in the slow cooker, wrapping saturated with the juices of heaven.  A brisket plate comes with two sides (coleslaw (purple and tart), potato salad (rich, creamy, with moisture), or beans (didn't try)).  You can also order by the pound.  I got brisket and turkey.  The turkey was smoky and moist, with a peppery, delicious rub.  But you're here for the brisket.  It falls to bits when you glance it with your fork.  The flavor of the rub permeates throughout--it has the perfect balance of softness and brisket texture.  They use high quality angus cuts for their brisket, and the flavor is without equal.  Brisket comes in two varieties, moist and lean.  What the heck, get the moist, its totally worth it.  I bought a pound to go and lets just say that the next couple meals are going to be a treat.  You will NOT be disappointed.  There is a new king of BBQ in Texas and his name is Franklin.

At the front, they have $3 coffee to sip on while you wait.THE FOOD: It was one of those rare times when the food was worth the wait. Everything was delicious (fried chicken, waffles, eggs benedict, etc.). I learned that grits aren't really my thing but the one with shrimp in it was a bit tastier. The hibiscus fruit punch sounded pretty, but as with all hibiscus drinks I've had in the past, it was mildly flavored and lightly sweeten.  SERVICE: Spectacular. The waiter was kind enough to give us a small plate of fruits to snack on while our food was being prepared. He was very thoughtful and offered to get rid of this wasp that would parade around our table, but each time he stopped by, the wasp went back to his hiding spot.PARKING: Street parking only.

We made a reservation on OpenTable for brunch for 3. My fiance and I arrived about 5 minutes early. We checked in with the hostess, and she asked where our third person was. Having just received a text from our friend, I knew she was running a bit late, but would be there within 15 minutes (so, no more than 10 minutes late). Let me say, too, that the dining area of the restaurant was completely empty. There were a few people sitting up front, and maybe a couple of people in the waiting area (though the place did fill up within 45 minutes).So we're now two-thirds present, and the hostess states that they have a full-party seating policy, and we cannot sit down until our third person arrives. We said okay, but sort of looked around as there didn't appear to be anywhere to sit in the waiting area. The hostess then says, well, if you would rather sit though, we can make an exception since you have a reservation, as long as your friend is close. I said, yes, she's within 15 minutes away, and we would prefer to sit and order drinks. The hostess then said well, we have a full-party seating policy... buuuut we could make an exception if you insist. We went round and round like this for a while, and this included grabbing another person and adding them to the back and forth mix. Frankly, we didn't really care what they decided. We just wanted the conversation to end. I would have said nevermind we'll just wait if there was a clear place to actually wait. It definitely started our experience off in a very odd way.She did eventually let us sit down, all the way in the back of the dining area, and after all the back and forth our friend was about 3 minutes behind us. Our server started out great, but then once the place got busy service tanked. We had to ask for any refills on the coffee, and my fiance ordered a coffee after we ate that he never received. Thankfully, the server noticed that he didn't deliver it when he brought the bill and quickly replaced the bill with the correct one, sans undelivered coffee. (I was already starting to wonder if we were going to have to have another really weird conversation, and thought it might be worth it just to pay for the coffee we never received if the server didn't catch it.)The food was, okay. Good, but not amazing. The caramel apple latte was good, though it is sweet (as you might imagine from the name). The highlight is the ambiance, though Newbury street is filled with adorable restaurants. There are so many great restaurants in the Boston and Providence area. So my feeling is that a place either needs to have amazing food, amazing prices, or amazing service to be worth a visit. On all three counts this place earned 3/5 stars.

It was good enough (better than KFC, though that's not saying much.)  Nice breading, a bit of spice (a tiny bit,) and flavorful, not-too-greasy meat.  The fish- very small pieces, bland, almost inedible.  The shrimp- mediocre.  Plenty of them, though; too many to finish.  The biscuit- awful.  The red beans and rice were the best portion of the meal; they weren't great but they were decent.  The sweet tea was about average; well, sweet tea is actually one of my favorite things so I'm inclined to rate even average as high, but this was just fair.

How bad can it be? Well, upon arriving, we stood in the very small entryway with about 10 other waiting customers. No one came to great us or even tell us it would be a 5-10-15-45 minute wait. We waited 45 minutes to be seated. There were only 3 waitresses and a very slow bartender working. No host, busboy or management to be seen.We finally get seated and it took 15 minutes to get a cocktail. We stopped our server to place our entire order because we were seeing where this was going. Appetizers came, shrimp was cold and rubbery and Carpaccio was bland. 40 minutes later the food came. I had the pasta special, which was pasta, chicken and sausage. I could tell it sat in the pass for a LONG time. It was hard, dried out and cold. My husband got the salmon which was way too fishy and cold. My friend ordered a veal shank and they brought him a pork chop and when he brought it to the servers attention, she took it to the back, came back out and said \\"the chef says this is veal\\" and my friend had to argue with her for 5 minutes until she brought out an actual veal shank.Getting cocktails was a real treat. Besides the long wait, we had to take our empty glasses to the bar for her to reuse, without washing and fill them up again. Seriously?We were supposed to get 2 desserts with the groupon, but they only had 1 chocolate cake left and we had to split that, but not before waiting 15 minutes for silverware to actually eat it. It was no lava cake, no oozey center, stale on the outside.We were at this \\"eatery\\" for a total of 3 hours.

Below are some things to note about the experience, food, cost, and fun.Timing: We read/heard that we needed to show up at 8AM to get a spot, but we slacked and got there at 8:45. We were probably 50th in line which was fine for us. The waiting game: Bring some lawn/camping chairs for a better wait. Part of the fun is waiting and talking to people in the line. This is Texas so everyone is very friendly and chatty. We had a real fun time. I also recommend bringing a cooler or bag of drinks since it does get hot out there. If you are one of the first 75-85 people you will be sitting in the shade while you wait which makes things much easier. A few employees do go up and down the line to offer drinks for sale and take orders to make things smoother.Opening: The doors open at 11AM, because we were 50th in line we still waited an hour before we got to the front of the line. This was the worst part of the experience, the anticipation makes it less fun because you know you are so close and you are no longer sitting in lawn chairs but standing and moving ever so slowly.The staff: The staff are all very friendly and very Texas (If you don't know what that means then you will when you arrive). They were extremely helpful and talkative. When I did finally order at the front of the line, the people behind the counter wanted to make sure I got my order right and answered any questions I had and took their time with me ignoring the fact that there was another hour's worth of people behind me. I really appreciated the friendlinessThe food: We ordered Brisket (5stars best I've ever had), pulled pork (3 stars just run of the mill good), and sausage link (5 stars, top 3 I've ever had). The brisket is cut beautifully and you have choice between fatty and lean meat. They cut it infront of you and is a beautiful site to behold and has a nice rich smokey flavor that is perfect. The meat melts in your mouth and I can't say enough about how good this brisket was. I'm not an official food critic so I lack for words to describe it, but wow, it lived up to the hypeThe sauce: They offer three different types of sauces. I only tried two, but both were outstanding. They added to the brisket's flavor and were just amazing. Personally, I believe the sauce matters almost as much as the meat itself. I'm a huge fan of Rudy's because the sauce there is unbeatable. Maybe the best I've ever had (rival with Dreamland BBQ in Alabama). Franklin's sauce is still top tier and not many steps behind Rudy's or Dreamland.Overall experience: Well worth the wait. It was a fun experience, the wait is as cool as the food, it feels like you are partaking of an american icon. I loved it. While I'll probably stick to Rudy's since its more convenient, I do see myself coming back occasionally to brave the 4 hour wait to enjoy the best brisket I've ever had."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I wasn't impressed, not sure why people like it.

It looked great, tons of pretty girls were here as well, (a friend got invited into a limo, but had to decline it was our other buddies night). It goes to note that we went on a Sunday and this place was still seriously bumpy on what seemed like a mostly dead street.

I found Matt's on Yelp. Perfect! It is on the way with over 1200 reviews and sounded great !To be fair most reviews review the ribs and chicken which we did not have time for. This is a review only for the pork sandwich, mac, and rum beans. We needed something quick and easy to eat.I had a restaurant and smoked my own pork too. You can use the best wood, your timing be right on, the pork comes outside perfect, BUT the sauce can enhance all the hard work or ruin it.We both thought that the sauce covered the flavor of the meat too much and all we tasted was the sauce and bun. I am sure we could of ordered with the sauce on the side. My friend will have to let me now more after she brings her husband.The Mac n cheese had good flavor but it was time for another batch since it was getting very dry. The rum beans were too tangy for us. Not sure if they use apple cider vinegar or what. I like apple cider vinegar, not so much in my beans I guess. On the otherhand my friend said her husband would of loved it. If I was staying longer I would try the chicken and the ribs. By the crowd it is a favorite. I would of loved to hear the band too.I do not know when they opened their doors for business because all the photos that I have seen of this little place depicts the space emasculate, clear and bright, sorry we did not experience that at all.

If you are lucky, you will get a server who is cheerful and attentive, but you might just as easily get the surly kid in the baseball hat who is too busy and important to get around to waiting on you until you have sat at your table for 10-15 minutes.

I went with the \\"biscuits\\" ($17), which was basically a reconstructed Eggs Benedict.  The food on my plate looked beautiful; it contained three small slightly sweet biscuits, three poached eggs and a crab / Florentine mixture draped across the poached eggs.  Although a little pricey compared to other places it was quite tasty.  I also tried a side of the grilled fruit ($6), cleverly served to resemble sushi pieces and consisting of watermelon, pineapple and cucumber, marinated in a chili oil sauce.  The spiced pieces of pineapple worked the best.  Others in our group enjoyed the French toast with Asian pear and candied pecans, and the fried chicken with maple ice cream in a waffle cone (even if it was a little awkward to eat).The brunch cocktail menu offered a nice selection of drinks, and although not listed they also offer mimosas.  It bothers me when places serve coffee in tiny cups that needed to be constantly refilled, but to the credit of their wait staff the refills were frequent.The interior is very open and the decor is uber cool.

It was very filling and delicious. Each element was present in taste and the pimento cheese is to die for. It's made so well.For the Pimento Cheese, they are using what taste like a pretty sharp quality cheddar cheese and for those that don't like mayo in pimento cheese I would guess they are using cream cheese which makes it so creamy and keeps it from being too gloppy. It has a very nice spice flavor to it. The biscuit is a beautiful piece of bakery. It's a little buttery and a little moist and a little but of that biscuit crumble to it as you bite down, without falling completely apart. Not to dense, just right. My husband's waffle came out like a big huge fluffy waffle cloud from heaven. We even sat and watched her make it. There is bacon in the waffle as well as a strip on top.

Ok, it wasn't really that busy, ordering barely took 2-3 minutes, and our order was out in about 5.My taste buds were seriously confused as to how this burger was cooked. This is super duper important to know, because sometimes you aren't craving the smoky goodness of charcoal, or the super greasiness of a flat iron grill, or simplicity of a gas grill. I have a horrible urge to call them right now and find out, because to be honest I am a bit confused. I couldn't smell anything outside the two times I walked by, so I'm thinking its not made on a charcoal grill. However, it has this smokey flavor that makes me think otherwise. I think the investigation is still open on this one.Besides flavor, a burger needs to have grease, lots of natural grease. Unfortunately, this is where I think things were a little wrong, and maybe it was our fault. We order well done, as we don't like medium. When we got the burger, the outside was somewhat charred and almost tasted burned. I'm not sure if it was the jalapeno cheese that had a super smoky flavor, or if it was the burger because it was semi burned. I will mention however, that the jalapeno cheese was a very cool addition, if the burger patty is made right, this place would easily be 5+ stars for having a great burger at a great price.You can't have burgers without fries, and Tasty Burger's fries single handedly saved them. When we received them they were piping hot and fresh, salted to perfection. In fact, if there is anything I'm craving from Tasty Burger, its their fries. Absolutely simple, amazing, and fresh.I think I've rambled on for long enough now. I will definitely be coming back, because I think there is a lot of promise here.

It was a combination Valentine's Day and 3rd anniversary dinner. The #1 you-have-to-try-this-restaurant in Portland seemed like a natural choice. After a glance at the 4-star rating on Yelp, I believed the hype, and I reserved a table, making note of our special occasions. We looked forward to the meal all week.Everything started off fine. The ma√Ætre'd mentioned our special occasions, as did the hostess, and the print-out menus said \\"HAPPY VALENTINES DAY/3RD ANNIVERSARY\\" at the top. Our names weren't there. I hope they didn't print these for everybody.Things turned weird when our server came. Tina and I immediately recognized side effects of medicinal inhalation: fumbled greetings, persistent amusement, inexplicable hand gestures, and hungry eyes. We expected this to be a good sign; it would behoove a waiter at a good restaurant to be hungry all the time. As we would learn, perhaps there are other reasons for a waiter to self-medicate.Fatefully, I ordered the \\"famous\\" dungeness crab and bay shrimp cakes, and Tina ordered the \\"Northwest salmon saut√©.\\" I considered the pecan crusted catfish, but I decided to go with a Jake's staple. \\"It's less risky,\\" I said. That may have been the best call of the evening.The crabcakes were fine. The menu described them as \\"fried golden brown, served with jalape√±o ginger aioli.\\" It didn't mention the under-boiled pile of string beans and shaved carrots or decent mashed potatoes, but those were acceptable. Whatever Fred Meyer bottle the sauce came in may have been labeled \\"jalape√±o ginger aioli,\\" but I couldn't really taste anything. Tina thought she sensed ginger. This dish cost $25.65 for three palatable crab cakes.The \\"Northwest salmon saut√©\\" was an atrocity. The menu prepared Tina for this:Northwest Salmon Saut√©\\nShiitake & Oyster Mushrooms, Sherry, Hazelnuts and Cream ..... 21.80What she got can be seen in the photo I've uploaded. It was a slop of variously-sized chunks of salmon so overcooked that one could not determine its quality, stuck in a muddy, caloric puddle of cream, out of which protruded irregular shards of mushroom, surrounding an unexpected mound of unseasoned white rice and garnished, inexplicably, with several raspberries.What if she'd been allergic to raspberries?Tina's dish was absolutely disgusting. She makes these adorably childlike facial expressions of her reactions when she eats. When something doesn't taste good, you half expect her to just spit it back out. The second I saw that face, I flew into a rage. I love her faces, and I love taking her out to dinner to watch her delight in an excellent meal. In that one flash across her face, Jake's \\"Famous\\" Crawfish had ruined our Valentine's Day and our third anniversary simultaneously.I chose Jake's \\"Famous\\" Crawfish because I am a Southern boy, and Tina has never had crawfish before. There were no crawfish on the menu.\\"It's like wedding food,\\" Tina said, dropping her fork next to the \\"Northwest salmon saut√©\\" for the last time.She politely but honestly sent back her food, agreeing to an appetizer-sized plate of the crabcakes. She managed one, but she was too full of unnecessarily heavy Jake's fare to finish her second.\\"You really don't want another bite?\\", she asked.\\"No. I had three of them,\\" I replied, my voice muffled by cream sauce.\\"I feel bad for you,\\" she muttered, frowning.Our waiter was awkward before, but after he found out we hated dinner, it became a thousand times more uncomfortable. He offered us some complimentary cheesecake. \\"I hope that's good, at least,\\" I said. Tina replied, \\"I don't care anymore. I'm just trying to steal their resources.\\"The cheesecake was good. After loading up on that (one slice was enough), we lolled about in a cream-induced torpor, criticizing the art on the walls until the check came.This is the taste of a 20th century restaurant in decline. Food has no excuse to be this slimy, bland, and expensive. Jake's \\"Famous\\" Seafood, once independent, now owned by schlock-food chain McCormick & Schmick's, must survive entirely on tourism, hype, and price-gouging. It's time for this restaurant to move out of the way. At least now, when we find ourselves in conversations about Portland and are inevitably asked, \\"Oooh, have you been to Jake's 'Famous' Crawfish?\\", we will be able to say \\"Yes. It was awful.\\"As in other reviews, the silver lining was our goofily-smiling waiter, who seemed to have girded his mindset against this sort of thing. He struck the offending meal from the bill, and brought a second plate of crab cakes for free, with a slice of cheesecake. He was rewarded handsomely.That morning, Tina made dill-seasoned scrambled eggs with cheddar and salami, baked beans, and toast. It was the best meal of the day by a wide margin, and the ingredients cost less than a glass of wine at dinner. I love her so much."},{"name":"Bambinelli's","address":"3202 Northlake Pkwy NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Always great dining at Bambinelli's.

I've been hunting for a decent ramen shop since moving from Honolulu, HI. I read the reviews of Tatsu-Ya and Michi and decided to try Tatsu-ya first.When I arrived at 11am on a 57 degree, rainy Wednesday there was no line outside and a few people inside. Good start, brownie point. I was greeted in less then 10 seconds, informed where to order, where to choose a seat, and given a numbered peg so the staff could find me when my order was ready. Another brownie point.Ordering was straight-forward--stand along the beverage bar to order with the cashier. Meanwhile the bartender asked what beverage I wanted. I ordered the Ol Skool ramen and only added the spicy bomb. The broth was light in terms of depth of flavor. It's a chicken based shoyu broth and it's supposed to be light so don't expect the complexity of other types like shio or tantan. Also, the consistency is a broth (this distinction because Michi ramen offers thicker choices) and I appreciated that Tatsu-Ya's standard is a broth.I did appreciate the temperature of the broth. It was hot; as in, burn the roof of my mouth/ make my nose run after slurping up a mouthful of noodles kind of hot. Just the way I like it and I requested that when ordering because luke-warm broth is a deal breaker for me. I suggest doing the same so as not to be disappointed as some others were in previous reviews.The spicy bomb was great. In terms of heat, it was mild (but then, I prefer Thai-hot spicy levels). It added a little more texture to the broth because of the dried chili flakes as well as a nice richness from the oil in the paste.The ajitama (shoyu-marinated egg) provided a nice accent to the entire bowl. It was mildly sweet with a light, shoyu flavor that cut through the normal saltiness of the broth and spicy bomb. The texture was spot on; firm, yet still possessing a fluffiness in the egg white and the yolk was barely done; perfect. I will order extra ajitama next time.The marinated bamboo shoots were fine. Not pungently-pickled. The rectangle of nori was fine; it would be cool if they decided to shred the nori and make it furikake style. The noodles were ok. I will admit to being unimpressed with this crucial element of ramen. A great ramen shop has great ramen noodles. These are decent and honestly reminded me of Sun Noodles, which I don't care for the texture. The noodles glide like kanten (agar) on the palate and it's not just chewy, it's almost springy. These noodles fills the stomach but has no depth of flavor on their own. The refrigerated Myojo brand, at most Asian markets, taste better.Still, nothing I experienced was a deal breaker at Tatsu-Ya and I would return there when there's no line."},{"name":"Saffron","address":"3616 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I grew up eating Indian food, so I'm a little picky about it, but everything was really tasty!

I like the vibe and energy of a busy place, but for the life of me I can't figure why anyone would want to wait an hour for a table somewhere else when you can get just as good, if not a better meal here without the wait.  It was nice to be able to snap up an outside table, too.  Not sure what else they can do to dress up this space--options are probably pretty limited, as it's in the ground floor of new condos, and it's small.

We didn't have a complicated order: 2 burgers and an order of mac & cheese for the little one. It took us about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get in and out. First of all, it was a late lunch - around 1:15, and half of the restaurant was empty. However, it took about 10-15 minutes for them to seat us. They seated several people in front of us who came in behind us. I assumed it was because we needed a high chair and asked to be seated outside, but there were about 5-6 tables empty on the patio and others were seated on the patio before us.Once we were seated, our waiter took our order without writing anything down. Tip for waiters: you won't impress me by doing this if you get things wrong. He brought my burger and my wife's, but not my child's mac and cheese or my side of ranch. I had to ask him after about 5 minutes where her mac was, and he pretended like it was coming right up. About 15 minutes later, he brought it out without a word of apology. My wife and I waited to eat with our daughter but after we had waited a while we just decided to feed her off our plates and from snacks in the diaper bag - so she wasn't even hungry when it showed up. Oh, and that ranch never came. When we were done, he asked if we wanted a box and we said yes, but it never came either. Once the check came, it was the wrong check, so we had to wait for the correct one. He then asked us again if we needed a box, which did finally show up. Also, we went thirsty more than once and had to flag him down for refills on our drinks. In all fairness, the food was ok. But there are about 100 restaurants in this city that I would eat at before going back to this place. Nothing special or unique.As for the location, about 80% of the restaurant overlooks the fountains, so it's fun to watch the kids play, but it's like eating at a public pool.

It also gave us a chance to check out City Walk as well. We originally would have had to wait for at least 30 minutes for a table, but instead we were lucky enough to have found enough seats next to each other at the bar. Our bartender, Randall, was amazing! He was probably the most friendly and attentive bartender I have come across through all my years sitting at a bar. He actually paid attention to what we were looking for in terms of food and drinks and even made conversation with his customers at the bar. I went with the High Class Hillbilly Roll which was something I have never imagined to even be possible. Everything on the menu was actually unique and had a modern, asian fusion twist to it. Our group ended up killing 2 bottles of their Ozeki Sake along with 1 Hakushika Sake. We all had a wonderful time here with no regrets.

This is definitely a \\"must do once\\" experience for me. My father in law absolutely insisted on the Franklin's trip while they were visiting. We arrived at 8:30am on Tuesday and ended up in line down the street and around the corner (probably 70+ people in front of us). Naturally, he was ashamed it took my pregnant self so long to roll out of bed and that we ended up so far back. He marched on up to the front and asked those folks how long they'd been waiting. 6:30AM. 6:30AM!!!!!! Big fat negative on my end. Maybe for the world's best cookie cake... or bloody mary.... but BBQ? Ugh. Apparently its a way of life around here.At around 9:45am, the \\"Line Manager\\" made her way through to ask everyone what they planned on ordering. I must admit, I was impressed by their methods of controlling the madness. They have it down to a science. When she arrived to our group, she warned us that she expected to be completely out of ribs, and would only have about 2lbs of brisket left, but plenty of turkey, sausage, pulled pork and the chopped beef. They estimated our eating time would be around 2:00pm.... (That's about a 5.5 hour wait for those of you counting). It was up to us whether we wanted to continue waiting in line. Two groups behind us were told that there would not be enough food to guarantee them any and they didn't recommend staying in line. We ended up eating around 1:30pm and they still had everything to choose from. We did get the last of the ribs. It cost us around $125 for 5 people to eat, but boy did we over order. We had leftovers for days. Again, I'm not a BBQ fan, but I will admit that the food was fantastic. The smoked turkey was my favorite. The potato salad was a little too pickle-y (and I love pickles). Cole slaw was pretty basic, but tasty. The beans were just beans. This place could care less about the sides... and I mean, they honestly shouldn't waste their time. Their meat was perfection. My father-in-law, the hard to please BBQ critic, was in absolute heaven. \\"Best he has ever had\\" and \\"totally worth the wait, but next time he is ordering a month ahead\\".  Long story short, it's a must do at least once if you have at least half a day to waste. BRING YOUR CHAIRS, BEER, FOOD, ENTERTAINMENT, AND GET THERE STUPID EARLY. This is a tailgating experience. (Side note: They will not serve you food if you are drunk by the time you get up there.) There is a lady that will walk up and down the line and sell beer after they open, but it was cash only when we went. There is a small food truck that served coffee in the parking lot as well. I didn't actually check it out, so I'm not sure if they had any other drinks or food/snack items."},{"name":"Lily's Sandwich","address":"10901 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great little spot.

I have been a fan of Aaron Franklin since watching Barbecue Pit Masters on TV A few years ago. So, while visiting San Antonio for my son-in-law's graduation from Air Force basic training, I decided to venture up to Austin and take in the full Franklin Barbecue experience. We left at 5:30 AM from San Antonio. The traffic going into Austin at 7 AM was crazy! Arrived at restaurant at 7:30 AM to find about a dozen people already in line. The first person in line had a sleeping bag and pillow and had arrived at 4:30 AM. So between 4:30 AM and 7:30 AM they were only 15 people that had arrived. It changed pretty rapidly thereafter... The line got really long, really fast. Waiting in line is part of the Franklin experience. People from all across the country chilling in lawn chairs that were stacked neatly under a set of stairs. Trust me, everyone there knew what to expect and no one was bothered by the more-than-3-hour wait. People were playing cards, reading, or standing and chatting. The staff was really friendly and understood the line is part of the overall experience. Everyone asked where we were from and seemed genuinely interested in our story. I had my adult daughter with me... We ordered a 1/2 lb of brisket, 1/2 lb of pulled pork, a 1/2 slab of ribs and a quarter pound of turkey. The brisket is definitely amazing, as is the pulled pork. The ribs were a little peppery for my taste... And I wasn't crazy about the turkey, but that's just personal preference. This place definitely lived up to my expectations, and then some.To top it all off, I was keeping an eye out for Aaron (Franklin) who I had heard was on site this particular day. I never saw him until we received our food. As we were bashing on the massive pile of meats, I looked up and he was standing at our table. He greeted us and asked if everything was OK. I shook his hand and told him how excited we were to be there. He thanked us for coming then disappeared again.It was hard for me to understand why some people were getting their food to go... The full experience for me meant eating at a picnic table overlooking those still waiting to get in. I even handed a slice a brisket down to a group just below us to help enhance their experience. They were surprised and very excited LOL.In short, I loved every minute of this experience!"},{"name":"Giraffas Brazilian Grill - International Drive","address":"5415 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Dined here after a girls day at the Home & Garden show, and it was incredible!

The store was very dirty, disorganized, with boxes and bags of candy sitting on the floor waiting to be put away.  There are no signs explaining the price of the candy so you have to play a guessing game.  I asked and they told me it was $15.00 a pound for candy.  This is more expensive than a pound of Coffee, Beef Filet, and many other items.  Not only that, however the candy was half melted, stuck together, and in poor condition.  The staff was unfriendly and thought nothing of trying to charge such out landish prices for candy.

You can choose to go with a vegan hotdog if you don't want meat, and you can switch out the poppyseed bun for a lettuce wrap or gluten-free bun.  The cocktail list features both alcoholic and non-alcoholic slushies, and you can opt for a spicy variation.Given its popularity, you can have a bit of a wait at DF's and unfortunately the place is tiny, so the waiting area has been relegated to the sidewalk outside.

The collard greens served on the side were a bit on the \\"this should not be sweet\\" side.The meatloaf sandwich was pretty good.  It was not hot enough, and the bread was not the best bread.

The meat was slightly dense, but it was flavorful nonetheless.I had really high expectations for the hatch mac and cheese, but it was definitely a slight disappointment.

The pea leaves were still crisp, bright green, and very delicately salted with a tiny bit of oil, so that the flavor of the leaves themselves came through.  The fish filet was similar -- fresh fish, prepared in such a way that the flavor of the fish comes through and is enhanced by the spices.  The Basil Chicken was so good that my mother-in-law tried to pry the recipe out of our server, and the dan dan noodles were yummy.

I was striking out left and right with finding a bakery who would accommodate this request without limiting my choices or charging me an arm and a leg!  I left a desperate sounding message on Sugar Street Bakery's voicemail on Wednesday night asking if they could help me.  The next morning, Whitney from the bakery called me back and told me that it would be no problem to accommodate this request.  She had my order of fresh cupcakes ready for me on Saturday morning, one day before the party.  The cupcakes were absolutely delicious, including the vegan and nut free ones.  The cupcakes were devoured by the boys at the party, but I was able to snag one to try for myself. It was perfection!  I was so impressed with Whitney's prompt and courteous customer service, as well as her amazing cupcakes.  I also felt that Sugar Street's prices were reasonable and the superior product that I received made it worth every penny that I spent!  I will definitely use this bakery again in the future! Highly recommend!"},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"I LOVED THIS PLACE.

Considering the number of other excellent barbecue choices within an hour's drive, this was a choice many might not even consider. We pulled up to Franklin Barbecue at 7:15 AM and were about 20 people deep in line. We met great people while waiting--some who came to this area from as far away as Oregon just for barbecue in this area. Around 8:30, a staffer came to determine how much barbecue we would be ordering and to work out where in the line the barbecue would run out. One hundred six briskets per day (plus pulled pork, turkey, sausage, and spare ribs) will only serve so many people! At some point, the staff cued up some honky tonk music, and we even had the opportunity to pay cash outside for some regional beers and merchandise. Everything kicked into high gear at 11 AM when they opened the doors. We waited about 15 minutes longer before getting to the counter where the smoked meats were expertly chopped right in front of us and weighed and served on butcher paper over a cafeteria tray. We paid (credit card) and were lucky enough to sit inside with AC. The brisket was the star of the show as far as our table was concerned! Great smoke ring, juicy and tender. It required no knife, and some of the little fat remaining after trimming was irresistible as it was buttery smooth and intensified the flavor! Sauce was unnecessary but was so good that I would have a taste every few bites. All the sides were delicious--I liked the pinto beans best, and I'm glad I saved a wee bit of room for a few bites of a 4\\" pecan pie. This, too, was notably tasty--not too sweet and with tender, flaky crust.  So, is Franklin Barbecue worth a 4-hour wait? We had such a great time in the social atmosphere that it seemed like only half that time. All of the barbecue is excellent, and the brisket is some of the best I've ever eaten. If you are one to put on a smile and enjoy the festivities, you will be rewarded by some of the best barbecue around!"},{"name":"Pizza Hut","address":"8255 Lee Vista Blvd, Ste B","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"April- Much better than the 1st and 2nd times we ordered from this Pizza Hut.

They tended to run on the spicy side, but handled it well, it never overwhelmed. By the third course I was getting full. By the end I was BURSTING. The third course was a bit too much food, but to their credit, so tasty, I couldn't stop eating. Masa only needs work on their deserts, a bit too plain and run of the mill for my taste. Masa has a nice wine list, some interesting cocktails and a many fine tequilas to compliment their spicy flavors. The service was fine--despite it being a very busy New Year's our waitress was gracious and helpful. If she forgot anything, she apologized and returned with the item quickly. Major props to her for keeping her cool under so much pressure. The food runners were gracious, but forgot who's plate was who's. Perhaps if I return on a non-event night they might have it more together, who knows.  The decor was cozy, a nice variety of seating was available--booths for smaller parties and tables for large parties.

My dining companions were so intent on enjoying their food, not a soul jumped up to help. So much for Damsel in Distress-that goes out the window when delicious 2am Chinese food is involved. Good thing I know the Heimlich. 2) While I am glad my life didn't end at Chau Chow, there are certainly worst places to die.

They sell items like Mast Brothers Chocolates and many people know the chocolates are encased in pretty packaging but when it comes to taste, they're overpriced, gritty, and sour.  That sort of sums up my \\"expensive sandwich\\" experience at Cured. And I have to let you know that this is not my first expensive sandwich. I've lived in Tokyo, NY, SF and LA. I've had many expensive sandwiches especially in SF. That place was like the mother of the expensive sandwiches. Anyway, my husband got a sandwich with chevre type of cheese with pears and something else which he said was too sweet. It was forgettable.  We can't even remember what was on the sandwich. I got a baguette with some soft cheese like a Ch√®vre or a fromage blanc with fig jam, prosciutto, and fig jam. What I got was a lovely baguette that was crispy, smeared with a ton of this cheese and fig jam. when I opened the sandwich there was a strip of the tiniest teeny strip of prosciutto and a few arugula leaves. Really guys? To be frank, my sandwich tasted like my breakfast of english muffin with cream cheese and jam. way too much fig jam and not enough salt.  The concept is great but in execution, they need to tone down on the jam and cheese and pretend it was like the mayo and focus on the meat and arugula. So I went up and got some pickled onions which helped balance out the flavors. Are you guys eating your sandwiches? Maybe someone should test them out first bc they can be a whole lot better with a few tweaks here and there. The two working behind the meat counter were very nice. Which leads me to the guy who worked up at the cash register. I've worked in public before so I hate to judge people because everyone is entitled to a bad day. But the big guy with the beard and tattoos manning the cash register. Oh man. I  truly hope you were having a bad day and I hope no one died but if you're that grumpy maybe it's a good day to not come to work and deal with the public. I asked two questions and each one was met with a big huff and a sigh. I asked him for some napkins which were stacked next to him with a weight, he didn't reply but only took the weight off the napkins in this huffy way and gave me a dirty look. After paying $9 each for a pretty small sandwich and a few bucks for drinks which brought us to $25 i just want a fake smile and maybe a \\"thanks!\\". That's all!

Everything sounded so good. Our food came out really fast and hot. My girlfriend and I ordered the BBQ platter for $30. On that you get 3 smoked meats of your choice and 2 sides. There was more than enough food for the 2 of us, and I have a hearty appetite. An excellent price for the amount of food perfect for 2 people to share. We chose the Pulled Pork, Ribs, & BBQ Chicken.  For our sides we chose Mac and Cheese and the Cornbread.  The meats tasted good and you have a choice of 4 sauces at your table to put on the meats. I thought the BBQ Chicken was ok not as good as the Pulled Pork.  The Ribs tasted good but did not have a lot of meat on the bones. I've had better ribs but still they were good. The Mac & Cheese was good I though but my girlfriend thought it was just ok. The cornbread tasted good and comes with a sweet honey butter to put on if you like. For desert we had the Peanut Butter Pie. It was so rich and with melted chocolate on top this can easily be shared by 2 people. Overall it was a good experience.  When you go, make sure to ask for Grayson as your server.

Tennessee has great bbq, but not Georgia. There are a few places that do it well enough, such as Little Barn in Lawrenceville, and Smokin Pig in Macon, but nothing that blew me away. I'd read the stellar reviews on Fox Bros so I decided to try it. Reading about the crowds, I went at 3pm on Monday to avoid having to wait. It worked, as the place was mostly empty. The parking lot is tiny, and I got the last spot, so I'd hate to see it when it's crowded.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, tater tots, and some Jalapeno corn bread. The food came quickly, which was a pleasant surprise. The portions were generous as to the huge sandwich, and massive amount of tots. On the flip, the jalapeno bread was a small piece which did not seem to me to be worth $2. I love tots, and must admit that the last time I had any was in my high school cafeteria, quite some years ago. I was looking forward to it. They were a bit too salty, but otherwise very good. Nice and crispy, without being mushy, or overdone. Unfortunately, the ketchup bottle at the table was slimy and sticky. Gross. I like to save the best for last, so I started with the tots. Almost a mistake b/c of the amount, which filled me up nicely. The corn bread was disappointing. It was dry and crumbly on the outside, and doughy on the inside, with not enough jalapeno flavor. Finally, on to the sandwich. It looked great. The ends were crispy, the inside was tender. Not too dry, not to wet, and a perfect amount of pickles. I couldn't wait for my first bite. I should have, as the first bite had me chomping down on a huge bone fragment. Fortunately, I caught it just right, and I was able to avoid chipping a tooth, or swallowing it. Thankfully that was the only problem. A niggle tho, is that they only have one sauce. At least they have it at the table, as some other places add it in the kitchen, which dictates the type and amount of sauce your bbq has on it.  However, I like thick, sweet sauce. Fox Bros' sauce is thin, runny, and sweet/spicy. It wasn't my fave, but it did the trick. The pork also seemed a bit salty, but it was still good. All in, it wasn't any better than other places I've been to, and definitely did not live up to the hype. It is not worth it to me to return, so my quest for great Georgia bbq continues."},{"name":"Cassis Bakery","address":"261 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"The best bakery in New England!!!!

The G&T was in a mason jar and had appropriate fiz which made me happy. Wine was ok, but there is a limited wine list.\\nFor dinner we started with the spicy pimento cheese which will be something I will crave in the future. It was creamy and spicy and I slathered it on their garlic toasts. For our entrees we had smoked kielbasa with spicy mac and  cheese and bbq beans, pulled chicken with cole slaw and corn bread, and half chicken with mac and cheese and bbq beans. The pulled chicken was the star smokey and moist in slightly sweet sauce, the kielbasa was good, but chicken was just slightly dry. The sides really shined, arriving in individual mini mason jars.

Yes that is how full I am from my dinner tonight.  Let me begin with the pre-warning, there is a line to get in. It went fast and was worth the wait. There were 4 of us in our party and I ate enough for 5. We started with their small dishes. 1. The slider. This had a flavor like nothing I've ever had. I'd describe it but I can't so just try it!! The edamame was tasty too. Had a little kick to it. The sweet and sour yoda was very good too. Yoda are the Brussel sprouts (not the little muppet from Star Wars...which is a good thing because he probably wouldn't taste very good). I've saved the best for last the goyza. These dumplings are delicious. Yes I admit it, I ordered a second! Next comes the ramen. I had the #1 the traditional and I got a boost if garlic. While mine was good, I tasted my friends dish, the me-not-so-hot it was much much tastier than mine. That's what I will get next time. There is a lot of food and they do have an option for a more noodles, but I don't think it is necessary. Now that I was sufficiently full, I thought dessert was in order, I mean seriously once you unbutton your pants you may as well just go for it. So I got the strawberry mochi. While this was standard mochi, my friend (who gets 5 stars for ordering all the right things) got the cocopicio, or the tapioca, this was really good. Like a rice pudding with a touch of coconut covered in strawberries. I'd say skip the mochi and go for this. So in summary I recommend: coming prepared for a line, get the goyza, me-so-not-hot and the cocopicio. Oh and the beer with the owl was good too (can't remember the name) but probably not twice as good as the others (but almost twice the price). Go forth and eat noodles Austin!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Husband and I arrived at 2 pm on Saturday just when everything was about to about to sell out.

Lamar and I was working on my tacos when he got there.  We sat there in the shade until about 10:50, then the 20 to 25 people in front of us were suddenly standing and returning borrowed lawn chairs, so we put ours back and then got in the line to move on up.  We were actually about 35 or 40 back, it turns out, I think.  We were near the stairs that most of the folks who went up to the bathroom used to get up there while we were all waiting.  We had a nice chat with some of the folks in line around us and fiinally got through the door around 11:30 or 11:35.  \\nKen & I each had 1/4 lb brisket (biggish moist slice, small lean slice), 1/4 lb turkey, and 1 sausage link.  I got us a large potato salad and Ken got us a 4\\" or so pecan pie.  I tired every meat with each of the two sauces I wanted:  the espresso-infused one, and the original BBQ sauce.  All of them work on each type of meat that we got (we opted out of ribs, beef & pork both).  I think the espresso worked best on the brisket and the original worked best on the turkey, as well as on the sausage.  We enjoyed a nice chat once we were inside, and I was one of the tons of people to take a photograph.  I also know we ended up in multiple people's videos and photographs, both of the line and of the interior.  We enjoyed all the graffiti and stickers once we got to start going up the stairs to the ramp to get in.  \\nHe had an Austin Beerworks IPA and I had an Urban something or other pinot noir in a 12 oz can.  It was a pretty good pinot an it was weird to drink out of that.  We each got a shirt; I got red and he got blue, which is cute since he's a Republican and I'm a dyed in the wool Socialist Democrat.\\nNow on to the meal itself.  The potato salad was delicious as well as super mustardy.  At one point, I had a dude in line behind us (he was over the wall from our table).ask how the potato salad was because his girlfriend (who I didn't see there) was interested in it and curious.  I told him it was tasty but mustardy, then when she got back he told her what I'd said and she looked to me and asked if I did like it.  I said yes, and that if she wanted to go grab a fork, she could take a taste test since we had a large potato salad for two.  She was shocked not realizing who she was dealing with; I'll give whatever I can to help anyone I can, whether they explicitly ask for help, I'll at least offer assistance. :)  Anyhow, on to the meat of the review:  the meat!\\nThe brisket is great and moist and pairs well with their espresso infused sauce, and it also works well with standard BBQ cause.  Even the little bit of lean that each of us had was great and moist and delicious.  I see why people come from all over the world to eat at this place.  Aaron Franklin is a master of BBQ.  Oh, and the turkey was the most moist, wonderfully seasoned turkey I've ever encountered,and the sausage was quite fine!  I preferred the standard sauce on the bird & pig.  I preferred the espresso bbq sauce on the beef and in the beef, pickle, onion, and 1 slice of bread sandwiches I made  It was all delicious, and I have half of my 1/4 lb of turkey in the fridge wrapped up and 3/4 of my sausage link.\\nThis place is worth the pilgrimage, you are totally cool to bring beer to drink in line, and the weather today was PERECT for sitting in the shade in comfort on a Sunday morning in slightly  cloudy weather; It was in the 60s to low 70s while we were in line then in there eating.  Ah, you also can bring your canine family members with you to the place.  And there is no smoking or vaping allowed in line.Great job, well done to Aaron Franklin, his Mrs., and the entire staff at Franklin BBQ!

Instead, I had shockingly light lobster hushpuppies and decadent crab enchiladas (not to mention kangaroo carpaccio nachos). How the heck did this happen? I blame/thank my waiter.He was spot on with his recommendations and even volunteered to make me a small appetizer sampler so I could try a few bites of everything I wanted without slipping into the loving embrace of a food coma. Not that I didn't come close, mind you. That's because the kitchen didn't skimp on the smoked crab in the $12 daily special. But they didn't stop there. My crispy-like-a-flauta enchiladas came paired with a nice melange of veggies, too. The cooked carrots were especially remarkable, as they made me love something I normally hate.So while Chef Love may find salads beneath him, he certainly knows his way around a garden (no wonder those carrots are a standalone appetizer).

Here I got the Beef Brisket plate with a side of Brisket Chili and Baked Beans.  The food came out much faster than expected, suspiciously so.  The brisket wasn't very warm and I felt compelled to eat it first before it got cold.  But the sides were nice and hot.  Like I said, the brisket was simply brisket--maybe I just didn't have bad brisket yet.  The chili and beans each had a certain spiciness to it that kind of overwhelmed the flavor, which is unfortunate because they had good flavor.  (I'm fairly sensitive to spiciness, so others may not mind.)Service was friendly.  Prices were typical.  I made the trip from Marietta because this place consistently topped Best Altanta BBQ lists, but there are plenty of closer ones that are just as good, as far as I can tell."},{"name":"No Mas!

This restaurant seems to know exactly what to do to please their customers and keep them coming back. I know some people that have been going to the Driftwood for decades, and still enjoy its food and charm. Its not just your average diner, its a part of Marblehead tradition. \\nThe seating area itself is small, but it does not deter from the experience. Even during busy times of day, the wait is short and bearable. Groups of up to 6 customers can be fit somewhat comfortably. \\nThe customer service is great, better than most restaurants I have been to. Recently, I ate at the Driftwood during the breakfast rush, but the waitress was polite, timely, and answered all of our questions even though it was extremely busy. She even gave us suggestions about what to order, not from a \\"script\\" but from her own opinion. Her advice made my experience more enjoyable. \\nOur food was warm and cooked properly. It takes time for the food to be served, but this is understandable, because there is always a large amount of customers that need to be served and the food is high quality. My pancakes were spectacular, and my companion's omelet was flavorful and filled with vegetables. I suggest the pancakes, eggs, and bacon. \\nPrices are reasonable as well. The prices are not low, but you pay for what you get: a well-made breakfast.\\nThere are a few cons, of course. The coffee is not the best, and the entrance lets in cold air during the winter whenever it opens. They only accept cash, which could be an issue for some, but if you come prepared with a jacket and a $20 bill or two there won't be a problem. \\nIf you are in the area and want to eat a great breakfast, try the Driftwood and you will not be disappointed."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I wasn't adventurous (or crazy enough) to try the Frito pie, but I did have some of the specials on the night I went in.We had a combo plate with the beef tenderloin, country-fried ribs and burnt ends. The burnt ends and fried ribs blew my mind. Insanely tender meat with a great flavor. I would definitely recommend both.Also- the collards. Jesus. These were the best I've had in Atlanta.

I went there on a Wednesday night at around 7pm and still had to wait in line for over an hour!  I think the wait would have been a little more tolerable if they offered us any alcoholic beverages (or at least water?) but it seemed like most of the people working there were preoccupied which makes sense I guess.  What made the wait even worse though was that the place was stuffy and I was sweating like crazy and I'm always the person who's cold so I can't magine how everyone else felt!So, we finally order and get our food and while it was good, it definitely was not worth the wait but I also am not the most patient person in the world so I am a little biased.Here are my thoughts:Gyoza - My husband and I always get Gyoza wherever we go but I have to say I didn't like the filling that much (it could have had more meat) and it was oilyMuchie Katsu Slider- This was pretty good but again not worth the hour long waitRamen (#1 and #2)- The broth was amazing but was kind of disappointed to see only one small piece of pork and half an egg and if I go again (which I probably won't) I will definitely add more meat.  They only give you a handful of noodles also.Curry Bowl - I wouldn't know because they never brought it out and it was too hard to flag one of them down so we just leftI think this is the new \\"it\\" place for now and curious to see if people are going to be willing to wait more than hour for a small mediocre bowl of ramen a couple of months down the road.

Nope - haven't seen a soul.  She ran down the waitress, who begrudgingly(!!) took our drink and appetizer order.

More delays and hemming and hawing (I did manage to secure a second drink but no more water) and our main order did appear.

At about 10 bucks for a bowl, I feel the food itself did not meet the hype. I found the food to be enjoyable and different from what I am used to, but it didn't blow me away.Be aware of their hours! They have non-traditional hours of operation with a 3 hour break in around 2-5 during the week.

Nearly half an hour later, mom mom said never mind and she wouldn't worry about it. This was devastating go me because it was supposed to be all about her.

And then all the food started rolling by on those carts that I love..We had ham sui gok (sweet deep fried yumminess pastry with savory meat filling), feng zhua (chicken feet), pie gwat (spareribs steamed with black bean sauce), luo bo gao (radish cake), wu gok (deep fried taro with meat filling), seen jook goon (pork wrapped in yummy tofu wrapper), beef chang fen, and dau fu fa (silky tofu dessert in a gingery syrup). It was all so good, and the food comes out so fast!A pleasant surprise in the pie gwat were these small cubes of cut-up taro. It provided a nice flavor/texture contrast with the salty black bean and the spareribs. The service here is kind of strange. We really wanted to end our meal with dau fu fa, and when we asked one of the servers, she said she'd look out for the cart for us and tell that cart person to come by our table. That never happened.

The red peppers were similarly delivered.  The overall metallic taste really destroyed what could have been a very nice pizza.  The crust texture was good, but the metal flavor just permeates everything.If what you're looking for is a hip place to be seen, this is it.

Having lived in Portland for a while this broke my heart that it was under my nose and I missed it.  Fortunately, for my mental sanity, the place opened about 6 months after I left.  This is my first time back since the Doener Kebab opened.  Having lived in Wuerzburg, DE; this place is authentic.  Yes, you can travel around Germany and have all sorts of differing doener experiences.  Some places use the big commercially made ground meat skewers.  Other places you will have different variations, as someone who ate his way around Germany, I can confirm that this place is legit.  They are making their own skewers with quality meat.  The traditional doener kebab was perfect, thinly sliced meat wrapped with some veggies in a freshly made pocket bread.  Yes, fries are extra but they are well worth it, some of the best fries I have ever had.  I don't like to compare the doener and the gyro because it just isn't the same.  Sure they are both meat, veggies, sauce and pocket bread.  The differences are many from the slice of the meat, the spices, the differing sauces.  Give this a try and I don't think you will be disappointed, just don't go in thinking that you are going to have a gyro, because you are not.Wanna complain about the price, sure it hurts a little bit to drop $10 for lunch but we just stuffed three people for $30, it doesn't seem out of the ordinary given the current economic situation.  Sure as hell beats jumping on a plane just to quench a craving that you have been having ever since the last time.A couple of things that I would like to put on my wish list for this place, a garlic yogurt sauce (they may already have it as I got the spicy) and some more veggie options.

So of course with our first trip to Austin, I had to see if Yelp could offer us a ramen destination, and what luck! Ramen Tatsu-Ya was right up there, and right down the road from our hotel! We went early to beat the crowds and because day-long sight-seeing really wore him out quickly. We were there just a few minutes after they opened for dinner, and already there were several parties seated. We ordered at the counter, then were directed to seats at the high tables up front with our order number. My husband quickly grabbed us glasses from the self serve water, and immediately our food arrived from the kitchen. He ordered the Tonkotsu Sho-Yu (Tonkotsu Original with special blend of soy sauce, chashu, ajitama egg, menma bamboo, crushed peppercorns, scallions and nori) with extra pork, and I ordered the Tonkotsu Original with additional garlic, nori, fried brussel sprouts, and a fire bomb. The broth was rich and delicious, clearly top notch homemade, but as a garlic and spicy fiend I was thrilled to freshly press a bunch of cloves in and turn my broth a nice pink from the chili paste. The noodles were thinner than expected, and although they had a good bite to them, my husband commented that, although this was seriously good ramen, it was not as good as his two favorites (in Montreal and Philadelphia). After a quick trip to the restroom (whose entire interior is covered in an AMAZINGLY AWESOME design), I returned to find him in a deep discussion about ramen with an Austin-born Japanese guy who sat next to us. Apparently, he goes around trying every ramen place he can find in every city/town he visits, and of the Austin joints Ramen Tatsu-Ya is his favorite, in particular because of the broth.

Let's keep this as easy on the eyes as possible.\\nPros:\\n!-Atmosphere-! When walking down Boylston St., the outside retro look of Tasty is quite eye catching and a gem among a pile of old New England brick foundation. The building practically draws you in just on sheer curiosity along at first glace.Upon entrance, the old garage turned restaurant gives a very open and airy industrial feel...combined with the colorful pop art, sit down bar, good music and casual college/working crowd is very trendy and suave.\\n!-Service-! The staff at Tasty has always been my reason for continued service and my loyalty when working with the company. Lem, Marina, Brent, Greg, Michelle, Cam, Miguel, Paul to name a few, are great personalities that that suit the atmosphere of Tasty well. Always a friendly, helpful, and hard working bunch of people who know how to treat their guests right. \\n!-Bar-! - 3 HD's with 3 different channels to suit your taste. A good selection of common & un-common brews, as well as a fair selection of local brews which taste great.\\n!-Food-! Original and creative daily specials, wide variety of topping combinations. From some various reviews I saw, people spent time complaining about the greasy pool the burgers and sides are left in...I found this enthralling and to be apart of the grilled burger experience...Burgers and Dogs are supposed to be messy and greasy. Ironically Enough, even though the place is \\"Tasty Burger\\", The burgers are my least favorite. The award here goes to their Dogs, Onion Rings and Shakes. If you want to leave with a full belly and a burp of satisfaction, order a 1/2 pound dog and strings. You won't be disappointed. Suggested favorites here include:Hubba Burger w/ Bacon\\nBlue Collar\\nChicken and Waffles Special\\nLettuce Wrap Turkey Burger\\nAll-The-Way Dog\\nChili Cheese Dog w/ Gauc\\n!-Convenience-! If you are going to a Red Sox game, DO NOT BUY FOOD AT THE GAME...take a little extra time, walk up to the Tasty Take-Out Window and order some food that is 2x cheaper. Tasty is conveniently right next to Fenway Park Gate D. With Tasty's fast service and fair prices, you can easily grab a full meal within 5-10 mins and be back at Yawkey way before you can say \\"That's a good Tasty Burger\\" \\nCONS:\\nThere has only been 2 things that have ever bothered me about Tasty.1. The normal hamburgers/cheeseburgers are bland and tasteless... The toppings are the only saving grace to the burger itself and can not stand alone.2. The fries are also bland and leave a weird after taste...almost cardboardy...\\nI have suggested Tasty to many of my friends, co-workers, and family.

Their menu is enormous and included desserts, American style food, breakfast and \\"goblets\\", which are huge margarita style glasses made to share and come in a variety of flavors (with alcohol). Dry ice is placed in the bottom of the glass giving it a bubbly and smokey appearance which was interesting. My group of 6 shared the mai tai goblet with individual straws which tasted great (very sweet) and was more than enough for everyone to have a decent amount to try. I ordered the double chocolate ice cream sandwich with coffee ice cream and it was enormous and very good. I wish that the servers or menu had some sort of indication as to the ridiculously large portion sizes because each of us at the table had gotten our own dessert and ended up being way too much food. Occasionally the speakers in the building would play extremely loud birthday music as the servers sang and brought out birthday desserts to their patrons (mostly children). Unfortunately, it detracts from the experience of others in the restaurant because you cannot even bear the person you are sitting next to for the couple minutes until the music is over. Overall, it was a good meet up spot with friends, however, I would not recommend it for a those seeking a quiet sit down experience for sweets. It is ideal for a younger crowd looking for a playful different atmosphere to celebrate and enjoy a sweet treat with friends or family (desserts are definitely sized to share).  Other than the food, our service was less than ideal because our food took 45 minutes to arrive and our server should have been more  attentive."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The BBQ lives up to the hype! I'm not even a huge fan of BBQ but I really enjoyed this meal. We went back and forth trying to decide if we should wait out the line. We decided just to go by and check out the line at 1:20ish on a Tuesday. We had just had some snacks so we weren't starving if we decided to wait in line. The line didn't look too long so we decided to hop in. Waited about an hour. Perfect. A cool thing, the meat cutter gave us a cut of the brisket meat while we waited in line.

No, I haven't tried the others but I've been to the future and I've heard myself saying, \\"this isn't as good as Franklin's\\". Part of the Franklin experience is the famous line out front before the place opens. We got there at 7:45am (opens at 11) and there was already a line forming of nearly 30 people - a line just long enough to have remaining chairs to borrow and take advantage of for our 3hr 15m wait. While you wait, there's plenty to do: get coffee next door at Legend, grab a cold beer from the employee walking up the line, buy a t-shirt or other Franklin souvenirs, groove to the bumpin' county music, or even make friends with those around you - they may come in handy because once you're in and meat has been achieved, the seating is scarce and it would be only natural to want to save space for each other.After taking in the phenomenal protein, check out the smokers where all the magic happens."},{"name":"Giraffas Brazilian Grill - International Drive","address":"5415 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"On my last day in universal I was looking for a place to grab dinner before heading home.

The time it took for the food to come was about the same time I sit in a drive thru at McDonald. This was a sure plus when your with hungry kids.

The filling is so savory with chunks of shrimp, crawfish and Monterey cheese melted inside. The sauce added makes it even more mouthwatering.Margaritas range from 6-9$ they are strong, never too sweet or have too much ice.It is a wait on the weekends, more so when you have a larger party, but it is worth waiting for.

The restaurant looked super busy (which can be either a good or bad sign), and we were worried that they wouldn't be able to seat us, but they were able to find an open table for us. Unlike many other brunch places in Boston, Masa's portions are actually very reasonable (perhaps slightly pricey for the size, but this was the first time I was able to comfortably finish my order). We ordered the Ultimate Breakfast Burrito (which was your standard breakfast burrito - nothing spectacular, just what you'd expect), and Tequila and Cilantro Cured Salmon (highly recommend - the salmon is uniquely flavored and nicely compliments the poblano quesadilla; this dish is also pre-cut so it's very easy to share). We even had enough room to grab the Caramelized Plantain Empanada as a light dessert. Each order has just one empanada, so its recommended for 1 person, but after having already eaten, a single order was the perfect size to share between two people. I would definitely come back just for the plantain empanada alone - the breading on the empanada was not too thick or crunchy, and the slightly sweet tint only added to the texture and wonderful taste of the plantain in the middle. Upon checking in, we were even able to use the 10% coupon! Although the coupon technically said dinner, the server still gave us the discount and was very professional about handling the entire scenario. She just looked at the conditions of the deal, went to confirm that she could accept it with her manager, and then brought us the check with the discount taken off already. Didn't have to hand my phone over to her or try to argue our case at all. In terms of quality/taste of food, there are definitely places I'd choose over Masa, but for a reasonably priced and sized meal, this is a great option."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"After all these years, I succumbed to the hype of Franklin Barbecue. I've had Frankin's before. It was at the Texas Monthly BBQ Festival a couple of years back and it was good. I thought to myself, \\"Well I've had Franklin's and I don't line up for a long time just to have BBQ.\\"Then my staycation came and I thought, \\"Okay let me line up and try Franklin. I have all the time.\\" The reason why I refused to go to Franklin's is because I didn't believe in lining up for BBQ and the risk of it being sold out. It would be a waste of time for me. But I was smart enough to wake up early and line up. You meet people when you are in line as I met this lovely couple from Houston. So eventually, I finally had BBQ. It's been a long time since I've had BBQ. I wasn't too disappointed with Franklin. I've had BBQ which was on equal footing as Franklin. I had the brisket and sausage with coleslaw and potato salad. The brisket I had was good. I think I had the lean part of the brisket and not the fatty portion of it. Potato salad had a hint of mustard. Coleslaw wasn't too watery. Since I'm a sucker for desert, I had the banana bourbon pie, which is an individual slice from Cake/Spoon.I ordered a lot for just one person. I actually had to take it home which the provide a paper roll and paper bag. Be prepared to share your space with others since it is a small dining area and there's limited seating on the patio.

The wine selection is very vast and a good glass of wine is inexpensive. After much debate, we settled on our entrees. I went with the spaghetti bolognese. The spaghetti was excellent, but the flavor of the bolognese fell flat. There tomatoes were cooked down but still chunky, which left the sauce lacking a solid base. The veal had no taste and the pancetta was absent. I once had the risotto from here years ago at the Boston location  and should have stayed with that. The other dishes were ok, but I didn't hear any compliments from those in my party. We finished with dessert (cheesecake, chocolate gelato, and sorbet) which was slightly satisfying. My wife's friend had a food allergy and that was handled with great care, which made my wife's friend feel well taken care of.

They had everything on the menu, it was good, and it wasn't too hard on the wallet.  Fast forward a buncha years, and they've re-opened.  Nothing has really changed, and alas, that's not a good thing.  Six of us go out for a Mother's Day Dinner.  We had a reservation, but the place wasn't all that busy.  Odd considering it's Mother's Day and most places are packed.  Anyway...The menu is straight-ahead American fare:  steaks, chicken, pastas, salads, burgers.  Nothing too fancy, nothing too spicy, and definitely nothing that wouldn't have been on the menu in 1986.  I opted for the \\"Land & Sea\\" special:  a 12 oz steak, choice of fish, served with 2 sides plus soup or salad.  I think it was $13.95 on the menu.  Seemed like a helluva deal.  I opted for the baked haddock, french fries, beets, and cup o' fish chowder.   A bargain by any other name. Everything arrived as it should, and nothing tasted bad.  But, alas, nothing tasted all that great either.  It's kind of a bummer when there's really nothing you can get even a little bit excited about.  My dad ordered the \\"Queen\\" cut prime rib, and got a HUGE piece of meat.  While generously portioned (enough that we all tried some and there was still some leftover), and even served on the bone, it still lacked that awesome, slow-roasted beefy flavor.  Service was polite, no complaints there.

My friend and I got there around noon and stood in line for about 15 minutes. Unfortunately, the ribs were gone by the time we got there, so we decided to order the briskett (my favorite) and the pulled pork. They piled a good amount of both briskett and pulled pork on one plate and we used the espresso sauce for the briskett. Not only was the meat incredibly juicy, the espresso sauce gave it even more edge with a slightly sweet taste that complimented the crispy charred edges of each bite. The pulled pork was also packed with flavor and tasted...I don't know how to put this in a better way but...so clean! It tasted fresh with nothing added. Delicious.

The swordfish special, with a side of various roasted seasonal vegetables, was also great.  When I went for the second time, the scallops, tomato soup (with homemade cheese-it topping), and bread bowl were great.  Dinner doesn't open until 6, but they let you sit at the bar or in the front, in lounge armchairs by a fire, and order drinks/bottomless coffee with small appetizers available until the dining room opens.

My chowder was good, but I've had much better. The fettuccine was marginal - the sauce was bland, and missed the creaminess and buttery flavor of a quality fettuccine sauce, and the scallops and shrimp were mushy and overcooked.

You know it's going to be one because it's at the City Walk. But if you're going to do the tourist thing you might as well go for something above the standard. Cowfish is above the tourist standard. They offer unique dishes that you won't get from a standard sushi restaurant. This is why they stand out. The menu is very large compared to other sushi restaurants but they make up for it with their \\"burgerooshi\\" list. They make burgers and other dishes into sushi rolls which, as disgusting as they may sound, actually taste like burgers.We ordered edamame as our appetizer after the waiter assured us our meal would take a while to come out because of it being made by scratch. Nice try. We were going to order it anyway but the meal still came out in around 20 minutes. No issues here. It's literally beans in a pod. They add a lot of salt to the top of it to give you some saltiness which tastes good. For the meal my fianc√©e had a veggie roll. Not a lot of options for her but you can't mess up vegetables. I had the American bacon double burgerooshi and the tropical storm roll. I can eat a lot of sushi but these rolls were 8-10 pieces and fairly large. I was embarrassed in not being able to finish it. The burgerooshi tasted just like a burger, almost too similar in that it was surreal. The tropical storm roll had a lot of food packed into it. Possibly my only complaint of it was that it was too big and was difficult to pick up with chop sticks without it falling apart. For our drinks we ordered the s'mores shake and the chocolate birthday cake shake. This is where Cowfish really shined. Served in mason jars, the shakes had bits and pieces of real marshmallow, graham cracker, and chocolate fudge in one and cake in the other. I considered giving them a 5 but the fact they do not offer half rolls for you to have multiple rolls was a negative for me. I like to have a variety when eating sushi and when you only offer large pieces in meal size numbers you make it difficult for people to try the rest of the menu. Or you could spend over $75 on two people like I did."},{"name":"Saigon Seafood","address":"270 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"3","text":"Long story short, a friend ordered catering here for his wife's surprised birthday party.

ANYWAY, the food is good so I will probably continue to patronize Condado even though I might have hearing loss by age 30. I love the create your own taco set up. Even my friends who don't love tacos/Mexican/Tex-Mex (honestly don't know why we are friends JK) like coming to Condado because they can order tacos exactly the way they want. You have to pay for chips and salsa, but I don't mind. I usually skip the salsa and get the queso. Happy hour in on point here. Half off all margaritas and $1 off tacos from 4-7 PM Monday-Friday. HH is only in the bar area so be aware of that. If you don't like your food because you suck at making your own taco, they have some regular menu item taco options as well. Overall, I'm impressed with the food and the price point (especially during happy hour). I will probably try the other location during my next visit because the downtown after work crowd is not for me. **Make sure you sign up for the rewards card if you plan on going here often.

Let's say this... Given all the quality entertainment that we have in Orlando, this leaves a lot to be desired.  However when you consider the cost and that you get dinner, maybe you can make and argument for the place.  First off, self parking is now $5 which I think is just a joke. For $5 they should valet my car. Yes I know that to park downtown its going to cost me more than that, but I'm not down town and they aren't maintaining a parking deck or even have someone to tell me where to park.Secondly, when you check in you are asked if you want chicken or beef with the options to upgrade to filet mignon or salmon.  When you get your tickets you are told to walk in and that you are in the green section.  We however had no idea where to go, could we go in? And there was no one to direct us where we needed to go.  When we asked the attendant just looked at us as he didn't know the answer either.  FInally, we found our way into the theater and our green section, but again no one to direct us and we had to ask some people \\"are these seats taken?\\"They tell you the show starts at 7.30pm but thats not really the case.  They serve a pathetic salad at 7.30pm and I had to ask for one lone tomato in the bowl.  The kid started to get ancy and kept asking when it would start which wasn't until 8.15ish I think.  (seemed like eternity).  My chicken was actually decent, oven baked and well seasoned, potatoes carrots and greenbeans all on the plate were decent enough.  Dessert was a poor excuse for apple pie and we didn't touch it after the first taste.So for the show.  The actors did the best they could with a poorly written story that was difficult to follow.  Pirates raid the Governor's Gala and you (the audience) were taken prisoner and are now crew rooting for your colored Pirate.  Of course there's a maiden in distress etc. and I won't spoil the ending in case you can't figure it out.  But the songs are weak... the acrobats are now passe' Cirque style that are not done not so well.  The fighting choreography and sound effects just aren't there.

They apparently are well known for having their 2 for 1 deal. But honestly, it's more like buying 2 for the price of 2, because what you get quantity wise is not worth the price if you didn't want the \\"free\\" one. Oh and importantly, you can mix and match so you can get two different dishes for the price of \\"one\\".With that being said, the food in my opinion is very delicious here. Depending on how big of an eater you are, 1 dish might fill you up to a comfortable level, but I probably could have finished both in one sitting.I don't remember exactly what I had, but it had penne on cream sauce. The cream sauce is to die for. I made sure I finished every last drop. The penne was not too hard or soft, so can't complain there either!Only downside is that the servers can probably be a bit attentive. There were 3 servers when I was there and the place isn't that big, but it was rather difficult to get a hold of one because they would either on their cell phone in the cash area or chatting amongst themselves.

I suggested it as a good spot for a quick, tasty dinner with my friend Joey on Monday. Then, Saturday, my boyfriend decided that it was one of the few places we really needed to go before I moved away from Columbus. So, I ingested an unprecedented FOUR hot dogs in the course of 6 days: a personal record.Can't say I'm too broken up about it. MAN, this place is good.Even apart from the food, I like the interior. It's small...really small, in fact. But it's also goofy, and funky, and cheerful: yellow paint, music-related art and memorabilia on the walls, and of course, a big, beautiful bar taking up about half the real estate in the room. Perfect place for a two-person meal (though I wouldn't recommend it for a date place, unless you're on date 20 or so; the eats can be crazy messy).Speaking of the eats: they're a standout in the Columbus dining scene. There's a high level of variety here, considering I had 2 hot dogs per each of 2 visits and maybe only covered a fifth of the pre-created selections (you can also build your own dog, but why would you want to?). My favorite was the Pittsburgh Princess: obviously a take on my newly-beloved Primanti Brothers, it's topped with a nice vinegary slaw and fries. The Chicago dog is also delicious; I think my eyes actually widened in happy surprise when I bit into one of those super-tangy sport peppers. As for something a little more original, I recommend the T-Dog (but only if you have, at least, a tolerance for spiciness). Sriracha-spiked mustard with roasted red peppers and bacon bits...it sounds a little odd, but sometimes that's a very good thing in food-world.My only real gripe with the food is that the buns tend to disintegrate on the bottom, so as you reach the end of your meal, you'll probably be trying to keep the dog from slipping out and leaving you with a piece of topping-stuffed bread.

Esp because they are well known not just in Atlanta but nation wide. They told us the wait was 1.5 hours but we chose to seat as soon as something comes up that we will take it instead of choosing between indoors or outdoors. It took actually a little less than what she told us. We sat outside but the tables outside is also basically the parking lot. So as you're waiting for a table, it can get rough because you're just watching people eat. Parking is very limited as well. So if you can't find parking at the lot, you're going to have to park around and walk a little bit. Because we had so much time waiting, we also knew right away down to the core of what we wanted. I ordered half rack of ribs with a side of chili mac and fried okra. I'm used to the Memphis style sauces so I personally don't like the Carolina styles in BBQ sauce. It's too sour for me. I mixed the mild and hot sauce and used a little bit every now and then. But I basically ate the ribs as is. The meat was so tender that they literally slide off the bones so that was perfect. The only thing I would say about ribs is that it needs more seasoning to it. The chili mac was okay. Not my favorite but the big game changer was the fried okras.. they are def a side dish that I believe any has to get. They were so perfect. I heard that they were known for their briskets being the best so my bf ordered briskets. They ask you for lean or fatty.. fatty of course. And chopped or sliced. Def get sliced. The brisket was def good! It's hard to choose between ribs and brisket.. I leave that up to you. [: he also got potato salad and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese I thought was whatever. The potato salad was good but it was more of a yellow mustard taste and it was strong. So if you're not a big mustard fan. Might want to choose something else. We also ordered the brisket and cream cheese empanadas and they were really good! It looked like a giant fried dumpling with goodies waiting on the inside.

The meat was perfect and the bun from the bakery next door was delicious.The Kiwi Burger: My husband thought the lamb was very salty, I was okay with the seasoning, but I thought it was very dry. The fried egg it was topped with was so overcooked that it was solid. If the egg had been properly cooked I think it would have helped quite a bit. Also, personally I thought the pickled beet was too think and overpowering, but I do realize that could be my own sensitivity to beets.The Fries: Oh the fries, I wanted to love them, they were lovely to look at and perfectly cooked. But the salt!!! After a few minutes of eating them my tongue hurt from the salt.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Lovely atmosphere... I sort of felt like I was in the restaurant of a swanky Mexican resort hotel.  I was wowed by the towering blown glass margarita pitcher -- more like a giant vase, and BTW not easy to pour from a seated position.  However, I was not wowed by the margaritas -- at $28 a pitcher, I expected to taste some tequila in there.  But the salsa is some of the best I've ever had... not spicy, very smoky.  The guac was a huge portion, but a little bland -- and way too many big chunks of onion for my taste.  Other reviewers characterize the food as a notch above the usual tex-mex... that was not my impression, but that's perhaps because all three in my party ordered from the more upscale \\"specialties\\" section of the menu.  I thought of it more as a notch below Nava, which is not a bad thing.  I had the camarones alambres -- six shrimp grilled on sugar cane over a masa cake (like polenta) with plantains and a sweet/spicy tamarind sauce.  It was really yummy.One issue we had was the waiter -- he was friendly and attentive, but didn't seem to speak English well.  There are VERY few vegetarian options on the menu (odd for a Mexican place) and no actual vegetarian entrees... you'd have to assemble something out of the side dishes and maybe a cheese enchilada.  But when we asked him if there were any vegetarian options, he started off by suggesting salads... which, he pointed out, could be had with beef or chicken.  He just started babbling about beef, chicken, fish, shrimp... so my friend who is trying to give up meat for Lent finally ordered the same shrimp dish as me and figured she'd be forgiven.  But I would expect more knowledgeable service and better English from a place this......surprisingly EXPENSIVE.  When the bill came, we were all a little stunned.  For a much better value, great food, and substantially better margaritas, I would stick with Cantina la Casita in East Atlanta.

Food: OISHI!!! I ordered a Tsukemen and it was so flavorful and savory. I ordered extra chashu to go with it too. The dipping sauce complimented the noodles excellently. The noodles itself was cooked to perfection; not too soggy or undone. The egg and the nori tasted good and had good placement in the bowl for visuals. Last but not least the chashu was more than I hoped for. It was tender, juicy, and cooked just right. I was not disappointed and left the place with an empty bowl. Customer service: The service was friendly, speedy, and thoughtful!  I went on new year's eve and was afraid it would be a long line, but thankfully the line only made it outside to the post office next door. The wait was no more than 20 minutes which was not bad. I loved that they had heated lamps next to the line to keep us warm. When allowed to enter the restaurant the seating did not take more than 10 minutes which was fine with me since I took into account the limited amount of space they had and the amount of people they served too. There really was no wait for the food to come to our table too which was amazing , hence the speedy service. Lastly, the highlight of my experience was when my server, before placing my food down on the table in front of me, asked me if I was left handed to make sure my bowls were placed correctly. I was surprised they would pick up on that little detail and ask because no one has ever done that for me. Appearance/culture: This restaurant looks modern, chic, and gives a twist to Asian style. The menu is easy to read, but could be less cluttered. The music is diverse and the interior design gives a fresh vibe as well."},{"name":"Pollo Bravo","address":"126 SW 2nd Ave, Ste 10","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place so much.

That's right - years.I first came here when it opened in late 2012 - waited like like 3 hours (and I was lucky for not waiting like 6), got in, it was cold outside, ate a bowl of SUPER SUPER salty ramen that was so greasy and heavy that I left at least 70% of the food. I walked away absolutely hating this place.Fast forward a year, I decided to come here for lunch. Broth was a lighter chicken broth. Food was boring and expensive. I still felt very meh about it.Insert a couple of times of being reluctantly dragged here by friends, waiting outside, and bemoaning my having to spend money on food I didn't care about. Why couldn't we just go to michi, where the wait is shorter?But then something changed. One day, maybe a couple of months ago, I had an amazing bowl of tonkatsu original ramen. It was perfect - salty but not overwhelming, RICH, beautiful layers of flavor. The pork was done to perfection. Noodles were substantial. I was in shock - was this a fluke? Was I just really hungry? Because this bowl of ramen blew everything else in Austin out of the water.I came here maybe two more times since then, fearing that one day it'll turn back to that mediocre ramen that I could not care less about. But it hasn't. I went two weeks ago and it was still that perfect ramen. I still haven't dared to get any other variation. What could possibly be better than that rich, perfect tonkatsu broth? (Plus the other variations tend to be saltier, which scares me).I've had ramen in Tokyo, Seoul, Houston, Shanghai, etc - this place is memorable despite all of that.The only thing is... the wait is terrible, and this is partially because the servers are not very smart about placing people. They don't plan ahead and kind of just stick people in the next open space. To avoid mess, bring small parties and come early. Also, one of my biggest pet peeves, they snatch away your bowl the moment you put your chopsticks down. When they do that, I feel rushed, and then annoyed. Come on, how long does it even take to gulp down a bowl of ramen anyway? Let me be. I'll give that star back once service gets better. But if you're someone who's never been, you need to try this place NOW.\\nTLDR: 5 star tonkotsu original. service is meh. wait is bad but worth."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident .

Not the best BBQ I have ever had, but solid overall and no complaints about the meat.  The ribs and brisket are great, fried chicken is standard, and catfish is done right.  I always think the easiest way to judge BBQ is through their fried fish - the catfish here is moist with a delicate breading, not at all the hard deep fry breading that crappy places use (fish needs to be breaded differently).  I should say that what I get most often is the sliced brisket sandwich - very delicious, competes with the best of the sliced brisket around.  I recommend the sandwich instead of the platter.  From my experience the platter doesn't come with more meat than the sandwiches.  Also, the platters come with \\"texas toast,\\" which is basically cheap white bread at the bottom of the plate that gets very soggy and gross.  There is really no reason for this on the platters, there should be more meat instead.Another reason why I like this place is because I have used groupons (or equivilent) here before and unlike many other places they are actually very happy with the use of groupons.  It is ridiculous that many places issue groupons and then have an attitude when you use them - it is supposed to be advertising and getting people to try the food, yet many places discourage you from coming back by giving you attitude for using them.  Soul Fire does not do this - they are very friendly and happy to take them.  There was an article on one of the sites a while back (Boston.com maybe?) when groupons were in the early stages and the owner of Soul Fire talked about how great they were - and these statements are backed up when you use them here.  I very much appreciate this and for this reason alone I am inclined to continue using Soul Fire as my default BBQ place.Also, I have only had take-out from here and have never had a problem.  They generally give you a wait time of 15 min or so, and every time I have come in 15 min the food has been ready to go.  The staff here is also very friendly with the take out.  Some places care less about take-out patrons because of the out of sight, out of mind realty but not here - great staff (and owner - judging from the article I read he seems to care about the customers).Small complaint - I mentioned earlier that my favorite is the sliced brisket sandwich.  This stands true, but some pieces can be half fat,  although this is the nature of brisket.  When I make brisket I slice off the obvious huge pieces of fat and that is not done here, so you can get a brisket sandwich that has very large solid fat portions.  This is my personal preference though so this is not why I gave 4 stars insdead of 5, if they removed the fat there would be others complaining about it and that it ruined the flavor, etc.  Doesn't matter but heads up - can be a slight roll of the dice with the sliced brisket, but still what I recommend.So the reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 (they would easily have 5 stars aside from this).  They recently raised their prices (not a complaint, it happens and should be expected from time to time) but did not update the prices on their website (the sliced brisket sandwich went from $8 to $9).  What happened is that I ordered a lot of food and went to pick it up and came very close to not having enough money to cover it.  I understand price increases but you have to put your customers on notice by promptly updating your website - people rely on it.  Soul Fire would otherwise have a glowing review but not updating a website considering how easy it is is just not excusible.Overall - great food, great people, my place for BBQ."},{"name":"Papa Razzi Concord","address":"768 Elm St","city":"Concord","stars":"3.5","text":"We come here often as a family of four and on occasion as a much larger group (8-12).  What we like best about this place is consistency and quality.  The food is reliably quite good -- pastas entrees, meat entrees and the kids meals are always good.  Salads vary from great to okay and are easily large enough to share between two people (we like the panzanella salad the best).  And we must talk about the bread - thin crunchy bread sticks and warm foccacia - really great. Only downside is that service can vary from what you expect for a 4/5 star Yelp restaurant to something ... less.  On the off nights, it can be slow and the food can sometimes come out haphazardly. Taking of orders, delivering of drinks can be slow.  But, we only see this about 1 in 6 visits.

Originally, we had wanted to come for dinner, but it's only open until 2-3 which is whenever they run out of food. Upon arriving at 10:00 am, there was already a line down the ramp outside of the restaurant around the side of the building. There were people seated in chairs, I guess that there were here for a while already (as of note they do have outdoor chairs that previous customers left behind stores outside so feel free to grab one while you wait) when we arrived. One of the employees was walking around asking for orders (not taking them) due to the limited quantity of their menu items, she told us that we would approximately be in ordering food at around 12:00 pm, our actual time was 12:30 pm so that was close enough. \\n   Our order consisted of brisket, ribs, slaw, potato salad, and bourbon banana pie (I couldn't resist that one) all served on a butcher paper (no plates here people). They did have other pies there, that are brought in daily from a local place. Their prices are by the pound, but you can order 1/4 pound, 1/2 pound, 3/4 of a pound or more depending on your party or how much you want to take home. Your order is cut in front of you and you can have it lean or with fat, we did a combination both just to taste.\\n   The brisket was flavorful and cooked perfectly. I didn't eat the ribs as I do not eat pork, but everyone who tried it raved about it and wished that they had more room in their stomach for more. The crispness of the slaw and the creaminess of the potato salad was a good compliment to the hot smokey barbecue flavor of the various meats. The banana bourbon pie was fantastic.

I was slightly underwhelmed, but as usual, this has more to do with expectations than delivery. I left with some tasty meat snacks, and will definitely return to check out their cheese selection.Entering the door, I was a little confused. It appears that the shop is split in half, with one side being a cafe and the other being a retail shop. Not really a problem, I just wasn't sure if I was walking into a store or restaurant (it was my first time). I looked at the cheese, but since I was already well-stocked I was in the market for some pork. The salamis were laid out on a counter with names and descriptions. Above the counter was a large black board, empty, but eager for content. Small critique, I would have liked to see prices. I wasn't too shocked when I received my slices all packaged up, but I don't know what I would have done if I ordered some unknowingly expensive delicacy. Additionally, there was a luscious looking Iberico ham sitting in its holder. If I had an idea of price, I probably would have bought some (and asking is just gauche). After selecting my salamis based on description I noticed that the ones I chose were actually selections I have had before from Whole Foods or other decently stocked super markets. Next trip, I'm make sure to try the more obscure offerings (one of theirs is specially made for them... wish I noticed that before I told the guy what I wanted).The guy slicing the salami had a professional touch, not too thick, not too think, and everything tasted wonderful. I stopped by the cold case on the way out and noticed a selection of Hudson Valley products. Can't pass up some duck rillettes. A baguette later, and I was off to a nice picnic.

They said they'd text me when our table was ready, and it actually only took 30 mins for them to do so. The interior was really fun, as a very modern and quirky American & Japanese fusion vibe. There's a painting of a sumo wrestler with Elvis' face on the way to the bathroom, if you can catch it!The waitress recommended the Hillbilly roll and the What's Shakin, and we got the calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was amazing with sweet and sour chili sauce. The Hillybilly roll was pulled pork and slaw in sushi roll form. My boyfriend liked it but it was super filling, he could barely finish it. I tried some, and since BBQ is a hit or miss for me, I thought it was too weird of a taste for me in sushi form. The What's Shakin is basically raw red tuna with jalepeno, salsa, lettuce and bacon in two \\"buns\\" of sushi rice and imitation crab. It sounds great in theory but eating it was super messy. It fell apart from the bun not being solid enough, and I ended up taking the lettuce out for being too bulky. It was also pretty dry, so I got spicy mayo on the side and that helped a ton. Overall a decent dish, just not sure if I'd order it again. Definitely very filling, I barely touched my bacon Parmesan truffle fries, which were so good! :( filling isn't a bad thing, just be prepared as usually I don't get as full as quickly at normal sushi restaurant. We also got beer and sake. Total bill was around $60 for 2.I'd come back here because of the ambiance and service, as well as curiosity to try something else on their burger - sushi fusion menu. However, if you're a die hard sushi fan, you may just wanna stick to their classic sushi options."},{"name":"New Garden Restaurant","address":"250 Chestnut St","city":"Needham","stars":"3","text":"We were invited here for a birthday party and all was pretty good except for something strange in the General Gau's Chicken because of the texture.

I love BBQ and I'm not afraid to travel for it. The best thing about this place is if you live in Austin, you no longer have to go further than 900 E 11th St to get the best BBQ anywhere. I judge BBQ places by their Brisket and this is the best brisket I have ever eaten. We had ribs, sausage, pulled pork, and turkey as well. All easily some of the best I can recall. The turkey was outstanding (whole turkey breast, not smoked deli meat turkey like most BBQ places). It was super moist, perfectly smoked, and the biggest surprise of the trip. All that being said, I didn't come here to eat turkey! I would say the Pulled Pork, though very good, did not stand out as insanely good like brisket did. Definitely worth a try though, but if you're like me and live in search of the perfect brisket, your search ends at 900 E. 11th. Now for the wait that everyone talks about.....it is real. We got there at 10 am (they open at 11) and were 30 people back in line. By the time the doors opened at 11, there were easily 100 people in line (it was a Saturday). it took us 40 minutes to get through the line and get seated. You gotta want it if you are going to eat here, but I'm telling you,it's worth all the trouble. There were several people that brought a few beers from home (yours truly included) to sip on while waiting. Didn't seem to be an issue so if that's your kind of thing, go for it. They do sell beer inside (Live Oak on tap and shiner and few others in cans). Can't tell you anything about the sides other than I consider them a complete waste of space when BBQ like they have is on the menu. Sauces were all good, though nothing really needed sauce. The Espresso sauce was awesome on the Brisket and the lighter red vinegar sauce was delicious on the sausage, ribs and pork. Lastly, a little note about Brisket: get the moist or fatty cut. The lean is fine, I'm sure, but if you are after the ethereal, perfect cut of brisket, get the fatty cut and plan for a nap after."},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"LOVE Apres Diem!

The chunks of beef are about 3 bites worth, the mashed potatoes are creamy yet still lumpy, and the sauce with the root vegetables, and onions was hearty and warming.

I thought the food was flavorful with decent size portion if you want to split a couple plates. Our dinner included the broccoli kale salad the charred cauliflower with coriander and raisins and the scallops with fennel. All these dishes were tasty - I was most surprised by the charred cauliflower which had a great crunch to balance the raisin coriander sweet sauce and definitely my favorite. The scallops were cooked nicely and loved the fennel flavor. This meal really complimented the salad which was bright fresh and light. To end our lovely meal we went for the dessert named fresh Twinkie - how can you resist the name ! It was not what I expected but it was still delicious. This dessert had a rice Krispy flavor with frosting in the inside that oozed out making a sweet ending to our meal. Our final drink of the night was a sparkling rose Malbec to complete our meal. Overall a great place but the menu is limited but prices comparable to other places in Boston. The speakeasy vibe is interesting and offers a dark vibe which I think is especially great for fall and winter on a cold night. Overall a good addition to the restaurant scene !"},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Everything we were expecting and more!

What to order: Kale Salad, the Secret Burger, Corn/ popped corn Pancakes - things we probably wouldn't order again but were still fun to try once - pork belly and the green tomatoes. We still have a lot of menu exploring to do. I got the feeling sitting there that we were one of the few people who were at Alden & Harlow's for the first time which speaks to the fact that people love this place and can't get enough of it.

But, I don't get anything wild or fancy, just meat, bun, and a lot of ketchup. I'm classy like that.  Bonus points for feeling like I was having a burger in a garage, in face I'm pretty sure this used to be an auto shop in a past life.  They make the most of their space and it's the true burger king of the street (not the burger king a block away).

They are in foodie and travel magazines and even the valet attendant at our downtown hotel knew where we were going for Sunday brunch just by telling him the street it's on. Burnside is a very big street mind you. My wife and I were given strict orders by a local friend to show up at least 15 minutes before they opened the doors at 9am. We showed up 20 minutes early, found relatively close street parking and made our way to the back of the line that had already wrapped around the block. We waited a total of 45 minutes before finally being seated...outside in the cold. This was no big deal as I was just excited to finally be seated and eat.The hostess and waitress weren't the friendliest, but hey, I came here to eat, not make friends. This has little effect on my review.I made sure to order their \\"Creole\\" Bloody Mary. It was very good. Super spicy and strong. Just the way I like my daily pre-9:30 cocktail. I am a big fan of chicken and waffles so I knew I was going to get this before even coming here. Once it arrived I was in shock at its enormity. It was beautiful. Three huge boneless breasts of juicy chicken meat stacked on top of each other lying like a sexy bitch on top of a buoyant sweet potato waffle. I couldn't eat it all but I really wanted to. My only complaints about the dish is the breading on the chicken tended to separate from the chicken itself rather easily which left myself with a mouthful of just chicken meat and no salty deep fried orgasm to lend a hand. The sweet potato waffle was also pretty bland. It just couldn't hold a candle to the chicken. However the homemade hot sauce and maple syrup helped with that. The texture of the waffle was rather nice as well.Overall this is a great place. I want to try everything on the menu. It's obvious why this place is packed but I can't see myself waiting in line again for breakfast.

With relatively high hopes for this hidden gem, I was eager to give this place a shot. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a restaurant that was as good as empty (surprising considering a Friday night). From the looks of it, Hansik should be a family owned restaurant and I'm always up for supporting local family operated businesses. The restaurant was well lit and had a very homie feel to it. We ended up ordering a dish of spicy rice cakes (the rice cakes could have been softer and less sauce would have been nice) and a plate of BBQ Pork (which was really good). Combined, we paid just under $25 (after taxes and tips). A few parties came in after 8pm so the restaurant wasn't completely deserted (yay!).I'd say Hansik is more 3.5 stars than 4 stars, but because they are a smaller business and word of mouth is absolutely critical to them, I think they deserve that extra half a star so people would give them a try."},{"name":"La Moule","address":"2500 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"As lovers of mussels and oysters, I knew this would be the perfect place to take my fiance for his birthday dinner, especially since it took the former spot of one of his all-time PDX favorites, Savoy.We were not disappointed!

The grilled cheese sandwich was tepid and congealed. The turkey club had unripe avocado and the sandwich itself was marginal. We would have ordered shakes, but after taking so long to get the food we didn't think it was worth the wait. Tuesday night we made a reservation, and hoped that just getting shakes on a less busy night would be an enjoyable experience. We ordered 1 mixed drink, two milkshakes, and a cream and berries. It took a half hour to get everything. The mixed drink, a chocolate cherry sour pop, looked nothing like the picture and tasted like a cheap mudslide. Our waiter was amazing. He was personable, competent, and the only thing about the experience that wasn't terrible. The two milk shakes were disappointing. One tasted like milk. Just plain milk. The other had a cakey flavor, but was also mostly bland. The cream and berries took a while to make it out, but when they did they were great. Unfortunately, for a place marketed on their $15 milk shakes, the fruit and cream shouldn't be the highlight of the meal.

I have never in my life seen french fries that were literally brown and limp, like a skinny flaccid penis, or like I said...an earthworm. It looked like Medusa's hair, ready to attack. It was an ungodly sight you guys. They must have been cooked in the dirtiest, oldest oil with the lowest smoke point achievable while still actually cooking the fries. The collard greens were just mediocre at best, kind of bitter, could use some salt. I mean, you really can't fuck up collard greens too badly so whatever. The ribs really made up for everything else being so lackluster and/or downright vile such as the fries lol. However, I must purnt out that my ribs are better, and if it didn't take over 2 hours to create such a masterpiece then I would stick to my own. The location was hard to find, I just kinda looked at it on the map and figured I could just go down Moreland and take a left onto Dekalb Ave. but apparently Moreland doesn't work like that lol. You like have to turn into a neighboorhood off of Moreland then take a left onto Dekalb from there.

First off, the place is tiny, dark and very loud but the open kitchen is really cool and it gets very busy so I'd suggest you come right around 5pm when they open to get a table.Now, the food...the Fundido is served in a stone pot just like in Mexico and comes bubbling to your table. On looks, smell and taste  it gets a 5/5 BUT when you factor in that it's $18 and only comes with 6 tortillas...plus another $4-$6 to add sausage or mushrooms it's feels like a massive rip off. We added mushrooms and without doing that the dish would have felt empty but as I said it was very good. We also had 2 tacos each and from what I remember when I had take out from here in the past the tacos were good but last night they were extremely disappointing. The Rajas con crema was so salty and bitter..it was basically uneatable, the Al pastor was pretty good though.

You may notice that it is typically almost empty. The food is so-so and the service is very slow.  At least at this location you are within walking distance of several places to eat. \\nHad two issues with our stay 1) we were put in an adjoining room with the door between and our neighbors were very loud and had friends over drinking.  Because of the shared door it was quite loud in our room well into the night.  2). Asked for a cab to the airport in the morning since we were leaving pretty early.  We went down about 30 minutes early and I double checked to see if the car had been called. It had been written on the wrong day so they had to call then.  We waited in the lobby for the car and quite some time had passed.  I finally went and asked how we would know when our car arrived.  They said the guy is already here we couldn't find you.

Brisket was boss, extremely tender, falls apart picking it up with a fork. Turkey was moist and flavorful, sausage reminded me a bit of chorizo with its flavor. Pork ribs were the weak link, oversalted and a bit dry...next time I'll opt for the pulled pork instead. Everything had a strong black pepper taste to it, which I dug but some of my friends didn't like so much. For me it probably loses out to Killen's in Houston, but YMMV.

The atmosphere feels very European and quaint.  We arrived at about 6 on a Friday and got seated right away.   The waitstaff was great- our waitress was attentive but never in our faces, and everything she recommended was fantastic.  The Sangria was very good, and I noticed they have an extensive wine list and variety of tequilas.  Before ordering they provide cornbread and plain bread with a variety of spreads- one of them was some kind of apple butter concoction and it was to die for.  Cornbread was also a nice addition to the run of the mill breadbasket that most other restaurants provide.\\n  I highly recommend the onion rings, which look like donuts.  They are so fantastic, probably the best onion rings I've ever had.   We also got the sashimi tuna roll, which was not so great but not terrible either.  I'd recommend a sushi place if that's what you're in the mood for- but it was a good college try.  For a main course I had monkfish which was very good.  It came in a sweetish-smokey sauce that had fresh mussels.  It was different in a good way.  Someone else at my table had the scallops which were perfectly cooked and very fresh.  I also got a taste of a barbecue chicken they had as a special with mashed potatoes- very good and the least expensive entree they had at $19.  The desert we got- the bread pudding- was forgettable.  I will say that by the end of the meal I was a little sick of the sweet/smokey theme which was prevalent in almost everything I tried.  Overall this is a fun place to go in the South End.  I will say it was a bit pricey-but I think that may have been all of the pitchers of Sangria we ordered.     So if you are planning on getting a full course meal and alcohol prepare to drop some guap.  Otherwise I highly recommend it and will probably go back once the smokey-sweet taste wears off."},{"name":"The French Table Bistro","address":"3916 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been here twice now - the most recent being last night. We made reservations, arrived and were promptly seated. The server was friendly enough, we made our selections and off he disappeared. \\nHe then returned with one plate - because me and my mom were going to share the Nicoise salad she had ordered as a starter. The plate came out, but not the salad.Another server brought out some bread - but with no butter. I had to ask for them to bring some butter, and the server didn't seem too happy that I did. There weren't any plates for the bread either - usually you have a small side dish to place it on so that not everyone is holding their pieces without being able to put them down. Finally after what seemed like a long gap between the sharing plate coming out, the Nicoise salad arrived. It was good - not amazing, but good.Our dishes followed suit with a reasonable wait time. All 3 of us agreed that our dishes were too salty - that's the french, c'est la vie. What annoyed me was that our server never once came to ask how the meal was (I think he was miffed that I asked for butter with my bread - shock/horror). I barely ate any of mine, it was so salty - and the server took it away without asking if anything was wrong (usually when you see someone hasn't eaten half their meal, you inquire as to why). We asked to have it packed up - but they never returned with the doggie bag.When it was time for dessert, my mom ordered the creme brulee and my boyfriend ordered a coffee. The creme brulee came out - the coffee did not. It never arrived, and by the time we managed to flag down the waiter (who again, didn't come to check on the dessert) for the bill, he didn't want to have a coffee while we waited.The bill arrived - with the coffee on it. The waiter again seemed annoyed when my boyfriend pointed out that his coffee didn't arrive, and that he didn't want it now. It was also apparent that my doggie bag was never going to arrive either.So that experience was pretty blah.The first time I went, we had the same server - and he was definitely much friendlier if memory servers. What I remember thinking both times was that their menu was quite limited - there weren't a lot of options, and since I don't eat pork, I struggled since most things had bacon or sausage in them.\\nWhat really made me angry about this place is that my mom had a coupon for it, from the Entertainment book. It's a buy 1 dinner entree, get the 2nd free, But if you read the fine print on the coupon, it says it's only valid for orders placed before 5:30 pm, and it isn't valid for lunch. WHO HAS DINNER AT 5:30PM? If you're going to give a coupon, give an actual coupon, not something that no one will ever use for the sake of being able to say you gave a coupon.

I come in and get seated receive a menu and began looking over the huge menu. As I am reading it my server come and greats me and informs me that everything with a star next to it they are out of and also they are out of there signature goblet.... Well ok then so I look over it and go straight to the entr√©es notice fried chicken and Mac and cheese  for $26 I'm like hmm this must be good so I order it and ask to add a side of mashed potatoes for $6. Then I proceed to order the ocean goblet. Like a review before me when I revived it there was like 3 gummy sharks but I'm like whatever that's not important at all and drank it. The drink was very very good the waitress said it was made with hypnotic so I figured this large bowl should do some damage to me.... Absolutely not drank the whole bowl and not even a buzz. While I have my drink I'm surprised with my side of mashed potatoes by its self.... I'm like ok I've never received a side before my main course before. So my waitress come over and see that and goes to find out what happen. Apparently when they put that dish in it does not show up in the kitchen system.... Strange ok whatever they are working the bugs out no problem so she takes the mashed potatoes back 5 mins later I get my food minus the Mac and cheese. I asked where that was and she replied \\" I don't know you wanted both if you want I can put it in and have them make it\\" it's a honest mistake I understand so replayed no it's ok don't worry about it so she leaves. I eat some of the mashed potatoes and they were at best bland I've had insta mix mashed potatoes that had more flavor then that. Then I proceed to the chicken.... I pick up a leg and take a bite something didn't taste right so I touched the meat and it was ice cold but the skin was crispy fried. I immediately flagged down my waitress and told her. She grabbed it and took it to the back. Then the Maniger came over and apologize about it. I'm very chill and understanding and I said it's ok it's not a issue and he will bring the food back to me as soon as it's done. Mind you there maybe 8 or 12 ppl in the place so there was no dinner rush they had enough time to get it right the first time. So my food finally comes out and the Maniger replay \\"I ever brought you that side of Mac and cheese\\" ok thank you I appreciate that.... So I eat the chicken this time it's cooked but no seasoning bland also... I mean kfc has better season chicken then this.... And the Mac and cheese was ok. So I have a couple of more bites and ask for the check. The check comes back and it's everything in its entirety about $60 now I have no problem paying that but for what I went through the least they could have done was discount my ticket or atleast take the side I had asked for the first time and not got off... Nope I did not get anything so I paid the bill and still left 18% for the tip. I expected way more this place for the fact it's a high end venue with locations in Miami Vegas and California. Also might I add the music was being played off someone phone I'm guessing because twice while I was there the music stopped as if they got a text message. I seen a server run over there and the the music came back on. Again like I said if this was a mom and pops place it would be understandable but not from a high end franchise like this. $26 for bland chicken and ok Mac and cheese that I felt was a $16 plate at best.

Finally, we, as well as my sis and her husband, and our friends made a group reservation last night for a Valentines Day celebration. Nappi's more than lived up to my sister's rave review. We had a wonderful dining experience. Where to begin? We started with three appetizers: Shrimp Joey (which sis recommended), mussels in white wine, and stuffed mushrooms. All three apps were big hits with the table: each had its own abundant flavor, and were delectable. The Shrimp Joey was prepared in a chunky tomato-based sauce with basil and garlic, simple ingredients, tons of flavor! The mussels were fresh, exceptionally flavorful, and plentiful for our group of six. Each appetizer stood out on its own, but the stuffed mushrooms were prepared to perfection and possessed a beautiful balance of flavor (sweet and savory) and texture (firm, not mushy). Our entrees were equally as delicious, two of us had chicken marsala, two had puttanesca dishes, one veal saltimbocca and one fusilli bolognese. Speaking for myself, I had the chicken marsala, which is not something I order a lot because not every restaurant does it well, when it is made simply by the book and with little care, it is nothing special and kind of boring. To elicit delicate and balanced flavors is to make this dish shine. Nappi's chicken Marsala was amazing! So wonderfully flavorful. I heard raves from all in our party, and everybody seemed focused on flavor. Husband had the fusilli bolognese, cleaned his plate, and was still talking about it the next day. The chef at Nappi's knows what he is doing, and does it like a boss! We finished with espresso and dessert. I sampled the tiramisu, which was tasty, and capped an extraordinary meal. \\nThings you need to know about Nappi's: There is no set menu. They prepare every dish to order and pretty much, the sky's the limit on the choices. Nappi's is small and so reservations are a must. It is BYO, which is a nice option. We brought a variety of craft beers to have with appetizers, and a bottle of chianti to have with the entrees. All paired wonderfully with the food. It is a cash-only restaurant.\\nI am looking forward to returning!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Visiting Portland for Memorial Day weekend and this was our first stop.

I started off liking this place. My boyfriend is a big fan of BBQ so he dragged me here a bunch of times. Though I thought it was decent I would never suggest going here myself. Each visit seemed to get a little worse. The food seemed to get worse each time. The pork has no flavor and is gag-worthy. The chicken is ehh. The sides are all delicious--but I can't go here just to eat sides. The service is slow, and I have seen female bartenders cough and pick their nose (using their unwashed hands!!!) while pouring my beer. I couldn't even drink the beer I paid for, and was too polite to call them out. On a positive note, I do like the small but fairly unique beer selection. I overall do not get a clean vibe from this place.

After reading the reviews I felt this was a decent choice.  As I was visiting, it was a bit difficult to find and parking was a bit difficult as well.  I eventually found a lot a few blocks away. From the outside it looks like a very cool place -- there's an outdoor patio which was very crowded and lively and indoors was the same (it was trivia night so perhaps that was the reason for the crowd, but I was told ts usually crowded like this).  I was alone so I was able to find one of the very few seats left at the bar.  The inside is a bit dark, but has a good feel to it.  The bartender handed me to 2 menus -- 1 for food and 1 for drinks.  I immediately went to the drinks menu and saw the decent list of beers from all over the world.  I selected a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA.For an appetizer I had the Holman and Finch pretzel which is much larger than I anticipated and came with a spicy mustard and a cheese sauce -- both really good (I actually preferred the mustard, but both were good).  For dinner I had the buffalo chicken sandwich.  When it arrived, it was big and wasn't a pre-made type of chicken sandwich.  It looked like home-made buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbles (not the usual blue cheese dressing).  It was really good and very filling.  The roll was unique as well...not your typical store-bought type.  It came with fries and they were a bit soggy, but I still ate them.I would not suggest taking kids to this place as its a bit dark and was geared towards an adult crowd.  For example...2 of the trivia questions were...1) during which decade did Pam Anderson first pose nude in Playboy (turns out it was in the 80s) and 2) what girl's name is a nickname for the drug ecstasy?  I'll let you figure out that one, but not exactly the type of questions you want a 10 year old answering.As for beers - I had 3 different kinds, the dogfish head, a mother earth kolsch and the Cypress Street house brew which is made for them by Sweetwater.  The House Brew was my favorite and I would recommend it.I will definitely return to this place when I'm back in ATL.  I prefer these types of bars/taverns to clubby type/trendy type places.

Some waiters are very friendly and chatty while others are down right cold! But the food more than compensates for it. The fresh hot chips, salsa and guacamole are a good start. I almost always alternate between the camptown shrimp and blackened chicken. I've tried the blackened catfish which was good as was the eggplant royale.

Restaurant was relatively clean and service was actually friendly.We were immediately seated and both ordered Wonton Noodle Soup. It came out piping hot (always a good sign) and I was amazed at how crunchy, fresh, juicy and plump the wontons were. The wontons had big shrimp and bits of pork which made them plump. Okay, they weren't plump; they were on steroids. They were on steroids with translucent wrappers, which is not an easy feat. A lot of restaurants serve the wontons in opaque wrappers which aren't aesthetically pleasing and interferes with the texture, making it a gummy mess. Noodles had the \\"bite\\" that should be in every wonton noodle soup;  chewy, with a slight crunch to it.We also ordered Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli). Gai Lan was vivid green, had lots of leaves and most importantly - you could tell it was fresh because the stalks weren't ginormous which meant it wasn't cheap and old gai lan. It also had a nice crunch to it.

Start with your tortilla options, move on to meat, extras, salsas, cheeses, and sauces. Mr David and I started out with chips, guacamole, and salsa rojas. I was super impressed with the serving size of the guac and was surprised at the spice level; it definitely has a kick to it! Good thing I like it spicy, because I think some people could be put off by the spice. The rojas salsa was medium in spice and just a little smoky. The chips are incredible - thick and crispy with a delicious coarse salt. Luuuuuurved those chips. As far as tacos go, there are more tortilla choices than just your basic flour and corn - several of the other tortilla options come stuffed with queso, guac, chorizo, etc. Mr David tried the Peezler and JuJu and said he prefers the JuJu. I decided to stay basic and tried one flour and one corn.  The corn tacos here are served crispy, which I don't prefer, so I am more likely to recommend the flour version. Our waitress highly recommended the brisket and chorizo. HOLY TACOS THE CHORIZO! The chorizo was perfectly spicy and juicy and oh my gosh I could have eaten a bowl of nothing but chorizo, it was just that good! I was less than impressed with the brisket as it was very difficult to eat (read: not very tender). Everything else that you could possibly want to add to a taco is available here, but shout out to the cilantro aioli for making my life better (and please send me the recipe!!!). Try to sit outside on the patio as it is beautiful and fun. The staff here really has customer service down to a science. Everyone we encountered was excited to give recommendations and seemed happy we were there. From reading other Yelp reviews, it seems like a lot of Yelpers have mentioned the volume of the music being too loud. I was able to have a conversation without yelling and never had trouble hearing.

If you're wondering what to get, and you plan on waiting in line for hours, the easy answer is: try some of everything. Let me get into some specifics:Ribs: epicPulled pork: epicBrisket: epicSausages: not bad, but they don't benefit from that slow barbecue like the other meats do. The casing is a little tough for my taste. Sides: not bad. Tried them the first time I went but passed afterwards and made my own. Bourbon cream pie: pretty good. I'm spoiled by Tiny Pies. Crust was a nice consistency and the inside was pretty sweet with a nice mild flavor. Not too bourbon-y (flavor is quite subtle.)So is it worth the wait to get this meaty treat? For sure! Especially if you've never tried it before or you're visiting. I can't make it a weekly ritual to wait five hours for any meal, but on special occasions, yum. Tip: hire someone to stand in line and order for you. \\nTip: give the bones to your dog. They will love you!\\nTip: the meat is a little too spicy for small children. My 2 year old said they were all too spicy for her, even cutting in to the inside."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Two words: Onion Rings.

Out of its cavernous, underground setting, tucked away in Harvard Square, A&H delivers creative combinations and rich tastes by emulating tapas-style cuisine with modern American flavors. Surprisingly, the dishes are not small, like most tapas. They come beautifully prepared and presented, almost like entrees. The broccoli is crunchy, the smelts are fresh, and the pork belly is mouthwatering.  Each plate presents a plethora of strong flavors that are risky in theory, but disarmingly appetizing in practice. The bok choy dish is exemplary: crisped, baked, & slightly charred bok choy topped with walnuts and a soft poached egg. Strange until the first bite, when you realize that bok choy was born to be served like this.As for the atmosphere, it varies by where you sit. In certain areas, the cavern-like setting swallows you up in an off-putting darkness and secludes you from the outside world; in others -- near windows, open spaces, or lights -- the grotto effect is cool. Also, the waitstaff generally leaves you alone, barely interacting with you throughout the meal (ex. food runners, not servers, deliver food to the table). I guess they hope the food speaks for itself. And, by and large, it does. A&H changes the way you think about tapas; they don't have to be small dishes defined by one or two flavors. They can be hearty with a compelling character. This is Alden and Harlow's greatest offering to the world. It's worth a visit to taste it for yourself. Just ask for a seat by the window."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We ate at Alden & Harlow for brunch.  Not your usual breakfast fare.

Thought that was a nice touch~ The burger was everything that we had hoped for; juicy and plump with a touch of sweetness from the donuts that was enclosing the burger.  The sweet potato criss cross fries was not that great, however.  It was a bit dry so I would recommend choosing a different side.Been wanting to try a donut burger for a while, so I was extremely satisfied that we got to try and it surpassed my expectation =)  Burger itself was a showcase and adding the donut just cheery on top!  Would definitely come back again, only on those days when I had worked out and can justify eating a donut burger, however.Oh, small flaw, however... We kept getting bugged by, what it seems to be fruit flies?  We sat next to the bar, so maybe that explained it but it was a bit annoying."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Spacious, open-feeling restaurant, right on the edge of China Town.

Oatmeal cream pie is as good as all the reviewers say it is. I could start a list here of everything I tried, however, one no one would read this bc it would be excessively long and more importantly I would look like I lived there and ate nothing but sweets (which is only partially true)!I will say be adventurous and try the fruit pastries, the mini pies, and all things chocolate! Today I had the salty sailor cookie sandwich. I couldn't even make it home before I had completed the chocolate hazelnut with a little bit of salt heaven!The ladies there are always helpful if you have any questions or just kind of zone out at all the possibilities!If you love orange blossom, then you must have the orange blossom iced tea which can be sweetened or unsweetened. The only savory item I have ever had from there was a quiche and it was just as amazing as the sweets!

My wife had been to Foster Burger before and loved the food, so I wanted to give it a shot since we were going to be in the area on the way to a show.Only 3 stars because, as I said, we were on our way to a show and needed something semi-quick.  We got to the restaurant and sat down and had our order in by 5:48....so says our receipt.  We were hanging out for a while just enjoying a date night away from parenting and started getting antsy after about 20 minutes without food.  After seeing the majority of tables around us get seated after us and get their food before us, we got super antsy.  Unfortunately, our server Jaclyn didn't check in on us after initially dropping off our drinks.   The place didn't seem understaffed, so I wasn't sure why we never got a return visit just to check in.At 6:23 (so says the receipt) I walked up to our server and let her know that although we hadn't been served yet, I wanted to pay since we were going to have to eat and run to make it to where we needed to be by 7 pm.  I paid and she said our food would be right up.  About 5 minutes later with no food and I went to go tell her that we might just have to take off.  She had fries and slaw in hand and said that our burgers were up.  I hit the restroom and planned to get back to a table full of meaty goodness, yet I was disappointed to wait almost another 5 minutes for this burger euphoria.Needless to say, we were late and to top it off we never even received a simple 'I'm sorry'.  We obviously don't know if our ticket got lost in the kitchen or our food delivered to the wrong table.I don't expect people to be perfect (I sure am not), but the least you can do in this kind of situation is own up to somebody making a mistake.Again, GREAT food at Foster Burger from my only experience, but our service on this occasion left something to be desired."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"As soon as you walk in you can't help but notice the unique design of the place. Different level floors, wooden interior, clean modern yet homey Southern look. First off, the cornbread and biscuits are so good! The cornbread is on the sweeter side, delightfully moist and fluffy. The biscuit was also a scrumptious appetizer where the inside was moist and the outside was lightly crisp--you know it's good if you get a good bite and it ends up sticking in the top of your mouth. I barely used the whipped butter and apple cinnamon spread to enjoy these!The fried green tomatoes were a wonderful start to our meal. The green tomato had a perfect thickness where the unripe flavor didn't overpower the goat cheese, fried batter, and sauce around it and vice versa, and it gave a lovely thick satisfying bite and chew. The strips of basil added a nice complement. I really enjoyed them, like really enjoyed them.The butternut squash soup with apples and sage was a savory soup. It's a homey soup and goes down so smooth when you take a spoonful. It's therapeutic.I've heard many good things about the fried chicken so I had to get it. And I'll be happy to be yet another person to give it a two thumbs up. The meat of the chicken is juicy, savory, filled with brined flavor, and the breading is right on point as it is not too thick and hard, but not too light and gives it a wonderful additional flavor and crunch to the meat. The collard greens are good! They're not too sweet or juicy, but you can take a satisfying forkful and it goes so well with the chicken. One of my favorite collard greens to date. This dish holds a dear place in my heart.The shrimp and grits comes with chunks of ham and is smothered in a sauce which gives it a smokey flavor. Oh and the grits are good. They give you quite a bit of a serving so we ended up taking the entrees to go. The service was great from start to finish. You can't have good Southern food without Southern hospitality. The place is called South City Kitchen for a reason and they're one of the best I've had for southern foods!"},{"name":"Condado Tacos","address":"132 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Oh Ramsey, dear Sweet Lucy, how I love you!  Especially for takeout!  (When you factor in a wait and service the experience sometimes doesn't rise to 5 stars for me)  But bring it home and it's a winner.  The tacos are $4 each and without a margarita or tip, that's a pretty cheap dinner.  The truth is, the portions are so good that one taco could be a meal, but you really can't eat just one...that would be depriving you of some wonderful flavor combinations.In addition to the Ramsey (which I get with a Sweet Lucy shell), one of my favorites is the La Cha-Ka-La bowl.  I don't know what they do to those mushrooms but they are incredible, savory and tart from the marinade, smoky from the grill and with so much umami you don't want to stop eating them."},{"name":"Nappi's Restaurant","address":"370 Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant has NO MENU.  This is the reason I will never go back.There's lots of great things to say about this restaurant, even though I will never go back:They recently renovated and it is a real looking restaurant with a nice atmosphere.  From what I read, it used to be more of a grocery store or takeout place.  Not now; it's normal restaurant looking.  The food was good.  I loved the antipasto and like everyone says, the sausages were FAB.Now back to my b*tching:All of the good stuff is completely useless though, because I so annoyed about the lack of a menu.  At first, the waitress said they might have some specials, but she came back only to tell us that the chef didn't have any that night.  Really?  Seriously?  A lack of menu means that I had no idea what to order.  Sure, I can list an Italian dish or two, but COME ON!  So, instead of oooh-ing and ahhh-ing over delicious sounding dishes, we had a frenzy of searching on our phones. The waitress came back to our table 3 or 4 times and we weren't ready to order yet - throw us a bone here!!!  I'm not even going to tell you what I ordered, because it's irrelevant.While I appreciate that the cook CAN cook whatever I want, I want a menu with SOMETHING to choose from.  Perhaps they could list the 10 most popular dishes people order and then list all the main ingredients.  Apparently, some pasta is homemade and other types are not.  I would have liked the homemade kind, but I gave up on asking questions as it got me NOWHERE.  I didn't end up with homemade pasta, or I else I would have told you what it was like! The other disadvantage to a menu-less restaurant is the cost.  Who knows what it will cost because THERE IS NO MENU. Reviews have been saying it's inexpensive.  We paid $200 with tip for 6 of us, plus one appetizer, and we BYOB.In the future if I read that there's a menu, I might think about coming back.

My experience last night was largely better than my previous experience at brunch.First off, the food (a prix fixe menu for the garden party) was for the most part very good. One dish (a duck egg dish) was rather bland but the rest of the food was good. The pours for the wine pairing were a bit light but the selections were excellent. My biggest problem was again the lack of foresight on the behalf of the kitchen staff regarding sharing. The way this event was set up was a family style service. However several dishes came out with a number of items that were not able to be shared equally among the group of 8 individuals (4 couples) at our table. For example one dish was served with some oysters however there were only 7 oysters...for 8 people. Another course were small smoked oyster buns. There were 12 of them at our table of 8. Some people were able to have seconds and others were not. It was a bit awkward at a table of strangers to decide who got the extra food. Portions should have been allocated in a way that they were divisible by the number of people at the table (and they certainly knew this in advance. It was a pre-ticketed event with two tables. One 4-top and one 8-top. It should have been easy to portion accordingly, but clearly it was not thought about by the kitchen staff. Another small quibble was that for an event like this it would have been nice to have a dedicated server that had no other tables.

Unless you are satisfied with pasta that tastes like you could have bought it frozen from Fred Meyer. This is literally the most overpriced, worst food I have ever eaten in Portland. The salads are bagged lettuce with dressings that taste like a mix of mayonaise and milk. The ceaser dressing literally tasted like lemon juice, milk, mayo and black pepper. Sickening.  We ordered the \\"traditional\\" pizza crust which was fine, but the pizza itself lacked flavor and was cold. The calzone was soggy and overstuffed, but still better than pizza or pasta. The only edible item we ordered was the garlic bread.Also, OVER PRICED.... 1.50 for every side of dressing? For people who don't know, that costs the restaurant 15 cents! The mark up on this horrible disgusting food should tell you this is not worth it.The pasta which was priced $9-$11. Trust me when I tell you it tastes like a frozen tv dinner. If you want this quality of food, walk to your local gas station and spend 3.50 on a Lean Cuisine instead of $11 on Bandini pasta. I would have never called to complain if the prices matched the quality. HORRIBLE SERVICE- When I called to complain, (and I have literally never done this, I am a bartender and my boyfriend a cook)  the best he could give me was 25% off the next time I ordered. He upped the deal to 50% off when I explained exactly what the issues were. I explained that I found raw mushrooms in BOTH the calzone and the carbanara.

Anyone that has ever worked in a restaurant should know this is not an excuse. Did I mention I was talking to the cook the whole time.

The ribs were incredible as was the sauce which has a nice little kick but nothing the worry about for even the most delicate of pallets.  The mac and cheese was fantastic and the rum baked beans were some of the best ever.The chicken was nice and moist and on the white bread they give you, you can make a great chicken sandwich with some sauce on top.While I sit here finishing my collard greens, I keep wondering why no one in N. California can do ribs like this or most places in the South. There is a Phatt Matt's in Oakland, CA that is damn good for CA bbq but the ribs here are just different.  It's the meat for sure...here it is pull apart tender which shreds apart compared to west coast bbq which tends to be a denser meat over all from what I have experienced.DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!!

The burger patty is a hemp burger...just as flat and mushy as the Garden Burger. The fries were (though cooked in a separate frier) were 1.5 inches long, mushy and oily, and brought nearly 10 minutes ahead of the burgers.  The server...I think here name was Monica, could not have been less interested in our visit; When she brought the fries we did not have napkins or forks so we used our hands.  When the burgers came, we asked for utensils; after a minute I found a customer who was not using theirs...they kindly gave us forks. The only good thing was the sauce for the burger.

We are both in the restaurant business and love to try new places when we can.The good things:\\n-Server was nice.\\n-Bartender was nice when he brought out the food.\\n-The Banana Cream Chocolate Pie was awesome!\\n-Chef was interacting with guests in the dining room.\\n-Key Lime Pie was pretty tasty as well.The bad things:\\n-Service was slow, even other tables around us were commenting.\\n-Ordered the Dungeness Crab Wontons- honestly, a Chinese dump of a restaurant make these better.  The \\"puffs\\" did not have one stitch of crab in them, and they were $8.95.\\n-Ordered the \\"Frickin Huge Fish Burrito\\".  It was between this and the fish tacos for me.  The server said, \\" Ya, they're both great, but it really depends on what you are in the mood for.\\"  She should not have lied to me.  I saw right through it, but I went ahead and ordered it anyway because it really did SOUND good.  No flavor whatsoever, dry, and it really was FRICKIN huge.  I disliked this so much that I told the server I did not want it anymore.  I only took three bites.  She came back and said I am going to buy you dessert now.  I wanted dessert anyway and so I took her offer.  This was only a ploy to cover up the fact that the Fish Burrito was horrible and tasteless.  I would have much rather had the burrito taken off the bill, and paid for dessert.  \\n-The bartender is the only one who filled up our waters.  This could go up under the good things, but what I wanted to point out here was that the server was not around very often.

Our server was very friendly and attentive. We decided to order only small plates, no entrees. The three best dishes we had were the unbelievably delicious kale salad with pistachio dressing, the rotolo (I could make a meal out of a couple of these, and one for dessert) and the heirloom eggs.  I don't know which was better, the deliciousness of every dish we had, or the artful presentation. Our dining experience should have been 5 star, and would have been except for the music, which was on the loud side and filled with profanities. We're sitting in this chic restaurant, enjoying sumptuous dishes clearly prepared with great care. The whole experience was marred by the background of rap music punctuated by mofos, f-bombs, and n words. It was jarring to hear those words over and over, to the point where we couldn't ignore them, so the music moved from background to foreground.

It's simple, it's to the point and cash only.We ordered away and within a couple of minutes, after a bit of miscommunication, our food was ready, in a paper bag and we walked outside, to one of the three tables they have right in front with a few plastic chairs. The sun in our faces, with cold drinks and are freshly made breakfast sandwiches in hand, it made for a perfect way to start the day. I had a Canadian bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant while she had the same on a sesame bagel.

To begin, we were asked our preference of water vs. sparkling water with no mention of a $7.50 upcharge for a bottle of said sparkling water. Admittedly, we'll take that one on ourselves. The vibe of the restaurant seemed hipster enough to not be surprised by the $7.50 sparkling water fee. But future notice, it would be useful to let customers know beforehand. On to the food. We ordered their version of pasta with pancetta and ricotta cheese which turned out to be more like pasta with salt and cheese. The dish was so over salted that even the $10 sparkling bottle wasn't enough to wash it down. Thankfully, the size of the portion was significantly smaller than we expected so our suffering was minimal. Next, we ordered their signature fried chicken. Fortunately, for us, this dish was an expected size for an entree which made up for the previous miniature salt-fest. Possibly, I'm biased being raised in the south, but for fried chicken to be your signature dish, it had better come with some serious flavor at least. This was not the case. The 3 best things going for this dish were that the chicken was boneless, the skin was decently crispy, and the dipping sauce was not so bad. Apart from that, it was a mediocre fried chicken at best. All in all, BISq to our disappointment was a very underwhelming experience."},{"name":"Super Fusion Cuisine","address":"54 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"Today was a sushi-craving kind of day.

We got sweet potato roll (AMAZING), Spider roll (always my favorite, crunchy and really fresh), Spicy Salmon, Crazy roll, Salmon sushi (2pc), and Philadelphia roll.

Awesome for people with the alternative diet. Pricey and the food was mediocre at best. Staff was responsive and courteous. Big sloppy plates section of the menu is very misleading - we ordered chili mac and received it in a tiny bowl(not a big sloppy plate after all). Maximum 5 bites in that bowl. The sides that we ordered were bigger portion than the chilli mac. Very disappointing. Although the staff was understanding of the confusion and removed that from the final bill but for $6.00 bucks I am sure you can get better food at Fast food joints than here.  We didn't order much besides the sides and one dog and our bill was about $25.00 (no alcohol). Also the food tasted stale and salty. Mediocre food- unhygienic facility.

Actually, let's not make any judgement at all. I've learned that when you're 3000 miles away from the Mexican border, you should just give up hope. But that doesn't mean you can't get really good food here, its just unique in every sense.Feeling like fajitas? They're awesome, and just like my math, the price-to-portion ratio works out perfectly. Want something a bit more unorthodox? Get the taco salad.Or, you could try to answer one of life's more intriguing questions. For example, why do almost all cultures love meat and potatoes? The Canadians have poutine, the French have steak frites (and no the French and Canadians aren't the same), and the Irish have Guinness stew. If you're lucky enough to have tried a California burrito great, but at Border you can get Carne Asada with fries! I guess you can ask for a tortilla and make your own Cali burrito, or you could fake a French accent and try \\"Steak frites\\".The flavors aren't going to blow you away like a fine dining experience, but the food is always tasty, hot, and plentiful.

The chef has created an impressive menu with unusual dishes, complemented by an even more unusual array of spices, fruits and grains.

Each dish offered an element of surprise; the Tuna had the Watermelon carpaccio, the Green Beans the crispy Mushrooms, the Lamb the Burrata cheese and Gooseberries and the Duck the Hibiscus Pickle. If I were at home and decided to make these four dishes, it would never occur to me to pair any of them with the ingredients the chef used, but that's what made the meal so worthwhile, fun and delicious. I honestly wanted to lick my plate at the end of the meal--each item was that good, with perfectly balanced flavors and portions. Just enough to sate your hunger, but leaving you feeling like you could have had a few more bites. Our server, Sabrina, was quite attentive and accommodating, which made the experience that much more enjoyable. My only complaint was the noise level.

But when we pulled up it started raining  's &  'a. So we decided to wait but then parking was hectic so we said let's just find some where else. I googled restaurants in the area and Revival came up. I had never heard of it but the menu and the description looked like something I'd be interested in. We got there at about 4:40. They didn't open until 5. So we waited. When we go in the host says they are fully booked but that we could sit at the bar and have dinner. I was worried because my mom is not a \\"sit at the bar type\\"  But she said she wanted to try the place so it was ok. So we sit and we're greeted by Kevin. Who was great by the way. He explained the concept and the menu. We decided to go with the family meal. Which is $42 per person. Now I was born and raised here so at first I was like \\"do I want to pay $42 for soul food?\\" Lol Now each person chooses an entree and they pick your 5 shareable sides. It includes an appetizer, desert, and coffee or tea. My mom chose the meatloaf and I had the fried chicken. The appetizer was a smoked salmon pasty bite. I liked it. And a Kale/strawberry  salad. Delicious. Once our meals come out we realize that we have enough food for four or five people!  The meatloaf was excellent! Thick and juicy. The chicken was very good. It wasn't complete though. Had to ask Kevin for hot sauce. Lol  The mac n cheese was creamy & tasty. My mom loved the cabbage. It was tasty but I'm not big on cabbage so I let her have that. Another side was grits with a tomato sauce. Yesssss! It actually complimented the fried chicken. The greens were tender. They were a little bland for my liking but I added salt and pepper and I was good. My mom got the strawberry  fried pie w/ice cream and I got The Lemon ice box pie. Both were delicious. I really didn't want to share my pie after I tasted it though . Overall everything was great. Great Service as well.

I live a few blocks away and had only come for lunch, but decided to try it out for dinner with friends. I thought the food was great, much better than Red Bones (which I think is very overrated), but I think the decor could use some work.I thought when this place was in its infancy, that the decor was a work in progress, but it hasn't really changed. The red walls are jarring, the lighting is off, and it is too spacious feeling. Almost cafeteria-like. It could really use either some room division or some kind of hanging lights (not spot lights/pot lights). All of my friends agreed when we ate there last week. You kind of want a BBQ place to feel homey and it just has an odd, unnerving quality.I have always liked the pulled pork here, but I tried some new things this time. (I will add that I love that they have North Carolina sauce. My husband is from NC and every time we go there, we love to get BBQ. Of course, it is much cheaper and much better than anything in Boston.)  My husband and I shared a fried chicken plate and a half rack of baby back ribs. We both agreed that the chicken was delicious - juicy and the batter was well seasoned. The ribs weren't the greatest. You kind of had to gnaw the meat off the bone. (At red bones, I had to literally RIP it off the bone with my teeth though - not good.) I don't know why BBQ places here can't slow cook the ribs enough so that the meat falls off the bone. We make them at home and they are better than anything I have had in a restaurant.We also started the night out at the bar waiting for our friends and had a couple of corn dogs. Delicious, cheap, and yummy mustard sauce. I drank sweet tea since I am preggers and it was also great. Almost as good as NC sweet tea.I always enjoy the cornbread here. The baked beans were too sweet for everyone at our table's taste. The collards were yummy and the mac and cheese is pretty decent quality.I'll definitely be going back for the chicken and corn dogs. But owners, please make the place a tad more inviting. :)Oh, also, I am not a fan of the quasi \\"seat-yourself\\" policy here. Very confusing.

I especially like the (cat)fish tacos (though I wish they didn't use fried catfish) and the tostada grande (though I wish they hadn't made it bigger recently; I used to be able to eat it all, including the bowl). And the never-ending tortilla chips and salsa are really good. A curious thing about this place (neither positive nor negative) is that they don't offer dessert.Another odd thing: this is the only restaurant I've been where, when you arrive for dinner, they ask if you'll be drinking. Depending on your answer, they'll seat you in the drinking or non-drinking area. Seems an odd bit of segregation to me, especially since those few of us not drinking tend to be put in an emptier, slightly less festive area.

Just because you think your place is hip doesn't mean half your staff has to think they're too cool to be even borderline pleasant. This is becoming an epidemic.You know, scratch that. I prefer withering looks and deeply questioning whether my food is being spit in when I dine out.What makes a great hot dog? Creative toppings? Amusing names? Pot shots at Fox News political personalities?What makes a hot dog great is putting a GREAT HOT DOG on a great bun. I'm not looking for an average hot dog on an average bun, which is Dirty Franks' default offering. You can tweak the dog itself to of better quality or cooked to your liking, but invariably the bun will be a bland poppy seed affair that is said to be \\"steamed\\" but tastes fresh out of the bag. The Vienna dog Franks favors is light on size but at least is somewhat flavorful. Avoid it anyway. Cough up a Kennedy and go with a jumbo, or throw down three Washingtons for a brat or polish sausage to make the experience worthwhile. Otherwise it's too much bun and too little meat (awkward cough).There are many tasty dogs on the Dirty Franks menu. The restaurant seems to be cognizant of its strengths, and you're better off sticking to the ones that have a star attached. No star, you're pushing your luck. Avoid anything with cream cheese on it. This isn't Seattle and DF doesn't know how to make this work. I thought to order a bagel on the side for the excess cream cheese on my Dog From Hell. (By the way, if you say something features a \\"satanically spicy Giardiniera pepper mix\\", at least back it up rather than loading my dog with the pansy ass peppers you gave me. \\"Satanically spicy\\" should curl the hair on my balls.) The \\"Top Dogs\\" section of the menu perplexes me, as this seems not indicative that these are good dogs, rather the most expensive offerings.Outside of the uninteresting buns, there are enough options at DF to satisfy any hot dog fan.

One friend is vegan and he suggested that we stop by here because a lot of the desserts are actually vegan friendly.We got there around 10:30/11 on a Friday night and the place was busy but not too busy that we had a wait.

We pulled out our phones to provide a bit of lighting and allow us to figure out what we wanted to eat.  The menu has appetizers/tapas, salad, sandwiches, pasta, and entrees.I ordered a turkey burger, another person had the cold plate, and the vegan had the Penne Albufera and substituted a tomato sauce for the cream sauce that comes with it.  My turkey burger was good, but nothing spectacular.  It came with fries and a salad.  I actually thought that the fries were the best part of the meal.  I ate all of them.  The other dishes looked pretty good and they seemed to enjoy them.One of my friends ordered a glass of white wine.  I'm not sure what kind.  But, she said that it was not good in a \\"the bottle has been opened way too long\\" kind of way.

That's with a great Peppered Beef Tataki app.Also, we were in and out in 1 hour, on a Friday night, at 8PM. Plus we had our green teas filled multiple times. No smell of tobacco in the entrance and the place was a funky little sushi place.

That being said, I'm still giving it five stars. Yeah, you definitely have to wait a long time. And you really should think twice about driving because parking is an absolutely nightmare. BUT if you love Tex-Mex, you'll realize it's worth the wait. Border Cafe is an experience in itself - and the price is definitely right. Border Cafe is a theme restaurant, and is definitely casual.  Again, I judge on a bias because I love theme restaurants.  You'll probably hear some mariachi bands, you'll probably hear some Jimmy Buffet.  I don't even like Jimmy Buffet, but I still would sit through Cheeseburgers in Paradise just because Border Cafe is THAT good.  The complimentary chips and salsa are absolutely delicious. They're warm, they're salty, they're crisp, and they're bottomless. The salsa is simple, but it compliments the chips really well. If you finish your basket before your drinks get to you - which is possible- don't worry!  Ask your waiter/waitress for another basket. It happens to the best of us. Just be careful. It's definitely possible to fill up on them - so try to moderate your chip intake. As for the entrees, they're all quite good. My family orders everything from fajitas, to blackened catfish, to tacos, to burgers, to the eggplant royale. It's all good, really.  My personal favorite, however is the Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad. It's huge for one, so it really is more of an entree than an appetizer.  Also, I don't know what makes this Caesar dressing so tasty, but it's a perfect combination of zing and cream - and compliments the spices of the Blackened Chicken to a T! Definitely delicious, definitely something that you want to bring home if you can't finish. Two margaritas and you've sufficiently warmed yourself up for an evening at Tommy Doyle's or Hong Kong or wherever your post-dinner destination may be.

I have also been to Texas and Mexico so I know what REAL Mexican food is. That said, I have been on a mission to find a quality Mexican restaurant in the area and Border Cafe was attempt number three. I went with my boyfriend and we got there around 5:30pm on a Friday afternoon. We were seated right away downstairs in the corner. We were the first table in that area and it felt like we got the shaft. However, that's where the A/C was and it was a very hot day so it was nice to be in that area.  We got chips and salsa right away and they were great. I ordered the Tradicional Margarita and it was good and strong. I didn't even need another one. Chips and Margaritas are one of the most important things to me at  a Mexican restaurant so I would go back for just that alone. However, the food was not that great. I ordered an enchilada and a taco, both chicken, with black beans and rice. My boyfriend ordered a chicken burro with rice and beans. The beans were ok, the rice was not. All three of the entrees tasted exactly the same, despite being in completely different types of cooked tortillas. I don't know if it was the chicken or the sauce they used, but it was not very good. The sauce didn't have any flavor and the chicken was just mush. There was also way too much cheese. I was hungry so I ate almost all of it, but left with a bitter taste in my mouth. The prices are good, but I can see why. Our meal was under $30 with tip. I give three stars for the chips and Margaritas alone , but the food and the service wasn't up to par for me.

The broth is always flavorful, the noodles at the right texture, the menma (bamboo shoots) soaks up the broth beautifully, and the cha-shu is to die for.  Tatsu-ya has the best soft boiled eggs I've eaten and I'm always sad when I'm too full to eat any more. My favorite here is the Tonkotsu Shoyu, and I like to add the woodear mushrooms to it for extra texture.  I also enjoy the Tsukemen, and I appreciate the lime slice they add to it so it can cut through some of the richness when I'm halfway through the noodles.  There's always a line here, but it goes pretty fast since the staff is always on top of things.  This is also a place where you order, eat, and leave.

They were topped with Roma tomato and jalape√±o. Drizzled with cashew cilantro pesto. The rolls were very flavorful. The taste and the creatively definitely blew my mind. It can not be over complemented. We also ordered the all American bacon double cheeseburgushi. Very solid combination of burger and sushi as well.The appetizers were well made, no surprises though. The only suggestion for the restaurant is probably the presentation, there's a good room for them to improve.But I would still give them a five due to the creativity, the taste and the price.

First, you've gotta understand that Jake's sells fresh seafood - their menus are printed daily with the 'catch(es) of the day'.  Anyone worth their salt understands you can't just get crawfish any day of the year.  Please, people, leave your ignorance or stupidity at the door.So now, my review.  I went to a work function months ago and was given two $20 gift certificates to any one of McCormich & Schmick's fabled stores - so I took the opportunity to take my son and his mama out for dinner to Jake's this past weekend.My son, being eight, is the biggest foodie you will ever meet under 10.  This kid has been craving steak for so long and with these coupons, I was like, 'Alright, Aidan, we're gonna get that steak you've been wanting.'Well, after looking at the prices of their steaks (average steak $30 - $40) I thought twice and told him that seafood was more their specialty and that we'd have to grab that steak elsewhere.  I mean, he is only 8.I knew this experience would go well as I got parking literally across the street just minutes after 7pm Saturday night so I didn't have to pay.My son and his mom were just sat seconds prior to my arrival so a big, warm booth awaited me and our server was precious and has probably been working at this establishment for over ten years.  You can just tell.The place was packed.  Looking through the menu and the prices, I wondered just how much money goes through this place daily.  LOTS, let me tell you.The experience is worth it, though.  It makes me feel like I'm in old New Orleans - surrounded by wood, stained glass - it's just nice to have this kind of history in a city as young and modern as Portland.We started w/ Manila clams and the server even commented that the bowl of clams was overflowing - and delicious.We also had a decent bottle of Pinot Noir which didn't exactly pair well with our fish but was tasty and required.I ordered the pecan crusted catfish (from Mississippi, I had to), Aidan ordered a salmon fillet and his mama ordered an item 'off the menu', a stuffed halibut with dungenness crab and shrimp.OMG - it was probably the smoothest, creamiest, buttery-textured halibut I've ever had in my life.The whole meal was outstanding.  We were all stuffed but not disgustingly so.  We ordered a few desserts and even had one given!  The tip will always go up if you throw in a free dessert.  Always.This wasn't my first time @ Jake's - first time was on a business dinner - that night was EXPENSIVE - close to a thousand dollars.  I knew this was a place I likely would not visit in a long, long time but given the certificates, it was a perfect family dinner and was one I thought about all weekend."},{"name":"Oregon Ice Works","address":"3221 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My boyfriend and I were at one of our favorite carts today (Bruce Lee's Kitchen) and we noticed something new nearby. It just so happened to be this new cart... We were interested in what the owner had to offer but we arrived an hour and a half before it even opened so we thought we would have to try it another day. As we chatted with the owner of Bruce Lee's, she told us it was a place we had to try so we killed time wandering the area as we awaited its opening. Finally, 12:30 rolled around and we got to sample the real-fruit Italian Ice.Now don't get me wrong, I love ice cream. I've never been a huge fan of the fruit stuff because it is usually so sugary and leaves a residue at the back of my throat. At Oregon Ice Works, the owner, Kevin, uses real fruit. I ordered the lemon and blueberry and I discovered a huge whole blueberry as I was savoring this Italian Ice. I love finding chunks of fresh fruit in my cool treats! Even though it was a chilly day, this ice was delicious and refreshing. The lemon is a bit overpowering so I would suggest raspberry instead of blueberry if you are pairing flavors.Kevin is off to a great start with his products. He is honing is craft already with trying out secret new flavors using organic ingredients. This cart has great potential. My guy and I can't wait to go back especially in the summertime.

My wife liked her Chicken salad and vegetable egg roll.Now I know that the only good time to come here is between 11 - 11:30 am.The layout is a bit odd due to the door being right in front of the registers.

Their website states their deep dish pies can take up to an hour to be made, so we had the idea to call in our order (and if they'd like, pay for it over the phone) and get there in 20-30 minutes to cut down on their wait. I called in and they wouldn't let us. They will allow carry out orders, but they won't allow call-ahead.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"No Mas Cantina is a Tex-Mex restaurant near downtown on Walker ST. It can be a bit of a pain to get to, as traffic in the area is usually pretty bad. Luckily, parking isn't an issue as there is a valet. It's not free though. There is a $2 fee plus the obligatory tip. It's not that $2 is a lot of money, but these little nickel and dime fees businesses tack on to a services really makes my blood boil. Let's get the bad out of the way first. The food is just not that good. I've had the Carnitas, the chips, the gauc, the tacos and the quesadillas and wasn't impressed by any. In fact, you'll have significantly better Tex-Mex at nearly any random Mexican restaurant you happen to stumble upon across the metro area. Not only that, but it's also twice as experience as those said Mexicans restaurants. No Mas is most certainly not a place I would ever go to only to eat or for take-out. Now that I've gotten the negative out of the way, let's talk about what's good. Each time I've been there with a reservation we've been seated on time, or at most with very little wait. The servers are efficient, polite and friendly. No Mas is a wonderfully decorated restaurant. It's certainly one of the more attractive restaurants in the area, with neat furniture, Southwest/Latin decor and nice lighting. Additionally, there's a shop next door at which  you can buy almost anything that's displayed in the restaurant. Much there is unreasonably expensive, though. It's definitely the type of place that is appropriate for large parties, birthdays or just having a drink at the bar or sitting on the patio on a nice evening. I did enjoy my Santos Margarita and it's quite strong, too. One will definitely give you a buzz and after two, you'll be feeling quite good. It's a bit expensive, though - $11, more than I usually like to pay for a drink. In conclusion, if you're in the mood for good Tex-Mex, don't go here. If you're the mood for drinks with friends in wonderfully decorated restaurant with a cool vibe, this place is for you. Two stars for the food, four stars for the atmosphere, I'll take the average and give No Mas three. Cons: Food. Pricing. Complimentary valet is not complimentary.Pros: Cool atmosphere, good service. Verdict: Recommended if you're only having drinks. Not recommended if you're hungry."},{"name":"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store","address":"2150 Delk Rd","city":"Marietta","stars":"3","text":"Came in at about 3pm.

My husband and I decided to go to Tia's because it's close by, on the water and has a fairly good twin lobster special. We went after a long day at work and I wanted to have some great seafood in a relaxing environment. One out of two isn't bad, I guess.Upon entering the restaurant, we were assaulted by the music and conversation blasting out of the bar area. There's no physical separation, so what happens in the bar carries into the dining area. Once seated at our table, the conversations from the tables around us appeared to be amplified, much like eating in a drum.The waitress brought the menus and my husband ordered the twin lobster dinner. Note these are one pound lobsters, which are little more than glorified crawfish. The sides were french fries and cole slaw. I asked the waitress if I could have something else as I'm on Weight Watchers and wanted something lighter and healthier. Her response was (respectfully) no substitutions. I considered ordering a different side, but they were outrageously expensive and decided to pass. Instead, I ordered a salad with grilled lobster and asked for the dressing on the side. My husband ordered a separate side and asked the waitress to keep the french fries as we wouldn't be eating them. After that, getting her attention was difficult and my husband resorted to getting us water and extra napkins when she didn't return.When the meals came. the twin lobster dinner came with the cole slaw, the additional side (garlic mashed potatoes) and the french fries. When my husband asked the server to take the fries away, she responded \\"Trust me, everyone loves our fries. You'll wind up eating them; you won't be able to help yourself.\\" My salad resembled soup, there was so much dressing poured on it. I said \\"Excuse me, but I asked for the dressing on the side.\\" The server answered with \\"So sorry! I'll bring you some extra on the side.\\"Granted, the servers can't be 100% responsible for whether or not the patrons are watching their diet, but really???Once she realized I didn't want the drowned version of the salad, she took it away and brought me an undressed salad with the dressing on the side.After all this, the reasonable reaction would be to never return. However. The lobster was the best I've had in Boston, or even New England. Sweet, cooked and seasoned perfectly -- they made up for the other inconveniences. My husband's was steamed, mine was grilled, both were absolutely delicious.But we did leave the entire portion of french fries, untouched, on the table.

I thought the restaurant was adequately sized *shrugs* I liked the decor and the fact that they were playing Looney Tunes on the TV...perfect for #TBTAlthough I actually wanted to try the pork burger--I never knew there was such a thing--I went for the corn dog instead since it's Pallookaville's claim to fame. It was pretty good. I can't remember the last time I had a corn dog, but I enjoyed this one. The fries on the other hand...I feel like I was the victim of one of those carnival game scams where I really wanted the big toy prize and ended up with some off-brand, little stuffed animal instead. I grabbed a few tater tots from another Yelper, and those tasted better than the fries. I also sampled another Yelper's mac & cheese, and that was good as well. I wasn't sure about the whole Cheez-It thing, but it works here. Thumbs up for super cheesy deliciousness.Of course, I wouldn't be me if I didn't order a cocktail. I got the Mai of the Tiger--their version of a Mai Tai. It was okay, but I didn't finish it (now that's unlike me) .

It is a good ways from where I live but I happened to be nearby so I dropped in.  I am so glad I did.  This place is exactly what a brewery tasting room should be like.  It is in an industrial park near the Mall at Millenia as well as the Conroy and Kirkman Rd area.This was on a week night so it was not too crowded.  The tasting room is a good sized space adjacent to the brewery itself.  You know you are getting your beer at its freshest.  They also have a little deck outside for outdoor drinking.  Since this is a brewery they do not have food other than chips and small snacks but you are welcome to bring in outside food.  They do have food trucks on certain nights as well.  I was there during the week but I think they have music on the weekends.Rich, the owner and brewer, was behind the bar so I was able to ask some questions and get some good info.  I started with the Purple Skink IPA.  Rich is an admitted hophead as am I so this was a good start.  A very solid IPA for one of their core beers.  It was reminded me of a Surly Furious.  The next beer was the South Bound & Down (only available once a year).  This is a fresh hopped IPA.  Rich's dad owns a hop farm in Ohio.  Every year at harvest he loads a truck full of just harvested hops and brings them straight to the brewery to be immediately put into the mix.  The taste is a fresher, more muted hop flavor.  It's definitely worth it to get this whenever it is available.Now we get to my two favorites.  First, the Gila Monster Chocolate Coffee Stout is my new local replacement for Stone's Xocoveza.  It is a complex beer, not overly heavy, with a nice dry finish.  It was made with dried peppers and cocoa.  I love this beer during the fall and winter time.  It goes well by itself or with food.  Not a sweet stout, this has a lot of complexity.Finally, I had the Humpity Pumpity Double IPA.  This is definitely for the hopheads.  A west coast DIPA but with a full bodied feel.

Ordered 6 dishes for dinner delivery and they told me 45 mins to deliver.  I called after an hour wondering where my food was and they said it was just about there.  Another 30 mins later the delivery driver finally shows up and he's only got 2 of 6 dishes in his bag.  I'm obviously his last delivery and he's given my food to someone else.  We've now waited 1.5 hrs and got 2 dishes.  The driver could have cared less.  I sat and fed my kids the 2 dishes and phoned to tell him not to bother with the rest as it would take another hour.  He them got mad at me and hung up.  I called him back and he again started arguing yet again.  I reminded him that we were long time customers and would never be back. He hung up on me again.  I totally accept that mistakes happen and you can't fault someone for trying, but it's all about how it's handled. These guys failed miserably.  Food is good. Service is horrendous.

The roll is like a hawaiin (sp) sweet bread and it was stale!  at least it tasted that way.  The lobster meat was scarce.  I mean for $25 you would expect a decent amount.  Nope.  Your better off getting the $12 lobster roll from Dog N Claw at the shack down the street.  Its better, actually much better.  However, to Tia's credit, there are a couple other dishes that I saw that looked excellent, and probably worth their $45+ price tag they are charging.  These are the stuffed lobster, and also the surf and turf.  I saw someone with the surf and turf and it was HUGE.  I think it must have been a 14+ oz steak with a lobster.  That looked great.

I politely said that I just wanted to know what's inside - for which I got yelled for, looked down at, and then that person walked away from me!!!, while the other sales person completed my order. I then politely inquired about the oatmeal cookie that they forgot to give me, which they literally threw in my face without saying anything.

Don't come in expecting top-shelf cocktails and fancy attire - it's a very casual place. The crowd is a great mix, the drinks are cheap, the bartenders hot, and the food is good. I personally recommend the tacos - at $1.50 each, with carnitas, carne asada, and pollo to pick from, they're a must have. The burger is ok, and there's a lot of just pretty standard bar-fare on the menu. But talk to Jorge the cook, and he'll hook you up! The parking lot usually gets packed early on, so you're best parking on the street - or walk/ride your bike. There's a few racks to lock up to. It's pretty easy to catch a cab for the ride home too - no waiting for hours like at places downtown. I usually hit up first Fridays for Static - run by local techno label Subsensory. They have a rotating roster of djs, and occasional out-of-town guests. Fourth Friday is Flash, hosted by Nude Photo Music - another local label. In spirit of full disclosure, I run Nude Photo Music. We host a different guest DJ every month, with talented producers & djs from SF, LA, and Seattle - supported by a local favorite. If you like techno, tech-house, minimal, etc - you're going to love both those nights.

I ordered a Chicago dog and a Cowgirl Carmen, both excellent! My son had an mac and cheese with an Octodog, which is a hotdog cut like an octopus, amusing for a four year old of course! My wife didn't have anything memorable. There are so many options on the menu I can't wait to go back! Definitely easy on the wallet too.I had heard so much about this place from friends before finally being able to sample hot dog bliss. I'm a huge chili dog fan and my wife used to work around the corner from Dirty Frank's and would eat there regularly, so I was definitely upset and jealous that I had to wait so long to eat there.The atmosphere is nostalgic, similar to Betty's, Buckeye Donuts, and The Thurman Cafe (I believe Betty's and another restaurant are under the same ownership as Frank's). Prior to visiting, I had no idea it was also a bar. Frank's lived up to its reputation. I'm a firm believer that Frank's along with Buckeye Donuts and The Thurman Cafe are a must see for anyone visiting the area.

The menu covers southern cajun and tex-mex, offering appetizers like Chorizo Flambado and Crawfish Popcorn. There's a good selection of entrees and even the vegeterian dishes are flavorful and filling. They could easily charge a lot more for what you're getting, there might be one thing on the menu for over $15 (and I think it serves two!) but most of it's under $10.

It's just off a main highway with lots of parking around it. I remember the Wendy adverts from the 1990's when the now deceased owner Dave Thomas told us on telly: 'Wendy's. The home of the square hamburger, always fresh never frozen.' Dave was a big player in the early days of developing 'Kentucky fried Chicken' so a fast food wizard. He was originally a U.S. army cook. He made enough cash to set up his own burger chain and he named it after his daughter - how predictable. Enough of my rambling; it was a scorching 33 degrees centigrade, and azure blue skies as we pulled into Wendy's. The guy on the radio was complaining about the heat wave. I thought, shut up ya twit it's just lovely. My ideal temperature. Mind you I had the head staggers as I mistakenly ordered a large burger meal instead of the standard size - three quarters of a pound of meat in three square burgers, cheese and all the other stuff that Americans wedge into a meal in one hand. Then a bucket full of French fries and talking of buckets the cup for my diet coke must a held at least a litre of fluid. All this food for under $10. And very friendly servers too. Next I went to the drinks dispenser machine. It was a touch screen TV screen. I tapped the screen. Bloody hell the selection was staggering so after an initial glance I narrowed in on the caffeine free coke zero choice. About seven or eight choices popped up - the generic one, then others flavoured with lime, orange, vanilla and on and on. I opted for the lime flavour and it wasn't bad. Although the in - store air con was very effective, 33 degrees was calling me so it was dining Al fresco. It was just wonderful sitting outside basking in great heat. Luxury.

We were there with the fam my 15 month old son yesterday for dim sum.  He got a bit \\"ornery\\" (his grandfather's fault - yes, I'm throwing him under the proverbial bus!!), and I proceeded to take him outside for a quick stroll for a change of scenery and soothing.  On the way back in, the hostess (same lady who screams for the next party as you wait for your table, \\"NUMBA FORTEE TOO, NUMBA FORTEE TOO\\"), says to me, \\"is that girl?\\"  \\"No, he's a boy!!\\"  \\"A boy?\\"  \\"Yes, a boy\\" (taps the shoulders of the other ladies behind the front desk) \\"That a boy??\\"  \\"Oh, really???\\"  \\"Ahhhhh.....\\"  Growing up in a first generation Chinese family, \\"Emily Post\\" was not high on the reading list and a comment from the parental units like, \\"you look fatter,\\" is meant to be a compliment (a sign of good fortune and prosperity) and not the way its intended here in the States.  Yet despite the \\"barbs,\\" I LIVED for my grandmother's food and miss it dearly since she passed years ago.  Same thing here (hence the 5 stars).The food has always been fantastic at HLM.  The shrimp dumplings (har gow) for example, has a nice sweetness, and neither oversteamed nor overstuffed with \\"filler\\" as some dim sum houses tend to do.  The beef \\"cheung foon\\" (it's like a Chinese cannelloni - seasoned ground beef, wrapped around a wide rice noodle, with a sweet soy sauce) had a nice balaced texture and the sweet soy [sauce] was niether too salty nor too sweet.  Speaking of food, the dim sum carts come at a nice pace - fast enough so you're not starving to death, yet not too fast so that you're drowning in dim sum like funnelling \\"Pabts Blue Ribbon\\" at a fraternity kegger.And on the topic of the \\"intangibles,\\" diners will note that tables actually real table cloths.  Having had many a meal in Chinatown and seeing waiter clean tables with tea (I kid you not), the table cloths are a very nice touch and something Hishonor Menino should mandate in Chinatown.  So if you want to be treated with kit gloves, try the Golden Temple in Brookline (fabulous place by the way).  But if you want great food, good prices, and get a little does of well intended old school, Chinese parent berating, take a trip to HLM.(TIP:  spend the $10 and park in the garage just upstairs from the restaurant)."},{"name":"Dark Horse","address":"2922 Baseline Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Great burgers, fries, ambience.

I suppose the overcooking is what gives them the chewy texture that I adore. And they are not breaded, which I prefer also. Their subs, fries and onion rings are all pretty good, but their wings are out of this world. The lemon pepper wings are also absolutely fantastic. They have chewy wings, not mushy like lots of other places. And their sauces are the best I have ever had. Hubbie and I get 50 wings when we go, which lasts us a couple of days. We get wings from there bi-weekly. It does take a little a while to get food from there, it isn't really fast food. But that is because they make the food. When you ask for wings, they fry them.

But the best thing of the meal was a summery pear puree & ginger infusion drink I ordered- yummy and refreshing...would have been great with champagne too if I wasn't driving.  Bartender was very friendly, recommended the crab hash and chatted with me a bit (but not excessively, which is key- I do not like being hovered over at a restaurant!).

Inside they have a pool table which I don't use and a Juke box machine so if you like to hang out with friends bring them here.

The chicken was very good and it was juicy, so you know it was cooked right. The chicken comes with garlic collard greens which was an interesting taste, as I've only had greens traditionally at BBQ places. The shrimp & grits was great. Everything worked well together.

It was a $70 pre-fix menu.  We were told that this covered your cover charge, dinner, and entertainment.  Unfortunately, there was no entertainment - so we were really paying $70 for a four course meal.  First course - shrimp cocktail.  What we each got was a medium sized shrimp cut in half down the middle.  That is right, half of a medium sized shrip was the first course.  No joke.  Plus, everyone thought they tasted bad and our server told us they were the last of an old batch.  Why even tell us this?Second course - you had your choice of a few things.  I got raviolies.  When it arrived, it was cold.  But, the worst part was, it tasted and looked like chef boy-r-dee mini-raviolis (remember these from when you were a kid?) and there were only 5 of them.  Gross.Third Course - I went for a ribeye with bacon mac and cheese.  First, it was well done and I asked for medium rare.  I didn't bother sending it back as we had waited SOOO long at this point.  It was just bad.  I thought the mac and cheese would be the saving grace.  What I got was a two-inch by two-inch cube of it and it was just bland.Fourth Course - I got the three chocolate thing.  It would have been fine except somethere in it were jalepeno peppers that made the thing nearly impossible to eat.All in all - this place should have been ashamed to take my money.

One is the almost militant-like operational efficiency and two is the amazing pork broth ramen. You want to get to Tatsu-Ya early in the evening as the line tends to grow and start wrapping around outside the restaurant in the hours beyond 6. You will be assigned a table and given a number while you are in line and waiting to order at the counter. The menu is pretty simple with 4 or 5 different ramen options. I generally get the pork broth or Tonkotsu ramen that comes with egg, seaweed, bamboo shoots and garlic. Another popular item that is quite delicious is the Dipping ramen which comes with noodles and broth separated. If you are feeling like an extra kick of flavor you can add one of three different \\"bombs\\" to your ramen (spicy, super spicy, and corn). There are also some rice bowl options (chashu or curry) you can add as a combination to your ramen for a few dollars more. Once you are finished eating a Tatsu-Ya employee will kindly ask if there is anything else s/he can get for you and sort of prompt you to leave. It all comes back to that lean six sigma operational efficiency they are so good at. When you are prompted to leave, don't fret friend. You are allowing another group of people to enjoy their turn at slurping down a delicious bowl of ramen.

Not only was our table sticky and reeked of soys sauce but our chairs and booth cushion were both beyond sticky. So sticky in fact that my butt was stuck to the cushion after we had paid and were leaving. Luckily we were we had some baby wipes in our diaper bag and just decided to clean the mess up ourselves. Sure enough our wipes were yellow by the time we had wiped just the table down.  We had an inkling that our table was never cleaned just cleared after the previous guests meal. Our inkling was confirmed when the family next to us left after their meal. A manager cleared the table, while a team member placed down new utensils and napkins, never once did they wipe down the table. I have heard so many positive things regarding the food that I was willing to put the sticky situation behind us.However, things only got worse when we got our food. I had ordered my burger, medium. But when the burger arrived it was burnt to a crisp and dry, obviously well done. I am not one to usually say anything but my wife insisted. Our waiter agreed that it was definitely well done and brought it back to the kitchen to be re made. He came right back and insisted that it would be only a 2-3 minute wait. After 10 more minutes of waiting and after my wife and kids had finished their meals, we tracked down a manager who went to check on the status. It would be another 5 minutes before he came back with the burger. As anyone with small kids will tell you, time is of the essence when eating out. With a 1 year old melting down and a 4 year old itching to leave, I had to ask for our check as they brought the new burger out. With so many other options at city walk, I doubt we will be back.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Having been to nearly every well known BBQ joint in the country (no exaggeration) a buddy and I finally came to Fox Bros. We'd done Fat Matt's many times, the Jim N Nick's, Moe's, etc, for years. Fox has an excellent setting, it's clean, upbeat and great service and I think they do a few things exceptionally well, namely the brisket and ribs. However, there's other sides of the menu that are mediocre. We were blown away by the ribs. They were tender, tasteful and the meat fell off the bone. The brisket was top-notch. Incredible flavor. However, the pulled pork was average and the biggest downfall was the BBQ sauce. If you aren't a fan of wing sauce, as I'm not, stay away. If you like wing sauce, you'll fall in love. Unfortunately, there's no other sauce to fall back on, therefore it's boom or bust. Their sides are strong. I had the tator tots, which tempt you to eat every one with great seasoning. The fried okra is good, too, but we couldn't get past the first bite of the Brunswick Stew, largest because of that wing sauce flavor. We had the same probably with the Frito pie. As for the desserts, I was thrilled to try the chocolate pecan pie, but didn't make it past the first three small bites. It was hard, dry and flavorless, not what I expected from a well known spot. Our waitress said they had a pastry chef who makes them daily at their sister restaurant. Meanwhile, it taste like it had just been thawed. On the other hand, if you come and order the brisket and ribs you'll rave about this place, as we did when we left. And, fortunately, there's enough flavor in those items when you don't need to pollute your mouth with that tangy BBQ sauce. I'd find it hard for anyone not to enjoy a trip here, especially if you stick to the above."},{"name":"Zabu Chicken","address":"1635 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"A smorgasbord of flavor.

Depending on where you live in the Lower Mainland, you might have to drive a lil' farther but it definetly won't cost you a plane ticket to get there! May I recommend the French Table, one of the newest additions to the heightening calibre of Main street dining adventures!  Was most definetly intrigued when my friend decided on this restaurant for her brunch birthday celebration; especially when I've been looking to re-live my parisian palate experiences from a recent Paris trip.  Our party was greeted by a friendly hostess whom directed us to our on-time girlfriend waiting in the booth.  She was awashed in bright sunlight as our table was in front of a huge window, allowing for lots of natural light in the bistro.  Although the walls were of a darker brown color, the sunlight gave the mid-size restaurant a cozy and homey feeling.  Such adorable cups!! I am an expresso cup collector and I only wish I can add theirs to my collection.  Each cup had different designs and small in size which encourages you to sip their aromatic and full-bodied coffee like the Europeans, and not gulp a Starbucks coffee like us Canadians.  Really the star of the show, the food.  Although I was in the mood for eggs, their two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce wasn't waving and jumping at me.  It was instead my forgotten french vocabulary that drew me towards the frisee with soft poached eggs.  As explained by the waiter, the salad consisted of exotic curly endives mixed in a simple Dijon vinaigrette with scattered bacon pieces, topped off with a soft poached egg.  The surprise? Once the golden, gooey goodness is cracked and mixed in the salad, it thickens up the dressing making it sweet and creamy.  Yummm!!! Only mild change I would make is it was a tad bit on the salty side and I was glad I substituted the bacon for the shrimp or else the refreshing greens would have been drowned.  I wasn't the only satisfied customer.  The shrimp and brie cheese buckwheat crepes came in three cute pockets  and were devoured by my girlfriend.  Everyone else enjoyed their eggs benedict adorned by an array of colourful starch and veggie sides; one of us even soaked up the last drip of delish yolk with her brown toast!The sweet tooth feeling a little left out, I caved in to ordering a weekend guilty pleasure to round out the meal.  Expresso creme brulee with a side of hazelnut biscotti.  Need I say more? It was presented in a shallow, slightly-bigger-pecan-tart-sized ramekin, allowing for 6 of us to each try a spoonful.  Presentation? Couldn't wait to crack through the sugary top to get to the creamy yumminess underneath! Result? Took some unexpected muscle to break the inch-thick sugar crust and was a little disappointed to find the cream cooled and slightly bland.  The biscotti was more of a shortbread consistency  and had an unexpected taste of a certain spice -- try it! This is not the last I will see of the creme brulee. =)Sincere and honest staff (we asked our waitress what her favorite brunch item was and she shy-ly replied \\"Breakfast is not my most enjoyed meal of the day!\\"..love the honesty!) providing personable service and attention is half the equation of a successful restaurant.  I can't wait to come back for dinner to give this delightful bistro the remaining two stars!

The interior is easily the most upscale of the dim sum restaurants in Chinatown and is more or less on par with some of the better spots I've been to back in California.  All the dishes are well done with particularly good custard-filled Pineapple buns, Malay Steamed Sponge Cake, and steamed tripe.

I guess I was shocked, because given the option these customers woke up earlier to have a full meal before embarking on their day. Whereas I would always take the extra time to sleep in. You are asked to \\"wait to be seated\\" by a sign at the entrance, but I found it hard to attract the only server's attention. He was a large man, quiet and polite. He went and talked at a speed you could appreciate first thing in the morning. I wondered if he was \\"Paul\\". He gave me a table by the bar, despite my order being for take out. He offered me coffee as I waited. And even with my refusal he brought me a glass of water without asking. I liked the level of service he was providing. On the menu is breakfast all day: Omelets on plates, Benedict eggs on English muffins, and bacon with toast on platters. And if you don't see anything you like you can create your own omelette from a list of add ons to the standard: free run eggs, cheddar, Edam and cream cheese. Would I go back? - Yes. I usually don't like places that serve dishes that I can technically make myself. But I have made an exception for \\"Paul\\". Yes these are simple homestyle dishes, but with the addition of speciality ingredients and tasteful garnishes, each plate become exclusive to \\"Paul's Place\\"; and something worth paying for. Plus I can never fold my omelets like this, or poach an egg, let alone the perfectly in pairs. \\nWould I recommend it? - Yes, this is great, less expensive option for breakfast on South Granville. \\"Paul's Omelettery\\" may not be the trendiest spot, or have the best food. But what they do offer is a place for a quick bite, at the same price you would pay for a Mc Meal. Here your money is better spent on something a tad more wholesome, a tad more filling, a tad less guilt giving, and a lot better tasting. They do breakfast all day, though be warned that their day starts at 7am and ends at 3pm. And though their name may suggest otherwise, they do do more than Omelets. In fact, if it involves eggs, \\"Paul\\" is all over it. From scrambles to boiled, to being a coating over bread and the feature star in a Benedict. Don't deny your craving."},{"name":"No Mas!

We even got fried pickles for the table and those were great too.My only cons about Fox Bros is the outside seating situation.  On a breezy August in the 70s it's really nice out there, but maybe store the garbage father away so the stank of the dumpster doesn't nauseate and attract giant bullflies to buzz the tables.  Investing in a big zapper or tiki torches might be a good idea.  Also some slightly more comfortable chairs would be good (grill-butt is not a good look on anyone).But wait!  Who cares about that when there's Frito Pie?!  Mmm.  Shut the front door, that is good!!!  Never ate comfort food out if a foil snack bag before, but holy Frito was an inspired combo!

Whenever I used to drive to and from the airport (primarily) I used to always wonder how it was going to be. Now I can put that wonder to rest. As soon as we walk in, we see that it is packed, yet we find a table to the left. Both seats are facing the kitchen part of the diner (facing forward) ..not the typical seats where they face each other. Menus were already laid out on the table for us - I noticed that there weren't too many selections to choose from. Since I was tired, I knew I was going to get coffee. Coffee came, was very cold very fast. I asked for another coffee and the waitress took forever to bring out another mug. This time the temperature was hot. When she took my previous mug away, she took my spoon away with it. I used my knife - no biggie. I didn't have any more creamers, so I had to ask for more of them. No splenda, so I had to use regular coffee. Not very good for someone who needs to have a sweetener instead of sugar. Food came out, it was okay at best. I thought that since the name of the place is Waffle House, they probably specialized in waffles, right? Wrong! I could easily make those little waffles using a 19 dollar machine from walmart. Nothing special about those waffles at all. We asked about the buttermilk waffles while we were ordering. According to the menu, they seemed like a better choice however, the waitress said that the regular ones were better. Very conflicting information. Since I was tired and wanted my waffles, I let it slide without any fuss. Hash browns were good too, not oily at all. I actually liked them quite a bit! Eggs were done just right. Not too oily and heavy at all. I've had better breakfast, but I don't think I'd really go back because their are not too many choices on the menu AND...it's not really a place to go if you are craving waffles. Honestly? You are better off either A. Making them yourself or B. Going to a hotel here in Austin and making them yourself :-)"},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Some of the best apple pie I have had.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The brisket is where it's at here, and is really the best thing they have going for them. The tater tots have some awesome seasoning on them, which is delicious. All the other sides and BBQ are just so-so, and they could have a better selection of sides to begin with.Somehow, this place is always absurdly busy, and the parking is therefore horrendous. I had the unfortunately experience of living on the same street and had to deal with all of the customers trying to street park in front of houses, occasionally blocking driveways. The food travels well, and I would say take out is truly the way to go."},{"name":"Rami's","address":"324 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Really delicious falafel and hummus.  I also like the pita bread: it's substantial enough to not tear, but not so dense as to overwhelm anything you put inside.  I think the prices are okay, especially given the restrictions and cost of kosher products.  The Rami's Special plate is on the expensive side (16.95) but I've only ordered it once, because it is a LOT of food.  I'll stick to the falafel pita from now on.  Also really enjoy the peach nectar.  I've always had a pleasant experience with the people working here.  They are friendly but efficient."},{"name":"Serafina Downtown","address":"10 High St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The decor and service were great as expected but the food was really on point. I had become a fan of Serafina after eating at this other restaurant in Puerto Rico and chose to repeat a similar order. The beef Carpaccio with truffle sauce as antipasti is really fabulous, mostly if you are a meat lover. The black truffle tagliolini is my favorite dish, creamy and intense with generous portions as well. Other notable dishes are the Veal and Lobster salad, nothing on our table was just good or average. After out Illy coffee we tried the creme br√ªl√©e and even that had us praising the kitchen. I would recommend this to anyone vaguely familiar with Northern Italian food, there is no hit and miss here- just all bulls eyes!"},{"name":"Leo's Place Diner","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!

Omelettes and scrambled eggs are so tasty and so are the home fries! Bacon is crisped to perfection. French toast is great! Note that coffee is stronger than other places. It's delicious, but quite strong."},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was great but it took our server er 15min to bring coffee out, just a tad bit disappointed."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh considering that I went here during after-work rush hour. Buy hey, first impressions are lasting impressions! First off, the service was sub-par at best, the waitress only checked in on us like twice, which is a huge NO NO in my book, no matter how busy the place is. \\nNow the food-first off, our food came maybe within five minutes after ordering it, which is a sure sign that it wasn't made fresh. I ordered the craw fish and shrimp salad, which was \\"meh\\", the shrimp were TINY and the salad itself was boring. \\nMy friend ordered a steak, which tasted just as dry as it looked, plus she complained that it was COLD. She also ordered one of their famous Margaritas, which also tasted as watered down as it looked. The only thing I could say was really yummy were the store bought tortilla chips and salsa they brought out to us-which speaks VOLUMES for this place. Like I said, I shouldn't judge this place so harshly considering it was rush hour, but hey, first impressions are lasting impressions.

We waited in line for about 15 min. (Totally our fault, we did not have a reservation and on a Saturday evening, dinner time in Portland, we know better.) We waited another 30 minutes for a table. Once we were seated our food took about an hour to be served. This was only because there were two large parties of 14 that order before us. Which was fine. I had the fried chicken, mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese and it was amazing. My husband had the brisket, mashed potatoes and coleslaw with a side of corn bread. The sides were amazing, the brisket was good however the corn bread was very dense and gritty.  We ate one bite and sent it back. My kids had Mac and cheese, French fries and fried drum sticks. The sides were amazing the drum sticks were okay. I had the lemonade to drink and It was great and my husband had a Jack and coke. The odd thing is when the bill came they up charge him 50 cents for the coke in his drink. Which clearly was no big deal however it makes the restaurant look a little hard up when they do things like that. In all the food was good however it's a one time experience."},{"name":"Mettle - East Austin Bistro","address":"507 Calles St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my first review on Yelp. A friend suggested I write a review after my experience this evening.\\n I went to Mettle with some friends after work. I had never been there before. It is a quaint little bistro that is absolutely adorable and comfortable inside. The food was superb and the service was excellent. However, about halfway through my visit at Mettle, a young woman--who i'm assuming is an employee-- sat down at a table next to ours with a man--who I'm assuming is a manager or owner--and was subsequently fired.  In the middle of the restaurant. During a busy dinner rush. While customers and employees stared in horror.\\nI overheard their conversation slightly and when the young woman proceeded to start crying and have a total meltdown, my friends and I could not help but sympathize with her. I worked in the restaurant industry in college and I had all I could do not to get up and give this poor thing a hug. Thankfully, another employee gave her a hug before she walked out the door in tears. \\nThe worst part of it all was that the girl kept begging the owner/manager for about 5 minutes to let her keep her only job and source of income while tears and mascara rolled down her face. It was absolutely heartbreaking.\\nI think it is extremely inappropriate to fire an employee in full view of customers during a dinner rush. I will personally not be returning here because I was so put off by the way this poor girl was let go."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Fried Chicken ever...The gravy on the mash potatoes was the best gravy I have ever tasted.
