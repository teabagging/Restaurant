You have the choice of ordering chicken by the bird or by the piece. You can also order a chicken sandwich or biscuit. Chicken can be served plain or spicy (they call it Nashville style). There are also sides you can purchase. I didn't want anything too heavy so I opted for the chicken sandwich over the biscuit. I asked how hot the Nashville style was and the cashier told me really hot. Hmmm. She kinda scared me so I stayed with the plain style. But after eating the sandwich, it needs a kick. So I would try out the Nashville style next time. The sandwich comes with pickles on top and sauce of choice. You may have to ask the staff questions about what some of them mean or what they may taste like. I chose the Frim Fram sauce- a tomato mayo type sauce. I wasn't a big fan, but the sandwich needs sauce. I wouldn't eat the sandwich without it. The chicken was fine, but I felt that it lacked a bit of flavor. The bun was tasty. Overall, it was OK.

As it was a special occasion, we wanted to eat some delicious food and have a great dining experience. Unfortunately, our experience was just OK. Since the menu rotates every week, I'm not sure if we just got the bad end of the stick but the food was not amazing.\\n\\nThe first course was pretty much a clam chowder with some bacon and some crispy onions. It was a very heavy way to start the meal. We both thought it was alright. \\n\\nThe second course was the charcuterie plate with steak tartare, foie gras, chicken liver mouse, veal carpaccio, pork sausage, etc. (I believe this course is consistent in their menu) There were one or two things that I thought was good, but even then, not incredible.\\n\\nThe third course was the poussin presse with brussels sprouts, butternut squash puree, and mustard jus. The butternut squash, in my opinion, wasn't too flavorful. My husband on the other hand, preferred this sauce to the mustard jus. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the meat was of great quality, but this plate was still \\"just ok\\" in our book.\\n\\nFourth course was an iceberg salad wedge with corn, radishes, fried shallots, and herbed buttermilk dressing. This course surprised me the most. With a $102 price tag per person, you're going to give me iceberg lettuce? Oh, it was from some hipster farm south of Portland? Great... it still tastes like those cheap bagged salads from the store you eat with the dried up carrots and red cabbage. Anyway, this was something anyone could easily make at home and it definitely was not something to rave about. \\n\\nFifth course was a selection of various cheeses. One from the Netherlands (? could have been from Denmark? Can't recall), one from Piedmont, and another from the UK. They were all cows milk. I liked the first two, the last left a dirty feeling in my mouth. The accompanying crackers were ok, the biscuit type cracker they gave me was not great and I didn't think it went with the cheese very well.\\n\\nSixth and final course was the chocolate layer cake with huckleberry coulis and toasted oat ice cream. Out of all the courses, I liked this one the best. That being said, it only reached the rating of 6.5 out of 10. I would have been happier walking the few blocks to Salt and Straw for an ice cream cone. Another note about this course was that we alerted the restaurant of my husbands nut allergy prior to our reservation. Since this course contained nuts, he was the last to receive his dessert and pretty much just got ice cream, omitting all the other contents of the dish. Seems pretty lazy and not very thoughtful. \\n\\nAll in all, it was just an OK experience. We thought that since the restaurant won a James beard award, that it would blow our socks off. Sadly for us, it did not. We were also intrigued since we saw Naomi, the owner, on Top Chef and were proud supporters of hers as she was a Portland native. We did see her briefly during our time there when she was closing one of the windows. \\n\\nAs far as ambiance, there is communal seating. At our table, there were mostly couples and they all just spoke to their significant others and did not speak to one another. The lighting was very dim and they had a selection of Bonobo, R2D2, and M83 songs on their playlist. Lastly, we were expecting to be there for around 2 to 2.5 hours. We came in the doors at 8:45pm and was out the door by 11:40... almost 3 hours for us. The chairs are solid wood so we got a bit fidgety towards the end and just wanted them to give us our check so we could go home.

The salsa bar (which is a bonus!) is not necessarily hawk-eyed by the staff, so it routinely runs out (expect to wait several minutes for a restock) and is often a little messy thanks to customers who can't manage to use a ladle and sauce cup.

The fact that this place is so close to my house makes me want to love it. I am happy that a couple Indian restaurants have been opening down south, We used a groupon or living social deal, which made the pricing decent. The decor is quite nice, dimly lit, so could be even romantic if they got rid of some of the big TV's.  I'd rather talk to my dining companion then watch TV. If that weren't the case, I would have stayed home and order a pizza to eat in front of the TV. Here's is where it got a little weird. A friendly hostess seated us, but didn't have enough menus to give us any. What? Then they gave us paper take away menus. You can see the staff has been highly trained to push liquor. Perhaps a little too over trained. I'm guessing the reason for this may be the high price of liquor. I got a glass of Chardonnay and the cheapest option was $12. I don't know about you, but i found that a little steep. The menu seemed disorganized making it hard to read. I asked if the had any Korma (my absolute favorites) and was told no. Then i hoped for butter chicken as I had seen this item on the on line menu. No, they didn't have that. My husband wanted to order the Tandoori but was told it would take a good 30 minutes. We ended up ordering 2 dishes the waiter suggested. Both were good, but nothing we would have ordered anywhere else. We did get a little vegetable fritter appetizer and lime soda compliments of the house and that was a nice touch. The garlic Nan was also good and service was excellent, other then the no menus and no dishes we wanted, I find the Korma thing odd, since other folks have reviewed this dish and the Butter chicken here. The waiter did say it was their soft opening, but that also seemed odd since they had been open about 2 months. If they move on to their hard opening and run another groupon I'll give them another try. Otherwise I'll drive the extra mile and go to Tarka, where they always have Korma and I don't need a groupon to afford."},{"name":"Wonton Asian Kitchen","address":"1230 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"First time visit last night at Wonton Asian Kitchen my husband and I give it 5 stars we absolutely loved it !

Ask for a bottle of homemade hot sauce if you like things spicy.    I almost always get the chile rellenos with shrimp- it's a great combination.  The best things, however, are the refried beans and rice.  I've never tasted better beans and rice than Roberto's beans and rice.

Or was I expecting too much?\\n\\nBeast was good but not superlative, it had several shortcomings, not only in my eyes but also in the eyes of my dining companions.\\n\\nFirst of all the place is small and it gets loud, the creaky chairs are not very comfortable and the open kitchen is pass√©, however the service is very good, but there is not much service acumen that one needs to pour drinks and deliver prix fix plates.\\n\\nWe all decided to go for the 6 course meal with the wine pairings, the price is reasonable but the portions are small.\\n\\nWe started off with a broccoli soup with pork cracklings and that was paired with a\\nGr√ºner Veltliner, a grape that is grown Wachau district just west of Wein in Austria where I spent many summers during my youth. The soup was rich and good but the pork cracklings overpowered the flavor of the soup and did not pair well with the wine. (3 Stars)\\n\\nWe had the charcuterie plate, which enough people have raved about as was probably the highlight of the evening. (5 stars)\\n\\nAnd then onto the entr√©e of hanger steak, it was good but nothing out of this world, it was paired with a potato and squash gratin with a French blue cheese, again the blue cheese seemed to overpower the gratin and the salsa verde they served with it didn't seem to belong at all on the plate. All of this was paired with a medoc that was good, but I would have gone with a bigger wine to compliment the flavors of the food and the steak. A little more tannin would have gone a long way to cut through the fat and enhance this dish. (3.5 stars)\\n\\nThe salad was good but when we asked if one could be made without the candied bacon we were told that the chef felt this would change the flavor component and refused. This was unacceptable in my mind. Also to pair wine with a salad is a notoriously hard task, they did a good job with a sherry style wine, but I think I would have forgone a wine pairing with this course. (4 stars for the salad - 1 for refusing to take off the bacon = 3 stars)\\n\\nThe cheeses were excellent, the goat Capretta Tenerina was exquisite, but the raisin wine, we all agreed did not go with the cheeses at all, you mouth unfortunately stayed coated with fat, a nice port or perhaps a zin would have been a better pair. (5 Stars)\\n\\nDeserts were just okay, I liked the quince sorbet, the cat's tongues were a little dry and the rose cream was - meh (3 Stars)\\n\\nSo Beast averages about 3.75 stars for the 6 courses."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Alright, Somerville (and surrounding areas) if you haven't tried this place YOU ARE MISSING SOMETHING.

However, the waitress that served us was also serving 4 other high tops and a bunch of smaller high tops (she was running around) so it seemed like a lot of work for one person. We waited 15-20 minutes before we could even ask for the check then it took another 10 minutes for the check to arrive. \\n\\nOther than that the food and drinks were tasty I had the cucumber mojito with gin which had a very interesting but delightful flavor, heavy on the cucumber but could barely taste the ginger beer. \\n\\nWe ordered the $5 bread and butter. Which came with 4 pieces of bread with butter. Too much butter in our opinion. We only got that because we were starving. But would not normally get it. The hamburger was very good. So large that I couldn't pick it up to eat (the bottom was soggy) so I just ate it with a fork and knife. It was still very yummy. The onions were a good complimentary garnish.

I was taking the back roads out to Mt. Hood and making my way through Happy Valley, mentally bookmarking places to try, My wife exclaimed \\"A Pho Restaurant in Happy Valley, WHAT?!\\" Ok, maybe my wife caught me off guard. So we vowed to make time over the weekend to go. I didn't really expect a whole lot from a Vietnamese restaurant in Happy Valley. Not to take away from a handful of good spots around town, but for lack of a better term, Happy Valley isn't known for their \\"cultured\\" foods. \\n\\nUpon entry it was very welcoming, great ambiance. Nice decor. They have a very nice Christmas tree standing there in the middle of the place. I could tell the establishment was clean and well taken care of. The restaurant wasn't cold, or too warm. There were plenty of open booths. Actual Sriracha on the table. I wasn't put off by anything upon visual inspection. We were greeted and seated promptly. Waters were brought to the table short after. I scanned the menu and saw a lot of familiar dishes. I stick to my guns at new places to give it a fair review based on my \\"control\\". Pho -- Tai Nam with meatball. Order of salad rolls. Lets do this. \\n\\nI received my salad rolls pretty close to the same time that the Pho was ready. I only had time to eat 1.5 of the 4 pieces. I did notice they have cabbage in them, that was weird to me. I feel like the cabbage took away from some of the other flavors. I am not a huge fan of \\"undressed\\" cabbage. I feel like it makes things dry. So I drenched that thing in peanut sauce and Sriracha and moved on to my pho. It was nice and hot. The round steak on top was still fresh and rare. I submerged it, took a broth spoonful before I add any condiments and the broth was really excellently done. It had a little of that oily, marrow filled deliciousness I have come to enjoy. Aromatics were great, not too sweet and cinnamon based, it was more on the hearty side. I don't think this place cheaps out on their base ingredients. Everything else about the dish was great, the meatballs were pretty standard, just with less collagen bits of chewiness. Which is a plus in my book. \\n\\nAll in all, I will go again. I had a friend tell me nearly the same exact things about her visit, and she is the one who introduced me to pho in 2001. I would have notched it up to a 4 if they had salad rolls I enjoyed more. They are pretty much a 3.9 as it stands anyhow.

The menu sounds awesome and I always have a hard time deciding what to order. But then the food comes, and I'm always like, this just isn't as good as it should be. Things are either bland, low on the one ingredient I'm most interested in, or simply covered in a sauce that brings a flavor completely mismatched to the dish (I'm looking at you, heuvos rancheros).  Honestly, I can't think of a single dish here that was above average. \\n\\nHighland Kitchen has got such a huge, devoted following, including many of my close friends whose food opinions I trust, but I'm just not sure why.

Given the variety of options for fast food in MetroWest, this is my preferred establishment -- unlike most Pandas, this one has a drive-through, which makes it ridiculously easy for me to go there as a lunch option. So I do. All. The. Time. (I randomly will binge on a certain chain for months at a time for lunch. It's a Thing that I Do.)\\n\\nI would hesitate to call this a traditional Chinese place, too, as anyone who's had good Chinese will tell you, this isn't what you're used to getting at a great takeout place. They purport to be healthier, and sometimes they are, but the overall taste of the food is something very different than what most of us think as 'traditional' Chinese -- it's still quite good though, if you're in a hurry and need something tasty to nom on. They have a lot of options and unlike other chain restaurants, I notice something vaguely new and experimental on the menu every few weeks that I'll randomly try, usually with good results.\\n\\nAgain, I really just use the place for a lunch stop because it's really close to my work and I dig the fresh veggies used in my fav dishes. They're also really quick and friendly there. \\n\\nThe one thing I would NOT recommend trying is the lo mein. It's just... not good. No one I know can stand it. Due to the fact that, at Panda, they don't do the oily, greasy goodness that most Chinese places are very happy to do, the noodles turn out very try and not very flavorful. The fried rice is sub-par, but you can fix that with a dousing of soy.\\n\\nWhat I would recommend: going inside and trying what looks good. They'll just stab whatever you point at with a toothpick and let you sample it.

There was a line outside which I didn't mind and was to be expected and the staff member outside was really friendly and made the wait not so bad. I did hear other guests in line complaining how hot it was and that there was no shade/ cover, which I think if the line was quite long I wouldn't have waited due to that fact. Once inside the line moved quite fast and the staff taking orders seemed helpful quick and efficient and everyone was smiling. My friends and I all had separate orders and got our food to go as we were taking it to the AMC movie theatre to eat while we watched the movie. When our buzzers went off we approached the counter and there were 3 staff members handing out food including one who was in black clothing (I assumed a manager) they did not seem confident they were handing us our correct items and none of them used any of our names which we were asked when placing the orders. I had to ask for my drink which they did not give to me . The staff behind the counter seemed running around not quite organized yet perhaps still getting used to operations. We were given our bags of food and headed into our movie. As we started going through our bags we soon realized that our orders were incomplete. My order was missing the pickle chips I had ordered and the sauces were all labeled incorrectly , they all said ranch but clearly were different sauces, my other friend didn't receive his 3 piece tenders and only had his sandwich and side item . We couldn't go back right away because our movie was starting .. by the time the movie was over we didn't feel like going back to the venue and waiting to get back in and correct the mistakes.

That stuff is magic. Heart stopping, artery clogging, wondrous burger bliss. If I didn't know any better they took a time machine and snatched up the burger joint straight from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. The burger kid can now become the neighborhood celebrity again. \\n\\nThe only real choice here is what kind of toppings do you want on your burger. You're getting beef or french fries and probably both, the easiest answer is you want everything. The latter eludes to all the toppings that come standard like grilled onions, pickle, tomato, mushrooms, mayo, mustard, ketchup and all the fixins. That doesn't even include option free sides like BBQ sauce, A1, or hot sauce. Take your pick, because this is all you've got to consider at 5G. Maybe the tougher choice is Bacon or not to Bacon? Single Patty or Double heart stopper? It's alll good. \\n\\nA quick impression is that none of this is organic or local, and you know what I don't care. It's a guilty pleasure. Back in the day when fast food chains were serving real french fries and burgers they were still serving industrial meat and didn't know any better. Okay, so we know the real deal and they still serve corn fed meat. This is a GUILTY pleasure, a late night rendezvous with colonic catastrophe written all over it. \\n\\nSpeaking of the FRIES! That time machine extends beyond pop-culture back to what places in town used to serve. Fresh Cut fries. Okay, I don't really know if they're fresh cut or if those big giant bag of \\"fresh\\" fries they line the dining room with are actually pre-cut with the skin on, but they're amazingly good. Incredibly convincing all warm and hot in a brown paper bag and they want to give you these fries. I ordered the regular, which is the small, and got it to go with my Bacon burger. I watched as they prepared 3 orders ahead a me at the end of the line. \\n\\nStep 1. Fill fry cup. \\n\\nStep 2. Add foil wrapped burger to bag \\n\\nStep 3. Dump a serious helping of remaining french fries into bag and top with a napkin. \\n\\n\\nIn your burger dreams, we all have those right, it's the common sense of finishing an order. On the drive home there was the perfect amount of fries to pick without seeming like I had eaten the whole serving. brilliant. \\n\\nAs my heart slogs to keep up with my typing now, I'll clear the grease from my fingers and just say that this is a special treat. Oddly enough the diners seem to know that. Here is this joint where you definitely do NOT eat there every day without consequence and yet nearly everyone in the building was in rather decent shape. The place was packed and there wasn't one slothic person in the building. Everyone carefully calculated by my internal judging monologue was old school European fat at best. Which if you don't know means that they were all slender with the tiniest bit of baby fat. Not too many people had six packs under their jackets, but no one, not one single person was going to be able to audition for the biggest loser. Well, maybe if they had just begun their scheme of weight gain prior to the show. Euro-fat for short. \\n\\nWhat I'm getting at is most people it seemed takes Five Guys Burgers and Fries in stride. Eat it moderately, enjoy it like a rare wine, raw blowfish, or street vendor eggs in Thailand and you'll have proof that guilty pleasures don't have to cost an arm and a leg. Maybe they just cost a little plaque on the super highway of your red blood cells.

I am less to ask questions and will stray away from certain items if I am unsure because of it. The person taking our order picked up on the fact that I like to avoid gluten, and even let me know which items were not listed as gluten free on their menu simply because they shared a fryer with other items.

I'm sure my husband is sick and tired of me raving about their salad rolls (I think they call them spring rolls here though), but they often come up in conversation. I've had many a rice-paper roll before, but these are on another level. The tofu used is a pillowy, inch-thich substance that really adds a pleasant texture to the roll. Some places slice it thin and marinate it; no thank you. This is back to basics: fresh herbs, quality tofu, and rice paper. I also ordered pho and it was equally incredible. The broth was fresh, the beef pieces weren't fatty, and there were plenty of noodles. I also found it nice that they didn't overload me with pho toppings.

Now usually when I write a review and say that I didn't like the food it was because the food was insipid and the service lousy.\\n\\nThat was not the case at Ping! \\n\\nThe food was well prepared, tasty and the service attentive.\\n\\nBest I can figure is a culinary bias against Thai food. I eat at a lot of Thai restaurants because my wife and friends like Thai food and usually I'm happy with salad rolls and Thai beef salad neither of which are on Ping's menu. To be honest I'd prefer to eat at a Vietnamese restaurant over Thai any day.\\n\\nNow that you know my biases let's look at the meal.\\n\\nFirst Ping is not your typical Thai restaurant. There wasn't an order of Pad Thai Noodles to be found on the lunch menu. Ping specializes in Thai street food so it tends to be lots of simple single bowl dishes. If your only exposure to Thai food is places like Thai Orchid your in for a treat.\\n\\nWe ordered two two entr√©es and three appetizers.\\n\\nSpice House Roasted Red Peanuts: These peanuts are a house favorite and are really quite good. Yes I might have like a little more lime leaf flavor and maybe a little spicier but overall they were tasty and well balanced. I'd definitely order them again.\\n\\nSalapao: This is a Thai style steamed bun stuffed with shredded pork. Its very similar in to the dim sum steamed buns that you see all over Portland but the pork is not BBQ flavored. You can actually taste the pork in the bun and it doesn't glow in the dark. The Salapoa is a little on the bland side so they serve it with a condiment tray that has three different types of chillies. A Thai chili in a salty fish sauce, a Serrano chili in a sour vinegary liquid and the typical crushed red peppers. Both the Serrano and Thai chilies added a nice zing to the buns. Definite reorder.\\n\\nKopitiam Toast: Of all the food we had this was my least favorite. But I should admit that I really dislike coconut in any form other than shredded. Kopitiam has an insipidly sweet coconut jam on top. That said the toast was crisp and the jam smooth and creamy, it just isn't my cup of tea. My lunch partner said that the dried chili added a lot to the toast, I don't know as I couldn't bring myself to try a second piece.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Ping hasn't updated their website to reflect their new menu so I don't have the names of the entr√©es that we had so I will have to describe them as best as I can.\\n\\nMy lunch partner ordered ordered the first item on the lunch menu and said that he had made the dish several times from different recipes and found it to be well executed. My lunch partner is an on again off again Portland cook/caterer and has eaten and cooked a lot of Thai food so when he waxes eloquently about how good the food is I believe him. (He plans on going back to Ping and working his way down the menu item by item.)\\n\\nI had an entr√©e about four or five items down the list. The easiest way to identify it was that it is described as being served dry with broth on the side or as a soup. I ordered it as a soup. It was good with just the right sour overtones to make it interesting. The dish is described as spicy and I suppose it was for the average American but I ask for some of the yummy house chili sauce to spice it up.\\n\\nIf I had a complaint about my dish it was that it was served a little too tepid for my tastes. I like my soup served hot and steaming but this was neither when it got to the table and barely warm by the time I was half way through it and I'm not a slow eater. I didn't finish my soup as I don't much care for tepid soup. Ping needs to warm their plates or make sure that the soup is hotter when served.\\n\\nOne other thing that should be mentioned. Ping is not an inexpensive place to eat we dropped over $40 for a lunch for two and one of the soup bowls has a big chip in the rim of the bowl. This is inexcusable for a restaurant of Pings stature.\\n\\nI didn't find Ping to be particularly exciting but it is definitely a solid 3.5-4/5 and I would certainly recommend it to someone looking for good Thai street food. But remember my culinary bias probably affects my enthusiasm."},{"name":"Pizza Days","address":"111 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"2","text":"We ordered food over almost two hours ago, and it's still not here.

I ordered their traditional turkey meal and the waitress was horrible.  She didn't bring our drinks once she took our orders and the salads came out almost along with the dinner we requested.  The turkey had a strange taste and very bland.  It was rubbery on the edges and was not eatable.  The dressing was extremely bland as was the mashed potatoes.  I asked for two containers of cranberry sauce to mask the taste of this meal.  That didn't help.  The filthy kitchen actually took away my appetite so  this was just a horrible experience.  The other Toojays we visited in the mall stunk so badly, once we walked in, we turned and walked out.  The service at this location on Colonial was just ridiculous.

My mentee and I were seated rather quickly and received fantastic service. The same young lady who greeted the both of us was also our waitress. The suggestions and recommendations soothed our palette. I ordered the chicken and black bean nachos and the hot chicken sandwich. I really appreciate Melton's App and Tapp's concept of melted cheese. Unlike other restaurants, Melton's App and Tapp uses fresh melted cheese not cheez whiz from a can. The nachos portion is huge, possibly good enough to feed four people. The hot chicken sandwich was great. The bun definitely tasted as if it was baked in house and the chicken was cooked just right and juicy. Fantastic. The service and food was good enough reason to come back.\\n\\n10/25/12\\nI walked in and was looking forward to eat at Melton's App and Tapp for lunch. Unfortunately, after walking in not one person greeted me. One or two minutes later another woman walks into the establishment after me and was immediately greeted and seated at a table. I stood around waiting for someone to either seat me or give me some instruction. Finally after five minutes the bartender tells me 'you can seat yourself'. Kind of funny since there is a 'please wait to be seated' sign in front of the bartender. As I sat down I waited another few minutes in hopes someone from the wait staff would get me a menu. Yes! Finally, an older woman handed me a menu with a glare. Awesome.  A great way to start the afternoon. I placed my order and shortly after the food arrived at the table. Not one person from the wait staff checked to see how I was doing. The table behind me was checked on a couple times while I was eating. I tried to get the waitress' attention but instead, I got up out of my seat to grab napkins, utensils, and an extra plate. Ridiculous. After I paid I spoke to management about my poor experience.  The manager on duty apologized and assured the specific wait staff providing the poor customer service would be addressed. He offered to 'take my tab' but since I already paid there was 'nothing he could do'. What a bold lie. I had restaurants and service companies reverse charges when I dispute poor services and product after I paid the same day. I walked out and wanted to give this place one more chance.\\n\\n11/28/12\\nThe third experience was similar if not worse than the second time. I walked in wanting to place a to go order and knew exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately, a few people needed to be seated before I had the privilege of placing an order. I guess the wait staff thought I was not as hungry as the other patrons. Again dirty looks and an unwelcome vibe. The bartender was very nice. Sadly, his wait staff colleagues are a poor reflection of him.\\n\\nMelton's App and Tapp is usually not packed. I do not understand why they choose to delay me service. After little thought and observation I came to a conclusion. I notice certain wait staff will provide better service to those similar to their complexion. Melton's App and Tapp claims they treat customers like family, only if you look like them. Honestly, I have received better customer service from McDonald's and Wal-Mart.

Quality of service seems to vary widely by location based upon Yelp postings.  There are standard brick and mortar operations that have counter service and seating similar to a host of other burger joints across the nation.  \\nMy very first experience was at the Burgerville location near the convention center in Portland.  Service was slow, seating was scarce, business was brisk.\\nThe highlight was their milkshake which was one of the best I have ever had a burger joint.\\n\\nMy first experience with this airport location was on my flight back home, these are my impressions:\\n\\nLocated in Concourse D, only one in the airport.\\n\\nThey are the only Burgerville  location to sell a Burgerville hydro flask like container called fifty/fifty. $25 includes any shake including the specialty ones. The flask comes in several different colors and holds 18 oz.  \\n\\nThe regular burgers are suppose to use 100% natural beef.  On the thin side but delicious.  They also use a secret sauce that reminds me of the old (and now long gone) Burgerland  burgers in Honolulu ( a reminder for all you old futs out there). \\n\\nBought a burger and drink to eat here at the airport, also bought the flask and filled it with a Marionberry shake to take home.  Wanted to see how cold the shake would stay on a flight back to Hawaii.  The workers were confident it would stay cold.  The most popular shake is the dark chocolate ganache flavor. (Maybe I should have tried that one since it's available for a limited time only) \\n\\n(Their walla walla onion rings are suppose to be special and that is something I want to try next time.  They also use seasonal and locally grown fruits for their shakes.) \\n\\nThere is a worker who takes the order and payment via a tablet device, this procedure is pretty efficient.  The staff is friendly and helpful, the wait time is a little longer than say, a Burger King or McDs, but the grub is tastier. \\n\\nThe food is good, but the shakes are better.

It seems more popular lately, maybe due to their revising prices downward in recent months. You can get a ton of food for the $9-13 range, and while it's not the best Mexican you've ever had, it's certainly not the worst, unless you've ever braved the menudo in a New Mexico border town.\\n\\nThe wait staff here are a bit of an enigma. There's one guy who I swear is an out-of-work Mexican B-list movie actor, and another who seems permanently flustered and runs everywhere in a mad panic. They talk to each other in rapid-fire Spanish at the bar. It's really quite a spectacle.\\n\\nHowever, the energy to efficiency ratio can fluctuate wildly. The tortilla chips and salsa that theoretically come gratis for every table can take forever to arrive, or sometimes not show up at all. Same for water, which is generally a staple of Mexican restaurants.\\n\\nI feel like two stars is a little harsh for La Casita, but three is too many; it's not as if they get it wrong, it's just nothing to write a corrido about. Overall the food is a bit bland, lacking the feistiness that one would expect from authentic Mexican. I understand not everyone handles spicy food well, but there are ways to infuse flavour intensity without resorting to gastronomic sadism. I only wish the chefs would find such a way, because I really want to like this place more than I do.\\n\\nThe vintage Mexican cimema over the bar is a nice touch - seeing flabby lucre libra dudes getting beat up while you defeat your enchilada is an oddly compelling experience, while at the same time reminding you not to eat too much cheese.

This turned all three of our stomachs and our breakfasts went just about untouched. We informed the server, who informed the manager, and both tried to make light of the situation, joking that \\"sometimes maggots get into bags of quinoa.\\" They didn't charge my friend for his food, but sadly two of the uneaten earth bowls were still on our bill.

Lo and behold, I came back a few weeks ago (for drinks ONLY) and was told by the bouncer that VIP cards were not being used that night, and I had to go to the back of the line.

My fiance isn't as adventurous eater as I am so he didn't care for a few things on the plate. I loved the steak tartare quail egg toast. We both thought the squab breast and pork terrine was ok. The foie gras bon-bon with sauternes gelee was the highlight of the plate. Great texture and the flavor of the gelee was just perfect. Wish I could have had two of those!\\nOur main course was a porcini rubbed Carman Ranch striploin which was cooked perfectly. It was served with potatoes cooked in duck fat (yum!) and served with winter greens and a black garlic hollandaise sauce. This dish honestly felt a little over-salted to me, I think it was mostly the greens. The striploin and the potatoes were just right though.\\nThe next course was a shaved fennel, pink grapefruit and blood orange salad with smoked steelhead roe and a creamy beet vinaigrette. Absolutely delicious. The vinaigrette was something else, would have loved the recipe for it. The smoked steelhead roe added perfectly to the dish.\\nThe cheese course was also delicious, all of our cheeses were made from cow's milk. Our brie was like butter, wish I would have written down the name of it. The second cheese (can't quite remember what it was) had the most interesting tang to it. My fiance hated it but I loved it paired with the honey and crackers. The third cheese was an unpasteurized cheese which we both could have done without, it was too mild for both us. The plate as a whole was really good though.\\nWe both didn't think we'd have room for dessert but once we tasted the bourbon barrel aged maple pot de creme with caramel, hazelnuts and whipped creme fraiche, we made room. The dessert was the perfect ending to a delicious meal for sure.\\nEven though we had a few minor \\"misses\\" to our meal, overall we were incredibly impressed with the food being put out by Beast.

Not because I'm tired but because I think I ate too much.  Surprisingly, I didn't even finish my food, which is rare for me.  Talk about getting a lot of bang for your buck, $6 goes very far here!  For that price, you get one protein and two sides with a drink.  For me, I chose to go with the pulled chicken over rice, mashed potatoes with gravy and macaroni and cheese.  Thankfully, cornbread comes with the meal as well, so that's a huge plus for me since I can't envision eating a southern meal without it.  Like Chris Rock says, \\"cornbread, ain't nothin' wrong with that!\\"  \\n\\nOverall, the food was okay, not bad but not great either.  With places like these, I feel that the focus is more on the bargain rather than serving high quality food and that's alright because I felt that'd be the case going in.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was seasoned just right.  It paired well with the rice, as the rice didn't absorb all of the juice, so the integrity of the texture was kept intact throughout.  The mashed potatoes were okay, they weren't clumpy or runny, but somewhere in between.  I got the impression that they may have been instant mashed potatoes but I could be wrong.  The macaroni, well, not much was going on there.  Although it was bland, it did have some creaminess to it.  To my surprise, the cornbread was decent, it wasn't dry and there was no flaking.  Quite tasty.\\n\\nFor the interior, it had the old school feel to it, like a diner that you'd encounter in the middle of the country.  For service, there was only one lady working the line, however, she was very nice and moved quickly.  She also served generous portions, so that's a huge plus.  For drinks, I believe there are two options, sweet tea and lemonade.  I'm a tea kind of guy, preferably unsweet, but settled for the sweet this time around.  The tea was not bad, didn't taste sugary at all, which is quite shocking for me as a lot of places get carried away with the sugar.  They may serve soda, but I don't recall seeing a fountain.  So what's the verdict?  With a bargain price, generous portions, and fast service, I can definitely see myself coming back here again."},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Not bad, but have had better.

First they brought me a salad when I had ordered none, and then took 5 minutes to figure out it was my sister in laws grandmothers salad, which she had been patiently waiting for. My husband and I ordered the mussels as our app. First one was good, second one... A big mouthful of sand. I've worked with plenty of seafood, I know it happens even in the most fine of dining establishments. Third one... More copious bits of crunchy sand... I gave up and was nauseated by the bowl of remaining mussels staring back at me, taunting me with their grit. I tasted just a bit of the broth...  *sandy*. I was mortified to have been served this, especially at that price point. I've had better p.e.i. Mussels in a strip mall restaurant in chicago. You have to let them rest in fresh water for a while for them to remove the sand they accumulate. these tasted as though they were living in sand up until being plated. Moving on, I ordered the Scottish salmon and as I'm allergic to shrimp asked if I could get extra crab with my \\"topping choice\\" instead of the standard crab/shrimp/hollandaise. No problem! I'm happy with that, the salmon comes out only slightly overcooked, but seasoned well, and nary a shrimp in sight. It's big too! I could only finish about a third of my entire plate (I was still a little grossed out from the sand I couldn't get out of my mouth without looking like I was having a stroke at the table) and I asked for it to be boxed up, and received a neat box labelled \\"salmon\\" with our check.. Which the waiters only messed up entirely, twice. I wake up the next day hoping to use my salmon and crab with some duck eggs and make a nice omelette.. I hobble into the kitchen tired and hungry, my appetite finally revived from a night of forgiving yesterday for its shortcomings and fantasizing about duck eggs with Scottish salmon and crab. I reach in the fridge and quickly grab the box marked salmon and the eggs, an onion, some Amish butter. Fumble for a pan and manage to work the knob on the stove to make it work it's magic on my soon to be delicious breakfast. I Saut√©e my onions in the magic Amish butter and place them aside, I crack open these delicious farm duck eggs... I reach for the box with focused anticipation at this point, open it, and discover someone else's food.

SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS PLACE!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is extremely popular and I can see why. Tasty n Sons is seriously delicious and lives up to all the hype around it in Portland. I haven't yet tried their dinner menu, but I've been here numerous times for brunch...and most importantly, happy hour! As a disclaimer, my 5-star rating of this place is primarily based on my experiences here during happy hour.\\n\\nWalking into the restaurant, there is a front section with shared counter seating, shared table seating, and a bar. In the back, there is the kitchen and more traditional seating (I believe they're regular booths, not shared seating). Given that I've only dined here in the earlier part of the day, I haven't yet sat in the back. I'm not too sure why? I am not a huge fan of shared seating and this is my only gripe with this place.\\n\\nService here is always great. The servers will explain to you, if it's your first time here, that plates at Tasty n Sons are meant to be shared. As much as I love certain dishes and want them all to myself, I also think it's best to share dishes so that you can try more things on the menu! \\n\\nAs I said earlier, I've been here a lot, especially for happy hour. I haven't been to that many HHs in Portland, but this one is my current favorite. Cocktails are $7, which isn't the best HH price around, but are very tasty. Their creamsicle fizz cocktail with white rum, orange juice, cream vanilla phosphate (which makes it a little tangy), and orange bitters really tastes like a creamsicle! So creamy and so orangy. Yum.\\n\\nFood prices for HH range from $1 for their bacon-wrapped dates up to $8 for a burger. They offer 12 items in total for HH from 2:30 - 5:00 pm. My top three dishes they have for HH are:\\n\\n1) Polenta n Sausage Ragu ($6) - Hands down my favorite dish. Their polenta is soft, rich, and pairs perfectly with a generous layer of mozzarella on the top. Their ragu is just as delicious and a bit lighter, as to not overpower the other flavors in the dish. Coupled with an over-easy egg on the top adding more richness to the dish, this dish is simply perfection. It's also quite big for $6. Highly recommended.\\n\\n2) Radicchio ($6) - I originally got this dish because I felt like I needed something fresh with my meal. I'm really glad that I tried it, as this is a staple HH dish for me. Radicchio does have a slightly bitter taste, which some may not like (my boyfriend's not a fan), but I think that bitterness is well balanced out by a creamy dressing and tons of parmesan. The croutons are also yummy and remind me of less salty cheetos.\\n\\n3) Pretty Damn Good Chicken Strips ($7) with crinkle fries - I know chicken strips might be a bit boring, but these are definitely damn good chicken strips! They're a bit lighter and less oily than most chicken strips, which I definitely appreciate. The chicken is moist, juicy, and breaded well. The side of ranch dipping sauce is also great and the crinkle fries are well seasoned and crispy. \\n\\nIf you come during brunch, I highly recommend getting their Steak & Cheddar Eggs with a cornmeal pancake and jalapeno butter ($16). This is seriously fire stuff. The steak is cooked perfectly medium-rare and is finished with a wonderful chunkier salt for seasoning. The cornmeal pancake is soft, fluffy, and has that great sweet corn taste that I'm looking for. Coupled with fluffy eggs, generously coated with a layer of cheddar, and a jalapeno butter that brings everything together, this dish is a must try.  \\n\\nTLDR: It's such a treat to come here. Everything is so flavorful, tasty, and well presented. Food takes a little bit to come out, but it's worth the wait. Go during HH for some sweet deals! \\n\\nPS: Their bacon wrapped dates are really delicious. It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty. The bacon is caramelized well and matches the flavor of the date well. For $1 during HH, try it out!"},{"name":"Megabite Granville","address":"1005 Granville St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"OK pizza for the price, particularly on cheap Tuesday's but be aware they charge you an extra fee if you use credit card to pay.\\n\\nI prefer going to Uncle Fatih's pizza a couple blocks up the Street on Nelson"},{"name":"49 Social","address":"49 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The food was great!

I also loved the chalkboard wall behind us - I need one of these for my kitchen for sure.\\n\\nI could tell a lot of the people who were sitting at the bar were regulars and the bartender even asked if we wanted to put our names on the waitlist for a barstool... that was definitely a new one to me. We didn't even feel comfortable standing near the one open barstool for fear of breaking another rule. We decided not to put our name on the bar list since we wanted to sit and eat - being on two lists felt a little excessive. Despite the 40 minute estimate to be seated it only took about 15 minutes to actually get a table which was an excellent surprise.\\n\\nOne of the most disappointing parts of the Highland Kitchen was their limited beer selection. They only had about 6 beers on tap and since they were all heavier beers or IPAs there was nothing for me to drink. I decided to go with a cider, which was delivered to me in a can... At that point I wanted to recommend we leave, but I'm glad I gave it a second chance (I had to since I was going to write a review...)\\n\\nWe had a trio of hummus to start with pita bread which was good (well 2/3 were). There was a spicy, tomato based hummus that was fantastic, but the other red hummus wasn't great and the standard hummus was average. They did refresh the pita bread when we ran out which I really appreciated and isn't something restaurants are always willing to do. When I proposed dinner I had been craving a burger all day and I had heard that the Highland Kitchen offered a great burger. It looks pretty plain based on the menu, but I do have to say it was cooked perfectly and well proportioned. If I had to do a taste test with most other burgers I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference, but it hit the spot. My date had the pulled pork and he said it was delicious - since I'm not a fan I had to take his word for it!\\n\\nAll in all I had a good experience at the Highland Kitchen and would go back (although I'd probably try something else from their very diverse menu). If people asked me what the best restaurant in Somerville is it probably wouldn't be my answer, but I wouldn't tell people NOT to go there either.

The restaurant is most definitely NOT an appropriate place to bring screaming-aged children, so this was somewhat offputting.\\n\\nHowever, we tried not to let this interfere with our relaxing Sunday evening dinner, and fortunately the rest of the evening rocked.  We both started with a glass of Lambrusco, then enjoyed a caesar salad which had a touch too much dressing, but otherwise was nice and flavorful. The bread and oil that are provided are excellent. The crust is crusty enough but not too crusty, and the inside of the bread has a nice texture that is good to soak up the oil.\\n\\nI then decided to enjoy the tortelli di mele and the husband had the lobster ravioli. The tortelli di mele is one of their signature dishes, and for me, it certainly didn't disappoint. The sausage and pasta combination combined with the creamy cheese texture and the sweet apple flavors were absolutely perfect. My husband also thought the lobster ravioli was some of the best he has ever eaten.\\n\\nThe only other slight piece of improvement that could be made would be to the service, as they seemed overworked and trying to tend to too many tables with very few of them, and seemed frazzled as they scurried about, but we were still in and out quickly and with tasty and well-prepared food, so it seems to work for them.\\n\\nWe wouldn't hesitate to go back and look forward to using our other gift certificate next weekend!"},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"was staying at an airbnb within walking distance and checked this place out with my sister.

The entire menu is based on wholesome food and has a variety of options for any type of lifestyle preference. As a nutrition major, this place seemed liked the perfect fit. \\n\\nFood: \\nI know the Mother Earth bowl is quite popular, but I decided to go with the mix and match veggie sides (3 for $9) and added steak for $6. I chose the grilled asparagus, broccoli with parmesean, and indian spiced cauliflower. The broccoli was meh... a bit of regret as it was nothing special and in a way, a waste of a side. The asparagus was delicious, but the star was that cauliflower. WOW, absolutely mouth-watering. It had the perfect amount of spice and the roasting on it was perfection. Definitely inspired me to try and recreate it at home! The steak, however, was not up to par. The menu says that it is cooked to medium, but my steak was definitely medium well - there was little to no pink in the meat, which made it slightly tough + chewy to eat. The portion was also TINY for $6 - definitely overpriced. \\n\\nService: \\nYou order at the counter, receive a number, and they bring the food to you. A quite casual atmosphere in comparison to their menu, but it made the place light hearted! The staff were all super friendly and always checked on us to ask us if we needed anything or could help clear our plates. Superb! \\n\\nAtmosphere: \\nVery \\"aesthetic\\", which attracts a lot of customers. We came in on a saturday night at 7:30pm and it was definitely packed! I loved seeing the open kitchen + sitting area. Everything was accessible and cozy. \\n\\nDefinitely a great place to try out, especially for a nice lunch option with friends over the weekend. I wholeheartedly agree with their menu focus, but it is quite pricey. I wouldn't come here as often, since I know that I can make the same type of food (honestly, an exact replica), for a lot cheaper. A lot of establishments similar to Flower Child are on the pricier side, which saddens me a little since \\"healthy\\" food does not have to be that expensive - however, it is nice to not cook once in awhile and enjoy a freshly prepared delicious meal. \\n\\nAll in all, would come again!

The colors and layout (lots of close or even shared tables) give the restaurant a warm feel. There's a lot of noise, but I enjoy that in a restaurant. \\n\\nWhat I didn't like: The wait. When we got there, we were told that there would be a 45 min to 1 hour wait, which is on the longer end, but we decided to wait. That said, there was some kind of miscommunication between the host and the bartender that resulted in four couples that came well after us getting seated before us. The host was incredibly apologetic, but it was just a little frustrating because we ended up waiting the full time even though we could have been seated earlier. \\n\\nThe miscommunication aside, waiting that long for a meal is not something I do often. We got there around 5:45 and by the time we were seated, the wait times went well over an hour. In the larger parties, it was close to two.

The food arrived and when i thought things couldn't get any worse.(now note its not that big of a deal but if i order something and i pay for it i expect to get what i ordered) My boyfriend ordered shrimp fried rice and only got fried rice with no shrimp so he calls and tells them the lady had a strong accent so it was hard for us to understand what she was saying but from what i heard it sounded like she said since we got a small size it doesnt come with it or something along those lines and i said....... it says shrimp fried rice SHRIMP fried rice! there is no excuse to not give me something you advertised. She starts yelling at us and at that point my boyfriend hung up on her because we werent going to deal with poor customer service. Mind you we werent rude or anything we just simply asked why there wasnt shrimp in our rice and constantly telling her to repeat herself because we couldn't understand. She lashed out at us for no reason and it was really surprising to me because i dont care if im the rudest customer in the world you don't treat people this way especially when your in the wrong.

Where might we get some close to where we were at the time that we were thinking about having pizza?  I pulled out my phone and did a quick search and one of the first was UFO Pizza.  The reviews looked good.  The pictures of the pies looked good.  We were on it.  \\n\\nThe place was pretty quiet on a lazy Saturday in the early evening hours.  We walked right in and ordered our pie and took a seat at the very interesting picnic tables out front.  More on the very interesting part in a bit.  Interesting menu here.  First off you have 2 size choices for pizza.  The medium is $18 and the large is $24.  They do not price each pie separately.  Two prices.  What you choose is up to you.  They allowed us to split our pie in half.  Two different kinds on one pizza for $24.  The large is a very nice size.  We went with half Galaxy (Pepperoni, Sausage, Bell Pepper and Onion) and half Space Cowboy (Tangy BBQ Sauce, Chicken Breast, Bacon, Pepperoncini and Red Onion).\\n\\nLet us take a step back for a moment.  I usually like to try the plain slice before I try anything else at a pizza place I'm going to for the first time, but this meal was Sue's choice so she was the one choosing.  Both sounded good to me and I was quite happy to eat this pizza.\\n\\nWe waited about 15 minutes or so and our very big pizza came out to us.  The Space Cowboy was packed with toppings.  I'm quite surprised the slice stayed intact for most of the ride.  Sign of a good crust.  This pizza is NY style.  Not quite what you would get in NY, but a good representation for Portland, OR.  Sue and I each had 2 slices and we took the rest home for lunch the next day.  It held up well and was quite tasty cold.\\n\\nBack to the picnic tables.  I'm not sure how they haven't fallen apart.  It was like a see saw.  Any time I got up, Sue on the other side of the table dropped a few inches.  I forgot a few times and got up quickly.  Needless to say she wasn't very happy with me.  I had to announce when I was about to stand up so that she in turn could stand up.  Side note to UFO management.  You might want to invest in some new tables.\\n\\nHappy to try another pizza shop in town.  Happy that it was pretty good.

My husband and I have stocked up on the Weasel Rodeo and were able to snag one Whiskey Rodeo prior to it disappearing into oblivion. We have also been to a couple of the Jester King events at local restaurants and had a blast. They poured us beer after beer of everything we loved and we were able to have an awesome meal with our bounty of beer provided. Each event made us feel like well-dressed vikings in better shape.  \\n\\nBut this review is for the brewery itself, the tour, and the on site pizzeria. We have been on the tour a handful of times. Once before with our infant and we loved it. How could we not? Our favorite beer, outdoor games, and a beautiful country atmosphere. \\n\\nWe decided to spend this Saturday at the Brewery. We live in Round Rock, so it was about an hour drive for us, therefore we figured it would be a partial day commitment.\\n\\nWe arrived at the brewery, and after purchasing our drink card ($20 for the two of us), we saw that there were very long lines for each tent and for the tap room, as usual, and decided to wait in line and get our favorite selection first (Weasel Rodeo). When we got to the front of the line, we ordered our beer servings. When our glasses were handed to us, we looked in shock at the miniscule amount of beer we had been given. Surely, this was some sort of mistake. Every time we had been there prior, we at least got half a glass to maybe even 3/4 of a glass of brew for each beer selection - this time, it looked like a couple shots tops. We stood in line for nothing. What was the point of standing in ridiculous lines for shots of beer?\\n\\nA pizzeria had been built on the property, which sells bottles of beer. We glanced at the lines for the tour and decided that we should just say \\"screw it\\" to the $20 we already spent on our drink card and just get a pizza and a bottle of beer. \\n\\nAgain, we wait in line, but no issue there. We ordered our pizza and the staff person was amazingly friendly, even ran to grab *the last* bottle of Weasel Rodeo for us. She told us they were no longer brewing it and that our wait for our pizza (the Ferdinand - about $17) would be an hour. \\n\\nWe speculated on why the tasting portions had changed. After talking to the staff member about the discontinuation of Weasel Rodeo, we decided that maybe the serving was small for only that beer in particular, but larger for the others.  I spoke with some girls who were next to us who just got their beer from the beer tents - apparently the serving was tiny for all of the beers. Totally not worth the $20, long lines, and hipsters.  I guess it was more profitable for Jester King to offer smaller samples of beer so that people who have done the tour before will just shell out $18/bottle and still enjoy the scenery. \\n\\nWe waited an hour - played with our infant, fed her, and drank our $18 bottle of sweet goodness. The only tables open were the ones next to the Airstream port-a-potty. We would randomly smell a terrible odor when the wind blew just right - but the place was so packed, there was really nowhere else to go. After the hour, my husband went to check on the pizza - another 15 minutes and it would be ready. He ordered us a pint of beer each. By this point, we had been at Jester King for a little over an hour and a half to maybe two hours. We were supposed to have plans after, but we quickly realized after the hour wait for pizza that was not going to happen. \\n\\nOur infant started to get tired. My husband decided to stand next to the pizzeria, just in case they called our name and we couldn't hear it. Once our pizza was finally ready (about 30 minutes later), we thought our ordeal was over. My husband wasn't given any napkins and there weren't any to speak of near the pizzeria. I grabbed a slice of pizza - all of the contents, including the cheese, fell off leaving only a greasy, triangular piece of bread. I had to scoop the pizza contents from the box with my hand and sort of pile them on the pizza. I tried again - same thing happened. With my 3-4 slices of the small pizza, I had to wrangle the ingredients back on the pizza with no napkin in site for my hands then covered in food. I got desperate and used baby butt wipes. The pizza was good, but not good enough to have to reassemble after over an hour and a half long wait. My husband and I were still pretty hungry since we had waited all day to eat. We were so desperate for maybe a little more pizza that he grabbed his credit card and some cash to try to bribe the staff to give him *any* unclaimed pizza. No success. We left, out $75 (including tips) with one very tired infant who had been a darn good sport, and feeling very disappointed by the whole ordeal. The beer I would rate 4-5 stars (depending on the beer), the pizza a 3 (4 in taste, 2 in presentation and structure), the waits 2, and the servings were definitely 1-2.

The food has always been great and this one waitress that has been there for a long time has always been very friendly and nice. \\n\\nI went to Noodle Street few days ago. My brother was the first one to get there so I asked him to order me a Tom Yum Soup while I was making my way. When I got there I ordered my main course. The soup came and it was a large one with noodle and everything. I told the waiter I wanted a smaller one and was it possible to switch to that since I also ordered another main course. I didn't want the soup as my main course. Granted we didn't clarify and it was partly our fault. She understood and brought it back. She came back from the kitchen with \\"we can't replace it!\\" \\n\\nConsidering I go there all the time I figured they could make an exception once. I asked for a manager and the waitress that has been there for a very long time knew we were a regular there. She took it to bring it back since it's only good customer service. \\n\\nThis another old woman from the kitchen came out and started screaming in the restaurant in front of everyone. It was very unprofessional and after going there for all these years we've decided to never go back there again. As a business owner myself I refuse to promote something like this. I am not upset that they couldn't make that adjustment but I am very upset over the old woman's lack of professionalism. \\n\\nThe food is great but it's not something you can't get anywhere else.

When we walked in to the restaurant without a reservation, there was nobody waiting around for a table and she stared at her book for 10 mins before looking up and  acknowledging us. She said we would have to wait 10 minutes for a table. No biggie, but  we mentioned we saw a couple of open tables outside and preferred outside seating, and she goes \\"really? Let me know if you see anything open.\\" First off isn't that your one job as a hostess? Second off , we already told her there were multiple open tables! Yet she still wouldn't sit us down. From the beginning she was very rude to us but I dismissed it because I thought that's just her personality. A few minutes later,  a couple of guys walk in and she puts on a huge smile and  is all friendly and greets them right away. We heard them say didn't have a reservation either just like us. So we finally get the hostess's  attention again to take her outside to show her the open tables and there is one table that seats 4 which was ready for seating, cleaned and had table cloth on,  and one table that seats 2 which didn't have a have a table cloth on and wasn't ready and cleaned. So we say, can we just sit here at the table that seats 4 (we were 2 people) and she said very rudely \\"no we want to save that for 4 people.\\" I understand that so I was like ok, no problem. As we wait for the table to be cleaned off for the 2 person table, hostess immediately comes back with the 2 guys who walked in right after us with no reservations and seats them down at the 4 person table that's as all ready. I'm still giving  the hostess the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe a couple of more people are going to join these guys later on, but nope it was just them 2.

We were curious about this restaurant with communal tables, an inflexible market-driven set menu, a name implying some interesting meats and two seatings a night.\\n\\nWe arrived just a little early for the 6pm seating to find about half the dinner crowd already seated.  As we found later, arriving early for the later seating is a mistake ( they play it really close with turning the tables ), but arriving early for the early seating seems to be just fine, and may give you a better choice of seats.  We were in fact offered a choice of sitting inside at the shared communal tables or at a small table out on the sidewalk.  It's not that we're adverse to shared tables - we do that all the time - but the wonderful summer weather drew us outdoors.\\n\\nThey have a reasonable wine list, and a selection of beers that includes quite a few Belgians.  The wine pairing is an excellent deal in comparison to a bottle from the list, and my companion chose the pairing while I had a nice saison.  Though we were seated outdoors, out of sight and presumably out of mind, service was friendly and relatively attentive.\\n\\nThe first course, a soup, was strongly flavored and well-balanced, though my companion complained of the saltiness.  The charcuterie plate which followed was probably the hilight of the meal for us, bearing many small tastes of cured and processed meats and accompaniments including a heavenly foie gras bon-bon topped with a little cube of sauternes gelee.\\n\\nOur main dish of duck was well prepared but unmemorable, as was the following arugula salad course with cherries and blue cheese.  The plated cheese course was excellent, though quite small.  A dessert of dark pecan caramel cakes topped with peach ice cream and coulis was a fine finish, until it developed that my companion's portion was burnt.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a very pleasant evening.  Beast appears to be trying to do a lot with a small staff, a small space and a small kitchen.  They are, for the most part, succeeding.  We were served some very good things, especially the wonderful charcuterie plate.  It seems to me, though, that mistakes such as my companion's burnt dessert are much more likely to happen when you are cooking and plating the same course for a whole restaurant at the same time.  Quality can very easily suffer.\\n\\nBeast is asking a lot of their customers.  Communal tables, more than usually inflexible menus and two set seatings are all concessions from the customer to the restaurant, and they can be made worth it.  Or not.  I am not quite seeing the value to the customer being delivered either through the quality of the food, the uniqueness of the experience, or the price of the menu."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was not really impressed by this restaurant.

You would only describe the atmosphere of this place as quant, cute and perfect. Well, first things first, the coffee, and you're going to love this because their coffee is delivered by bicycle by Courier Coffee Roasters located downtown Portland about six miles from Toast and needless to say the coffee is spectacular which is one of the first things that caught my attention like a slap in the face along with these mini scones they serve when you first sit down. Nice! Well, Donald Kotler opened Toast in August of 2007 which is a good sign, for this was one of the best years ever in my opinion for Napa Valley California Cabernets. I digress, let's talk about the food. The menu is very unique in a couple of ways, first the name for the Entrees are very cool and intriguing that will make you dig further into the contents of the dish. That's the good news.

First, the place was packed on a Wednesday night, which is a great sign! Second, the server remembered everyone's drinks (I know that should always be the case, but never ceases to impress me). Third, the food was decent. I mean if you're scheduled for heart surgery or have high levels of cholesterol, I'd recommend you stay away. But if you just ran a marathon, this is where you come to splurge. In the latter case, do try the chips with blue cheese and the fried green tomatoes for appetizers. I also got the fish n chips and although I've had better, I've had much worse more often. Hit the fish n chips spot. My friend ordered the rib-eye steak, which looked like it weighed 5 pounds. When I'm in the mood for steak I'll do that. Another friend ordered the shrimp and grits and that was the only thing on the table that looked terrible (but most restaurants- Empire State South notwithstanding- screw up grits).

It was taking a really long time after the rum cake was finished to get cookies, knowing we could've whipped up a batch at home in that much time.  Finally the server apologized and said they came out overdone the first time so they are remaking them.  They were very tasty, hot out of the oven, but frankly tasted like Nestle Tollhouse.

The tables are pretty tight and 4 of us barely fit. I was glad to see organic options on the menu. The food was ok, we had the Yukon breakfast and a burger. It was all good but nothing really to rave about. I found the decor to be kitschy for sure, I can't decide if I liked or disliked the rubber duckies piled in the pond at the entrance. The washroom is definitely in need of an upgrade. The service was unenthusiastic and they managed to confuse our simple order.

When my food arrived, on a little pig shaped wood board, I could feel my face break out into a smile. The brisket was delicious (and I had some in Texas, so pretty good comparison!). It was flavorful, easy to pull apart, meaty and juicy. The ribs came with a hot BBQ sauce that was sweet and spicy, and the meat was easy to get off the bone. They have other sauces available, but I chose the sweet BBQ and the hot BBQ to try out. The vegetables were amazing, and I actually finished those up first. Plantains were great as well, ripe and sweet. Pig Floyd's completely satisfied my BBQ craving!

The new space (note: they have moved a block away from their original location) is colorful enough, though the room lacks any real kind of ambience or coziness (think of it this way -- Casa Portugal has more ambience than Muqueca -- and I don't think Casa Portugal is notable for its ambience).  \\n\\nI ordered the muqueca, which was not nearly as rich as I thought it would be -- it's a thin, mild broth with tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and tons of shrimp served with a bowl of rice and a watery, but thankfully quite flavorful, seafood stock.  Admittedly, I was picturing a thick, rich stew of coconut milk and fish, so this was far lighter and milder (and, frankly, blander) than I expected.  I also ordered a side of fried plaintains, likely the best part of the meal --fried to (unhealthy) perfection, these were absolutely delicious.   Our friends also ordered muqueca (one had fish, one had fish and shrimp) and my husband had the sirloin, which was pretty tough (note: no steak knives at Muqueca, or at least none were presented after we requested one), served with a fried egg and onions.\\n\\nThe dessert choices might warrant a trip down Cambridge Street to Christina's -- we had the chocolate flan, which was more mousse than flan.  Dense and heavy, it wasn't exactly what I expected.  There are other options though, including a tiramisu (they were all out of tiramisu tonight) and a chocolate cupcake which looked promising.\\n\\nWhere Muqueca is less impressive is with its service.  The oddness started when we walked in and the waitress told us she wouldn't seat our incomplete party (we were waiting for our two friends).  Ordinarily I'm fine with this kind of policy, but the waitress was surprisingly rude, and it seems to me that any kind of policy should be communicated in a friendly-- rather than a punitive-- way.   Once we were seated, it took a long time to get our waitress' attention, but when she arrived she was very helpful with menu suggestions.  However -- and here I echo Kim P.'s review-- when my husband ordered the sirloin steak, he asked for salad instead of fries.  When the dish arrived with a heap of fries, he said \\"I actually asked for salad.\\" The waitress said \\"no you didn't,\\" and he said, \\"Well, yes, I did.\\"   She walked away and returned with a small salad and an unhappy face.  Finally, a small service no-no: Muqueca was guilty of my all time restaurant pet peeve! The waiter started clearing plates before we were all finished.  \\n\\nFolks absolutely love Muqueca (it was packed when we were there, and any time I've passed by, it's been crowded) and I suspect the crowds appreciate the casual atmosphere, the affordable prices, and the comfort food.  If you want something relatively simple -- like a fish stew -- Muqueca is a great, relatively cheap option.  I wouldn't, however, recommend it if you want a nice evening out- the service is a bit too prickly, and the food is a bit too bland."},{"name":"Zippity Do Dog","address":"160 Speen St","city":"Framingham","stars":"4","text":"I've only been twice, but boy is this place great.

Sometimes I'd head to the rocky beach at sunrise and wouldn't leave until sundown, exhausted and sunstroked, feeling a bit like a salted, dried cod.\\n\\nOne of the worst parts of spending my days frolicking on the salty shores of the Atlantic was, at the end of those days, coming home and peeling off my sand-encrusted suit, only to find several salt water minnows (\\"shiners\\", as we called them) dried and taut, affixed to my stomach and pubescent titties like anchovies on a pain bagnat.  I'd peel them off and, with a bit of sadness, flush them down the toilet before hopping in the shower. \\n\\nI don't eat dried fish.  \\n\\nI have made this abundantly clear to all who know me.\\n\\nStill, every time I go to Atasca with my father he tries to get me to split the Bacalhau a Lagareiro with him.  And I know why--because he wants half of my Camarao Atasca. He wants to have his reconstituted dehydrated fish and eat my delicious prawns, too.\\n\\nNo. Way.\\n\\nI love the Camarao Atasca--big juicy prawns grilled and served with a spicy tomato sauce--because they are so tasty and delicious, but also because they are served with the most wonderful broccoli rabe and sliced fried potatoes.  I have never ordered another entree at Atasca because this one is so phenomenal I just can't get enough of it.  It amazes me that my dad thinks I might consider trading half my succulent crustaceans for a lump of his rehydrated fish.\\n\\nI also adore the marinated octopus appetizer and the warm squid salad.  \\n\\nI will say that the food at this newer Atasca location is really not as good as it was at their old one.  While this one, with its outdoor dining under the grape arbor,  is very pretty and the food is still quite good, I really enjoyed visiting their little hole in the wall down the street, with its more rustic, homey feel.  Still, Atasca is always on my list of places to visit when I am in the Boston area, along with the beautiful salty shores of the Atlantic.\\n\\n*removes bikini and peels a salted dried lofasz from adult-sized bosom*"},{"name":"Night Owl Cafe","address":"8580 Cambie Road, Suite 104","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"After reading the reviews here I decided to come try it out for breakfast.

I am usually not a cauliflower fan but it was really good.  Then we had the seared scallops.  They were good.  A tad over priced for what you get at 2 for $20.

Lots of windows and light, but the windows provide some privacy by being screened up to a point where only curious heads can be seen above it.  Went with a growing crew of  four folks around 4:30  that eventually ended up being about ten altogether.  The staff was very accommodating in allowing us to gobble up other tables around us.  Very helpful in explaining the food items even if their rule of requiring pairs of items to be ordered is somewhat odd (understandable, though, since the small plates would be a pain in the ass to have to produce one at a time.)  Generally, the staff were really pleasant and helpful and on top of things.  The place has a relaxed spartan quality to it that I like.\\n\\nItems tried: \\nthe steamed pork bun (delicious and filling, just the right gummyness to the dough)\\nspicy chiang mai sausage (lime, lemongrass, cilantro, ginger, etc.-- lots of flavor)\\nquail egg skewer (wrapped in bacon w/ spicy mayo sauce-- wow.)\\nlamb skewer (lots of flavors on the meat with some nice garlic punch)\\nVietnamese short ribs (could have used more fish sauce, but I go overboard on the stuff)\\npork collar (marinated in ginger, honey, soy, pepper w/ dipping sauce-- juicy)\\nprawn skewer (grilled and with an excellent sweet chili sauce)\\nmiang kham (a plate with individual piles of peanuts, ginger, Thai chilies, fried dry shrimp; toasted coconut, lime, shallots with betel leaf wrappers and spicy palm sugar sauce)\\n\\nThese are all small (sometimes tiny) dishes meant to be ordered in groups which allows for a variety of tastes to be had.  (I've seen the discussions about whether or not this is a particularly authentic street-style or a bastardization of it, etc., but I'll leave it to the more well-Asia-traveled to talk about that.)  Some may be put off by the aggregated cost of ordering so many separate dishes, so if your looking to get stuffed for cheap-- keep walking.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the multitude of flavors available in all the plates mentioned above, but the chiasng mai sausage and the quail egg skewer were really excellent (the richness of the bacon/quail skewer remains fondly stuck in my mind weeks later--  simply delicious.) \\nIf you go, you really should try the miang kham-- the mix and match opportunity is fun and tasty.  You have the opportunity to personalize your own mix of multiple flavors by picking items and wrapping them in betel leafs.  Great conversation starter.\\n\\nDrink:\\nPing has mostly Asian beers ( the usual suspects of Kirin, Tsingtao, etc  along with other lesser  known regional beers from Asia-- a Japanese stout, 33, etc.) with a few other mainstreams (Heineken, etc.) and locals (Rogue, Full Sail) tossed in (as well as a few house wines).  I'm curious top check out the list of interesting non-booze drinks (like the Vietnamese artichoke tea--? And the drinking vinegars), but on this occasion I stuck with alcoholic options.  They have sake options, but we went with the shochu ( a sweet potato based alcohol that seems to be gaining traction in PDX these days).  Was skeptical, but turned into a believer after my first glass on ice.  Hint of sweet and tasty.  I'd recommend trying one.    The shochu cocktail (with  jinro shochu, sweet potato drinking vinegar and soda) is a fantastic summer drink-- very refreshing.  \\n\\nAs I mentioned, this is a great after work stop and works well as a hoping off/ winding it up at the end point to other places in the area, too.  A nice addition to a neighborhood I'm growing very fond of (Someday Lounge, Backspace, UpperPlayground, Ground Control, etc. are all within a block).\\n\\nBathrooms:  Didn't get the opportunity to check it out, but some at the table really liked the surreal poster work and said it was uber clean."},{"name":"SanSai Japanese Grill","address":"539 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I really enjoyed my Sushi at this sushi place, Especially the dynamite roll with wonderful sauce with variety of seafood, scallop, squid, mussels.\\n\\nI really liked the sushi here because the sushi rice is served hot, it's really one of a kind and special.

To decor is simple. No table cloth or fancy chairs here. Place looked clean. Was only about 30% full at the time. Service was prompt...in fact we were not yet ready to order. After deciding on what we would get, family style we put in our orders. That's when I started taking stars off.\\nMy first item was for Lollipop Chicken. 'Sorry, do not have it\\"\\nSecond item was for whole chicken . 'Sorry, it will take 1 hr to make\\"\\nHow about Chicken Bihari . 'Sorry, we make beef only\\"\\nAt this point I was ready to get up and call it a day by going to Torchys. However my wife calmed me down....besides I was sitting against wall in a booth so could not get up quickly.\\nWe settled for ordering Chicken Biryani, mild, saying that way Toddler could have it. Also ordered two different types of chicken both kebabs. And Chaplin kebab as well as a paneer curry dish.\\nHow was the food......very good grilled food and well spiced (Pakistani style not the wimpy Indian spice)\\nHad 3 Naans which were freshly made, hot, soft and delicious. \\nThe Biryani was drier than I prefer but it was spicy hot...the Toddler could not tolerate that, even with Yogurt added. We had to get chicken nuggets for her. The fries that came with that were excellent BTW, but that's not why we were there.\\nThe side accompaniment of lettuce/carrots was wilted. Leftovers from the afternoon buffet clearly.\\nThe Mango Lassi was good- difficult to screw that up.\\nIn summary the food was good. Recommend you focus on grilled foods and meat/chicken curries in a Pakistani restaurant. The vegetarian choices, while not bad are not where they shine.\\nThe food did take 20 mins to arrive....it was freshly prepared.\\n\\nSo recommendations to management:\\nLettuce and carrots cannot be wilted. Serving leftover from buffet is a big No No.\\nIf items not available tell your customers when you hand them menu, not after they have been salivating over the possibilities.\\nMild means just that. The wait staff have to be instructed to convey preference to kitchen. \\n\\nWill I be back? Don't know, too many good restaurants in Austin. But the fact the grilled foods were great may drag me back at least one more time.

The chicken here is pretty oily, but not as oily as what you might find at KFC. It has a satisfying crunch to the skin and you have the options of spicy and regular seasoning. Personally I can't handle 3 pieces of spicy so I usually ask for 1 or 2 regular seasonings with my order. The golden fries that accompanied my chicken was also quite crunchy and not too flaky on the inside. They take on an interesting curly shape which helps with scooping up more ketchup. It's a shame you can't skip the fries for another piece of chicken, but¬†overall I think this is a great meal for $5 after tax.

The corn on the cob made me feel like I was sitting at a summertime picnic.\\n\\nBy far, their tacos are absolutely my favorite! Best taco in Orlando by a landslide. In particular, the sausage taco is bite after bite of mesmerizing flavor. The pork belly taco is a close second. \\n\\nThe rustic modern atmosphere is warm and inviting. There is a bar with a variety of craft beers on tap. On a cool day, definitely recommend having a meal outside at their neatly lit porch. \\n\\nBiggest critique is concerning speed of service.

Zero complaints about the dinner food or drinks. Unfortunately, the service has been EXTREMELY POOR the last two times we've came here. I give their service 2.5 stars for the experience I received a few weeks ago on April 11th around 9 - 10 pm.\\n\\nRecently, we had a male server who started off courteous but quite literally dropped off for an entire 25 minutes and didn't bother to come back to our table. For 25 freaking minutes we went without a drink!!!! The sad part is he literally had only 3 tables (that included ours). Two people at each table. The place wasn't busy. There were empty tables everywhere.\\n\\nApparently, this server had better things to do though.  One of his tables happened to be two of his friends that he knew in real life (or at least it sounded that way). He completely lost all track of time and spent the entire time loudly blabbering away at their table. He even came over to the table behind us, checked up on them & briefly made eye contact when filling their wine (as if he was going to come over to tend to us.) Nope! He went directly back to that table to continue is loud, excessive conversation. \\n\\nAfter 25 minutes of no service and trying to get this guys attention by turning around and staring at him for minutes on end. We gave up and finally waved down the hostess and asked him to please get us a drink refill because our server hasn't served us in 25 minutes. The hostess was polite and gave us our drinks very quickly. Kudos to him! Should have tipped him instead. It was obvious the hostess guy went over to the male server at some point to tell him that we were pissed off. Coincidentally, the server FINALLY broke away from his friend's table to go back into the kitchen. He brought our food out immediately (which who knows how long it had been sitting there), and tried to \\"apologize\\" to us right after.\\n\\nInstead of just owning up to his mistake (you know, the fact that he neglected us for 25 minutes without a drink, didn't bother to check up on us, or bring our last dish out on time). This guy had the freaking audacity.... the nerve to lie. He blamed the other table saying something along the lines of \\"They wouldn't stop talking to me &  \\"I couldn't get away from them.\\" Guess he wasn't aware that we could hear him clear as day doing majority of the talking, asking questions, and egging on the conversation. He was the one being a motor mouth. I don't appreciate being lied to or BS excuses like this. He tried to mend the situation by bringing us free dessert. We tipped him ONLY because we received free dessert. He definitely didn't deserve one after lying through his teeth like that (we're great tippers & super chill people too). \\n\\nAt this point, I'd much prefer to get served by robots; servers like this really ruin a good night out. Plus, the business will lose money in the long run when their servers are giving out freebies to compensate for the fact that they're not doing their jobs.\\n\\nPlease install tablets, beepers, or service buttons at your table since your servers can't be trusted. Or maybe just invest in technology altogether to just do away with them completely and just have food runners instead? I don't mean to be rude. I don't want a free coupon or a manager to contact me about my experience. Food & drinks are a huge aspect of business, but so is the service. :/"},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Of all the things to do/see/eat/drink in Portland, Salt and Straw was number one.

They serve some standard flavors (~10) and a rotating selection of seasonals (~6). \\n\\nThe ice cream was delicious and incorporated other local chains (like Woodblock Chocolates and local salts), and I liked that it wasn't overly rich (you know, the type that melts immediately because of high fat content?). \\n\\nMy favorites: Sea salt caramel (zomg), and almond brittle (what they're known for). \\n\\nPretty Good: Vanilla (if you're a purist), fudge brownie (loved the big gooey chunks), and olive oil (but one bite was enough for me!).\\n\\nOK: Stumptown (a little disappointing, tasted pretty standard to me?)\\n\\nOverall, loved the ice cream but be prepared for a line!

It was my birthday so we decided to go play pool, sing some karaoke and possibly grab a bite. The only thing we did that night was eat and sing we did not get a chance to bowl or pool. My friend told the bar tender it was my birthday and offered us both a shot and we accepted. Turns out they give sugar and water as a shot to outsiders? ( we are both from New York).. I really did like this place until they came out of nowhere with this nonsense.. sugar and water? I dont know what this bartender's deal was that night but it was awfully rude and not funny at all. I love my alcohol please dont mess with that. Anyway, fast forward to last night. We had the chance to play pool and bowl for once! Everything here is paid for separately which can be annoying if you need to speak to different people for different bills. The food here- well it's a place for locals to have fun on a saturday night. Nothing crazy but not bad \\"bar food\\". Drinks are watered down and my friend asked for more liquor last night because the guy pulled out a 16 oz glass and poured in 1 shot of vodka.. ummm??? what? they deserves 2 shots lol.. they told us they arent allowed to give double shots.. ummmm????? If we're paying for it give us the double shot. Night was going good we were bowling after we were done with pool. Right by the bowling alley there is another bar.. i cannot stress this enough. When there are people surrounding your bar A.K.A us and the countless others you attend to everyone. It took us 15 mins to order a PITCHER OF BEER. The guy working last night was the worst at making eye contact. We couldnt get his attention or he didnt try to at least. Some woman came over and apologized for having us wait but there was nothing she could do. She said there was a wait to get a drink... ummm????? WHAT? what wait? lol it sounds stupud because it IS. We had to walk to the other side of the bar to get his attention. Finally, 20 mins after the fact we finally get our beers. Also we were skimped out on our lane for bowling after going outside for a quick smoke. Did not know you can give up someones lane if you're in the middle of a game? they had to move us to another lane and that lane happened to not work. instead of moving us to another lane they called over a mechanic. it got it fixed for us. didnt make eye contact with us. didnt apologize for the inconvenience just played with the machine and got rid of the bowling ball that got stuck on the sides. again it's too hard for them to give us a lane that actually worked. \\noverall. we had a great time. service COULD BE SO MUCH BETTER by the bowling area/bar.

On Valentine's day the bartenders were handing out roses toward the end of the evening.  Sometimes it's the little things that keep you coming back. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the food has been hit or miss. I was promised the best tiramisu I've ever had and sadly it turned out to be just about the worst. Tiramisu should not have sugary syrup poured over it.  I have a sweet tooth, but it was so sugary it made my teeth ache. I have however had some other really good dishes. The zucchini pasta was inventive, could use a little punch of spice or mushrooms or something to liven it up, but a fresh twist for someone trying to avoid carbs. Salads are great and some of the seafood dishes were winners.\\n\\nThe only other downside is one of the female bartenders. She always seems to have a hair across her ass.

Being impossible to shop for, i decided my Christmas gift this year would be dinner at Rino's!  We drove up from Connecticut on a Saturday night and were shocked to find no wait at 5pm (thank you Patriots play off game, apparently no wait at 5pm on a Saturday is a once in a lifetime opportunity at Rino's).\\n\\nI knew Rino's would be good, but i was skeptical that it would live up to the hype, and the four hours of total drive time we put in to get there.  Well, it did.  Our waitress was exceptional, a true Italian who felt more like a dinner host than a waitress; never rushing us, always taking time to check in, and very knowledgeable about all things Rino's.  We started with three appetizers; the calamari (excellent and very tender), the clams & mussels (very fresh with the star being the red sauce!), and the special layered eggplant with creamy pesto sauce (yes i will be combining cream with pesto next time i make it).  For entrees, we ordered the pistachio encrusted lamb, seafood pasta (my dad was able to self select the seafood he wanted included), open seafood ravioli, and lobster ravioli.  Another great thing about Rino's is the portion sizes are so large that really everyone can share without feeling like they just sacrificed a precious bite.  And, yes... every bite is pretty precious.  \\n\\nWe took home enough food to probably make 3-4 more servings and without any room to spare, i was the only one 'brave' enough to tackle dessert.  Well, not that brave i just got the pineapple sorbet which comes in an actual pineapple shell (despite being extremely full i rationalized this decision by telling myself that pineapple is a good digestive aid).  With a bottle of wine, a few sodas and coffee added to the above our bill totaled about $220 plus tip we were at $275 for four people - more expensive than i thought it would be, but we all ordered expensive dishes and a large quantity of appetizers.  My dad and i agreed it was better than any meal we ate on a trip to Italy a few years ago, so i do think the price tag for Rino's was worth it (much cheaper than a plane ticket to Europe).

As he took their drink order the waiter (who also seemed to be the bartender or at least spending a lot of time behind the bar) then approached us for the first time and asked what we would have. We told him we were just looking for food and he told us he was going to go make the other couple's drinks and then come back for our order. I'm not sure why he didn't take our order to put in; we sat waiting for him to come back while we watched him make their drinks. Finally we ordered and asked if there were any side options besides fries. I'm sure to always do this politely and with no expectations because I know serving can be really difficult when people have presumptuous requests, but he told us he didn't know and if we wanted anything in particular it would depend on how well it translated into Spanish (we assumed so he could communicate it to the kitchen staff). We were just genuinely curious about if there were other options. We ended up getting a great side salad, and honestly the food was good (we split a burger and an entree salad as well, nothing fancy) but the waiter really made the experience undesirable.

They don't need more people saying that the texture of the ice cream is consistently rich and creamy and perfect every time. But I will say it, along with all the others.\\n\\nI am so glad I am where Salt & Straw is. I can't tell you how many times I've been there, even if I haven't planned on going there. Nor can I tell you how many times I've raced the clock and tucked as many pints that would fit into my insulated bag and made the trek through traffic that was just descending into rush hour madness to get my precious cargo into the freezer at my home out in Forest Grove (and it can be done without melting into a puddle, in case you're wondering...). I also couldn't tell you how I manage to resist eating all the pints I bring home the second they get there like an insane person. Instead, I ration it out until I know I can head back into Portland and get more. \\n\\nMy sister said it best when she noted, \\"Salt & Straw ice cream has ruined all other ice creams.\\" The ice cream from this fantastic establishment is my gold standard now and if, for example, I can't bring it to a birthday gathering in Bend, we just don't eat ice cream. While Tillamook ice cream is alright in a pinch, I almost always hold out for the concoctions at Salt & Straw.\\n\\nThere is something for everyone here. If you like lavender or pears and blue cheese or just a knock-your-socks-off vanilla, these guys do it right. Oh, you want a dairy-free option? Well, they have it. Sorbets? Yep. Milkshakes? Sure. A flippin' flight of ice cream? Yeah, they have that too. Their classic menu is epic and their monthly rotation is like a dose of Christmas all year long. They support local artisans regularly and even have some of their product at their locations (might I suggest Pinkleton's Caramel Corn or Woodblock Chocolate?) If you want to emulate their kind and friendly staff you can even buy an awesome ice cream scoop inscribed with the Salt & Straw logo... it is kind of akin to getting your Junior Pilot wings.\\n\\nFor those of you who fear the queue and have let it deter you from stopping in, knock it off. Use the opportunity to meet someone new and chat about the flavors or where they're from (people come from all over to partake in these icy delights and they're generally in a good mood as they are about to eat delicious ice cream). Or, just know that if you are adventurous and can commit to a pint before tasting, you can move straight to the front of the line with one or many of the prepackaged flavors. Also, it really is just worth it. The staff is friendly and treat you like you're the only person there once it is your turn. They encourage tasting the myriad of flavors and are great with suggestions. Just make sure once you're at the front of the line at the Alberta location to keep moving forward if there is a gap.\\n\\nI know this review is superfluous because everyone already knows how great Salt & Straw is but I love this place and support it with all of my being. The folks here do what they love and that passion spreads to all who partake in it.\\n\\n***Note: this review was updated because Yelp said I needed to review Salt & Straw. I thought I had already done it but didn't check and ended up writing a review I liked more for a location I hadn't been to.

The black berry syrup was intoxicating. beautifully flavored toast with a fine crisp crunch layer that makes one bite not enough. \\n\\nFrittata: I loooooooved this frittata, one of the best i've had.

The cheese combination is out of this world. \\n\\nNorth African Sausage with eggs, couscous and cauliflower: wow...i mean wow...The spices, the unique flavor of this firm sausage, the light fluffy couscous, such a great mouthful after next. \\n\\nSteak and eggs with polenta: this is what i want for my death row meal. well the polenta and steak at least i was egged out at that point. The steak was perfectly seasoned medium rare, the polenta was fluffy and crispy and just yum, i want it now, right now, in my mouth please. It seems like such a pedestrian order right? steak and eggs? and yet it was so magically different. \\n\\nNeedless to say we had more than enough food, I love sharing so tapas is the perfect vehical for that. the service was prompt and friendly with many refils of coffee.

Haven't been there in a while mostly due to not liking the way the tables are on top of one another but I have always been mostly satisfied with their food and service.  So everything was fine including the food and service until it was time to pay the bill. The total came to $13.59 and all I had in my wallet were $20 bills. So I gave her a $20 and she said she would be back with the change and I was prepared to leave her a decent tip. So she came back and left me $6 without the 41 cents change. I figured it was a mistake but when I turned around to tell her she was already gone. It took me a while to have somebody find her but eventually she came over.  I told her she forgot to leave me the 41 cents expecting her to say sorry for the mistake.  Instead she said it was their policy to round off! I am thinking did she really just say that to me. So I said bring me the change right now so she stormed off and went to a couple of registers while looking back at me while speaking to her fellow coworkers.  She came back and slammed the change on the table and again stormed off before I could say a word. I am thinking this can't be policy as I never had this happen there or anywhere.  I did leave a small tip and then asked to speak to the manager at the front register.  I told her what happened and she was sincerely shocked by what I was telling her stating if anything the change differential would always be in the customer's favor. I described the waitress to her and she said she knew who she was and that she was new and maybe that was the way it worked in her previous place of employment! . She then asked me if there was anything she could do to make this right and I said she should talk to the waitress to get to the bottom of this because it was really bizarre.  I told her I will be putting this on YELP, I don't think she was pleased by this. One thing I have noticed is that unlike some other establishments that get bad reviews on YELP they don't respond to them.

Soggy cornbread with a little avocado spread, onions, and a tiny bit of shredded meat on each one. Oh, and it was topped with a dusting of cheese. Not good.

It also comes with French fries, coleslaw, and a pickle. My impression-- ~Meh~ The sandwich looked good, but the American cheese was kind of the opposite of gourmet. This same sandwich, with better cheese, could have really sung. Instead, I found myself picking out the avocado and eating it alone. Is it their fault if the menu clearly stated American cheese? I guess not, but I still think this could be a better conceived sandwich as the American cheese really overpowered anything else that was in that sandwich.\\n\\nThe other thing I noticed right when I sat down (and actually my whole table commented on it) was the uncomfortable booth chairs. Normally, I'm stoked to get a booth, but the padding on these seats were positioned oddly, so that they were wider at the top- pushing you forward- than the bottom. Usually, it would be the other way around (for lumbar support and such).

I don't know what all these other reviews are talking about because I've been out to eat for Italian food from the cape to Boston and this is by the the worst place I have ever been. Not only is it extremely small with hardly any parking, the place seems UNSANITARY and the food is cooked by all Mexicans who smoked cigarettes at the back door filling the place with smoke (as is it extremely small) and then come cook your food (who knows if they even washed their hands) because the bathroom is literally a 4x4 space that is located in their kitchen and is GROSS! I went to use the bathroom and there was brown spit in the sink that no one has rinsed and toilet paper clogging the seat with urine all around it! Ask to use the bathroom and you will have to go through the kitchen seeing a full view of who and how your food is being cooked and I'm sure you will not be happy! TRUST ME! Now let's move on to the food... I ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entrees (I was excited to try everything after seeing them on the diners, drives and dives show). The only thing I ate out of everything was their stuffed mushrooms (even though the caps were still pretty raw) and a few bites of the chicken from my husbands chicken parm! And even that was not great! Portion was huge but the pasta was way undercooked (which I don't understand since they charged us $5 extra to have the homemade pasta). I ordered the Bolognese which was a complete disappointment. The pasta was also pretty undercooked and the sauce was nothing special. I have had better at Mezza Luna in wareham, Gerardis on the cape, and even places like Di Parma and Four Seasons Italian cuisine are much better! The bruschetta was ok but had a strong pepper flavor and the salad with bread came with lettuce and 1 tomato with cold bread, no olive oil, just butter. They don't change their white table cloths after each party, leaving them stained And even there water tastes like it came from the Charles river... GROSS! I would never recommend this place and want to get in touch with this diner drives and dives show to let them know that things there must have changed dramatically!

My boyfriend and I went for the first (and last) time on a Saturday night.  We arrived around 8:00 only to be told that they were booked until 11:00 that evening.  The receptionist informed us that without a reservation, the best they could do was to put us on \\"the list\\" and hope that maybe something comes open within the next two hours!  Ok, usually I do my research when I go to a new place, and I did in fact go onto their website to check out the menu beforehand.  Nowhere did it mention that you needed reservations to get a table at a \\"bar\\".  We put our names on the list and waited patiently for a table or a couple of seats to open up at the bar.  When one bar seat became open, one of the female bartenders informed me that they would soon begin taking up bar stools and putting them away...WTH?  You've got a crowded bar/restaurant, no tables available, and you're taking chairs away???  After waiting for about an hour, we noticed that there were three empty tables that had been that way the entire hour we were there.  I asked about these and was told that they were reserved for large parties.  Seriously?  We could have eaten and been gone by the time the party arrived!  By this time I was really upset, and the ONLY reason we stayed was because I had won a gift certificate (Thanks Q100!) and I wanted to use it up.  Long story short, we ended up ordering our food to-go after an hour and a half wait  The staff there ranged from rude to totally indifferent.  There was one server (Davion, sp?), who was polite and took our to-go order.  When we got home and ate, we found that the food was bland and disappointing!  The grilled chicken club I ordered had no avocado as stated on the menu!  I love avocado, that was the main reason I ordered it!  My boyfriend's steak was tough and not well- seasoned.  The sauces that accompanied our desserts (the sticky toffee pudding and the chocolate cheesecake) were disgusting.  A bad night out ended up even worse once we got the food home.

Every last piece of kim chee and strand of jap chae. It was that good.  The bulgogi was soft and tender, not too chewy or fat ridden, marinated well.  The jap chae was actually one of the best I've had in that the noodles weren't over cooked, they still were chewy and had good flavor.  Rice was cooked just how I like it, slightly sticky. The only thing I would have improved was the salad dressing.  It was a thick sweet mayo consistency.  But even so, it balanced out the flavors and I ate it anyways.  Kim chee wasn't spicy but that also didn't make or break the meal.\\n\\nAll in all, the menu is pretty extensive and if the rest of the food is a reflection of what I had, I'm sure I'll be back time and time again.

We made reservations since we knew it was going to be crazy everywhere and 6:45pm was our dinner time. We got to the restaurant and we're told if we wanted to sit inside (it was a bit chilly outside) that we were going to have to wait 20-30min, so we opted to brave the weather outside. We were seated on the patio where there was appx 10 tables and only two were already taken so we got to pick what where we wanted to sit.  We were given water glasses and a self serve bottle of water by the support staff and few minutes later got some bread and olive oil. We sat and waited another 3-5min totally 7-10min now by the time our waiter graced us with his presence. While we're we're waiting we looked at the menu which appeared to be a special VDay menu which was a flat price for three courses. We didn't know how much it was until a neighboring table asked and was told it was $55/per person . We picked this place because it seemed a little more low key than many of the other spots and my wife was looking forward to numerous things on their regular menu. We chalked it up to the fact that we had not done our homework and even though it was more than we wanted to spend we gave it a chance understanding that it's a common practice to narrow down the menu to meet demand. The asked us if we wanted wine and we decided to hold off. We were explained how the menu was working for that evening and ordered our three courses. My wife got soup, a buckwheat pasta with radicchio and mushrooms in a \\"house sauce\\", and the tiramisu. I got the tuna fritter, house specialty ravioli, and chocolate cake. During the entire meal, all three courses were brought out by someone other than our waiter, which I get since it's a busy night, no problem there, but if the waiter doesn't bring the food out they need to check on tables shortly after they get their food to make sure they have everything they want to enjoy the meal (we get to that later). It took appx 15min to get our soup and fritter. My wife's soup came in about an 8oz cup and was only filled half way (she said she only got about 5 spoonfuls). On top of the fact the soup was small, after waiting 15min it was like warm at best. We were going to tell our waiter as well as ask for crushed red pepper/Parmesan but by the time we saw him again the smaller portioned food was getting cold so we opted to eat them. My tuna fritter was reasonably sized and was overall a tasty dish (no complaints there). After our appetizer we waited appx another 30min until we got our entrees. Mine was an average potion (6 ravioli or so) and my wife's was a fair sized portion of noodles. Mine was quite tasty and it had really good flavors, although I would have liked it spiced up with crushed red pepper and a touch of Parmesan, but again I had already finished my dish (as it was getting cold) appx 10min prior to the waiter checking on us. When the waiter did come I asked him for Parmesan and crushed red pepper so my wife could finish her dish which, overall, she wasn't crazy about because the radicchio was quite bitter and the sauce was a bit bland. He did promptly bring out as were quested and my wife finished her dish. We waited approximately another 10 to 15 minutes upon which time we received our desserts from another member of the support staff. Both of our desserts were tasty and we had no complaints there. We received the bill which with tax totaled about $120. I did not have a problem with the $55 price point but did not feel that the product that we received was worth anywhere close to that. I think on the high end I $35-$40 price point would have been more appropriate considering the amount and level of food we received, understanding that the services had nothing to do with the pricing of the food. After all was said and done we left the restaurant just before 8:30 PM totaling just under two hours for a narrowed down menu, which seemed excessive, not because we were in a rush, but because we waited so long between being seated and separate courses.  It seems like this place does things really good on a regular basis but was simply out of its element on Valentine's Day and was not properly prepared. We were at least one of three tables that our waiter had on the patio two of which had not even received their entr√©e by the time we left but we're seated prior to us being seated. So I guess from the outside looking in we were \\"the lucky ones\\". If we were not from out of town we would likely give it another shot for lunch or something else low-key to give it a fair shake, but overall last nights experience was terrible and at a pretty high premium.

My Pear & Bleu Cheese cone was like nothing I'd ever tried, creamy with just a hint of tang, and delicious.

The six-pack of beer flavors had just been retired in order to usher in berry season on our latest visit. I chose a Goat Cheese Marionberry Habanero and my fiance went for a Chocolate Blueberry Rice Krispy Treats. Both were superb. The nice thing about S&S is, despite the often wacky flavors, they are all subtle; nothing is ever overwhelming, but instead, each flavor complements the other. The goat cheese was mellow, the perfect vehicle for fresh Oregon marionberries, and there was just the slightest wisp of an aftertaste of habanero. The chocolate was rich, with fresh whole blueberries mixed in, and the Rice Krispy Treats added a nice little textural crunch. The ice cream is high in butterfat (17%), which makes it dense and creamy, and it isn't as sweet as you may be used to. That turns out to be a good thing: it allows all the flavors to shine, without being cloying. \\n\\nSalt & Straw is perfectly Portland. Hip and trendy, with organic, locally-sourced ingredients.

The strawberry had a lot of sugary sweet jam and I didn't really taste any black pepper. After awhile, it was just too much. The salted caramel was the one I liked the most.

I'm still thinking about my meal here and it was on Saturday! For context, this was my first dining out/drinking experience after giving up alcohol for Lent. So I don't remember my interaction with the barstaff or our server. But I remember the food like a fond childhood memory.\\n\\nFor starters, HK looks like a brighter, lighter, more airy Redbones: comfortably full of people totally getting down with their food. We had a wait before getting seated, so we sat in the open windows near the bar. I had a house white wine, which was tart for my taste, but for $6.50/glass, I'm not complaining. The bartender gave us a menu to look over while we waited, and for about 30 minutes, we salivated over the menu.\\n\\nBy the time we sat down at a table, it was already decided that we were getting the shrimp and grits. Hot damn! This was the BEST shrimp and grits I have had to date. The grits were lump-free which already gets this place 3 stars (see my review of Sorrelina). i think they had a little bacon fat mixed in, too, which always takes any dish to the next level of guilt and deliciousness. The shrimp were large and in charge. We split this among 4 people and each had about 1.5 shrimp. Great deal! Next time I'm gonna be greedy and just get this for my meal. \\n\\nBut I was 4 drinks deep at this point and I needed a damn sandwich (I'm demanding and particular when I'm tipsy). I went for the Cuban Reuben which was the best decision I made that whole day. Hot damn, that was a tasty sandwich. One sec....Yeeeeah, it was good. I just had to close my eyes and think about it again. Roasted pork, corned beef, spicy russian, swiss cheese & pickled cabbage on french bread grilled to perfection. The bread was just crispy enough to hold the ooey-gooey goodness in the sandwich, but not so hard that it tears up the roof of your mouth when you eat it. You know what I'm talking about, right? Kinda like how Capn' Crunch tears your mouth up when you eat it. This sandwich didn't do that at all. Breaking away from my healthy regiment, I got the fries on the side (salad is the other option) and I don't regret it all. I think they were handcut right there in the place because they tasted so fresh and potato-y (yeah, that's all I got! It was good, ok?!) \\n\\nThey do have a gluten-free menu!! Brendan got the Braised Pork Shoulder entree. I had a little taste of the pork and it was so tender. \\nJust so, so tender. The movements my mouth made as I moaned with delight was enough to break the pork down for swallowing (did I just say that?)\\n\\nMatt got the bolognese and I noticed he was noticeably quiet since the rest of us were audibly moaning as we ate. So I took some pity on him and gave him some sandwich. Which brings me to this conclusion...\\n\\nHighland Kitchen does pork right. Go.

I went with the biggest, The Westerner, which actually lets you get two different meats, but I went with double brisket. I went with the mac-n-cheese as well. This place is kind of set up like a City BBQ as far as condiments go, and they have three different BBQ sauces off to the side that you can fill up and take home. I snagged all of them.\\n\\nHonestly, this wasn't the best brisket I've had, and I don't really know what it was about it that I didn't like. It just didn't have a whole lot of flavor to me, and I'm not sure how I felt about the bun. The raw white onion that comes on it really didn't help, and I think it hindered the taste if anything. The BBQ sauces were pretty good, and I really loved the spicy one. Also, the mac-n-cheese was delicious, so that was a plus, especially since I never get mac-n-cheese with anything.\\n\\nHowever, I will be back to try this again, because A) it's really close to where I play hockey, and B) I'll give most restaurants a second chance.

But the live jazz band and great quality food make this place worth a visit."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Clean, friendly, and good food what more could you ask for...\\n\\nCame here because they had a great rating from yelp and I was certainly not disappointed.

This visit was sooo overdue. My friend from San Marcos wanted to meet up for lunch so I choose this place since downtown is a half way point for us. We went on a Monday at noon. The space is so cool. My friend just moved back to Texas from Chicago. We both agreed that there was some parts of the space that reminded us of some Chicago places. \\n\\nOur server was super sweet and friendly. When she figured out it was our first time there she took the time to explain things on the menu. She informed us that all the breads are backed in house, the meats are cured there and all the sausages are in house made also. It took us a moment to figure out what we wanted but we decided to get 2 easy boards and share. We got the German Easy Board - Pretzel, Bratwurst, Kraut, Beer Cheese,Potato Salad & House Mustard and the Mixed Grill Easy Board - Beef Sirloin & Cilantro Chimichurri, Pork Tenderloin & Stout Maple Glaze, Kielbasa, Grilled Okra, Sauerkraut & House Mustard. \\n\\nBetween the 2 boards we really like the Mixed Grill the best. However we loved the hot Pretzel and the Beer cheese on the German Board. I'm a fan of potato salad especially when it's not a mustard base. This seemed to be a creamy version (not sure if it's mayo or something else) with dill. Potato gets 2 thumbs up. The Bratwurst was good on the German but the Kielbasa on the Mixed Grill was the better of the two. It had a great smokey flavor. The Beef Sirlion with the Cilantro Chimichurri was to die for! The Beef was cooked perfectly, juicy and so flavorful. The Cilantro Chimichurri was a nice compliment. For those of you that don't like cilantro it was very mild. I know I'm going out on a limb saying this but even if you don't like cilantro I think you might be able to handle this. The Pork Tenderloin had a great crust to it and then the meat was moist and cooked just right. There were fresh cherries that were a garnish to the pork. It seemed that they were cooked or marinated with something but it was a great pair with the pork. I don't mind okra but it's not a go to vegetable for me. There's something about the texture and that gooey-ness that always bothers me. The okra was grilled along with grilled lemon to dress them with. I had a few pieces and I'll have to tell you it wasn't bad. I actually enjoyed it. Over all both boards were great! This made it fun for sharing. As my friend said it was like eating Tapas which we are both a fan of. \\n\\nTo finish off our lunch we ordered Chai Latte and Latte with the Danish Krans. I was debating on getting the Almond Croissant because I'm obsessed with them. We asked our server what her recommendation was and she loves the Danish Krans. She said it's a light version of the Almond Croissant. I can't remember exactly how she described it but she was so passionate and excited about it we had to try it. There were almonds in it with I think she said it was almond paste or marzipan in it. Either way it was flaky and delicious. \\n\\nI know have a reason to go back because I gotta try the Almond Croissant.

There are no servers to refill your drinks and the soda machine is not made accessible to go refill your own drinks. Thus, leaving you to get the attention of one of the employees for a refill.

The reviews are true.  It's that good.  It's just down the street from my house, but tends to get really busy for dinner.  As my prerogative is to get thoroughly hangry before considering eating, I am not usually one to wait.  What I find to be perfectly fitting is to hit Tasty 'n' Sons between 3p and 5p.  As a vegetarian, the sauteed spinach with sunny egg, radicchio salad and potatoes bravas makes for an abundant meal for a pittance.  In the summer, they raise the garage wall and it is perfectly lovely to street gaze.  Why not 5 stars?  1) Because the owner is an operational genius, fitting more people in the bar area than you may be down with, even if you are accustomed to the Portland communal tables 2) No take out.  3) There seems to be a little bit of tension among the staff 4) The \\"family style\\" dining concept (again operationally genius) is a bit lacking if you are dining with people of various food restrictions.  If you are not from the area and are unfamiliar with the \\"family style\\" concept, this means that you put in an order for food and it comes to you, at random, as the kitchen prepares it.  Tasty 'n' Sons seems to have even longer lag times between plate-delivery than others in town who use the \\"family style\\" dining concept.

They were extremely sour. I was trying to figure out what happened, was it too much lemon in the hollandaise sauce? Oh wait, that's vinegar. So maybe they used pure vinegar to poach the eggs in? Or both? It was almost unedible. I ended up picking the corned beef hash from it since my husband has started eating my pancakes.  He was hungrier than I was.

Each time a slightly different experience.\\nMy first time was after a long day of helping a friend move. This restaurant, sharing space with a live work building is perfect to come downstairs and enjoy a hearty, comforting dinner. \\nAnother time was for a private party. We were seated upstairs and had plate after plate of freshly prepared dishes coming our way. One memorable dish was the olive oil poached chicken breast with green sauce. It was so moist you'd forget it was the breast. \\nAnd tonight, we finally booked a spot for their weekly Wednesday family style supper. A three course dinner that starts at 7pm and everyone eats the same dishes. This month was as follows. Roasted eggplant with couscous and cilantro. One portion was half of a very large eggplant! Juicy and meaty, it paired well with the rosemary flatbread. I think my niece ate the most of the flatbread.\\nThe main course was leg of lamb. This lamb was so melt in your mouth tender, I look at lamb in a different light now. The length and effort of preparing this dish shines when you take the first bite. Cooked for 24 hours in 57degrees, that's taking slow cooked to the next level. The chickpea stew and the mint + cucumber yogurt were great accompaniments. The beet, red cabbage, and apple slaw was a great palate cleanser.\\nWe finished dinner with a rose water, orange blossom and pistachio rice pudding. The sweetness of the rose water and the salty crunch of the pistachio was nicely balanced. \\nThe generous portions and great price for this dinner will have me coming back. \\n\\nKessel&March, owned and family run, is a comfortable place where you feel welcome and can relax to enjoy a delicious meal. Chat with the lovely couple and you will realize right away how genuine and down to earth they are.\\n\\nKeep your eyes peeled. Apparently they will be doing pairings with breweries and the sort.

We went in around 3:30 and it wasn't busy at all. The dining area was very nice, and they had an excellent selection of appetizers and beers on tap. My friend tried a couple of their beers, and they looked good. We each got a bowl of chowder as we didn't have time for a full meal. The service was slow. Very slow. Several of the servers had dinner and were eating at a nearby table (including our server). We saw our chowders waiting for several minutes before the chef had to whistle for her to come over and pick them up! Not a good impression and not very good service. She checked in with us once and got another beer for my friend. The chowder was very good and a large portion. I thought it was slightly overpriced though. We ended up paying in cash and needed change which took quite a bit of time with two people having to do it as if they didn't understand how to properly work the register.

Almost everything was good; nothing was great.  Perhaps the best course was the charcuterie, which I've heard people rave about; although, even that was just good.  The foie bon bon was fun, but more because of its playful nature than anything.  The rest was pretty unmemorable until dessert, which was bad.  It was a chocolate stout cake that seemed very dry and uninteresting.  It seemed as though it had been cut, plated, and refrigerated many hours before service, leading to a dry crumb.  We both did the wine pairings.  All the wines were very tasty/interesting on their own, but none of them seemed to do much for enhancing the foods they were paired with.  All of the pairings worked, they just were uninteresting.  To be fair, pairing wines with a menu that changes as frequently as this one is a very challenging job, and it is sometimes better to air on the side of safe and uninteresting rather than bold and possibly offensive. However, I would have like to have had one pairing that sang.  \\n\\nAll told, dinner was good, but not worth the price tag.

Reviewing from a note I wrote in my phone on Wed, Oct 7, 2015 (around 8 PM). McDonald's just launched a breakfast-all-day event, and Wednesday offered a free Egg McMuffin between 5 AM and midnight. My source were at least two websites describing this (regarding Colorado stores, at the very least). The catch is you wear what you sleep in to the store. So, I donned a white tank top and soft black/white zebra pants, got in my car, and made a trip to the drive-through.\\n\\nI asked for an Egg McMufin. What resulted was a really dumb and degrading experience. The first employee at the window was a young teenager; I showed my phone and he walked off, only to return with a woman a bit older, about one minute later. I offered my phone screen and tried to hold it, but the woman insisted to hold it over the ledge (hanging about 2 meters to the asphalted ground). After over one minute, she said certain stores aren't honoring the deal. I provided another website, immediately, and asked her, \\"are you sure?\\" So, she said she would call the store manager (...wasn't she the manager? Aren't I in the drive-through lane? Doesn't the damn sandwich cost a measly $3... probably a quarter to make?!).\\n\\nNext window; woman there didn't know what was going on. I finally explained that some lady had sent me there and was supposed to call somebody about making my sandwich free. The woman at the window sought the woman on the phone, who showed up and says, \\"LET ME SEE YOUR PAJAMAS!\\" Oh my. So, I lean forward in my sedan and expose my white tank top. She asks, incredulously, \\"A white shirt? THAT's what you wear?!\\" Ummm, yes.. is. I respond with, \\"I could sleep naked and would arrive without clothes, but that'd be in appropriate.\\" So, she tells me to show her my PANTS. Oh, jeez. So, I try. She rolls her eyes and says she'll give me the sandwich \\"this time\\". As if she hasn't tried to degrade me and as if it wasn't a deal McDonald's has advertised. Jeez, thanks. I do thank her and ask for her name and the store manager. She says she called the sub for the manager, since she's on vacation. First, she says I should return in the morning, but eventually gives me the name of the store manager and the sub... with spelling difficulty.\\n\\nI smiled and thanked her for the sandwich, and left. The sandwich was cold and dry. It barely went down my throat. McDonald's, if you're going to offer breakfast all day, please don't make it stale and dry. I could just make my own breakfast in the morning and then let it dry out throughout the day. So, thanks but no thanks. Customer service FAIL. Food FAIL. New promotion FAIL.

The biggest problem with the ambience was the flashing ambulance lights from outside that were reflecting all around the room. I realize that isn't their fault but the hostess said it happens often from an assisted living facility next door so they might want to find a solution- it is seriously seizure inducing light reflection. \\nI found the service to be a little stuffy and that isn't really what I'm looking for in a happy hour. The general manager was giving an interview in the little lounge area next to the bar and it was amusing/awkward to listen to. When we left she was having a conversation with the hostess about why she kept her late and neither of them acknowledged us as we left. \\nWe ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad Skewers and the Buffalo Wing Dip. The caesar dressing only tasted like anchovies, I normally like anchovy flavor in my caesar dressing but it was overkill. The buffalo wing dip had very little buffalo flavor and mostly tasted like blue cheese. Overall the food was just okay, nothing special and there is MUCH better food in Portland. There was only 1 happy hour drink special and it was a raspberry mojito, not something we were interested in. Kind of a bummer to go to a place with a really interesting cocktail menu but none of those cocktails were on the happy hour menu. Limited and pretty boring beer selection too. Portland is an awesome city for happy hour and The Picnic House just doesn't measure up. Our happy hour experience has crossed The Picnic House off our list for future dining experiences."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"12553 State Rd, Ste 535","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This review is coming to you not as a foodie but as a mommy...

I had read on their Facebook page some bad reviews related to service and they were spot on. I visited recently and the service was horrible. Extremely slow and it wasn't even slightly busy in there. Plus, woman at cash register was chewing on food and talking with food in her mouth. I got soup and they didn't even give me any crackers. Soup was served so incredibly hot it took forever to cool. Soup was very mediocre tasting. I'm sorry to write this because I'm a small business owner myself and I support entrepreneurship and love to see non-chain businesses thrive. Hoping reading this will encourage Casual Cup the chance to get their act together before it's too late. Don't be so nonchalant about service. Don't treat customers like friends and family. They aren't. You can't be so casual. P.S. They don't have a menu board inside where you would expect one to be hanging -- where they take your order -- and no printed menus or anything near the counter. I didn't know what food they had to offer. Only knew because of sign outside that said they had soup. Not sure if I will ever go back.

Cask and Larder dares to identify with simplistic regional cuisine. It is billed as a Southern Public House from acclaimed Ravenous Pig owners and chefs. In a town where it is hard pressed to find good ole Americana, it is refreshing to taste the good ole south.\\n   \\nThe building exterior did not change. Apart from added outside benches and tables along Fairbanks Av. most remained the same. A limited menu of few items is served outside. However, the razzle dazzle happened all inside. You may expect the door closest to the parking lot is the main entrance but not so. You have to enter through the door on Fairbanks Av. Gracious entry with warm colors, dark toned wood, huge glass enclosures, muted floors, dated floor tile design and open beams immediately spreads southern hospitality. The light sea blue and white wall colors almost invokes southern plantation grandeur. Towards the end of the bar area are huge glass enclosed beer brewing equipment. A table in this enclosure suggest private dining or chef's table. I can only image the experience of dining in there surrounded by all of that beer. Wonder if guest are allowed to sample from each batch? Hmmm.\\n\\nThe food is sourced from seasonally fresh ingredients, so it changes all the time. Interesting jams, pickles, meats, seafood, and food preparations entice the palate. Having an in house beer brewery makes for some very startling choices, citrus zest and fresh lemon? Not many places have a cocktail menu much less a whiskey list. There are great selections of Bourbon and Rye neat 3 oz pours ranging from teens to twenties. Dessert boast Southern staples such as apple pie and turtle cake. The wine list is very food forward from family owned smaller wineries and lesser know regions. With almost all of the wines by glass I am a little surprised that there is a \\"House Wine\\". There is a late night menu that carries bar type food. Then there is that whole cookery menu. This is centered around a butchered cut with sides served family style. Reservations are required for Whole Cookery 72 hrs in advance with a minimum of 8 guests.\\n\\nBeer Flight- 5 Brewer's choice | 4oz. pours. From farthest to closest:\\n\\n1. LONE PALM GOLDEN ALE crisp & refreshing blonde ale ABV: 4.9% IBU: 18 - very clean\\n\\n2. OLDE SOUTHERN WIT Belgian-style wheat beer brewed with coriander, citrus zest & fresh lemon ABV:  4.8% IBU:  13 - exciting, refreshing, citrusy, clean, smooth\\n\\n3. BERLINER ROGGEN Sour Berliner-style rye beer Served with (or without) Raspberry syrup\\nABV:  3.2% IBU:  5 - I did not have a Raspberry syrup.

One of the most stand out dishes. Amazing balance of flavors and textures. Cooked to proper slight crustiness. A marvel.\\n\\nFried Dough \\"wit\\" beer doughnuts, soft caramel pudding, citrus-caramel glaze. Dough was lightly chewy and sugary.

From the greeters, to server assistants, to servers, to managers, to just any staff, the level of acknowledgement and cordiality showcases high commitment to deliver genuine hospitality. The blurred line in sequence of service is impeccable. My table was a little too small for the amount of food ordered.\\n\\nWhen a restaurant dares to push the envelope of doing something that the market has not seen it is always challenging. However, when a restaurant takes a calculated risk and it pays off there is success. I think Cask and Larder has hit that note.

So I asked the waitress and she say the lunch sandwitches have 2 eggs and breakfast have 1 egg then walked away... I got up, got a menu again then called her back and showed her what her own menu says. People, eggs implies more than 1.. she says \\"yea I can see what you mean\\" when I read the description I already know back. She asks if I would like another egg, so I say yes sure. She goes into the kitchen and returns in a minute to tell me \\"I will have to charge you for the extra egg\\" no thanks. I just want what I ordered. The sandwitch costs $4.50 which is expensive for a breakfast sandwitch. Christophers is full of itself and the place looks a lot nicer than it really is. Portions are small and coffee is really badly bland. Prices are high and they lie about the menu. Any good breakfast is going to put 2 eggs on a sandwitch anyway (regardless if its lunch or breakfast) especially if its $4.50. The waitress wasn't very smart either. Its an egg! Even if the chef says \\"no im charging for this egg on xmas eve. I DON'T CARE WHAT MY MENU SAYS.\\" She could have said \\"okay\\" to the chef.

A small gripe, this Tasty toast is the real deal.\\n\\nKyle's housemade granola with blueberries and lebneh ($5) - wish I'd tried the lebneh, but the milk had already been poured on - the one bite of granola I had tasted nice, though, and the lebneh was raved about by everyone else. Gotta report them facts.\\n\\nMoroccan chicken hash with harissa cream and over easy egg ($12): I love making Moroccan-style dishes, so it was no surprised my good friend, and frequent collaborator on such dishes contributed this winner. Great balance of flavor, and the lemon undertones cut down the richness just right. Another dish of which I could eat a full plate.\\n\\nCast iron frittata ($9) - I don't even really like eggs when the white/yolk are combined, and I at a nice big piece of this frittata.

I ordered 1/4 of a roast duck and some porridge combo (which came with soy sauce chow mein) and I also ordered a iced milk tea.  After a 15 minute walk back to the hotel, it didn't take long for my husband to get up since I told him I had roast duck.haha\\n\\nThe duck was good, maybe it was too early in the morning, but the skin wasn't crispy enough.  The taste was delicious.  To me, the duck itself tasted gamier.  Kinda different from the roast ducks we have in SF.  The porridge was ok and the chow mein could be better.

Such restaurants sometimes run the risk of spreading themselves too thin, but happily, this one delivered on every single dish that we ordered.\\n\\nBreakfast board: my favorite item!  I loved this because there were so many things on one plate, it's easy to share, and it was the quickest to arrive at our table, which makes sense given that it requires the least prep/cook time. However, time can make a big difference when you've been waiting in line for 30-40 minutes and are already quite hungry.  There was both soft pieces and small crunchy slices bread to pair with the sausage, the sour cream spread, the beets, the eggs, and several other toppings...and all of it was delicious. \\n\\nAuntie Paula's French Toast: flavorful, and with a good balance of sweetness.  The berries were juicy, the bread had just the right amount of softness, and overall it was a delightful dish.\\n\\nPork cutlets: crispy and with just the right amount of tanginess. The meat was cooked well so well that the pork seemed like it came fresh from the fryer, which tasted wonderful with the bed of spinach.  Only negative note would be that the crust was not well bonded with meat.  Other than that, delicious.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there was some miscommunication and the server did not deliver my friend's Moroccan Chicken Hash til after the other dishes had been eaten for quite some time.

The second time we went, it took 30 minutes for our desserts to get to us. When we asked what was taking so long for slices of pie to be delivered, they said it was because they were making more whipped cream (whipped cream takes literally 2 minutes to make regardless of the batch size, they were covering that the waitress forgot to put the order in). The third time we went, the wait staff seemed far more interested in congregating around the bar and hostess stand than checking on us while I was literally raising my hand trying to get some table salt (the chicken and waffles are good but are always under-seasoned). My brother literally had to carry our check and cards up to the bar after waiting 15 minutes for our waiter to come back to our table (he was busy talking with the other wait staff members at the bar).

We both had the rabbit fettuccine and goat stew. The food was extra spicy just as we requested and the service was great. The 3rd time, however, the food was not so good. We went for brunch. I'm convinced this is not their strongest point. The food was lukewarm, eggs overcooked, and everything tasted bland. Perhaps waiting outside for 30mins contributed to our overall dissatisfaction.  The other negative is the bar area. It does get a bit loud and chaotic at times. This makes it hard to enjoy a meal or a date in a relaxed atmosphere.

Do you know how impossible that is to find?  \\n\\nI had the Organic Kale salad with organic tofu (also very hard to find) and bean and barley soup.  Accompanied by Pinot Grigio.  Everything was lovely.  I love the purple cabbage in the Kale salad and it was not \\"over-dressed\\" at all.  \\n\\nOne thing I like about Flower Child is although they are vegetarian they offer non-vegetarian protein options.   I think at some point this was a business decision more than anything, \\"profit or no profit?\\"\\n\\nHow come more places aren't jumping on the no-sugar, no-sodium soda water train?  They have San Pelligrino, but only the ones loaded with sugar.  Also, no Topo Chico.  \\n\\nI also am still perplexed by the serve-yourself aspect.  Which basically means fetching your silverware and your sauces and your napkins and all the other accouterment.   Why is it an issue to not serve you fresh silverware with your meal?  Instead your silverware is siting in a dusty cup on a dusty patio, where surely several others have touched while fetching their forks and knives.   This just isn't hygienic, ya'll.  I know we sacrifice some sanitation when we eat out in a restaurant to begin with, but it seems contradictory that Flower Child, which I believe touts themselves as you know, HEALTHY, should prescribe to the fetch yourself approach.  I also struggle with this same aspect at Whole Foods and everywhere else I overpay for food.   \\n\\nAll in all a pleasant experience."},{"name":"Tinos Greek Cafe","address":"1201 Barbara Jordon","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Food is just OK. When i went inside the first thing i saw was the so-called beef/lamb in the vertical rotisserie. The so-called beef/lamb meat is the frozen chunk of hot dog meat (with spices) that you get from Sysco/Ben E. Kieth/US Foods. A Greek fast food \\"restaurant\\" with fake meat!! The beef/lamb is authentic of Greece and this place has the fake kind (which you find everywhere else because is as cheap as it can be and its dirt meat).\\n\\nThe service staff is overall helpful, besides some of them that are not customer service oriented what-so-ever. The manager that was on duty when i visited, Jesus, is a complete incompetent when it comes to dealing with customers. Rude, does not make any sense on what he says, and absolutely greedy. He was looking at me right in the eyes after I let him know my concern, like he was about to jump out of the counter and start a fight.\\n\\nThe owner (which i contacted before reviewing his restaurant on yelp, so i could give him a chance to explain), did not even bother to answer my e-mail sent more than a week ago. I took the time to let him know what goes on in his restaurant and i have not gotten any answer back. This is unacceptable, when the owner puts his personal e-mail to be contacted and does not respond back.\\n\\nA very bad experience. Bad manager at the time of my visit.

Instead of feeling cramped, slightly dirty, and rushed, Flats' new digs make the most of the small space and made it clean, inviting, and modern. I loved the detail of the cedar panels on the wall, the giant map mural along the main wall, the lights, and the comfy booths. The menu is clearly displayed behind the registers and has a decent variety of flatbread/panini offerings for breakfast, lunch, and dinner as well as fresh juices. You can also build your own flatbread which is pretty cool.\\n\\nThey offer a great combo of  1/2 flatbread/panini, 1 side, and medium drink for only $9. I tried the combo with a Casablanca flatbread (chicken, bacon, arugula) and a side of the caprese salad. While the flatbread was very good, the caprese salad was disappointing. It was a simple mixture of diced mozzarella and tomatoes with the balsamic reduction drizzled on top. But where was the basil?? You can't have a caprese salad without any basil! Very sad.\\n\\nMy coworker got the bbq chicken flatbread and was very happy with her flatbread. Another coworker also got the bbq flatbread but swapped out the chicken for tofu. FYI the tofu is not seasoned or marinated so it might be too bland for some people. If you dine in, flatbreads come out on long wooden paddles which makes for great presentation, but take up a lot of space on the table.\\n\\nOverall it is a nice spot for a casual lunch in the downtown area. It's been less than 2 weeks since they opened so they're still working out some kinks, but overall, food was good and service was friendly.

Upon entering the restaurant it was very busy the Decor was beautiful. We got seated quickly and a nice gentleman brought us ice water with fresh lemon in it. It seemed a bit chaotic with a lot of servers walking around some appearing to be working others appearing just to kind of be walking from one side of the restaurant to the other side of the restaurant. It was a Friday night and the place was busy. We were finally greeted by a server after about 15 to 18 minutes. He did not tell us about the grand opening specials. We placed an order for three orders of salad rolls and a pho soup. It took about 17 to 20 minutes for us to get our food and it was delivered by a different waiter. The price of the food was on the higher end for the soup and the salad rolls but both were good and taste and quantity. Nobody ever came back to our table and asked us how we were doing or if there was anything else we needed or wanted. We had to ask for silverware and napkins. We needed more water and my daughter took it upon herself to go find the water picture and bring it to the table and fill it herself because again nobody ever came back to the table. Upon completion of eating we waited about another 15 to 18 minutes for somebody to come by so that I could ask for the bill. I made eye contact with our original waiter who took our order and he went and got the bill and apologized for the wait. I love the convenience of this restaurant but if this place is going to make it they really need to cater more to their customers and impress with great customer service. I hope that they use these reviews as constructive criticism because it appears that everybody nearly as saying the same thing and when you go out to eat and you're paying top dollar for food and there's no customer service as a customer you think to yourself prior to going to that restaurant oh I like the place but it's going to be a pain to get seated and to get waited on and to get our food and to get our bill and that discourages customers from wanting to go to your restaurant. I sincerely hope it improves because I love salad rolls and I love pho soup and can see this being one of my go to regular restaurants if the service can get up to standard."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love it there, especially the seats looking out the front window.

IF you're a high school student, or someone who doesnt go out often, then this restaurant offers a very good value for decent food.  If however you are someone who has traveled and tasted all sorts of restaurants then this will feel very average.  Sausages are nothing unique, pancakes are from a normal store bought batter (and you can taste that in their waffles), bread is not home baked, etc.  You essentially get items that can be purchased at a local supermarket and nothing that comes from farms, fisheries, bakeries or butchers.\\n\\nWith that said, I have to say that the food is good, but average.  Service is good and the quantities are very good.  I've eaten there twice and simply wasn't wowed yet.

The ambiance is great - casual but upscale. \\n\\nDrinks, the second most important part of the meal. They seem to be known for their whiskey and bourbon, but they had plenty to satisfy this vodka loving girl. My group also decided that we wanted to try some of the whiskey, and decided to really go for it and get the specialty whiskey that was 122 proof, because why not?  At this point, the manager (who's name I cannot remember, but he was great!) came over to check on us. We told him of our plan and he was just as excited as we were. We placed our order and got our drinks, and took the shots. And they were....smooth. Not the burning feeling that you would expect with a 122 proof shot. So of course, we thought we were badasses for being able to take the shot with no problem. A few minutes later, the manager comes back and apologizes because when he saw us take the shots, and saw that it didn't burn, he checked with the bar and discovered that we were given the wrong shot. Now lets be clear, there is no real reason he had to do that. We were happy with what we got and would have never known the difference if the manager didn't inquire at the bar and inform us. I mean, that is pretty amazing. Even if my food wasn't good (which it was, we'll get there....) I think that is worthy of 5 stars. He brought over his bar manager, who also apologized profusely, and poured us the correct shot. And let me be clear, we are NOT badasses and it burned, but was also awesome. \\n\\nSo now that I was all liquored up on two shots and drink, let's get to the food. We had the gator tacos to start - which were amazing. Perfect little bites of delicious flavor, I would probably order them as a meal next time. For the main course - we had the chicken and waffles, ribs, and the Frogmore Stew. All were excellent. The chicken was very crispy, and the waffle was flavorful. I do wish that the syrup had been a little sweeter instead of spicy to balance it out, but overall it was great. The ribs were phenomenal, fall off the bone and covered in delicious sauce. I was told the stew was amazing, but was unable to sneak a bite because my friend ate it up so fast. \\n\\nAnd now on the first most important part of the meal - dessert. We all shared a piece of pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. We could barely eat anything else at this point, but the manager (who checked on us frequently throughout the meal) told us that they are all made fresh every day. It was worth it. The pie was perfectly sweet, the crust was delectable and crispy, warmed up with the melting ice cream. \\n\\nOverall - a great experience. This will definitely become a regular spot."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"There's nothing croissant-y about their chocolate croissant.

When the waitress was there, she just wanted to talk about how needed she was by the other staff because they don't know anything. The real absurdity came when they started testing these club style LED light strips. One was focused directly at my wife and was blinding her and there were at least 3 of them flashing. I had to yell across to floor where there was some DJ setup and asked him to knock it off. The waitress let us know that once the kitchen closes they turn the place into a dance club. \\n\\nAs for the food, it was unremarkable. For apps I had oysters and my wife had a beet salad and they were fine (kind of hard to mess up raw oysters). For the entree I had the lamb shank and she had the filet mignon. My lamb shank was fine but there were hard as rock uncooked beans mixed in with the perfectly cooked ones. How does that even happen?

There was a truck here once before, but it mysteriously vanished. You can read more about that in my review of End Zone. Needless to say, with a stark lack of taco trucks in this area, I was overjoyed to find another truck at this location, and eager to try it. So within days of discovering it, I made the trek out for lunch. \\n\\nLike most authentic trucks (Juniors is the exception that proves the rule), there is very little by way of vegetarian friendly items. However, the staff were more than happy to accommodate me upon hearing my dietary restrictions. I asked the price of a quesadilla, the only menu item missing a price, and was told $6 for chicken, etc. I asked how much \\"con solo vegetales\\" and was quoted $5. Not bad, not bad. I then asked just to make sure that the sopes didn't have meat in them, and upon confirmation, ordered one of those as well. My total came to $8.50. The guy behind the counter seemed genuinely appreciative to have the business, gave me an extra sauce and a biz card to take home. \\n\\nMy total was apparently a great deal because, as it turned out, I ordered entirely too much food. I had no idea the quesadilla would be as big as it was. He explained that they make a quesadilla with two shells, and put all the stuff in the middle (as opposed to folding one shell over). What I did not know was they use thicker, Mexican-style tortillas, instead of tex-mex, thinner ones. And the veggies were piling out all over the box. Too much food or not, I devoured every bite. I foresee this being a regular lunch option. Next time I'll leave out the sope. It was good, but just too much food. \\n\\nOh, bonus: LATE hours!

I found the cheese cake itself was not sweet enough, but when taken with the coulis and mousse cream, it was fine. I guess I would have preferred a more stand alone kind of cake. \\n\\nThe service was excellent.

The sausage is mild, with the perfect amount of seasoning. Juicy and flavorful. The biggest surprise is the broccoli rabe on which it sits. I love broccoli but hate broccoli rabe. In my past experience it is very bitter and off putting. Rino's has completely flipped the script. Their version has zero bitter taste and is cooked perfectly tender, probably more enjoyable than any plain broccoli I've ever had. Where has this been all my life? \\n\\nLobster ravioli: the far and away most popular dish on the menu. No need to be wordy, it's the perfect marriage of seafood and pasta. Fresh hand made ravioli with generous lumps of cheese and lobster swimming in saucey goodness.....enough said. \\n\\nRino's is far and away the top Italian destination in Eastie, and better than anything I've had in the north end (yes I said it!)

There are many bun options which is great but all of them are so damn large in proportion to the patty which diminishes the correct patty to bun ratio that a true burger enthusiast demands.  It's practically a large ground beef kolache!  The mixed potato and sweet potato fries is nice touch that differentiates Phil's from the typical burger joint offerings.

I went here back in April with my boyfriend and another couple. It was the weekend, so we knew it would be busy. We were told that there was a 2 hour wait, which we were fine with. We went over to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. My boyfriend ordered a couple of drinks for us, and the bartender asked if we'd like to keep a tab open, and figuring that it would be easier for the bartender, we said sure, at which point she said she needed a credit card to keep the tab open. We handed her a credit card and explained we did not want to use the card and would be paying cash when we were finished and she said that would be ok.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I had 2 drinks each, and then asked for our tab. A couple of minutes later the bartender comes over with the little black book with our check AND the 2 credit card slips from running our card! We stopped her and said, \\"no, we told you we were gonna pay cash\\" so she grabbed the credit card slips and the receipt, wadded them up and the threw them in the trash, and told us that she had not put the transaction through yet so we could still pay cash. The total was $40. We were charged $10 each for our drinks and before she threw the receipt out we noticed she had charged us for large drinks. We mentioned that to her and said we did not ask for large drinks nor did we want large drinks, and her response was a bit ridiculous.... \\"the other glasses are dirty. Those are the only glasses we have right now, sorry.\\" They should be telling patrons that beforehand.\\n\\nAnyway, so we pay with cash, the $40 plus tip and head over to the bowling side. When we go up to get our shoes, we are then told that we can only play 2 games since there was a wait. After waiting more than 2 hours, they should have told us that in the beginning. We still stayed, and were only able to play one game because our lane kept malfunctioning. When we were done, we went up to pay. You also have to leave a card at the front when you get your shoes, etc. Again, we were paying cash and asked for our card back, while we had cash in hand. The girl at the front was incredibly rude and refused to give us the card until we physically handed the cash over. She treated us like we were criminals and we were gonna run out the door. The whole experience was pretty awful. \\n\\nA few weeks later, when my boyfriend received his credit card statement, he noticed a $40 charge from Kings even though we paid cash and never signed any credit card receipt! He called Kings to dispute and they were very difficult, asking if he had a receipt. No, he didn't b/c the bartender threw it away when she wadded up our credit card slips. We asked Kings to produce a signed credit card slip, knowing full and well that they could not b/c we never signed one. They wouldn't budge and it took months of going back and forth with the credit card company before we were able to get the money back. Again, be very careful with this place. I will not be going back, ever. Shady company."},{"name":"Urban Gate","address":"1158 The High Street, Suite 102","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3","text":"So...probably the last update I'm going to do on this place, unless something extraordinary happens.  I stand by my other two reviews.  The grocery part is fantastic for very unique Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food finds if you live in the area like I do and the bakery section is great, cheap fix for an otherwise expensive sweet tooth craving.  They still use good quality, fresh cream in a lot of their pastries.  Also, if you catch a good sale, you can get pretty good deals on dairy and meats.  Fresh produce, not so much.  I find the quality to be somewhat lacking.  Might also be because I'm not a Chinese grandmother who goes to \\"market\\" really early in the morning.  I get the feeling it's slim pickins whenever I go past 5PM.\\n\\nThe restaurant part?  You need to take it with a grain of salt.  It definitely is one of those schizophrenic neighbourhood joints that just somehow works.  Sometimes it's a downtown bar lounge, sometimes a Canadian pub, other times a Persian restaurant.  Also other times when I feel like I just walked into my Persian best friend's grandmother's dining room when they're having a reunion.  Nobody knows what the hell this place is but it just works.  Case in point, I ordered honey garlic chicken wings with blue cheese dip last night.  I got (positively...) teriyaki wings with ranch dip.  It was still great for a late night deep fried craving.  Service could be better but most of their food is really not bad.  I'd still trek all the way to North Van for great Persian food.  So chill, don't set the bar high, and enjoy it for what it is, a quick and easy choice in the neighbourhood if you're hungry."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I had a taxing week handling issues with our sick grandmother, we wanted a place that was uplifting and enjoyable.

The line is consistently out the door during the AM rush, but here's the weird thing - it moves so quickly that I don't even hesitate to jump in a line that at any other establishment I would run screaming from.

This place requires you to wait in line to order, but then your wait for a drink is usually non-existent or within a couple minutes tops.  My go-to drink in the cold winter months is a grande decaf caramel macchiatto and it doesn't matter who the barista is, I can always count on it tasting precisely the same.  My husband finally caught me up technologically so I now pay using my phone which is a breeze.

I am always chatting it up in real life that I guess I thought I had done so here too. Anyways, this to me is a fantastic spot and one that I love taking out of towners to as it has a nice environment (you can really soak in the fresh air of Central Texas) with good people watching and fantastic, unique brews. It's a great place to come spend the afternoon - usually there is live music, kids playing, dogs chilling, and good beer sipping. You can do a free tour, which is worth it to understand how the beer is made and how they collaborate with other alcohol vendors in the area to share barrels, etc. It's not fancy, but that's part of the charm. The beer menu rotates regularly, so it's great to come back and try something new or an old favorite (if they have it). Plenty of options for where to purchase - both indoor and outdoor bars - and they will hold the tab open for you if you want it and enable you to purchase either inside or outside. Read the menu carefully - some are available in taster sizes and some are full pours - some are only available inside, so be forewarned. But, all in all, I can't say anything negative about this place. It's a little ways out of downtown, but well worth it for the full Jester King experience. Some of my favorite beers include Das Wunderkind!, Provenance - Orange & Grapefruit and Ambr√©e. What are you waiting for? Get out to Jester King and give their beers a taste.
