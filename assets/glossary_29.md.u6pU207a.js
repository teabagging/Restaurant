Sat at the bar with no problem at all, and glad I did.  First, this was my second time to the restaurant, and both times the food did not disappoint. However, sitting at the bar this past visit allowed me to learn from Ryan the bartender. This guy knows his craft, and what he stocks in his liquor collection is what I would refer to in the wine tasting arena as the library selection. Not sure if the terminology is the same for liquor. Regardless, his collection includes rare, hard to find liquor and then he pairs it with some incredible scratch made mixes. After a few cocktails and some much needed education on liquor, Ryan has opened my eyes to not only taste the difference, but understand the difference between a bar whose bartenders' know enough to mix an average cocktail, and the bartender who can pair and layer flavors.  When you're thirsty for a finely crafted cocktail and great food, head over to Veritas, sit at the bar and surrender yourself to Ryan who will fix you a cocktail you'll not forget.

He had arrived ahead of me and was already at one of the tables. Isabella, her husband and Mike were all there and without missing a beat we were greeted like family. I would not expect anything else from Isabella based on all of the warm things I have heard about her from others I know. She is just so warm and friendly I could visit with her all day.We were told about the new focaccia pizza and of course were given a piece to try. My only complaint is my mouth does not open wider but that was one of the best tasting focaccia breads I have ever had and it was topped with an old school dusting of cheese, some basil, garlic, olive oil and decorated with a slice of tomato and an garlic basil mixture that I could have just eaten by itself. That first bite I was simply unprepared for because the texture of the focaccia was like biting into a crispy piece of heaven. It just collapses in your mouth in a wonderful way. That is just something you simply have to try for yourself but that is one of the best creations I have bitten into. That was a home run in my book now I will just have to work on opening my big mouth up a little wider. GIGGLEI feasted on the \\"Tuesday Trio\\" and a side of polenta which was three different meatballs and a salad. I ordered the vegan since I have not tried that one the first time I dined here. The traditional and sausage were also ordered and you can go read my first review about them because they were just as good this time as the last time. The vegan meatball was surprisingly good but my only real complaint was that it fell apart. This might upset a few vegans but it took me a minute to realize that it was not real meat. I don't want to know what was in it but I will say that it could make me stray from the need for incisors on occasion. WINKAfter lunch Isabella took time to tell us all about her photos on the wall and I could have let her talk for hours. If I had a half a lick of sense I would have recorded it on video and posted it but I was so into hearing about her family history I did not think about it until she was almost done. I say this with love...  She can talk me under the table and that is no easy task but she is so fun top listen to I actually shut up and just let her do the talking. I told her husband they should have a \\"Meatball challenge\\" which is 1 pound EACH of ALL of their meatballs, an order of all of their sides a cannoli and finally a dish of gelato and give them 30 minutes to eat it all. If they do, they get their picture on the \\"Meatball Wall of Fame\\" and a T Shirt saying they won the challenge and their meal is on The Meatball Shoppe and if they lose, it costs them $200 which of which half of it is donated to charity. Either way it is bragging rights or a donation to charity so everybody wins!I also remembered to give Isabella the hug Antoinella made me promise to give her when I last saw her at Stefanos Trattoria. This was another great meal with great people in a mom n pop establishment. I wish EVERY lunch was this full of love!

When I lived in nyc, I would visit juice generation frequently for their Joyful Almond smoothie and Island Live sounded similar to it with common ingredients like coconut, chia, and almond milk.

I made online reservations (minimum to make a reservation is a party of 6), using my credit card through their online reservation site (I think Caviar.com, but it's linked to their own website proper).We had 3 orders of the wings, one spicy, one not spicy, the long bean chicken salad and the claypot with pork belly, shrimp and vermicelli noodles.The wings were not spicy at all, but the \\"spicy\\" wings were more flavorful in that they weren't too sweet like the non spicy wings. I also noticed in some pictures and can confirm in reality that they leave pieces of the wing feathers on the wings. I'm not sure if this is a thai type of treatment, but I consider having feather pieces with my wings as somewhat unsanitary (though it's probably perfectly okay to digest them).  Overall the wings were the best part of the meal, and probably because I'm from northern california, I didn't think it was really worth the cost, the wait or the hype.  There are multiple places in San Francisco that are better in my own culinary opinion, and I would have much rather had a second meal at the amazing Screen Door for brunch instead.

They were so salty to the point I couldn't eat more than one or two without having to down glasses of water or eat mouthfuls of plain carbs or veggies. Vancouver has far better wings, make the drive up and come to Phnom Penh instead for Vietnamese/Cambodian style wings that are made far better.The boar meat was decent but they warned us this would be extremely spicy and it was just average. My favourite dish of the day had to be the glass noodles in a claypot with shrimp and pork. Super yummy and finally had a balance of flavours that wasn't just salt, salt and more salt. The thai iced tea here was also pretty good but not anything particularly different to other thai iced teas!"},{"name":"Oath Pizza - Coolidge Corner","address":"276 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"OATH!!!! This bad boy just opened up in Coolidge Corner last week, so I had to pop on by. I wondered what could a third pizza joint in a one block radius could offer Coolidge Corner and was pleasantly surprised. Off the bay, you're greeted with a very clean and aesthetically pleasing interior. Wooden tables, industrial seats, and a draft soda machine that will make you look twice. As far as the pizza goes, I built my own and piled on a bunch of mismatched goodies, and the result was exactly what I was looking for. As a fairly large man myself, the Whole pizza was plenty for me. One more slice and I might've been pushed over the edge, but the six just hit the spot. The quality of the ingredients is what separated this pizza apart, I do wish they could have been a little more generous with the ingredients themselves but you are not limited when you build your own so that's a trade off. The crust was impressive which claims to be made with pure grain north dakota mills flour and avocado oil. I've never had either but I am a fan!!

The menu is pretty big but some dishes were better than other. (We ordered 12 dishes so that was basically half of the menu). (+++) Fried Chicken Wing. I do have to give this place its credit for the fried chicken wing. Ask for spicy if you can handle it (and by handling it, I mean that you have to be pretty into spicy food. If you're borderline, go for the regular wings). The chicken was flavored nicely and with the perfect amount of spicy for me. GET THIS . (+) Mushroom Salad. (Het Paa Naam Tok). Probably my second favorite dish of the night. The salad was light. I also love mushroom so I'm a bit biased toward all of the other salads that we tried.(/) Cha Ca La Vong. Meh, I'm Vietnamese and this dish did not impress me at all. The fish wasn't properly seasoned and the sauce that accompanied the dish was very bland. Overall, you can definitely get this elsewhere. Other dishes that we tried: Kung Op Wun Sen (Prawns and noodles), Chicken Kao Soi  (Chicken Curry), Papaya Pok Pok (Green Papaya Salad), Kaeng Hang Leh (Pork Belly), Hoi Thwat, etc. Overall, all of these dishes didn't really stand out. If you're coming with a big group, I recommend getting the fried chicken to share and then getting your own personal dish. These are def not family style so you won't be able to truly enjoy each dish unless you double it on them** .The customer service was alright, not exceptional. The food did come out extremely quick (I'm guessing that the food was pre-cooked and just heated up when we ordered it). The place is also not the cleanest place.

It was a very busy day the front desk lady took my order sheet and told me about 35 minutes, so I left the restaurant set my timer to 30 minutes and went to Walmart. After 35 minutes had passed people had died down a little bit I asked the front desk lady is my order ready, she said no and asked me to leave a number and she will call me. I left my number and went back to my car and waited another 15 minutes still haven't gotten a call. So, I went back in the restaurant and ask the front desk lady, she said still need to wait. I waited about another 15 minutes or so, then one of the staff came over and said to me \\" are you the one waiting for the pick up?\\" I said,\\"yes!\\" Then he's like I'm sorry in advance if I miss any of your orders. I was like \\"what?\\" Then the front desk lady reassured me that the Oder is double checked it should be fine. By now the front desk lady bought some orders out and told me it's missing one order that's why we care waiting on that one and if I want to double check the orders feel free to do so. Well, honestly after what the other staff told me that he doesn't know if all orders are in gave me a very disappointing view of the place and how can you tell your customer that. Therefore I did check each order and there were missing more than one order like the front desk lady said but towards the end we got all orders correct and that took more than 1 hour wait! Finally we got home started eating and celebrate Father's Day, my Dad bite into the stuffed bean curd skin and found a steel wool fragment inside! I was very upset that it took so long for the food and now there's a piece of steel wool in the food! What a disappointment of this place! I wonder what's the cleanliness of the kitchen.

(Although I love pizza, so I am always looking for a challenger). I have been going here since a little girl as my dad lived in Bexley. I can be very picky about my pizza sauces (I'm always an \\"extra sauce\\" girl), but Rubino's makes the cut. It's a great, rich/hearty pizza sauce. I also like that the pepperonis are crispy ones. Delicious! To me, the best part about Rubino's is the thin, flaky, almost cracker-like crust. It's not for everyone, but I definitely enjoy it. I actually picked up some Rubino's pizzas for a friend of mine that had moved from Italy to Ohio and his statement was \\"For the 4 years I've lived in Ohio, this is the best pizza I've had.\\" They were also voted as best pizza in the state a few years back!I live downtown now, but every Sunday I am in Bexley, so many-a-time I will call Rubino's ahead of time and ask them to have my pizza ready for me at a certain time. They always pull through!Lastly, I love the old school look and feel of Rubino's (albeit again, it's not for everyone). When you call in your order, the main guy (possibly the owner) just writes it on a big yellow notepad. Nothing techy at all about their processes. Their cash register looks like it's from 1952. And they only accept cash or check. I have paid check many times and they do a great job of cashing them almost immediately. When you dine inside, you feel like you're in a 1960's mom & pop pizzeria in NYC. It's a nice break from the hustle and bustle of every day life, which I appreciate.

They have a decent selection of local beer and a variety of food options to make everyone happy. I really wanted to some crab legs, but a Dungeness crab was over $75 and that's a bit steep from my experience. So I went for their Surf and Turf special, a steak and half Dungeness Crab legs. It was mediocre at best. I had asked for the steak to be done medium and it more like well done and tough to chew. Also, they couldn't quite verify what cut of steak it was. The crab leg were not what I was hoping for, but it definitely made me happy that I didn't order the $75 option. I would have been so disappointed. Not sure if the way they steamed it, but it had no flavor and it was rubbery. Good crab legs should be buttery - without the butter dip. \\nThe mashed potatoes were, by far, the best part of the meal. It wasn't horrible, but it really wasn't anything special.

This place would have 5-stars if it weren't for the rotten customer service! - which is a consistent theme in their reviews. The first time here, my boyfriend and I came in on a gross Sunday where the brewpub was nearly empty. I ordered a Bloody Mary - but for whatever reason, the bartendress came back with two (my boyfriend hadn't ordered one, or anything for that matter yet) He let it slide, and just drank it. While we sat at the bar, the bartendress went on to bad mouth Yelp and past patrons of Oak Brewpub - needless to say, she wasn't very open to any form of constructive criticism. Ignoring her, this experience was a 4. I returned to Oak Brewpub during Porchfest, where they were set up out front serving select items. The same bartendress from before was taking the orders, and it became crystal clear - this girl just has NO real training. First, I was told by her I had to pay cash. After doing so, I saw that people were going inside to pay with a card and bringing the ticket back out front. So for people that paid cash with her, she was writing down all the orders on her pad, but wasn't creating tickets for the cook. She had NO CLUE who ordered what - it was a free for all. After standing in the dollar tree parking lot for over 10 minutes waiting for my food - I inquired when it would be ready (remember this was a predetermined menu of quick food items) I was snipply told that it takes longer and would be ready shortly. If that was the case, it would have been nice to know that before I ordered. So 15 minutes later, I got my pulled pork sandwich. It was great - but they had successful put me in a bad mood at such a happy event. Would love to see them bring in help with regards to customer service training.

I think this is one of the very few places that serve takoyaki, so if you are craving for some takoyaki, go here.The downside is the lack of seats. You cannot reserve a seat, and when you go there, the server needs to see everybody in your group before you can get seats. One day, Friday afternoon my family of four wanted to eat here and was told that we would've waited 50 minutes. We decided to not eat here.. If you come only by yourself, then the chance of getting a seat quickly is higher you can get seated at the bar.

Notice that qualification, sushi BUFFET, not just sushi.  I think where Nori Nori really shines is in the fact that their buffet is so large and extensive, most anyone can find something they like.  If you can't find one thing on this massive buffet you like, you have issues cuz they have everything.  Seriously I think I saw hot wings.    I'm convinced even people who don't like sushi would find plenty to eat on the buffet.  The crepe station was a big hit in our group, much more so than the green tea ice cream, which didn't taste like green tea to me.    This makes Nori Nori a great place to bring a group of people, the seating area is large enough to handle large groups and the food is varied enough to satisfy most everyone. Also another big  hit, our server had no issues splitting the check up by person even though it was a large group.  This was key as I did not want to have to figure out who owed what in a group that large.  I also think if people are on diet restrictions they could still eat well at Nori Nori , I know I'm on the Paleo diet right now (eat like a cave man) and I can eat pretty well at Nori Nori.  Some sashimi, crab legs,  fruit, asparagus, bok choy, and salad, YUM.

I didn't realize until we got there that the restaurant has actually been featured on DDD with Guy Fieri which raised my expectations for the food since everything featured on the show looks bomb.I love variety in my food so I was super excited when I saw the different types of meatballs and obviously went for the Trio which included three different types of meatballs of your choice, a side(or base really) and salad. I chose the traditional meatball, the Mediterranean meatball, and the mac and cheese meatball with Penne and a mixture of red sauce and provolone sauce. The Mediterranean meatball and the traditional were delicious though I can't say I was a big fan of the mac and cheese but I look forward to going back and trying their other options. They also have an option on the menu where you can get the meatballs bakes on top of focaccia bread and I will certainly be trying that next time.For dessert I tried the cheesecake and the chocolate torte both with raspberry sauce on top. The cheesecake was super delicious as I expected. The chocolate torte is perfect for chocolate lovers but it was a little too much for me, it was comparable to a dark chocolate fudge (I'm not a fan of fudge which is why it wasn't my preference). The service was also really great, we were greeted warmly as soon as we walked in and made to feel comfortable. I also really appreciated how everyone in the restaurant was open to talking to you and answering any questions instead of that typical situation where people don't want to help unless they're your server.

I originally discovered this place after we came back from our trip to Louisiana obviously looking for a local place that has cajun broiled seafood and I absolutely fell in love with it. I'm a huge fan of seafood and I believe the prices here are pretty fair.We always do Combo B which allows you to pick 3 items with 2 sides. Our favorites items to get are the Shrimp (head on), Mussels and Crawfish with Garlic Noodles and Sausage as our sides. Sometimes we'll add corn as well. The Garlic Noodles are a MUST, IN THE BAG. I'm telling you, you won't regret it. And the sausage is so worth the extra money. We have tried the clams before, but enjoy the mussels way more. We used to get the Medium Louisiana style sauce, and for awhile we stuck with Medium. Until one day it was way too spicy for me (this was months ago) and I can usually handle my spice. The waitress said they had increased the spice recently because people were complaining it wasn't spicy enough. So she gave me a side of melted butter and a side of white rice to help with the spice. Dipping the seafood in melted butter helped a lot and not to mention tasted even better! They were super nice about the whole situation, needless to say we get mild now if my boyfriend and I are sharing the same bag. We have also tried their fried platters, specifically the fried oysters. They're super juicy and plump. Highly recommend if you're not big into cajun or the spicy boilers. This place has got busier and busier since our first visit and it's well deserved. Whenever we go it seems like they're understaffed. But the employees do a pretty good job keeping up with their customers. The environment is fresh and very organized. They use thick paper as table cloths for easy clean up which makes every place setting seem sanitized and clean cut.Just writing this makes me want to go back again this weekend. You cannot go wrong with this place. And if you're new to cajun cuisine then this is a perfect place to try it out. It's a fun light-hearted environment.

Then, one bright and sunny Allston morning, one of these two Vegans was on the #66 Bus when he noticed a bright sign in the distance, \\"Vegan Options.\\" So, he took note of that sign, the establishment that bared such a wonderful message, and he said to himself, \\"I will support all Vegan-friendly businesses, especially if they are a diner.One day he entered their fine establishment and ordered the Tofu Scramble with BBQ seitan and a side of pancakes. Finally, the long promised land of GREAT Vegan breakfasts had been discovered! Shortly afterwards, his partner joined him for breakfast.So, if I could design a diner, minus the flesh-eater options, Allston Diner would be a great model. The decor inside is fun and whimsical, the staff is wonderfully tattooed and friendly and Vegan-knowledgeable, comic book and Americana art adorn the inside, and the menu reflects a serious consideration by ownership of Vegan-friendly options that are as butt-kickingly great on their own, that even non-vegans would eat them. As for the the food, I have now tried nearly all of their Vegan options for breakfast and lunch and all my meals have been wonderful. Their blueberry pancakes as well as their banana pancakes are not only the BEST Vegan pancakes in the Boston-area, they are among the BEST pancakes I have had in my entire life. Their BBQ seitan is amazing with breakfast scrambles as well as wraps. The coffee is NYC-style diner-like and goes so well with the atmosphere there. I could not love this place more and I am so thrilled that I now have a local place to go to on Sundays (let's face it, more than Sundays as well) for a GREAT breakfast that is Vegan-friendly.It would be nice to see them offer Vegan-waffles in the future, and maybe chicken-fry the seitan, and then put those two things together (hint hint hint), and add a Vegan gravy for their biscuits and scramble (hint x 4), but if I could go anywhere for breakfast, in the Boston area, Allston Diner is choice #1.

It was Valentines' day, so I figured that I would go out early for their Happy Hour so I would be able to grab a table.  Morton's started in Chicago and I expected my experience to be a good one.  Not so much.  I was greeted by the desk with, \\"Do you have a reservation and are you ALONE?\\" (with sarcasm and elevated eyebrows).  I responded that I was just looking to sit at the bar for Happy Hour.  I sat a table and noted that there multiple tables with businessmen enjoying a cocktail and appetizers.  Most restaurants ignore a single woman on business but I expected more from Mortons.  Max greeted me, took my drink order and when he returned with my cocktail asked for my order.  I informed him that I would like the wedge salad bites and asked about a couple of items and chose the filet bites.  I waited...waited...waited...water glass was refilled by the busboy, my cocktail was left empty.  I received the filet bites, enjoyed them and waited and waited again.  The servers were attentive to the other tables, refilling cocktails, serving appetizers and asking if they were needing anything else.  The Busboy came by again to refill my water.  Max came back and I asked about the salad.  He tried to turf it off by saying that I must have ordered my order with the other bartender, and I reminded him that it was he who took my order.  Suddenly he remembered and told me that he thought I asked to not order the salad.  I informed him that I just wanted the check and to leave.

I'm glad I placed a reservation since they were still busy at 10pm and I heard a lady complaining that they've been waiting in line for \\"3 years\\".  It's a nice, modern restaurant and we were underdressed since we just got in from Springfield, MA with a small piece of luggage in tow and had no time to go back to the hotel to change and get ready.  But they didn't kick us out or anything, they even stored our luggage for us. Excellent service from the hostess, server, bussers and bartender who were all very pleasant.We ordered the clam chowder, lobster roe noodles, oysters, oyster slider, shrimp cocktail, buttermilk biscuit, complimentary mini whoopie pies and moroccan mint tea.Clam Chowder:\\nThe BEST clam chowder I've EVER had.  It has bacon, buttermilk biscuit pieces, potato and of course, clams. The bacon was a very nice touch. Loved every single drop. 5/5Lobster Roe Noodles:\\nLobster, braised short rib, pecorino and oyster mushrooms. The slightly chewy texture of lobster and the meaty goodness of the short rib parallels the texture and flavor of the oyster mushrooms. Superb! 5/5Oysters and Shrimp Cocktail:\\nOur server helped us pick our variety.  We got the Island Creek, Chatham, Dodge Cove, Wawenauk, Rocky Nook and Shrimp Cocktail. Each from $2.50-3.50. All from Massachusetts or Maine. Excellent quality oysters. They were fresh and clean-tasting without losing the briny taste.  The saltiest of the group was Chatham followed by Rocky Nook and Wawenauk. Island Creek and Dodge Cove were milder and sweeter. My favorite was Wawenauk since the saltiness is just right. They come with lemon, cocktail sauce, and a sauce that tasted like white wine with horseradish...and condiments on your table. Honestly, no need for shenanigans. The shrimp was huuuge, mildly sweet and succulent. 5/5Oyster Slider:\\nFried oyster with chile lime aioli on brioche. Fresh oysters fried to perfection and the aioli was the perfect match. I could've eaten 5 of these. 5/5Buttermilk Biscuit:\\nI was going to order dessert until I remembered I had ordered a biscuit. Fluffy buttery inside, crunchy outside...drizzled with honey.  This huge dessert I paired with my favorite Moroccan mint tea. 5/5We considered coming back here the next evening but we already made a reservation somewhere else.

It's hard to describe how it looks like, I digress. One really strange thing is, you gotta try their water. It is very refreshing with a little hint of coconut flavor.

The prawns lacked the caramelization flavor and should have been more marinated. The muong noodle(commonly used in Chinese/Taiwanese dishes) were cooked on the bottom of the pot and had sucked all the flavors and saltiness. It was good, but just could have been so much better. Boar's collar were kinda disappointing as well. It's served with chilled leaves on ice (on the side). The boar itself was lacking in flavor. The stuff they put on top was just too overpowering.

The first time I came here with two other girlfriends a few years back and we ordered two dozens or so of oysters. No drinks and nothing else. Our waiter wasn't happy that it wasn't a big bill. The oysters on the other hand were fresh and amazing. Island creek by far was one of my favorite followed by wellfleet. We paid around $3-4 for each, so it was a big bill for us as we just graduated from college.My second visit here was very recent - last night. We made reservations for two at 9:30pm to celebrate our 8 year anniversary. Both of us worked for 10 hours straight and wanted to have a nice meal to commemorate the milestones we have achieved together, so we were looking forward to dinner. We each got a drink and then were led to our table punctually. I saw the raw bar menu and had to ask our waitress a few questions about the oysters since there were so many options. She definitely didn't want to be there and I know it was late and I had a lot of questions, but it wasn't a very good attitude to give your customers. Anyway, we got the island creek, beach point, oyster point, Hama Hama and some others. They were just as good as the ones I had a few years back - fresh and top notched quality. The other items we got were lobster bisque (very good), smoked tuna pate (interesting and healthier than chicken liver), lobster roll (heavy roll but didn't like the meat cold and the massive amount of celery overpowering the lobster flavor), and fried clams (the batter was very good - light and savory). We got our bill (close to $200 with drinks and tips) and left the restaurant without so much of an acknowledge from our waitress. No good-bye or thank you for coming. Did I mention she had a sour look on her face the entire night and not even a small smile at us?"},{"name":"Smoke Ring","address":"309 Nelson St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I work downtown, the day was beautiful, I was craving BBQ and Smoke Ring was only a mile and a half walk from the office, so I thought I'd give it a try today.When I arrived, I was instantly and warmly greeted and led to a nice little window-seat table for one.  I settled in and if I had only one bad thing to say in this review, it's that it took a while for someone to come to me.  But then the gentleman who seated me (who was also working behind the bar) noticed and made a point to come over to get me a drink and explained my server would be right with me.  I looked around and saw my server had an awful lot of tables....so that was understandable, especially when someone else came over to make sure I was ok. (After a mile and a half walk? Yes, I did need that water - thank you!)And from there, it only got better.  The server I had was truly a gem and, even busy, did not make me feel rushed.  Very personable and friendly.  There's a very good vibe here.The food, then.  I opted for the two meats + two sides and got the pulled pork and brisket with the maple baked beans and three cheese macaroni.  Folks, the macaroni and cheese is *to die for* -- it's fantastic! The beans were good too, but a little liquidy for my taste: I was expecting something a bit thicker by the description on the menu. They're still very tasty: just expect them to come out in a bowl in a liquid base and you'll like them just fine.As for the meat? Oh, good heavens.  Both the pulled pork and brisket were delicious.  They also offer three different sauces in bottles at your table (I'm a sweet BBQ sauce girl myself, and I'd be open to buying some of this to take home myself, it's that good!).  The portions are crazy ample.  The price point for this meal was $17, but eating my fill and with a whole box of leftovers after eating my fill, it's very reasonable.  I will definitely be back again."},{"name":"Zed's","address":"501 Canyon Ridge Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"2nd verse!  Same as the first!I decided to give the \\"new\\" Zed's a try.  After a lackluster meal a year or so ago, i was lured in with hopes of a different experience.  ( i will give them credit, tho. After my 1st review i was contacted by a manager and sent a certificate for $20 of  food.  No alcohol could be purchased with it, it expired in a year and there was a notice that 18% gratuity would be added -in Huge font at the bottom.  ?? Thanks, i guess?  I never redeemed it.So, on this night a bestie had posted a picture of an amazing looking salad on Facebook and i got salad envy.  Zed's was close to home and they had a good looking (sounding) salad on the menu.  Sigh.  OK, fine.  We would make it in time for happy hour and ... OK, whatever, let's just go.  The hostess was super friendly and told us it was open seating at the bar.  It doesn't look like they have really done anything to distinguish it from the old Zeds.  Same decor, tables and the same crappy service.  The bf and i sat at a table and were promptly ignored by the staff .  I did the whole \\"i'm staring at you, will you please at least bring me a menu\\" act and finally the guy came over.  They do have a decent happy hour.  1/2 priced apps and beer, wine and cocktails specials that are 4 or 5 bucks.  The bf hated his mojito and my martini wasn't very dirty.  Whateves, no one bothered to check on us, we just drank them.  We ordered 2 apps, a side of brussel sprouts and that salad that made me go there.  The food came out pretty quickly, but at different times.  Sorta weird, but OK. Food runners brought the food out, again, no one checked on us.  Cute bf was happy with the tuna, i thought it was fishy and only had one bite.  We had the grilled artichokes and they were OK, you could really only eat the hearts tho.  The brussel sprouts were good, but are called \\"crispy\\" in the description.  There was not much \\"crispy\\" about it.  We love sprouts, tho, so we were happy to eat them.So.  the salad.  le sigh.  Deja vu set in.  The last time i had a salad at Zeds, it was missing ingredients and stingy with others.  The salad came out and looked decent.  I had asked for the greens to be just spinach, but apparently that is not an option.  On the menu, it is described as: Cherries, feta, cashews, & apple tossed with citrus vinaigrette.  OK.  so i saw apples on top and the sprinkle of feta.  Where are the cashews?  Oh, there 2 are!  yay!  Where are the cherries?...  The bf dug around in it and pointed out a spec.  Is that a cherry?  Oh, so what they meant to say was dried cherries.  Chopped into tiny pieces.  Also, it was not dressed properly, where was the citrus vinaigrette?!  How hard is it to make a salad people?  Apparently it is not Zed's forte.It was nearing the end of happy hour and we wanted to get another drink.  The guy that had taken our order originally continued to straight up ignore us.  He walked past us to take drink orders from a table behind us and past us again to go back to the bar.  He blatantly ignored the bf when he attempted to get his attention on his stroll back to the bar. Uhhhh, really?  Bf finally just went to the bar, and stood for several minutes trying to place an order.  A different staff member helped him, because apparently we are now invisible to the guy \\"that was going to be helping us out that night\\".  It then took another 10 mins for the drinks to be delivered.  The 2nd staff member actually cared and apologized for our having to wait so long to get service.So, yeah.  Not really happy with the $50 bucks or time i wasted at Zed's.  I'm big on customer service.  Yes it was happy hour, yes there were other customers, but it was by no means packed.  It was hard to justify the fact that the guy \\"that was going to help us out that night\\" totally ignored us after first taking our order.  Oh, but he was happy to show up with the check, tho!  The bf who Always tips did not want to leave a tip.  I didn't want the other employees that HAD helped us to suffer tho.  Hopefully they tip share at the bar.Cute bf has a saying:  \\"it's whatever\\".  I actually hate it when he says that, but he summed it up perfectly that night with \\"it was a big o pile of whatever\\".  He also wanted to go to McDonald's to get a hamburger.  /huge eye roll.  4 dishes, 4 drinks and $50 bucks and he would rather have gone to McDonald's. Yeeeeah.  Just. No.  Zed's you are doing it wrong.  (still.)oh.  And besties salad?  She got it at HEB.  I sooooo could have saved myself $45 bucks."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great drinks and great healthy food. No complaints.

I decided to grab a sandwich to take to my gate, and I'm glad I did.  The Cubano I got from here was the best one I've ever had.  Granted, I don't exacly come from a hotspot of Cuban cuisine, but the pork was what set this sandwich apart. I have no idea how authentic this is, but the pork was slow cooked and pulled apart (in contrast to slices when I've had these sandwiches elsewhere), completely infused with delicious garlicky seasoning.  The sandwich was about $10, but was huge -- I could only eat half of it, and ended up sticking the other half in my carry-on. I was probably the person that other air travelers complain about, what with my garlic breath and stinky food in my carry-on, but it was so worth it, and definitely more interesting than the other fast food and bar food offerings available in this terminal.

The location was relatively empty so I wasn't competing with a crowd for table space, but my order still took a while to get to the table. They have a similar set up to a Jason's Deli or the like, where you order at the counter and your food is delivered to you. I decided to try a fruity salad and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of fruit in the salad. That being said, the salad itself was simple enough in design and didn't seem that it was worth the cost - considering portion sizes and all that. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty enough, but fruit is always good and it's hard to ruin a salad that consists of leafy greens and a fruit medley. It was just very simple in flavor and nothing I would write home about or want to order again. I decided to break the rules and try a dessert as well since it is a bakery and I figured they would have great desserts. I was torn between the lemon bar and the maple pecan bar, but they recommended the maple pecan so I decided to order that instead. It was......not worth it. In all honesty, the maple pecan bar was a huge disappointment. No flavor of maple, not even a hint. It pretty much tasted like a pecan pie square and was decent enough, but nothing special. I wish I hadn't ordered it and if I come here again I'd like to try the lemon bar. My takeaway was this... it's a decent enough place to grab a bite but there are far better places to go that offer a better value and better food. The food is quite simple in flavor and won't excite the tastebuds in any way, shape, or form. I probably won't come back here because I wasn't impressed by any point of my meal beyond the quantity of fruit in my salad. Yippee.

Salmon is so cheap now, and anyone can make better salmon at home.*A medium well filet came out butterflied without notice.  The filet wasn't nearly thick enough to necessitate butterflying, and the medium well preparation was far past very well done.  I cook a lot of filets at home for people who want varying temperatures, and it's not hard to, but apparently Mitchell's doesn't know how.*One companion did like her steak, and it was cooked a perfect medium.*Had the \\"special\\" lobster mac and cheese.  I'm not sure if it was real lobster or crab de-lites from Kroger meat aisle (likely was lobster, from several days ago they thawed too much of.)  Mac and cheese was shockingly disappointing--was made with processed cheese.  I would expect a better preparation at this cost--with a real cheese sauce based in a b√©chamel.  This was just beyond absurd for a supposed nice restaurant to serve neon orange/yellow mac and cheese.  It had a smoked flavor so am assuming they used processed smoked gouda along with velveeta.*Ordered a glass of white wine that tasted like a bottom of the shelf NV blend you might be served on an airplane.  Taste was off, bitter, metallic, am guessing the bottle had been opened for a while.*The creme br√ªl√©e lacked a key ingredient--heavy cream and real vanilla.  We could tell it was made from a powdered mix--similar to the Dr Oetker's mixes you can buy at Kroger.  We have made real CB at home as well as with various mixing pouches.  This was made with a mix--consistency and flavor is vastly different when made properly.  People who never eat CB or who have never made it may not notice but we did.  It's an expensive dessert to make if done properly and with good ingredients.  Good ingredients weren't used here, or if they were, they were used sparingly.Utter waste of money.  We ate here out of convenience and thought it might be good.  My mom recalls coming here in early 2000s with my dad and she agreed this is not the same Mitchell's it once was.  Awful.  Nothing made me want to return--though I enjoyed the company that was fun.  Service was okay--but fine(er) dining should serve pepper and not leave the grinders on the table (crusted with greasy hand prints from past diners.). Overall--this place needs a makeover, and kitchen staff needs some culinary training and access to better ingredients."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I actually managed to come here when there wasn't a 9,000 person line.

When you spend $750 dollars for four people on one meal you expect certain quality of food and quality of service. You expect things...like...*The appetizer plates to be removed before the dinner plates arrive...\\n*Not to have to ask to have the crumbs brushed off a crowded and covered table...\\n*For your $100 dollar bottle of wine to actually arrive quicker than 20 minutes after you order it...and with your steaks, which is the point of the wine!\\n*For your $70 porterhouse ordered rare...not to arrive medium. And friends, there is a huge difference, a difference of cooking negligence, between rare and medium. I sent it back, I've done that only 3 or 4 times in my entire life and never imagined I'd have to do that at Mortons...especially after the waiter boastfully explains to the table before anyone ordered their steaks that temperatures arrive perfectly.

The hostess told us \\"there will be a 20 minute wait, do you want to wait?\\", which was odd given the open tables and nobody else waiting for a table but we were like \\"okay that's fine we will wait\\" and she looked displeased. I remember thinking \\"this is a little odd\\" because it literally seemed like she was trying to dissuade us from eating there, something I've never experienced before. So we sit and wait (only us waiting) maybe 4 minutes. Another group of four walks in and is seated. Our buzzer goes off and the hostess says \\"looks like we are going to be able to seat you much sooner\\". I half jokingly said \\"yes looks like the restaurant is full\\" and she replied \\"we have a lot of reservations\\", which if you can recall has to be six or more and there were PLENTY of four tops (including those that in no way could be transformed into a 6 top due to their location), so that doesn't seem to make sense. The food itself was good, not great, but good. We ended up ordering about 10 separate plates. My favorites were the octopus and steak. Least favorite were the meatballs (very plain) and croquettes. Service was okay. We had also ordered a pitcher of sangria and the server didn't bring water until the end of the meal and never offered to pour the sangria into our glasses, which I felt was a little odd.

I thought that tiramisu was my favorite dessert, but I think Chuy's Tres Leches cake is now NUMBER ONE on my dessert favorites list. It is so creamy and decadent that I have to order it every time I go!! The tres leches is spongy in texture, absorbing the savory and sweet dairy sauce that makes the dish so dangerously addicting!! Service is one of the best I've seen. My friend who referred me to this restaurant chain said that the waiter/waitress selection process is rigorous. After going there, I can see why! The staff was attentive, always glancing at our table to see if the nachos and/or sauces needed to be replenished. You definitely get your bang for your buck here because besides the entrees, you get free nachos and sauces to fill you up. Nobody will leave this place hungry!

There were many tables open and ready for seating while we waited, including the table we would eventually be seated at, which was strange. We enjoyed some mimosas and bloody Mary's prior to being seated. While my mimosa was nothing special, those who had a Bloody Mary professed that it was the best they'd ever had. Kudos in that department. Upon being seated, we were greeted with bowls of seasoned popcorn to munch on. Unique touch. We started with the pretzel appetizer. Served with a delicious pimento cheese and perfectly cooked, the pretzels were a nice way to start the meal. Three of the seven at the table dined on the chicken and waffles. It was a huge portion - an entire waffle and three large pieces of chicken - and I wish they would have offered a lunch sized option. The chicken was something special. You barely needed a knife to break into it, and while the exterior was a perfect fry and had a great crunch, the interior was moist and delicious. The waffle could have been more interesting; it was just a basic batter. Others are the table dined on sandwiches and salads and seemed to enjoy their food.

Conveniently it was a 5 minute drive from where we were staying. Not so conveniently, we needed a table for 9 on a Saturday morning, the busiest time of all. When we arrived the hostess was very friendly and happy to accommodate. We had to wait about 15 minutes, which was to be expected with a group of our size While waiting we skimmed over the menu. SO. MANY. CHOICES. too many delicious choices, in fact. They offered both breakfast and lunch fare but we all decided we were in the breakfast mood. After careful contemplation, I decided to go for the breakfast wrap. I liked that you could customize it with your veggies and cheese choices as well as wheat or flour wrap. It also came with home fries. The wrap itself was very tasty and fresh! The home fries however were the star of the show. Very thinly sliced, with flavorful seasonings and onions, served piping hot. Wow they were so good! I need Kekes recipe! The service was good throughout although a bit slow, again due to it being peak time, very busy and us being a large group.

It's a luxurious take on an easy, common ingredient soup. Another stand out was the crusted fish. It's flakey, soft, and flavorful and comes with the most delicious vegetables. There is a small amount of broth that had some hints of spicy to it. I couldn't get enough. I also had the \\"green horizon\\" cocktail. It was spicy and so so good. It's always a disappointment when a cocktail claims to have a kick and it doesn't. But the \\"Green Horizon\\" didn't disappoint. There are so many things I want to try on the menu.

The menu is limited, but if you're looking for a solid breakfast. brunch, or lunch, then you're not going to be disappointed.  I like the fact that everything is fresh, organic, and otherwise everything that every non-Portlander laughs at us for.  Since we, the PDX foodie crowd, don't give credence to the cretons who make fun of our diligence regarding good, sustainable, and otherwise non-Monsanto-altered food, places like Arleta Library will continue to do well.A few points of note:- The chef is very picky about what he puts in the food.  If the tomatoes, eggs, whatever are not up to his standards, he's not going to put them in anything he serves.  He'll substitute when it's possible, but he's very strict about the quality of the ingredients he uses.  (Yay!)- They won't serve anything with high fructose corn syrup (i.e. poisonous crap).  (Again, Yay!)- The homemade deserts they make are fantastic.  If you come here and don't at least try the macaroons, then shame on you!  (unless you're a diabetic, in which case, \\"Run, Forrest!

Definitely a great seat.We started with the pork belly appetizer and if it is offered when you go you MUST get it. A portion large enough for two it was simply amazing. Buttery soft with some little fried goodies on top this pork belly was the best I've had. If you're into meat, this is heaven!We shared a bacon spinach salad which was simple, but had a sweet dressing that was delicious.We ordered the dry aged steak for two and it was a smart move. A dude came out and served it to us table side. Cooked to medium rare it was perfection. Crispy on the outside with a salt and spice rub this steak is what you want. It comes with filet and a strip steak. My gf and I both preferred the filet since it was so soft. We got black truffle butter and peppercorn accompaniments and each had a unique flavor that was well liked.We got mashed potatoes and mac n cheese for sides and my gf said the mac n cheese was the best she's ever had. The potatoes were simple but very creamy.The waited comped my gf's dessert since it was her birthday and they put a little candle in her creme brulee.

It's part of a happening scene with neighboring restaurants like bartaco, BeetleCat, Char, and Bread & Butterfly. I was a fan of the original MF Sushi in Midtown (2002-2011). I thought they had some of the best, freshest, and highest quality sushi in Atlanta. I also remember MF Buckhead (2007-2012) with its huge, swanky digs and sexy staff.Due to financial problems, MF disappeared from Atlanta, but only for a few years. The owners, brothers Alex and Chris Kinjo, are back. In addition to MF Sushi in Inman Park, they're behind MF Bar and District 3 at Avalon and Anh's Kitchen in Midtown. MF stands for sushi chef Chris' nickname, \\"Magic Fingers.\\"The Japanese restaurant scene in Atlanta has grown since MF's early days. There's more competition especially when it comes to high-end sushi. The standards have risen. With so many superb options like Brush, O-Ku, and Umi, MF doesn't stand out like it used to. Still, it's in the upper tier of Atlanta sushi restaurants and a very good to great sushi experience can be had here.One thing that's set MF apart and characterized it is its style. The restaurants have always been stylish and trendy. The design of the place is alluring and exquisite. The staff fit the mold as they're generally attractive and good-looking. Admittedly, this gives off a sort of \\"see and be seen\\" vibe that some may see as pretentious. Past the pretense, however, is some legitimately good sushi and outstanding service.MF's dinner menu features Japanese soups and salads, sunomono (vinegar-based raw salads, $5-9 each), over 20 appetizers ($6-18 each) including items like tempura and tataki (seared/marinated raw fish), over 30 kinds of nigiri ($5-11 or market price for 2 pieces) and sashimi ($11-17 or market price for 4 pieces), MF signature nigiri ($9-11 or market price for 2 pieces), 16 kinds of special sushi rolls ($15-25 per roll), makimono (traditional rolls, $6-12 each), robata-grilled items such as eggplant miso ($8-14 each), cooked seafood and meat dishes like black cod and duck breast ($13-29 each, except for the $75 A5 wagyu toban yaki), and mochi ice cream desserts ($7 each).MF's drinks are a big seller and in addition to beer, wine, and champagne, they have a decent sake selection which contains some top-shelf junmai daiginjo varieties.We had the omakase (chef's choice multi-course dinner) which is priced at $125 per person. Here's what we got:Appetizers:\\n* Avocado balls - spicy tuna and salmon, truffle mousse\\n* Mozuku (Okinawan seaweed), fresh wasabi, quail egg\\n* Yellowtail, lemon zest, cilantro, serrano pepper, grated wasabi\\n* Salmon, truffle aioli, nikiri sauce\\n* Ankimo, cucumber, caviar, ponzu\\n* Baked lobster tempura and baked green mussels, Japanese mayo, eel sauce, masago, scallionSashimi:\\n* Madai - snapper\\n* Ocean trout\\n* Shimi saba - mackerel\\n* Chu toro - medium fatty tunaNigiri:\\n* Sake - salmon, aioli, truffle soy, black pepper, caviar\\n* Hamachi aburi - torched yellowtail, truffle soy, black pepper\\n* Chu toro aburi - torched medium fatty tuna, pepper, masago\\n* Uni - sea urchin\\n* A5 wagyu aburi - torched, dijon mustard, serrano pepper, truffle soy\\n* Kampachi - amberjack\\n* Otoro - super fatty tunaCooked:\\n* Chilean sea bassDessert:\\n* Black sesame and green tea mochi ice creamAside from the avocado balls which were a treat from Alex, each person got his/her own plate of the above items. I enjoyed MF's omakase. It was very good, but it wasn't as jaw-dropping to me as other omakase (and kaiseki) dinners I've had in Atlanta. With the exception of the mozuku, every item prepared for us could be found on the regular menu. Not that that's a bad thing, but I was expecting a bit more of an element of surprise; to try something new or different.Overall, the fish was fresh, the food flavorful, and there wasn't a single bad dish. My favorites were the nigiri. As you can see from the descriptions above, MF puts their own spin on traditional nigiri, adding ingredients like truffle soy, similar to Eight Sushi and other places. The result is some terrific tasting nigiri. The sashimi (2 pieces of each type of fish per person) was wonderful.The baked lobster and green mussel dishes, along with the Chilean sea bass, were quite rich. I liked how the mussels were chopped and placed back into their shells. While fine, the A5 wagyu was more chewy and tendony than I anticipated. Finally, I think there could have been a better attention to detail. For example, the yolk in my mozuku was served broken. At this price point, that shouldn't happen.Our omakase dinner lasted about 3 hours. While they look nice, MF's chairs aren't comfortable because they lack lower back support. Marjorie was our server and she did an excellent job. Alex came to check on us multiple times.If you can't find free parking on the street, you'll have to park in Inman Quarter's parking deck. MF does not validate. Parking cost $7 for us (2-4 hours)."},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Columbus so far.

Which they sell the cutest little reusable cups! Love them! Fun Tip: this location has a great selection of merch. I own their crew neck and LOVE IT. So soft! It's busy, parking is so weird (I honestly part at Schiller most times), you may have to wait for seating but it's so worth it. If you are meeting someone get there early so you have time to find a seat. Otherwise the line goes pretty quickly! I never have time to talk to the people behind the counter but they are always friendly and great at keeping the line moving!Also, their iconic fox is inside if you want photos with it!

After the first time I thought 'wow I'm never going back to chops or bones; this is amazing'. However, this most recent time was different.  The tuna pok√©, bone marrow and spinach salad were fantastic. However, my mother ordered the potato soup which was terrible. I ordered the 10 oz ribeye with Diane sauce on the side (because we learned on our multiple times here that the regular ribeye is of much better quality). I ordered my steak Pittsburgh style (charred outside, rare inside).  My steak came out almost grey, like it had been boiled.  I sent it back and asked what happened.  The waiter apologized said he didn't know and that it didn't look right.  They brought it back out a couple minutes later, and they had only charred it on one side.  By this point the inside was pretty much ruined. So instead of them cooking a whole new steak while everyone else was finishing their meals, I made a nice pb&J with blackberry jelly.They didn't even offer to take the steak off the bill btw.Went to chops a couple weeks later.

I scarfed down the cornbread stuffed trout along with the pimento mac and cheese (5 stars).  I had a small bite of the pecan crusted catfish -- the pecan crust is done REALLY nicely and the crawfish were a worthy match (5 stars).

It was warm, dense, sweet, and topped with ice cream and honey.

They use a fair amount of bleach which I smelled as soon as I walked through the door. The Fair: - Crepes and Desserts were okay. If I was going to eat just that at such a high price point, I might have been satisfied after eating a boatload since the portions are extremely small... The Bad: \\n1. Portion size is extremely small. Yes it is a buffet,and Yes, you can get as much as you want but even the minute portions don't look appetizing on the buffet bar. This goes for both rolls and nigiri (Sushi over Rice). 2. The service, server was ok. But we were not offered refills on our drinks which for sweet tea and coke was not great. Also the food bar Sushi Chef was just rude. We asked for more Salmon Sashimi, cubes by the way (WTH) he reluctantly refilled it. Not warm or nice about it at all. 3. Price point: Total ripoff! 3ppl = $170 plus. I have had way better Sushi for a third of the price.  Revolving Sushi in Kennesaw kills this place easily...

What I got in response from that was irresponsibility, and being treated as if I'm not even there. I applied a week before that, thinking that I would be able to get an interview from the given manager that had given me the interview on that same day, and all I got was no response from her one bit. I tried texting her, contacting her by calling her, nothing! I was greeted by another manager by the name of Ivy, and she was nice, she couldn't give me a full interview because of work, okay, not a big deal. Turns out I couldn't cover all the bases I wanted for the job, and not only that, they wanted to make me come back the following day, and said that they'll be able to give me a proper interview the next day.I said okay. Ivy isn't there, the person who I was originally supposed to have the interview with, Grace, was there either. Not even Amy is there, so I go \\"Well who am I supposed to talk to in getting an interview.\\", I try talking to the employers, even they're clueless on what to do. They told me to come back the following day on a Friday, I told myself \\"Ah, no no no no no no no, Its either they're here at that moment or I can look somewhere else for a job.\\" so I decided not to go the next day. The level of not telling me ANYTHING that Grace was at vacation for whatever reason it maybe, because I wasn't even told why she was at vacation was so irresponsible, the fact that non of the managers could give me a proper interview, let alone were they even there at the said McDonald's to begin with, was so paramount, that even to this day, I haven't went back to the same McDonald's! I haven't even eaten McDonald's in such a long time, and now because of what happened a week ago, I'm not even sure if I want to be employed by that specific McDonald's because of how much Irresponsibility I get from those same Managers, Grace, Ivy, and Amy alike. I'm sorry about Ivy, and Amy, but Grace left me hanging, and didn't tell me anything about her vacation, nor did she even try to even contact me back about getting another interview at a future date, because my god, was that just bad, overall bad! The employees there were nice, but from what I've been told from Ivy, they're practically the opposite. TL;DR: Don't work at this specific McDonald's unless you want to get let down by the managers at this McDonald's. If you want to eat here, that's not a problem, but not many people from what I've physically seen go here, I hear the one at Fairbanks is a lot better than the ones I've heard about.Sincerely,\\nKevin Joshua Perez"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Powell's Books is like heaven for book-lovers.Great place to sit down and get immersed in a fantastic book.

The ambiance was incredibly lively even at 10PM, and the restaurant is super spacious and modern, with dim  lighting and high ceilings perfect for a dinner date. Even the walls were constructed with oyster shells, which I found very interesting.Our server was very knowledgeable in helping us select various oysters to sample - they were very fresh, large, and extremely satisfying. Some had more of a hint of sweetness, while others were more salty, so our server definitely chose an excellent variety on the oyster spectrum. We ordered the clam chowder, which was delicious to share, mashed potatoes (not worth), the lobster roe noodles, and the grilled prime skirt steak, which was a hearty meal. The lobster roe noodles were phenomenal - the presentation and flavor was amazing. The lobster was fresh and the pieces of braised short rib were so tender, complemented with Brussels sprouts and mushrooms. The cheese in the pasta also richened the flavor overall - 10/10 recommend - the pasta is worth the hype! Bf says the steak was a little too salty, but good overall! While the server was professional and attentive to begin with, he encountered a problem with another customer at a different table, and he spent over 20 minutes conflict managing the issue at hand and completely neglected our table. We were long done with our food and waited 20+ minutes to get the bill, which was an unpleasant experience. He didn't even realize we were finished, and it took so long to flag down a different waiter, so I just wished the service was more efficient and professional, considering that Island Creek Oyster Bar is an upscale restaurant in Boston. Overall the food was really incredible, but the service could be better improved."},{"name":"kreyol kafe & Bakery","address":"12014 E Colonial Dr, Ste 120","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I like the food here, it is better than OK. So, to get a 4 star rating out of me, you really have to impress me. If you are a business based on \\"let's make some money\\", you will not get my attention. I like restaurants that are passionate about their food, with people that have eaten some good food, even places where grandma and auntie are helping in the kitchen. If you can't fulfill any of those requirements, you probably just will be OK, at least in my book.Now, kreyol kafe & Bakery is a pretty good place, but it just needs that extra oomph to be a good restaurant. On my visit here, I ordered the gryot (fried pork chunks) with red beans and rice, and some plantains. The meal was pretty good, I specially liked the amount of fat on the pork, and the rice was well cooked. Only problem, it just didn't gel. The pork was a bit overcooked, and the rice didn't have enough flavor. The plantains were also meh, and the pikliz was not spicy hot enough. It was a washed down experience.Yet, looking on the bright side, they keep Haitian food on the map, and this is great! Plus, they also sell baked good.Again, I have had great Haitian food, and this is good, but not 4 star good (although I wish it was).Have you had any?"},{"name":"Sweet-Stack Creamery","address":"25 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Kevin, Pi, Kenny were not only super helpful, informative and patient with us as we navigated our way through their delectable ice creams- they were SUPER nice and friendly!

A vegetarian friend and I had a longggg list of things to do, so we needed something to revitalize us and keep us recharged for a full day of activities. Solution: Life Alive.I've been craving these types of bowls for awhile because they're packed with fresh ingredients and bursting with flavor. I'm not at all a vegetarian, but I dig variety and flavor more than anything when I choose what to eat. The place is on a corner of Mass Ave, so you'll have lots of places to pass by when you walk there. There's even a field across the street for people to enjoy their food while soaking in some sun.The place has a wonderful mission and is a gem in giving back to its community. The place is a hub for the community, so you'll be buzzing about what to get while in line. Opted for the famous Goddess Bowl and only got it in a demi size since I wasn't extremely hungry just then. Excellent choice and the sauce is the signature of bowls here. I only wish I could have them make me lunch to-go everyday.It left such an impression on my friend, he wanted to get a picture with the owner and it looked as if he was going to cry...he was just so moved.

They have a variety of Japanese and Thai food choices so props for options for the pickier eater. They randomly have Viet iced coffee here, too (don't get it). Came here for a quick work lunch and within 10 minutes regretted it. We were both in a rush - my colleague had to catch a flight (we gave ourselves a reasonable amount of time!). Service during a non busy time wasn't good. Nice doesn't cut it when you walk in and have to wait a long time when it's not busy! There was only one table occupied by 6 people and every other table was empty - it took us 5 minutes to be seated and another 7 minutes or so before we could put drink orders in. Food took awhile to come out, too. If you walk in, maybe you should just seat yourself and anticipate that it's not gonna be a quick lunch.I will say their drunken noodle had a good flavor but didn't taste like drunken noodle. It was closer to a pad see ew flavor! No heat to the dish. Lunch portion was a decent size and around $10.Viet iced coffee is an atrocity - it's basically water with a splash of crappy coffee. For $3! Seriously? No place should serve something like this ever."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I like the dish that I had, but it is expensive for me.

It was actually super comfortable for me, I loved being able to stretch out and lean back. The food was delicious! We tried the Teriyaki Salmon, the edamame, the Agadashi Tofu, the Spider Roll, the Unagi nigiri, and the miso soup and rice. Everything was absolutely scrumptious. Couldn't get enough of it (until we were super full, of course, which didn't take long). I also had the Flying Dutchman cocktail, which was perfect for me because I love sweet and bubbly cocktails. If you like your cocktails to taste like soda pop, this one is for you! Throughout the meal our service was fast and friendly and helpful. Our waiter even suggested a different salmon teriyaki dish than the one we originally ordered, because it came with rice and miso soup and was the same price.

We ordered a feast since we were visiting Portland for the weekend. Of the dishes we ordered, Khao Man Som Tam (green papaya salad) + coconut rice, Khao Soi (curry noodle soup), and Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar meat) stood out. The dishes are all very flavorful, but strangely, the sauces taste slightly different. I like the idea of rice with the salad. They give you the rice separately so you have a choice not to mix the two. As a lot of other reviewers have already said, Pok Pok has delicious sticky rice, and it goes well with pretty much any dish. We had the sticky rice with the boar collar meat. That dish is original, and comes in this delicious lime/garlic/chili sauce. Also, the wait was not very long, but I can see how it may become a problem during busy hours.

The chicken katsu and pork belly baos were close runner ups.There are so many interesting items on this menu...sushi pizza, sushi burgers, sushi fries, etc. I went with the chicken tempura sushi burrito and got the wrapper fried in tempura since our waitress suggested that. It was so amazing that I could describe it to you and it wouldn't do it justice. The sushi pizza was so unexpected but in the best way possible. The crust is like a sushi roll...like what!?!??

The entire restaurant, inside and out is this vibrant aqua color and the walls are decorated with art depicting pigs and wilderness scenes. The bathroom was painted a vibrant tangerine color. Such a fun environment! There is a small outdoor patio but it was a hot day so we requested to sit inside.I ordered the mac & cheese with a side Caesar salad and a cup of potato salad. Yum yum yum. Everything was delicious, I especially loved the potato salad. I took about half of the mac & cheese home and it kept well! Unfortunately, my coworker is allergic to tree nuts so there weren't a lot of options for her since many of their plates included cheeses or other ingredients made from nuts. She informed the waiter of this and he was so accommodating. He was honest with her, telling her that the small kitchen was full of nuts and that he couldn't guarantee that there wouldn't be any cross contamination. Luckily, her allergy is not that severe. She ordered a caesar salad and he suggested a scoop of tuna salad to make it more filling. Despite this hick up she really enjoyed her meal, but we probably won't be going back for a lunch break since she was so restricted.

Everyone working there missed the mark BIG TIME!This story is so long with all the mishaps I'll try to keep it short. My wine glass came half filled; our waitstaff gal never came back to take our food order so I had to get up and find/speak to Isabelle to tell her the couple that arrived after us got their order in before us; we never received the lemon we requested with our water until I told Isabelle yet again; calamari was delivered to our table that we never ordered; my husband ate a few bites of a Nonna's meatball after telling me the \\"veggie\\" meatball isn't that good and that's when I noticed IT WAS MEAT ; I had my hands up in the air waiving to get someone's attention and all the wait staff were just clueless neglecting me. And, of course, the worst part is my husband ate meat after 23 years of being a vegetarian!!!My husband was tempted to leave but he knew I was enjoying my meal since there were no screw ups on mine and we had already waited so long and were so hungry. Therefore, he agreed to accept a correct and newly made meal from Isabelle. Even so, the entire \\"birthday eve\\" dinner experience for my husband was ruined at this point. His meal was comped, although, in my opinion, our drinks should have been comped too or at least offered a free dessert.Last but not least, I was dying to try the chocolate mousse cake, but I couldn't get myself to spend another dime and open myself up for another possible disappointment. TIP: Isabelle you are an extremely nice and charismatic woman. I would suggest giving constructive feedback to your staff somewhere where customers cannot see. I would also suggest you lighten up on the up selling of your menu. Explain the menu and then let folks order without being obtrusive. We could hear that same spiel at every table.

She sounds extremely lazy & annoyed. Anyway, I call in for a delivery and when I realized it's been over an hour (I was told 20 min but I like to give them time) and also saw a missed call about 3 min before I called back to see what was up and she tells me the driver already came by but never rang the bell. So I asked why not? And the girl literally responds saying \\"we don't ring bells we call.\\" OKAY..so why didn't you let me know that before hand? Side note: I deliver for restaurants all around Boston & deal with the most COMPLICATED buildings with NO parking and I figure it out. I sometimes have to go up MANY flights of stairs, alleyways, cross busy streets while my cars illegally parked  just to get to the customer but I don't just pull up, call once & leave!!  Not to mention I live in a single family home right around the corner from Wings over Somerville and there's ONE doorbell! It was broad daylight and couldn't have been any more simple!!!! I can't stress that enough!! My house number is RIGHT THERE WITH A DOORBELL IN YOUR FACE!!! It's clear as day!! As the driver.. why would you want to waste time going back knowing you'll probably have to come right back here again (which he did.) Any other delivery I've ever had in Life  call me as they're walking to my front door then ring the bell. My house number and doorbell are  clearly there! So I go back and look at my front camera footage and literally watched him pull up for maybe 1.5 min and drive off. Never left the car never made any sort of attempt to ring the bell even once! How do you just pull up and decide \\"I'm not getting out of my car so I'm going back\\" WHAT?! I've never ever ever had a delivery driver do that EVER!!!!!! Don't get me wrong though.. he was a very nice guy & the wings are great (use to be better) but they're WAAY too over priced (seriously)! I rather just get S&S wings in Cambridge.

I live within walking distance from this location, so the only reason I gave it 1 star is because of convenience; I would give it zero if I could. I've been here numerous times over the course of 4 months and each time has been utterly terrible. Where to begin...I'll start with the staff. The customer service at this location is horrendous. The staff doesn't make eye contact with you while you order and when your order is ready to be picked up, they don't smile or attempt to be friendly with you. The food, while decent, is hardly accurate to the way the customer orders it. Every single time I've ordered food here, there was a problem with the order. If my order isn't mixed up with another order or the staff forgot my coffee or single donut, it's normally the staff telling me they are out of something after I've already placed the order. Cross-contamination is also a problem here. If I order a plain bagel with cream cheese, I want a plain bagel with cream cheese, not a plain bagel with garlic or poppy seeds mixed in the cream cheese. I understand if cross-contamination occurs in the toaster, but every time I've had this issue it was because a separate knife was not used to spread the plain cream cheese. Overall, this location has great potential, especially given its proximity to Disney and the Orlando Premium Outlets. But the staff needs to be retrained on customer service skills. Mind you, these issues did not occur on one, two, or even three visits; they occur consistently, to some degree, every single time I'm there, without fail."},{"name":"Goomba's Pizzeria","address":"2395 US-27","city":"Clermont","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped in for a dinner date with my bride, used the 15% off coupon from a facebook group without any problem.

Our drinks were legitimately good.These are the only good things I can say about our experience.We walked in and it was reasonably busy.  Security asked my spouse for ID, then told her she needed to order then find a seat and vanished.  We stood at the bar for about 15 minutes.  One person came over and asked if we had been helped.  We said no.  They said ok, and walked away.  We eventually ordered, but the lady just took the order and walked away.  We tried to sit down but were told that the table we sat at was reserved for someone else.  Which is fantastic since we were told to find a table.  There was just zero traffic control or service and nothing that we had was worth any of the bizarre service.I couldn't help but laugh at the overwhelming hipster vibe.  It's entirely possible that we are just not the customers they want.  Which is fine.  Because we will never be back.  But we went across the river to 3 other places... also super hipster... and adults worked there, acted like adults, and accepted our money with pleasure.  In a city with so many solid places to go, I'm fascinated that Hey Love is so popular.  In total, it is a kitschy too loud hotel bar with good drinks and decent decor.

They said it was a must have, it's delicious, etc.  But I'm gonna be real honest, I am so sad because I had expected HIGH expectations for this restaurant only to come to figure that it was just... not that great.The ambiance here is pretty tight in space.  Downstairs, the main restaurant level is a little more roomier.  The decor is cute.  It's like eating outside downtown under twinkly lights.  Upstairs is where the kitchen was.  It's more inside of a house.  There's a few tables that are more intimate, and there's a side for a bigger group.Customer Service was great.  I have no complaints.  The waitress was really sweet, though, I wish water was refilled with the fact that I put my water out to the edge as a courtesy for them to refill... I thought people still did that... Food... This is the reason why I give it a 1 star...1.  Kaopoon:  I am such a huge fan of kaopoon.  I've dated a Laotian guy and as soon as I started learning about their food culture, I fell in love.  Kaopoon is a chicken curry coconut soup that has a kick of spice.  The best part of this dish is the soup.  So when this bowl of Kaopoon was served to me, there wasn't enough soup in there.  With the vermicelli noodles that were already there, it absorbed all the soup, and I was left with ... just noodles and chicken.  The flavor was there, but the ratio of soup to noodle was no bueno...2.  Laab Kai:  Laap Kai is basically Laap Gai, or minced chicken served with salad.  My disappointment with this dish is that the Gai, or chicken, was cut up into thicker pieces and was just powdered with laab powder and topped with lime juice.  It had to be the worst dish that was brought out to me.3.  Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings:  Their main specialty is Vietnamese chicken wings?  You can't be serious right?  First of all... this isn't even a Thai dish, so why is it their most popular?  Second of all, this was fish sauce over kill.  And let me just put it this way, Vietnamese people make these wings all the time.  I am very WELL familiar with how it's suppose to taste.  As soon as I took my first bite, I wanted to spit it back out.  Pok Pok is definitely over hyped.  I understand Laos cuisine and Thai cuisine is slightly different, and I've ate so much that I'm pretty sure I distinguish the slightly differences.  But this, was a no no.  I felt like it's a slap in the face to all other Thai/Lao restaurants out there.  To each their own, but not for me.  I'm gonna have to pass - and as far as I know, I wouldn't recommended it either sadly to say."},{"name":"Avalon Pockets","address":"3564 Tanja King Blvd, Ste 2","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Delicious and fresh food!

We met up at Taco Mac and made our way down to GA Chapter Room after everyone arrived.  It was easy to find - just take a left out of Taco Mac and go down the walkway on the side of the building until you get to the bottom of the hill.  Follow the red lights past the dumpster and there is a sign on the door, push the buzzer (the left one!) and wait.This restaurant has more of a gentleman's club feeling than a speakeasy, but the club chairs were comfortable, it was significantly quieter than the restaurant upstairs, and there were curtains that could be drawn to separate your party from the adjoining table.Aside from feeling like a club in decor, it also felt like an exclusive club in terms of service.  Our waitress (name unknown - she did not give it, even after we inquired) was inattentive and distracted the whole time our group was there.  She seemed more interested in chatting with the regulars than taking our order.  It took three times for our table to get everyone's drink order placed - she came back several times because the bar was out of the beer my friends ordered and she had to go back to ask for suggestions on something similar.  When our drinks finally came, the order was correct - but we were all drinking beer or wine, so there wasn't much room for error.Ordering food wasn't much better - it took two times for our order to be taken and the food didn't come out at the same time.  We ordered the charcuterie plate, the truffle fries, and the Italian flatbread.  Once all of our food arrived, it was good, but nothing stood out - it was upscale bar food that can be ordered at numerous other restaurants.Overall, I and my friends were displeased with the service experience we had at GA Chapter Room.  The food was decent enough, but not good enough to make me want to go back.  If you are in the Sandy Springs area, I would recommend trying it once just to say you've been, but I wouldn't go out of my way.

In general the service was terrible, when asked for an additional drink menu or the WiFi password I was told there were menus on the tables (there weren't) and she just said she didn't know the password. Not sure if they were painfully hungover but it wasn't busy and they were zero help. I worked as a waitress in the service industry for many years and it's easier to be nice than to act condescending to paying customers. Unfortunately gratuity was included in our final bill.

And this time we wanted to try something different than before (last time we tried the boar meat which was good, but we wanted to mix it up). We also ordered an order of the Neua naam tok $15.75.The chicken wings as always were on point. The perfect balance of fish sauce with caramelized sugar, garlic, and spices was magically addicting. It was crisp, but still saucy on the outside. The meat inside was moist and had a punch of flavor that is very unique to this place. So good, seriously, you MUST GET THIS!The neua naam tok \\"flank steak salad\\" was just as good packing a large punch of flavors that marry so well together. You have to get a side of jasmine rice to soak up all the juices. The meat is cooked perfectly, and all the slices of herbs and lemongrass add so many great textures and flavors it's sad when you take the last bite because it leaves you wanting more. I really enjoyed this dish as well and will probably get it again next time.The durian custard was the most disappointing.

We got seated next to a party with a child, which always freaks me out because I feel like I can't say any bad words or anything, but we managed to stay on good behavior until the kid was gone.  It would have probably been more fun if more people had been there, but it started to fill up while we were finishing up.  Anyway, the happy hour here is pretty comprehensive; from 3 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., all appetizers are half-price and all their patio cocktails (minus the moonshine jug, of which I'm intrigued yet terrified) are only $4.  The hard lemonade drink (sort of like a vodka mojito) is really good, as is the moonlit cosmo martini.  And the margarita.  And the long island iced tea-style drink.  (For the record, I didn't drink all these myself, though I probably would have enjoyed it.  Thoroughly.)  And the food was pretty good comfort food; we shared the spinach/artichoke fondue and the roasted garlic bulbs.  The boys shared an order of calamari which I normally find really rubbery and therefore unappealing, but this stuff was probably the least rubbery calamari I've tasted.  It was actually reasonably good.  I also had the potato corn chowder, which was kind of spicy and very tasty.  I really want to go back for the Sunday brunch.

What was once an up-scale fresh seafood establishment is no longer. Our latest visit was the absolute end to our visits. We came during the lunch buffet recently and were absolutely shocked at how drastic their establishment had changed for the worse. When we were walking to the entrance, there was an un-refrigerated truck out front bringing in boxes of food. I can only hope the food being brought in was not fish or meat.The vast majority of the selections were unavailable. The sushi was disgustingly lukewarm and tasted clearly not fresh by any means. I absolutely love sushi, sashimi, etc. trust me when I say that this was not fresh. We addressed the missing selections in hopes to have a salad of some sort to no avail. Sure, they said they would restock it, but never did.As time went by, we spoke with the supervisor/manager. Who bowed a few times and explained to me they have new staff and our still learning. \\n*Which is irrelevant! I just want some food!All of the employees literally couldn't look more miserable... Except for our waitress Mohoganay,  who was very friendly.Last but not least and to cap off our miserable dining experience, there was an actual roach like bug scattering around on our table! Never in my life have I actually had this occur to me, let alone from a so-called high-end buffet. When I bought it to our waitresses attention, she appeared shocked when she seen it. She then told the manager/supervisor who came with a towel and quickly did whatever she did with it. She (the supervisor/manager) did nothing about the situation. Literally, I spoke and she didn't! She did nothing! Let alone a comp. It was actually strange. How do you receive a complaint, and then personally see a bug, then a complaint, and say nothing at all!? It's not like she didn't understand me, as she had previously made various excuses and justifications as to why there was nothing to eat but soup and old food scraps.I am a person who generally eats plenty, especially at a buffet style restaurant. I left hungry. *Also, the 'Owner Replies' from other displeased reviewers comments are nonsense. The servers are NOT trained well to handle situations such as mine, as they did nothing to rectify our situation(s) when brought to their attention.I couldn't be more shocked and displeased at this simply disgusting experience.

The potatoes were built up too highly in other reviews because to me they were just ordinary and the shells with cheese might as well have come straight out of a box.Based on food alone, I would rate Nico's three stars. Two other factors contributed to a lower rating, however. First, one of the reviews here mentioned a bug was found in a hamburger. Besides not being able to get the image out of my head as I ate, I was more disturbed at the proprietor's lack of concern and silence in response. Second they had two bottles of novelty hot sauces in their display case, both hostile to Democrats. There were no bottles representing the opposing view.

It'll probably be a fun experience for people unfamiliar with Thai / generally Asian food. Food itself was very salty, but saved by the rice. I won't go into detail about the dishes; seems like a lot of the existing 3 star and below reviews talk about the same dryness and saltiness.

But because of the lack of organization and the way they have their ordering/line set up, plus the lackluster customer service I had to downgrade to 4 stars.We are at 4 stars and here comes the \\"meat\\" of the review. They offer many Cuban staples but they were out of the pastelitos de guayaba (guava pastry), etc. by 12 noon? The coffee was o.k. made the typical Cuban way no biggie.The pastelitos de carne (meat hand pie) were terrific and surprisingly not typical. The meat filling was well seasoned, even the crust was seasoned which isn't what Cubans typically do and that made them delectable. The flavors reminded me of Puerto Rican cooking which is also very delicious. At $3 (tax included) a pop they were reasonably priced due to being airport food. I did purchase several to take home and many were not as full of meat as the few I had eaten.I also purchased 5 Cuban sandwiches to go. I ate one as I waited for the other flight and it was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!How in the heck can they ruin a CS? No se, pero lo hicieron.The bread might of been their version of C bread but it was not good nor typical, the pork would have been excellent beside congris but it was too seasoned for the sandwich and completely overwhelmed the other flavors so the only thing you tasted was mojo criollo on the pork and nothing else. Their pickles were pure salt, hardly any cheese, mustard and the ham was so salty it defied logic! Each sandwich tasted the same because I took them apart (to my family's chagrin) before they consumed them to check - and ditto the rest. The CS are smallish for $10 and sadly do not taste good.

I *know* mexican food.  I love good mexican food.  You might say that I'm the WRONG guy to write this review (or maybe the right guy - you decide).But let's start with the positive - the restaurant if festive, friendly and clean. The waitstaff is pleasant and efficient. The bar is stocked with the expected liquors, good selection of Tequilia and bad Mexcian beer (this is normal and I know it can't be helped - good luck finding craft beer at a Mexican place!).  Heck, Parking was even easy.  In short, there's nothing not to like about dining here.   Except the food.I ordered the lowest of low-hanging fruit - a taco and an enchilada.  To me, that's the best way to get a sense of a Mex place - if they don't do THESE right, they won't do much of anything else right.  So when my store-bought-hard-shell-ground-beef taco showed up, I knew what was what.  For you non-border-town folks, a taco is NOT a hard-shell (ala Taco Bell) but a soft-yet-fried corn tortilla with seasoned shredded beef.  YES, you can see un-fried tacos and yes, you can see flour - but the whole preformed hard corn-shell thing is just... it's like fast food.  I had some hope for the enchilada, but it too disappointed - dull (as in tasted like it was straight from a 1 gallon can) sauce, flavorless chicken (I had ordered cheese, but these things happen).   I could not finish either the Taco or the Enchilada.  The young lady serving me let me know she was from Los Angels and actually apologized for the food (folks here don't know good Mexican - the love this).  So like I said, this review is UNFAIR. I know what this type of food should taste like. This is not Mexican food. It is gringo food. If that's what you like, then you will enjoy this.  If you want something authentic... well, you will not be pleased.But I do want to repeat - it's a fun place - nice folks, TV's to watch the game, full bar. I might go back just to snack on chips and have a few beers watching a game.

I've been eagerly been awaiting its' arrival ever since first reading about it. Decor is lively, bright, and open. Chairs and booths are bit uncomfortable though but compliment the tables well. An open kitchen is very desirable to customers. Cocktails were delicious. I was a bit hesitant in ordering it since some of the ingredients sounded very wild to me.Cucumber was delectable, dainty but packs so much punch. The plating bowl reminded my partner and I of a pet feeding dish. Heirloom tomato was way too sour for me, very bitter. Not my favorite. Plating was in a gorgeous glass bowl though. Tomato crudo was light, refreshing, ricotta was perfect accompaniment. Finishing salt was perfect and not too much. Lemon butter was a very subtle favor of lemon and super creamy\\nThis Bread and butter aren't the perfect pairing in my opinion. The protein sides took a bit long to deliver. Firing times still haven't been figured out I think. Porky pork was delicious but very spicy almost overwhelming. Very tender Hanger steak was definitely if not overly charred. The Gouda fondue and carmelized onions were addicting. The steak was a bit tasteless. Can't taste the horseradish at all, very salty. The cook on the meat was very under not medium rare like we ordered more like rare. Components of dish don't go together at all. Chirashi bowl is served cold. Strange. Kind of muddled. Desserts were goodPlateware was intermingled for every dish. No two items are played on the same kind of plate from looking around the restaurant. The bathrooms are a hoot! Definitely check them out if you get the chance! I won't spoil the surprise by posting photos. Overall, I feel like I left feeling a bit hungry still.

So this could have made it to the cons list, but the customer service here is pretty great.

We mentioned this to the server who asked the cook who made us another 5 pc roll pro  bono. (So..technically we got 2 free pieces of sushi lol, but at least they made the situation right) Cons1. The pricing is, in my opinion, outrageous for what you get. \\nThree of us ate for $70 for what seemed like a less-than-$40 experience2. The boba slushes....you know, I was psyched to see this place on Instagram served boba slushes! Cuz it's about dang time we have boba in Lake County...too bad I'll never order this boba again. At $7 a pop, the taro slush I drank was unflavorfull, unsweetened, and the boba was hard and undercooked. I have to say, these prices are unsustainable. It's simple economics--supply and demand.One boba slush probably costs 50 cents to make. So it makes more sense, to me, to price it at something reasonable like $4 dollars and sell 50 a day (and have repeat customers) rather than the outrageous $7 and sell maybe 15 a day. Make sense? If it was $4-$5 (and tasted better) I would be over here a few times a WEEK. But at $7 a pop I'll never be back again. 3. The dish I ordered, the vegetarian Hibachi bowl, costs $2 to add tofu....with the other Hibachi bowls that come with meat, it's already included in the hefty $10 price tag for what you get. It's weird to me that the vegetarian bowl has an up-charge for it's protein. All in all.

Read on for more details.Ah, so here is True Food Kitchen, a prime example of those bougie restaurants that serve ethically-sourced and organic foods, but that perpetuate this insane and wrong idea that healthier/more ethical foods must be bland and skimp on all seasoning.I'll be frank, the service was okay (not extraordinary or anything, just not bad). Other than that, I noticed that there was no diversity amongst the clientele, and that the food was overwhelmingly sub-par. In particular, my friend and I ordered: edamame dumplings as an app, and the pad thai and steak tacos as our entrees. Aside from having no taste, the food actually came out cold too, which was a huge disappointment (imagine a cold steak taco).We were already disappointed with the edamame dumplings, which were more bland than we expected, but we understand that edamame is not a super taste-charged food. So we gave the entrees a chance, but the pad thai is not really pad thai at all and didn't taste like pad thai / didn't have much taste at all (I should've known not to get Thai food at a non-Thai restaurant, and so I won't say too much about this). But the steak tacos were just a bummer, because the steak was just bland, and what seasoning we could taste was not good (it had a bit of a weird, sour taste).Over all, not impressed. Plus, the food was WAY overcharged (I had wanted a poke bowl, but it was $22, which is just preposterous considering there are SO many poke places around town where the price is half that much and the taste is probably not as bland). Our super lackluster and disappointing meal (1 app + 2 entrees) came out to be $50+ before tip.

I just knew I needed to try it for myself!This place is a very short 30-second walk from the Kenmore train station. My friend and I arrived right when it opened at 5pm and were seated right away. We immediately noticed the mountain of oysters chiling in a bath of ice! They looked delicious! Sadly, my friend and I aren't fans of oysters. Once seated, we were given sourdough bread and honey butter. OMG! That honey butter is LIFE CHANGING!!! It was sooo good! It was very sweet and I have a huge sweet tooth so I thoroughly enjoyed it.Before even looking at the menu, which is quite confusing and not very descriptive at all! I knew I wanted that delicious clam chowder. It was described as having chunks of clams, potato, house-cured bacon, and topped off with mini buttermilk biscuits! I could not wait to try it! At $11 for a bowl, this was pretty steep so my expectations were pretty high. Once the food arrived I was a bit disappointed...First off, when I think of clam chowder, I think of thick and heavy. This was much more soupy than expected. I also thought the chunky-ness of the soup would be chunkier(?). I hope that makes sense! The highlight of this dish was definitely those buttermilk biscuits! They floated nicely on top of the soup and were sooo flavorful! They were very buttery and flaky and the soup came with 3! I savored each one of them! My friend got the fried fish sandwich with fries. Her fish portion was very generous and the fish itself was nice and golden brown on the outside and moist on the inside. Although I enjoyed the fish, the bread was soggy from having too much sauce and the sauce was very overwhelming. It was a spicy tartar sauce it was too much spice! Overall, I can honestly say I found better clam chowder at other places in Boston at a much cheaper price. I do understand this is an OYSTER bar and we were literally the only ones not eating oysters. Maybe we came here for the wrong thing? If you're not an oyster fan, I wouldn't recommend coming here."},{"name":"Brassica","address":"2212 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"4.5","text":"Love! Love! Love! So many flavors!!

Some of us remembered the place very differently - with excellent food and service. The ambience is still amazing - although we had to ask to be seated away from our original table that was basically in the entrance. That request was taken care of immediately and professionally. Cocktails were also good.The food was insufficient for a restaurant in this price category. Medium rare steaks came out as medium well, sides were flavorless (the cauliflower was by far the worst of the sides. A flavorless blob without color and texture), service was underwhelming. Friendly, but lacking professional approach to the food. So this seems to be a problem not of the waiter, but the way Mitchell's recruits and trains. At home, we discovered that we were charged for the \\"free\\" dessert for the birthday person after all. This place might be a good option for a nice drink at the bar.

Pok Pok, my #1 Asian dining choice in Portland, proved to be successful in their implementation of taking the highlights of key traditional dishes and transforming them into taste bud popping miracles.  While they claim no Asian Fusion, their adaptations of Viet, Chinese and other non-Thai dishes translate into what I call Fusion.  You have to remember that their lunch menu, served from 11:30am to 2:30pm is much different from their dinner menu.  From 2:30 to 5:00pm, it is an abbreviated menu that are mainly composed of appetizer dishes.  I have visited during all three time frames.Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - As others may have mentioned, the sticky, fish sauce wings are addicting like candy.  Eaten by themselves, could prove to be salty but then is balanced and neutralized if you pair it up with a side of seemingly perfect sticky rice.  Sii Khrong Muu Yang - Carlton Farms Baby Back Ribs with two types of sauce.  Ever had Chinese Spareribs or Cha Siu from a roast duck/pork place?  Yup, it is cooked and made exactly the same.  I don't see any big differences from Chinese Spareribs except the sauces.  Good stuff nevertheless.Da Chom's Laap Meuang - minced pork salad with cracklings, crispy, crunchy shallots, garlic and herbs.   I am amazed at the variety of flavor profiles, savory crunch with herbs and aromas with very little to no gaminess expected from pork offal/blood.Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\" - catfish marinated in turmeric, resembles the Vietnamese Cha Ca Thang Long I know and love.  This fish is topped on vermicelli along with dill, cilantro, peanuts and dill with a fermented anchovy sauce (mam nem).  To me, it tastes exactly like the original but without the traditional wrap and dip method that of the Thang Long version.  All in all, Pok Pok is my choice to include on any itinerary for trips down to Portland.  Reasonable prices and dynamic flavors set it apart from your everyday Asian restaurant.

Took a while for our food to come out.  And, there is no place to sit.  Great.  Eh, from that short experience, the service really wasn't impressive.  The hostesses were quite rude.

Beer is not just consumed in my house, it is studied.  Beer is stored at proper temperature, aroma and  appearance are observed and notes are taken.  And Belgians are a favorite of his.  I, on the other hand, still think beer tastes like bum pee.  After a decade of tasting every beer he's drunk I can pick up subtle tasting notes but I still don't want to drink vagrant urine. The name Buster's Bistro sounds like a place where I can buy a hot dog and cheese fries with tickets I won playing skee-ball.    I've never really been a bar kinda girl.  I don't get paying high prices to hang out in a dark dirty place and drink watered down alcohol with strangers.  But Buster's is nice.  The owners clearly put money into the place.  Everything is covered in wood, even the ductwork in the ceiling.   I could hang out here.   The menu is Belgians and Belgian styles.  There are a few wines on the menu.  The beer menu lists brand, style, description and alcohol %.  Talk to the bartender, he'll steer you in the right direction.   Buster's is the kind of place where they want you to feel like to you can hang out and enjoy yourself.  Just keep in mind if you're waiting for them to come back and check on you, you could be waiting a while. I also ordered a tailor made board.  Two cheeses is a lot for one person.  The 5 year gouda was amazing, but if you are a meat eater I would recommend a salty meat to go along with it  I'd really like to see them use social media to keep their fans up to date on what's going on.   The website says \\"18 delicious taps and an assortment of around  50 bottles\\" but no mention of what they are.  The beer menu changes frequently.  Someone is taking the time to type up that beer menu, throw that up on facebook!  Pick a beer, take a picture, put it on facbook with the description from the menu.

There were thumb tacks randomly scattered throughout the venue that could have easily caused a medical emergency.2. The sound system was horrible and the sound guy was nowhere near as knowledgeable as he should have been. They allowed the feed  back to interfere with the artists sets and made no attempt to correct the problems. 3. The drinks were over priced and served in tiny plastic cups that would better serve shots. The price wouldn't be so bad if the drinks weren't served in mini cups.4.Back to the sound. For some reason they only played music out of one speaker and justified their short comings by saying \\" Hey, it's the best we can do without a real sound guy and busted equipment.\\" I felt bad for the performers because all of them were talented but the venue definitely affected the vibe of the room with the horrible equipment.

When you go to Paris you go to the Eiffel Tower. When you go to Seattle you go to the Space Needle. And when you go to Portland you go to Powell's Books. Why? Because it's iconic. Because it's legendary. Because it's all things that make the city unique and vibrant. And, in the case of Powell's, because it's pretty much the most awesome bookstore ever.With multiple levels of all things hardcover and paperback, a trip through Powell's always gives me hope that e-readers (as convenient as they are) will never truly take over the world. Because: books. The smell. The feel. The glossy color photos. Things that just can't be replaced by electronics. I love to start on the top floor, near the tempting Rare Book Room where entry is not easily gained. On this level are the creative books - photography, sewing, felting, fashion, how-to-build-a-shelf-out-of-seashells - it's all here. I could literally spend hours, if not days, perusing the shelves on this floor. But then I remember all the booky goodness on the lower levels, so I make a selection or two and start winding my way back down to the first floor and the most tempting section of all: cookbooks.The cool thing about Powell's is they have both new and used books - and they're mixed in together so if you want a bright, shiny new copy it's there. But if you're ok with a used version of the same book, well, they've likely got that too. And don't get me started on their endcaps, which most likely were designed by someone with a high level degree in marketing and \\"tempting people into buying things they didn't know they needed.\\"  They've also got an impressive selection of local souvenirs and just plain cool stuff.

I love reading and finding places like this that have sooo many books and still provide a great experience make me very happy. They have both used and new books. One of my favorite things was the little recommendations that were scattered throughout. With so many books it can be easy to get overwhelmed but the little cards all around give good ideas and ratings for some of the books. It was particularly helpful in the kids section because the reviews were done by actual kids. They're hand written and even have the child's age. It makes looking for gifts a lot easier.

The staff told us to wait for about 20 minutes because they only had certain seats for party of 3. The wait was shorter than we expected.Based on staff's recommendation and Yelpers' tips, we ordered the famous chicken wings, claypot shrimp vermicelli, spicy beef salad and five-spiced duck leg stew. Among everything we ordered, we love the dug leg the most because the flavor was well-balanced. The duck leg was super soft and you could easily pull the meat off the bone. Our least favorite dish was the beef salad. It was way too salty. I personally did not think it was spicy but because of its saltiness, we could barely finish the dish. The chicken wings were alright. I personally like the wings from SO (in SF). I think Pok Pok's chicken wings were too sweet for our taste. The claypot shrimp vermicelli was alright. Nothing fancy.Overall, I think Pok Pok was a decent restaurant. I would not wait in line for more than 1 hour for their food tho."},{"name":"Pon Thai Bistro","address":"213 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"We did take out from this restaurant last night and although our portions were pretty large, both my Green curry pork, and my hubby's Pad Thai chicken were super bland!!! Absolutely no spice for medium! However, the duck rolls were really tasty.  We then called the restaurant to complain about the lack of heat, and must say they couldn't be more accommodating! They apologized, and said they would give us a credit for our next meals. Seems fair. Will try again, and report back.  Hubby explained that the restaurant was busy for a Thursday night at 8, and it looked nice for dining in. Let's hope  the second time is a charm.\\nUpdate: last night, I phoned the restaurant and spoke with the manager Yai, to see if we could get our complementary entrees, after the disappointing dishes the prior week. I am happy to report that Yai was extremely gracious, not hesitating to make good on his promise to please us, so we ordered the Chicken Green Curry medium spicy, along with the Chicken Pineapple Fried Rice medium hot, and the Shrimp Spring Rolls and Shumai appetizers. All I can say is WOW!  What a difference from last time!!! The food was excellent; both great quality and spice level. Even the Spring Rolls and Shumai were really flavorful!!!!! When my hubby went to pick up our order, he explained to me that the owner was also very nice and accommodating. My hubby made clear that our entrees had zero spice the previous week, and she could not have been more understanding about it. We will definitely be back, based upon their customer service and awesome food. Thanks to Pon Thai Bistro for making things right!"},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We absolutely enjoyed our family vacation here (in the midst of our wedding anniversary-lol).

The breakfast is pretty good but nothing gourmet.  There is no lox for your bagels, no Eggs Benedict with crabmeat (for $20, the Omni hotels provide gourmet breakfast fare such as the aforementioned.  I almost booked a room at the Omni in Orlando, but someone talked me out of it since it is too far from Disney).   I think breakfast at Harvest Bistro is $22 if you have to pay for it separately, kids eat free.  We went during spring break so there was a long wait to be seated, about 30 minutes during the weekend.  They do have a good system with the beepers and provided juice and coffee while you waited.  Long wait for the omelets too.  The breakfast consisted of scramble eggs, bacon, muffins, pancakes, fruit, etc.  I do have to say that the homemade granola is pretty fantastic.   The grits are buttery and soothing.   Also, ask the waiter to bring you the triple filtered seltzer water.  The waiters at breakfast were always very friendly and helpful with drinks and advice on making the most of our vacation.We also ate at the dinner buffet for two nights before we knew any better.   I do not recommend the dinner buffet because the food was not fantastic. Nothing to rave about.  The first night, the waiter was very helpful and brought us drinks and coffee.  The second night, the waitress told us there was a one soft drink limit with our meal.  It was a buffet and she was only there to bring us drinks.  She rolled her eyes at us when my husband told her the waiter brought us coffee the night before.   Very unprofessional.  Needless to say that was reflected in her tip.  After this waitress, we decided to seek other places for dinner, so she did us a favor.  We are at La Luce the next three evenings (see my review for La Luce).  Yes, we are creatures of habit."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Everythings there is good, food, service, and nice place."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"6240 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Chick-fil-A at Broad Street it's always busy no matter what time of day you come.

Guess I could have gone back and said something but was really time to leave by the time I figured this out.

All I can say about this restaurant is it's being over-rated due to the following reasons:Firstly, the restaurant didn't take reservations so when we got there, the queues were quite extensive but we decided to give this restaurant a try in spite of the 2 hours wait. Secondly, the foods were too salty. We ordered VIETNAMESE FISH SAUCE CHICKEN WINGS and they were just too salty. I acknowledge the fact that fish sauce is supposed to be salty, however, I have had other Vietnamese fish sauce chicken wings before but they weren't as salty as these. The wings, however, were well seasoned but they just needed to cut down on the saltiness. Four of us couldn't finish one order of chicken wings. I would give this dish a 2 stars.The second dish that we ordered was SPICY BEEF SALAD. We were quite disappointed on its taste too-- it was way too salty hence we couldn't finish it. I would give this dish a 1 star for it being in-consumable.The third dish that we ordered was PAPApapaya salad. This dish was okay comparing to the other dishes. I would give this a 3 stars. The last dish we ordered was Prawn Noddles. The noodles were dried, lack of taste, and again too salty. I would give this dish a 1 star."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My Slappy's experience epitomizes why I don't normally do breakfast or brunch in PDX. Granted, there are a few gems that offer a killer Benedict, or specialty french toast with lemon curd type of dish, but it is very likely you will be waiting somewhere between 20-75 minutes for a table. I am not OK with waiting that long for what is, most of the time a very overpriced, mediocre breakfast. My point is, I can whip up perfectly cooked eggs, bacon and avocado toast in the comfort of my PJ's in my own kitchen for a fraction of the price. OR, pickup a bagel, yogurt or wrap to accompany my coffee and perhaps eat a bigger lunch or dinner.So, Slappy's: Luckily we were able to navigate through the mob loud kids at the entrance and get a seat at the counter. Ordered the \\"Truckstop\\", basic eggs, potatoes, toast, sausage (links) and short stack. Service was great, food arrived hot and promptly. Eggs ordered over medium were cooked on high heat (hard cooked), and thus had the crispy/crusty film making them hard to cut apart and harder to chew. Sausage links and potatoes were very good...in fact the taters were among the best breakfast taters ive ever had. Pancakes were OK, but they were served on a plate that was the same circumference as the cakes themselves, making the buttering/syrup and consuming process a frustrating mess. The plate of food cost me $15 plus a $3 tip. The food probably cost Slappy's about $1.23. The same breakfast could have been purchased at Shari's or Pig-N-Pancake for half that.I get that kids love to make their own pancakes at the griddle tables, but unless your kid is begging you to go here, and if you aren't dining with kids at all, you can do better! It is loud, busy, and full of sneezing children with syrup on their hands.Good:   potatoes, service, sausage links, coffee\\nBad:     loud, wait time, crowds, egg prep, pancake presentation, pricey"},{"name":"Taste of Peru","address":"9521 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 117 A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This was my first experience with Peruvian food, AMD I was encouraged by the presence of Latino locals.

The calamari had a wonderful amount of flavor and the sauce had a nice little kick to it.  It was more then enough for the table of 8.  The shrimp corn dogs are relatively small for the price but they do taste great.  I ordered the rainbow trout dish looking for a nice lighter side dish but was definitely surprised how massive the meal was.  Covered in bacon and cornbread crumbs, you just can't go wrong.  Finally, we were near the end of our meal and we wanted to try something small so we ordered what we thought would be 2 small slices of pie for the table.  Little did we know, they would bring enough pie for 15 people.  The Oreo moose was amazing and the apple pie tasted extremely fresh.

For example, when Jeremy Lin got his championship with the Raptors, instead of saying cool bro what a journey, a lot of Asian Americans were like what an asterisk without taking into account how hard it is to be on an NBA roster. Also, I recently went to a dim sum place in SF that was \\"not authentic\\" and some of my friends commented that the place was \\"overpriced\\" or \\"Americanized\\".  Let me pause here and say, can't we just celebrate and enjoy things for what they are if they are good? Freaking haters yo.  I bookmarked Pok Pok because it is one of the most reviewed places in Portland. The wife and I pulled the plug for over a decade so my wife did not know the chef, Andy Ricker, was Caucasian. When I found out, I kept that part a secret to see how she would react. Guess what? She was surprised in a good way when I told her because the food was delicious. I think if you go into Pok Pok with preconceived biases or try to compare it to your nana's cooking, then you should just stay home because no one can compete with nana. Na-na-na. However, if you want to try food that is fresh, vibrant, and tasty, then book that reservation now. Pok Pok is the Thai onomatopoeia for the sound of wooden pestles hitting mortars to make papaya salads. I found out from a Filipino friend that pok-pok is slang for a prostitute in Tagalog lol. I guess I am a pok-pok for Pok Pok? Moreover, imagine if the \\"o\\" in Pok Pok were an \\"e\\", Pinays would be laughing all day. Although, some people might say Pok Pok smells like P*k P*k because of all the fish sauce ROFL. Fish sauce. I guess you either hate it or love it. I'm Korean so we have some funky smelly foods and a lot of people use fish sauce in kimchi so I don't mind it at all. But if you are not used to it, it's probably a sensory overload. And, Pok Pok's famous wings are marinated with a fish sauce marinade. We loved the wings which were super tasty and legit.  Sidenote: I wondered why the wings were called Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. I was like who the heck is Ike? Turns out Ike is the nickname for Mr. Ich \\"Ike\\" Truong who was Pok Pok's first employee (and still employed) when Pok Pok was just a street cart and the recipe is his family recipe from Vietnam.  Since the restaurant is named Pok Pok, we had to get the papaya salad. It had the right amount of tang and zest and wasn't too spicy which I did not mind at all.  Another tasty dish that we got was the clay pot noodle dish with prawns called kung op wun sen. Very good. The coconut rice was good, but not worth $3.75. Maybe if they threw in some mangos? I would suggest just getting the regular jasmine rice. At the end of the day, I recommend that you Pick Pick Pok Pok if you are visiting Portland or if you just want some really tasty Southeast Asian food that tastes legit. Pok Pok has a dog-friendly patio, which is why it's 5 stars in my book! Hard to find dog-friendly restaurants that taste good and have great service. The struggle is real. * Hey Trailblazers, as of August 5, 2019, Jeremy Lin remains a free agent.

There is a lot and it's all super complicated with lots of words on the menu. So we put our fate in the hands of the leaders of our little group and we ordered a plethora of dishes to share.We had some coconut rice, jasmine rice, and sticky rice.We also ordered all 4 of the specials: a fish dish that is supposed to be a simulated version of a Thai technique of cooking it in the sun, a scrambled duck egg, and 2 veggie dishes that I couldn't really identify. The fish was just okay, a little dry and not really flavorful. The duck egg was nothing special. The veggie dishes were both pretty good, but some of the girls thought one of them was a little slimy. We also got:Kai Yaang ($18) basically grilled game hen: it was alright. It came with a good tamarind sweet and sour sauce.Papaya pok pok ($9) which is their version of a papaya salad: this is not for the faint of heart. It had a very strong spicy kick to it. My mouth was on fire!Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings ($14.50): these were the winner of the night. No wonder everyone raves about them! They have great flavor and are cooked perfectly. Nice crunch, caramelization, but still juicy! Yum! I'd come back just for these.Khao Soi ($15) A coconut curry based soup: this was pretty good. It reminded me a little bit of panang curry, but soupier. We also each got a drink (cocktails $10 each). I had the Lord Bergamot, which had Bergamot tea infused vodka, honey drinking vinegar, orange liqueur, and soda. It was pretty good. Tasted like iced tea! Not too strong.Overall, we had a good time.

I can say that I'm not impressed. I wanted to satisfy my craving for Italian food and what I'm leaving with is the feeling of being more hungry, which is not typically from an Italian meal. The decor is lovely like a hole in the wall bistro is tight table seating inside and outdoor curbside seating when the weather permits. I enjoyed the company that I was with which made the experience better but the food fell short to expectation. I enjoyed the bread the most out of my meal. I ordered a wine asking for the house Pinot noir. But really it was a Pinot at an $13 price point when really a kraft of the house red was $15. So I wasn't explained that there was a difference and that they didn't have a house Pinot. Next I ordered their clam linguine. The pasta was chewy and had great texture but the overall flavor of the pasta was missing more gusto. I finished my plate still feeling hungry and not truly satisfied. So we went for dessert. I asked between the options which was the best and the waiter said the creme br√ªl√©e. Which this dessert beings excitement from its presentation alone. It came out flamb√©. But the flavor didn't delight me like my favorite dessert typically does. It was like a thick pana cotta with a sugar crust. Very creamy but didn't have that light decadence that I was seeking. I did get a tiramisu for my boyfriend that tasted way better in the to go box. But they didn't dress it up like the one I saw at the table next to me when they ordered it at the restaurant.

Now that it doesn't apply to me, and I'm not often in the area, I have an out-of-sight, out-of-mind response.I do still get takeout every so often, though. Most recently, I grabbed the portobello and tofu fajitas. The mushrooms were incredible, and I probably could have just eaten a whole plateful of them. And perhaps guacamole. All the other various ingredients hovered somewhere in the \\"adequate\\" to \\"pretty good\\" range.Takeout is still nice and speedy.

We ordered the Khao Soi ($16.50), Catfish with vermicelli ($16.25), Baby back ribs ($16.75), Pork belly/shoulder curry ($16.75), and the Chicken wings ($16.75). The wings had a good sweet/sour/spicy flavor. While they were good, I don't feel like they were amazing. I probably prefer the wings from Sang Tung (San Francisco) or Chan Chan (Irvine). The Catfish with vermicelli was nice and light to cut through all the other heavy and savory items that we ordered. Seasoned perfectly and the catfish was very tender. Baby back ribs came with 2 really delicious sauces and the meat tasted great on its own too. It came off the bone easily. Pork belly curry was delicious. The meat crumbles in your mouth and is nice and rich, perfect with rice. Khao Soi was almost everyone's favorite dish. It's savory yet not too heavy so you feel like you could drink the curry soup all day. Noodles had good texture, but the chicken meat was very forgetful. Overall, the portions were a little small for the cost. The food itself was really really good though. I would come here again but would make reservations in advance.

Island Creek Oyster Bar has hands down the best raw oysters in town! The service was excellent. The dishes were well presented. The portion size was just right. The food came out in a timely manner. The meal was well-paced.Our server Jillian was warm and knowledgeable about the different kinds of oysters on the menu. She asked whether we liked salty or sweet oysters. After we ordered, she brought us a basket of sourdough bread with sweet butter on the side. For drinks, I'd recommend the Reissdorf Kolsch Ale and the Arnold Palmer. This was not your typical Arnold Palmer with the half black iced tea and half lemonade. At Island Creek Oyster Bar, they make their Arnold Palmer with the half green menthos tea and half lemonade. We started our meal with the oysters from the raw bar. We got the Island Creek oysters from Duxbury, MA which were buttery as well as sweet and salty at the same time. We also got the Hama Hama oysters from Lilliwaup, WA which were creamy, cucumber, and had a grassy taste.  The oysters were very well shucked clean, served on a shell, on a silver platter of crushed ice. These oysters were served with course salt, cocktail sauce, white vinegar, and other bottled condiments (e.g., malted vinegar, ketchup, mustard, sriracha, tabasco, etc). After the oysters, we shared the followed dishes: (1) No Shell Prince Edward Island Mussels in White Wine Cream and Parsley, (2) Maine Lobster Pappardelle, and (3) Grilled Steelhead Trout. The Mussels appetizers consisted of petite sized mussels and pearl pasta cooked in a white wine cream, garnished with grated parsley, and served with a grilled toast. The dish was quite flavorful - creamy, milky, and rich. The pearl pasta added character to the dish. The Lobster pasta consisted of pappardelle, chopped lobster meat, shiitake mushrooms, and rapini tossed in miso butter, sprinkled with hint of cayenne pepper, and garnished with toasted almonds. It was phenomenal. The dish had the right touch of butter! The trout was served with red bliss potatoes, artichoke, nicoise olives in walnut cream. In terms of fullness, it was as heavy as salmon. It was cooked to medium and had a smooth texture. We ended our meal with a Banoffee Pie aka a Banana Cream Pie.

Having been to several Torchy's, I'm always pleased with their service and their food. Prices are very good too. Just one taco is plenty and the tacos are packed with so much flavor that my taste buds beg for more but my brain knows that one is enough! I love the Doppleganger soda too.\\nToday at 3:15 pm after working straight through lunch, I was so ready for something delicious and quick. Knowing there was a Torchy's just 10 minutes away but knowing if I went at that time I would get stuck in traffic as a result, I went anyway. The traffic I endured once I left the restaurant was totally worth it! My Torchy's craving was satisfied. There is a price to pay for instant gratification and this day I was willing to pay that price--traffic or no traffic--Torchy's was my destination!   Today I went for the Trailer Park Taco which consists of yummy fried chicken, green chilies, lettuce and cheese. I like to get this taco  \\"trashy\\" by adding lettuce, queso, and poblano sauce. Of course the Doppleganger soda complimented the taco. So good and left satisfied!\\nThe staff at Torchy's always has a smile and is pleasant. For first timers--make sure to order the queso--its beyond fabulous and is a must. Oh, and they provide free refills on chips with the queso.

Words like \\"lust\\" and  \\"love\\" and \\"goddess\\" permeate their menu, but the food is no schtick. Rarely do you find such satisfying vegan and vegetarian eats! The food hear comforts the soul and tantalizes the taste bud but still allows you to leave with a clean tummy and conscience. I tried a bowl - I forgot the name, the one with juicy mushrooms - and the Love Alive smoothie. Though I got a large bowl, I didn't feel super full afterwards, as it's mostly veggies and brown rice. I do wish my bowl came with more mushrooms, since that was  heavily advertised, but it was still pretty tasty. I would really recommend my friend's Swami bowl, however, if you're not averse to cheese. It's got cheddar mixed in with the rice and almost tastes like junk food! I'll definitely be getting that next time. They also make their own hot sauce, which is to die - oops, LIVE - for as well.Their smoothies are super thick and heavy, so combined with a meal, it put me over the edge of satiation. The Love Alive is made with strawberry, banana, coconut ice cream, raw cacao, ginger, and dates (I may be missing some stuff) and is a seriously delicious take on the classic StraBa. I would come again just for a smoothie!If you're into healthy eats but also a lover of flavor, that's what Live Alive does best.

So I do definitely recommend it for those who want to have a nice evening out. \\nIf there is one thing that I did not like too much about the restaurant, it was the brightness level. I had 8:30pm reservation, and when I went in, it was rather dark to a point where I could not really distinguish the proper color of the food. It was not too bothersome, yet a bit brighter light would be better.\\nMy waiter was very nice and polite, yet he could not really keep with it till the very end. I wanted to have a little chat with him while making the payment to thank him for his service and the pleasant evening. However, as soon as I made the payment, he walked away while I was talking. I do understand that he must have been busy, because there were a lot of people, but walking away when someone is talking is flat-out rude. \\nBistro Du Midi does not deserve 5 stars. Maybe 4, or 4.5. While it does have the class of a five-star restaurant, attention to each customer, especially during a busy time, gets rather disappointing.

But, do keep it mind, when they stated that the broth is rich, it is very rich and thick.  I normally see the garlic ramen referred to as \\"kuro\\" which is their blacken garlic oil. This disn't isn't a \\"kuro\\" ramen.  The garlic flavor is more towards the middle and ending notes for me.  I can see after a while, the garlic can be a bit too much for some. The chashu that came with the dish normally is on the meatier side, not so much fat to it, and chewier than normal, but that's also because its a leaner cut than normal too. The egg was seasoned and whole, warm gooey yolk when bit into. And, I order a side of pork belly, and boy that was super fatty. Chicken Karaage: big pieces, crispy still even when we ate it at the end of the meal. The spicy mayo had more of a tang than spicy.Potato Croquette: Fluffy, sweet, rich, and crispy. I didn't mind the sauce being drizzled on, definitely looks better on presentation. My friend on the other side love the sauce, so he preferred to have a dish on the side to dip into.Service: staff was super nice!

It is a \\"private club\\" but anyone can come and pay $10 to get in on the weekend.  Whatever.    This latest trip I with a couple of other New Yorkers.  One who just moved down here, and another who was visiting him.   I joked that this was one of the closest things to club with a list, but it really is more like a \\"best in breed\\" Upper East Side nlounge.   I mean, the place lacks any diversity in either race or fashion (think guys in Polos and shorts, and ladies in the most basic of Southern Dresses).   Granted, this is the Highlands, a laid back scene which is to the core, white-bread boring.     But you know, when I look at cities like Dallas where fashion and semi private lounges are done correct and on-point, I can't help but think- FAIL.The good news is they do play good music.  Think like late 90s hip-hop, and I think I even heard Ace Of Bass.   So no, they do not take the place too serious.     I also like the outdoor patio outside.   The bad news is there is only one bathroom for each of the sexes.     Often excessive time is taken for what i presume to be \\"extracurriculars\\".    And you know, in a normal nightclub indulgences are relegated to perhaps a stall or just a section of the Men's restroom.  Here (and yes I have seen more then a fair share of people wired here) it can really make for a long restroom line which is a real drag.Drinks are overpriced, but I guess it is kind of a club, so it kind of makes sense?  Lights came on at 2:30, Everyone was kicked out by 2:45.  That was for sure weak.

You can choose the spiciness level here for the stews and I'm glad I got the mild one because even the medium was a bit too much heat for me. The seafood pancake was dense but surprisingly well done. Everything was cooked through well, the outside was crispy and the inside had the perfect amount of softness. Good balance of seafood and veggies. The soft tofu stew was a bit disappointing. It had one mussel, one shrimp and a bunch of tiny shrimp. The egg comes pre-added and the tofu was too chunky for my liking. This dish comes with white rice.

I definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you haven't already!"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"After my recent review of Powell's Burnside store, I received a reply from one \\"Beth L.,\\" a customer service manager for http://www.powells.com. She indicated that Mr. Powell himself had asked her to respond to my concerns. Her response follows:\\n---\\nMy name is Beth. Mr. Powell asked me to respond to you. First, thank you for taking the time to write this letter. We always seek to improve our products and services. You have given us concrete examples to work with.I want to try to give a good sense of how I think we can use this feedback you have offered.1. About the book prices. This is tough; we want to be competitive in the marketplace and we have some stiff competition! Used books are a central part of our business and buying the right book and pricing at the right price will keep us in business, long term. These days customers are even more avid bargain hunters and we'll do what we can to offer them great deals.2. The book buyers. Our buyers are some of the best in the business. We buy over 20,000 used books every week though our stores and our website. Balancing our ever-changing inventory needs with the books being presented, coupled with our high condition standards is going to cause disappointment. Honestly, Will, I feel the same way when I try to sell books and they pass on some or all of them. I think \\"These are great books! I bought them here!\\" I am surprised that someone told you over the phone that we would buy a particular book. That is very unusual and we don't normally do that because of exactly what you encountered - we might have given you wrong information, old information (meaning we bought a copy of that book at another location about the same time you were calling) and of course, we have to verify condition before we buy anything. That was a wasted trip for you and we shouldn't have encouraged you. I am really sorry about that.3. Customer service. Of course we can improve! There is always room to improve how we interact with our customers, whether it's in one of our stores, on the phone or online. I appreciate what you're saying - the idea of all those books can give you a wonderful feeling and you don't want that ruined by a bad interaction.Again, I want to thank you for taking the time to write. Most people don't complain; they don't tell a company why they're taking their business elsewhere.Beth Lyons\\n---I'm a firm believer in the idea that a business says more about itself when it responds to a problem than it does when the problem first occurs. Problems are want to happen in today's business environment and I believe it's important to give every business the opportunity to improve before passing a final judgment. There have even been times when I've revised reviews on Yelp after receiving fantastic customer service in the wake of a disappointing experience.Unfortunately, I'm more than a little disappointed in the response I received with regard to my original review. Beth L. commented that I gave some very specific, concrete examples for her to work with. Her response, in spite of this, seems like little more than the kind of party-line banter I've come to expect from big-box stores and large corporations. As a larger member of the Portland business community, I expected better of Powell's. I was almost shocked that she didn't tell me that you were \\"taking [this] seriously,\\" as it would have fit in perfectly with the balance of your response.As I said in my original review, Powell's is a landmark in Portland, but it seems to have lost sight of what made it great. I look forward to returning when Powell's remembers what it has lost, including addressing concrete problems with more than marshmallow banter.I'm deducting the star I had given in the hopes that Powell's could turn things around. If this is the kind of namby-pamby response they're giving out at the top of the food chain, Powell's isn't what I thought it was -- it's just a local (expensive) alternative to Amazon.com"},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"400 Cochituate Rd","city":"Framingham","stars":"2","text":"Dirty and untrained staff, \\nThe person who takes the order doesn't pay attention to details of your order they get it wrong.They have staff who don't wash their hands and then touch food.I told the manager/whoever is in charge and she said the staff was new and didn't know.This place is a health violation away from getting people sick.....\\nWatch out"},{"name":"Zaza's Cuban Cafe","address":"1 Jeff Fuqua Blvd, Airside 1, Gates 10-19","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Looks like they upgraded from their small shop to a larger space.

I guess this is considered really good Thai food in the area known for their chicken dishes. We got the fish sauce chicken wings, half roasted chicken and the beef curry. The fish sauce wings were super salty. I was only able to eat one and we didn't finish it. The roasted half chicken was good. I hate chicken but they cooked it right. Super good with the sauces and sticky rice. The beef curry was good too but lacked flavor. It needed a bit of spice.

Vegetarian combo: spring rolls that probably came out of a pack and freshly made fried yam and avocado rolls - tasty but nothing to write home about. If only the fried chicken patties in the fried chicken box weren't reconstituted chicken patties - they did such a great fry on it!Service was functional, not the kind with a smile either - they take your order, bring you your food and you go up to the till and wait to pay.

But in exploring my \\"where should I go to lunch today?\\" ponderings, I discovered something I didn't realize about this lovely place:  they have a weekday lunch menu of 10 offerings at $10 or less (including drink!).  If you want to be naughty on your work lunch hour, you can even upgrade that soft drink to a beer or glass of wine for only $2 more too.The Nook is right on Piedmont across the street from the 14th Street entrance gates (aka: at a traffic light for safe crossing even; not like the crazy random crosswalk a few blocks south!).  It has a lovely outdoor patio seating for nice weather days, but also a great indoor space of roomy tables and a big U-shaped bar.   [and for all you Michigan State fans?  it's a place for you. today started the 2018 March Madness tourney and I have y'all going very far, so I'm rooting for you!]  But I digress.Lunchtime was pretty empty, but that's sort of expected on a Thursday.  Our server doubled as the greeter (\\"please wait to be seated\\") so she wasn't there when I first arrived - but no worries; you won't have to wait long.If you're not handed the lunch menu, ask for it to see your offerings.  You can order off that for the deals or from their regular menu as well.  Today I was here with two other companions.  One ordered from the lunch menu (two chicken tacos and blue cheese slaw) -- it came out beautifully presented and very ample; my friend said it was all delicious.  Another (vegetarian -- yes! there are vegeterian options here!) ordered \\"The Tree Hugger\\" and a side of tater tots and not a morsel was left on his plate.I myself decided to make a lunch out of appetizers.  There's a \\"Savory Sliders\\" option here where you can choose from 7  (SEVEN!) different kinds of sliders -- order 4 of them, mix-or-match, for only $10.   I was so delighted to see this option: in a lot of other establishments, you can only order all of the same (or maybe only two choices tops).  This allowed me to try a number of different little offerings, and isn't that the fun part about \\"little bites\\" anyway?  My four were:  the buffalo chicken slider (tasty! but nothing unexpected),  the ginger-soy beef with brie (the smallest of the four but OH worth it! delish!), the pulled pork with Coca-Cola BBQ sauce (YUM!  As are their Coca-Cola BBQ wings, btw) and the chili and cheese hot dog which was the most adorable little tasty hot dog ever.  For reals.  Try to find a cuter and more tasty one out there -- especially for only $2.50 when you do the math. :)I haven't looked how many reviews were already out on Yelp! about The Nook when I started this.  I'm imagining quite a bit, since this place is pretty much a Midtown/Piedmont Park institution now.  But reviews can ebb and flow in positivity over time so that's why I still decided to do one today. The Nook? Still got it, folks.  Great space, tasty food, super friendly staff, incredibly affordable pricing (and psst!  if you can't walk there like I can?  Valet parking too so you don't have to deal with finding parking or dealing with a boot or ticket on your car).  Well done, The Nook.

But once she described the experience as one on par with drinking the cereal milk left from Honey Nut Cheerios, I was interested. SO good, and such an accurate description. I honestly savored every sip.  I would definitely call this a sweet treat and something to save for an occasion, but I think it is unique and truly worth trying at least once. I suspect it tastes less sweet with almond milk because the slight bitter aftertaste of almond milk cuts through the sugar. Came here on what I suspect was a rare slow night since school at nearby UT hadn't picked up yet. So I had ample of cozy seating (and outlets, the real prize) to choose from.

The prawns were really good.  The salad was small.  For the main I had the poached lobster and he had the Surf and Turf.  Both were good.  For dessert we both had the cheesecake, which I would say is average.  Overall it was a nice night out and the food was good but I do feel it was a little overpriced for what it was.

Well it's easy when you posses a $100 gift card to one, so off to Morton's it was. I am a true carnivore; forget the potato or asparagus I only really need one side to accompany my steak - a big ole glass of spicy red wine. So after checking the embellished wine list online I decided it was best to bring my own bottle. I mean even with the ridiculous corkage fee of $40 my wine was still going to cost me less in the end. Morton's does offer a valet service but there's a garage right across the street so I thought it easier to do the same job myself and save the tip. We were greeted with a smile upon entering and asked for our coats. We had made reservations so our table was available as soon as we arrived. The dining room is filled with rich mahogany woods and wine bottles some as big as a five year old. However the ambiance felt a little too dark, luckily my vision is still good or I may have had difficulty reading the menu.  After we sat the waiter brought over an aerator and decanter for my wine which any enthusiast would appreciate. Next was what I had anticipated, the peep show of flesh! They brought out a metal tray covered in plastic which featured their selections of prime hand cut steaks. Even as the waiter began to speak his voice lay silent as my eyes honed in on my prey like a fierce lion of the Serengeti. Behold the 24oz bone in aged rib eye, I had found my prize. I quickly pointed it out proclaiming med rare stat allowing him to save his breath. I wanted to wait not a moment longer before the juicy beef was on my plate. With a $100 bucks burning a hole in our pockets we knew the steaks were at least covered. Therefore we decided to indulge in the lobster bisque for starters. The bowl contained large chunks of lobster constructed like a seafood fortress with a moat of rich, creamy broth protecting it from our spoons. It wasn't too heavy and had just the right amount of cream. However even the tasty lobster couldn't distract me from the main event. When I could wait no longer with my salivary glands reaching maximum production the most beautiful piece of meat was then presented before me. Gazing at the perfectly seared grill marks I plunged my knife into its sweet flesh, my first bite was like butter, melt in your mouth savory goodness. Half way through not intending to eat the whole thing I thought I don't want to let go of this ecstasy, so I saw it though till its end.My recommendation, ask for a gift card and order this steak, if not save up a lot of money for what is sure to be an outstanding meal. Then you to will recite the prayer - blessed Morton's I kneel down and accept thy bounty I am about to receive and praise you for providing such greatness, Amen."},{"name":"110 Grill","address":"170 Forbes Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"Horrifying.

How unfair is that?The food is pretty dang good too and the crazy thing is, it almost comes out TOO fast. I'm used to Italian meals lasting a couple of hours but our full order came out in what seemed like 5 minutes. This was when the restaurant was full. Good food, good atmosphere, reasonable prices.

Big boys gotta eat, ya know? I ordered both the x large pho and the pad thai. I can usually eat everything; I got a big stomach! I severely underestimated the portion. They are GENEROUS. So much food at such an affordable price! Even with the large serving, the quality was not compromised in any form. It was top notch and exceptional.

After reading the reviews, I was nervous that there would be quite a wait, but luckily, since I was dining alone I was able to sit immediately at the counter area. The ambience of Pok Pok definitely evokes a southeast Asian eatery, with its open air and tiki vibes. Definitely a fun casual place that would be good for small groups.The menu has a big selection of dishes, but I decided to order their famous Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (spicy), the chicken Khao Soi Kai, and a side of the sticky rice. The wings were definitely delicious and the sauce was great. I would recommend splitting these with a group since there are 6 large wings in an order. I was also very pleased with the chicken Khao Soi Kai. This is their most popular curry and is good for a single person meal. It's a mild curry with noodles that have just the right amount of bite and chicken that was tender and soaked in the curry sauce. The only thing I wasn't too impressed by was the sticky rice; it was more hard then sticky. I also tried one of the drinks, the mango Alexander, which has mango, vodka, coconut cream, and lime. This is a sweet drink but went with the southeast Asian vibe very well.The service was good - I had to wait a while for the waitress to take my order since the restaurant was so busy, but then I didn't have to wait too long for my food. Overall, I think this is a fun please for casual southeast Asian food. It might be more fun to go with a group so you can try a couple things, but then again it was nice going solo and not having to wait. Definitely worth trying but maybe a weekday would be better with friends!"},{"name":"Summer Moon Coffee - Buda","address":"316 N Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"Love love love this coffee.

My husband and I stopped in for an early dinner Saturday afternoon after reading all the reviews, excited to try the paella. It was 5:30 and we were going to the Amway for a 7pm concert. I figured there would be plenty of time for dinner. There was no wait, and we headed to the bar for some happy hour drinks. First off, I was so pleased that happy hour ran on weekends. This was a great start to our evening! We ordered some sangria (delicious) and a few small plates. When it came time to order dinner, we had our hearts set on paella. To our disappointment, we found out that the paella takes at least 45 minutes to make, and we didn't have the luxury of time to wait for it. We had to pass and ordered some more tapas instead. In total, we tried:- meatballs - ok, but the sauce tasted like it came from a jar. \\n- babaghanoush - delicious, some of the best I've had! \\n- ceviche - excellent, fresh and flavorful, good portion for the price. \\n- croquetas - crispy and delicious on the outside, but strange ground meat on the inside. I was expecting ground meat, but this was more of a meat paste. Overall, everything we tried was good. It's a great atmosphere at that time of day, really chill and relaxing. The drinks are great and the prices for happy hour are awesome.

I have to give heir bBq a 4 instead of a 5 just based on such great other BBQ in the area.  However this is a good solid and the service inside and for group orders is the best in my opinion in Austin.They do offer delivery for a few (use outside vendor) which honestly had been hit or miss (way too early or late delivery) but maybe they have the kinks worked out.When I have a pick up time (i.e. 10:45) I have never waited more than 5 minutes for my group meal.

We had hardly started unpacking our food and we had a hot naan waiting for us. That kind of speed on a Saturday night was unheard of! But what won it for me, was the service they provide as a part of Fooda. They cater sometimes for lunch for my workplace in Cambridge. The two guys from Bollywood cafe are extreme warm and exude happiness. You can't help but smile, genuinely smile and be happy for the 30 seconds that they are giving you your food. The display was not working in our location so one of them asked me if I had a sticky note they could borrow to write what the dishes were. When I came back with a Post It and a pen, the guy thanked me and handed me a free mango lassi. It maybe a small thing, but it made my day. I'm still smiling. Bollywood cafe has a very special place in my heart now. I felt like I was back home, and they were my family.

I guess I can relate my own experience.We have all heard about the decline of the bookstore. Various reasons for this phenomenon have been posited, in no particular order:1) Americans read less than they used to, and they didn't read much to begin with.\\n2) Those who do read get their books from Amazon or other online retailers.\\n3) \\"There ain't no good bookwriters no more\\"\\n4) Big Box bookstores such as Waldenbooks and Borders weren't profitable anymore.Well, all of the above may vary in their degree of truthfulness, but regardless, Powell's carries on. A full block on the edge of downtown Portland, a city for which there seems to be plenty of activity in spite of the streets themselves not overflowing with vehicular traffic houses this homage to the literate.We were about halfway through our annual vacation when we started our three night stay in this city on the Willamette River. Given our hotel was a mere three blocks away, we opted to simply walk over. I'll just say that the amount of purchases we made almost made us wish we had elected to Uber back to our hotel, but the bags were strong enough for the journey (plus, a stop at a nearby doughnut shop encouraged us).Needless to say, there is no shortage of selections of reading material to choose from here - I got myself plenty of obscure sports books, and a few odes to travel as well. Wife got herself some scary novels, along with a few guides to help her teach.One can also caffeinate while here, with any number of bean options, lending creedence to the great John Craigie that Portlandians do in fact take their coffee pretty seriously.

My girlfriend ordered a glass of rose with the waitress's recommendation and loved it but I just stuck with water. We tried 2 of 3 different types of oysters and not surprisingly the Island Creek were easily the best. All the oyster options were fresh and served with hot sauce choices, lemon, and vinegar. After our raw oysters, we wanted to try some friend oyster sliders which were easily the best thing I ate during our 4 day stay in Boston. Fried to perfection, these oysters were served on a pillow bun with a great complimenting sauce. For our main courses, we had the salmon and a white fish they had on the menu (I forget the name). The salmon was cooked perfectly and again the sauce served with it was great! I finished the entire plate and had no shame. The portion size was exactly what I expected from a nicer place like ICOYB but it was easily enough food to fill us up without feeling weighed down.

Before we were seated she told us the special for the night and recommend we check out the buffet and see if we liked what was available. We decided to do the buffet and it did not disappoint!!!- The chicken Alfredo had an amazing distinctive taste that had us going back for more! - The golden honey dipped fried chicken reminded me of a southern after church soul food dinner.- The raw oysters and mussels were well seasoned and appetizing!- My wife is a die hard crab fan, she was very satisfied going back for multiple clusters. (The only odd taste was the butter, but we used the butter sauce from the mussels to compensate) Key lime pie & pecan pie were amazzzzing!Now to top everything off, there was a gentleman (assuming the manager) who consistently made sure the food was available when it got low, and made sure we were ok. I overheard him say in the kitchen \\"Great job everyone I'll praise you when you're doing good, and will definitely let you know when improvement is needed\\" I loved every bit of that!!! The very last icing on the cake was when a young lady and her son came in to eat. The mother had to step outside to make a phone call, and the young boy went up to get lobster at the buffet. The \\"assumed manager\\" asked the young man if he ever had lobster before, he said no.

When he finished serving the other side of the table he came to us to pour and someone asked politely, \\"What kind of wine is this?\\" (We didn't pay attention when my friend ordered it on the other side of the table) The manager just shrugged and said, \\"It's the best kind.\\" Really dude? So I pushed it, because virtually 0% of me is friendly when I'm irritated and I said, \\"It looks like a Chianti, can you tell us more about it, please?\\" And he blatantly ignored me. Just like the waiter did when we first sat down and I had to ask for a cocktail to start with. And we had to ASK him to refill our water, and ASK for coffee and dessert.

And I must say I wasn't disappointed! First impression: \\nThe location is a little bit hidden in the corner of ATL Tech Village building; so I actually had never noticed it until I saw a colleague of mine holding the cup one day! Since I walked to the place, I didn't have trouble finding it, but I probably wouldn't notice it or wouldn't know where to park my car if I was driving... so that's a little inconvenient I would say. Other than that, the coffee place itself is very cozy and cute, and the staff is very very friendly and attentive. They have some pastry options as well as some food options, aside from coffee and lattes. Coffee:\\nSince it was my first time, I asked the Barista about his favorite drink and he suggested the Ethiopia Pour-over blend and I went for it. I think the price was about $4.20 for a 12 ounce. The coffee is pretty smooth and flavorful. I rarely get the regular coffee at starbucks and I normally go for a flat white or a espresso drink - mostly because I think their regular coffee tastes burnt (talking about Starbucks). My colleague ended up not ordering anything, since she wanted to get her \\"points\\" from Starbucks, but I bet she was pretty pissed at me by the time we got back to the office because I kept going on and on about how smooth the coffee tastes... haha! Cons: \\nI haven't tried out anything else other than the Ethiopian blend, so I have nothing negative to say about the food or the atmosphere so far, and will definitely be returning to try more drinks! Though the only negative thing is that they close very early. Their other location in midtown is open until 11, but I feel like the one in Buckhead doesn't get as busy mostly because of where it's located; and often people don't even notice it. So, that's the only thing that sucks for people like me, who would like to hang out at a coffee place past 7:00pm... lolOverall, I will definitely be returning to get another cup of the Ethiopia and perhaps try out their flat white and latte! Love the atmosphere! Worth \\"sacrificing\\" Starbucks points to get coffee from here instead.. :)"},{"name":"Coquille Fine Seafood","address":"181 Carrall St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Came here for a late lunch.Service was outstanding.

This is what I call authentic mexican food. Food: I had the pastor, plantain, pescado, and chicken mole taco along with their maracuya drink. They also have their own homemade sauces/salsa which is sooooo good. I have to say the pescado and plantain were the yummiest! But my #1 would be the plantain taco. I have to say, I've never seen a taco with plantain before so that was interesting! The tacos are bigger than most places! Whenever I got tacos from other places 3-4 tacos usually don't fill me up! But this place for sure is so yummy and so filling. Maizal also offers their own made drinks, I tried their maracuya drink (passion fruit and chia seeds) hands down so good and refreshing. The drink was not too sweet, it was JUST RIGHT. It had a light taste, and the chia seeds in the drink were really good. I want some more maracuya just thinking about it. Since I checked in on yelp, I got a free churro!! The churro was pretty good!! It's not too sweet but just perfect. I'm very happy they sell jarritos here!Tl;dr The plantain & pescado tacos were the best. The maracuya drink was also the best. THESE 3 ITEMS ARE MUST TRIES.Customer Service: The owner and other employees who served our food and cleaned our table were all very awesome! The owner let my friends and I have a sample of the maracuya drink since we were all so curious about it! 10/10 He sold me on that one!! Great customer service, very nice!

The dining options in Terminal B are truly grim, but this little Cuban cafe is surprisingly good. I had an excellent cup of brewed dark roast this morning that had good balance and flavor. The Cuban ham egg and cheese sandwich hit all the required points: salty ham, egg that was actually scrambled and seasoned nicely, gooey cheese, and soft bread. It would have been better pressed on the panini grill like a regular Cubano, but it was darn tasty. The guava pastries aren't bad but not great either.

The big Kahuna. The mother lode. So many books, aisles, and sections that it's possible you will get lost. There's probably no other place I would have rather gotten lost in than in Powell's Books. The only reason we actually left is because we came here nearing closing time. Twice. Another point to keep in mind if you're not hoping to escape reality and lose all sense of time is DON'T OPEN ANY BOOKS. Just judge them by their cover. Even then, you'll still be stuck in a sea of books, tangled in a hot mess of a basket full of literature. There are used books, new books, red books, blue books (I wouldn't even be surprised if they carried the car appraisal ones!) Stacks that start on the floor and seem to reach all the way to the ceiling, then all the way across the room. That's just 1/5th of the mystery section in one of the rooms. Their handy computers around the store help you find what you are looking for fairly quickly. Books are priced based on their quality/age if they're used, but have the standard sticker price on some of their newer books (but no sales tax-- woo!). Definitely make some time to check this place out. When my friend told me a bookstore was something to see in Portland, I was more than doubtful about that claim.

That is how I would describe my experience at MF Sushi Atlanta. Upon walking into the restaurant, you are greeted with serenity. The restaurant, though smaller than expected, was designed with simplicity - delivering a calm atmosphere. An atmosphere that allowed my family and I to truly focus on the meal before us, and let me tell you, it was exquisite.\\n \\nThe Food:\\nRather than individually ordering a few items, my family decided to order multiple dishes and simultaneously enjoy the freshness of each dish. Our meal consisted of the following 12 dishes (it was also very filling for our family of 4):\\n \\nBaked Scallops\\nAbsolutely delicious - the Japanese mayonnaise kept the dish from being dry while at the same time did not cause the dish to feel heavy. I believe this dish was topped with bread crumps - creating a nice crispy texture in juxtaposition of the tenderness of the scallop.    \\n \\nFresh yellowtail\\nThe yellowtail was my first taste of sashimi at MF and will not be my last. Topped with cilantro, Serrano peppers, and what I believe was ponzu sauce. The yellowtail would simply melt in my mouth and along with the ponzu sauce filled my taste buds with a delectable sweetness. The peppers and cilantro were just the perfect amount to give this dish more texture.\\n \\nKampachi (I believe it was the MF Signature not appetizer)\\nClean and refreshing is how I would describe this dish. The Kampachi MF signature has got to be my favorite. The amberjack was sliced thinly - which provided the perfect amount to chewiness. When you first bite into a piece, your mouth is immediately welcomed with the sweetness of the fish. The sweetness is balanced out with the lime, and before it can even taste sour - the flavors are cut due to the Himalayan rock salt - creating a melody of taste on your tongue. This dish is truly an amazing creation.\\n \\nO-Toro MF signature\\nAt most sushi restaurants I avoid O-Toro (super fatty tuna) because of how greasy and dense the fish could be. To my surprise, the O-Toro MF signature was not oily at all, and I find that it is because of the quality of the fish and the truffle. The truffle soy added a unique flavor that seemed to cleanse your mouth from the fattiness of the fish.\\n \\nSake MF signature\\nLike the O-Toro, I typically do not favor salmon sashimi/nigiri because of the fatty nature of the fish. I did not think that the Salmon's fattiness was cut as much as the O-Toro's had been, but unlike most places - the salmon really melts in your mouth (I honestly don't remember chewing for this dish). I think the black pepper was supposed to serve the same purpose as the truffle soy did for the O-toro (it did somewhat).\\n \\nAma-ebi Nigiri (Sweet prawn shrimp)\\nThe Ama-ebi was my most anticipated dish because it came with fried prawn heads. The nigiri part of the dish was so creamy. The prawn was creamy enough to almost be overwhelming, but the lime slices perfectly underwhelms the creaminess.  The prawn heads were perfectly crispy and fresh and when dipped in the sauce served with it, there was no sense of fishiness. The Ama-ebi truly met all expectations.\\n \\n \\nUni\\nThis was my first time trying uni, and it was strongly recommended by one of my friends. Perhaps it doesn't meet well with my taste preferences, as I did find it to be too fishy.  \\n \\nMaguro\\nI did not really have any expectations for the Maguro since it is commonly sold, and I doubted it could really vary from other places. However, the texture of the Maguro truly made a statement. MF sushi has the highest quality sushi I have had in Atlanta. The Maguro did not have as many tendons (?) - which allowed for a really nice chewy but tender bite.\\n \\nSoft shell crab roll\\nCrispy. Crunchy. Clean. MF truly has an ability to perfectly harmonize taste and texture - making sure nothing is overpowering the other. This roll seemed to be heavy (after all it is fried soft shell crab) but in actuality was a very light, but filling roll.  \\n \\nSpicy Tuna Osaka Box Style Roll, Toro Osaka Box Style roll, and Lobster Box.\\nBox style roll is where the sushi is made in layers pressed in a box. We tried all three. All three were delicious - I enjoyed the lobster box the most (it was crispy and warm - making a nice compliment to the sushi rice). The toro Osaka box was my least favorite as the toro had been grounded up (you couldn't really enjoy the sashimi that way). My favorite part of these rolls though had to be the rice - cooked to perfection; you could taste each individual grain (not too sticky, not too coarse). In all honestly I would order these again just for the rice!\\n \\nOverall, MF sushi was a pleasurable experience. The service was paced perfectly so that you would have time between each dish and the atmosphere really amped the entire experience. MF sushi Atlanta is definitely worth every penny."},{"name":"Tonno Wakefield","address":"175 North Ave","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4","text":"Dinner May 20.  Prior reviews said the place was cold.

You know it's legit because the menu says they use it fish sauce from Phu Quoc.  A must if visiting Portland just for these wings.  Came here in the middle of the day in between our time at the International Beerfest.  Beer and Chicken Wings.  The perfect match.  Made my way to Pok Pok but before we got there, CALLED-IN OUR ORDER. (Everyone should do this if you are planning to do take-out)  Got there, found parking nearby and walked to the restaurant.  Walked over to the Take-Out window and there they were, already packed and ready for me to inhale.  Paid and grabbed a few necessities (Napkin and Wet Naps) Grab a few extra... You are going to need it...Ordered 3 orders for the three of us.  2 spicy and 1 non-spicy.  I enjoyed the spicy more than the non-spicy but my friends enjoyed the non-spicy more.  You get 6 wings, which is a bit pricey for the amount of money you pay but it was so good that you don't necessarily feel ripped off.  So you take your first bite and you taste the honey, the fish sauce, the moist chicken, the chicken fat.  What more can you ask for?  Oh yea, you get pickled radishes and carrots too. (Of course this makes you feel better for eating the wings because there are some veges that come along with it)  So why did I like the spicy wings more than the regular?  A couple of reasons. 1) I love spicy foods. Just looking at the red chili flakes sprinkled across the wings gets the saliva flowing. 2) The spiciness makes the wings taste not as sweet.  For my taste, the non-spicy wings were a bit too sweet so the spiciness cut through the spiciness.  One other thing my friends mentioned was that it was a bit salty, which of course makes sense since they used fish sauce but to me, the salti-ness was FLAVOR!  You don't want it bland right? (If that's even possible with these wings...)The wings are great. The service was great and quick. Being able to call-in was a plus.  My friend told me that you didn't need to try anything else but I am now hooked and I am intrigued and want to see what else they have.  If I ever make it back to Portland, I will put Pok Pok as a high priority to try (again)."},{"name":"Comella's","address":"417 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I love the meat sauce!!!!!!

I've dined at Ceviche more times than I can count over the years, and have always had a great experience. And depending on when you go, the experience is different.On Tuesdays, you can stop by for their Tapas Tuesday and choose from a menu of selected tapas at a discounted price. Wednesdays = half off bottles of wine. And they also have a nice happy hour, again with a select menu of tapas and drinks at a discounted price.A word of advice: Plan to share. This place is the best when you order a good number of tapas for the table and share amongst everyone.A few of my favorites:\\n- Casa Ceviche\\n- Salmon A La Plancha\\n- Pollo Al Ajillo\\n- Queso De Cabra\\n- Vegetales A La ParrillaI do also enjoy their sangria very much and recommend you give that a try if you like that sort of thing.Ceviche is a favorite stop of mine for a tasty dinner before seeing a show at the Dr. Phillips Center as well.

I ate more of the regular dishes then the sushi but the nigiri I did have was excellent for a buffet.

Having mixed reviews, I gave the benefit of the doubt to try and support this humble looking restaurant.  Seemed very authentic!\\nWhen we arrived, we were obviously their first customers.  The owner and some other Korean lady was sitting at the first table next to the register window and talked for a good 5 minutes and told us to sit anywhere from afar.  Not receiving menus or drink we literally had to wait til their conversation was over.  The younger lady later came by and gave us the menu and some drink that I'm guessing some rice water?  \\nThe young lady later left and the owner then came by and asked what we wanted.  Everything we asked about or asked to recommend she shook her head like \\"omg\\" following that was \\"you try and see\\".Unhelpfully we ordered the following:\\n--Sahlgogee Gooksu (1/5) - Super bland soup, but it had an awful smell to it.  Usually with beef bones, you would want to boil it first to clean out impurities of the the bones and drain it out.  I don't think that was the case here and you know by the texture of the meat which was very tough. \\n--Sundae Gook (1/5) - Soup was bland, the blood sausage had no taste to it other than just the clear thin noodles in it.  It had a weird smell to it worse than the sahlgogee gooksu.My partner actually ordered the Yuk Gae Jang, but instead he received the blood sausage soup.  He asked her opinion about both and I guess she wrote down the wrong one.  She didn't repeat our order to be sure, but he also didn't want to complain after it already came out.  He accepted his fate.--Haemool Pajun (1/5) - At first the first few bites weren't bad, it was slightly burnt but as you get to the center of the pancake it was very mushy.  The seafood had a fishy odor to it, especially the oyster.  Since I wasn't enjoying the soup, I was just eating the pancake for the sake of my hunger.  Later, we found a curly piece of hair stuck to the batter!  Literally just dropped everything and asked for the tab. (This is why places require hairnets in the kitchen)I do have to say the 4 sides we got were pretty good.  The potatoes were actually soft and warm, bean sprouts were savory and good amount of sesame oil, the kimchi was on point.  I didn't like the radish but my partner did.  They only do \\"1 refill\\" for side dishes FYI...i've personally never seen that before.Asking for something seemed so difficult as it seemed like the younger waitress wasn't having it that day.  She served us for the rest of our meal.  (She came later on after our order was taken)  Food was just getting bad to worse.  The only thing I would say I appreciate most was the girl took the pancake off of the tab."},{"name":"Royal Rasoi Indian Cuisine","address":"3821 Lake Emma Rd","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4","text":"Although the atmosphere and waiters were nice, the pani puri and bhel puri were a waste of our money, lacking flavor.

There was nothing special about the Mint Chocolate Chip, but I liked the Cuban Coffee-it had a cool cold brew taste to it. The Mango was good, light in taste, and not too sweet. The Amber Rose had crunchy rock candy, but was too sweet as it was cotton candy flavored. We checked into Yelp to receive an extra scoop ($1 off), or they give you 10% off your order if you like them on Facebook or Instagram.

They literally sell better sushi pre-packaged at my local grocery store. The waitress was at least nice enough to take it off my check. When the server seats you, they tell you that since this is \\"Izakaya\\" style, the dishes come out at different times. My friend and I both ordered the beef bowel, the second of which came out about ten minutes after the first one. Pretty sure identical items don't fall under the category of \\"they come out when they're ready\\" since they're made of the same ingredients and take the exact same amount of time to prepare. The kitchen must be totally disorganized. Said beef bowels were less than mediocre. I didn't even bother eating the hard, undercooked rice at the bottom of the bowl, although I scarfed down the flavorless, tiny portion of \\"beef\\" on top that more resembled pulled pork than anything else. The experience was bad from top to bottom, and we basically ate our food as quickly as possible so we could leave and go back to the hotel to order room service, which was gourmet in comparison to the slop served here.

I went to Nori Nori twice in Nov. 2014 and Dec. 2014. I went to Lobster House and Tokyo Bay both in Dec. Also, I need to let others know that I am Chinese and have a very Asia palette. Therefore, if you're looking for good fried rice or fried chicken, my review may not be useful for you. Also, there may be some day to day variance in the restuarants since different chefs may be on duty that day. With that said. I think the sashimi is the best compared to Lobster House and Tokyo Bay. There is a wide selection and all of the food were well made and flavorful. The only down side I found was that the crab legs are served cold and they will not steam them. Also the price is a bit higher than Lobster House and Tokyo Bay, by about $5. Thus, if you don't care about the price, then it's worth it cause you get much better sushi, and a wider selection. If you just want mostly seafood and the price is factored into your decision, I think in terms of value, Lobster House may be the better option. Lobster House has boiled, but fresh crab legs, pretty good sashimi, and cooked entries that are more suited to the Asian taste. Lobster House also has cracked lobster claws. If you want good sushi, or a wide selection of hot entries, then Nori Nori is the best option."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is the coolest thai place we know!

I don't have much experience with Moroccan food -- it reminds me of something between Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine -- but if it's always this good, I'll have to eat it more often.  The cakes and sausage had the same kind of sauce, some sort of spicy tomato base with strong undertones of olive and cumin.  It tasted great in the rice and I practically inhaled it.  The eggs were a nice silky compliment to the meal as well, a bit smaller than I'm used to, but with a more concentrated flavor.  The tea was surprisingly sweet and rich, a real treat.  I was also very impressed by the price, only about $25 for the whole meal, which could easily cost twice that much at a lot of comparable restaurants.

Typically when I travel I try to find the independent places I have never tried, but once in a while I want to go to the tried and true restaurants I enjoy at home in Jacksonville. At Maple Street I know I can depend on the best biscuits anywhere. Seriously they are light and fluffy, perfectly cooked every time and flavorful even without the toppings, but the toppings make a good thing even better. We stopped in this location on a Saturday morning and service was super quick and the employees were fun and friendly. I ordered my favorite, the farmer, which has a juicy chicken breast fried with a crispy coating and a hint of maple syrup, covered in cheddar cheese, thick peppered bacon, and the delectable house made apple butter. Good to the last crumb for sure. The five and dime is my son's go to biscuit, with the spicy sausage gravy on top of a biscuit with the chicken, cheese, and eggs. Crazy indulgent, but there are also options for the more health conscience and the vegetarians in my family. I haven't personally tried the salads but they look beautiful. The biscuits do have  plenty of non-meat topping options including a vegetarian version of the rich and creamy gravy. The pepper jelly also deserves an honorable mention, so sweet and spicy. I always highly recommend Maple Street for the coffee as well. Love the maple coffee but on a hot day the iced coffee is perfectly refreshing and awakening. You really cannot go wrong with any menu item at Maple Street, and this location has a bonus of being located in a cute little area perfect for a walk around the pond after brunch."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was in Portland visiting and my friend took me to Pok Pok for my birthday dinner.

I can't read your life story on my phone before ordering from the menu.\\" [Time & Date of visit]: Weeknight Around 7pm.[Party Size]: 2[Location/Ambiance]: \\nI've visited around lunch time when they have a lunch buffet quite a few times but never reviewed. I feel like that keeps the place pretty busy for that time duration. Though for dinners, there were maybe 4 other tables and a couple at the bar. Seems like the place dies down quite a bit for dinner time. \\n[Service]:\\nLunch seems to be attentive. Dinner...eh...more like hardly any, except when taking orders and serving the food. I don't think even once we even got a water refill. [Food Highlights]:\\nFor dine in only, sushi + rolls are half off. I'm not too sure about getting the sashimi as some rolls didn't taste exceedingly fresh. As we stuck mainly with cooked rolls.While the server brought out the food, he did not explain which rolls were which exactly. So I'll just have to review the ones that I visually remember. Seaweed Salad - Though it's a decent size portion for two, it's missing something. All I could think was, Super H mart has prepackaged ones that tasted better. Spider roll - 5 pieces - The end cuts were a lot wider than I was hoping for. Nothing standing out too much or any distinct taste with the soft shell crab. A little bare on it though. Meh.Dragon Roll - 7-8 pieces - My staple roll to order, as I'm very fond of bbq eel. But, I'm not really excited for this one too much. Good cuts of eel on each roll, but just wasn't really wowed by the flavors. Super Alaskan Roll - 8 pieces -  Though my bestest did ask for no cream cheese and if anything could be substituted, (even more veggies, really, anything. Hell even put more rice!) our server informed us that add anything \\"extra\\" would constitute an additional $2 charge, ( I wonder if it that charge would be half off though, ahhh!) regardless what the \\"extra\\" was. I'm not a fan of cream cheese on sushi, but I'll slather it on my bagel. The avocado was really lacking tonight. Salmon wasn't on point with the freshness. Just decent enough. Flaming Joy Roll - Not wowed by this roll either. Very heavily drenched in sauce. So-So. Lenox Roll - I can't remember much about this roll. So I guess that concludes that, not good enough to remember. \\n[Total Bill  & Tax]: 43.90{Summary}: I feel like if you have just graduated up from Ru-Sans or the like, Kiku would be the next stop, before you leap to a better sushi restaurant with much more fresh seafood. I feel the value might still be with the lunch buffet. But even with it being half off for dinner, just fill up on the cooked stuff.

When we walked through the front doors we were greeted like family. We made reservations since we had a group of seven.  The owners of the restaurant are down to earth people. They have a very good happy hour from 3:00PM to 7:00PM daily. We ordered a variety of appetizers on the happy hour 2 for $10. I really enjoyed the creamy provolone with the garlic focaccia bread bites and the calamari. We all loved creamy provolone and it was gone in about a minute. I ordered the eggplant stack and I enjoyed it very much. The meatballs were delicious. By my surprise the veggie meatball was my favorite and several other people loved the roasted vegetables in the meatball and fell in love with it also. Several people at the table said the crab ball was fantastic. The regular meatball was also very moist and packed with flavor. Make sure you same room for dessert because it is fantastic. Loved the mini cannoli, cheesecake and lemon torte.  I wished I would have tried the tiramisu.   It looked very good. What goes along great with dessert is an espresso. The espresso beans are not bitter and it was super smooth. Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu. Liz was our server and did a fantastic job!

When you get there, you have an option to dine in or get take out.  Most of their seating was outdoor. You do get the feel of how you eat in the streets of Bangkok. We decided to get take out since it was pretty cold outside. When we took the food back to the hotel the wings had such a strong wiff of the fish sauce. I couldn't stand it and I'm Filipino and we're around it, but not that intense! The main parts of the dish was drowning in the flavors. We were so excited to try this place because of the reviews from Yelp and some of our friends that have been to Portland, but it wasn't all that great.  It was just an okay place to us.

I didn't think that it would be much of a challenge but I was wrong because this place is hopping busy. The tables were full and the take out line was endless. As soon as I took my first bite of pizza I knew why Goomba's is so popular. My husband and I ordered fried mushrooms and a 10 inch pizza with all the toppings. The mushrooms were very good. They came to the table freshly made and with a wonderful horseradish dipping sauce. The pizza blew me away. I didn't expect this little unassuming restaurant to put out such an amazing pizza.

It came with a side of fries that were cold and tasteless. The burgers were hot and taste good but the fries that were served on the side were also cold. The fish sandwich was very good but the best item served  was the chicken sandwich. They marinated a chicken breast and top it  with a pineapple ring, lettuce, tomato and a little teriyaki mayonnaise.

The four were: tofu with chili sauce, eggplant yu xiang, pan fried noodles with vegetables, and dried chicken with chili. We all agreed that all of the dishes were excellent. The pan fried noodle dish was very interesting in appearance, almost like a bird's nest with vegetables in the middle. The vegetables in all dishes were fresh and tasted good.

Chicken is too easy, but I'm definitely glad I got the chicken. It is so worth it.Service was good, long line but there's a seat in the waiting area.

Tonight we tried the Balls on a stick( 3 meatballs) and we chose the Lamb meatballs. We also hide the Baked Mozzerella which is mozzerella bakes with a tasty marinara and served with toast. For dinner we ordered Meatball Smash which is a smashed meatball served on a ciabatta bread and it was served with a house salad, and we ordered the Lasagna Bolognese and added a Chicken Parmesan meatball. The lasagna was quite flavorful and big enough that I'm taking 1/3 of it home for lunch tomorrow. The Meatball Smash was a decent size and also quite tasty. \\nFor dessert, we tried a Cannoli (small and pretty good)and the Mascarpone Impastata which was really really delightful and worth stopping in just for that. \\nWe stopped in tonight as a recommendation from friends/co-workers that live on this side of town. Great recommendation. \\nAfter reading earlier reviews from others, I'm not sure why some were negative unless they were expecting Ritz Carlton service and an expensive environment.

We ordered the chicken Marsala, Buffalo Chicken, Chicken Parmegian, Nona's traditional, sausage, and crab meatballs. Our sides was polenta. Our favorites today were Nonnas Traditional, Chicken Parmigiana and the crab. We will order these three again for sure. The polenta was tasty with a proper consistency. The salad dressing on the Stoppe Salad was a nice Italian perfectly flavored. One of the owners (Isabella ) greeted and served us. Again this is a place we recommend and suggest that you try different meatballs each time you visit. Although next time I see myself ordering just the crab meatballs with a side of pasta.

After maybe 30 minutes of waiting, one said to the other \\"Don't worry, we'll get our food!\\" and the reply was \\"Not if I end up punching someone in the face.\\" That sums up the Life Alive experience pretty well.Pros: Food is tasty, and a full size bowl is big enough that it can serve as two meals. Cons: The wait to order is infuriating- maybe it's supposed to be some sort of crunchy hippie exercise in mindfulness. At the height of dinner rush I saw one of the folks preparing food just standing there because he had nothing to do, so I'm pretty sure the registers are the issue. There are two people taking orders, ringing folks up, and answering phones, so if the phone rings or if someone comes to pick up a to go order, you end up with one person taking orders. As a consequence, there are people who get to the restaurant, see that the line is huge, call in their order from the back of the line, then skip up to the front to pick up their order. This was what prompting the face punching comments from other people in the line. Last time I was there, I had to wait 40 minutes before I even got to place my order. I guess I could call in my order from the back of the line as well so I could get my food faster, but I can't bring myself to do it, so I'll just continue to be a cranky bastard about the whole situation.

Our plan was to sample the new drinks, have a few cocktails and order dinner. Upon arriving, however, we were told there was no room for us to sit down or even order a drink as a large party, unrelated to the so-called soiree, was taking up all the seats. After ridiculously lurking behind several diners, no doubt making their dinner oh so enjoyable, we were finally able to obtain a table for 2...for our party of 8. The drink samples came by in tiny plastic cups filled with about a  1/2 inch of their new martinis (which I do have to admit were quite good). However, after cramming ourselves around our tiny table, little opportunity to order a drink or food presented itself. So in the end, we decided to leave for a friendlier location. I would not be so incensed if we had all happened upon The Lobby by chance and just found it at capacity.

Seriously - we were there at least 4x a month. So, when it was announced that Chef Sewall was not renewing the lease, we were heartbroken. Cut to our first experience at Prairie Fire last night. First off, the place looks completely different. Which is a good thing. To truly succeed in that space, anyone would have had to make it completely their own, lest they run the risk of $1 oysters, amazing wines by the glass, and lobster tacos haunting guests. The new decor is great - modern, warm and inviting. We sat at the bar for dinner, as is tradition in our household and had great, attentive - but not so attentive as to be annoying - service from the friendly bartenders. There were many hits for us with only a few - but very notable - misses. Here's the breakdown of everything we had (we split most everything and were hungry): 1. Wood Fired Oysters with Hollandaise: These were really tasty. Buyer be warned though, there is bacon sprinkled on top of them that is not advertised. For the Prairie Fire purveyors, I need to know when meat is being added to a seemingly non-meat containing dish. -.5 stars. 2. Wood Fired Beans with Mustard Vinaigrette: YES PLEASE. I loved these and will get them every time I come. 3. Squid Ink and Lobster Pasta: Another home run. This was delightful, the pasta was super fresh and the lobster was well cooked. The sauce was also pretty yummy. 4. Cocoa Pasta with Duck Ragu and Jalapeno: This one sounded real weird to me but I wanted to try it. Yes, it is rich and decadent. It is also totally worth it. SO DELICIOUS and definitely not a summertime dish. This made me daydream about snowy weather and a great glass of red wine. ...which leads me to the wines. This, I'm afraid is where  the other -1.5 stars comes from. I don't know if the ghost of Lineage's by the glass wine program is haunting this bar area hard or what but the wines by the glass are a HUGE letdown. We tried three different by the glass options (2 red, 1 white) and none of them were something we would willingly drink again... which is a shame because nothing makes me happier than a great, decadent bowl of pasta and a gorgeous glass of wine.Final verdict - we'll return for the food, for sure. If the wine program gets an overhaul and the pork additions are more clearly advertised, we may even become regulars."},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down the best Italian food in Columbus!!

When we finally talked to one of the ladies working there after 5+ mins, she answered in a way as if we were being impatient and why bugged her.

The facility is beautiful and the seats are comfortable and recline but that is where the good ends.  The bathrooms are disgusting and look like they are never cleaned.  The main floor along all the theaters is sticky.  The service here is horrible.  My friend and I ordered off the 2 to share menu where you can pick an appetizer 2 entrees and 1 dessert.  We ordered the pretzel nuggets with cheese and the nuggets were so greasy the cheese would not stick to them when we dipped them.  We would up rolling each nuggets on a napkin to get off the excess oil and then dipped it in the cheese.  Our entrees arrived and the server was about to leave after dropping off our plates until I asked him to take the empty plates from our appetizer back so we could have room on our trays for the entrees. My friend ordered a burger and she said it was average I ordered the Mac and cheese which was huge and tasty.  Our plates were never picked up by our server.  About an hour into a the movie I hit the button so I could order cookies for our dessert to split.  It took about 25 mins for our server to come to us and then I ordered them.  The cookies never came.  When the bill came it was on the bill though, I asked the server when he dropped the check off if he could take them off the bill since we never actually received them .  He said he would.  We waited another 20 mins and still after no bill arrived I hit the button again.  When our server arrived I asked when do we get the bill and he said they were still working on it.  I guess it is because everyone in the section we were seated was having the same problem.  Some people were brought the wrong food and charged for something else.  Some were charged for food that was never brought like us, and some were brought food they didn't even order .  With this kind of disorder I can see why the final bills take so long to adjust.  Messed up orders seemed to be the trend here as this is all I hear about every time I mention this place to anyone who has been here. Some people in our row opted to wait for the food they ordered which never arrived and were stuck sitting there until the food and bill arrived after the credits rolled for the movie.

We also ordered a Couscous Salad which was huge and packed with fresh vegetables in a mild dressing, wonderful as well. On my return visit I ordered a Lamb Merguez sandwich with the coup of soup. The Merguez sandwich totally rocked over the meatball sandwich I previously had. It was served in the same crispy bun but with a much spicier tomato sauce and green olives on top. I think it will become a favorite. I did see several of their tagine platters being served to other tables and they all looked wonderful. Can't wait to try one of those.

He noticed the next day they charged him $240 and certainly this does not equal 7√ó20.Next they told us no more street parking... ok we can deal with this. Finally, they told us on the phone during the reservation (again my husband was on speaker phone) that they offer a chef's menu or a small plate menu. They asked us to choose for our party of 7 at that time. We had no idea what our party would want so asked if we could decide in real time. They said no problem.Fast forward to the time of the reservation-for some odd reason they put us down for a table or 12. We get the mix up worked out and finally sit down and the waitess doesn't bring us any menus. We query this and she says they have us all down for the chef's menu and that either we all participate or none bc it is an \\"experience\\". Odd.. ok so we decided to do small plates. The waitress seemed a little miffed with our choice. We order our starters and the green beans and iberico were just ok and very small with very sparse flakes of iberico ham. The bread and butter were four basic dinner rolls. The burrata and sweet potato were very good. Next for the main course. I ordered the 8 oz filet. My filet came out and it was no more than 5-6 oz with about two tablespoons of mashed potatos. My husband orded the duck (which is typically served at least somewhat pink) and it was gray all the way through.

I guess some locals feel there are better options these days, and even though there's a Pok Pok in my native NYC I haven't had a chance to go and wanted to try the original. I was surprised there were many other SE Asian specialties there, like Vietnamese/ Burmese. I thought it was just Thai. It is pan regional Thai, from Issan to Bangkok specialties, etc. And the menu is very very extensive - authentic (well, for being run by a white dude), with lots of options to choose from. They give you lime/salted peanuts to try to start; they were not spicy at all.  Since my friend and I had a heavy breakfast, we just split an order of the Fish Wings (spice on the side because my friend is very anti spicy but I really do think most people would have been fine with it, it was very mild). The wings were gooey, sticky, and sweet - it was a really mild Vietnamese style fish sauce (vs the salty Thai kind) I felt. We also shared an order of delicate and delicious khao soi - crispy noodles in a fragrant coconut curry. It was served with bone in chicken thigh and drumstick. The chicken was tender and cooked down, but if it was prepared without bone that would have been a better easy/sharing experience. Great, chewy, egg noodles. The curry was what was most delicious. Our server was nice, knowledgeable. He also understood we had a heavy breakfast and was ok with us not ordering more food. The portions are decent here, esp the wings and the food is inexpensive I feel. Maybe it's cause I'm from NYC :D Would recommend for authentic Thai food lovers, and for first timers. Decor, ambiance is no frills and overall vibe is relaxed. It seems good for groups or  a foodie date - seems like they can make stiff drinks."},{"name":"Vivo Austin","address":"6406 N I 35, Ste 2343","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Came here for a great time with my brothers.

Uh huh!Why should you come here for happy even with mediocre service, the wine! $6.50 for 6 ounce, even though the menu says $6, and it used to be $5.50.  The Red is especially made for Anatoli by Three Sisters Winery, and it's a fantastic Meritage! If you are a wine person than you would know it's hard to find happy wine that isn't terrible. Calamari here is very tasty and fresh. Lightly battered and crispy, yet not greasy at all. Their tzatziki is very good, although a little runny the flavor is pretty much perfect.

We got a variety of oysters, asking to be sure we didn't get any briny ones.  My favorite was the Wellfleet, good amount of sweet and salty without the brine.  The house Island Creek were decent, and the Ichabod Flats were pretty salty, even for my taste.For the entree, we got the lobster roe noodles and the clam chowder.  The clam chowder was fantastic, more seafood than potatoes which I always appreciate.  Most restaurants seem to struggle getting a better flavor than a Progresso can of soup, but Island Creek managed to provide a bowl that was flavorful and unique.  The lobster roe noodles had a wonderful cream sauce, plenty of lob tail and meat.  I wanted to lick the bowl on this one.  My main critique is the price, but I assume that's a downtown Boston tax.

And to be honest, I'd consider this a rundown shopping center, as most of the business have vacated over the years. Though I have no clue why they chose this long forgotten shopping center, I am happy that they did! The area has seen a slow revival over the years. Whoever owns the shopping center is trying to rebrand the old Lincoln Village shopping center as \\"The Linc,\\" though the old sign is still clearly seen. I am hoping whatever they are doing to revive it will work. When I stepped out of the car I was immediately hit with memories of walking to this shopping center to see movies like Titanic and one of those Friday movies at the old Lincoln Village movie theater (now where they have the Blue Genie Art Bazaar). Or that time I looked for prom dresses here. WEIRD! All gone.Located on the side facing Highland Mall blvd/Middle Fiskville Road (cannot be seen from IH 35), neighboring Men's Warehouse is the new Vivo! We decided to try it for lunch, and I was surprised the see the place was quite busy. While I was not a fan of the close seating where we were sat, I understand they have to do what they have to do with the small space provided. Though I find this close kind of seating to be less private (if you're wanting to go here for a date). As the old Vivo was, the new location is wall to wall red, with interesting art on the walls. The music was fitting (Spanish), and we were brought a plethora of salsa which we devoured. I dig the salsa and the puffy corn chips. Sunday and Mondays they have brunch oddly enough. They also offer a lunch menu (all options under $10) which I decided to give a shot. My plate came with one enchilada, one puffy taco served with brown rice and refried beans. My plate was delicious, and hit the spot. Those puffy tacos are just as good as I remember. I can't wait to come back for dinner and get one of their cucumber margaritas.

The atmosphere is aesthetically pleasing, seems like they're trying in that regard.A \\"please wait to be seated\\" sign greets you, but the hostess is multi tasking so it took some time for her to show.Outside tables include an attractive center heating element, but two issues: (1) only the manager is authorized or capable of turning it on, it took her 15 minutes to finally show up (2) she had difficulty with multiple tables (one failed to work.). Time to train others.The Food\\nI gravitate toward Cubano's, here they borrowed the name, but failed to capture the essence of this great sandwich.  Most significantly, the bread isn't pressed.  They use a very hearty Pork Belly, but it tastes faux like what is served at Arby's.Mac & Cheese - ample portion, but didn't look like my friend was impressed by it.Steak Salad - we ate the few pieces of protein and left about 75% of the low quality greens and veggies.* the condiment selection is often telling, here they opted for cheap Hunt's ketchup: get off the dime and offer Heinz, or better yet, Portland Ketchup.  And then there's French's Mustard: looks like they shop at Winco.Like many Yelpers have stated, the food just isn't very good.  Conversely, the best Chile Relleno is down the street at a large Mexican market, as is one of the better breakfast burritos at a cart.Including two ciders and it's a $75 outing for four before tip; for that coin we can Uber it into inner Portland for a much better quality and value experience.They should do okay with the golf and tennis crowd, but probably won't draw too many outside of that."},{"name":"Cuba 512","address":"6800 West Gate Blvd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The worst chicken fingers!

The only problem is if you do that you don't get to have left overs the next day.  Great dining experience.  We came back the following weekend to try a few more things.  The second time we had to get the Ropa Vieja again just because it was so amazing but we also tried the weekend special which is an Oxtail plate which was also amazing, very tender with a deep burgundy sauce and yet another huge portion.

The lighting is intimate but you can still read the menus, the architecture is stunning, and noise level is bustling without being overbearing.  Scoring a table here can be difficult on a Friday or Saturday night but generally it's not packed to the gills and is still comfortable.  Now on to the important stuff: drinks and music.  Drinks are good, albeit on the pricey side, and generally the service is pretty decent.  The sangria isn't the best I've ever had, but still plenty delicious!  The live flamenco/spanish guitar performances here though are what makes this place stand out.  I take everyone here I know when they come to town, and it's always a winner.

When we pulled up to this place, we didn't know what to think because it was in this nondescript shopping center. OK, I'll pause right here, catch my breath, and then tell you that this was quite possibly the best Thai I've ever had. Hubs ordered a seafood wonton soup, I ordered my usual seafood Tom Yum, and a crazy good basil Thai seafood fried rice (if you hadn't already noticed, we enjoy seafood). All very tasty, and one big key for me was that I didn't need one single condiment to augment any of it, it was that good. Don't be fooled by the shopping center it's in or the modest decor (not at all a dump whatsoever, just nothing that screams AMAZING FOOD), their food is fresh, well seasoned, and super tasty.

Architecturally I have to say the restaurant is designed beautifully the decor gives you an air of a relaxing casual luxuary while the wood and warmth of the colors give you a relaxed laid-back feeling.  The outside gives off a  european vibe of spain mixed with a hint of a moulin rouge atmosphere as though you are entering someplace tastefully entertaining.  Unfortunately there were no performances going on when I visited Ceviche, but I immediately I  got a sense for how debonair a night with performers could really be. The lighting was perfectly dim for a night of romantic conversation, so if your looking for the perfect date night restaurant or to impress that special someone this place is it! The menu was very bold, edgy, and different. Ranging from ceviche, to tapas , steak , to fish all very enticing options. I settled for the \\"Ceviche a la Ruso\\" which was absolutely amazing seasoned perfectly you could really taste every flavor in that Ceviche and it went perfectly with the oysters. I wouldn't leave the restaurant without trying it! I also ordered \\"Pulpo a la gallena\\" which didn't meet the standards of the ceviche but still definitely worth a try. I do have to add as a young college student I would have loved to have enjoyed one of their signature sangrias to go along with the meal, personally as a young adult  21 being the drinking age seems like a violation of the pursuit of happiness to me which is unconstitutional. As adults we should all have the right to kick back and enjoy a cup of wine, but enough politics Ceviche really is a great place and the food is wonderful the whole night will be an experience of the highest caliber.

I ordered a black bean burger wrap- its nice that they have a wrap option for a healthier side but the black bean burger needs some basic salt and flavor- it taste more like mashed black beans than a true burger. The rest of the wrap was pretty mediocre- I was able to eat it as I was hungry but not working getting again especially with so many better options. I could have let that slide but the service was subpar. I had an empty glass of water after 30 minutes of getting there but the waiter never came by and filled it up even though it was about 80 degrees and we were sitting outside. It took him a while to serve our drinks and then we literally waited for 30 minutes to get our check; even at that, we had to flag him down and all three of us were wondering if he just forgot about us!

Is the bubble tea at ViVi out of this world? Nahhhhh. But I think this is a fun place to go for the experience. ViVi is a very girly and kawaii spot--a perfect girl's day out spot--you don't really see much of anywhere else in ATL. The pink and white themed decorations, the princess chairs, a cute little swing at the front of the teahouse--the place is a lot of fun! And I factor these aspects into my review of ViVi. [FOOD]\\nViVi's got a wide selection of bubble teas and they offer a few unique items no other tea house has to offer. I feel like all girls were obsessed with mason jars in 2016 and that obsession continues into the new year. ViVi's got this cool bubble tea in a mason jar item plus cotton candy; you can order this for around $7. The cotton candy bubble tea series comes in four flavors: green tea, regular milk tea, taro and tiramisu. I got the green tea flavored cotton candy milk tea and I loved it! Now, don't think this is going to be super sweet. This mix actually was less sweet than my regular bubble tea from ViVi. This is because they factor in the extra sweetness of the cotton candy when making this drink. There's only about 50% sugar in the actual milk tea and you're supposed to stuff the cotton candy into the mason jar, and pour the extra mini jar of tea on top. This will create a perfect blend of tea and cotton candy sweetness. Very cool and unique idea. I also ordered the classic light bulb boba, which is earl grey milk tea with sweet honey boba. The flavor isn't very strong but you can definitely taste the delightful earl grey flavor. There's definitely a ton of sugar in this drink but which bubble tea isn't infused with an overabundance of sugar? I'm alright with it. Plus, you get a cool light bulb to drink out of!

Healthy options, filling portions, great atmosphere. But the last few times I've gone to this location, the food and service have been disappointing. Food: I always order the Chicken Pita with the Kale Salad as a side. The first time I had the pita, it was one of the best chicken pita wraps I had ever eaten. I actually said that to the waiter when I had finished. That was my regular order every time I went. But the last 3 times I've gone in (2 times dine-in, 1 time to-go), it's been disappointing. The pita was extremely tough and dry. The chicken was a small portion and also very dry. As a contrast, I went to the newly opened True Food in the Domain just last week and had their Chicken Pita to go for lunch. It was absolutely fantastic, just like I remembered it. So it must be something with this location.Service: This place gets extremely busy at lunch time. But the last couple times I've dined in, it's been hard to flag down our waiter. I'm not sure if they're understaffed or what. This last time, my dining companion had to wave at least 3 times before someone came over to our table. My first few times going, the service was very attentive. So this has also gone down hill.Atmosphere: The restaurant is very bright, open, and clean. Bathrooms are as well. They have an open kitchen and you can watch the prep cooks prepare vegetables at the counters on the edge of the dining area. One bad thing is it gets extremely noisy at the peak of the lunch rush. Many times, my dining companions and I are almost yelling at each other to be heard.Parking: Very bad. Try not to park in the garage!! The rate is $6/hour. You can get validation for the first hour. I'm fine with paying for parking and understand the garage has to balance supply and demand when you have many popular venues in the shopping center. However, I cannot remember a time that I have parked in the garage and not had an issue with the exit gates. I almost always get stuck there (either myself or behind someone else) because the machine is having issues processing payment. To me, if you're going to charge for parking, you should at least ensure the gates work properly. Additionally, watch out for designated spots close to the elevator for EV parking. If there's going to be signage, it should not be 10 feet off the ground in an unlit part of the garage. I unfortunately did not see the sign until it was too late and was given a $75 ticket. I was unable to see the signs from my car and had to step out and look up in order to see it. Beware!Had you asked me a couple months ago how I would rate this place, it would have been 5 stars - no questions asked. But there's just too many things that consistently go wrong and make my experience unpleasant that I can only give 2 stars. Minus 2 stars for the food. Minus 1 star for the service. I know True Food doesn't have much control over the garage so I won't minus a star for that, but it does take away from the overall experience."},{"name":"Suzette Creperie","address":"3342 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"A perfect light lunch in a very cozy and European setting.She had the asparagus crepe and I did abuild your own with smoked salmon, caramelized onions, capers, and spinach.

Service was excellent and super friendly, and it was really nice to see the chef cooking our food.We got the fried calamari as an appetizer and it was probably one of the best plates of calamari I've ever had. The breading was just right - usually I find that there is way too much breading relative to calamari. It came with a slice of lemon and the sever recommended dipping the calamari in the red (?) vinegar that was placed on every table with other condiments. The acidity really balanced out the fried taste of the dish - highly recommended!We next got the squid ink (black) pasta with aglio olio - ground squid with garlic. To be honest, I didn't taste too much of a difference between squid ink pasta and regular pasta however it was cooked perfectly al dente and the ground squid with all of the garlic really gave a nice flavorful punch to the dish.

Unfortunately, I think the quality of the food here has trended downward over the last 2-3 years. What was once one of my favorite sushi buffets is now becoming simply mediocre.The restaurant is cutting costs and it shows. Only the cheapest fish are used for sushi (e.g. tuna, salmon, yellowtail). No longer can we use tongs to grab several slices of sashimi. Instead, sashimi is served on tiny plates, one slice per plate. Oysters are limited to three per plate, snow crab legs five per plate. I can't blame them for that -- offering oysters and snow crab legs on a buffet is costly. However, the snow crab legs have very little meat and the oysters are small.Admittedly, prices have remained the same over the years: about $20+ for lunch and $30+ for dinner per person. They haven't made any adjustments for increased food or operational costs (if any), or inflation. Dinner is the best time to go because there are more dishes.At the aforementioned prices, Nori Nori was a solid value. Today, I'm not so sure. The sushi rice is bad and that's a problem. It's approaching, dare I say, Ru San's level sushi rice. Dense, hard, chewy. The unagi isn't as good as it used to be. It's got a pasty, unappetizing consistency.The sushi is sufficiently fresh. There are rolls aplenty, colorful and pleasing to the eye. I'm not a roll person and prefer traditional nigiri (fish over rice) and sashimi (slices of raw fish). The nigiri selection is average. The tobiko (flying fish roe) wrapped in seaweed is probably my favorite of the nigiri.The salads and cooked foods are so-so. I've always liked the seaweed salad and still do. The hijiki (Asian brown sea vegetable) salad is good too. Mussels are a win and the beef tataki, salmon tataki (in cilantro sauce), and izumidai (Japanese snapper) with tomato are fine as well. Examples of cooked foods include yakisoba noodles, Korean BBQ beef short ribs, salmon collar, and breaded shrimp.The \\"robata\\" grill and crepe station are still going strong. You can get made-to-order food at the robata grill such as a bowl of udon noodles. The crepes are still on point. The fruits are ripe. Strawberry, blueberry, banana, and more. Chocolate, whipped cream, customize it however you want. Other desserts include sliced fruit, yogurt, jello, and cookies.There's a soft serve ice cream machine located in front of the crepe station. It's got two flavors, vanilla and green tea. I like them both, though fair warning: the green tea ice cream isn't super sweet and has a slightly bitter finish.Service is great. The restaurant is popular, especially on weekends, and they are adequately staffed to handle the demand. Reservations are only accepted for parties of 10 or more. Parties of 60 or more are eligible for a group discount.Bottom line: Nori Nori still has one of the best sushi buffets in Atlanta.

All the pasta (except the penne) are homemade and you can tell, perfect consistency, perfect flavor and just the right amount of Al dente. He loved it!I ordered veal moretti which was two giant cutlets on top of the fettuccine with an amazing cream sauce. TO. DIE. FOR. The breaded veal was crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside. Even reheated the following day which I had to do because the portion is gigantic. I would highly recommend this dish.Aside from the crappy table we were at, I can't say enough about how good the food and the service was at Morettis. Yum... can't wait to go back."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've been coming to Piazza Italia randomly for about 8 years.  I finally took my wife here this weekend as I realized I had been a bad husband by depriving her of the best Italian in Portland.  They always have fresh pappardelle pasta and one other fresh pasta of the day which you can sub into any dish.  I wish more Italian restaurants had fresh pasta.  The sauces are amazing here too.  I almost always get the pappardelle with wild boar.  It'll change your life.  Most pasta dishes are in the $15 range which is really reasonable for good PDX food.This is a hometown feel of Italy type of restaurant.  They've got a deli counter and soccer scarves repping AS Roma all over the place.  It's the epitome of Italian family dining like real Italians do...not like other Italian restaurants that shall not be named.

It is also equipped with both indoor and outside seating - a cute little yard outside that is perfect for a cool morning.I heard great things about the honey nut latte - my boyfriend said he read endless reviews about it on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. I would say it's a really good flavor - one of the best I've tried - but it was just a bit too strong and sweet for me. I came back again and opted for just a regular unflavored latte and was much more satisfied.I have yet to try their food - and I can't speak for their latte art because I was given my orders in to go cups. But the coffee is pretty good - not too strong of a flavor but smooth and satisfying.The one complaint I would have is that the music is always really loud. Sure, there is a lot of seating, so you might think you can sit and get some work done, but I just can't concentrate here. Thunderbird is definitely not the quiet, calming atmosphere you may look for in a coffee shop.Not my favorite in Austin but definitely a great place to get good espresso drinks."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Yes, aptly named. \\"Pok Pok\\" is the sound it made coming out the other end."},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Cold food..

I might have found the place for you: Laughing Planet where you can be surrounded be dinosaurs and exotic plants.  OK, the dinosaurs are plastic (but cute) and there are plants (healthy plants are exotic to me because I tend to have a black thumb), so since this isn't Jurassic World, the real attraction here is food and service.I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door (I was later greeted by the manager and thanked for coming in).  The very personable counter-person gave me a hand-held printed menu so I could step off to the side to make my choice while he finished helping the person ahead of me.  I thought this was a bright thing to do which made both of us customers feel like we have both been appropriately served.  When it was my turn, I ordered the grilled chicken burrito with sour cream and guacamole on the side and a glass of iced tea.  There is a charge for the guacamole and sour cream of $2.50 which kind of surprised me, but in the end I was glad I had ponied up for both.  I took a number and seated myself.  My burrito and iced tea were brought to me.  The burrito was huge, and when they say to peel down the foil encasing it and take a few bites at a time, they are right.  If you don' follow the instructions, it will collapse and fall apart all over your hands.  There was a lot of grilled organic chicken in the burrito along with beans (which were absolutely correctly cooked) and had great flavor.  A young woman counter-person stopped by table and asked me if I wanted some salsa and I asked for and got mild green salsa.  This and the sour cream and guacamole gave a wonderful kind of subtle fruity yet spicy flavor plus those three ingredients helped make the burrito a little easier to eat because it was overall somewhat dry.  The iced tea had great flavor and made the hot day fade away.  I like Hungry Planet's emphasis on organic and healthy ingredients and good meat products (such as grass-fed beef).  I loved the dinosaurs and overall modern decor.  I most definitely will return to try some of their other tasty-sounding dishes."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is awesome!!

Where to begin...For the past three weeks, there has been a terrible smell inside. It smells like someone puked on the floor, which was then cleaned up with week-old mop water. Seriously, can you guys not smell that?I've ordered food twice in my last three visits and both times, it was either undercooked, served room temperature, or just plain bad.The one saving grace was the Dark and Stormy. Alas, I ordered a D&S yesterday and it was terrible. I left the glass 75% full and just left. Perhaps for the last time.I know restaurant owners hate Yelp and hate negative reviews like this. But if you're reading this, know that I was one of your regulars. And now I'm not. And that has nothing to do with Yelp.My only guess is that the restaurant is under new management and/or ownership.

My tongue was lifted gently into the air and taken on a magic carpet ride through a citrus sky. I've had lemon ricotta pancakes before that were much too heavy and I could only stomach a few bites, but I was pretty close to stealing the other half of this plate from the friend I was sharing with. We also split a savory dish, the Corned Beef Hash. The hash was crispy, the eggs perfectly runny, but not as divine as the pancakes. Among our table of 6 we split a Cookie Monster French Toast, which I believe only a true sweet-fanged monster would be able to finish alone. The other dishes were more typical of what I'd expect from your local brunch spot, but seasonal specials like the Lobster Benedict might entice you to come. Yes, it's extremely crowded in here. The host was very polite and checked in with us frequently during our wait, and I was surprised that we got our water refilled pretty regularly given the number of people the staff had to attend to.

Definitely not awful, but were hoping for more.My husband and I had heard good things about this place and went in for Valentine's Day. We saw at the bar and ordered a dozen oysters and shrimp cocktail to start. The oysters were great! The cocktail shrimp were very small and had no flavor, to be honest. For our meals: he got some sort of lobster pasta (which he said was good) and I got the salmon. Now I know it was a busy night, but it took FOREVER for our meals to come out. We weren't in a rush, but we were really hungry! When the salmon came out, the salmon and polenta cake were hot but the veggies were ice cold; and the salmon was overcooked. I had ordered it medium-rare, and it came out well. Taste-wise it was nothing to write home about, but was OK. I was so hungry at that point that I didn't want to wait for a new one, so I ate it and didn't complain - but at a nice seafood restaurant it's a little off-putting that nobody in the kitchen, or the person running the food, noticed and corrected it before it came out.One other thing kind of rubbed me the wrong way....before our meals came out and the bartender was clearing our appetizer plates, I asked him if he would mind taking a photo of us. He said, \\"umm, yeah, let me do one thing and I'll come right back.\\" He walked away and refilled some water glasses, wiped down the bar....and never came back to take the photo. I know it's not a big deal at all and I totally understand that he's working and he has better things to do than take a photo, but...it was Valentine's Day (our first Valentine's Day married), and I just felt as if he should have maybe taken the extra five seconds to snap a photo of us. If you want to roll your eyes about it behind our backs afterwards that's totally fine with me! But to just not do it? I don't know. It was just disappointing.For a $200 dinner, I'd expect them to nail it - and they didn't.

Love the steamed crab legs.  They are meaty and of good quality.  It's a fan favorite as all crab lovers gather in line for them.  They also have an assortment of sushi rolls, sashimi, and nigiris available.  Their hot line is good too.  My go to items are the tempura, gyozas, and the shumai dumplings, and wings.

Caf√© Luna's vibe is one most restaurants strive for: BUSTLING and clearly at their peak when I went for brunch with my mom around 11am on a Saturday. I ordered my usual brunch meal: French Toast. I like my French toast soft, but not runny, not over cooked/burnt, but not undercooked and too gooey in consistency. Caf√© Luna's was just how I like it! I've decided this French toast is one of my favorites I've had in Boston thus far, the cinnamon bread really adds a sweetness and flavor to an otherwise simplistic dish. Although only simplistic because I chose it that way...Caf√© Luna also offers French toast with various forms of fruit, nuts, and chocolate.

Never having tried Moroccan food before, I noticed that there aren't a lot of opportunities to try it in my home state or during my travels. The lunch menu starts off with two different types of soups, and they also do a beautiful arrangement of Moroccan tea. Each different entree curry can be paired with cuscus or a flat bread. I had the chicken and olive curry, with a flat bread. One of the most uncommon blend of spices, and a particular texture of flat bread. The olives made the curry a little too salty for my taste. The chicken was so tender, and portion sizes are great for downtown Portland.A really unique experience, trying affordable Moroccan food for the first time.

Next time, I will probably order deliver or pick-up. I came with a party of 7 and was told there was a 20 min wait. However, the wait ended up being a hour, which is why I'm not giving this place a five star. Parties of 2-4 got in pretty fast, and many small parties who were behind us got in before us. After they let in a significant amount of smaller parties, they waited for two consecutive smaller parties to finish, before merging the table for us, which was probably why the wait was longer.

Now, I'm a 100% meat eating machine and not one to dispose of food easily, unless it's really awful so, I started sampling the meal. The food was really tasty, I particularly enjoyed the creamy baba ghanouj, it was the first time that I ate eggplant without a funny look on my face.

Where is that Cha-Ching sound coming from??  $2.00 for a drink when a single taco is $3.50? Water for everyone! We sat and waited. Maybe it took so long so that you could enjoy the music (which I did) or so the kids could finish coloring (which they did), or maybe they needed more than 6 people cooking back there. I guess we kept them busy with our massive order of three tacos and chicken strips.I got what they called the Democrat. I will from here on out refer to it as tasteless waste of calories. It looked like it would taste good...it had no taste at all! The rice...they should have asked Uncle Ben for some help.

We had numerous people come to our table to bring food and drinks and check on us, but it wasn't over done.  My biggest complaint was that for everything that they brought to our table, not one person took things away.  So our small plates and empty glasses were literally piled up on our small table.  It was weird!  It became a joke between my date and I as to whether they would notice that we had empty plates that needed to be cleared. Nope!The drinks were hit and miss.  Everyone is trying to out-do each other these days with inventive drink menus-this place included.  The Gibson and Derby were great!  Very flavorful and not too complex. The Gin and Tonic was tasteless, literally.  We also had the Blood and Sand which was not great either.  it was cherry flavored and medicinal tasting.  Part of the problem with the drinks is they put too many ice cubes in the drinks which watered them down.  I transferred most of the ice cubes in my water glass which helped.The food was hit and miss as well.  I had the burger which I asked for medium-rare.  It was seared on the outside and literally kicking on the inside.  Like steak tartare.  Cold inside.  I ate it anyway and the flavors were good.  It would be a \\"must order\\" if it was cooked properly.  It is about the size of a large slider.  The salad was basic and a bit overdressed with the salad dressing.

It looked like someone ran to McDonalds and placed a half order of dollar menu sausage on a plate - they tried to charge us $3 for what they called \\"link sausage\\". I ordered the monte cristo sandwich I always order and my boyfriend ordered an omelette, both came with \\"home fries\\" ... all was borderline inedible and I would say 80% of our meals we're originally frozen food..not fresh...the home fries were not potatoes, everything was heavily processed, and they didn't even put monte cristo sauce on my sandwich - so sad, so depressing. They're clearly cutting as many corners as possible to increase profit margin and they're going to lose all of their customers (as they clearly already have from how empty it was in there and other recent reviews). Also the coffee used to be good...now it's as good as everything else they serve. Cliff notes: they're serving you frozen food and overcharging you for it.

Through my multiple experiences at your restaurants I have always left with a good feeling, and my stomach would agree. This past Saturday I must say would be the best of those experiences.The restaurant was indeed properly lit and the atmosphere was ambient as we were greeted by the initial host who warmly received us and escorted us to our table.  I must recommend making a reservation, though my company and I were promptly seated, Mitchell's has such a reputation around the community of being the gold standard for service and food that one can imagine how they have limited availability on a weekend evening.This evening exceed even my highest expectations. From the appetizer crab cake, to my entree that was a 16 ounce prime ribeye, which was recommend from our waitress to compliment it with cognac peppercorn sauce. What a great thing to recommended. Temperature and spice was perfect! Our waitress, Kelsey was awesome and such a delight. Her positive attitude and sincere warm smiles truly made our night.

Bad service. And just bad service! Came here for a birthday party. Two members of our group got their food 50 minutes after the whole table got theirs. While they were waiting, they were told their food was given to another table. This happened twice to the same people! They didn't have anything to eat or drink...not even water. Waitress said she would talk to the manager to see what she could do.After clearing up half our table, we were told we look tired so we must be ready for our bill. Really?! The two people who got their food late asked what had come out of the whole pizza-manager ordeal. Waitress told us, \\"Well I can remove your pizza, but you got your food and you ate it so you should pay for it.\\" Then she walked away. Called the  manager and she was nice enough to remove the charge. BUT we were also nice enough not to single out the member of her staff who was so rude! Go for the beer and music. Don't go if you want a great meal. Food was not worth it at all. The cherry on the sundae? We were there for almost 3 hours and two other friends never got their food. NEVER. Maybe if they numbered their tables and had those numbers on the orders, there wouldn't be so much chaos.

Island Creek has all of these things, and is one of my Top 5 favorite restaurants. When I lived in Boston for 3 years, I frequented this spot. Every visitor that came into town had a stop here. I've eaten here over 30 times and most recently on a vacation to the city we came back. It was better than ever. Island Creek Oyster Bar, I love you. Here are the reasons why.COCKTAILS:\\nThere is an inventive cocktail menu and the bartenders know their stuff. The restaurant gets very full, so for those silly nights without a reservation you can post up at the bar and take your pick. My most recent favorite was a spicy tequila and cucumber cocktail. There is also a nice wine list and beer selection, too. The servers will happily pair wine for you with your meal.\\nOYSTERS:\\nReally I mean their name is Island Creek Oyster and these peeps take it above and beyond. The owner actually cultivated his own way of farmer oysters and thus this name is born! They are high-salt, juicy with a fruity finish. \\nWhen in New England the world is your oyster, as you can't go wrong with the variety of East Coast oysters available here.FOOD:\\nOk, so I don't like to order the same thing at restaurants because I love to try new things. Only certain dishes stop me in my tracks and become my staple order. Lobster Roe noodles at ICOB is one of those dishes. This is a must order.Pasta made exquisite with lobster Roe, braised beef, butter poached lobster, parm and for good measure something green. Goddamn. This dish is perfection. While the lobster Roe noodles definitely rank top of my list here at ICOB, the rest of the menu is spectacular too. Their menu is fun- they have printed items that are there all the time and then hand written specials that pop up. I recommend trying the specials as they are always fresh and delicious. Recently we tried the bass collar on special and it was so flavorful. Other menu highlights include:\\n- Crudos: super fresh! My fave is the salmon.\\n- hot biscuit: flaky and covered in honey. I meannnn....\\n- fried oyster slider: tiny but mighty. These are divine.\\n- scallops: I've never ordered them, but tablemates of mine still talk about the scallops 3 years later.Honestly, I don't think you could go wrong at this fantastic spot.

For two non-yelpers they usually have some solid recommendations and with this place they didn't disappoint.We came here on a Sunday, yes, this past freezing Sunday of the Arctic Freezing Blast. They don't take reservations so we arrived around 7PM. We were seated at about 7:45. I did have a moment of apprehension when I thought we would be seated outside but luckily we weren't. I could see sitting outside being enjoyable on warm lazy days but not on this particular evening. Our table ordered a variety of entrees including the half bbq chicken, chicken-fried steak, buffalo meatloaf, and the green chile mac and cheese. We also had the artichoke dip as a starter. They give you popcorn to start and jalapeno cornbread muffins during your meal. All of the food was great and the portions were HUGE! No one complained about the taste or size of their meal. The only complaint going around was that the entrees were so large that eating them became monotonous. We remedied this by sharing our entrees around the table. I had the chicken-fried steak and I swapped out the veggies so I could pick two sides rather than one. I had the mac and cheese and the green chile grits. The grits were amazing! They had a nice spicy kick and smooth texture and were my favorite side by far. The chicken-fried steak had a bite to it and the gravy was amazing. The steak itself was well-cooked and crispy and monstrously large. Our server was attentive and almost seemed psychic. He was on top of keeping our glasses filled and replenishing the cornbread. In addition he even told us a fun tidbit about the restaurant. Apparently it's one of the last Sunday Houses left in Austin! When we clearly had no clue what a Sunday House was he explained it to us. Apparently back in the day when the farmers came in from making deliveries on Saturday night they would stay Sunday night in the city in order to go to Church in the morning. He also explain that there were two levels to a Sunday House to keep genders from mixing. You learn something new every day!Apparently this place makes some strong killer drinks.

It's some kind of pan seared and under-seasoned catfish (apparently the server's fav...God knows why) resting on rice noodles which are swimming in grease.  The noodles kind of resembled baby food.  Once you put them in your mouth you were dually fighting both the gritty mushy crumbling of over cooked rice along with the bubble of grease that was sloshing around in their and then eventually coating your stomach.  Fortunately for me, I took one bite of the noodles and then let them be.  Later, I survived the evening with merely gas, bloating and general indigestion.  My partner, who was not so lucky, had more than a few bites.  The revelation of the grease as we were eating told us that perhaps this was not the much talked about cuisine we were expecting.  We explained the grease situation to the waitress (who had previously been quite nice to us) and were confronted with a curt \\"It's supposed to be like that.  Would you like your check?\\"  Well, yes, I guess we would...thanks.The next day, we called the manager to explain the bout with food poisoning that was endured.  He tactfully gave us the run around by saying there was no way he could know if we were food poisoned by his restaurant because of blah blah blah.  He then suggested we call some kind of food and health thingy to assess what exactly gave us food poisoning.  I explained that she barfed up little puddles of Pok Pok grease (literally...they were floating around in the toilet), but he remained unconvinced.  Oh well.In addition to the food poisoning, overall everything we had was highly unimpressive.  The chicken wings, also recommended by our server, were ridiculously overflavoured.  I felt like I was eating a brown sugared lollipop of a chicken wing.  The sweetness was overwhelming.  We also had the soup, which did not have an offensive flavor profile by any means, but it was just boring and also overly greasy.Did I mention the drinks?

My partner had a Kirin and the poke bowl. Our food was good - the broth in the Tokyo ramen was light and rich with katsuo dashi. It's one of the few broths I've had in Portland which was not only delicious, but also not too salty. On the other hand, the service was mediocre, which just doesn't work for a Japanese izakaya. Our server was also fairly condescending when we asked about the ramen not coming out (almost 20 minutes had passed after the poke came). He excused the delay by the fact that izakayas serve food as it is ready. That is true, but I also know from experience in Japan that ramen doesn't take much time to prep either, especially given the emptiness of the place at 9pm. He could have just said he'd go check on it without giving us a lecture. Unfortunately, given the plethora of other places that serve great food AND have good service, I don't think I'll be back, but that ramen (once we got it) was still quite good."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great Brunch on Sunday. Food is excellent and service is great."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I have to say I had a mediocre brunch there a couple of months ago. I\\"m not saying don't go, but I do feel compelled to share my experience. I really liked my Bloody Mary but there was a problem with my order that went unresolved. I ordered the Egg White Frittata, in which I asked them to put one or two yolks (which is neither here nor there, I just wanted to let you know it could be done). When the dish arrived, however, it was unbelievably salty. I'm not saying there was a little salt and I'm salt-sensitive or anything like that; it was so salty it made my mouth pucker. Something was wrong with that dish. The server, when she finally checked in with us, went to fetch me a new dish right away (I'll return to that in a minute), but you can guess how the second dish was seasoned. It came back with zero salt in it at all. It was like that line from Top Chef when Ash said, \\"Oh, I forgot to add flavor!\\"  I wish wish wish someone in the kitchen had tasted the dish that was returned. if they had and if they didn't have some sort of taste bud disability, they would have understood how it needed to be fixed  and not simply made me a new one at the opposite end of the salt spectrum. Ultimately my reaction to my overly salty then overly bland dish turned became \\"Whatever, I'm hungry, I'll eat it.\\"Additionally, I'm not crazy about Island Creek's multi-server concept because that was part of the problem.  Because there was not one person designated to our table, the egg situation was not addressed for about 10 minutes, which is an eternity in restaurant patron time.  We asked one person about the dish who said she'd send a server over, and no one came. When we asked a different server, word got out that I'd sent my dish back and then we got about four people checking in with us. Despite all this attention, I still don't feel that I was actually being listened to.In short, MY brunch experience seemed disorganized. Everyone was very nice there and my three friends enjoyed their dishes very much.  Despite all this and because my friends liked everything they had, I would definitely go back to try it again."},{"name":"The Stranded Sailor Pub","address":"418 Sanford Ave","city":"Sanford","stars":"5","text":"Local pub that is half American dive bar.

The prawns were extremely fresh and sweet, but the texture of raw shrimp is just not to my taste - too slimy.  Also had a taste of their potato and leek soup, drizzled with truffle oil and garnished with bacon bits.  Quite rich and tasty and the truffle essence smelled divine.  For the main, we split the full order of the linguine boscaiola - cognac & truffle cream sauce (I love my truffles - instant flavour upgrade!) with a ground beef (not so tasty - I ended up pushing this into a little pile on the side of the plate).  Onto the highlight of my evening there, the dessert!  A lovely deeply espresso flavoured creme brulee, served with coffee jelly and condensed milk that was somehow browned or caramelized.

They charge $28.00 for self parking and you will be lucky to find a parking spot within a 1/4 of a mile of the hotel. They also do not have self park handicap parking here and they only have valet handicap parking so you are forced to tip I guess because that is your only option. They charge you a resort fee and you will be lucky to find a chair by the pool and here is another kicker, they only allow you two tubes per room and if you want anymore than that you need to pay $10.00 a tube, when was the last tine you came to a family resort with two people??? Breakfast for adults is $30.00 per adult and $14.00 per child which is outrageous! Let's get back to the chairs and I actually heard this from people sitting next to me. They were not even guests of the hotel and he said to his friend \\"I come here on the Weekends with my family and just pay for parking which you can do at the gates and spend the day for $28.00\\"! He had a cooler and makes up a name and room number for his two tubes because all they do is write it down an a clipboard and once you leave they will never see you again and then buys the other two on his credit card. There are no wristbands here to verify you are staying here nor any towel cards so once you pay for parking you are all good. I am sure many people do this because this pool is PACKED!

In the meantime, they give you a small plate of peanuts which has pieces of lemongrass and other spices I couldn't quite identify. Not to mention they infuse their water with a ingredient that tastes similar to rice. Different. And I like it!Surprise, surprise... I ordered the Fish Sauce Wings. At $15, probably the most amount of money I've ever spent on chicken wings. But let me tell you, it was worth every. single. cent. Those bad boys were sticky-finger-licking good and packed full of flavor. Fish sauce, you have never tasted so good.

They make coffee that MATTERS. Their most notable coffee is their *Freakin Yum*, a blend with soft and gentle notes. They had a rotation of seasonal blends as drip coffee on my particular visit. Most of their coffee, in general, seemed to lean on the gentle side. For instance, the *Tanzania* drip (self-serve) had notes of white rose, guava, and sweet cream -- a taste that most people, even non-coffee snobs, could enjoy.

Actually, they were out of a few things that night, as we found out when we overheard the servers tell other tables that they were out of several of their meatballs. We decided to get the Baked Mozzarella. What that sounds like a is a cheese dip with sauce. What it is, is a bowl of warmed marinara sauce with some shreds of mozzarella in it. There was barely any cheese. Plus some stale toasted bread rounds. He had the Meatball Smash sandwich with a traditional meatball. I had the Stoppe Trio and tried the traditional meatball, a chicken parmesan meatball, and the mac and cheese meatball. I had pasta as my side in the creamy parmesan sauce. The good news first: my husband liked his sandwich and thought the traditional meatball was good. I agreed with that. I liked my traditional meatball also and thought it was the best one. The bad news: My food wasn't very warm (for example, the meatballs were tough to cut into). The parmesan sauce had no flavor and did not seem to be seasoned at all. It was pretty gritty and not a smooth sauce. The service was a whole other issue. The servers were never around. I didn't have certain utensils, such as a knife. I don't know if this is because in the larger room of the restaurant, a private party was taking place at the time. If that was the reason, I think this place needs to close down the few tables in the regular dining room and stick to the private party when those go on, because people were getting neglected.

At the cashier, they didn't even show me the breakdown but just told me the total. Later, I checked the price online because I felt suspicious. They of course overcharged me. I believe they brought me a big bowl but I didn't know because it was my first time to eat here. (And the last time). They charged me for the big bowl I didn't order.

We went today and it was not overly busy. It was weird there is no big menu posted. They have flavors listed on one paper near the register and another on the counter with their various mochas. The first problem was ordering. My partner gave the order, the barista started talking to another barista so he had to give the order again. I ordered a butter pecan iced latte- pretty sure there was no flavoring added and the coffee in general tasted bad, it was pretty bitter. Even my partner that drinks black coffee though it was bad.  His mocha was good, but crazy sweet and didn't come with the chocolate drizzle on top as the menu indicated. We got lucky and snagged a table just as our drinks were done, it was crowded, but not packed.  The next issue were the flies! Not sure if its where we sat or what, but the flies were constantly landing on the table and the drinks.  We also got a pastry (pre-packaged) and it was stale.  We did like the crowd that was there, very relaxed and not overly filled with hipsters or the usually tourist of south congress. The overall vibe inside was meh, all dull and muted colors, no vibrancy or \\"warm\\" coffee shop feeling- may be because they're open 24hours a day. Probably wouldn't go back, there are several other coffee shops within a few blocks that are better as far as drink flavor, service, and vibe."},{"name":"TAKE OUT CHARLEY'S","address":"864 Saxon Blvd, Ste 36-37","city":"Orange City","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to Chicago several times and had the beef sandwich and Chicago dogs many times when visiting.

It is necessary to know that this place is quite popular, so you will usually have to wait maybe 30 minutes or so during popular meal times.

To avoid surprises, I asked how much it was and they said it $19 per person (I might be forgetting the cents value). Anyhow, that's not bad at all. From the way some yelpers were describing it, it seemed that it would be way more.The brunch stations have so much food. You have a salad and fruit station, a savory area filled with fried chicken, chicken fried steak, egg and cheese casseroles, broccoli and cheese grits, deviled eggs etc. Then you also have a sweet station of hot and fresh Belgian waffles, strawberries, home made whipped cream, maple syrup, muffins, apple crisp/pie, bread pudding.

The size of the plate and amount of food for the price I wasn't impressed with, but I guess that's the standard in Austin these days. It was $15 for a medium-sized portion.

It is near a lot of the cheaper hotels in Austin which is perfect if you don't want to travel too far for good BBQ. The layout of the store is impressive and you even get to watch them cut and prepare the meats from an overhead camera. However, what was most impressive was how they treat first-timers to Rudy's. Without hesitation, your cashier will bring out a piece of butcher paper with all of their meats (except ribs b/c they're on the bone) and a couple sides of your choice. Think wine/cheese tasting but with savory meats and no stuffiness...which is really more of my flavor! The turkey was surprisingly not dry and the lean brisket was fine. Ultimately we went with the fatty brisket and pork ribs. You can order by any weight and while they list the prices by the 1/2 pound, we were able to order 1/4 lbs of meat too.Good:\\n- Parking is ample and there is little to no wait at all.\\n- you can taste the meats before ordering\\n- Rudy's tangy BBQ sauce is delicious\\n- brisket is moist with a great smoky bark/crust. \\n- all the white bread you could ever want\\n- the creamed corn is creamy and deliciousBad:\\n- the pork ribs tasted more like broiled ribs.

Overall, having tried a trinity of BBQ places in Austin (Franklins, Salt Lick, and Rudy's), I would say Rudy's comes in second for brisket but even then its not a close second to Franklins. Also had to dock a star for the pork ribs being way too salty and having a broiled texture to them.

It's made on flax crackers, which are tasty, but not sure it qualifies as bruschetta.For those of you who like a drank with your meal, they have a few beers and several bottles of wine. The best thing about Counter Culture is that pretty much everything that you eat is made from scratch in their kitchen.

The drinks were delicious and, for vintage cocktails, not terribly expensive at $10 each (if you order right, it's a lot of alcohol, trust me).

I mean, my last review was epic. It got  24  usefuls, 15 funnys and 20 Cools. People seemed to have gotten a lot out of it. I don't feel bad because I'm giving them 3 stars. I feel bad that I'm going to lose my UFCs for that review. Oh well. I've been the MF Sushi 3 times and got their omakase 3 times. Each time I went, the hype has died down. The first time, which is what my original review was based on, was the most amazing omakase experience I had. The second time was good. It wasn't 5 stars, but I still loved it.This third time was a huge disappointment. I found out that the omakase experience can depend on who is the chef that day. If you get the main chef, you might get a great experience. If not, you might get my disappointing experience.However, I have no clue why different chefs would provide a different experience. It should be consistent no matter when I go. The first time I went, we got about 20+ items per person. Yes, it was a marathon, and we were stuffed silly. The third time I went, we got about 12-15 items. What happened? Instead of leaving stuffed silly, I left leaving kinda hungry.I spent $125++/person and left hungry. Plus, they don't even validate parking. Since I paid for 2 people and drinks, I spent over $300 on this, and they don't even validate parking? WTF? And I leave hungry? WTF?Speaking of consistency, I noticed inconsistencies on our dishes. The plating was different for our parties. For instance, the radish would be place in random places. They need to pay attention to that stuff at this price point. Their execution seemed lacking as well. One of the items was their mozuko seaweed salad with quail egg. Well when that dish came, my yolk was already broken. I mean, at the end of the day, it's no big deal since I have to break the yolk anyway to eat it. But seriously? That makes them look like they don't care about their craft. Also, the wagyu beef was tough and stringy. It wasn't buttery and soft like other wagyus I had. Their robata course was a huge disappointment. The first two times I went, I got duck, filet mignon, squid, fish, enoki mushrooms, shishito peppers, and more. This time, I just got sea bass. I was mentally psyching myself for the other robata dishes, and they never came. Womp womp.Also, the pacing of the omakase was disappointing. We were waiting a long time in between items. Also, right after the sea bass, it was dessert. It felt like we were reaching the climax of the show but ended abruptly. Their nigiris and sashmi were still great and top notch. They do overdo their truffle oil though. It's almost like they rely on it a bit too much. But I like it, so I'm not gonna complain about that. (even though I just did)I don't know what happened. Two years ago, I had an amazing omakase. Now, it was a low-value meal since I went home a bit hungry after spending $125++/person. Maybe the price of food has risen since then? Maybe we came on a bad night? Who knows?

We weren't the only ones waiting for the restaurant to open. Perhaps it was the timing - right after the holidays and a Tuesday night - but the place never got more than half full.It's a beautiful restaurant and the employees are warm and friendly. We were sat with a direct view of the door, so whenever it would open a gust of cold air would sweep our table. I would recommend asking to be seated further inside the restaurant unless you like the draft.Since we were there at opening, we got to see the entire selection. Everything was beautifully plated.The buffet is divided into sections - a hibachi section where they also serve udon; a nigiri/maki section; a section with condiments (wasabi, ginger soy, pickled ginger, spicy mayo), sashimi and salads; a section with lightly cooked items (tuna and beef tataki, mussels, green beans); a section for oysters and crab legs, a section for hot/cooked items (shumai, Korean ribs, hot rice); and a section for desserts (fruit, jello, mini pastries, soft serve ice cream).I noticed next to the hot rice was a crepe maker. I was hopeful that it wasn't a mirage but no one was attending it. At the end of my meal, I waited around the area and another diner asked someone if they could make a crepe. The person responsible for that came out and started making them. You only have the option between chocolate, fresh banana and other fruits that looked more like pie filling (strawberries, peaches, blueberries). Because the griddle was on for so long, the crepes cooked really fast so there wasn't enough time to melt the chocolate and warm the fruit. It's a nice addition the buffet, but they should work on making better crepes, not fast food crepes.The sushi wasn't bad and for buffet standards, it was pretty darn good. There were plenty of standard sushi items and inventive rolls. Though I usually despise small sushi rolls, it works for a buffet to allow you to eat more. I'd be interested to see what makes lunch and dinner different.Our waitress was attentive and managed to keep our table clear of used plates. She also made sure we had enough to drink at all times.Though you can see the restaurant (next to the Italian place) from the intersection of Abernathy and Roswell, the easiest way to get there is to enter from Abernathy (just west of the intersection) because the entrance and parking are behind the building."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"When we were in Austin in November I had been told about here by some of our friends that had traveled here before so it was a must try.

Located in an unassuming strip mall, once you open that door, the smells smack you right in the face, and your mouth begins to instantly water.Ambience:  first off, this place is SMALL.  The bar area is cool, with a long bar stretching what I believe to be the length of the restaurant.  Makes for a cool place to hang out b/f you have dinner, but if there's a wait, just stay at the bar and have your dinner there.  There are a few booths by the door, but the main eating area gets awfully crowded and the decibel level is at an all time high during peak hours (around 630pm-8pm).  The decor is a little dated, and the tables are extra close to each other, so you'll get to know your fellow dining neighbors really well, but it's all good, b/c the food you're about to have makes it all worth it.Food: They had a appetizer special--calamari.  THIS was no ordinary calamari appetizer.  These things were breaded lightly, but were huge honking sized calamari pieces served with their signature tomato sauce.  Fabulous....just FABULOUS.I always order the sausage lasagna/casserole.  It comes with soup or salad, but I always order it with a salad with gorgonzola cheese.  Pay the extra money for that stinkin' cheese.  It's creamy and delicious and gets you going for your entree.  The salads are always fresh, crisp and ultra cold, served with spaghetti noodles in a zesty vinaigrette dressing.  I've had their wedding soup also, and it's just as delish (I don't know why other Yelpers have complained about it being salty when it's incredibly flavorful!!).  Now about my entree:  HOLY HELL...now, I've been to Italy, and food is served simply and incredibly fresh.  My casserole was exactly that: simple and incredibly fresh, made with their homemade sausage, tomato sauce, spinach noodles and ricotta cheese.  Sausage is full of flavor, but the tomato sauce is tangy with a hint of sweetness.  Noodles are not soggy, and the green color adds to the lovely presentation of the dish itself.  Get this dish.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.My fellow diners ordered the Chicken Morretti, Chicken Picatta and the Pep & 'Shroom pizza with anchovies.  They all loved and raved about their orders, and after sampling from each of their respective dishes...yeah, I'd rave about them too.  And for all you naysayers of anchovies:  BOOHOO to you b/c good 'chovies add incredible flavor with that yummy saltiness so needed to sometimes bring up the level of a dish.Desserts ordered were tiramisu and the chocolate chip cannoli.  Huge and way way above average.  Don't forget to order these, if you have room after your entree.Service:  it's hit or miss, and you gotta be patient, so that's where I have to take off one star.  They are incredibly busy and it's a family owned restaurant.  I expect the service to not be outstanding, but they still get the job done.  Allocate at least two hours...order a bottle of vino (#127 from the wine list is pretty damn good!) to chill out to.Go but make RSVPs.

I also have to say that the mimosas were not run of the mill... something about them just tasted great. (Hopefully it wasn't my inner child and they're actually just using Sunny D.... lol) but I would recommend!

Waiter did not check in.  3 drinks (one cider, two beers), two sandwiches and two kids' meals at $10 a piece.  $77.04 later, we feel we paid top price for mediocre food and poor service.

I was a little wary of coming here after reading the Yelp reviews prior to coming, so I wasn't expected some 5 star dining experience... My first impression upon walking in on a Sunday night was that it was a little too quiet. There were quite a few other patrons in the restaurant, but the music was a little low, which made conversations awkward because I could hear other people around me talking in depth. Nonetheless, we were seated right away at a 4-seat high top and our waitress came to order drinks within 2-3 minutes. I ended up ordering queso and dip for appetizers and bourbon street chicken and shrimp for entree. My boyfriend ordered the fiesta lime chicken. As many other Yelp reviews have stated, service is relatively slow here. We didn't receive our food for what felt like a long time, but I didn't get an actual count of how long. Our appetizer came in maybe 10-15 minutes? Entree in maybe another 15 minutes I wanna say. The food came out fresh. My entree came sizzling on a skillet so I had to wait a bit before I could comfortably eat it without burning my tongue off. My boyfriend's meal was fine, wasn't terrible. Honestly, I didn't have a terrible experience here like other Yelpers have. Food was average and what you would expect from Applebee's.

Things have definitely changed here in the last couple of months (early spring 2019) and not for the better, and it makes me sad to have to say so.  We have also been coming here for years but the last visit was very disappointing (more so as we brought an out of town guest). The restaurant seemed understaffed and was unpleasantly dirty, with many cluttered tables when we arrived (self-seating) and a LOT of food and spills on the floor that were never cleaned up all the time we were there.  It's true that the salsa selection provided with tostadas has been cut to two from the three previously offered. The margaritas and mai tai's no longer taste like they're made from the old recipes. Out of our three entrees ordered, one arrived wrong and two arrived COLD. The wrong order was replaced quickly and we sent the cold plates back for reheating but when they came back they were barely improved. This can be quite serious with chicken dishes, you know; I've contracted bad food poisoning before from chicken that was left out too long or improperly prepared.  Saddest of all, the dishes no longer seem to be made with the same care and ingredients. We all agreed the mole sauce did not have its old zest and zing, the refried beans and rice were different, bland  and less tasty, and the cheese inside the enchiladas was not what it had been, tasted  plasticy.  This was a very disappointing experience and it's hard to attribute it all to just an \\"off night.\\" There has apparently been a management change or a kitchen change or a new direction taken in terms of ingredients and preparation. Even the printed menus are completely different (can't tell if the prices have changed significantly, but it's possible they have gone up).  We used to really like Arandina's but now I'm not so sure we'd go back again unless it's just for happy hour and simple appetizers once in a while.

It's not laid out well at all.Since we've never been here's we stopped to read the information board to orient ourselves.

Most were essentially slightly beer-flavored water.\\nWorked through the beer menu and found that the Kolsch style beer Das Dom had none of that character, the Saison had no fruity or spicy flavor at all, the Alt had a little roast and hop flavor so was the most tolerable, Pils tasted like a watered down Blonde Ale, and the Brut IPA had a little aroma but nothing else- no flavor at all nor bitterness (not needed for this style). With the large number of low ABV beers in that bunch (there are many session beers out there with lots of flavor... heck even Ruby by McM's is tons better) we decided to try the barrel aged beers- OPM Imperial Mexican Stout which was slightly below mediocre with no mouthfeel again and low sweetness or roast flavor, and City of Thunder, which is a barrel aged Belgian Golden Strong. How do you have nothing but bourbon barrel flavor and sweetness with a beer like this? Not enough sugar in the recipe, perhaps, and too long in the barrel?\\nAccompanying the disappointing beers is standard pub fare- fried stuff, salads, burgers, sandwiches and pizzas. Note that the sandwiches and burgers don't come with a side and cost $10-$16. Side fries or tots are $3 extra, so a better deal is to get basket of tots or fries for $6 to get a larger portion to share. Even the tater tots were not very good, though, and the burger was pretty tasteless.\\nLocation is nice, with nods to the previous tenant Ringside, with A/C for the hotter weather. Service was average.\\nSo, what this amounts to is to pass this place up and wait another 6 months to see if they get their beers dialed in and the food gets better quality or cheaper."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I think the trick is, come for lunch.

They are trying to recreate the ambience (and food) of Northern Thailand which is admirable but Thai BBQ Chicken is NEVER made with Cornish Game Hens. The bird just isn't part of the everyday fare. Cucumber Relish, Peanut Sauce, Shrimp Chips which are SO SO inexpensive are  usually served as complimentary side dishes at no extra charge. This kind of stuff plus the professionally bottled vinegar/Thai sauce gives me pause.I agree it's 'cool', innovative and has a fun vibe but what I truly value is the quality of the food and for me, it misses the mark esp compared to other Thai restaurants in PDX that is more deserving of our patronage. PokPok is more of a venture in marketing and branding than a commitment to good food. Sorry, PokPok but that's how I see it."},{"name":"Brothers Kouzina","address":"25 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"The service and the portions are excellent. I would give it five stars based on that. The problem is with the menu that causes a star to fall. Everything is made to order and delicious but trying to find a vegan menu item is pretty difficult. The menu also goes between traditional greek dishes that are done amazingly well and with enormous well priced portions that you will eat for days later then transitions to forgettable italian american food that are safety items on the best italian menus. I was a little confused by this since the menu is not super lengthy. I would've thought that they should stick to their amazing greek dishes and homemade hummus and such. If you are adding the italian american safety foods to accommodate other people maybe try things for the people that are really needing a safe option like vegans, gluten allergies, etc. Salads don't cut it when you can smell pita bread so it is always nice to have dense options. Overall I would go back consisitently if they had more vegan options. SO many medditerranean vegan friendly ways to cook and yet the menu doesn't shine through with those amazing ingredients. Toss the chicken broccoli ziti and caesar salads and add something amazing like a grain salad or a chickpea dish."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything about this place is awesome!!

My issue is the pricing - the website advertises the meatball flight - 5 meatballs, a drink and a cannoli. That's what I came here for. When we ordered, the server said that there will be a small upcharge for some of the meatballs, not specifying how much. Meatballs I ordered were chicken marsala, chicken parmesan, gator, lamb and crab.  When I asked for the cannoli to go, the server said \\"oh, it's not included anymore\\". And why is it still on the menu and we weren't told when we ordered? The explanation was that it was \\"scratched from most menus\\". Apparently, it wasn't scratched off the website either. When the bill came, the flight was $25.99 -apparently, the \\"small upcharge\\" was $6, not including the cannoli. So in the end, the $19.99 flight cost me $28.49 - with no indication on the menu, online or in person and no resolution offered.As I'm writing this review, I double checked online and there is a mention of $3 upcharge on the pdf version of the takeout menu, but not on the dine-in menu? $3 per meatball is rather steep in my book so I'd prefer to know before I order. The cannoli is still supposed to be part of the flight btw.

I was happy we were able to make a reservation for a large party the morning of because it's difficult to find somewhere to seat more than 6 people at lunch time in Kendall Square.Our server was friendly but took a little while to come by the table. He was quick to refill waters though which I really appreciate. We all stuck with water for the meal as they don't have very reasonable daytime drink options (not having a cocktail and then heading back to the office). Tea/lemonade/cold brew was all in the $4 price range which is just too much. Alas, Kendall Square prices...le sigh.The best part of the meal was my jerk chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun. Flavorful, filling, and topped with a refreshingly crisp slaw. The fried plantains in it didn't add anything for me, but my coworker who ordered the same wanted more so I guess that's just personal preference. All lunch sandwiches are $13 and come with fries and a side of mixed greens. I loved the greens and would've liked even more. The duck fat fries get a lot of love but I was underwhelmed. They were too thick (steak cut) so they were more like big pieces of potato than like fries. One of my colleagues is very health-conscious and she explained to us how duck fat is healthier to make fries in than vegetable oil because it doesn't convert to saturated fat during the frying process. Good to know, but I'll take my saturated fat if I get a nice crispy fry any day.I like the ~idea~ of the ambiance, but not so much the execution. All the walls and ceiling are covered in pallets for that rustic-chic vibe, but honestly it just felt like pallet overload. I think it was probably really trendy when they first decorated 5 years or so ago, but now it just looks like they're trying too hard. Also, the planters on the walls have fake plants in them. Meh.

The crust doesn't leak oil nor does it cool off to become rubbery.

You can keep track of their dailies at http://www.ashwoodfired.com/todays-menu/. The pizzas were baked surprisingly fast in that little woodfired oven inside the food cart (6 to 8min). The sourdough crust has a light and airy texture, perfectly handcrafted. The topping variety can be funky but totally well harmonized. More important, you can taste they're fresh.

Let me tell you about it.Our meals consisted of the El Cubano ($11) for she and the Lechon Asado ($12) for me. I got a nibble of her ginormous El Cubano sandwich. OMG, such flavor! I ordered the Mariquitas, Cuban Rice, and Black Beans with my plate. We shared the plantain chips. The Mojo sauce (olive oil, garlic, citrus) was one of those things that you are certain is a death sentence due to the decadence of the flavors. Her sandwich was big enough for two, as was my overflowing plate--but neither of us could maintain, so it disappeared before our very eyes!Lunch here is a great bargain with portion sizes identical to the dinner menu. Very quiet, dimly lit atmosphere, and excellent service by the courteous hostess and waitstaff. So very many dishes on the menu to try, I know I'll be back soon! I may not even last until supper!P.S.

However, the most stellar dish of the evening was the seafood special with scallops and crab.  OMFG.  I dont know how much wine and garlic they put in the sauce but it was simply intoxicatingly delicious.  For desserts, we enjoyed the tiramisu but wished there was more rum in it.  The panna cotta with raspberry sauce could have been presented better on a plate.  It was mediocre at best.  Next time, I'd probably skip dessert and head to the ice cream shop a few doors down.

My protein of choice was the lamb. But sadly the lamb was tough.  Fortunately, however, my friend had opted for the beef, and was willing to share.  The beef was tender, and definitely the better choice of the two given this one experience.  The noodles were thick, wide, with some chew, and I managed the tingly feeling from the spiced red sauce the noodles and meat were bathed in.I enjoyed the Pork Stew Rougamo here more than I had Gene's Flatbread sandwich.  The pork was moist and tasty, the layered bread crisp, hinting at scallion pancakes without the scallions.  The lemonade I had requested arrived as a can of lemonade and iced tea in one; tasty, and without bubbles.

It is difficult to judge whether the noise level for a typical Friday is the same as the noise level as my seating but it was very difficult to hear my friends talk (Something to consider if you have lots to talk about with friends!)I found it strange with how my dishes didn't come in a typical appetizer and then entree structure but I didn't find it obstructing my dining experience. We ordered the mussels, octopus, country lamb, zucchini chips and the fried sheep cheese with pita bread. I always order their octopus because it is tender and has a lovely charred smokey flavour. It was a lot larger tapa size which I don't mind at all. The country lamb was tender and very big in size with flavours that were exactly the same as how I had it a few months ago.  The mussels were cooked well in a tomato and white wine sauce and came with a side of pita bread to soak up the jus. The zucchini chips stole the show for the night. I am not a huge zucchini fan but with it covered in a light golden brown batter and the chips being paper thin, I was munching on it the whole time. The tzatziki dip made it even better but be warned, those chips are so thin that using your fork crushes it. The fried sheep cheese is salty, lemony and has a slight brine taste to it. It paired very well with the pita but I found the pita all across the board to be quite hard and I had to tear it with my teeth. It was unfortunate to witness, with front row seats, a heated argument with the front of the house and a customer. I understanding reservations can be hectic but the manager could have found a solution such as seating them immediately at the bar (which the hostesses immediately did without asking) instead of fixating to what has happened in the point of view of the restaurant.

The first time I came to True Food Kitchen was for a lunch interview, and there wasn't an opportunity to highlight my unique Yelp capabilities.  True Food showcases a menu of nutrient heavy seasonal foods based on the Anti-Inflammatory Diet created by  Dr. Andrew Weil who helped establish True Food Kitchen. The food is prepared from scratch in an open kitchen.  The menu is very friendly to people with a variety of food sensitivities.  It is the first time I have seen a dessert menu that had all but one gluten free option.   Austin is one of several locations throughout the greater U.S.  For lunch I had the soup of the day with gluten free pita.  Wow, the pita bread came heated and was amazing. I almost asked the waiter to confirm it's gluten free status. I don't usually like soup, but this soup was full of flavor, tasty.  The fresh squeezed green juice drink I had was amazing.  I was determined to visit again for a dinner to officially Yelp my thoughts to the world.  The opportunity came soon, as this place has become well known for quality experiences. On my second visit with friends,  I had the Poke Bowl, and shared a Key Lime Pie.  The Poke Bowl was DELICIOUS.  No surprise.  Full of delicious ahi tuna that balanced well with all the unique flavors in the dish.  I couldn't finish it all as I wanted to save room for dessert.  The portions were decent. Which makes the price tag reasonable.  It paired nicely with the Rose I ordered from the menu for National Rose day. I like that you can order by the glass different volumes of wine, the 9 oz is perfect.  They have a decent organic wine and cocktail selection to choose from.  The Key lime pie was tangy, sour, and lightly sweet.  Just like I enjoy it.  I hate the creamy, over sweet versions that you often find in restaurants. This version is how I prefer it.  Definitely save room for dessert as all the options sound intriguing.  I will definitely be back to try their brunch and other menu options.  My only wish is that Seaholm restaurants validated full parking prices.  They only validate 1 hour, and who stays for only one hour?  Maybe if you are with family members you don't particularly care for.

I didn't have someone to share a platter with (the friends I was with all wanted lamb which I don't eat) so I was very happy to try the dinner special which was a chicken breast stuffed with feta and spinach. It was divine! Moist and flavourful. The only thing I would change is the amount of vegetables it comes with (there should be more). But for $18, the size of the meal was more than sufficient as a solo diner. Service was overall good. My only minor complaint is our server's knowledge of the menu.When I initially asked about the special, she said she thought it came with Greek salad. When she came back with drinks to take our food order, I said I'll have the special as long as it does come with Greek salad or some vegetables and she still hadn't checked! So when I got my meal and it was with roast vegetables (and a small amount at that), I was a bit disappointed.

Though I was expecting buckwheat noodles, I got yakisoba instead. That is not to say that the yakisoba weren't good- they actually were; seasoned with fragrant pepper and vegetables throughout. I'd definitely get them again, but just wanted to give people a heads up!The fried chicken was PHENOMENAL! Really crispy chicken- and the salt and (chili) pepper was amazing. I'm not lying, but here was probably the best salt and pepper chicken I've had. Not neglecting the vegetables- the broccoli was properly cooked- just blanched enough so that they retain their crispness.The scallion pancakes were okay. I'd get them again, just because I've always loved scallion pancakes growing up, but they are not too memorable.The milk tea- contrary to what I've heard- was good. Granted, it tastes like just adding boiling water to milk tea mix without any actual tea in it, but I loved the sweetness of the milk \\"tea\\" drink. It has an odd taste though- it's like \\"watery and chalky\\" at the same time, so it might put some people off (my coworker who told me about this place), but I like it. The boba pearls are slightly over cooked compared to other places, but this is not an issue for me.Above all, the service was AMAZING. For a fast-casual restaurant, the workers were really attentive, checking up on my food and asking how everything is. They also held friendly conversation too, and even BUSSED my plates for me. There's a bus bin that customers are expected to leave their plates in (similar to a tray system at fast food restaurants), but upon finishing my meal, they were really helpful and nice to not only get me some two go boxes, but they just gave off an extraordinary customer service vibe."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Definitely a culinary experience worth trying when in Portland.

Mind you, my family and I drove all the way from Oviedo, FL to try out their sushi burgers and fries. The taste of the burger was nothing that stood out from any other sushi place I've tried.

The first time I went, I got a specialty sandwich (Santa Fe BBQ chicken, which is BBQ chicken, bacon, and Monterrey jack cheese on a french roll) which sounded good to me, and WAS good, but not sure it was 5 star good. It's ok, life goes on.So today, I really put some faith in the Yelp community, went back to Sam LaGrassa's, and ordered based on what fellow Yelpers recommended. I should clarify, that the most popular items were something I had never tried before: pastrami (WTF is wrong with me, I know, but don't jump the gun). So, when I say I trusted Yelpers, that is what I mean, and I ordered the Diablo Pastrami (Rumanian pastrami with monterey jack cheese, thin sliced bermuda onion, apple wood smoked bacon, chipotle mayo, bbq sauce, and hot cherry peppers served on a french round roll.), without knowing what I was going to get. But hey, the pastrami sandwhich has out of this world reviews on yelp, and if you don't believe me, take a look at about 3 other reviews and you'll surely see what I mean.First glance, is that reviewers are right when they say these 'wiches are piled HIGH with meat. Yes, they are $13-$14, but yes, you really are getting that much more meat than at a normal sandwich shop. I was worried I might not even be able to fit the center of the sandwich in my mouth (nevertheless, I persevered..). I was at first a bit disappointed that my sandwich was on a french roll, because I felt I should have gotten one more exotic, but no worries there because although the roll is delish that is not the highlight of the sandwich. Toppings were just enough, and the meat was addictive. The sandwich was SO flavorful, I couldn't get enough of it. Even though I could, because I actually could not finish the whole sandwich, that's how much meat there was. So, moral of the story, I will absolutely be back, despite price and despite the fact that I frankly am not sure whether I could finish a whole sandwich. There are two ways you could look at this: 1) come to Sam LaGrassa's, because it could be the best pastrami you have in your life. 2) \\"Never fly first class [pastrami], because it will ruin coach forever.\\""},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"It is a city of books!!!

We actually came here after the Taza chocolate factory tour since these places are so close to each other.

Perfect for dates, special occasions, seafood occasions, and so much more. Though our wait without reservations on a Sat night for 2 was an hour, the dinner service itself was 2 hours. Excellent service, delicious food, fun yet classy atmosphere...couldn't ask for more. The only downside is the wait time in between courses. To share:\\n- Beet salad with pistachio and goat cheese - ($10) - Really fresh flavorful flavors in a small portion. The beets were sliced and tossed in a citrus vinegarette dressing. They were REALLY stingy with the pistachios though. I honestly couldn't find a single sprinkle of a nut. - Spicy broccoli rabe - ($7) - This side dish reminded me a lot of stir fried Asian vegetables in a slightly spicy sauce. The vegetable itself was a jade green, nice and crunchy, flavored well, slightly bitter with a hint of spiciness. Delicious, refreshing veggie side dish that isn't bogged down with too much butter!- Mushrooms ($6?) - This little ramekin filled to the rim with buttery mushrooms was absolutely delicious. Warm, melt in your mouth, and super 'shroomy. Everything you'd want in a mushroom side dish.- Coleslaw ($3) - A really nice crunchy light coleslaw of shredded cabbage and carrots. Nothing special, but still tasty. For ourselves:\\n- Weakfish entree ($28?) - my brother went with the \\"weakfish\\" dish. It's a beautiful piece of whitefish that is served atop sauteed mushrooms, pearl onions, and potatoes. - Scallops ($33) - 4 large juicy fresh pieces of scallops seared to perfection served atop a bed of buttery barley. Absolutely delicious dish. I didn't leave a single crumb on the place. My brother asked our (wonderful) waitress if ICOB did anything special for birthdays, and she said \\"SURE DO!\\" Within 15 minutes, out from the kitchen came a complimentary poached pear atop almond cake served with \\"happy birthday\\" written in chocolate sauce. It's all in the details when it comes to this place. Starting off with the house sesame bread served with a cardamon honey butter to the (loose leaf!!!) ginger lemon tea I ordered, which was served with a heated tea mug.

I brought my parents here and it was just as beautiful and the service was just as lovely as previously, but the food was disappointing to the point where I don't see myself coming back again.We ordered the steamed mussels (again) and they were still delicious in their unique basil cream sauce. But for our main dishes, we were all disappointed. I got the sense that everything kind of tasted the same, and on top of that, everything ran salty.My mom ordered the Pan Seared Tilefish and although the fish itself was different and its description for how it was prepared was different, it tasted just like my Pan Seared Coalfish from my previous visit, which I had described as \\"not entirely swept off my feet with the flavor--there was nothing wrong with it, it just wasn't that memorable or noteworthy.\\" I ordered the Bouillabaisse and enjoyed the variety of seafood in the dish but it also had the same tomato-y, salty flavor to it as the pan seared fish--it was a little uncanny how everything felt like it was on the exact same note. I also had a problem with how salty the Bouillabaisse was.My dad initially ordered the Squid Ink Tagliatelle and asked for it to be softer than al dente but it still came out overly firm (consistent with my previous dining experience) and there wasn't much to it besides tomato sauce and again, a lot of salt! We mentioned it to the staff, who were so accommodating and professional and offered to replace it. He ordered a Bouillabaisse like mine and requested it to be light on the salt but it still came out salty.

From the delightful egg sandwiches to their gourmet pastries, FITSC is a MUST try for anyone visiting the city! I am going to take this review to share my thoughts on this specific location and what FITSC has to offer! :)Location: FITSC accessibility has greatly increased in recent years. When they only had the one location on 4th, it was a challenge to find a seat or parking spot on the weekends. This still calls true for the German Village location. There isn't a designated lot that I saw, so be ready to exercise your parallel parking skills for a spot along the street. On the brightside, the location of this place is great if you're looking to fill your afternoon with other fun things to do in German Villiage since everything is in walking distance.Coffee: The coffee isn't outstanding. I've had better coffee from other local cafes in the city. However, the New Orleans iced coffee was tasty and I would order it again. It's essentially your classic iced coffee, but creamy and sweetened with molasses. It reminded me of a similar drink I had at Blue Bottle Coffee in NYC (possible inspired?).Food: The egg sandwich is a must try! At first, you're slightly weirded out by the egg patty. However, it is one of the fluffiest preparation of egg I've ever had. It complemented by perfectly toasted bread, bacon and arugula. (aka savory galore~~~) I also love their pastries! Their danishes and cinnamon rolls are the BOMB! You can't go wrong with anything but the I brownie (its boring and lacks depth of flavor).Atmosphere: I came here on a Saturday morning and it wasn't the cleaniest from the high traffic of customers. It seemed slightly disheveled from the morning rush of coffee lovers. However, any other time this is a clean, light and airy establishment.

The food here all comes in big portions, but quality isn't traded for quantity.  Everything here tastes amazing.  The Thor Viking Dog lived up to its name.  It was a massive hot dog with mashed potatoes, crab salad and onion crisps.  I've never had a hot dog like it before and I was loving it.  The crab salad might night be a welcome addition for everyone but it created a great flavor contrast with each bite and I didn't mind it at all.  It was a great replacement to something like sour kraut, which I usually like with my hot dogs.  The Ragnarok burger was my favorite.  Sharp cheddar, crunchy onions, lettuce and a house-made sauce all on top of a juicy burger patty that was perfectly cooked.  It was truly a burger fit for the gods.  It was a bit messy but that's because I was so impatient to eat it.  I recommend you slap on the Viking helmet like I did and go to town on this thing.  You won't regret it.  The people here are incredibly friendly too.  There's just an overall great vibe about this truck.

It's got quite the following and boasted many glowing reviews before I stepped thru the door.  It serves mainly northern Thai dishes, so don't expect to see any Pad Thai or yellow chicken curry on their menu.  I let the waitress suggest some dishes and my family and I were not disappointed, it is however, not your average Thai restaurant.  The bar was heavy on whiskeys, some coming from as far as Japan, and the bartenders were all very adept mixologists providing excellent service, as did our waitress and server.  Would I go again? probably not, my palate leans towards the southern Thai dishes, but I'm not sorry I tried it out, it was an overall wonderful evening for me and my family and reasonably priced, with excellent service.  We did come on a rainy weekday night, I hear getting a table on a weekend can be a bit of a wait, and if I was going to wait, I'd rather wait for a table at Red Onion."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Coming from New England, I've never seen so many Thai restaurants in my life, you can't take two steps in Portland with out coming across at leas one Thai restaurant.  That being said, most of the restaurants are VERY Americanized, to the point Thai people might not even recognize the food as Thai.  Pok Pok was a little different, but not by much.I was visiting Portland with several people from Thailand, and we were told that this was a popular restaurant in Portland, but every told us it was \\"Farang Farang\\".  Still we tried it out for ourselves to see what the hype was about.The atmosphere is really cool, it almost feels like your eating at a food stall.  The menu looked amazing, although it was way too big (usually a sign that the dishes are just OK).The waitress was OK, I'm not sure any of them were really familiar with actual Thai food.  One person in my party asked for som tum \\"Thai Style\\".  In every Thai restaurant in the US, Thai people ask for things to be made Thai style, because Americans usually can't spicy and fragrant Thai food.  The waitress snipped back \\"What do you mean by that?\\" and then insisted the dish was spicy enough.  It wasn't.  All the food followed this pattern, they are on the right track and the chef must've gotten some good recipes, but the flavors are wrong.  All of the dishes lack the balance that you need in Thai food.  Although, Americans might find the food spicy, it isn't, instead all the dishes are overly sweet.  Thai food is about balance, and you can tell cooks aren't familiar enough with Thai cuisine to achieve that balance.  Kao Soi, for instance, is one of the hardest Thai dishes to make, and the Pok Pok version was laughable, it's so poorly translated that it's barely recognizable as Kao Soi.There are a few gimmicky items on the menu, like the moo dang that comes with bread (the menu says this is normal in Thailand).  None of us had ever heard that before, and after several people searched for it, it does turn out that a few restaurants in one small region do actually offer bread with moo dang.  That being said, they made the moo dang wrong, again, not grasping the Thai style of making food.Our overall impression is that they may be better than the food carts that make \\"Thai\\" food out of bottled sauces, but they really have a long way to go before they can call what they are making Thai food.  Maybe it's a difference in culture, but even the Americanized Thai restaurants in New England and New York are much more authentic than this.This isn't to say the food was bad, but this is not Thai food.  For all the hype, pretentious attitudes, and the price, I was expecting something a little more Thai than this.  We met up with even more Thais in Seattle later that week and asked around about this place.  Everyone giggled and agreed that this is an American restaurant that uses Thai style ingredients, and if you look at it like that it's not bad."},{"name":"Studio Movie Grill","address":"3204 Margaritaville Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"Movie was good but I brought my own food this time, I also got the very top far left seat so that I could recline my head between the seats as the seats do not recline back very much  but the legs do extend out."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Long line but it moves really fast.

That would solve its greatest drawback:  the waits are too damn long. We've been coming here forever. They treat pork with the respect it deserves. They make great home style breakfast potatoes. And the pancake batter and fixings are always pretty adequate, if not really darn good.But has mentioned, the wait is always very long unless you get there right away at opening. Because of the number of people there, it seems the servers are prone to disappearing for long stretches. They are always good, but it seems like they're overworked. My thought is you need to open one on the west side, and one around Bridgeport. That would probably alleviate some of the overcrowding. But honestly, this place might be a little bit too Portland to stoop to such things.But you know, if you don't want to do that just keep leaving money on the floor. If you want to pick it up, I think you can pick it up in other locations.

But the Spinach Salad w/ peaches, pickled red onions, goat cheese and candied hazelnuts begged me to order it.  In return I begged my date to order the meatloaf so I could taste it. Both were good but the salad was better and I ordered a side of Roasted Sweet Potatoes that were almost as good as the salad..The Brunch Buffet is good but I wish they offered more light options as in eggs with veggies - lots of butter and heavy cream on this buffet.  I prefer not to have food comma after brunch.  So on my last couple visits I have stuck with the Smoked Salmon & Bagel, Roasted New Potatoes and Chile Cheese Grits.  All very good but not worth the all you can eat buffet price. My favorite Brunch item here is the Champagne and Pomegranate Juice - yummy stuff - try it.They offer 1/2 price Happy Hour not sure of the hours.

Therefore the salads that I make are just leaves with a bunch of loose stuff on them that inevitably falls to the bottom of the bowl. It makes me sad. It makes me want a burrito. Enter sweetgreen. Delicious roasted brussels sprouts? You'd never make those for your salad unless you were trying to show off for your vegan friends from out of town. You can get a squeeze of lime on there, that's fancy right? Avocados that aren't brown, how do you even buy those in the store??? Peppers, beets and spicy broccoli, all gloriously chopped and seasoned for you. When they mix it all together, what you have isn't just a bunch of leaves with confetti-food scattered throughout. It's a SALADE. It has a THEME. (Burrito cravings begone: Jalapeno lime vinaigrette with chicken, corn, peppers, crushed tortilla chips, avocado and a lime squeeze.)  And it tastes fantastic. And you barely think about the fact that you could be eating a flabby grilled cheese and chili fries. And after, you feel full for more than 2 hours, even though most of the salads are under 600 calories. And you don't even care that you spent $10-ish dollars on a salad, because you didn't have to chop any chicken, fondle any avocados, steam any vegetables or dice a goddamn thing.

Well, what's more outrageous is Vegas charging you $18 for Grey Goose & cranberry with little effort involved other than pouring.  let me tell you the labor or love that comes out of making these juices.  there's washing, cutting, peeling, and having to push them through the juice machine.  furthermore, do you know how much ingredients it takes to make one little cup?  how much juice can you squeeze out of spinach & kale???  lastly, washing the juice machine is not easy feat.  having \\"juiced\\" at home really makes me appreciate the efforts of these hard-working folks here at Juiceland.  whether you're lucky to live in Austin to be able to try these juices, juicing is so beneficial to one's health that you can be your own creative chef at home and make your own recipes.   these wild recipes at Juiceland have inspired me to use some funky ingredients in my own juices.there's a cute garden outside, but since parking is limited to 15 mins, who has time to enjoy?  unless you ride your bike here.Thank you Juiceland!

We had a reservation at 7pm, and arrived on time, however he told us we had to wait because the people at our table \\"hadn't left yet\\". So he continued to sit groups of people about equal in size as ours (including walk ins) at various tables throughout the restaurant. When we finally were seated, about a half hour after our reservation, we happily ordered and ate our meal. Not 40 minutes into our meal was the host attempting to rush us out of the restaurant. He would send the busboys and waiters over to our table to collect items (even going so far as to taking our water glasses and napkins). He would glare at our table and continually walk by. He also came up about three times to ask if we wanted anything or if we are done. We were finishing our wine while visiting, and there certainly wasn't anyone waiting for a table, so it didn't seem like a problem to relax and visit a bit. The worst part is he wasn't even subtle about it. He would talk to the waiters while rolling his eyes and pointing at our table, or he would summon the busboys from across the room to come collect silverware and napkins from our table. It was gravely obvious that he was intentionally making us uncomfortable. \\nIt greatly saddens me that there are people out there who treat others with such disrespect and arrogance. He doesn't appear to have much respect for other people and unfortunately reflects greatly in his business. \\nI would highly recommend against coming here if you are looking for a good meal in a relaxing, kind, and comfortable environment.
